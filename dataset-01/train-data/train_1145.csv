1,Never received,I still did not received this item.Hope it will arrive soon. I buyed several other things on amazon but this is the first time I don't get what I've payed for.
5,No amount of stars,"This album is pure genius. I listen to Human Nature every day. I remember blasting it out of my friend's Bose speakers while driving around in college. Oh, how I'm going to miss him. I was so looking forward to his tour and his new music."
5,It's a GREEEEEEEEEEEAT Album,"15 years after it was made it still remains one of the best albums that can ever be heard on the face of this Earth!! It reminds of the good old days of school when we sang, danced, studied, ate and slept to the music of ""Thriller"". The MJ saga will continue to the next century too. Why don't they make music like this any more??????????"
5,Incredible way to come back! ~ Thriller 25,Thriller can never be beaten...Thriller 25 is THE best way to celebrate Michael Jackson and his tribute to music all around the world! I can't wait until he starts his tour!! I love you Michael Jackson!
5,Michael is the SH__!!!!!,"I've ALWAYS been a Michael Jackson fan regardless. I recently purchased the 25th Anniversary Thriller and haven't been able to listen to anything else. I play it while running on the treadmill, washing dishes, mopping floors, etc, etc! When you can listen to an entire cd from start to finish without skipping songs, that a HUGE plus in my book! The Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary Thriller Edition is ALL THAT AND THEN SOME!!!! It does not disappoint...it NEVER did!!!!"
5,"GREAT VOCALS, MAN!","Did you know Jackson's vocals for ""Billie Jean"" was done in only one take? Musically, I think it is not his best, but obviously the general public appreciated it. Point is, people don't buy music if it sucks. It has to be good to some degree. Ask anybody who grew up in the 80s, and NOBODY (not even me) will say that he was not a huge pop-star icon. Even though it was released 16 years ago, copies of this album at libraries are always 70%-90% checked out. If it was so horrible, why would the sales equal to being 1/5 of the American population today (1 out of every 5 Americans would own this album)? Besides, you can denounce every opinion in the book, but the facts (it beat worldwide album #2 in sales by almost 100%) remain in stone."
5,One of the greatest albums in hsitory...period.,"This album was amazing. I bought it because I didn't have it. Not because I really wanted to, but because this albums is a MUST-HAVE for every person that can hear. Of course, after I listened to it I fell more in love with Michael. I had Jackson's later stuff first and then I started to explore his older stuff. There is nothing to say except ""buy this album - NOW"".There is 0% chance that you will NOT like it.5 out of 5 stars all the way."
5,"God is love, therefore...","This book is an exercise in finishing that sentence. Placher sets out to understand what it means to confess that the nature of God is found in love not power. In the first part of the book, the nature of God is explored. Placher contends that God is vulnurable in love, eternal in a way that allows for the flow of events rather than a static state, and Triune. The second part of the book explores some contemporary issues in theology: the use of Scripture and treatment of marginalized groups of people. The final section of the book deals with how Christians should live, both within the church and in the academy. This is a wonderful book. If you truly believe God is love and want to explore the implications of that belief no matter what the consequences, this is a book for you."
4,A Good Anime,"This is a solid anime, my only complaints would be some of the english dub sucks, and normal episodes of every day life are pretty boring. But the action episodes are awesome and it has great music."
4,Action TYPE MOON STYLE,Excellent series so far about battling figures from mythology. Though the dub is left to be desired...
3,Love is not good during war,When you miss a loved one you look at pictures to remind you of them but when the lead character of this anime misses his father he creates a warrior! This anime is about a recurring war that blew up a city and left two survivors: the lead character and his father. Even though the series has action and drama it is still a love story and once that starts it kills any reason other than seeing it end to watch the show! It builds up to it but the action dosen't change it just adds to the story and there's a big twist that adds to the confusion of how the show will end! My advice is to watch it before you buy it.
5,This is my favorite show,"The quality looks fine to me. I LOVE this show and I am so glad to own it on DVD. Is there only 24 volumes, or will there be more every couple of months? I can't wait for the classic 39 to be released on DVD. I hope there will be a bonus documentary in the future."
2,No Honeymoon,"I'm not buying these and judging by reviews, you aren't either. Firstly, I have these on a very capable VHS set by MPI, and judging by screenshots, the quality isn't any better on the dvd's. Also, they seem outragously high in price for something I already have on VHS. They do not seem to be in any order and the packaging is totally unattractive. Hey MPI, condense the discs, put these all in a reasonably priced massive set, remaster them, perhaps include extras, and we will buy it. As it stands now, I've been in a holding pattern for over a year."
3,Honeymooners Complete Series,"Mine is not so much a review but a request. That someday, the producers would put together a ""complete series"" set, a la the ""I Love Lucy"" set, which would include everything, Classic 39, Lost Eps and the 50th Anniversary special."
5,Very helpful!,"This book is amazing! When I started to read it I couldnt help but think :"" Oh my God! This is our life! This is exactly what is happening to our family! That is MY child!"" Its like somebody was watching us for a long time and decided to describe all the problems of raising the difficult child. I definetely advice you to read this book if your child is different from others, has her own diffucult temperament and need help in productive cooperation with the family, peers , other people and this world in general))) this book will help you know how !"
2,Ehhh there are more choices out there,I was recommended this book by a family friend. It is a very generalized book that doesn't offer you real scenarios and how to put things into practice. I didn't find it helpful at all. I ordered The Pocket Parent and am loving it.
3,First half: recommended. Second half: please skip.,"Don't be defensive reading the title to this book. The author is not trying to say your child is bad. The truth is, some personalities are more difficult to parent than others. Some kids are easier to influence, generally happier, and not as sensitive as other kids. I have one of these 'other' kids. He spent much of his waking day either frustrated, getting into trouble, lashing out, or whining. So we went to a counselor who routinely sees parents of 4 year old boys. He recommended this book as a resource to understand our kid better, and to help show us that the difficulty we were having wasn't our fault, it was our kid's personality, and it could be overcome. The caveat was: don't read the second half of the book. The second half discusses what to do and how to discipline these kids but the author gets it wrong. I cannot recommend reading/following the last half of the book."
4,A Relief to have some tools,As with some of the other reviews I found the title to be a bit distracting but felt the author truly understood my child and our issues. I believe I am better equipped to understand and nurture my son now that I can identify the root of his behaviors.
3,not enough help for us,"Dr. Turecki has a difficult child and he describes some personality traits that help one to understand one's child and the various obnoxious behaviors. That part was helpful.The reality is that he does give some clues to helping the behavior of some kids, but our son was 2.5 yrs old and there is little to help with a difficult age and a very challenging child.Perhaps the best part of the book was that our son didn't fit the category of ""mother killer"" close, but not really. I guess I can be relieved about that. The rest of the time, I wonder when my volcano boy will choose to erupt."
1,I wish I had read these reviews first!,"I bought this piece of [garbage] before reading reviews online. Thankfully I didn't pay much.I've seen the unedited version on VHS before, and it's pretty good. But this is unforgivable. It almost seems like it was edited for broadcast television.What a waste of time and money!"
1,MISREPRESENTED ITEM,"I ordered what was billed as the ""unedited version"" and received a fully edited version. Never heard back from the seller."
2,Poor quality,"Saw the original movie years ago, but the film as it was put on this DVD was of very poor quality, both visually & with sound."
3,Harrad Experiment plus,If you're wanting Harrad Experiment on DVD this is the only available source.
2,DVD Version Highly Edited,"I expect the seller to inform the buyer that the offered product has been highly edited when I read a technical description of a movie. I saw the original movie several years ago and was impressed with the method the director addressed several issues. Unfortunately, the DVD version of this movie cut key parts of the movie which detract from its overall message. Very disappointed with Amazon's limited movie description. CAVEAT EMPTOR."
3,Author waits for sequel. Harrad 2000!,"As the author of the novel I wasn't consulted when I finally saw the film. Alas, it leaves off on the story about half way through--with lots of scenes and dialogue I never wrote--and the film never explores the group marriage of Insix--too hot a subject for the1970's when it was made--AND NOW!There is no Harrad yet--and the Harrad Idea is not outdated. But the movie is fun to watch--and the swimming pool scene a delight with Don Johnson and Laurie Walters--young, and prettily naked. When the movie is run on network tv--the frontal nudity of both Laurie and Don is eliminated- proving that even in the 1990's the continuing sex revolution is not over. If the current owner of the video rights would contact me, I'd be happy to put a few pool scenes on my website Anyway--if you are a film maker the time has come for a sequel. Bob Rimmer"
1,well..i guess..it wasnt the real one!,I was looking for the real R rated version ..but the one i've got was the PG13 Version..that made me mad..cause all those R rated scenes were not in that movie and they have also cut it into a 50 minutes version or something..that was too bad...
1,Edited for TV (G-rated),"The Platinum disc corporation release of The Harrad Experiment is a heavily edited version for TV. Naughty words are bleeped out, and all scenes involving nudity have been deleted. The catalog listing for this DVD should reflect that this is NOT the R-rated theatrical release of 1973."
4,Great oboe concerto disc,"These pieces are all standard repertoire for the oboe and are all charmingly played. Derek Wickens plays the Vivaldi, Marcello and Haydn and Douglas Boyd plays the Mozart. Derek Wickens is elegant in his playing with a finely focused sweet sound, while Douglas Boyd is perhaps a tad more robust. Their playing is typical of the generation of English players who hit their stride in the 80s and 90s - the sound being a little less ""English"" than their predecessors. A nice disc to own. You will not be disappointed."
3,False Advertisement,"The only reason I was happy with this purchase and didn't return it was because it was a great deal as oppose to what is in the store. As far as price comparison between Amazon and the store, Amazon was the way to go even if it didn't have everything in the box it said it would.*THERE ARE NO BONUS WIPES. I thought this would be an awesome deal because the wipes came with it, so it said. The wipes can actually help, but there were no wipes. It's not even the box pictured. The product you are paying for when you make this purchase is only a Monistat 3, nothing more, no wipes, and it is not the same box. Hope this helps."
1,"THIS IS NOT THE TOM WAITS FILM, this is a different film!!!","The wrong picture is displayed for this film, this isnot the classic TOM WAITS film but a different filmall together. I am not sure why Amazon has not fixedthis!!! Please correct the listing! I am a big TomWaits fan and was really let down to find out I orderedthe wrong film!"
5,Good read. Makes you feel like you're there,"This is part one of a trilogy that gets better with each book. The author has that rare ability of creating a gritty realism that makes you feel like you're there, fighting space pirates or wandering through cities built into asteroids. If you're one of those who hope and believe that our future lies out there, then this is a story for you. Fletcher makes you believe that there may yet be a place in the universe for the ordinary guy."
4,Pretty good book,"I really enjoyed this book as a ""fun read"". I think it could have been better but it is for younger readers so it's pretty good. I learned a lot about how to care for cats and kittens because as you read about Mandy caring for these kittens you also learn how to care for kittens. The vocabulary is for younger kids so if an eight year old were to read it, they to would have been able to learn what I did."
4,Tabby in the tub,Summary-Well this book all started at animal Ark where they had a cat that was in need of help Mandy hopes to help her parents treat animals all shapes and sizes. Mandy loves animals so she can't resist not to help any animals that are in need of help. Mandy and her parents helped the tabby cat before and after she has her kittens.Character Description-Mandy is just a nice and friendly little girl that loves animals. Dr. Emily is Mandys mom she works at Animal Ark and she loves animals to. James is mandys best friend he helps her out with the animals at Animal Ark.Your Opinion-My opinion was that I liked this book it was funny in some parts and sad in other parts. I had fun reading this book. I hope I read another book from Ben M. Baglio that is as good of a book as this book was.
3,Not quite the best way to close out a series.,"This isn't the greatest way to close out a series, honestly they could have just ended it with Rhea Gall Force, it seems what made it's previous entries in to the series great was lost in this ""Okay"" Conclusion."
4,A must have for fans,"Turin Brakes have that whole mellow acoustic ballad -Radiohead thing goin on, especially on a song like Long Distance. But the main track and reason to buy this 3 track single is The Bees version of the title track. The Bees are not only one of the best bands in the UK, they make this song sound so good that it makes Turin Brakes' original sound like little kids trying to cover a Radiohead song."
3,Must see if you like Ann Dvorak,"Didn't expect much from this movie as Lana Turner isn't really my cup of tea. More of a Joan Crawford/Bette Davis fan. But really enjoyed the movie and thought Turner quite good and believable when she'd show her hard edge. And yes, a girl like this would be attracted to Milland's goodness/unavailability.Liked ALOT her moral dilemna and really found myself on the edge of my seat whether she's succomb to the evil guy....who really was also good. And Ann Dvorak! She is a tragic hoot. A great performance by her.Yeah, the story is pretty dumb...but the performances are really good.Clothes, my particular passion....ok....Lana was a bit thick in the waste to carry them off."
5,Fun,"Fun, tragic and corny: plus Lana Turner! What more could you want. Tom Ewell is a hoot, before Marilyn in the ""Seven Year Itch"" Carol Burnett should have parodied it in the manner of her ""Mildred Pierce"" take-off"
1,A Waste of Your Time,"A completely forgettable vehicle for Lana Turner, filmed in black and white so not even the clothing can be enjoyed. Turner plays an eager young model who falls in love with a married man. Unfortunately, Ms. Turner looks older than her thirty or so years in this picture, making her unbelievable as the fresh faced girl from Kansas. Her meteoric rise to the top takes about ten minutes and why she can't get a date with anyone but Ray Milland, a married man from out of town, is not too clear. It's the kind of over blown sap-fest contract players were forced to submit to back then. I'm a big fan of Lana's, and this was just too boring to finish watching."
2,Very short life!,"This laptop battery died in just under 6 months! Since I'm usually running off AC power, I had expected more performance and lifespan from this battery. I cannot recommend this battery."
1,Unauthorized battery,"Although product is advertised as compatible with Lenovo Thinkpads, it is not. When battery is affixed, an ""unauthorized battery"" error will appear on the laptop and the battery will not charge."
1,"Defective Battery received from Brilliant Store, Inc.","The battery I received from Briliant Store, Inc. was defective. I used it for literally 3 days and the battery ""crashed"" on me: even though it was about 50% charged the computer keeps thinking that it's at a critical level of 3% or less and hibernates. And yes, I did the whole ""charge 100% and then drain for 3 cycles to break in the battery"" as instructed. And no, I did not have this problem with my old battery.Bad experience. Bad product. Will edit review based on my experience replacing this battery from this company.I thought this was a good deal but if I had known this would happen, I would've spent a lil more and got a legit battery from Lenovo or something."
5,7 Vital Steps to Recieving the Holy Spirit,This is a must read for anyone wishing to know what the bible says about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. I highly recommend this book.
4,Met my expectations,This was a replacement for another Thermos bottle that I had for many years and it works just as well as the previous one. The pour cap is very deep and reduces the volume of liquid that can be stored in the bottle. It actually holds 32 oz instead of 34 oz. I don't use the pour cap feature because I find it easier to just unscrew the cap and pour coffee directly from the bottle.
4,Sturdy and keeps liquids hot for 24 hours,"Good product overall, well designed, well built. Solid stainless steel.Why did I take away 1-star? The stopper/screw down lid has a rubber gasket that sort of smells, also, even after a few uses I feel that it's showing integrity wear. I hope it lasts, as all I put in there is black coffee, only time will tell if that little but critical piece will hold(the rubber gasket seal)."
5,Best thermos ever!,"This is one great product. It is light-weight, a great size for one person and it keeps my beverages hot from early morning till evening. So much so, that I have to be careful not to burn my tongue, even after it's been over 8 hours since I filled it up!I just love it!"
3,Does not live up to heat retention as claimed,"I purchased this product as it claimed to retain the heat of the fluid contained inside for a period of more than 10 hours. As instructed, prior to placing my coffee into the thermos, I fill it with hot water. After draining the hot water, I then fill it with the coffee and seal the thermos. As I leave my house very early each morning, I am filling the thermos with my coffee at 3:30 a.m. However, I do not actually pour my first cup of coffee until 7 a.m. While it is still warm, it is by no means as hot as the manufacturer claims that it should be."
1,Vacuum insulation failed after six months,"I used this thermos to bring my coffee with to work with me. Then it stopped insulating.I'll admit that it worked very well for six months, and I used it every work day. My coffee stayed very hot. Unfortunately, it now won't keep my coffee warm for more that an hour or two.I never dropped it, or slammed it against anything. It has no dents in it, and the stopper still works fine. One day it kept my coffee hot, the next day it didn't. The insulation just stopped insulating.It only worked for six months, that's not acceptable. A quality product would have lasted longer."
4,Great,These bottle are great. Keep my coffee very hot for at least 5. And even after 7 or 8 hours I still can drink it (but not it is not very hot any more).I don't give 5 stars because the bottle came with a scratch. It was not too bad. Then I decide not have the trouble to switch the product.
1,"Bad product, don't buy!",After 3 months- Leaking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- Coffee(or tea)gets cold quickly!- bad quality of stainless steel - can't get it clean inside
4,Keeps your piss warm,"I peed in this on a road trip and when I emptied it the next day it came out steamin' hot! The opening provides enough girth for accurate filling (no spills like those undersized pop bottles), and the screw top ensures that there are no internal parts to be left dirty. I like my urine steril!"
1,Questionable,"MADE IN CHINA.The plastic had an unpleasant odor, so I returned all four that I ordered. I balk at drinking out of products that are made in the most polluted nation on the planet... Not to mention their bad reputation for constructing items containing lead, poison, and other dangerous chemicals."
3,Great Until Dropped in the Parking Lot,I've had mine for a little over a year and it works great. Fell out of my hand in the parking lot this morning and now there is a quarter-sized dent in the lid that looks awful. That never happened with their products from 30 years ago.
3,LEAKS!!!,"Not 100% satisfied with this product. For one, everytime I pour a drink it spills all over the place!!! this is because the inside cap must be screwed on super tight. This makes it way too inconvenient and impractical to be an everyday botlle!!! Also size is too big for everyday bottle. It is not sporty. Furthermore you must twist cap twice before drinking-- Way too much work to be practical & used for everyday outings. This thermos is ideal if you would like the best cold & heat retention one time out of the year- say on a camping trip. I wouldn't even recommend for going fishing, as you will be frustrated by the difficulty of twisting two caps- which you must do 4 times!!! twice to remove & twice to seal closed. Save your money & get a sportier bottle- you will be glad you did! Also get one that's made here in the states- this one is made in china!! thumbs down."
1,DID NOT KEEP MY PAPERS DRY,"I really must say that I'm unimpressed with the quality of this Nissan Briefcase Bottle. Contrary to the wonderfully lengthy name, it functions rather poorly as a briefcase. Not only did I have to crush my papers to fit inside the narrow opening, but when I poured coffee into the thermos IT SOAKED INTO MY CAREFULLY COMPILED REPORT ON THE JOHNSON ACCOUNT. Weeks of careful case work gone in an instant. Please take my advice and purchase a traditional briefcase instead, and possibly a coffee pot that you can keep at your desk. I know I've learned my lesson."
3,Thermo bottle,Not too bad although not the same workmanship that I had been accustomed to experience by previous Nissan products
5,Stylish looking,Glad I bought this. Unbreakable. Well insulated. Good on bed table for cool late night drink. Will fit in car cup holder.
5,Thermos Saves Money,My husband loves this thermos for work. It is very durable and holds enough coffee to get him through the morning and keeps it hot!! It saves money for us instead of him going to convienece store every morn!
5,Great Product Pathetic Second Rate Shipper!,"THis thermos lives up to its description and reviews. Well made, rugged and keeps hot beverages hot for hours. I just finished a nice warm cup of sencha I made this morning and it is now 3 in the afternoon. Seal is well constructed and am looking forward to enjoying it for a long time. Shipping has been a nightmare with ONTRAC, however. AMAZON, please DUMP ONTRAC. I had this delIvered to my place of business so it would not be left on my doorstep. NOt only did ONTRAC leave it outside, but left it at the wrong address(and some lucky soul has a nice Nissan Thermos now. I contacted ONTRAC and was told to file a claim with Amazon. AMazon handled my claim quickly and I received the replacement thermos the next day. UPdate: AS of 9/27/10 ONTRAC is still delivering my AMAZOn packages to the incorrect address and leaving them at the door during business hours. ONTRAC DELIVERY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE! PLEASE STOP USING ONTRAC AMAZON!!!"
1,Strange taste of petroleum,Very disappointed. I've previously owned a thermos and have no issue with the taste. This one tasted of petroleum and after soap and water cleaning I noticed the water droplets lining the walls inside seem to stick to it and does not dry up even after 12 hours. It looks like there is an oily film inside. The water tasted metallic and I almost choked from the first mouthful. It's so bad I can feel my throat getting rough from tasting. Do not buy this!
5,Amazing Product for All Climates,"My goodness. I bought this during Arizona's ""winter months"" to use for tea and coffee. Hot liquids will stay burn-your-mouth hot for about 8 hours. I'll brew coffee in the morning and by the time I'm leaving work, my coffee is still to hot to drink right away.But what's even better about this thermos is how cold it can keep ice water. Here in Arizona, as some of you may know, it gets hot. Really hot. 110-115 deg. f. hot. During the summer months here, you need to drink a lot more water than normal. This thermos is a savior. This week, I filled the chamber with ice and then poured water in. I forgot about it under my bed and found it couple days later. No joke: in 48 hours, only half the ice had melted. Amazing.I'm pretty sure this thermos has vortex to another realm where liquids don't change temperature. This product is well worth the small price tag."
4,"Good product, could use some refinements","A well-functioning and sturdy product, but could be improved. The stopper is plastic, which means the liquid inside could be in contact with it for hours. The outside of the cup is stainless steel, but the inside is also plastic, which means you're drinking out of a plastic cup.Surely Nissan can find a way to have you and your beverage in contact with stainless instead of plastic. Who knows what that plastic might be doing to you?"
5,first use impressed me.,"So i brewed a cup of green tea, and filled half of the thermos with cold water and half with the hot tea, leaving the liquid a little more than lukewarm. I placed the thermos in a fridge and expected the liquids to chill overnight before work. The liquid was exactly the same temp the next morning, and then at lunch was about to lukewarm. I didn't expect that after sticking it in the fridge overnight.The only con is that it is a little big but i'm good with it.Good product. thinking about buying a smaller version for soups."
5,I love this thing,"It keeps my beverages hot for hours exactly as it advertises. I've used it for water, tea and coffee all with great results."
5,Keeps everything warm!,"Love that this keeps my drinks warm. Since it is usually 30 or below where I live, it is great to break this out any time of the day and still have a warm drink."
5,Excellent Plus Thermos,"I can't say enough for this thermos. It is compact to carry back and forth to work, easy to pour without having to open it all the way, and unbreakable unlike my glass lined carafe. AND it stays hot, hot, hot!!! I put coffee in it in the morning (7:30) and when I bring it home at 5:00, I still have leftover hot coffee. I've even left the coffee in over night, and it's still hot in the morning. The miracle thermos!!! Now I want a carafe that will work as well. The only thing I wish the thermos had would be some type of handle. I've dealt with that by buying a tall gift bag to carry it in. It's one of my best Amazon purchases."
3,Made in China,"For many, the importance of where an item is made is of no importance. However, for those that do mind, I would just like to clarify the item IS made in CHINA."
3,"Great-looking, but that's it.",Liquids as susceptible to temperature change as would be in a regular drinking glass. Doesn't actually function as a thermos but I'll keep it anyway because I like the look.
4,warrantee sheet stuck in bottle?,I got my thermos today...Very happy with construction and performance per other reviews.... BUT... WHO WAS the IDIOT manufacturer who decided to stick *FOLDED* paperwork INSIDE the bottle!!!!!!!! This is just plain STUpid! What a pain!
1,Does't work after half year,It is very bad quality. Stop working after half a year. Very dissappointed. I will not trust this brand anymore.
4,A good thermos,"I was looking for an old style green Stanley thermos. I have had them in the past and recently was with a friend who had a very, very old one. It reminded me how well it kept coffee hot all day and I decided to get one. After researching I was convinced that after selling out overseas, Stanley no longer made the same awesome thermos. This Nissan is a fair replacement. Looks great, holds up well and keeps coffee hot for 4,5 hours in my case."
4,Thermos Review,"This is a very nicely made product. It is stainless steel inside and out and therefore is easy to keep clean and will not break if it happens to get dropped. It does not leak and does not drip when pouring. Mine sees daily use and I have had no problems at all.That said, it would be a bit easier for me to use if it had a handle and a larger cup. All in all, I'm happy with it and would recommend it to anyone needing a high-quality, high-usage bottle."
5,Great!,Good quality but bigger than I thought it would be. 34 Oz is good for keeping soupy food warm.
1,Poor quality,"I bought this product two months ago. It work perfect during the two months and then just stop keeping hot.... Yes, only two months"
4,Excellent product,Pros: Keeps water warm more than most other flasks that I know of. Water is warm for at least 10 hours.Cons: I wish it came with a spout/ push button for easily dispensing water.
4,Awesome for the office!,"I bought this for my husband to take tea to work. If you don't have time to make multiple trips to the kitchen, this will keep your beverage of choice HOT for the entire day. Not warm, but hot, as in just as hot as when you made it. We take it on road trips, and it's so nice to have a hot cup of tea whenever you want it! The lid does get hot when you pour into it, but not so much that you can't hold it if you don't fill it all the way."
4,"Great for coffee, finish scratches easily","Works great for hot liquids, cosmetically the finish seems to scratch easily, seems typical for most thermoses. Works pretty well with cold water also, but better with hot."
1,Toxic Plastic smell,"I bought this thermos to replace a very low cost one that I had owned for several years that I'd purchased from IKEA. I certainly expected an upgrade. While the bottle seals well and performs well, my only complaint is the cover. I typically use the cover as the ""cup"" for the beverage I'm toting. The black plastic inside the cover apparently isn't meant for hot liquids because a toxic plastic-like smell is produced when hot liquids are poured into the cover. Because this changes how I use the bottle, I'm disappointed.If you typically carry cold liquids or aren't interested in using the cover as a cup, then I think you would be very happy with this product."
1,Worst Thermos - 25 bucks down the drain.,I originally wrote a great review for this but after a month it no longer keeps my coffee warm for more than an hour - I am unable to exchange it since the exchange date expired while I was on vacation - I returned and it will no longer do its job - what a waste of funds. I followed all directions on cleaning it - never used bleach - only mild detergent and water. I will reconsider purchasing from amazon directly.
4,Excellent thermos,"We selected this thermos because of its thermal insulating properties and its lifetime guarantee. We had one that failed to keep things warm after 4 years of service and it was replaced under the guarantee, no questions asked."
4,Excellent thermos,"This vacuum thermos does an excellent job of keeping drinks warm. It's a little difficult to clean due to the narrow opening and long body. Although the thermos does not retain any taste of the drinks, but the plastic cap does retain coffee smell."
4,Great. Keeps Coffee hot all day!,"We bought this for my husband since he has to have his coffee throughout the day and his company doesn't have a pot. He loves it. He makes the coffee at home in the morning and it's still scolding throughout the day. Good Buy. Would recommend for sure. Also, it holds about 2 large cups of coffee (for him)."
5,Great water thermos!,"This thermos bottle appears very well constructed, mine's made in China & not Maylasia unlike another reviewer's. It's very tall but still fits in a standard backpack. It's leak proof & does what Nissan Thermos claims: keeps liquid hot & cold for 24 hours. I tested it by filling it with boiling water, capped it tightly, after 12 hours the water is still very steamy hot, & after 24 hours it's still hot but no steam noted. The instructions say it must be hand washed, & no carbonated beverages. Though not specified, I guess also no freezer. Very happy w/ bottle."
4,Highly practical,"Highly practical, no excess chemical substances, good size for travel or daily use, though large-slightly clunky-awkward to bring everywhere.26 oz might be suitable alternative - ideally either accompanied by small carrying shoulder sack."
4,Thermos Nissan FBB1000 34-Ounce Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Briefcase Bottle,"Liquids stay incredibly hot for the whole day, but the taste is very strange and plastic-y. And I did wash the bottle twice before use.The taste is fading slowly so maybe the flask needs to be 'worn in'."
5,Excellent Thermos,We use this thermos to sterilize water for baby's formula and it stays hot for almost 24 hours.It's cool to the touch outside so you don't have to worry about handling it with bare hands after its full.It holds just the right amount of ounces for mixing formula for feedings and baby cereal.Great Product
5,Still great after a year.,"My picky wife says this thermos works really well. It has kept hot liquids HOT. She has tried others and they do not work as well as this one. Thinking back, at first she did not want this thermos when I bought it (June 2011) for her to take to work. She's glad that she gave it a try.Just think, number of cups of coffee per work day in one year times the cost of a cup of coffee. WOW, what a huge money saving product. Thanks Thermos Nissan!!!"
5,Wow,"Seriously... I opened this after over 12 hours and my coffee was still steaming. I was shocked! I mean you had to look for the steam, it wasn't obvious, but I don't care, after 12 hours if it's even still warm I'm impressed."
3,Great while it lasts,"I absolutely loved this Thermos when I bought it. It performs quite well and is easy to clean with dishwasher soap or Dip-It coffee pot cleaner. However, the construction on the one I got was not as hardy as I would expect from a fully stainless steel thermos. After 6 months, the bottom cap came off and I had to glue it back on. After a year, the stainless steel cover came off of the plastic cup/cap. It still worked quite well, even if it looked a bit battered. One other note: before Thermos bought Nissan, one of their unique selling points was their one-piece, seamless thermal liners. I noticed that these Thermos Brand Nissan thermos appear to have a seam.I would only recommend this thermos if you really treat it gently.I have replaced this thermos with the hardier-lookingThermos Nissan 34 Ounce Stainless Steel Bottle w/ Folding Handle. It's bulkier, but hopefully it will hold up better."
4,Good Thermos - but why do they say 34oz when it's not?,"Unless I got a knock-off (very unlikely) - then they should not be calling this 34 OZ by any means. It's about 32 OZ. When I measure the volume (actually weigh the water in it... 1ML = 1 Gram by definition) - the capacity after placing the stopper in it is about 900 ML or about 30.5 Oz. Other than that, it is a great thermos, just don't expect a full liter to fit in the bottle. Granted, if you fill it to the brim, it's about 975 - 980 ml and about 33 oz...but put the top in and your down to 30 Oz/900 ML.But - I can live with 30 oz and it keeps hot things hot and cold things cold."
1,Crud Build Up,"I bought this thermos back in December. It is already something I will not use. It has a crud build up inside that cakes off when I put my coffee in it. I am trying to get a refund or replacement. I will let you know if it was an easy, hassle free process."
2,Disappointed,I am quite disappointed with the quality. I have purchased two of these and both have broken within one year each.
4,It does what it's supposed to.,"The claim of being ""dent proof"" by the pamphlet that came with the thermos is far beyond ""a stretch"", considering I dropped the lid by itself from maybe 3 feet in the air and it has a visible dent in the steel now. Other than that it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and the thermal retention claims of keeping hot drinks hot for 12 hours, and keeping cold drinks cold for 24 are spot on."
4,Early Rita,Probably in the 1960-s early -- A daring combination of just one piano plus Rita.Pianist was the stellar Swedish star Bengt Halberg. It shows how well she could hold upby herself with her unfailing musical instinct and taste - colored by the slightest hintof her Dutch accent. She is from Rotterdam.
1,"If I could give this album ZERO stars, I would.","STOP!!! DON'T BUY THIS CD, NOR DOWNLOAD ANY SONG OFF IT -- unless you are content to listen to RE-RECORDINGS! EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS A RE-RECORDING! NOT ONE OF THEM IS THE ORIGINAL, RADIO-HIT RECORDING! Consider yourself warned."
5,Lots of Hits for little money,Great value! I am so happy that I stumbled on to this deal!! Great array of 60's songs for very good price. Thanks
5,Beautiful book.,"The fabulously beautiful illustrations are the highlight of this book. Pictures of children at bedtime merge with colorful celestial images to create a feel of dreamland. The familiar lullabies are quiet and sweet, perfect for bedtime. There are 3 verses of 'Twinkle, Twinkle.' And you may know 'Golden Slumbers' from the Beatles song that uses part of it (modified) in it's intro (""sleep now darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby...""). My 15 month old loves this book so much that she recently started carrying it all around with her, and has even insisted on napping with it."
3,"good, not great","effective w/ black cohosh for hot flashes, but not as good as Nature's Way which cost a bit more but are worth it. But these were good enough that I finished what I had bought before replenishing w/ the Nature's Way."
4,CD Track Listing,Part 2 of a 2 CD set track listing:1. Ruined In A Day (Radio Edit)2. Ruined In A Day (The Ambient Mix)3. Ruined In A Day (Reunited In A Day Remix)4. Vicious Circle (Mike Haas Mix)
3,Only suitable for light weight duty,"This is a perfect fit for anything light (i.e. a kitchen cabinet door), but will not handle anything heavier."
2,"Defective, poor craftsmanship","Cute lunch bag, but very disappointed in the quality. The bag is sewn improperly and won't zipper. Hope this seller will send a replacement quickly."
2,Oner Man's Poison,"I'm glad but puzzled at the raves over this dated book published in 1928. Apparantly one man's poison really is another man's meat, even when it smells and tastes like mothballs. Myles Connolly used Mr.Blue as a mouthpiece to get a lot off stuff off his chest. Just when I thought I'd go mad with all the preaching, Mr. Blue told an eerie and compelling tale about the end of the world and I felt a glimmer of hope. But then in a trice he went back to mouthing Connolly's views on religion, society, relationships, and I gave up on page 111."
5,Ever new Mr. Blue still in circulation,"I first read Mr. Blue in 1963. He changed my life. Myles Connolly's tale of one man who embraces life with a rare exuberance is so refreshing. Although written in 1928, this book refuses to die as successive generations pass on the story. Mr. J. Blue takes living what it means to be Christian seriously. Both funny and full of pathos, Mr.Blue is truly a Twentieth Century American classic."
5,Must have for a Marxist Library,"If one wants to understand Marx's thinking, then this is a great first step in the long journey. This is not a book for a casual reader, nor is it a book for those who do not honestly seek the rigor of Marxism as more than a mere caricature that it has become over the decades; however, if you are not repelled by the previous clauses, buy this book. A great work of scholarship!"
5,XR1200 or XR1200X Oil Filter,"Why pay the dealer's exorbitant rate when this little filter twists off easily with a small adjustable wrench, found in nearly every household?Remember: Harley-Davidson found that the standard 5 micron filter was too restrictive on the XR1200 engine because the XR has twice the oil pressure of the regular XL Sportster. Don't buy a regular Sportster filter for your XR1200 or XR1200X!KN-171B is BlackKN-171C is Chrome (The XR1200 is *not* a Chrome motorcycle, unless your screen name is magicrat)And, of course, be sure to swing by the XR1200 Owners Group (Google it, since I can't post a link), and tell them JoeP sent ya!"
4,Have used these for years,"I've been using these filters on my Harley's since 2002. They're easy to install and remove due to the convenience of using a 17mm socket. Other filters require an oil filter wrench of some kind that wraps around the end of the filter and is in contact with the crank sensor wiring. By using a 17 mm socket on the K&N, you can eliminate the potential of damaging this wiring. I normally purchased the Chrome version because it looked good with the other chrome items I had on the Electra Glide, I've since purchased a Road Glide and the black version seems to match better. Either chrome or black, this is a great way to go if you change your own oil."
4,"Still good, but starting to be out of date","This is a highly useful, very clearly and lucidly written, and quite comprehensive coverage of cryptography up through the mid-90s. Unfortunately, quite a few developments have occurred since it was written - for example, the new AES encryption standard is not covered. And some of the coverage of legal and political issues is now obsolete - a lot has happened in this area in the past few years. It's still a very good book, but it needs an update."
4,Excellent for novice cryptographers w/ technical background,"This book is great at explaining cryptography to beginning cryptographers with experience in Math/Computer disciplines. It's strength is in it's use of usable examples. After sitting down with this book for a few hours, I felt as though I had enough base information to make informed decisions about cryptographic issues."
4,"Great reference book, OK read","Although this is still considered the bible of cryptography, I read it like a novel and found it only ok, but it serves as an invaluable reference. I find that quoting pages out of this book stops people arguing with me when I talk about Crypto in my job.Key thing about this book is that it describes many algorithms that you have never heard of and never need to. Having an understanding of what is mainstream and what are the basics will help you.At the end of the day if you are serious about Cryptography then you really need to get a copy of this."
4,The best introduction to cryptography I have read,"If you are already a cryppie or other security professional, this book will not add much to your knowledge. But if you are a programmer or other systems person with a desire to familiarize yourself with the field, I can't recommend this book highly enough. A reasonably solid mathematical background is required to fully understand the algorithms, but the book is structured in such a way that you can skip most of the heavily technical stuff and still get a lot out of the read.Because this is essentially an introductory text, generality is the name of the game. Pretty much everything is covered, but to a low, or medium at best, degree of depth. (Only DES is covered thoroughly.) However, the reference list in the back is huge, and you can use it to easily track down any more detailed information that you're after."
5,a great book for Avid Crypto fans,"This is not a simplified overview, be warned. Simon Singhs The Code Book is for armchair readers. This is a comprehensive and detailed examination of how real world cryptography is done. It's an excellent book for programmers seeking to implement security into their programs. It is also an eye-opening look at how even the cleverest security algorithms can be compromised. The emphasis is on illuminating just how difficult it can be to protect communications. The devil is in the details and Schneier gives you the details but in an understandable way."
4,The Tomb of Knowledge,"I read this book 2 years ago. I find myself still using it as my main reference to this date. Bruce Schneier covers all types of algorithms and related topics in depth; very nice additions are the risks and known attacks against mentioned algorithms as well as well explained counter-measures. With a good knowledge of C this book is sufficient to write a well thought-out and theoreticaly secure encryption product. This is a ""must-read"" for anyone interested in the field."
4,"Dense, but Useful","Schneier's book is a great primer for programmer's looking to expand into crypto. It gives a good overview of protocols and implementations, and goes the extra mile in telling budding cryptographers what has already been tried and proven to be weak.My only detractions are the stunning amount of references embedded in each page (a testament to how well-versed Schneier is on the subject) and the lack of mathematical depth (which is the key to truly understanding cryptanalysis). Obviously, the copious amounts of references are where the mathematical depth can be found, but it would have been nice to extend the work another couple of chapters to cover more details on quadratic residues and NP-complete problems.All in all, a must have for implementers of cryptographic algorithms. Maybe a third edition that covers the last few years will come out soon."
3,A good overall explanation if you don't want all the details,"The explanations are good in this book, but if you want to build your own cryptographic algorithms, do not expect to do so with knowledge from this book. The source code in the book is incomplete, functions are missing, code syntax is wrong, and it is poorly written. It does not go into the specific details of implemting cryptography (like Large Integers, repeated squaring, etc..)"
3,Only good for beginner,"If you have no knowledge on cryptography and want to get some information, this book is suit for you. If you are doing some actual work, it's not a good one. The book does not cover sufficient mathematic knowledge, and contains errors. E.g., the proof of RSA decryption is absolately wrong! Can't beleive!"
2,Runaway text,"I've never seen so many pages devoted to pure text. Man oh man, is there a lot of talk--yak yak yak. All technical issues are detoured, inviting the reader to check out the references listed at the end of the book (all I have to buy is 1,643 references--gee, thanks). I find it disheartening that a 700 page book on cryptography doesn't give out a lick of information on the actual subject. If you like a bunch of talk and some hand waving explanations, then this book is definitely for you. Engineers and computer programmers may not be satisfied."
1,No CD,"I feel totally ripped off. What idiot would publish code these days with no CD or download. I would glad to have paid $40 more to get a book that comes with a CD. Now I have to, get this, snail mail the author and wait 4 weeks to get the CD. Serves me right for not reading the negative reviews before buying the book."
5,Great reading for someone who is curious about security.,Security bible. Contains indepth technical details of security protocols and concepts.
2,Fails to explore the mathematics behind crypto,"Although this book presents a broad introduction to various crypto methods, it devotes little or no time to the actual mathematics/implementation of a REAL crypto system. Apparently Bruce feels that the C source code in the back of the book is sufficient! This book is fine for someone who isn't interested in the esoteric details of crypto. If you want a more in depth analysis, I recommend the Handbook of Applied Cryptography or Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography."
2,Get what you pay for,"I bought this as a ""filler"" to get my order to $25 for free shipping, and that's about the only good thing that came out of the transaction. The cup is extremely light, and besides that it's top-heavy, which mean that it is prone to tipping in my older car's cupholder. The stainless steel that you see in the picture is very thin. This is basically a plastic cup with a lid."
5,David is Updating his autobiography!!!,"I have read David's book when it first came out, and loved it! I learned alot about the experiences on and off The Partridge Family set. A definate must-read for any David Cassidy fan.David Is Updating His Autobiography! David has just signed a book deal with Headline Books in the UK to update his autobiography. The book is due for publication March 5, 2007.(for more David Cassidy items, please view my Listmania list; The Ultimate David Cassidy Guide. Thank you.)"
2,AS AUTOBIOGRAPHIES GO...,"David Cassidy and The Partridge Family were a gigantic part of my youth -- nobody could have loved them more than I did growing up. It is not the stripping away of the myth and the magic of the Partridge factory that I dislike so intensely about this book -- it is the badly written prose, and self-involved wallowing that turned me off. You would think that if David chose to use a real author to help him put his incredibly compelling (and it is) story down on paper, it would read like a real BOOK. This reads like the teenage diary of someone who definitely needs a lot more therapy - and should learn how to punctuate sentences at that. Have no fear, I will always love you David, but a book writer you are not. Maybe one day someone will do you justice in a much-less-subjective biography, one that does not take itself quite as seriously as you and your friend Chip do here."
2,Not what I expected!!,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. Althoughthis did have some insightfull moments into ateen idol's feelings and frustrations, it turned into a brag book of sexual encounters!! The book does not help Mr. Cassidy gain the respect he so desperately wants, precisely because he sounds like a bragging teen, trying to show he is not a virgin!! Certain revelations are really tasteless such as bragging about penis size, and his re- jection of Susan Dey's sexual advances!!"
3,An OK book,"This is a pretty interesting book and I learned a few things that surprised me about David Cassidy. His life proves that fame and fortune are not all they've cracked up to be. Yes, it is kind of hard to pity someone with all that fame, money, and sexsexsex thrown at them, but I think in the end he has made out OK and wish him all the best in his future career on broadway and TV. This story should also provide a caution to those following in his footsteps, to make sure you have a good lawyer. As I understand it, David's image was put on things - T-shirts, lunchboxes, etc. - and he had no control at all over it, or received proper compensation. I do have to admit I had a massive crush on him at the time of the Partridge Family, only mildly alleviated today! This is the most interesting of the cheezy quickie pop-star bios, ie. Burt Ward and Mickey Dolenz' efforts."
3,A good surprise,"Over my youth, david cassidy was my idol, so as soon I knew that a biography of him as issued I got as fast as I could, but for my surprise many aspects related in this book were amazing for a fan just like I still be. I would reccomended this one for those who has been missing those good days of episodes of the partridge family.Just for easy reading"
2,New Book is Better,"If you are interested in the constant whining of this guy, who is now a lounge lizard in Vegas and would be selling shoes in Fresno if not for the Partridge Family, try his more recent autobiography, published in England, ""COULD IT BE FOREVER."" It's more forthcoming and a little less self-serving than this title, and it updates his father's death and his relationship with his half-brothers."
3,"Very insightful, but too much ""kiss and tell""","I'd really rate it 3 3/4 stars. For me, here's what keeps it from being a 4 or 4 1/2 star:While DC promised not to deliver a ""kiss and tell,"" in many ways, this is exactly what he did. There were times when it seemed as if he was actually preoccupied with that over all else.If you can get past that, it is, however, a telling look into the often lonely and overwhelming life of someone who rocketed to stardom at an early age... and, in many ways, lacked the savy and maturity to avoid being swept away by it all.Two old cliches seem to apply... ""Looks can be deceiving"" and ""All that glitters is not gold.""A must read for anyone who has enjoyed his music over the years."
5,If you're a true David Cassidy fan....,"...then you have to buy this book. It tells you about the REAL David Cassidy, not the made up image portrayed on the Partridge family. I used to be his ""#1 fan"" when I was a kid so never in a million years did I guess what the real David was like. I'm so proud of him for telling us all the truth about his life and feelings. This was a very good book. He was honest, and the book was extremely interesting. There are some good photo's in there too."
1,lost my respect,"He is not a gentleman.Susan Dey was very young then (18-23), and she was a good friend to Cassidy---at a time when he needed it.Instead of honoring that friendship, now he writes details about Susan for all the world to see.He is not a gentleman.(You will never see this kind of trash from Susan.....she was the only one on that show who had Class.)"
3,Worse than expected,"The book was in worse shape than I thought it would be. Pages were falling out, etc. Guess it was ok."
4,"C'mon, Reprint It!","I, too, saw that documentary on E! Television. Now, I want that book! I don't know if publishers frequent this site, but they should reprint it and hype the hell out of it. An original Partridge Family fan, I parted my hair in the middle because of David (and I still do!). I know that I am not alone. What with all the 70's rehashing going on, I am surprised that this publisher is missing the boat."
4,I would give it a 5 star if I could only get ahold of a copy,After reading all of the reviews about this book it makes me want to read it even more. Unfortunately I haven't been able to successfully locate a copy. Maybe they will republish them when the movie comes out. That would be a good idea(hint hint to the publisher). Because along with the movie people may want to read it(a lot of people think that books are better then t.v. because they elaborate more on it while t.v. may cut things out). I'm am sure that this book is really interesting with a lot of insight as to the goings on behond the scenes. If anyone knows where I can get a copy please let me know. ThanksNote to the Publisher:(If you even look at these reviews) Look at how many people are asking you to republish this book. There are a lot of fans out there that maybe never got a chance to reads this book (Me being one of them). So please if you want to make a lot of people happy republish this book. Thank you.
3,The wild life of T.V's Keith Partridge,"I am a Partridge Family fan, so when I heard that David Cassidy wrote a book about his experiences being Keith Partridge I wanted to read about it.David Cassidy is very candid about his life. he starts off talking about his childhood as the son of Jack Cassidy and Evelyn Ward. Then for the majority of the book he goes into the teen/adult years of his life spend having sex with MANY woman and doing alot of drugs. I was not happy because by the title I thought he would spend more time talking about the Partridge Family, but hwe did not. It was an interesting book though, and if you want to know more about David Cassidy this book is for you"
5,"C'Mon, Get Happy","This is the most AWESOME book ever! It tells the real story the way it really was for David. I admire him for being able to survive it all. He is truly a remarkable person and in so many ways! The best to you always, David."
1,Can't find it,"I wish the publishers would reprint. would like to read this book as I was a big fan as was most girls in the 70's. C'mon, make us happy: reprint"
1,Please,"Why is it that has been actors feel the need to write a book that nobody will want? After reading this book, I have determined that my thoughts about what an egomaniac this guy is does not go without merit. Page after page of ""I"" ""Me"" and ""I am"" makes you wonder if the guy needs to see a shrink.Now he performs in Las Vegas, which rumour has it will be a short run. This guy needs to pack it up and head to Branson where the rest of the has beens roam.The book details a life that is hardly interesting. ""Poor Me,"" he must say a hundred different ways. Who cares? Most people have to work for $6.00 an hour, and this guy complains that he's too famous. Poor, Davie.He needs a reality check on how real people live, and that's all I got out of this book.Jared."
2,ASHE reader,"I purchased new and received perfectly on time, paid over $115 only to discover that the back cover was cut and the front cover had scuff marks. Had to tape it so that back cover wouldn't tear some more."
5,Quite Good,This is a very fine look at the role of Mary in the New Testament. It is the first in a 3 volume series that covers Mary from the Bible through the early Patristic period. Certainly it is quite good for scholars who are looking for a solid introduction to Mariology. It follows the guidelines set out in Lumen Gentium chaper 8 and the encyclical Marialis Cultus. A very solid work in general although it depends rather heavily on Fr. Raymond Browns views of the New Testament.
5,Opening our eyes to the Mother of God,"The role of the Virgin Mary in the Church is misunderstood by many. Bertrand Buby discusses Mariology is a straighforward and interesting manner. He deals with issues such as the brothers and sisters of Jesus, the image of Mary, The Woman as a symbol of the Church and the gospel references to Mary in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Buby writes is a refreshingly understandable manner."
5,5 stars for the price,"for about $8 for original Casio, you cant beat it. i had seen open boxes, or damaged ones selling in the local flea market for $15. Bought a couple as presents for high schoolers in the family"
4,Looking forward to next CD,"The beat grabbed me right away from track 1 - actually since I have cheap speakers it almost blew my system away.There is definitely Marvin Gaye inspiration here? ""Chasing You"" and ""Children of the Son"" have hints of his ""What's Going On"" album. There's such flow through these songs - relaxing. (""Children of the Son"" was my wife's favorite.)For me, I heard the duo's Hall-and-Oates-like symbiosis best in ""Just Wanted You To Know"".""Withdrawal"" was great when I read the lyrics; hearing it produced now allows me to love it in two ways. Unfortunately, I can't point out exactly what makes me like it so much with music. I just like it - that's all.This is a very progressive definitive sound with retro foundations.I've already heard a cut from Zwei's next CD. Look out! Get this one while it's still available!"
1,"How do you say ""GARBAGE"" in German?","If any CD deserves less than a ""1"" it's this one. Instead of spending so much time coming up with excuses for mispronouncing ""zwei,"" these two should have worked on producing a better CD. There's 'deep' and then there's 'trying to be deep.' This duo is definitely doing the latter. The overly ambitious vocals and amateurish music make for a horrible combination. Wanna turn a friend into an enemy? Give them this CD as a present."
3,Quickly outdated,"I teach internet searching to senior citizens. I thought this might be a great book, but I was underwhelmed. A few observations:- Google is changing so quickly and frequently that no printed materials stays current for very long.- Lots of the ""tricks"" are so specialized, you would never use them.But, as it says, the instructions are simple to follow - and that goes a long way!"
2,This was once a great book...,"Although this was once a great book, I made a mistake in not checking the publishing date. The book is simply too old to be of much good due to the changes in Google. However, it does have a bit of helpful information - but, not much!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the book, I don't think the description was accurate. Not worth it to send it back."
4,Engaging Read!,"I have read thousands of romance, medieval and historical novels over the years and particularly enjoy those set in the Scottish Highlands. This was a fast paced story with strong, well developed characters. I enjoyed the dialog and interaction between the hero and heroine. I felt there could have been more difficult obstacles and decisions to be made that would have built tension in the story. The primary reason I could not give this book 5 stars is the sexual tension between Pagan and Dierdra and failure to consumate the marriage went on too long and did not ring true. Despite this small irritation, this was a fun read and I look forward to the stories involving the two sisters."
3,An Okay Read,"I was very excited to read this book and to see such good reviews I could not wait. I have to say while I LOVE reading stories about women being capable of handling a sword and taking care of themselves this was just beyond the norm. I felt like I was reading about two men for goodness sake. Diedre was just TO manly for my taste, so much so I've decided to by pass Hellenas book because she was worse. The third sister Meriums book I decided to purchase and hopefully will see just a little more softness to this sister. It's not a bad book but is not one of my favorites. If there had been a little more softness to this character I would have given this a five star."
2,I Really Wanted To Like It!,"The premise of a strong warrior type woman who can take care of herself and stand up for herself was wonderful. It started off good and there were humorous parts to the story as well.About midway through the story she gets to be just plain annoying. Even having sex is viewed as some kind of a control issue. You're a grown woman for crying out loud - really! You have to know when to stop the silliness and move on. Speaking of sex, there just wasn't any heat/sizzle to the story. (Maybe I was so annoyed by her, I missed it but I don't think so).This shoul've been such a good read. Sorry to say I was disappointed.Sheila"
4,"Well-written, interesting, good plot","A skillfully crafted novel from an accomplished writer, Phase One After Zero takes the reader on a fascinating fictional journey with Greg MacPherson. Starting with the bombing of the city hall in an Oklahoma town the story is loosely based on the idea of what might have happed if Timothy McVeigh had escaped and joined the Al-Qaeda. In this story Greg MacPherson escapes to Canada and then moves to the Middle East. Joining Al-Qaeda he becomes involved in the terrorist activities and the planning of the attacks of September 11. But, when it comes time for the attack he has some second thoughts. With well-defined characters and a writing style that is fast-paced but choppy at times it examines the problem of evil fighting evil as well as how a single event can dramatically change history. A good read for people who like suspense novels Phase One After Zero is a recommended read."
1,Don't waste your money.,I have never before seen such a worthless repair manual. It has cost me valuable time on more than one occassion when I have attempted to find parts that didn't exist or were in the wrong location. The authors apparenlty never checked to see the differences in corollas between 88 and 97. I promise you that if you own a 93 corolla (as I do) this manual will provide you with more frustration than guidance.
3,Helpful for the price,"I own both the Haynes and the Chilton books. I need one to fill in the blanks left by the other. If I had to use just one, it would probably be the Haynes. The Chilton would still be fine for most shadetree work. Neither have complete or even adequate wiring diagrams or in-depth info for transmissions,A/C,or troubleshooting. Haynes has the best photos and Chilton has an excellent write-up on vehicle emissions."
5,Chilton Auto Repair Book Series- (Toyota 1988-?),"As always, if you select the correct volume, you will be very satisfied.Chilton is among the top two auto service and repair publishers.Be sure to visit your library and research the exact book you need, and give left-over volumes to your regional library."
1,This book is the saboteur; the single biggest obstacle,"The fastener torque specs for Ft*lbs and N*M are transposed in a few places; as a result I over-tightened the engine mount through-bolts. Incomplete sentences, phrases and thoughts, and omitted steps are peppered throughout this rag. I haven't any confidence in what I am reading and have to spend several hours prior to doing the work simply verifying the info, or deducing if and where there are missing steps. This book is a failure."
3,great product but fragile,"I have purchased four of these and they are perfect for water lounging. But I only have two left because they rip at the seat seam. ONe ripped the first time we used it. If they made them more durable, they would be the ultimate. But if you consider that they only last one or two times, the cost is pretty high."
2,enjoy it will it lasts!!,"like everyone is saying it is crap but if you take care of it and don't let the kids on it, it will last you longer...it is nice to sit and float and still stay cool in the water...overall worth the money but after awhile the seat ripped off....(my kids jumping on it didn't help).....i may have to spend a few dollars more to get one where the seat will not rip off!"
1,"Great idea, but it tore the 1st time we used it","Great price. Looked fun for the pool, but the seat tore from the upper ring the very 1st time we used it."
1,Not worth the money,"I loved the chair, unfortunately the seat part rips off after about two weeks. I bought two of these, and they both ripped at the same time within two weeks! Very disappointed."
3,Cant get air into the seat,"Air went into the ring no problems, cant get air into the seat no matter what, none of the ""pump"" nipples will put air in the seat, almost like its blocked somehow."
2,Awesome Design......Poor durability,"This is the hands down most comfortable float out there. More comfortable than my $90 pool lounger....We loved them somuch after we bought 1, we went out and hunted down 3 more. In less than one month ALL 4 floats broke. Like everyone else, the seats on our floats broke away. These were only used by adults and were not treated roughly. Id pay triple the price for this item if it would not break."
2,seams didn't hold up,i purchased two of these last summer and they both tore at the seams after little use. The seats tore away from the arms.
2,Love and Hate,"I love this floaty - its comfortable, relaxing and easy to blow up.I hate this floaty - it has some sharp seams, and the seat tore on the 2nd weekend of using it by adults."
3,"Great design, but does not last",I wish someone would make the exact same design with better quality. We had so much fun with these but they did not last a month. The seat separates from the back.
1,"Might last a day, might last a week, but won't last a month","Pro: Comfortable, hold air well, nice beverage holders (if so equipped)Con: See titleBottom line: Recommend keeping your receipt so you can exchange for new ones on a regular basis. I won't buy another one.Loads of fun! No matter the size of the person or amount of air in the seat, you can depend on the Intex Sit N Float inflatable chair to tear at the seam attaching the seat to the arm. Entertain your friends by betting when and on whom it will fail. Someone will win because - sooner or later - they ALL fail. We went through six or eight of them over the course of a couple months this past summer. I finally ended up cutting the seats away from the shredded arm portions and using them as independent floats."
4,Sit and Float pool chairs,"We took the chairs down to Cancun. Could have sold a bunch of them to people at the pool. Everyone loved them. Very stable in the water, especially when you are visiting the swim-up bar. These chairs are especially nice because they have cup-holders in the arm-rest. You just sit back and float or get pushed around by your cabana boy(spouse)."
1,Will Break,The idea of this Float was great but it only lasted one day. The part that you sit on puts apart. I liked the float and went back to target and purchased another one and to my disappointment It busted again in the same spot. They are made to look like it would be for a big person and we are not big people and still busted them. Beware!
1,Junk,"Save your money, it only last 2 days and thats with a kid sitting on it. The part of the float that you sit on falls off."
4,We had so much fun with these. One broke the first day and all we had done was sit on it in the pool.,"We loved these floats. We blew them up without the use of a pump and it took no effort at all. Theye very comfortable, however, one broke the first day we had it after one use (of just sitting) in the pool. Other than that they were very relaxing!!"
2,Floatie,I am disappointed in this product. My 12 year old granddaughter climbed into it while it was in the water and the leg support portion of the floatie completely separated from the body of the float. This was its first use.
4,The seat broke away from the float in no time,"I loved this when I got it, but it wasn't long the seat broke awayfrom the back, just on one side, but it was great while it lasted."
3,busted float,"Floats were great at first. Easy to use. Not so durable. One has already broke. The side of the seat tore away from the back. Did not deflate, but still cannot sit on it to float."
3,I wanted to like it...,"I sent mine back for a refund. I was enjoying the float, reading, lounging, loving my vacation all the more with the fun float I took along to our cabin. All of a sudden I heard loud noise and felt bubbles popping all about me... a tear in the seat portion that was connected to the back. I wish I could find out if this was just a freak float because it was very comfortable and we all enjoyed it. I planned on order 3 more when I returned from vacation until this happened. :("
3,FLOATY,"THE PRODUCT IS GOOD AND THE SELLER IS VERY HELPFULL, THE ONLY THING I WISH I COULD HAVE CHOSE MY OWN COLOR INSTEAD OF SETTLING FOR THE RANDOM COLOR THEY SEND YOU, BUT ITS ALL GOOD !"
1,terrible,The seat rips from the edge of the float. Do not buy this product. 1 lasted less than 3 minutes & the other lasted less than 3 hours.
1,Poor engineering,"IT's just a damned shame these are so poorly designed, becuase everyone who sat in one (however briefly before they broke) loved them.The seat just is not enginneered properly to hold up and most all of ours (we bought four) broke within a week. My wife used her and it broke (she weighs 112 pounds)..I didnt even try to put my lard butt in one for fear of overstressing it.It doesnt seem to matter. they will tear quickly. LOw priced, but not even worth that price. what a shame!!!!!I do not recommend any one buy one of these..even if the price is $2.00...it's a waste of money."
4,Beware - you don't get color choice!,"I like these chairs and ordered 3. Yes, the seat rips, it's cheap. However, when they say colors will vary beware. I have a house full of boys and they sent me 2 pinks. They should really either let us pick colors or be sure they only send one of each color! I would have been fine with one pink, but two?? If anyone got green or blue and wants to trade please let me know! I'll keep one pink in the box."
1,Not a Great Product,"I have purchased three of these lounge chairs and two are broken after only a couple of uses. The seat ripped away from the chair along one side. In fact, they became ""adult only"" lounge chairs to avoid kid abuse, but even then one broke. They are perfect for relaxing, but they do not last!"
3,Wish it lasted longer,"Don't often offer my opinion, however had to share that like others that commented that the chair didn't last long, mine didn't either. The seat tears at he connection to the back. Lasted less than a month. Too bad, it was fun while it lasted."
3,A bit flimsey,I bought 4 tubes to take to Aruba for a lazy river pool. The first 2 that I inflated broke quickly however with a steady hand and TLC the other two tubes survived the week.
2,Didn't last long,"These pool chairs were nice at first but didn't last but about a month. I think had we kept them better inflated, they might not have popped in the end."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this product in a local store, not on Amazon. It is not at all as easy to use nor is it as boyant as one would think. The material is fairly durable, but then it was only used twice and then tossed in the garbage so for all I know it could rip after a couple of uses. I found it to be useless. It was a waist of my money."
2,not durable.....,"okay, it's cheap. and so i got what it's worth. it lasted only few hours. but we sure did have fun till the seat connecting to the arm gave way."
3,fun to use,Fun to use on recent trip to Marriott Aruba Surf Club. I wish it was more durable. It only lasted 2 days!
2,Broken after 2 hours,"I should have listened to the other reviewers. This float is great while it lasts. I bought 2 of them, and the one that I haven't used is still fine, but I sat on one for 2 hours in the pool and the seat is completely torn off of one side. I'm going to try to repair it, as it's just the connecting seam, and yeah, they are only $11, but still.....2 hours! It's too bad, as they are perfect for sitting and relaxing - hopefully I can fix it with some Gorilla Glue or something and get a few more uses out of it, but I wouldn't buy again."
2,Great while it lasted!,"We have bought 3 of these floats and loved them. However the seat rips away very fast which makes them useless. The first two we bought lasted about 2 to 3 weeks that last one only a week. We are not ""rough-housing"" on them as we are adults and only wanted them to lounge and float in the pool. They are easy to get into and out of and are very comfortable.Only reason we bought 3 is that they were much cheaper then most floating chairs."
3,Lazy River Fun,"This is our favorite floatation toy for floating in a lazy river, but the seats tear away from the back after a few uses."
2,Didn't last long,"After reading the reviews, I took the advice of others and put duct tape on the seams where the seat and the body of the chair meet. It didn't help. One of the seams ripped the first day we used it anyway. And the seat didn't hold air. I'm not too disappointed because I didn't think the float was all that comfortable anyway. Glad it didn't cost more than it did."
2,Not much plot to get in the way of the story,"I've just finished the second of this series and I'm probably going to skip #3 even though I've already got it. There is no plot to these books, just an endless series of events. The characters are introduced at a mind numbing pace and seem to be brough in only to maintain the supply of corpses. Each death is more bizzare and pointless than the last. Sexual encounters are equally random and pointless. One character loses the love of his life and manages to overcome his grief only through a sadomastochistic threeway with an Empress and her lackey. The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is the detailed descriptions of circus life in the 19th century. A non-fiction book would have made better use of Jenning's legendary research. In fact, you could go through this with a pair of scissors and cut out the ""story"" and probably end up with a reasonable facimile of the author's notebook."
3,Could have been great...,"This was an alright documentary... well made and somewhat entertaining; but nothing beyond that.Initially seeing how debate works and getting to witness some events is very interesting, but the novelty wore off pretty quick for me and the kids chronicled just couldn't sustain my interest like I would have hoped. Of course it doesn't help that for most of the movie they are speaking at an ungodly speed to the point where most of the time you can't understand what they're saying. There are bright spots here for sure, and moments of clarity that I really enjoyed; but as a whole film I simply 'liked it', and couldn't bring myself to enjoy it any more than a three star rating would suggest. Resolved, if you are looking for a great film about speech and debate go with 'Rocket Science' instead, even though it's a fictional film it has way more heart."
3,Satisfied,The pants are confortable but dont expect then to protect you from really heavy falls. The padding its a little soft and doesnt really offer you much protection against well anything. Overall really confortable to wear.
4,This cd has a few covers,Angel which was originally done by Jessica Simpson was a great cover by Diana She brought a great feel to this already good song
3,Te voy a mostrar,It's a good example of contemporary mexican pop music to play for my students of Spanish.
2,Stupid,"Much of the information in the book is repeated in other sections, so I feel like I am paying twice or three times for the same information. Also, a great deal of the questions on the ACSM exam cannot be found in this book.I have had four personal trainers in the past, and have exercised regularly for 15 years. I can tell you that a lot of what is in this book is not used by personal trainers. There is a lot of useless information.ACSM's Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription contains the same information as this book, just in a different order and sometimes with more technical language."
3,Could be improved...,"I agree that the information in the book tends to be redundant but I like it because it helps to drive in the important aspects of health and fitness. I do wish this book would go into more depth on the design of a program and different types of assessments besides push-ups, sit-ups, 1RM, and VO2max, BMI, etc. such as postural analysis of a client. Don't get me wrong though----This book is a must read for those who plan on becoming an ACSM Certified Personal Trainer! For those considering certification-I would suggest NASM or ACSM- two of the most reputable organizations in the health and fitness industry."
2,imaginary voyage,"this album moves in too many directions. it starts off sounding like country and then moves right into some mystic sounding, pieced together ""stuff"". and then around to something i couldn't even finish listening too. it would be better served if it had focus. ponty is great - but this doesn't show off what he does best and to me that is playing the violin! i don't believe it is as great as it is rated here. i unfortunately bought the cd based on these ratings and have been terribly disappointed. if i can, i'm going to get my $ back. unfortunately i cannot remember the first album i listened to by ponty, around 1985, and which sold me on him. i have been disappointed by the last TWO cd's i have bought. and i don't know if i'll keep trying to find it."
2,Decent movie,"The fighting was just kind of there early in this. It starts out introducing this guy as one of Wong Fei-Hung's famous students. From here on we get to know the bad guy. While really boring, this guy makes it worthwhile by hirign a couple of really tough guys to take out Wong Fei-Hung's student and his friends. He says that he will pay them $300 a month and will give them 3 months in advance. For one job? I guess the director was lettign us know he is rich. Anyways, one of the guys can REALLY kick and I think that I recognize him as Fong Yeh's son from 10 Magnificent Killers. Sadly he only has about 5 minutes of fighting time. The movie isn't really worth going over but Bruce Liang deals out some sweet kicks at the end. I was just glad that it had some decent kung fu, casue the first hour or so of the movie had none.Picture quality in the 50 pack this came in was ok."
3,Not what I expected,I was looking for something to replace a more expensive fixture I bought at Great Indoors. Fixture looks nice but has interchangeable handles which kind of cheapen the product and don't feel that sturdy. Also the shower is noisy when it runs. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Utterly disappointing,"This book is a real lightweight, suitable only for those with a complete ignorance of the tradition of the various branches of monotheism and who are happy with paraphrases of Swedenborg's work. Some of his work is quoted directly, but not much. Swedenborg himself is easy to understand, and there is no need for the condescending paraphrases of the author. His introduction, which takes up a good 20 percent of the book, is not needed for an understanding of Swedenborg and does nothing to provide a context for Swedenborg's work, which is highly original both historically and theologically speaking. I greatly regret having wasted my money on this book."
2,Didn't Do It For Me,"Visionary Selling didn't strike me as particularly visionary. Geraghty's precept is to sell to the ""C"" vision. This is simply a variant of ""Solution Selling"" where the problem is fulfilling the executive's vision. I expected more out of Geraghty's text than the repackaging of an established idea."
4,Here are all 12 of the songs!,1. THA INTRO2. SMOOTH BE THA NAME3. GET YOUR PRAIZE ON4. DON'T HATE THA FLOW5. ALL I REALLY WANT6. FRIEND OF MINE7. I CAME TO GET DOWN8. DREAMER9. NOW YA KNOW10. BRINGING THA HEAT11. THA GAME IS OVER12. GET YOUR PRAIZE ON (REMIX FEATURING THA WYZEMEN)
2,Did not fit a Mazda 929,"It did not fit my step-daughter's 1999 Mazda 929. It was a gift for her sweet 16. She still loved it, even though it wouldn't fit her first car. No problems with the seller. Very pleased with transaction."
4,Undisciplined Thought Par-Excellence,"Reading Serrres before this book was something of an adventure... You never know in advance quite what to get out of a reading of his work. Now, being able to flesh out all of the vaguenesses of his work with a general outline of this man's mind, I am more perplexed than ever. He comes across as very childlike in many respects and also very WEIRD. Seemed like Latour was humoring him in some parts as well. I admire Serres just as much having read this, if ony because he is stepping off onto a ledge in attempts to perhaps create something entirely (? ) original in the history of philosophical thought."
3,Ballet Christmas Carol,We collect Christmas Carol movies to show all through December at home so this was a nice change. It is a little different but we enjoy ballet so it was fun to see. Not one of my favorites but worth watching and owning.
3,"Interesting, But Not Enough","This book is filled with very remarkable biographies of fifty successful applicants and what they thought got them into Harvard. However, there is nothing brilliantly original about their strategies; the students followed standard procedures such as good essay writing skills, extracurricular activites, the norm. ""How They Got Into Harvard"" makes for a good read, but there is no real emotion in it."
2,"If you're not famous, It's not for you.","I normally am annoyed when people use the word 'elite' to describe the Ivy League. But this book makes it seem like everyone has to win an international competition or have a parent who writes for the NYT about education (as one person did), to get in. Many people interviewed in the book are from prominent families with parents Ivy League educated themselves. Unless your one of these people, and even if you are, this book is probably not for you. They need to write a book for everyday people with advice, not just information."
3,"Dog loved the edible bone, but didn't care much for the others","My dog loved the edible bone, but has ignored the others. However, the price was virtually the same as the edibles alone, so no real loss. Worth the gamble."
3,good product.,"for some reason, i have a hard time finding these nylabones petite sized in the stores. It was shipped fast and my dog just loves chewing on them. he is a 5 lb yorkie so it's perfect for his little mouth."
2,too pricey for the quality,"I bought this after reading several reviews. My Chihuahua finished the edible bone in 10 minutes, but then he didn't like to touch those two none edible ones. It was kind of waste of money."
3,MY Maltese doesn't like 2 out of 3,"He ignores two of these bones, and eats the edible one in under 5 minutes. That's less time than it takes him to finish a ""teenie"" Greenie. They may work for some dogs, but for mine, I will not order again."
4,My dog loves them!,I have a small dog that loves to chew so these were perfect for her. I especially love the blue one that is tecturized cause it keeps her biting the bone and not my arm :)
4,Edible is worthless but the chewable ones are good,I agree with everyone that the chewable bone being easy for them to chew quickly. My dog demolished it as I turned my back for less than 20 seconds. The rubber/plastic ones are great though. He has spent HOURS with them and loves them. Worth the money for those 2.
3,"Some good things, one bad.","I just bought this for my 7 year old maltese (she is a big malt at 11 lbs.) and my 8 month old pomeranian (he's 5 lbs.). The clear toy and the blue toy are okay, but that edible bacon flavored one was gone after five minutes of chewing. So fast that I was concerned the malt had perhaps swallowed it whole. They are going to the bathroom normally and acting fine, but that was just a little too scary for my tastes. I will also have to watch the blue one for little bits falling off. They do love them, so they would give it five paws, er four paws up."
5,Great chew toy!,my puppy loved these! she is an extreme chewer so they didn't last too long (I think she was on a mission to not stop until they were destroyed) but they lasted a lot longer than any other brand I have bought.
1,Are you kidding?,"It's a good bit of crafty fun, but where does someone come off selling it for $250 when it RETAILED for $9.95?!"
3,Ben carson: World Acclaimed Neurosurgeon (Review),"I must say I'm a Ben Carson fan. If you seen the movie about Dr. Carson it's hard to bet against him. Ben Carson is interviewed in this program and he talks about his profession, being a doctor and how hard it was as a child. This program is a must have just because its Ben Carson. I just love American history, Black history and any other type of history that will give me more knowledge to share with my students."
1,Don't know never received it,"I would love to say I liked it, but the company said they sent it, I never received it, so I can't say I liked it. Their word against ours and they will not do anything about it. Have had numerous communications with them and I am hitting a dead road, so I can't honestly say this purchase was a happy one."
2,Sterling silver loving family heart necklace,"I gave it as a gift but it was so tiny, I did feel a big embarrased to give it away. If I had more time I would have sent it back and tried for a larger pendant."
5,Beautiful!,Bought this for my mom and sister. Has a really nice durable chain and the charm is a perfect size. Came in a cute box also!
3,you get what you pay for,"The pendent is nice enough quality. Even though it was smaller than I expected, I should have read the measurements more carefully. So that's my fault for not realizing it would be so small. The chain the pendent came with tarnished in less than a week. Expect to use an alternate chain for this pendent if you buy."
2,Piece of junk,"Purchased for my wife for Valentine's day and the item is defective, not to mention cheap looking. The chain is not attached to the clasp - not broken, just purely a defective item. Unfortunately it adds more frustration that I am 1 month past the return window when I finally get around to doing something about it."
2,This item has gotten HIGHER AND HIGHER in PRICE!!!,"I have been wanting to purchase this over 3 years, but because of lack of money havent been able to. Originally, this was in the 20$ range and I thought, I can get one for me and my 2 sisters. Yeah right. For this price, now 40$. Im better off just drawing a picture because it will have the same effect. I am very dissapointed by this product because the price just keeps on getting higher and I am not going to spend 130 dollars or whatever for 3 of them. Just ridiculous. Thanks for UPING the price!"
3,Family necklace,"It looked nice in the picture...but when I received it, I was not impressed at all and know it would not be something my daughter would appreciate. It was way to small and just not what I know she would have wanted."
5,Lovlier than you think,"I purchased several of these necklaces as Mother's Day gifts this year. I must say that they are much lovlier than they appear online. They have a bit of sparkle to them that you can't tell from the picture or even when they are in the box. But the sparkle is quite noticeable when worn. Everyone loved their gifts, and I was happy that they were happy. The price is more than reasonable for such a beautiful gift. So, don't let the picture online fool you. These necklaces are beautiful."
4,I love this pendant!,This is a wonderful pendant. My husband gave it to me for Christmas and I haven't taken it off. It has held up great and I get tons of complements on it! It's the perfect size and reminds me daily of my family. I love it!
4,Nice pendent,"I have bought three of these as gifts. They are beautiful pendents, the chain is mid-line ... what you would expect for the price. They make a perfect ""Thanks for my new grandbaby gift!"" :)"
1,Not as described,"I had originally bought this item and gave it a glowing review... That was until discovering that the pendant although labeled as being sterling silver isn't actually sterling silver. See my added product image to see it failing the simple magnet test. Silver is non magnetic, pendant is supposed to be 92.5% silver 7.5% some other metal usually copper which is also non magnetic. Pendant is being misrepresented in my opinion as silver when it is not."
3,Nice Pendant,This pendant is nice but the description did not include the white in lay. For the money I thought it was over priced.
5,christmas present,"the necklace was gorgeous, i bought it for my mom for christmas and she loved it. would recommend this everyone."
3,a good read that could have been great,this was a good read but it glossed over things that i felt were important. it really could have been a great book. the ending was very exciting. i would have liked to have known kevel better. he seemed important to the story. i would try another book by this author.
4,A very useful guide,"This was the first Rough Guide I bought for the first of my solovacations. I chose it after comparing with various other guides,such as the Blue Guide and others. This provided an immenseamount of detail on all sorts of historical sites, little towns,etc. and was of great value in planning out my trip. One thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that I later discovered that there are a number of ""dark age"" monuments (forts, inscribed stones, gravesites, etc.) that it doesn't list; it concentrates on larger places. I would have liked to have seen alot of those, as dark age Britain is an interest of mine. To be fair, other guides leave those things out, too, and I had to find the info in archeological and historical references."
4,"Very academic, but well worth reading","In ""Changes of Mind"", Jenny Wade provides the reader with an excellent survey of research regarding stages of consciousness, from prenatal to after-death. Perhaps because she is working principally with academic research, her writing style is likewise very academic. Those not accustomed to the jargon of the field intially may find the writing style somewhat dry and less accessible; however, the content is very directly and lucidly presented. Wade presents differing opinions developed from research done in the field and carefully brings together her theory regarding the evolution of consciousness. I found the chapter regarding pre- and perinatal consciousness to be particularly fascinating. Also very useful are the charts that Wade developed listing the characteristics of each level of consciousness. For anyone who wishes to understand research regarding transpersonal psychology and holonomic theories, this book is invaluable."
2,Where's the Value Here?,"I bought this book based upon the reviews and Dr. Wade's later book Transcendent Sex. I was looking for more good content from this writer, albeit this being an earlier book. Upon reading the book I found an academic book that had to, in the pendantic style required by American academia, slog through this and that research to get to a point that I did not find revolutionary at all. Just another psychological theory that I didn't see much usefulness or relevance to the real world where we need less academic theories and more practical techniques and paths. I don't even remember exactly what the ""revolutionary"" part of her theory is supposed to be. I sold the book and hopefully someone will get more out of it than I did. I don't think that this book lives up to the reviews at all. Just in case I'm wrong, how about someone posting a review and getting to the point of this ""revolutionary theory"" and telling us what it is and how it's supposed to help us all in life?"
5,Super step stool,I am a short grandma and I love this step to reach my cupboards. Light weight and easy to store.
2,perfect but...,product is really perfect but there is a problem with its box.They send me in am box which ia too small for that glasses.The glasses is the same with the picture but the cover is not.It was so nonsense I couldn't get anything from it.Except these the product is gorgeous!
1,why,thats what i have been asking myself why did i buy this dvd? i will be giving this away asap to anyone that wants it.
4,"Arnold, America, Ambition","I was intrigued to read this book when I learned the biographer was prevented from appearing on ABC's Good Morning America by Arnold's publicist, the all powerful Pat Kingsley. It is a well researched and written book with no agenda. I held back a star because his journey to America was fascinating and the hunt is more exciting than the kill. It made me respect him more what sacrifices he made to come to this country and I pass no judgement about being a ""boy toy"" to a septegerian Spanish prince as a means to get out of Austria. Even it was only posing, and no touching. He used whatever he had to get to America. He has nothing to be ashamed of and his children will know if he did not do what he did they would not be here to judge him. It was a big mistake to kill this book it will one day idemnify him as a dreamer who took action."
3,Is this the real Arnold's Life?,"I'm a big arnold fan, so you know where Istand on the subject. I've read all his books""The education of a bodybuilder"" ect. WhenI read this book I thought all the facts arehere about Arnold's life ,whats wrong?This book trys to give an investigativereporter angle. It gives us the dingylook at Arnold's life, on such topics assexuality, steriod use, and even racism!Look, I don't know if any of these topicscovered are true or not. After all thisis the unauthorized bio of the Austrian Oak'slife. To sum it up this book tries tobring to light the dark side of Arnold'slife. If thats your cup of tea ,then read thisbook!..."
4,Chestnut's Drunk Album,"I've been a fan of Vic Chestnut for many years, yet I'm just now obtaining his early work. "" Drunk"", is one of those early endeavors and I was pleased to find that it was classic Chestnut with comical, depressing, outspoken and introverted songs. Chestnut is an American original from the South and I recommend any of his albums. This is not his best, but it's a fine one none the less."
5,Very Nice,I truly is a 5 stars worthy skirt. Stylish and well tailored. A huge bargain at amazon's price. Cannot find a Jones NY skirt like this at a department store for this price even during off-season sales.
4,percussionist's delight,"People who like listening to percussion will adore this CD, but that's not the end of its appeal. Scott Plouf's drumming is skillful, clever, at times ingenious, and above all sounds nothing like what you hear elsewhere. It contributes strongly to every song without overbearing.Much the same can be said for Rebecca Gates' lyrics. Like any good poet, she leads us down a path only to introduce the unexpected. The poetry is never sacrificed for meter or melody -- these are expressions of thought and feeling, not pop songs.Perhaps it is an album that was never destined for huge sales, but I like to think its pleasures run deeper. I think it's great."
5,love this seat,"I love this Eddie Bauer carseat. I bought one for the three year old when she turned one, and she's still in it. I just bought this one for my newly turned one year old and again, it's a great seat. I love these seats, they're durable, comfortable and safe."
2,REAR FACING - NOT!,"Ok, so we bought this seat for our 3rd son when he was close to one year old. We never used it rear facing with him. Now that son #4 has come along (a 22 pound 6 month old) we are in desperate need to get him into a new seat. I got this seat out of garage and attempted to install it. Well today was last and final attempt to get this thing not to move around once ""secured"". I QUIT! It will not fit into my Mercury Monterey bucket seats no matter how hard I try. The back of the seat flops around way too much. There is NOTHING to anchor it from slamming forward making him hit to back of the seat.So I will be going out and purchasing the Wizard from Britax, it may be pricy, but at least the tether on that one will keep the seat in place!We have purchased many seats in our days and I would recommend this one for forward facing, but that is it."
1,CAREFUL about little fingers,"San Francisco Fire Dept and Paramedics had to cut the index finger loose from baby's (18 months) car seat--there is a hold under the padding on the armrest--the perfect size for a baby/toddler to explore...frotunately, just banged up and bruised but did return seat and report problem to NHTSA, manufacturer and Eddie Bauer--put duct tape over as a temporary fix in a friend's child's seat..."
4,We bought 2!,"My 8 and 1/2 month old and I live with my mom so I can go to college while still taking care of my son, and we just bought 2 of these car seats because we use both cars equally when driving with my son. I was excited about this seat because of its snug fit in my Jeep since we could never manage to get the infant seat as snug as we would've liked. I do agree with the other reviews about the difficulty with instaling it to be rear-facing, we just have them forward facing in both cars. Also, it has the recline feature, but we haven't been able to use it because if we did it would readjust the seat making it loose. So unless the seat is rear facing I'm not sure that it's really any use. Luckily though, he is very happy in his car seat and yes, his chin touches his chest when he sleeps, but that was the issue in the infant seats as well. We're happy with the car seats and it was better than spending the $290 on just one of the Britax convertible car seats."
4,Dated anime but Awesome story!!,Wow the story behind this was way past kewl. The characters were intruiging. Especially the realtionship between Babel II and the leader of the bad guys. Quite kewl. There were only two things that were off with this anime. First the animation is dated. You can tell that this anime was made a while ago. The images are slightly blurry with stock images being used over and over. Also the way the story went made it seem more of a complete tv series turned into a quick movie. There seemed to be missing time gaps that we never saw. Scenes change at the drop of hat with no explanation. Aside from this the anime was great! I had lots of fun viewing this one though! Reminded me a lot like Mai the Psychic Girl^_^
3,Breath of fresh air?,"Most Anime seen in the United States will eventually leave you cold with it's half naked babes and overly innocent teenage male stars but for once that has changed. In this fantasy tale we find the young male hero to still be very much the innocent at first but over time he becomes the wiser then his age superhuman hero that we all know he's going to be. With a plot that sometimes seems to turn back in on itself this particular anime can confuse some newer viewers of Japanese Anime. Then again, with it's odd plot progression and sometimes disconcerting visual images, maybe we could all get a little confused. Either way this isn't a bad movie, just a little out of date."
5,Great Little Ring,"I bought this spinner ring for my daughter who picks at her nails. Now, instead of picking at her nails, she spins her ring - most of the time! While it is nothing fancy, it a nice little ring. She wears it all the time, even in the shower. It still looks like the day we bought it!"
4,Fascinating,"This book is actually a two fold survey into the study of alchemy and how it's symbols are recurrent throughout history. The idea that these symbols are universally produced and represented in our dreams and in our art was fascinating. Jung does not advocate going out and trying to change lead into gold but rather tries to understand these symbols as they relate to the development of the psyche. The first part of the text relates to one case study in particular; that of physicist Wolfgang Pauli. The second part is an expose into the genesis of certain symbols in the context of Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity to name a few. Highly recommended but slow at times."
2,A poorly organized book about a fascinating topic,"Psychology and Alchemy has a lot of interesting information, but it is not presented in any sort of organized fashion. Alchemy is well known for its perplexing symbols, but in the book these symbols are only referred to in passing. This book is not for anyone who is trying to understand how the symbolism of Alchemy relates to psychology. The descriptions of basic elements such as the planets, the caduceus, or birds are only 1-2 sentences in length and are scattered throughout the book. Trying to use the index won't help either, as the pages listed in the index as containing information about a topic are often incorrect as they contain no mention of the topic being looked up."
4,Jung THE man of THE psych,"Jung is à master of his time , try to explain many things that are not visible, but THE poepje who study jung are more intrestet in his method instead of what THE man say,s.This book is for THE magir that whqnt to have inside in his symboliek power , and jung is giving it to you.Excellent book ."
5,Excellent book,Great book of a great thinker. It would be better if the year of the reprint was displayed at the moment of the purchase.
3,"beautiful work, but not historical","Jung has an exciting, compelling account of how to interpret alchemy in the light of his psychology, but is wrong when he tries to reduce alchemy to Jungian Psychology. for a good treatment of the problems with Jung's view, which is rooted in bad 19th century occult interpretations of alchemy, seeLawrence M. Principe and William R. Newman, ""Some Problems in the Historiography of Alchemy,"" in William R. Newman and Anthony Grafton (eds.), The Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy in Early Modern Europe"
3,Not For The Detail-Seeking Hobbyist,"This is mostly a history of James Hill and the Great Northern Railroad. If someone is trying to build an accurate model of the passenger train the Empire Builder or the Great Northern Railroad they won't find the information they need here. There is little information about the trains themselves, the facilities, or the equipment they used. There's a lot more background information than I've seen in other books, and more history of the business side of GN than in other books."
3,Sometimes uncomfortable...,"The frank portrayal of Simon's relationship with her father in this book is refreshing, as are many of the stories about daily life as a girl growing up Jewish in the Bronx after WWI. However, the parts dealing with sexual advances of older man and, in general, older people's sexual opportunism with younger people were things I found really disturbing. Simon tells these anecdotes well and evenly, but as a reader, I felt frustrated and helpless reading so much about the way the taboos of sexuality trapped kids into silence about their victimization."
1,Beware - It's only half what you need!,"I was disappointed to realize that this product does not include the power cord that leads to the wall outlet! I suppose the photo makes that apparent but I did not notice as this product was priced the same as others that do include the outlet cord. The description should make it clear that you will not receive the outlet cord. The shipper, SF Planet, has been very slow to respond to my request for a return authorization based on an ""e-mail only"" customer service system - still waiting.Update: Today I found a phone number for customer service on CNET and the nice lady said she would send me the missing part! If it arrives I will return to this review and give them a better report."
5,Canon charger,Once I received this product I was very pleased with it and have found it to be very handy for all my picture needs.Ron Jones
4,Just as same as original parts came with my Canon,"It worked just fine, though model number is slightly different. Charges battery farely quickly and no issue operating with AC. Original one only last three years but hope this one to stay longer."
1,a piece of crap,"I ordered it on July 26. I used it once, maybe twice since and now it's broken. The return window expided 10 days ago. A piece of crap."
5,compact power adapter for Camcorder,The compact power adapter for Camcorder that we had ordered was in excellent condition and as described.Thanks
1,Don't bother - get your saddlefitting information for free!,I returned this book because I was so disappointed in it. The diagrams are childlike drawings (close to useless) and the text is limited to the bare essentials of saddle-fitting.There are better guides to saddlefitting available for free on the web!
5,Great buy,"This watch is very light weight, I purchased it for a friends husband and he is very happy with it. It is very fashionable and can be worn with variety of attires. Good choice for a budget and with quality coming with it."
3,Mixed review,"I am satisfied with the purchase, but it looked better on line than in person. The gold in the armband isn't as distinct as it appears on line. Otherwise it's a decent watch for a decent price."
5,Sized for tiny cameras and similar gadgets...,"Tamrac Neo's Digital 5 Slim Digital Camera BagThis tough case is the perfect size for tiny cameras such as the Olympus Stylus 7010. About the largest thing that will fit in the pouch would be: 2 3/8"" wide, 3/4"" - 1"" deep, and 4.5"" tall. The case will stretch somewhat, so measurements don't have to be precise.The front cover secures with Velcro and the case is lightly padded for protection of the contents. There's a small ""pocket"" just under the front flap, large enough for a compact-flash, SD, other memory card, or similar item. The case has two hooks for attaching to a neck strap. The belt loop on the back of the case will wrap around a belt up to about 2"". This case w/camera is only slightly larger than my tiny cell-phone case; i.e., hardly notice I'm carrying it. Nice product."
2,"Outdated, but could be helpful to the complete idiots","You gotta remember that this book was written in 2000, right around the time the dotcom bubble burst. Of course you didn't have to be amazon or ebay to survive the bloodbath, as many small independent shopping sites have been doing quite well.This book doesn't tell you how to come up with a good idea -- I doubt anyone can really tell you, since successful entrepreneurship is seeded totally on individual creativity. (Disclosure: I myself am still trying to come up with the mother of all ""how come I didn't think of that"" ideas.) It's more about how to set up an e-commerce site, but the information is already outdated now that four years have passed. Still, it could be an informative read if you are truly clueless about e-commerce."
1,Bridge for Sale,Is this Rod Underhill related to Roy Underhill? I see they're credited together for writing quite a few books together. Even if I was married to this guy his book isn't very good. Maybe he should stick to woodworking.
5,Review of Nothing,"I thought I wanted something but now that I think about it, I really want nothing. Once I confirm that this is fragrance-free, pesticide-free, dye-free, and fabric-free, I will place my order. I want for nothing. I want this t-shirt."
5,Nothing for something.,Ive always had the mentality that I wanted something for nothing until I finally realized what I always wanted was nothing for something. All I have to say is nothing comes cheap! I was ecstatic when nothing arrived in the mail shortly after placing my order. Overall this is the best nothing I have ever bought. I would definitely buy nothing again sometime in the near future. Thanks for nothing.

1,"Worthless for JavaScript, HTML","Despite the multiple representations in this book's web page, summary, and in the references to it in this publisher's ""Domino Development in 21 Days"", this book has barely any coverage of JavaScript. This does not please a customer who ordered it based on its publisher's description and paid to have it airmailed to a foreign country. If you are looking to pick up the skills to transition from server development to web development, you will be extremely disappointed."
4,Good book for Notes Developers. Not for beginners.,"This books gives a head start development in R5 for already notes developers. I liked the casual language of authors. The book covers all the development aspects of R5 including Formula Language, Lotus Script, Java and JavaScript(it teaches you how to use JavaScript in Notes R5. You need to be familiar with it already). It also covers Lotus Components, Net Objects Bean Builder and Domino Global workbench. Not to forget the chapter on Project Design & Management aspects of Domino Applications. It is worth buying. The only problem is, the book is heavy and should have been hard cover bound. I am not sure i can have this book for too long. By the time i finish reading, the pages maybe separated from the book. Lots of useful trial software in CD. I liked the NetObjects Fusion."
4,"Great book, but some problems with the publisher...","The book provides a great overview of R5 development techniques. Unfortunately, it is deficient in its coverage of Javascript. This is due soley to the fact that the publisher left out two chapters submitted by the author (I recently spoke with her personally). The missing chapters are supposed to be available at the publisher's site, but the download link was broken when I last checked yesterday. Their customer service did not return emails about that either. It's really a shame, as the author is very experienced in using Javascript in Domino, and teaches the Lotus Education course on that subject. If you need an overall development in R5 book, I would still recommend this one, but if you are specifically interested in Javascript, it would be best to wait for a reprint, or at least for the publisher to get the missing chapters available for download."
1,For beginners only,"This book is supposed to be at a user level of Intermediate - Advanced. Quite the contrary. As a reference for experienced developers I found this book to be very disappointing. If you are relatively new to Notes this book could be of value, otherwise I believe your money can be better spent elsewhere."
1,Not practical for Business,"I've had this book at my desk at work for over a year now. I still have not found one pratical use for this book. Every time I ran into a question developing a Notes application this book has been no help. A lot of the applications used in my business rely on LotusScript which is very weakly covered in this book. My advice, go to lotus.com and get their manuals. You'll be better off."
2,What happened!!??,"This series was going so well, I don't understand what happened to this one. I didn't found it suspenceful nor interesting. The plot was weak.... I gave 2 stars only because the ending gave some really interesting info. ....Thank [goodness]that the next book (Book #11) was beyond cool and rewarding."
2,Worst in the series...,"This book is without a doubt the worst book in the Everworld series.The other two David-narrated books were really good, but all of a sudden this one just fell apart. Too many descriptions, not enough dialog, and the weakest plot of the series. The only good part of the book was his conversation with Brigid.I don't want to say skip this one, but you can probably get away with just skimming through it as I did and still be able to know what's going on."
5,Fast and Healthy,"One of the best collections of basic recipes I've found yet. Linda West Eckhardt has made an easy to follow cookbook that can be used on a day to day basis. I find myself going back to the recipes again and again, adding my family's flavor to some and keeping others just so. The ingredients are quick, easy to find and inexpensive. If you cook on a regular basis, or are tired of fast food for a busy family , this is a cookbook you need."
1,Lots of recipes to try at a low cost,"Didn't care for some of the recipes in the book. In one chapter, she takes God's name in vain which is why I rated it 1 star.This book gives advice on saving money such as cutting down on grocery costs and cooking from scratch. This is how the book is organized:IntroductionFish and ShellfishPasta and RicePoultryVegetarian EntreesRed MeatsBeansEggs and CheeseBreads and DesertsStocking a $10.00 a day kitchenFor each recipe, she tells you how much it costs per serving, how many people that recipe feeds and how long it takes to make that recipe.In the last chapter, it gives advice on what kind of herbs, seasonings, canned/dtied goods should be stocked in your pantry and refrigerated goods. The book also includes recipes for condiments, flavorings, herbs, leavening extracts, sweeteners, thickeners and milk & cream."
3,"It's called ""programming.""","To the reviewer who wrote 'how dare they compare a...faker with a genius?'They dare.It's called ""programming.""In music, that means bringing together works that illuminate each other in interesting ways.It doesn't mean the works are of identical value, merely enlightening when encountered side by side.And BTW: the simple fact of recording a piece of music and distributing it is not some rare honor. It does not imply that the musical work is that of a ""genius"" or anywhere near there.It implies a strategic decision that some people might find that work interesting or valuable or enjoyable--in any number of ways, along any number of axes.We listen to music to be amused, to pass the time, to admire it, to delight in it, to be moved by it, etc.It is possible to appreciate all these purposes--when we open our minds just a bit.--E. R. O'Neill"
4,"Dermatologists say its a good cleanser, but it was not gentle enough for my sensitive skin","If you have problematic skin (rosacea, seb derm, etc etc.) try Aveeno's ""Positively Radiant"" cleanser instead. I can use the Aveeno product twice a day without my skin feeling stripped, and with a washcloth it will get my eye makeup off as well (without stinging my eyes.)"
3,OK,"I can't tell if it is working or not... but the reason I gave it a three stars is because, when it arrived damaged twice. It leak inside the bag. I sent back the first one thinking maybe it was a process wrong but second one came just like the first one...I will probably not order this again."
3,Good cleanser,"This is a very mild cleanser. However, it was not packed very well and the contents of one bottle drained about a quarter of the bottle."
5,Another Gary Jennings winner!,Haven't read a Gary Jennings book I didn't like and Spangle was the same. I originally read it as one book and now have it split into the trilogy. Jennings does an amazing job making you think you are there.
5,Antigone,Excellent for high school students armed with a viewing guide assignment. It beats getting a dvd copy from the library throughout each semester!
4,Well-acted performance of Anouilh's play,"The debate between Creon and Antigone is intense and makes up for the poor video quality. Note to teachers, this is worth showing to classes who are reading the Sophocles play, though the differences are more useful than the similarities--especially the role of the chorus."
1,"Watch the real ""Antigoni"" (1961) Irene Papas","As with many experiments in extracting classics and trying to adapt them to modern day you lose everything but the words and in this case those also. This was a horrible attempt to portray the story that has no relevance in the context of modern architecture and tuxedo. There is a lot more Jean Anouilh and very little Sophocles.If I did not know better I would say this is a project for out of work actors. I did notice that Geneviève Bujold would probably make a good Ophélie in a classic Hamlet. Not much good could be said from the half hearted narration it just goes down hill.It takes a while to get the bad taste out of your mouth. Clear your pallet with the Greek version that is much better portrayed by Irene Papas. Irene also did a superb port rail of ""Elektra"" (1961).Antigone"
1,No good for tenth grade class,"While this may be an artistic triumph for the actors, it is worthless as a teaching tool. My tenth graders were bored and didn't understand much of what was going on even though we had read and discussed the play in class. Most of them went to sleep, that is the ones who were not talking and ignoring the video. This purchase was money wasted by me."
2,"Not bad, but less a carerr guide than expected...","This book lists itself as a carrer guide, which it is to a point. Some of the best portions of this rather thin book are the portions where a ""day in the life of x"" is explained and listed on a timeline type of thing. These sections give good insite into what it is to be an associate (post MBA) at several firms. However, there are only a couple pages of this. A majority of the book is very basic what is investment management. There is a subtle difference between what is IM and what does someone working in IM do? There is too much explanation of ""in a bull market stocks go up"" and ""mutual funds invest in a bunch of stocks"". Vault should focus on the career aspect more. They do have some interview questions that are good, but this could easily have been 1/2 the length and 1/4 the price and still had the same impact."
5,A must-read,This book gives not only a realistic overview of the Investment Management business but it also provides great tips about companies and interviewing strategies.I especially liked the section that outlined a day in the life of someone in the investment management business. It gives a great picture of what to expect and how to get into the business.It is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn about the business or for anyone in the business who wants to get information about other companies.
4,Note from the Author!,"I initially wrote this book for family and friends and while a good story, I had no idea it would make the best selling list! Sorry for all the errors (I could have used an editor), and on page 261, the first line of the second full paragraph should be moved down to the third line from the bottom...the many monsters, etc.I am currently writing the second book and trying to nail down an agent as well as a larger publishing company...be patient, its coming!Thanks again for your support--Cheiron"
5,Perfect for the G15,"Bought this to replace the standard neck strap that came with my G15 camera. This strap is great and seems to be a perfect fit with the camera. As a couple of other reviewers have stated you can not 'cinch' the wrist strap around your arm, which would be nice, although for me I do not feel like there is a risk of it falling off while walking around due to the material inside the strap and the width of it."
5,Very Sturdy.,Suitable for large cameras. But a little too big for my Canon g15 camera. Too much strap to fit into small camera case.
4,"Great item, but NOT for the G9","This is a great item, if the openings on the camera had been just a tad wider, I would have kept it. I did not know that Canon widened the eyelets in the G10/11/12. It was impossible to push this strap through without destroying it in the process, so it is going back. Boo hoo. :-)"
4,Works well for micro-4/3rds,"This is a very simple item, but it works well for my intended purpose. I bought it to use with my Olympus E-P3. It offers security while holding the camera away from your body without the extra bulk of a neck strap. It would be nice if the wrist strap was adjustable in size, but it works pretty well for my larger hands. The wide fabric used for the wrist strap is comfortable. The attachment loop is securely sewn to the wrist strap and there are no metal parts to scratch the finish on your camera. This is a good choice for micro-4/3rds shooters."
5,Tight fit on Canon G15 powershot,"I bought this wrist strap hoping it would fit the G15 powershot model, but it barely slid on. The fit was very tight (half inch wide) and it looked awkward on the camera. Also, the wrist strap itself is 1.25"" wide and you can't adjust the length, so it feels bulky and it can easily slip off if you have small wrists. Even though it wasn't what I was hoping for, it is a good quality strap. The material feels durable and the fabric is not stiff.I will give the product 5 stars because the strap is well made.If anyone can recommend a durable camera wrist strap that fits the canon g15 model, please leave a comment. Thanks."
5,Now This Is A Wrist Strap!,"I hate neck straps so I needed a good wrist strap for my new G12. I chose wisely! This strap rocks! I don't worry about dropping my camera as this is the sturdiest wrist strap I've ever seen. Kudos to Canon for a fantastic alternative to the conventional neck strap. If you prefer a wrist strap then this is for you. Not just for camcorders, great for digital cameras as well."
3,There's just one thing I do not like....,"In every movie they list, the plot from beginning to end is given away. I just didn't really like knowing what exactly happenend at the end of Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia or any other movie I might rent after viewing this book. No complaints otherwise."
4,Sharp G-Shock - Metal Band,"I had my first G-Shock for 8 years, put 3 new bands on it over the course of the years. Finally the rubber around the bezel just gave in and dry-rotted. I renovated a house while wearing this watch full time. I am really hard on a watch with all the construction I do on the side. I loved that G-Shock so this time I went with this one which is of metal construction. It is a solid watch and I really like it except for one thing, the black on the band links under my wrist has been rubbing off which is dissappointed but no one can really see that."
5,Casio G-SHOCK,I am in a ruff and tumble type job. I need a robust watch that i can rely on and trust. This watch has been a cracker so far. Has some useful features. Hope to have it on my wrist in ten years time.
3,Casio Men's G shock watch,"Watch is not as good as I thought from reviews. Black rubbed off bracelet in several spots within 2 weeks. Also, watch inconsistently picks up time signal. Booklet that accompanies watch is way too small."
2,Did not last long,"I loved this watch for the first 3 years but it started shutting off because it needed to be charged. The problem continued to get worse until it was shutting off several times a day. I sent it in to have it fixed because I liked the watch so much but I was told it would cost $88.00 to fix it. It was a great watch but don't plan on it lasting more than about 3-5 years. From looking around online this is a common problem that I wish I would have known about prior to buying the watch. I would suggest one of the battery powered G-Shock watches over the solar models. Mostly I am mad at casio, $88.00 to fix a $120.00 watch kind of sucks."
3,Watch Band wear and tear,"i've had this watch for about 2 years now. i've found that the black paint or powdercoating or whatever it is on the metal band has started to wear off and the silver metal underneath is showing through. it almost looks like i took steel wool to it and polished the black off of the band in a lot of places. it's happening all around the band wherever it has made contact with a desk while typing or other similar activity. it's very disappointing because it has ruined the sleek and very classy look of this practical, tough watch. i love the watch itself except there's no countdown timer?!!?"
3,"Great watch, bad band.","I really wanted to like this watch but I had a problem with the band. It was really big. I must have tiny wrists but I had to remove most of the links and it was still either too loose or too tight. There was no comfortable middle ground. If they used smaller links, then maybe it would have fit better but...."
2,"I really like the Supersuckers, but...","...I can't dig the way they stole Thin Lizzy songs and passed them off as their own. There are a few songs on this album that are really Thin Lizzy songs from a lesser-known Thin Lizzy album called ""Renegade."""
3,A for Cleverness but C for Results,"I was looking for silicone tongs because I have found that nylon sometimes melts. Since I have other Oxo tongs I gave this one a try.When it arrived I thought, ""How cool, tongs and a spatula in one""...sort of like that gadget Grip-n-Flip advertised on late night TV but by a reputable manufacturer.Unfortunately, the silicone ""flippers"" do not grip very well. In fact, they get slippery with cooking oil. The tongs work fine in spatula mode for something you would turn from the bottom like a burger, but they are very poor in tong mode when handling food you turn from the side like sausages. The food slips out and spatters.Oxo should just make a silicone version of its nylon tongs."
5,Great tongs!,"These are designed as a hybrid between a spatula and tongs. I particularly like using these for cooking breakfast sausage in a skillet. I can use them as a spatula to loosen them from the pan and then as tongs to grab several at a time. I highly recommend them. The locking mechanism is very useful for storing them or locking them onto something that you are grabbing. the metal plate inside the silicone is very flexible (almost to a fault) and therefore is somewhat adjustable. We even use them at work to grab parts from a drying oven. The only thing I would suggest to OXO would be to make another exactly like this one, but with thicker metal plates inside the silicone to make it stiffer. This one and a stiffer one would both have uses in my kitchen."
4,Good in their own way.,"I had a similar pair of tongs, but they were coated with nylon and melted. I was very excited to find these - I'd actually looked on the Oxo site for something like this and didn't see them, because the picture doesn't do a good job of showing that they have a large surface area.These definitely have their downfalls in that they're not good for everything, but they are exactly what I want for delicate foods I cook often, like tofu and fish. They're also great for grabbing sausage and vegetables like asparagus and green beans. Another great use I've found is to sear meat, using the tongs to flip it over, then deglazing the pan for sauce and using the wide edges of the spatula to scrape up the flavorful bits. I wouldn't say this is a substitute for regular tongs, but it has its own uses."
2,disappointed,The first time I tried to use these tongs was to retrieve lasagna noodles from a pot of boiling water. I quickly gave up as they kept slipping out of the tongs. I knew they might be a little slippery from reading other reviews but this was just silly. The ends flex too much when trying to pick things up. My wife has used them more like a spatula and she is sure she can use them for things like flipping over fish etc. I would not recommend them or buy them again. The strips along the handles work very well to prevent the tongs from sliding around in your hands when they are wet or covered with oil. I bought the nylon covered tongs and they work great.
1,They don't pick anything up!,"I bought these to use with my new non-stick cookware. They are slippery and I can't pick anything up with them, didn't anyone test these before putting them on the market?"
4,Great refference book.,An excellent reference book on cape bulbs. A wealth of photo's and information. Aspects of the book are on the technical side for a layman. But worth having.Highly recomended.
3,Product is NOT white!,"Please note, the cord is extremely wide (about 3/4"") and fairly thick (1/4"").I did a search for ""white extension cords"" and this item came up; it was the right length, had 3 prongs, the picture was white, so I ordered it. However, it is GRAY. Wish I'd not trusted the search & pics; now I have to send it back. A GRAY cord should not pop up (with white pics) in a search for a WHITE cord!!"
5,Awsome - heavy duty- quality,"I just got it and I am impressed. It is heavy gauge and high quality. In a shorter cord, I do have some 10 gauge yellow jackets, this is the best I have ever seen. It is great. I see no need to lit duty cords. This is just what I had in mind.. Buy it!"
5,Heavy Duty Grey Cord,"Very heavy duty, very HEAVY cord. Note previous reviews that this cord is grey (as stated in product) so don't be fooled by the white picture. Seems to be pretty top quality. Not super flat, so while it might run well against a wall you'll still need to compensate if running it under a mat."
5,Excellent cord,I am very pleased with this extension cord. I use it to attach my power chair to the electrical outlet in order to recharge the chair's batteries. The cord works properly and is appropriate for the task. I do not worry about any possible problems.
2,"Very, very outdated","These volumes from 1978 are over 30 years old and are very much outdated. The current version is the 8th Edition 2010. The 1978 versions would be fine for a reference to old cases or some principles that have not changed, however there have been very significant new developments in the law since 1978 that really make these quite out of date."
3,Rollins on his own and a bit unsure,"Hank's first solo recording away from Black Flag, he seems a little unsure of himself vocally here when handling cover tunes..trying to imitate the vocal stylings of the original rather than making it his own..something that he'd quickly correct soon afterwards. The material is quite good here and the playing is much hotter than the last few Flag releases although not the jazz/metal that the Rollins Band would specialize in later on.The addition of ""The Wifebeating Childhaters"" EP shows Henry's growth as a vocalist, corretcing the problem stated above (see Wire's ""Ex-Lion Tamer"") and showcases his sick sense of humor.Worthwhile for Rollins fans but others proceed with extreme caution."
3,The comic side of Rollins,"Screaming laughter: how else can you react to the 'b'-side of this cd, the work of the fictitious ""Henrietta Collins and the Wife-Beating Child Haters""?! This album rocks _and_ has you rolling on the floor, from the bastardized Beach Boys frolic ""Drive By Shooting"" (complete with ""First Gear/Second Gear"" homage) to the bass-heavy Queen outtake ""I Have Come To Kill You"".Oh - and ""Black and White"" is pretty good, too. ;)"
3,For the collectors and Rollins stalkers only,"Drive By Shooting is just plain funny. Hey Henrietta and Can you Speak This are the jewels of this recording. Men are Pigs, if you haven't heard it, is a classic piece of Henry's spoken-word era. This is history, folks, before the debate circuit, before his appearances on Politically Incorrect, before he was a big movie star."
4,He's a Hot Animal Machine,"Ok so I bought this on the recommendation of Sean and true to his word, it kicks arse! Yes it lacks the ""full custom sound"" of later Rollins Band releases, but that's part of it's appeal. The lyrics are smart and edgy, the riffs catchy and overall it's a cool little album. It usually takes me a couple of listens per Rollins album to really get into it - this was the exception, I liked everything I heard first time. Best songs are Drive By Shooting and I Have Come to Kill You (why do people stare when you laugh aloud at music?!) Just for the record, I NEVER award a perfect score so this is as close as it's possible to get."
5,LIFE GOES ON BY MIKA ARISAKA,"enjoyed the cd-single including the tracks with just the music. if you are a gundam seed/destiny fan you should get this cd it is very good and has a good beat to it. even though you don't know japanese it is still very interesting to listen to. if i were to give it a rating of 1 to 10, I would give it a 10 but the rating system only rates up to five. it is a good end track to gundam seed destiny. I would recommend this cd to all of my friends who love this japanese music. I love the cd cover art which also has a gundam seed destiny picture on it. The tracks I love to listen to are tracks 2 and 4 but I also like tracks 1 and 3. You really need to get this cd and decide for yourself if it is really worth your money."
5,heavy-duty mailbox with beautiful copper patina,"This mailbox complements the Arts & Crafts style of our house and furnishings. It protects mail from the elements and accommodates magazines and catalogs well. The finish is starting to turn into verdigris at the edges, and with a little luck and patience we will have a handsome greenish copper mailbox in a few years. It required some forethought and common sense to install two plywood backboards before I attached the mailbox to the wood siding of the house."
5,karajan rehearsal,"This is an exemplary rendition of a master musician at work. A perfectionist, who was born with an unparalleled muscianship. I reccomend it to any serious musician."
5,Amazing debut album!!!,"Liberty X are the hottest thing coming out of the UK now. They have already released three smash singles there, including the recent #1, Just A Little, and from first listen to their debut album, there's loads more to come. It's enough to buy the album just to hear their first three singles which start the album off, Thinking It Over, Just A Little, and Doin' It. But, thankfully, it doesn't stop there. This album has something for everyone, slick American R'n'B (Wanting Me Tonight), danceable pop (Feel The Rush), midtempo radio-lite (No Clouds), and incredible ballads (Holding On For You). This group has taken their time in releasing this album, and the quality of the songs shows that. Until the record company realizes that Liberty X need to be over on American radio and in our records stores, buy this import album. It is definately worth it if you want good music!"
5,loved it,"as described gf love this panties, and they look great, she says its very comfortable and helps with wearing pants for no lines show."
3,One of the best trainer,Jennifer Nicole Lee is one of the best - if not the best - trainer I'm working out dailyHer DVDs are outstandingly efficient
5,Politically and Socially Relevant Dance Music,"Regenerator's 5th album is a great sign of further artistic development and growth. This is another CD that rarely leaves my stereo. It is focused thematically in regards to the topics of war; religious fanaticism (""God is On My Side""); love, which can be interpreted on many levels, from romantic love to the early Christian concept of Agape (""Take Me""); hope ""Faith"", among others. Unlike the gloom'n'doom of most industrial bands, Regenerator offers hope and optimism instead of fear and pessimism.Musically, they continue the use of their signature sound of thick heavy beats and spacey trance ambience, with slightly more pop-ish, hook-laden sensibilities. It is a testament to their artistry and devotion that they've been around for 10 years, which is somewhat rare for most industrial bands, let alone those on indie labels."
4,Sound advice on innovtion,"The core themes of this book are:* that change is constant and continuous innovation the only viable response* that successful innovation requires 'an holistic approach that aligns strategy and vision, process, leadership style and culture to the innovation ambition'* that there are many ways to start on the journey, but the journey never ends. Innovation is ultimately a way of life.The text is made up of sound advice, well arranged, and interspersed with short essays by experts in the field (such as Gary Hamel and Costas Markides). Each chapter ends with a summary list of 'anchor points'.There is a good last chapter of suggested further reading."
4,Two books in one,"This books was like reading two books in one. The twins, Raven & Peter, were told by the king to wed cousins, Roxy and Pamula. This story is about both of thier adventures to find each other. The writing was very well done and I felt as if I were there. I like authors that can make me feel part of the story.Of course Raven and Peter wanted the bride that didn't belong to them. Each wanted the others entended, made for a lot of hush converstations and quilty feelings. Some of which I found quite comical.I would recommend this book for anyone that likes romances set back in time where they lived in keeps and castles. With the descriptions I could almost smell the land.I read this book over a few evenings. I could have finished it sooner but life got in the way."

4,Right Part Wrong Image,The muffler I received is apparently the correct one for a non-turbo automobile(#47733). The part shown in the picture is the assembly for a turbo vehicle(#47777). Right part number wrong image.
4,"More than a survey, less than a treatise...","The author does an admirable job of covering a wide range of high speed/optoelectronic topics with a more modern (although now almost 10 years old) flavor. The book has more technical detail than in an IEEE Spectrum or Physics Today article, but does not cover almost anything in enough depth to be a textbook for a course. For example, it covers such diverse topics as Kuroda's identities and unit elements used in broadband matching, or will go into MSM photodetector design to the level of supplying the elliptic-integral-laden formula for the capacitance of interdigitated fingers, but does not give the background needed to derive most of these things. I think it is a good higher level introduction to this area, but not a definitive reference."
3,Does not include CA-570,"The description is misleading, it reads ""The CG-570 can be used with the supplied CA-570 Compact Power Adapter..."" The CA-570 is not supplied with this item and is an expensive add-on."
1,A gross out to end all gross outs.,"This is a film for really sick puppies. If you showed this movie to 100 random people in a theater, 99 would walk out within the first half hour. I'd probably stay.It's not surprising that this was directed by the same guy that did ""From Beyond"" and the ""Re-Animator"" trilogy.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hurl.All that being said, I didn't shut this hideous monstrosity off.Warped beyond belief."
2,Fairly decent,"This is a mediocre, low-grade attempt at a horror flick, but it does pretty well. Perhaps worth the rent.But the acting and plot are both very thin, weak and poor."
1,Didn't scare me....,"This movie is a complete waist of time. If you really enjoy movies with 90 minutes of blood, then this just MIGHT be your movie. If you're looking for any kind of quality though, then leave it... Included in my top 5 list of ""the worst movies ever""!"
1,Gorey and poorly acted low budget wanna be suspense film.,"The plot is idiotic, the acting is poor and it looks every bit a low buget film."
3,A Different Type of Slasher Flick,"The Dentist has that trademark Brian Yuzna bizarreness/dark comic feel to it. Personally, I've enjoyed every film of his (Return of the Living Dead 3, Bride of Re-Animator, Beyond Re-Animator...).The dentist's chair was a great choice of scenery for a horror film as that is a place where humans are most susceptible to the advances of a deranged psychopath. The dark humor is found throughout along with a decent storyline which should keep you glued to the tube. The gore scenes are okay, and Yuzna's managed to make some pretty nasty ""dentist-ized"" human atrocities towards the end.If you dig Bride of Reanimator and ROTLD 3, then you should enjoy this fun flick."
2,I would have rather been at the dentist.,"This is a very dumb, and boring movie. It could have been alot better with the gore and story. Its not entertaining of even amusing, just dull. I thought their were going to be more dentil touture, i was wrong. Their isn't even a point, maybe, ""Don't hire poolboys."" Or ""Don't Have Corben Bernson be your dentist."""
4,This movie will make you squirm in your seat,"At first I was reluctant to see this movie. Now I see why I was so reluctant. This movie has scenes that will make you squirm in your seat. It turned out to be a pretty good horror flick.After seeing this movie I might think twice next time I go to the dentist for dental work. It makes me wonder. If my dental hygienist is having a bad day, am I going to end up like Dr. Fienstone's patients???"
4,"Colorforms! Ahh, the memories.","A cute product. Just like a I remember from my childhood. My children enjoy playing with this one. I didn't even know they still made Colorforms until our occupational therapist brought them over for my almost-2 year old twins. The beginning age range for this product starts at age 3, but my 23-month kids still enjoy it.Unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problems at all in taking the Colorforms Stickons off of the page. There is a little arrow with an instruction to ""peel here"", and when I did that, all of the white background came off and each of the stickons came off the paper in about 2 minutes. Some were easier than others to take off, but I certainly didn't rip or tear anything, and didn't need to use scissors at all."
1,Don't bother,"I have always been a big fan of Colorforms, having loved them as a child. My youngest daughter received this as a gift and I had to spend 45 minutes getting the pieces apart. The characters are not punched out of the plastic, the perforations do not go all the way through. Each individual piece had to ultimately be cut apart with a scissors, that was after many tears on the part of my daughter because she couldn't make it work and some of the characters got ripped. All in all very frustrating for a child and VERY CHEAP on the part of the manufacturer."
4,Colorforms last!,"It isn't so easy to find removable stickers anymore and my daughter loves Dora, so this is the perfect toy for rainy days or waiting at restaurants!"
4,good but could have been better,"Don't misunderstand me, I am a long time ELP fan however my expectations go back all way to concerts in the 70's when they toured with a full orchestra. Certainly the last two tracks of the concert bring life to this dvd and finished strong. If you are a long time ELP fan you will not be dissapointed. Gregg Lake voice sounds good but stage presence was lacking but did he ever have stage presence. Keith Emerson was the highlight of the concert and truely shows what a great talent he brings to ELP. That in itself is worth getting this DVD and seeing his talent... Pirates is reproduced very well and was the highlight of this dvd. ..."
5,A must own -peak of their form,"I don't need to tell any ELP fan how great it was to finally get a top quality concert available to us,this is absolutly top notch performances of most of their classics and a terrific example of what DVD can be ,the picture is so sharp you'd think you were there.The sound as well has a nice balance to it as if you were in the hall hearing it,I would also mention to anyone who happen to have the Japanese Laserdisc version of this from a few years ago,dump it immediatly and run out and buy this,that L.D. was an extremly botched job ,as anyone who has seen both will attest to."
3,Sound is disappointing,"Having been an ELP fan since around 1973, I enjoyed this DVD ""for the show"" but I must warn you that the sound quality was, in my opinion, very poor. Much like what was written in another review, I had a very hard time picking up Greg Lake's vocals - his voice was literally drowned out by the instruments. Granted, he's lost a bit of the luster in his range but I still would have liked to heard him better. They're still a blast to watch!!"
2,Dissapointing,The vocal sound on this concert DVD is terrible. Greg Lake sounds like he is singing into a tin can. What Happened? Very dissapointing.
4,"An excellent ELP live performance, evidently the best","I actually own the earlier release of this same concert. It was discontinued at one point, and this evidently is a re-release. The technical specs are the same, so there are not likely to be any differences. This is an excellent live performance, easily satisfy any ELP fan's reasonable expectations. The performance of Pirates is excellent, and the performance ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" is infinitely more inspired and exciting than the vintage performance that you can purchase on the DVD having that title. The other ELP DVD that I have is ""Welcome Back"", and it is an utter waster, due to all of the performances having been chopped up into clips and interwoven with silly interviews. So if you are an ELP fan and looking for a good live performance of ELP, this is the one to buy."
1,Bad Copy,"Update to this review: The seller that sold this copy to me, mikesjazz, was very prompt in refunding my money. Thanks so much.This ELP Live At Royal Albert Hall is a bad copy of the original release. It has no 5.1 dolby what so ever and the PQ is awful.This DVD copy has the emblem of ELP on the cover and is released by the Shout Factory circa 2009.The original LARAH has the band on the cover and was released by Image circa 2001.That version is the original with 5.1 and 2.0 sound options.PQ is not great but better than the copy and is in 4.3 aspect ratio.IF you purchase this DVD make sure the band is pictured on the front cover and the company is Image.P.S. To the sellers credit, he refunded my money in full including shipping."
3,It was worth watching but ultimately disappointing,"Keith Emerson really makes the band. If it were not for his antics and hunting knife wielding, leather-clad persona, then the show would have been a bit lifeless. I love his playing the organ backwards... but who was the jerk who [took] his hat? I hope the guy returned it or gets what's coming to him by the ELP gods.It seemed Greg's microphone could have been louder since sometimes you could not really tell he had begun singing in certain parts...the engineers could've remedied that but did not.I saw ELP in Phoenix in '97 or '98, whenever it was...what a show! I just wish they would do it again sometime.Overall a good DVD but it needed to have the ENTIRE concert contained in it."
3,"Emerson, Lake & Palmer","Recording mix and photography was not good. The music was what I expected. Reviews from other patrons hit it right on the head, but we bought it anyway."
3,Volume too low,"This problem may only relate to my copy, however, I just purchased the DVD and the volume is way too low. You have to raise the volume to 40 to even hear it. Has anyone experienced a similar issue with this DVD?"
1,don't buy it,This DVD is terriblepicture and sound quality is under VHSalmost bootleg qualityhasn't worth to buy
3,i have seen much better,i have seen much much better than this besides mine is not playeble on all dvd players ¡ waste of money.
2,TW,"I'm a huge Janis Reams Hudson fan, but only her historicals. I got through three chapters of this story, Price of Honor and then skimmed it from there. It was not believable to me that the heroine, Rachel would have refused to listen to the hero's explanation, and all these years later there's been no correspondence nor has the real story come out. Even when Grady is back in town and sees her, she keeps refusing to listen to the real story, and that just is not like a woman to do that. It was forced conflict. Furthermore, there was no chemistry whatsoever between these two characters, I found myself actually enjoying the parts where they did not see each other...and the fact that they were not together in a scene, more than when they were."
1,Very Disappointing,"I had similar problems as several other reviewers. I tried a variety of waffle batter recipes but none cooked completely even at the highest heat setting and four times the recommended cooking time. I also had a problem with the latch mechanism and handle; both broke on day two. The latch would not allow for the waffle iron to close completely, which made it impossible to flip. I had to get creative just to pack it back up.I just printed the shipping label, etc., to return to Amazon for a refund."
2,"Makes good waffles, doesn't last","We enjoyed this product while it lasted. It made great waffles and didn't take up a ton of space. Unfortunately, less than a year after we got it the waffler will no longer heat. I called Villaware customer service and they replaced it with a different model since they did not have this one in stock. The replacement also makes excellent waffles; I just hope the new one lasts. I suggest saving yourself the hassle and buying a different product the first time."
5,"Engaging, Unique Twist on the Fairy Tale Format","A Time For Trolls is a wonderful collection of Norwegian fairy tales. The tales are a little more graphic than similar American counterparts; not necessarily for very young children, but not as dark asThe Complete Grimm's Fairy Tales. The stories often start by following a trio of brothers. The youngest is usually a good-for-nothing called Askelad (literally, ""Ash Boy"") who does nothing but sit around and poke at the ashes in the hearth. However, he is wise and kind and determined, and he always ends up with the fortune and the girl. The translation from Norwegian is beautiful and lyrical, with a rhythmic quality reminiscent of oral tradition. A must-read for any fairytale or fantasy enthusiast, and a great look into the history of Norwegian culture!"
4,better than expected,"Sturdy and practical.May last longer than myself, that I can leave it to my son.I am still a hardcore pulling cart fan and not thrilled with 3 or 4 wheeled push carts seen today."
5,This book is EXCELLENT!!!!,"For ANYONE who needed a better, simpler yet more in-depth explanation of the Law of Attraction, look no further. This book, coupled with The Attraction Distraction (Why the Law of Attraction Is Not Working For You and How To Get Results FINALLY, by Sonia Miller). The last 2 books you'll ever need to read to succeed. INCREDIBLE."
2,Poor lifespan,"Not only does this pen quickly run out of ink, but it does so in sputters, so the last writing you do with it always looks terrible."
4,"Cool Blocks are cool, but no blade guides ror 14"" Craftsman is not cool!","I purchased my set of Cool Blocks through Amazon in anticipation of also finding the appropriate blade guides for my 14"" Craftsman Band Saw (model 119.224010). So far I have been unable to find any such guides to fit my saw allowing the change-over from Bearings to Cool Blocks. I didn't pay much for the blocks, so I've left them in their original package - I'm sure they will work perfectly fine, once I'm able to mount and use them.My sincere thanks in advance to anyone having this same model of Craftsman Band Saw and has also found the proper guides required and will be kind enough to respond to me here."
1,Don't use if you have a bad back,Wife got this and thought it was great at first. She started having very painful back problems. Her doctor confirmed that the exercises were seriously throwing her back out. This may not be a problem for people who don't have back problems. The back condition did not reoccur after she stopped using this DVD.
4,I like it!,"This is a great stretching video, especially after a long work day. I found it to be simple and easy to follow along."
3,"Good Accessories, Weak Microscope","Much better than what we found at the BX here in Misawa, but... it is still a low end, plastic microscope.Pros: uses ambient light and has a light that shines up through slide. A lot of accessories for child to play scientist. Collection bottles and tools were a great hit. Everything is kept tidy in the plastic case for easy storage and transport.Cons: The focus is such that the end of the lens is almost touching the slide you're trying to look at.The focus problem almost makes it impossible to use. If we weren't living in Japan I would have returned the item, but it would cost more than it's worth."
5,Sinus headache relief,I had used Dristan many years ago and could not find it in our local stores. This product is wonderful for sinus headaches. Your service was excellent. I received it in a few days and my headache is now gone. I certainly will reorder.
4,The First True Blackberry Book,"I sawed this book about 3 months ago in Borders, and I was totally shocked. I spent a little time and thumbed through this book and read a few sections and right away I saw that it was of great value. I work with Blackberries on a personal and corporate level and this book seems to be ticket. I actually had a chance to converse with Craig over email .. very helpful and informative guy. Congrat Craig on your book!!!! We're waiting for another master piece."
2,Entertaining and not on the subject,"This book is full of the author's entertaining video-shooting experiences, told in an entertaining style. It contains almost nothing of what the title and commercial blurbs suggest it contains. If you are (like me) an amateur video maker looking for tips on creating a higher-quality product while living off your day job,look elsewhere. His definition of ""no-budget"" includes having to rent an old helicopter, rather than a new one, for an aerial shot. The text is full of unexplained technical and slang references to filters, lights, and other equipment but it doesn't matter that you don't understand them because if you're really no-budget you can't afford them anyway.There are a few real gems, like the opening chapter on the history of various video technologies, but these just emphasize the point -- buy this book if you want to be entertained, not if you want to learn anything practical."
2,No Budget digital filmaking,"Not the best of books, contains information that are erssentually no brainers - n o meat and potatoes as they say"
5,Making time with Mickey!!,"My 83 year old Mom had been wanting a Mickey Mouse watch. I guess it's true that Mickey brings out the kid in everyone. Anyway, as always I checked Amazon and they had a great selection. I chose this one hoping it would be clear enough for her to see. Well she loves it. She wears it everyday and loves the face. Thank you Amazon for making my Mom happy!"
3,Strange little book,"Very strange little book, but quite different and imaginative. Obviously Robbins, a cult-favorite among the hippy Phish crowd, must have been under the influence of something while he wrote this. It certainly feels that way. But it reminded me of a fairy tale on crack. I read this a while ago, but nothing really stands out. Maybe it was all one bad trip."
2,Weird as Hell,"I read this book and I was very confused. It was very strange and a little bit too detailed. I think Tom Robbins is a weird author, but if you like that kind of thing then go for it. It was kind of hard for me to get through this book, but when I finished it I was glad that I read it. I liked the ideas that were put across in the book, and the way they talked about choice. This book was weird, but if you want to be confused have fun and read it."
1,Please excuse me while I hurl...,"This book was absolutely horrible. I found it wedged in a crevice next to my rack. Looks like somebody forgot to throw it away. The star of the book, the princess, is one of those whiny young people that tend blame all their problems on everyone else instead of taking credit for their own shortcomings. The book even goes on to glorify criminal activity through the actions of the Woodpecker. I would not recommend this book to people with a level head on their shoulders. I would, however, recommend it to people who insist on being confused about life and people that buy into the whole ""everything has a hidden meaning"" line of thought."
2,Ugh,"This could have been a pretty good read, but Robbins seems more interested in making High Schoolers giggle then focusing on telling a complete story."
5,7 years and counting,"I was given this book in 1994 by a dear freind, i have been reading it since then. I cant put it down or i fear i may lose all i have gained from it!"
5,VERY good!,"This is just an unbelievale book! It's like nothing I've ever read before. It's totally random, yet follows all logic. It goes into so many different subjects yet always stays on one path. Just unbelievable. A must read!"
2,What was that????,"Tom Robbins has many good thoughts, but does not know how to tell a story. On the one hand, I was very interested in what was happening to the Princess, her family, and Woodpecker. On the other hand, I was trying to wade through all his ""chatter"". I enjoyed a little of the ""chatter"" but I think he could have told the story in about half the pages. And in those few pages, he still could have addressed what makes love stay, the camel pack and much more. I would recommend an abridged version of this book."
5,1st Tom Robbins I ever read..,"Then continued to read all of his books. This was by far the best, except """"another road side attraction. But this is the book I give as a present or recomend to people."
1,I'm looking into the return policy,"This book is about as bad as they come. The narration gets in the way of the narrative. The author gets in the way of the narrative with his pointless first person rambles. Oh and there is no narrative. No development of events, nor of (the bundles of whacky/stock that pass for) characters. There is no theme to speak of. For those of you who believe it has a theme about the dangers of dogma, might I suggest the first three books in the Dune series. They actually have that theme.Dune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1),Dune Messiah (Dune Chronicles),Children of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)And as far as it being ""deep"", it's not. It is not even philosophically literate. I've had students who failed my intro to philosophy classes with a deeper understanding than this book's narrative voice has. It's symptomatic of the postmodernist nonsense that permeates our literature departments[...]Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science."
5,D@mn good book.,"My (now husband) dear friend gave me this book years ago. Now i'm not saying it's why i fell in love with him, but it added to the intrigue for sure, because i realized after reading this he had amazing taste, a great sense of humor and intelligence if he thought this book was worthy of passing on. Life in a pack of camels... who knew it could be so fulfilling."
2,repetitive,"I liked it for a while, but I got bored of the same theme, especially since he talks about it so directly. There's only so much you can say about how to make love stay. Actually, it's not really that, it's just that he seemed to keep saying the same thing about how to make love stay. It may not be that either. I just didn't like it all that much, on a somewhat intuitive level, if that means anything at all. I'm not sure why I bothered writing this review, but since I did I suppose I might as well submit it."
1,Not a fan,"I don't often say ""I couldn't stand this book"", but here I am. This one was tough to get through. I would have abandoned hope of finishing it and never looked back had it not been a book club pick."
2,Drink lots of exspresso,"This book will put you to sleep. Allright the beggining is not that bad, but it takes time to get going, and the story never really goes anywhere. A full plot is what is missing from this one. Slightly funny, Tom's typwriter hyjinks are the best part of the book."
4,A fun read by Tom Robbins,"This off the wall book by Tom Robbins is a nice change from the daily books you may read. It is safe to say that is almost like a grown up version of a fanciful children's story. Robbins uses language and small random facts that draw you further into the book, thus making it hard to put down. The story is also the type that doesn't follow the general outline for a plot in other books that you may find on the bookshelf. I would recommend this book not only for the creativity it has inside but also the enthralling language and hooks that are used."
5,Love stays through the mystery of the connection!,"""Still Life"" was great. I've only read two of Robbins' books, and I'm completely enveloped by each page. I read ""Still Life"" in three days, and this was during final exams at college. It's true that love stays from the ""mystery of the connection."" Robbins'is a genius. The novel is sexy, intriguing, and if you've ever loved someone like Leigh-Cheri, it's a muse to fall in love again. You develop a friendship with Robbins. The interludes between moon phases really cracked me up. A guaranteed pleaser to the reader who wants to have fun! Tom makes meta-fiction work."
5,So funny...yet so weird,This has go to be the weirdest story... a perfect read for anyone looking to ecscape the usual plot.
2,Had possibilities,"Tom Robbins is in need of a braver editor or a stronger writing coach. Some of what he says is truly clever, such as ""I have a black belt in haiku. And a black vest in the cleaners,"" then he gets carried away with his own cleverness and bogs down his writing. It isn't enough to have one metaphor--he throws in 4 or more, which even Shakespeare would have difficulty pulling off. The dialogue is quite often composed of things no human being would ever say. I could not find the characters believable or likable, though the servant Gulietta, provided some comic relief."
2,This is good?,A self-absored book...I don't know that I'd call Tom Robbins a genius...most of the images and ideas are weak...and written in a kind of sloppy way...this book is not funny... it tries to be...and it fails miserably...a good book is written with some sensuality of which this has nothing of...I'd say it's more boring than it is interesting...and not any better than those overwrought Dave Barry stories.
2,"cliches, dim wit, and forced weirdness","The advertised love story is kind of interesting, earning a star. At first the characters all seem to be either irritatingly dim-witted or simply irritating, but after a while it becomes amusing. The story, however, doesn't receive as much attention as the other two components of the book.Mostly, Robbins offers readers an astoundingly painful slog through page after page of philosophical cliches, usually presented in metaphors that try a bit too hard to be weird.Interspersed are stories from the author's past -- heavily laden with rationalizations of alternately selfish, foolish, and chauvanistic behavior."
5,I just plain like this book,"I love the way that Tom Robbins writes. Sometimes he is flamboyantly verbose and other times very simple. He makes me laugh, he makes me think. He shows me things about myself that I never had consciously thought of before. It makes me feel strangely intimate with an author that I don't know. It's weird! I read this book in one day, then the next day I was sad, because it was already over. One of my friends said, ""Just go get a different book."" But I didn't want a different book! I wanted to read more about Leigh-Cheri and the Woodpecker. Gulietta! I wanted to learn more about the Camel pack. I wanted to learn more about how to make love last. When people ask me what the books are about, I can never really think of how to describe them. Just amazing."
1,Worst Tom Robbins Book I've Read,"Could not finish. Plot was lost to his ""Peach fish fuzz"" gross talk. The plot might have been ok but after reading half the book I lost interest after all his pre-adolecent musings. Should have been condensed to a teen pamphlet."
2,didn't work for me,"While the story is semi-engaging, I found Mr. Robbins' writing style very self-conscious (i.e. he comes across as though he thinks a great deal of himself and how clever a writer he is). A lot of his ""humor"" falls flat (and he seems so doggedly determined to squeeze a joke out of absolutely everything!). In both of the novels I have read from Tom Robbins, the characters remained two-dimensional. In my mind, the great pleasure in reading novels is the feelings you develop for the individuals, their personalities, foibles, etc. But I don't get that from these people."
3,And now for something completely different,An entertaining read that reminded me that I need to keep my mind open to new ideas. I had problems with the beginning getting to know the characters and overall their really wasn't much story to this book. It was almost a romance novel that was taken for a ride down Goofy's Wiseacre Farm. Anything and everything odd happens. Since that is the case it has problems flowing together as a book. It seems broken and jumpy.
3,Not what I expected,"I really expected more out of this book. It had good moments and a few good quotes, but overall I found it a little trite. I read the reviews of those who loved it and I was excited but for me the book fell flat, the characters were not very memorable and I found myself reading but my mind would wander. I did not dislike the book , I think it is ok . It is not a beach read, but for me it was not a life changing OMG I must recommend this book to everyone."
4,Love it!,I love this author. Some of his books may be slightly difficult to get through but I'm always satisfied. This is a wonderful story.
1,?,I've yet to come across a more verbose writer with less to say ... maybe Joseph Heller ... go out and buy Catch-22 if you liked this one
4,this book will keep you reading,"In this book you will find out about the moon. How solitary confindment will show you the way of a camel pack and the meaning the little pictire on it. It will tell you about CHOICE. Hmm i was so into this book that sometimes i couldnt fall asleep just telling myself that ""one more page"" but the one more page turned into 10 pages then 50 then 100. Until on the second day that i started the book i noticed that i finished it. I was overcome with saddness. This is one of those rare books that you read in 2 or 3 days. Hopfully you will let this book fall into your own hands."
1,The worst book I ever read...,"... and that's saying a lot.Clumsy, self-indulgent and uninspired. Anyone that finds Tim Robbins' humor witty or clever must be just as full of themselves as he or anesthetized.I wouldn't even read this if it was the last book on earth."
1,I don't understand the hype,"Tom Robbins writes self-consciously quirky drivel. I tried to read ""Still Life with Woodpecker,"" for the sole purpose of tallying every time he points out the fact that the two protagonists are redheads (at least once every five pages), but I'm just not enough of a masochist for it. Don't read Tom Robbins. Read ""Catch-22"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"", or ""Breakfast of Champions"" instead."
1,Blackberry 8700 screen protestor,"The protector was too big for the screen, leaving much air in the perimiter of the screen. Screen clarity actually was reduced.Will not recommend this product to anyone, due to my overall dissapointment with this product."
5,Fitness Factor a Fitting Book for Us all!,"The Fitness Factor's appeal is in its use as a tool for the development of a personal health and wellness plan. Having the book is like having your own personal trainer, one who is knowledgeble as well as motivating. It is based on sound eating and exercise principals and provides insight and ideas for its readers."
3,Good but incomplete,"The book includes some hard to think of items but excludes more obvious ones. Where, for example, is the pizza slices you can get only in upper west NYC, or the rye bread slice and pickled cucumbers to go with the sausages of Vien, the squashed grape juice decorated with kivi slices you can get in Beirut, the mashed liver wrapped in pastry leaves and deep fried as done in Moscow, fresh skinned walnut pieces kept in icy cold water as sold in Taheran streets or the fried pineapple slieces of Bangkok served on palm leaves, etc. However, it manages to water ones mouth enough to get up and try some that are described."
1,Disappointing,I've always loved Services' rhymes but this attempt at a novel was disastrous !! Maybe that's why he discontinued writing novels.
2,Not a Good Shape Sorter and Not a Good Drum,"I was disappointed in this product, because I bought it for the the shape sorting aspect, and the sorting side of it is pathetic---you can't twist and lock the round yellow shape sorter, you just pull it out, so any smart kid is going to do just that, and lose any shape sorting play they might have had if the top stayed on. The other side of this toy is an annoying and very loud ""drum"" (which doesn't really work as a drum either; take a look at the red barbell-type thing: that's supposed to be the drumstick) with buttons and songs. My children have played with this toy a lot, but probably only because it's noisy. I wouldn't recommend it as either a shape sorter or as a drum, even for the great price."
2,Why bother owning this?,"This item consists of a neutral density filter and a clear filter. I sent it back un opened. I thought it was a polaroid filter which, for the same price you get from Sony. Firstly there are few times a ND filter would be necessary even on a beach as most camcorders have 1/2000 second shutter speeds and the other filter just protects the camera lens from dirt but puts more glass in the system. Better off to buy a off brand Polaroid filter which gives really good control of glare."
4,An element of my typical work day lunch,"I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, so I've had to cut a lot of the food I liked for lunch, like Ramen bowls. While not a Ramen bowl, this is nearly as convenient, *much* lower in sodium, & pretty tasty."
5,Delicious!,"I eat lots of sardines, in particular those that have the bones and are packed in water. The bones are very soft and are a great calcium source. These Season sardines are delicious, and don't have the fishy taste that I've come across in other brands. The flavor is very similar to Roland sardines packed in water. They can sometimes be hard to find and I was delighted to be able to order them here."
2,Tries too hard and doesn't really get there,"I usually like to write something positive in a review but I'm finding it difficult this time. It's hard to define what's wrong with Hidden Echoes: the idea is good, the characters reasonably original - but you can't help feeling it's lacking something. The writing is stilted and seems to be trying to describe everything and still remain slick, which it fails to do. And some of the dialogue honestly makes you cringe. Apart from that, it's a basic fantasy novel, if not a wholly original concept - this world and others will end if some mighty task is not completed by certain people - with some interesting bits and descriptions which catch the eye."
3,Interesting concepts regarding journey mapping and time.,"I thought this was quite an interesting book depicting parallel worlds. I think it provided just enough escapism without getting too intense although some parts of the book really fed my imagination!! I used this book to ""rest"" between the serial books I prefer to read. I liked the mix of character personalities and the beasties. I keep looking for a follow-up book as the ending left just enough of an opening to for a sequel."
5,Wonderful,"If you're looking for a mystery without the usual godlike detective, this is worth reading. Molly's father is a riot.Who would have guessed that Rumpole's author could have written such a lovely story?"
1,contents lacking,"This book gives SOME clue as to how to cut your own or others' hair. However, I was not happy with the content of the guidelines for the following reasons:1. The front page is terribly misleading. There are color photos on it. The contents on the inside of the book shows black and white hand illustrations with barely enough instructions.2. The illustrations and directions left me feeling like some steps were missing for a decent cut.3. Simple instructions/steps were spread across SO MANY PAGES. Was the author doing this to avoid from selling a book with only a few pages?The book simply was not comprehensive enough for me to feel confident to pick up a pair of scissors to cut anyone's hair, let alone my own."
2,Waste of $$$,"This book gives very basic instructions of how to trim hair, which I've already figured out on my own. I was looking for help with cutting hair to different styles, but that's not what this is. I found this book to be disappoining and a waste of time and money."
4,funny anime not too crazy about the new packaging,"I bought school rumble season one S.A.V.E so I got this one too. The new packaging kinda sucks the first one had the disks all in one plastic case, this one has to smaller ones in one cardboard case. mine already has a big dent in one corner.Other then that great anime the new opening song is annoying. if your a fan i recommend getting this version."
4,Better than the first one.,"I would give this five stars, but I feel it isn't quite perfect. It is much better than School Rumble the first semester. This one takes off in crazy directions that reach past left field. I had a lot of laughs. For the most part all the love triangles are one sided, no two people like eachother. Lots of misunderstandings that lead to crazy events, lots of emotional uproars that lead to new discoveries and enlightenment that will make you laugh and cry. You will find yourself inlove with the characters and discover yourself playing match maker, who belongs with who, and why she should be with him. It is crazy that the Rumble draws you in. I promise, you will enjoy this one especially if you liked the first."
5,Dishware,"I saw these dishes in Bed Bath and Beyond and would have bought them there. However, they were out of stock, and they did not have the server pieces. So, I came home and searched online and found them at Amazon for the same price.They were shipped to me in three different shipments. One dish was broken in each of two of the shipments. One dinner plate was broken in one of the services of 4 and one serving bowl was broken in the set of three servers. Amazon re-shipped the two sets to me and I did not even have to return the broken pieces. I am now a Prime member and do most of my shopping at Amazon!"
2,What a shame,"I have these dishes and LOVE them. I wanted the completer set to match. I have ordered this set 4 times and every set has arrived with at least one broken piece in it. Amazon has been wonderful about me returning the broken dishes. 222 Fifth packages this ""fine china"" in inadequate cardboard - NO bubble wrap. Amazon packages 222 Fifth box in bubble wrap - but I guess not enough bubble wrap. I have had DVD's sent to me packaged better! I cannot find the completer set at any of my local stores and I give up on getting them through the mail. What a shame!"
5,Literary Masterpiece,This belongs on your bookshelf next to Kafka and it is one of the funniest things you'll ever read. The Simpsons is tame compared to this stuff.
5,"A Damn Funny Book, one of his best",An untypical look at life and phycological behaviors of humans. A Humungously funny book written with utter truth.
1,Boring and confusing,I gave up after 30%of the book. Even after reading 30% I can not tell you what the book was about. It made no sense to me at all................boring and confusing. Even skimming made no difference.
3,Puzzling,"I wasn't sure how I felt about this book and was curious to see how other people perceived it. Was interested to see that people either love it or hate it. Not I. I enjoyed much of the writing but was often confused. Who's she talking to? Where is she? When is it? She brings up a question and leaves it hanging, let's us wonder for a long time about what happened to her sister, says the last time she saw Randall, but then sees him again, says she never saw Daphne again, but she does...I certainly wouldn't say it's a terrible book and I'm not sorry I read it, but I'm not sure I would reccommend it either. I agree that I'll probably think about it awhile."
1,The worst book I read this summer,"I read numerous books this summer, all great, until I picked up this one. It was so confusing to tell which voice the author was trying to use from chapter to chapter. The author also gave the main character a fantasy world which was also difficult to disguish from her real world. There are so many other wonderfully written books out there, choose one of them before you waste your time with this one."
4,Beautiful and tragic,"I finished reading this book in a couple of hours - I could not put it down! I don't really understand the point of the whole story, but the emotions I felt while reading it is what sticks in my mind. What was implied affected me more than the words on the page (as Randall says, ""you had to read between the lines."") The author has a beautiful and lyrical style of writing, and I loved the way she weaved the different stories together and around each other. Randall was the most fascinating character for me. While reading the book I kept wishing I could know what he was thinking. However, since this is from Ellen's point of view, I guess he will remain a mystery figure to me. This book definitely left me wanting more."
5,The Crown Prince,"It was great that you recomende this DVD, as I am very interested in the family Habsburgh, the story of Emperor FransJoseph and his wife Elisabeth, (Sissi) and the family. So would like to know if there are any other DVD's on thissubject."
3,"Historical, yet trampled again","I was waiting with high hopes till this series was released. Again my hopes were dashed. I agree with other reviewers to the role Brigitte Hamann played (or not played in this case). Vetsera with blond hair, Marie Wallersee with dark hair, Crown Princess Stephanie with dark hair, a portly Kaiser and a sour Empress with the 'wrong' lover. The part I enjoyed was the part of Mitzi Casper.What happened to Rudolph's relationship with Hungary, his relationship with his Grandmother?? No, they could have made something special and again they failed."
4,W A N T E D........A U D R E Y......H E P B U R N.......V E R S I O N,"I am sure that ""THE CROWN PRINCE"" is full of drama, good acting, great dialogue and wonderful costumes. However, in the 1950s, Audrey Hepburn once appeared in an early-TV drama on the Mayerling Tragedy. I don't remember what program showcased it, but I remember to this day how enchantingly lovely she was. No one can ever make as graceful and as sweetly-humble, (but never humiliated!) a curtsey as Miss Hepburn did in that drama. As the Baroness Maria Vestsera, she knew her place. Or rather, her placeS. Onc was as a lady of the court of Franz Joseph. But the other was as the could-be wife of Crown Prince Rudolf. How much tragedy that would have prevented. And how much joy to see a very young Miss Hepburn in that role again! A perfect companion to the more modern version ""The Crown Prince"".I'm sure I'm not the only person who would REALLY like to buy both of these versions, together!"
5,Book comes alive,"Having read the books I was really keen to see the film. It seemed strange the characters having different names but it is a privacy thing I guess. The film made the book come alive being able to see first hand how she lived rather than just imagine. A little disappointed didn't stick strictly to story line but that's show biz I guess. The book made her appear Brave and strong the film portrayed her as foolish and naive.I think you should advertise that it is the English version ofThe White Massaibecause i wasn't sure.When it started off in German with subtitles i was a little worried, but then they started in English Phew!Excellent, i thoroughly recommend it to anyone who has read the book,or has been to Africa and fallen in love with the culture. I have given it to my eighteen year old daughter to read before she goes to work in Africa for a year :)"
4,THe white massai,"IT WAS 6 YEARS AGO WHEN I FOUND BOTH BOOKS IN THE FRANKFURT AIRPORT IN GERMAN LANGUAGE.ON MY WAY TO THE US, I READ THE FIRST BOOK. I LOVED THE STORY, ADMIRED THE COUREGE OF CORINNE HOFFMAN.THE BOOK 2 I READ IN AMERICA.I LOVED BOTH BOOKS AND THE FILM DID NOT DO JUSTICE TO THE BOOKS. I READ BOOKS RATHER, HOWEVER I WONDEREDHOW THAT MOVIE CAME OUT. MY ADVICE IS, READ THE BOOKS, BETTER UNDERSTANDING.MY MANY THANKS TO CORINNE, SHE WENT THROUGH A LOT FOR A LOVE SHE GAVE ALL FOR AND RECIEVED FROM HUSBAND NONE!GLAD SHE FOUND HER WAY BACK HOME, 'HEIMAT' WE SAY OR VATERLAND. YES AFRICA IS BEAUTIFUL BUT ALSO DANGEROUS.MONIKA NILLES"
3,Born to Exile,Born to Exile was a really good book but i wish it had a sequel. It ended rather abruptly. The story was good though.
3,A Pleasant Little Book,"This small paperback is not very detailed or specific, and it is clumsily written. However, it also contains some valuable information. Once you get through the ""Ah-shucks"" tone and digest the author's apparent reluctance to learn Russian, there's a lot of information, certainly enough to justify the low price. But ""war and Peace"" it is not. Also the gritty details are often absent. It feels like this book is what you would read if you went out to dinner with the author and his wife. Interesting, but not enough...."
4,And the modern girl was elated...,"Warnings are in order for the uninitiated - this album is addictive! Raw and unrefined, *Little* may very well be the essential Vic. I first heard this work on vinyl many years ago; I finally wore the grooves off the old LP and decided to break down and buy the CD. It is a piece of art that I have continued to enjoy over many years, and through many changes in musical taste.This listener finds Vic's edgy lyricism to be a beautiful thing. However, if you are a fan of slick, highly produced recordings, this may NOT be the album for you. Also, if you are one of those who do not enjoy hearing the accents of the rural South, you may want to give it a pass. Everybody else, dig in!An all-time favorite."
5,"English Heritage, 3rd ed., is in print","As co-author and general editor of The English Heritage (2 vols, 3rd ed., 1999), I wish to state that this textbook is now in print, and has been in print continuously from the first edition (1978), the second edition (1988), to the present third edition (1999). It has always been published by Harlan Davidson, Inc., Wheeling, IL. Please request English Heritage from Amazon.com, and ask them to include up-to-date information. Earl A. Reitan."
4,Should have been released in widescreen.,"Having previously bought the Artisan release of ""Mountains of the Moon"", I was hoping that this labeling was faulty just as the labeling had been on that disc. Both DVD's were labeled as standard versions. Whereas ""Mountains of the Moon"" was, in reality, a widescreen presentation, ""American Heart"" is sadly fullscreen, just as the packaging indicates. Why do companies, such as Artisan, insist on releasing movies in fullscreen?! Like many other viewers, I abhor pan and scan."
4,Jack Spicer review,"THIS IS ABOUT AS GRITTY AND REAL AS MOVIES GET WITH CONVINCING ACTING BY ALL. IT IS NOT A ""FEEL GOOD"" MOVIE, AND IT MAY TAKE LOTSA PERSEVERENCE TO STAY WITH IT TO THE END.WORTH WATCHING ONE TIME ONLY UNLESS YOU'RE INTO NONSTOP MISERY."
3,Fulci is a weirdo,"This movie suffers from poor editing and camerawork. If you're tripping balls I could see it being a very touching tale of romance, death and redemption. The lighting is really annoying, and the soundtrack will make you wince. I suggest House of Clocks over this."
2,Pretty awful for a bad movie,Ator is way cooler. This was just dumb. But it did have a topless chick in it. And laser arrows.
2,not results yet,"I have been applying this cream 2 times a day for almost three months,and there hasn't been any changes in my scars from Chicken Pox (I had Chickenpox/Varicella 8 months ago). However I'll finish the second bottle (I bought 2 together) and let you know if something happens, because they said you have to use it for 3 to 6 months; and that's the only reason for my 2 stars."
3,Missing workouts,I love these workouts but for some reason they are missing a few of the workouts. I would select the workout for arms and it would play for 5 seconds then move on to the next workout. Manufacture defect? I dunno!
5,Great Routines!,I've only tried the legs and arms routine and I think they're great! Don't miss the change to have a rocking body :D
3,Great for short burst of workouts,"I tried the DVD, but for someone who is not advanced, some of the moves will be challenging. I do however like the pace and the burst of cardio it gives."
3,Not Exactly what I thought....,"I usually love the Firm but this one, although it has good workouts, is not what I thought it would be based on the description. It's great if you really do just use each 10-minute segment separately, but if you decide to do all of them for a longer workout, it's too much of the same. It's supposed to be focused on different body parts: Legs, arms, bikini body, absolute core and bun burn. I didn't really feel the arms workout was enough focused on the arms, and not sure what the bikini body is supposed to do. The Absolute core is supposed to be abs, but again, there's movements in that that are so similar to the other sections that it doesn't deliver the arms workout; my arms didn't get worked out much at all. In the end, it seems like it's all mostly squats, which the firm does too much of anyways (for my taste), so I'm not thrilled with it and probably won't use it unless I do just want a 10-minute workout."
4,Good DVD,"Always can count on the firm for good, quick workouts you can do at home when you can't get to the gym."
5,Great for Beginners!!,This is the second DVD I have bought from the Trautman's series. My fience' and I are preparing for our wedding and will be able to use several of these steps during the night. I can't believe we are having fun learning together instead of being frustrated with each other. Shawn breaks the steps down in such a way that we picked most of it up easily. (we're still practicing) Worth it.
5,PERFECT GIFT FOR MY AUNT & UNCLE,"My aunt and uncle are in their late 60's and took up line dancing at the community center about a year ago. Now they attend 3 times a week and sometimes help teach the classes.As a gift, I decided to buy them a copy of this DVD and they absolutely love it. They haven't heard of amazon.com before and are now asking me where they can get more dances. Fortunately, I was able to search and find more DVDs from the same instructors.I couldn't believe it as they were using just the step sheets to try to learn the dances. Since they had past experience dancing other dances, they were able to easily pick up the lessons in this DVD after just a couple times through. Now they're even shopping at the local western store for shirts, hats, etc. and have been going to the Country Western night clubs once a week in addition to the community center.Many thanks to Shawn and Joanna for creating theses DVDs and helping me give the perfect Xmas gift to someone I had no clue what to get!"
4,Easy enough to learn,The dances are easy enough to learn. I suppose it depends where you go dancing if all of these dances are applicable. My fiance and I found one of the dances on the video useful and fun. It is easy instructions. You can catch on quick to the steps as the instuctor demonstrates and explains.
4,Easy-to-follow instruction,"My Wife and I really like this DVD. The only complaint is they use generic music while demonstrating. It would be better if they would use approved ""covers"" of tunes we recognize that fit the dance steps."
5,Great treat bag,"I really liked this bag until my dog stole it and ate it. Unlike some of the other models, it has two clips so it stays upright when clipped to your clothing instead of turning sideways like the one clip models do. The pocket in front is spacious and I like the ability to draw the bag closed (quickly done when you get the hang of it), however, when open, the lining can get in the way when you stick your hand in and you can grab the little ball lock thing, so I usually fold the lining fold down over the rim of the bag but it sometimes slips off.It holds a lot of treats but it's not too deep so I was able to use it for tiny treats for parrots but also larger treats for dogs."
4,More than romance,"It took a while for me to get started, but once I started reading, I couldn't put down the book. Christine Monson managed to create interesting and memorable characters against a complex backdrop of British colonialism, subtle or blatant racial prejudices on all sides, and in the midst of it all, two strong people who overcome so much to realize poignant love. Lysistrata is a woman ahead of her time, strong-willed and unafraid to challenge the system. Richard Harley - or Ram - is a man caught between two worlds and belonging to neither and conditioned from childhood to distrust tender emotions. Combined with all the plots to discredit and frame Richard Harley, the story weaves through rebellions, kidnapping, tense courtroom battle, and a great finish. Highly recommended."
2,"If your heroine is a rich society girl and her friends are rich as well, don't apologize for it","The It Girls series for Bombshell has a fun premise--high society girls as secret agents. In short, Paris Hilton meets Sydney Bristow. What should have been a fun, action packed book instead was clunky,flat and uninteresting. The beginning half of the book was cluttered with flashbacks, coincidences and a clunky attempt at showing the establishment of the Gotham Roses.Coupled with the author's unneccesary attempts to make Madison seem more ""accessible"" to the average person unlike the aforementioned real-life heiress, an unconvencing and undeveloped ""romance""(that frankly, I found to be unrealistic due to social differences--even in the 21st Century), and a distinct lack of risk in concern to the plot, this book fell short of what it could have been. The preview for the next novel reads a bit better than this one, which is why I shall continue to follow the series."
4,Clear and to the Point,"Mr. Madrid's book is clear and to the point. The ""easy read"" format makes the book enjoyable for the ""religiously"" challenged. The last chapter alone is worth the price of the entire book. The misconceptions surrounding Pope Pius XII and World War II were enlightening. Since Mr. Madrid quotes many secular sources and non-Catholic contemporaries, the book comes through as a reliable piece of verifiable literature."
4,Wow... Some serious coverage!,"First things first... this sucker is BIG. It's also kind of heavy, which can be an issue if you have an adjustable shower arm like I do.That said, it's a worthwhile purchase. The coverage is fantastic, and the pressure is great, even with the flow limiter left in. If you need more pressure to wash shampoo out of your hair, you can get it with the flick of a switch.I suppose it looks a bit bizarre, but I'm not too concerned about that. I'm concerned about how it works, and it DOES. It also goes on easy, and without tools. I had this AND a new shower arm installed in about 10 minutes."
1,Poorly made and okay functionaly,"Had to return this immediately as it broke with in the first few days. Most of the construction is plastic and easy to break. The weak spot seems to be the toggle that switches the showers modes. If it doesn't break the first week, it will the first year. Besides that its just an average shower head. Good price but you will end up replacing in a year. So in summary, if you don't mind buy 1 per year, knock yourself out and get it."
3,"Love the adjustable water spray, but 2 have broken","I bought one of these showerheads at wal-mart a few years ago. I loved the wide water spray. I am a bigger guy and hated having to dance around in the shower to get rinsed. My wife loved using the narrow spray. She wanted more pressure to rinse her long hair. We both loved having the adjustable shower head.Unfortunately, the first shower head broke after a few months. The part that broke was the button to adjust the spray to wide or narrow spray. I bought another showerhead thinking it was a fluke. It wasn't. The second one broke the exact same place after only a few months. there were only two of us using this showerhead and I guess that was two too many.I give it 3 stars for the fact that it is adjustable. I took away two stars for reliability."
5,Great water pressure,I had purchased this model for one of my showers and had to get another for the other. Great pressure. Great price.
5,Waterpic AST,"Great, cheap affordable shower head. I installed this shower head with a Danze S arm and couldn't ask for a nicer, calming shower. It feels like were standing in the rain. Highly recommend."
2,Tries to be 2 types of shower but not good at either,"This shower head can function either as a rain shower where it uses all the jets, or as a more traditional shower where it only uses the nozzles in the middle of the shower head.The problem is it isn't good at either.In rain shower mode, you notice the rain pattern isn't very even. Its stronger in the middle, and very soft towards the edges. It feels weak and disappointing even for a rain shower.In the traditional mode, there are insufficient nozzles for it to compete with a single function head like a Kohler Katalyst model. Further it's not that powerful even without the flow limiter.Final issue is the build quality is really poor. It's all plastic and feels really cheap. Can't imagine this lasting."
5,Get drenched!,This is the best shower head I've ever had. The option to go with a full-body spray or concentrated central spray is ideal. Love it.
5,Best shower head every!!,I have had the normal rain showerhead and they are great but this one is even better with the jet spray in the middle!!!
4,As Advertised,"The showerhead puts out a very nice stream of water, although it's not as powerful as I had anticipated after reading other reviews. I removed the prefilter and the regular filter. The first yielded a stronger stream and the second made no difference. Installation was a snap. No plumber's tape required. It's nice to have a wide stream for rinsing and, as others have noted, it does not leave the tub enclosure like a normal showerhead with a conical stream. This one is totally tubular! Get it!"
1,"""Piece of Junk"" describes this perfectly.",Please save your money. This shower head is a cheap piece of junk and will definitely break like all the claims state. It's a shame because it is a nifty shower head. They should just engineer it a little better and it will deserve the high rating some give it.
1,UTTERLY WORTHLESS!!!!,"I recently purchased and installed this item, Had ONE very satisfying shower only to have the thing break on me the NEXT day. I've used other waterpik items before but none as unreliable as this. Take my advice STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,Very nice shower head for the money,"When I first ordered mine over 3 years ago, there was only one review which said the head didn't move. I found it hard to believe and decided to take a chance on it anyway since it was extremely cheap. Turned out the head had plenty of move, even rotated sideways, and worked beautifully. Water was strong even in full spray mode and jet mode was a total blast. This was the best shower head I have had.I am only giving it 4 stars because mine broke at the neck while I was adjusting it one cold winter night, leaving me scrambling for a spare head. However, a brand new replacement arrived at my home less than a week after I contacted Waterpik. Gotta love the lifetime warranty."
5,Waterpik Showerhead,"Enjoyed this showerhead from my first shower. It was very easy to install, about ten minutes, The gentle shower spray it great and it does not cause water to splash all over the shower."
5,perfect for low water pressure apartments!,"My husband and I just moved into an apartment in the Northeast with very low water pressure. We both have really thick hair, so a low water pressure shower means a frustratingly long shower and 5 minutes rinsing the shampoo out of our hair. This showerhead is amazing! I was a little concerned by the sheer size of it (think oval shaped standard size restaurant dinner plate) because I wasn't sure how my low water pressure shower would even be able to get water through all of the holes of the showerhead, but Waterpik has some sort of pressure amplifying technology built in, and it works wonderfully. On the lighter of the two settings, I have a nice strong stream in the center that's perfect for hair washing and gentler streams in the periphery so that my entire body is hit by the water at once. I have no idea how Waterpik managed to make this showerhead, but it's a great product and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants an efficient and thorough shower!"
1,Garbage! Huge disapointment.,"I never even had a chance to try it out. As I was installing this showerhead, using nothing but my hands, I was tightening the showerhead to the fixture, turning and turning with no resistance, until the connecting nut snapped in half! Why would they make this piece out of such cheap plastic? Without this connecting piece, the showerhead is completely useless. A waste of $26.I normally rely heavily on the product reviews for Amazon, and all I can say is this one is way off. This was a real piece of garbage, and I am frustrated becuase I have no recall to do anything about it. Can't return it to Amazon because I opened the package. Just have to suck up the loss and put the old showerhead back on.Take my advice and think twice about this product. Get a showerhead made out of metal. It is probably worth spending the extra money on. Amazon, as a regular shopper, all I can say is what a huge disapointment."
1,Broke within one month,"The portion that attaches this head to the stem is plastic. Every time you adjust the angle of the shower spray (which is every time someone showers if people of different height live in your house) it puts strain on this part. It shattered, and I bought a similar head from Moen that has all metal parts.As a purely decorative piece I would give it 5 stars, but for practical purposes, just 1."
2,"Average, nothing spectacular.","2 weeks of anticipation, i was hoping a fire hose blast all i got was an average showerhead; nothing to celebrate. those in search of some power need to look elsewhere, this is not it. after a week of usage, i have to revert back to my old shower head; what was i thinking.........."
5,Great item for the price!,It was easy to install and works great. It's not as strong of a flow as some of the reviews state. It's definitely a great product for the price!
5,shower head,I purchased this shower head for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! It's a water saver but gives a good strong shower and great coverage.
5,Wow,I recently moved into a house that has a Waterpik showerhead. After my first shower I was sold. I liked it so much that I purchased the same model for several members of my family.
4,So far so good,"It has been about 6 months since purchasing this showerhead. Replaced an old - I mean really old - showerhead. Great spray area - could wash the dirt off an elephants behind - sorry bad analogy - I was using the reflection to shave my face - that is how large this showerhead is - only downside is there are several spray openings that no longer have spray coming out - I am thinking this is a result of our hard water and assuming the opening have become clogged but I cannot be certain as of this writing. For us, this was an upgrade, was a great price and has worked well."
3,"Big and powerful, but ...","First, a lot of reviewers complain about how fragile this item is. Yes, it's chromed plastic, so those expecting metal will be disappointed. But only a Neanderthal would have to use real force for installation -- I needed a wrench to remove my old head, but this one was up and working in all of 30 seconds without any tools.Next, remove the flow restrictor and this has plenty powerful spray, oh yes. Four key flaws for me, though: 1) the outlets are all pinstream (meaning that muscle ""massage"" is minimized), 2) there are only two spray settings, 3) when set to the narrower spray, the force is too great and the pinstreams become annoyingly stinging, and 4) there's no hold setting.Bottom line: It looks good, installs easily, and works well on wide spray, but for the above-stated reasons I'm going back to my multi-setting hand-held."
5,like a bath standing up,"best deal for the money, was a little reluctant after reading post about the mount breaking easily, but it seemed pretty standard to me maybe some people don't know to use thread tape working with plumbing idk."
4,WOW! What a showerhead!,"The Waterpik AquaScape Dual Mode Oval Chrome Showerhead makes taking a shower a real pleasure. Finally, a showerhead with a lot of spray jets that actually have some force behind them! The large, oval shape keeps the flow in the center and can be adjusted up or down. It was extremely easy to screw on - took just a few seconds, and doesn't need any kind of tape to avoid leaking. The adjustment on the back of the showerhead changes the flow to a stronger, concentrated stream if preferred, but others have stated this part breaks easily if changed frequently. Since I absolutely love the forceful flow of using all the jets, I probably won't be changing it to the power stream. I now look forward to shower-time."
4,"Yeah, i'm clean and rinsed","This does the trick for total body coverage. The pressure is nice, and the head is wide. Be careful switching the settings, the piece pops off and water sprays everywhere. I agree, this could be more heavier and better material. But, it does what it states, and looks nice. i can shower faster with this wide head. And rinsing off is improved too. The second setting lets water flow through the middle holes. It's kind of intense. It does fell good on my back though. It feels like a massage. I recommend this to anyone who wants a better shower experience."
5,Works Great,This shower head works great and I got a great price. Because of the great price I bought 1 and then I bought 2 more.
1,Cheap Plastic Crap,"We bought this for our new apartment having no idea that it would be so flimsy. During the easy installation everything was going fine when the pipe connection cracked and sent the shower head flying towards the ground. While trying to simply hand-tighten per the instructions this product snapped in two places and is now completely useless. Fork over the extra money and buy something more substantial, we wish we had!**On the plus side their Customer Service was very responsive and are sending us a replacement so I guess we'll give it one more shot! Thanks Katie!"
2,Not the kind of shower I like.,"This showerhead was a disappointment to me. I like gentle, soft, drenching showers. This provided more of a medium flow of water, with a medium-stingy jet of water. After four months of use, the nozzles clogged up, and the stream became downright needle-like.On the positive side, the shape of the shower head was great. It provided a nice, wide, uniform coverage. It is a good design in that regard.But this one was not for me. My favorite so far is the Deluge Country Club Showerhead. My second favorite is the Pollenex Pouring Rain Showerhead."
4,Another excellent Waterpik product,We get the same amount of water output as the standard 'rainshower' showerheads but a lot more powerful. Picture yourself caught in a warm water thundershower and you'll get an idea of what to expect from this product :) .
5,Love this shower head,"this is a replacement of our original shower head purchased 6 years ago. Really love this shower head and was worried this model would have been discontinued. Replacement was necessary as a leak developed around the ""plastic screw on fitting"" caused by using pliers for re-installing after a routine cleaning of the shower head nozzles. So I advise ...be gentle when removing and installing the shower head as not to damage the plastic fitting."
5,Great,No complains. As advertised and reviewed by other people. Pretty big shower head too...don't know if that's a good or bad thing but its great for me.
4,Amazing shower head!,"We moved into our NYC apartment, and the shower head was pathetic! Couldn't understand why as we have great water pressure. Did some research and checked out other reviews on Amazon. This shower head gives a high-quality spray with a wide coverage and has made a huge difference. The option to have a high pressure shower is invigorating, but too much for anything more than a shoulder massage!"
3,Quick but tiny book!,"This book is huge, though it's roughly 6 inches in length making for very small print. It covers just about every subject in the Civil War chronologically though it isn't very detailed. There is simply too much covered in order for it to be that way but this book does feature everything-just quick. I seldom refer back to this book for information as anyone who seriously studies the Civil War will have other or better books on the subject."
3,Good book,"The book is very new, but it took a long while for it to arrive.After I ordered this book, it was delivered after two weeks. This is a little bit too long."
5,Magnificient in its own essence,"I found this book extremely easy to read and makes a great addition to the library owned by an organic chemist. Certainly, this book deserves much attention and I believe that it describes many concepts in a simpler manner when comparison to Jerry March's book is called upon. The book is well-written and is exactly what undergraduate students interested in organic chemistry need to read if they want to expand their knowledge of the field without getting into a complex text right away. Definitively, I recommend this book in the shelf of any practicing and non-practicing chemist."
4,Strong Organic Text,"I thought that the book was clear and interesting. It explained the reactions in sufficient detail for the first graduate level organic class I took.My only complaint was that there was no answer guide. The answers are given as literature references, necessitating that you go look them up. When you are assigned 30 of his problems, that's not a trivial task, especially when some of the journals are esoteric. Also, finding the journal isn't enough, as often the journal citation has nothing to do with the problem. The ""answer molecule"" might just appear somewhere in that article.And then, to add insult to injury, there are errors in the citations.It's a great reference, but I wish that the problems in the book had more readily available answers."
2,Unimpressive,"I've had a number of upper level courses. This (and part B) may be good for undergrads taking an advanced course but not for grad school. There are a number of errors and important subjects are glossed over or not covered at all. The best part of either of these books are the questions at the end of the chapters. There are lots and lots of questions. If you need it for a class, I'm sorry, if you're looking for a comprehensive advanced organic textbook, get the latest edition of March's book."
1,I tried and I tried......,"but after a week of trying to get through the first 20 pages, I realized that this book just wasn't for me. I'm a pretty fast reader, but with this book, I found myself re-reading the same pages over and over again. I guess it's all just a matter of opinion. You'll either love it, or downright hate. There's no in between."
2,Annoying dialect,It was hard to get into this book because her main character speaks in this really annoying and improbable dialect.
5,Brilliant!,"For British viewers who are fed up with the over censoring, then this video is a must. The fights are up close and uncensored and there is a good interview with Jerry."
2,Buy Wild Relationships Instead,"I would suggest you buy ""Wild Relationships"". It is the best and has most of the same yet longer scenes than this one. It's ashame there is not more video done on the old shows that shocked us all."
2,An Average,The video is censored which is dumb. The video does have some funny parts and the fights but you have to put up with the [beep] [beep] and so on. I think Jerry could have improved this tape!
2,*Yawn*,"I will admit there is some interesting stuff in the book but most of it I found to be quite boring. Also the book is in black and white with poor quality photographs. The book did introduce me to two interesting people, Bart Prince and William Eckerman, check out their web sites."
5,Sons of Anarchy season 1,You have to give it time to establish each character. It really gets going towards the middle of this season.I have already ordered seasons 2 and 3. Really addicting!!!
5,Captivating!,"It is obvious that a lot of thought went into the script and casting of this show. Has the ability to appeal to a wide audience. Tragic love story, bad boy with a soft heart, fall from grace, any one of these descriptions could fit as well as many more. Great story line for the man and woman of the house."
5,OMG,I was hooked after the very first show I am now into the third season can't wait to see what happens next.
5,Sons of Anarchy,"I bought this series because a friend told me it was great. I'm hating myself that I waited this long to get on the band wagon. The cast is amazing! Katey Sagal is such a great actress! I know, Peg Bundy, but seeing her as Gemma really lets you know how fantastic of an actress this lady really is. A must see of a show. I can't wait to start Season 2."
2,asked for a return and i got no reply,well i got this move for a friend and she had it already..... i returned this item and i got no refund i am very mad and upset....
3,S.O.A. dvd season 1,"good service from amazon. dvd was less than i expected. i had already seen parts of season 1 this year , season 2. don't get me wrong i love the series !"
1,I must be watching a different show?,"Wow I can't believe the rave reviews for this series. I just started watching so maybe it gets better. Where do I begin, terrible writing, bad acting and boring characters (especially any scene with Katie Segal or Ron Perlman) the main guy Jax is dull as dishwater. Why does any series on FX, HBO, Showtime or AMC that is full of violence, bad language and weird characters get rave reviews? It still takes good acting and writing to make a good series. Sons has none of these. IMHO"
5,A story line that stays with you,My absolute favorite TV series there for a while. I didn't much care for the last season -- to un-necessarily violent
5,Love it!,I was super happy that I was able to catch up when I needed to! Shipped on time never had any issues
3,Disk Froze,"The disc were delivered on time which I appreciate. Unfortunetely, two of the disc froze at certain points of the show. I had to skip over thse parts of the disc. They were brand new and out of the box."
5,Addictive,I bought this and season two and season three for a Christmas gift for my daughter and she LOVES them all!
3,Pretty Good,"Like any series of this genre, I found there was a lot of down time. It was entertaining, but I did not find it as compelling as a show like 24 or Breaking Bad."
5,prompt and courteous !,"Had a lil hiccup with first product , but i am very happy with the fast , courteous attention received to remedy the situation !!! I have been wanting this for a long time and i am all smiles :-) i will definately gonna be a repeat customer !!!"
5,Christmas Gift for my Husband,He just finished a marathon of the first season and now is heading into Season 2. I purchased all four seasons since the series is done for a few months. Should get him happy for a time.
5,Whole season in One sittiing!,"Son's of Anarchy, what a show! So exciting we watched the whole season in one sitting! Not available in Australia, but heard raving reviews from friends and ordered online. Not one thing about this show that disappoints!!! Charlie Hunnam OMG! What a change from Green Street Hooligans. Top rated show, highly recommend."
4,Decent entertainment.,"This isn't the best show on tv but its decent entertainment. Its hardcore and I like that. The actors play there parts well. Katy Segal is a far cry from Peg Bundy in this. She's a tough old broad and trashy sexxy at the same time. If your into the biker world at all I think you will enjoy this. Real no, Entertaining yes :-)"
5,greatest show ever created,I am in debt to FX. for the creation of this show. It is finaly a great show for all of the hard core bikers in us all. Not only is it a great nonstop bad to the bone manopera but it has a storyline that flows verry well from the first show to the last. My only regret is that season 2 is not on dvd yet and i must wate till sept for season 3.
5,AWESOME!!!,"I hadn't seen the show before I ordered it, I just thought it looked interesting.... & I was correct! I loved the series & can't wait for the next season to come out!! In Blu-Ray... PHENOMENAL!! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes gritty drama! Thank-You Amazon for a great series at a great price!"
5,loved it,Good visual quality & just a great show. It's not like any other show on. Wonderful casting and fantastic story lines.
4,Surprisingly good,I think its a really good series from start to finish this season will have you hooked. Characters are believable and the plot is fun.
4,Great Show,Watched for the first time and now I am addicted. Beware.Each episode leaves you wanting to see what happens next.
2,In the minority...,"I know people absolutely love this show, but we just couldn't get into it. Maybe it's better in later seasons, but this just isn't for us."
1,Hated this show,"Loaded it on my new Kindle Fire and was looking forward to seeing what everyone is talking about. Watched it on a plane and really wished I downloaded ANYTHING else to watch! This was horribly graphic, ugly and gruesome. If you want nightmares you'll love this garbage."
1,I don't understand,"I want to like it. I really do. But it's SO awful. Charlie Hunam was great in Undeclared. Ron Pearlman was great as Hellboy. Both of them are awful here. The writing is absurd. There's no balance or subtlety to any of it. Every character, both good and bad is one-dimensional. It's just a complete mess. It's a daytime soap disguised as a show about outlaw bikers. The Wire and the Sopranos have set the bar and this show is about 100 miles south. Just inexcusably awful."
4,don't need cable.,I don't have cable and this is a great way to watch as if I'm really watching the series the first year. I watch one episode per week. Every Monday I watch one show and can't wait to watch next week. The dvd arrived in short order. Thank you Amazon.
4,Great show,"Makes me want to buy a harley and cruse the open highway. Good show, great characters and interesting story lines.A must watch if your into a bit of crime slash action."
2,Who am I supposed to root for?,"I give it 2 stars because its done well (shot well, directed, etc) for the type of show it is but who am I supposed to like on the show? The murderers, the dealers, the mother trying to keep her son from getting a better life, the molesters? I agree with the one reviewer, I never get these type of shows. Why should I care if the guy who sends people out to murder a 16 year old girl gets caught? I want him to get caught."
1,Was not what I ordered,"I chose this rating only because I feel like I was lied to. This dvd was not season one, but three episodes from season one. The disc was received in a timely manner and in great condition it just wasn't what I sent for. The ad reads ""Sons of Anarchy: Season One"", I didn't get season One."
5,GREAT DVD SET,"This dvd set was perfect!!! SOA is an awesome show and I am very glad to finally have season 1 in my hands!!! Great price, fast shipping!!! All around a wonderful experience!!!"
5,One of the best shows ever!,When I first saw he previews for this I just didn't get it. I couldn't see what all the hype was about. While I was deployed one of the guys had season one and two with him so I watched them. I was hooked. Drawn in by the excitement of the MC and the drama that come with Clay's bad decisions. This show is one hell of a ride!
4,Great show,I started watching this as pay back for all the chick flicks my husband watches with me. It's a fast paced show with lots of action/ violence. Some of the scenes are a little far fetched but the cast really portrays the characters very well. The suspense leaves you wanting more.
3,fade to black,"Almost done watching the first season. Not sure if it interests me enough to watch the second season. Some of the characters are done well by the actors. I just don't know if I want to see the same acts of violence, sex and drug use for another season. Been there done that."
5,Possible packaging/commentary error,"First off I am a unbelievably huge fan of the show, and I am happy how they did the packaging (4 discs in a standard size DVD case), and the extras are definitely above average, and here is where I ran into something..when you open the case on the inside of the sleeve they put episode listing per discs and what extras appear where. Look at episode 12 The Sleep Of Babies, it clearly indicates a commentary track is available, but the option appears nowhere on the disc, and yes I tried manually adjusting the audio tracks to see if it was somehow hidden..and nothing. So more or less I am wondering is it just a mistake in the reverse side cover print, or a big screw such as completely forgetting to insert it into the DVD. I am sure this will not matter to most folks, but like I said I am a big fan and if there is another commentary track available I would sure like to have it. If anyone come across some info on this it would sure be appreciated. Thanks"
4,Sick collection,This is a definite buy for those of you who know and have watchedthe series... I bought it because my gf got into it in the secondseason so now during the spring slump of tv shows we watch thefirst season... she is loving it and no commercials... and ifyou have watched it before the extras and interviews reallyadd to the whole experience...laterz and keep the rubber side down...C
5,"Up there with ""The Shield""","This series can stand proudly beside ""The Shield"" in terms of quality. The acting is great and the episodes are driven by the characters who are all walking that very thin line of good and evil. Katey Segal as the mother is my favorite, you truly believe she would bite the head off her young without hesitation to preserve the legacy of the Sons of Anarchy. The story whips along with zinger one liners, graphic violence and macho posturing - all adding up to one great ride."
2,Boring,Just finished watching Pilot. Feel like i have wasted my valuable 1 hour on some boring crap. Also its the same thing we have watched in several movies/tv shows before. Nothing new. I wont be watching it further. not my type.
3,Mafia from insite,"A next saga of a criminal family,""a bike sports club"" is a story of a biker gang spreading its influence round the USA and its members' inter-affairs.So far, it would better refrain from commenting the feelings associated with as Occupy Wall Street protest is still around. ""Compulsive Sexual Syndrome"" is an only new stuff I learnt from here."
2,"A few interesting plotlines, but a FAIL nonetheless","This show did something I'd never have expected - had me actually rooting for the cops and the feds to take out this gang of thugs. The main problem is the characters are all such lowlifes that by the end of the second disk, you're wishing for something like a train hauling nuclear waste to crash and take out the whole town. There are zero sympathetic or likable characters, and the ham-handed attempts to demonstrate the ""good qualities"" of the bikers and their cronies are almost laughably transparent.Unlike you're a biker, a big fan of bikers, or someone who really likes stories about white trash thugs and losers, you should probably pass on this one. At least catch a few reruns on cable before you waste your money."
2,Have no idea why this gets good reviews?,"A twelve year old could write the script, poor casting, characters you don't care about.? I'm stumped at how this show has so many good reviews?"
4,Girlfriend thought it was ok..,My girlfriend recently watched the first season because she had it recommended by her parents. She thought it was a decent show but was just too violent for her taste.Loved streaming on the ipad through amazon prime though! So convenient...
5,Good program,"Well written and well acted. Only problem is too many crises. It keeps being said that they are protecting and helping the city, but you never see them doing anything for the city. Just one crisis after another."
5,"Great Show, Great Product",I love this show and Amazon had it at a price for Blu-Ray that was cheaper than other retailers were offering for the standard definition. Arrival was timely and it looks great!
5,One of the best!,"Me and my friends get together every tuesday to watch SOA. I've recommended SOA to others and they got hooked just as much as I have. Definitely the best show on t.v. right now. Season 2 just ended and will be coming to dvd in a bit I imagine, get caught up and get ready for the ride!"
3,"Over-rated, unbelievable, 14 year old fare...","Watched Season 1. Right away, the premise seems unbelievable --- a few gang members running a town and being almost loved and highly respected by many of the townspeople (in California, no less!). Of course, if such occurred, Charming would have few jobs, no outside investment, and a mass exodus of residents.And, indeed, they do seem like fairly nice guys with lots of money and even a sense of civic responsibility.Ride on a motorcycle your whole life and a road accident might do you in. Join a small gang and you might survive if given a life sentence.If they were truly powerful, an FBI agent would likely infiltrate and put the members in jail.Finally, the casting seems wrong. Good looking and strutting like a gangbanger, young Jax and many members do not look very tough and smart --- at least not to me.I wonder what real bikers think of the show? :-)"
3,The show was good but had to have it cleaned up,Package seemed to have never been open but we had to take it to a video store to get scratches removed. We have only watched the first DVD so am not sure on the rest in the series. It was easier for me to get it repaired than send it back. That was my only complaint as it was shipped very fast.
1,Unable to view the video,"The video was very stop and go every few seconds, all the way through. Making viewing it impossible. I have a newer quality laptop as well and I have had no other issues watching video from other sources. This was a waste of money for me."
1,love SOA hate this amazone on demand,"yeah, sons of anarchy is by far the best TV series i have seen in years. i missed episode 13, debated on just downloading it here...glad they give you the free preview. out of sinc, and had to load every 10 secounds. i was wondering if that was just because i didnt download it, but it seems others that did buy it have the same problem. forget amazon on demand, itunes is the same price, and doesn't stink."
2,Product of Desperation,"Not my cup of tea, but maybe something others might want to watch. I mean I found it boring. It just seemed like a group of people who were trying hard to offer a show about choices and crime, but what happened to me was that they ended up with a white trash version of the Sopranos. It was not really new or innovative, just tired and desperate. Maybe you'll like it, but I could imagine that. So make up your mind for yourself."
5,great show,i really enjoyed this series had heard about it and was very glad to get it and view it i'm sure i will watch it more than once
3,Toner Not the Same as Astringent,"As a previous reviewer mentioned (and I did not notice, unfortunately) the title says it's an astringent, but the photo of the bottle reflects it is a toner. Toner and astringent are not the same product. They should change that in the title.My t-zone is like an oil slick for about 10 months of the year so I actually need the ""harsher"" astringent type formula rather than a toner. This might work for me when the weather gets cold (two months or so) so I will try it when the thermometer goes down.But if, like me, you need serious oil control (even just in one area) you might want to look elsewhere, as, so far this product has not done the trick for me and has required multiple applications to control my t-zone trouble at all."
3,Expected a little more,I was a little disapointed with this book..Out of 106 pages it has only 24 that actually describe the lakes in the area. There are over 60 pages of hand drawn maps- that's what topo maps are for. Doesn't mention any streams that are worthwhile. THought it would have had more information.
3,Feels like a missed opportunity...,The book covers a lot of byzantine buildings in Istanbul. Seems like the listing is very accurate and complete. The point is that the description is mostly limited to what can still be seen. I expected deeper historical analysis of the sites. Sometimes the authors quote old sources but it is more about technical details that are not too intriguing...
1,Superficial,"The book provides a broad, general and indeed standardized introduction to Istanbul's Byzantine monuments, essentially a synopsis of more in-depth and relevant publications on the topic."
3,great for practice,"I got my set three weeks ago, been having fun playing with them ever since. The sheathe is very cheap and broke even before i got a chance to practice throwing them. Not really much of a surprise for the price, and even still i enjoy the knives themselves. Very good weight / balance / sharpness. Sticks on targets i made out of hardwood on side of house 8/9 throws. If you are new to throwing knives (which i am not) i recommend these, you can buy 3 sets of three and throw the hell out of them. Heck if you lose or break em, you're only out 30 bucks. Gonna buy some knives that don't have goofy designs etched into them, but i will never throw them all willy nilly like i do these .."
5,Throwing knives,"Nice weight and balance. Good buy for the price, get a few sets and use some for practice and others left pristine for use."
1,is this really cherry?,"This stool, albeit well-made, is DEFINITELY not made from cherry. Maple or birch would be my guess. If you want a cherry stool to match cherry cabinetry, bypass this stool and look elsewhere."
2,"A VERY VERY dry read. However, I passed.","I used three books to help me prepare for the exam. The authors know their subject and reading it should help you. I also read ""All in one CISSP Study Guide"" by Shon Harris. Although studying with any material you can get you hands on is always a good idea, I likely could have simply used Shon Harris's masterpiece, one of the other books that I purchased and not any other books.I found ""The CISSP Prep Guide"" lacking friendly examples and humor which made the book a dry, technical read. It kind of reminded me of the college text books about 16th Century music history. Sleepy and boring. And we all know computer security is more fun then that!Read Harris's book first, Carl Endorf's book second and only this one if you have the time!"
3,"Not bad, but the ""Official"" study guide is better IMO","This book is ok, but I think the book sold by ISC2 is much better. I only used this as a ""supplement"" to the official guide.There are so many CISSP products on the market and I think most of them are BS (i.e. Shon Harris' $1000 review product). Maybe if you know nothing about security and have the choice of a $4,000 boot camp and the Shon Harris $1,000 package, otherwise, get the official guide (about $60) and spend some time reading it. It comes with practice tests in the back and a small test per chapter (most certification books are like this)."
4,Good book for review,"I found the Krutz book well organized and easy to read. It's a great book if you're looking for a review of the ten domains prior to taking the test. I would not recommend it as the only book you would read if you were a new security professional. The test questions at the end of each chapter are good in that they are written in a similiar fashion to the actual exam. Again, very good study book for the experinced professional looking for a fairly comprehensive overview."
5,Thorough Coverage of all CISSP Domains,"I used this book as my primary study source for the CISSP exam, it helped me pass (first time). The coverage of the ten domains is strong and and provides an excellent basis for preparing. The CISSP domain I found hardest to study for was Cryptography - this book provides great 'plain English' coverage of this topic. My only caution would be, that to maximize the chances of passing, it is better to use more than one text / source. Also, like all exams, sufficient practice makes the exam easier."
4,Easy to Read Complete Review,"This book is a great review book. It's easy-to-read. Hits the important points. If you've been working in the industry for a while, this book will do the job."
4,Not too bad - I passed,"I have been doing computer security work for about 5 years now. I used this book, the Exam Cram (which I did not like) and on-line tests to help me prepare. The book could have been better if it had more questions and perhaps a CD to go with it. All in all it was not too bad but I spent an entire day, the day before the exam, going over this book cover to cover. I believe that it put me in the right frame of mind. If you find yourself shakey on any of the 10 Domains, spend extra time on them. I decided that if I could not get 80% or better on an exam for a domain it was time to re-read the chapter. By the way, I did pass the exam in about 3 hours."
3,Good Overview - Poor and Wrong details,"The book presents a short and compact overview of the ten domains for the CISSP exam.What really stroke me is Chapter 3 which talks about ""Telecommunications and Network Security"". It has quite some unprecise and at some points even wrong statements which confuse the reader unnecessarily. There is better material out there which covers these things much nicer (e.g. Building Internet Firewalls, Zwicky).Good to get an overview, but don't solely rely on this book to back you for the exam!"
1,Poorly written outline of facts- don't waste money or time,"Absolutely dreadful presentation of material. Glaring mistakes, examples are generally short, confusing, and consequentially meaningless. Too many typos cause frustration while reading...My advice can be easily summed up in only two words:DON'T BUY!!!!!"
4,Best available so far!!,"...Anyhow, it really isn't necessary because this is a very good book. I am a CISA and a security consultant for a large firm, and I can say that this will be of great benefit for those of you studying the CISSP. At first glance, I don't think it can be your only study material, but it will get you very close. For [the] list price, I would have liked to have seen a study CD or such like most other guides priced much cheaper than this, but if you can get it for... less, it is money well spent."
4,we will see how the test goes,I have to say it is nice to have a nice guideline for studying for this exam. I will say the questions seem too easy. The book is well organized and flows very well. I found very few mistakes grammatically/technically which was a nice change of pace from some some others that discuss the basic outline of the CBK.
2,False Assertion,"This book purports to be the only one you'll need for CISSP, and that's just plain wrong. I read it completely, yet saw questions on the test from material that was simply not covered in this book. It's not badly written, just not adequate. My suggestion is to try the All-In-One Guide, or SOME OTHER BOOK."
2,Poor editing makes it nearly unreadable,"This may be a great reference, but I've noticed six typos by page five - they are a mounting distraction. Perhaps the information content is credible, but the horrid presentation makes the authors appear untrustworthy."
3,A disappointment.,"I already have my CISSP and I purchased this book for the ISSEP content. I think the writing is miserable. It looks like the author simply copied and pasted contents from the referenced government documents. Yes, the information is there. No, it is not a ""fun"" read like Shon Harris' book. Wait for the third edition of Shon's book - I'm sure it will be much better."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"Stay away from this book. It is the worst book that I have ever read. The authors use abstract terms to explain the abstract terms, making it extremely difficult for the readers to understand. If you already know the stuff, you probably don't need this book. If you don't, then reading it will not help at all!From an MSC and MCSE (Win2K track)."
5,It worked for me,"I Passed the CISSP exam using this book and Carl Endorf's CISSP Study Guide. If I can do it, anyone with a little experience (mine is in IPSec and firewalls) can pass the exam using these two books."
4,We Enjoyed It,"My kids didn't want to see it at first. 4 boys between the ages of 4-13. However, we all enjoyed it!"
4,Fun and entertaining,I look a good animation film every now and again and this is a fun one to rent for the Halloween season.
4,Paranorman,Wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but still cute. I was worried the zombies busting out of their grave was too much for my son but he seemed fine. I however don't think it was good for him to try and grasp the concept that the little girl had been hung to death so if I knew that I wouldn't have let him watch it.
5,Loved it,Rented this movie cause I am a coraline fan. This movie was just as good I Loved it. I would watch it again.
4,I don't have kids but,"some of the innuendos would probably make some parents a bit annoyed. I mean, as someone in their early 20s I found the movie silly-funny. Think Adventure Time sort of jokes- ""i'll punch you in the boobs"", ""i don't have boobs, i have pectorials.....ow my boobs"". Or my favorite ""mr. pendergrass appeared to me in the bathroom""...""ew""..""no not like that..""It isn't as dark as Coraline, gets slightly gross (had me say ew a few times) but isn't too scary for say 9 yr olds.Film note: NOT related to Tim Burton. I know when people think stop motion he comes to mind. Also the stop motion is very smooth, don't think of Nightmare Before Christmas."
2,Should not be rated PG,"Most PG rated movies are appropriate for smaller kids, but this one was not, it was scary for my kids, and had a lot of inappropriate lingo/behavior. I didn't think the plot was really that great either, just kind of so-so. I enjoyed Coraline, but even that movie is a little scary too for the younger crowd. I would recommend this for kids older than 8 I think."
4,saving stop-motion one movie at a time,"beautiful movie. THIS is how you keep stop motion alive. unbelievable, check out the making of video's on the official site, really awesome.great 'acting', lighting , really attractive character designs, and the sets were really nice. the art of book will be on the christmas list.the homosexuality thing, i think the problem some have are that most parents want to address sexuality on their own terms and in this case it was a bit of a surprise. if you don't want to get into that with your kids, maybe pass on it, if you don't care, you will probably really enjoy the film.overall it's a fantastic product, (neil steals the show) if you're an artist, you have to see this. it's a great artistic achievement."
2,Below average,Movie was just boring and below average. Only funny parts were in the previews and it wAs even a little dark at times...
3,Too scarey for the youngsters,I got this movie for movie night with my 6 yr old granddaughter. In about the middle of the movie she said it was freaking her out and that we should find another movie.As for myself I liked it and continued to watch it the next day by myself.
5,Best Kids Horror Movie Ever,"I absolutely love this move! I saw it twice in the theater when it was first released, so I had to buy it once it was out on DVD/Blu-ray. It's a fantastically done kids ""horror"" movie that adults will love! I watch it frequently and it never gets old! Nothing too scary for the little ones so it's a movie the whole family can enjoy."
2,Not PG,As a mother I was appalled this movie was rated PG. It was a good movie (but should be rated PG13) I can't believe I let my 3 and 6 year old watch it!!
1,No way this is PG,There's no way this movie should be PG. This had a lot of violence and a lot of for gore. This should be PG-13 at a minimum.
3,Would be OK for some kids.,"It was an OK movie, but not one for the whole family, unless you are at the stage of liking Saturday morning cartoons with the kids. Graphics were OK."
3,Heartwarming in a weird way,It takes the arrival of the undead to help mankind realize that their vicious groupthink behavior is despicable. Norman is a child who is gifted in that he can see and communicate with the dead. One day a huge task falls into his lap when he discover the return of his town's curse is a package deal that includes a witch as well. A fun watch and a great moral lesson to boot.
2,Thumbs down,"Kind of a depressing peace of work. Don't like it. Boring, lack of colors, just not a fan of this kind of animation. My kids don't get it."
2,Not what I would have picked for kids,"I bought this movie in time for halloween for 3 boys (ages 6-8) to watch. Being that it's a cartoon, I figured it would be a little scary, but more of a fun scary and age appropriate. I was wrong. There were some bad words (not a lot, but surprising for a cartoon nonetheless). Very scary with the zombies and dark material...all three boys were on top of me begging to turn it off. I should have rented rather than purchased."
5,Great Movie!,A very enjoyable movie and the stop-motion animation is incredible! We're rather disappointed we didn't see it in the theatres!
3,It's cute,A decent renter - the animation is excellent as is the voice work. The story's a bit of a stretch but great for the cost. Kids loved it.
3,"More like 3.5...Good, not great.","Excellent artistically and visually appealing/distinctive, fun premise with some wonderful voice actors but somehow not doing it for me. Definitely worth renting but I doubt I'd buy it (and my 9 and 10 year old agreed). I can't put my finger on what was ""off"" exactly but it just didn't have that ""it"" factor...and on a side note, I didn't think the homosexual comment was inappropriate and in anyway offensive and frankly, I'm surprised people are so prudish that they feel uncomfortable discussing such topics with their children (only to the degree befitting their age and comprehension, mind you)."
4,ParaNorman,"NOT BAD,it could have been better, for kids this is a great film ,to show how to get along with one another,if ghost or not!"
5,Great little flick,What a great little flick an amazing message! Cute funny and makes ya think!! The characters are well developed! Makes a great family night!!
3,Its ok,As always the commercials are better than the movie. It was ok but could have been done a bit better.
2,Not good for young children,Some parts a bit scary for some children under 7 as well as some adult situations some parents might also feel are inappropriate.
5,ParaNorman,"This is a great movie! The more I watch this movie, the more I love it. There are soooooooooooo many subtle little references/comments made throughout the movie that we parents would pick up, but would go right over the heads of our children. There are some scary parts in the movie, but overall the movie is very tame and children of all ages would enjoy it. It also provides a good lesson that all of our children need to learn at a very early age!!!"
3,Good ending,"The ending had a very good message but it too long to get there. I wish the BIG brother hadn't been so ""stupid."" That, ultimately, sends a bad message."
4,...but not for little kids.,"If you have an early teen who is open minded, likes sci-fi and fantasy, and even a bit nerdy, this is a cool movie. It teaches that you should not judge by just sight or what you've seen in the movies. 'Get the full story before you act.' But it's really not for the little kids. It will scare them even though it'll lead to a happy ending. Best played at Holloween."
5,Not for the kiddies.. more like the kids at heart.,It's quite a touching and very good simple film. Character designs were really well thought-out.The cover might look like a fun kids-type light scary film but in reality it's not. More for teens and adults stuff.
3,Surprisingly different...,"Glad we didn't see this one in the theaters - too scary for my sensitive 8 yr old, although the scary stuff was balanced with enough laughs for my 12 yr old to enjoy it. As the name implies, this movie is ripe full of ghosts, zombies, witches and other scary stuff. Also, the biggest surprise to be aware of - one of the main characters reveals that he is gay at the end of the movie. I don't have any problem with that, but just be aware that you might need to answer some questions that you weren't prepared for when simply viewing a children's movie!"
3,Kids Liked It,"It was OK, My kids loved it. My wife and I have seen better but it was entertaining and we really just got it for the kids."
4,"Wonderful animation, intelligent story, and both funny/dramatic in all the right places!","In his small, sleepy town Norman is seen as a bit of a freak; a young boy who talks to himself, seems a bit of a nerd, and therefore has no friends and spends a great deal of his time alone. But Norman isn't talking to himself - he's talking to ghosts, specters he's been able to see, especially, since the death of his grandma (who talks to him regularly at home, often keeping Norman company as he watches TV). Even his own parents and self-absorbed teenage sister don't believe him - think him odd - but when his ability to communicate with the dead calls Norman into service against an oncoming supernatural uprising that threatens his entire town, Norman gathers a few rag-tag buddies to vanquish the undead and break a centuries-old curse ... in what is a truly engaging, funny, and surprisingly good animated film complete with a few twists to the plot you do NOT see coming. Even the animation looks cool."
3,Worth seeing at least once,"I liked this, but it isn't something that I'll watch over and over again. It is must see at least once."
3,It's okay...,"It was cute but ultimately... there was nothing new to see here, very little depth and underwhelming during the ""big moments""."
3,fun,"Fun movie with an okay plot, decent dialogue and awesome visuals. The story suffers from heavy handedness and tries too hard to deliver a message."
2,Rent this movie,"Another movie that was OK, should have never bought the DVD. I will never watch this a second time. I will learn someday that the previews always look good but the content does not always produce entertainment."
3,It was ok,The movie was pretty good. I thought it would be a little better. It did seem to have some inappropriate language in it for children. And I didn't like the way it was made that much.
2,Some of the effects were good,"Generally, the story was lame and predictable. Definitely would be for children between 6 and 11 years old. A real time waster."
2,Not for me,Interesting storyline.Loved the big brother.The characters bodies were created too distorted for me.There were some very funny LOL clipsSubtitles a plus.In spite of all the pro's I simply didn't care for it.
4,Worth the watch,The story was not quite what I expected but it was not bad and I do want to see it again.
4,ZOMBIES ARE PEOPLE TOO.,"Norman sees and talks to dead people. He is tasked to stop the curse of the town's witch trail from centuries ago. In his school, kids who talk to dead people get bullied. The characters are stereotypical.The beginning of the movie has a spoof of ""B"" zombie films that was very clever, down to the boom mike making it into the picture. I enjoyed this movie more than the famous Tim Burton productions. While there is nothing wrong in this film per se, there are some things parents might want to know. In one sentence, belief in life after death is equated to belief in astrology. Also the hot guy liked by teen Courtney mentions his boyfriend, shades of ""Call Me Maybe.""The people who killed the young witch were wrong, they were considered simply afraid. There are no religious elements associated with the witch trial.If I was gong to improve this film, I would of had Betty White play grandma and written her character appropriately. Comedian Jeff Garlin as the dad did a great voice."
4,Fun,While it wasnt our favorite animated film of all time we are still glad we went to see this movie. Some slow spots but over all it was funny and the kids had a good time. Id watch it again and so would they!
1,did not play,"rented the movie on the Amazon to watch over the internet, however it would not play, it may not be Amazon's fault, maybe my smart TV not being very smart......we did not try customer service yet to fix the issue"
1,Inappropriate Not a Family Movie,This movie had so many Adult themes I am not even sure how this can be sold as a family movie. What is the point of adding all of that to the movie?Language and the Lords name in vain were also throughout the movie.This was a great disappointment.
1,Thumbs down : (,"We found the movie to be a disappointment. 'Sad to see poor values acted out by main characters throughout. Even though obviously fiction, it manages to promote very realistic positive spins on moral-less behavior. As a result we chose not to show ParaNorman to our family. Could have been a fun flick."
1,Scary for kids and too dark.,I did not expect it to be so scary for kids. Wish there was a warning saying too dark and frightening.
4,Para Norman was a cute movie. I have 5 g-children and we all watched it together. Definitely entertaining for the whole family,I normally don't like to watch cartoon type shows but this was very entertaining. Ages 4 to 62 watched it all togetheer. I've even watched it again.
4,Great kids movie,"Great movie to watch with the kids. Loved the animation and the story line. A little slow in some parts,but all around good movie."
3,The Commercials were the best part,"this movie is just OK, glad I rented it instead of spending $10. I was hoping for more, the commercials were good, the movie is OK, should have been better"
1,Not for kids,"I'm pretty reasonable with what my 3 and 7 year old girls watch. We even watch James Bond movies occasionally. I have to say, this was not the family movie I thought it would be after watching the trailer."
2,Nothing exciting,Nothing exciting. Has references that younger kids may not understand. This is one of those movies you only watch once.
2,not a kids movie,I thought that the language in this movie is not appropriate for smaller kids. I also didn't like all the bullying in it.
2,Definately a kid's show,"Unless you have young kids that want to watch a show with a paranormal twist, then I suggest you look elsewhere for you entertainment."
4,Fun Time,While it seems that there is a never ending stream of movies that advocate that being different is a good thing... it is fun to see how they do it. Tried and true theme.
2,Rather boring.,I expected more. I think the best parts were in the previews. Animation was good though. Not much else to say.
2,It was a let down,"The story line was good, but it wasn't as humorous and creative as I expected it to be. I was just ok."
5,Wonderfully entertaining.,"""ParaNorman"" is a wonderful jewel of a movie. The character development, the filming, and the historical settings are all just perfect. And there is some lesson in it, too, for our paranoid Fundamentalist friends who are afraid of everything they cannot understand."
2,nice graphics...but....,"This animated feature isn't sure who the audience is, if you ask me. I'm assuming it's one of those that are supposed to appeal to both adults and children, but it doesn't live up to ""Shrek"" standards. For me, it was a bit tedious, although it beat watching reruns or yet another inane reality show. For children, I'd be careful letting younger kids watch. Some of the scenes would be really scary to a young child."
2,Bored my daughter,"My 3yo daughter thought it was boring and gave up half way through. Granted she really loves princess movies, but I thought I would give it a try. Not so much."
5,Very Cute,"This was a very cute movie, probably not for children under the age of 5 as the colors and music of this could still potentially scare them but i thought this was really good :-)"
3,"Cute movie, but where was the 3D?","I thought the moral of the story was appropriate with all the bullying going on in schools. I was reading other reviews about the gay references, and I had no idea what they were talking about. You mean the part at the end where the attractive jock isn't into the blonde chick because he has a boyfriend? This is 2013 people, your kids are eventually going to find out what homosexuality is.I bought the movie instead of renting it for the 3D aspect...I didn't see any 3D effects. Even with the glasses off, the screen was similar to a regular blu-ray."
3,For older kids,It was a little scary so maybe not good for children under 7 or 8. Took a minute to get used to the claymation but good story. Some inappropriate inuendos not suitable for children.
3,Kind of a let down,"While cute, the plot tended to drag along. Additionally, I don't think the creative writers thought the whole plot scenario out very well. Where kids might find this fun and spooky (or whatever)--adults will be left scratching their heads. I expected more."
3,Story line lacking,"Great for kids to pass the time, but the story line over all was lacking. Stick with Pixar movies for a better family experience."
1,Read Leviticus 19:31,"Flee from evil.More lies produced to inculcate our children, from the father of lies. The Bible tells us that when we ""speak to the dead"" we actually talk to demons/fallen angels. Don't be deceived. Leviticus 19:31 is but one of many instructions against necromancy. ""Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God."""
1,Boys did not like it,My 5 and 8 year old boys were scared and ran out within the first 5 minutes and me and my 13 year old daughter ended watching it and did not enjoy the movie.
2,Too complicated,"Story line was much too difficult to follow. Graphics, voices, etc. were good, however, as a story the title was better than the show."
2,Not for Children. Completely ruined by inappropriate content.,"The stop motion animation was stunning , which accounts for one star. The actual overall story arc: fantastic; one more star. But that is it. All ruined by too many crass and tasteless moments.I was bothered by the way several of the characters were dressed/created with obvious sexual overtones. Too much adult humor and not enough playfulness. In fact, in the opening scene, Norman's mother asked him what he was up to and he replied, ""Watching sex and violence"". Really??? Personally, I wouldn't let any kid under the age of 12 to it. If you are planning on letting young kids watch, please read the parent's guide. And honestly, that didn't really paint a picture of how inappropriate some of the content is. I was extremely disappointed."
3,Good movie,Good movie but could done without the gay reference toward the end of the movie. While it may not bother some I just don't feel I need to have a sexual preferences discussion with my 10 yr old after a movie aimed toward kids.
3,"Not great for young kids, i would say kids ages 10+","Not great for young kids, very scary to my 4 & 7 year old. Appropriate for kids over the age of 10"
3,Maybe for the kids?,"Maybe I'm too old for kids shows? Naaaw. UP was one of my faves and Pumba's my BFF. This was an okay movie - just not one that I'll bother to recommend to friends, for their kids, or other adults who still enjoy kids movies."
3,Good,"Could have been better but still was enjoyable. Action was pretty well paced and the story line was ok...zombies could have been more aggressive. Yeah I know, I know; not that kind of movie, still they could have been a little less wimpish."
2,Boring and drawn out,Would have been a good story line but it got too serious and just wasn't as much fun as it could have been
2,A little scary for little ones and inappropriate references,"This was too scary for my 6 year old and some of the references were too adult. I typically like animated films, but this one not so much."
4,Solid Movie,"The movie was good, but our video stream stopped with about five minutes remaining so we actually didn't get to see the very end of the movie."
2,Pressure to love this movie???,I find it rather amusing that people are getting upset with those of us who did not like this movie. I am starting to wonder if all the 5 star reviews are from people who worked on the film.I do give high regards to the animators. This movie contains some of the best animation I've ever seen but the story just couldn't keep me riveted to my seat or even curious as to what was going to happen next. I actually had to apologize to my wife and kids for making them sit through this.I recommend before anyone listens to the high reviews that they rent it and decide for themselves. Don't feel pressure to buy because people are claiming it's the best movie of 2012.I would watch it with an open mind and not be pressured to love it because people are commenting that there must be something wrong with you if you don't.
2,Sad,I dont like to see a subject like this in animation. I rented it for my grandkids but this is not a kids movie! Too heavy!
4,Great in 3D!,This movie is funny and it is great in 3D. I saw it in the theater and couldn't wait to get it for watching it in the comfort of my home.
5,Great Family movie,I didn't think I was going to like it but it was a really good movie about bullying.Great storyline.
4,Cute,"Your kids might actually be scared by this movie. Besides that, it was a very entertaining movie. Definitely worth the rental price."
4,More zombies!,Saw the movie with my grandaughter. She was 4 and really didn't understand the scarier parts but really laughed at some parts too-where he kissed the wrong of the dog
3,"Cute, kids movie",it is cute with little moral lessons and funny in parts. Grandkids loved it and I enjoyed it. eas not bored like some kids movies.
4,paranorman,"my kids love it, i enjoyed it as well. the movie was funny, kid scray, and sad but had a good story line to it"
4,A homage to zombie and horror with a guffaw,"Paranorman is NOT a small children's movie. I would not take anyone under 12 to this movie. There are some scary moments about a young boy who sees the dead and can communicate with them. There are some colorful characters in this roller coaster ride of a movie. In the end, it is more of a psychological horror film than a spoof."
2,Not sure what audience the makers were aiming for,"Thinking this was a cartoon aiming for a young audience, I decided to rent and see what it was about. The story is an average one if not a little slow and boring. My biggest issue with this movie is I am not sure what audience it is aiming for. It seems a big scary for young children and not so entertaining for the older ones or even adults. I am not sure I would recommend watching if you have small kids as the imagery might cause nightmares."
2,Ok,We found this movie to be a little scary for our kids. With the zombies and the creepy witch... it was just all a bit too much.
3,Quirky,"We had a mix of kids and adults watch. Some of us really liked it, but some did mot at all. It is a mix of horror movie and humor that will not resonate with everyone."
1,Boring,I fell asleep watching this. It just didn't grab my attention at all. The characters lacked inspiration and didn't seem to have a uniqueness that could be attributed to them...seemed like a run-of-the-mill animation.
1,Worst movie,This is a really really really bad movie for kids. I do not recommend it. I story is really hard to follow with a lot of innuendoes.
1,The 8 to 10 yr old movie not for them or adults,"The 3d is awful especially considering anime really shows off the media. I Robot jumps off the screen compared to this production. The story itself is totally geared towards 8 yr olds but the innuendo makes it very very marginal even for todays kids. The script is really boring. I will stop here because I have run out of nice things to say about this movie. I did not buy this from Amazon but I am a big fan, I got it today from a local brick and mortar store with coupons I would really be upset if i paid $25 or $ 30 for this trash."
1,Never saw Norman,"I was unable to view this film at all, saw not 5 minutes before it was cut off, kept crashing on me"
1,Was not impressed,I didn't make it past 5 min and didn't approve of the content. He told his mom he was watching sex and violence!Not impressed! Returned it and got a refund!
2,Paranorman,"Paranorman has its moments - but sadly without the minds of Tim Burton (James and the giant peach- Corps Bride,Frankenweenie),or Henery Selick (Nightmare before Christmas -Coraline) THE MOVIE LACKS HEART.This was well animated in some parts but looks rushed to make a fast buck.I love stop motion animation from King Kong to Frankenweenie but VERY SADLY this is a movie to skip because it is nothing like what we have seen in stop motion in the past-sloppy."
2,Ehh... So-so.,"I expected more from the animators who did the Coraline adaptation, but then the story/script this time was not taken from a fine, dark Neil Gaiman story.Brilliant technical achievement in the animation, but everything else is recycled clichés: The Sixth Sense, Frankenstein, Night of the Living Dead/generic zombie flicks, car chases, grade-school bromance, even a dash of Beetlejuice.The action is s-l-o-w, the story meandering and full of dated pop-culture references, characters somewhat grotesque (not just the zombies) and confined to narrow stereotypes, and the PC/GA burden heavy-handed and tedious.Unlike the Coraline movie, I would not view ParaNorman again nor recommend it to others."
3,I had high hopes.,"I really wanted this movie to be something special. I'm a fan of the Tim Burton stop-motion films, this was not that. It didn't have that special feeling. The Nightmare Before Christmas felt like it happened in a real alternate reality, it felt big. ParaNorman felt like it happened in a shoe box.It was an okay story, just watch out if you have young children, this movie can be scary. It's sad too."
2,Not a good movie at all and really not for young kids.,Boring with a wired ending even for a animated movie. This is not a movie for young children. Just bad
2,Too scary for my little ones/,My boys ages six and four were scared of the zombies. For older children maybe 8 years old and older.
2,boring,"i found this movie very boring, also no real humor , frankly not worth the 3.99 it cost me to rent it"
2,"I Guess This Is the New Normal, Beware","I Guess This Is the New Normal, BewareThe movie was filmed well the technical aspects were top notch. However it was very crude and tasteless throughout."
5,Surprisingly good animated film,"My wife and I don't watch many animated films now that our kids have been launched. But this one caught our attention and we watched it and are glad we did. The story line was fantastical, but the film used those unusual props to reveal human character and the film made both of us cry at times. The animation was stop action, which made the characters appear very lifelike in terms of facial expressions, unlike most computer graphics. And it was a lot of fun. It would be a great family movie, although I don't recommend watching it with very young children, say under 10 as parts of it are too scary for minds that can't readily distinguish fantasy from reality."
3,ok movie :/,"some of the content was inappropriate for kids, and completely unnecessary to the film. that being said it was an ok film..."
4,The more I watch it the more I like it.,"My kid has watched it repeatedly, thus, so have I. I like it quite a bit. I basically listened to it and read while the kids watched, but as they keep putting it in, I get more and more interested. I think it's pretty good."
2,Don't bother,I watched this with my 12 year old son and we both agreed it was disturbing. The movie was about a 10 year old girl who was murdered by adult men who thought she was a witch...kid movie????
2,Surprisingly disappointed,I was surprisingly disappointed in the movie. It was okay for two adults to watch but I imagine it would be quite scary for a child. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends with kids.
5,Loved it,My son loved getting this for Christmas. We didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters and was thrilled to open it Christmas morning.
3,It's okay,"Coraline was much better. The animation was good, the story was good, but nothing really jumped out at me with this movie."
5,ParaNorman,"I thought the story line was good but it's very dark and I think a little scary for young children. It's about a town a lot like Salem with a curse on it and the man that has kept the curse from happening for many years dies and Norman has to take over. The caricatures are well done, and comical I just don't think it's appropriate for small children."
3,good animation,This movie has a good plot. The story is not as engaging but if you are lookign for something for the kids to watch with their friends- it's ok... as long ast they are not scared of zombies- lol
3,"Surprisingly complex story, but never really grabs","Take ""the Sixth Sense"" and every New England/Salem Witch Trial story you've ever heard, whirl in a blender until smooth, and you've got this film. Decent story, fun visuals, lots of physical humor--and zombies!"
4,Kids liked it and so did the aduts,Its kinda preachy at times but funny and fun for whole family. Some parts are kinda scary at first so be carefull if your kids are too young.
3,Cute Kids Movie,The movie was cute. Had a good story line to it. If you have a young child then you should definitely watch this!
3,Kid-friendly zombie movie,"This is an okay movie. It is cute in some parts, somewhat suspenseful in others, but not really funny. The one thing I really did like about the movie was the zombies themselves. They were actually sympathetic towards the end. I say all of this from the perspective of an adult who still enjoys cartoons. If I were a kid, I probably would have really enjoyed this. Definitely not for kids under the age of 5."
3,"the movie was great, the streaming not so much.","the movie was adorable and quirky if a bit predictable but I think it would have been more enjoyable if I had been able to watch it all in one go. It stuttered, backed up stopped for ten minutes and came back on after a low quality loading bar and then near the end just sat there frozen for a minute before starting again at a point ten minutes prior to where it had frozen up. Streaming movies have been out a long time guys, it shouldn't be that bad."
3,Not for young kids,Not for young kids. My 5 year old was frightened. My 9 year old enjoyed it. It was a macabre and dealt with child murder.
2,Did not fit my needs,"These did not suit my needs. If you intend to use them the same way that I tried using them, then I recommend you don't buy these. Here is how I had planned on using them.As I read, sometimes I encounter words that I do not know. When this happens I stop, write the word down, then continue reading. A friend had suggested getting these arrow flags and sticking it to the word, so I would not have to break my flow of reading. Here is what I found.1. In some books the arrow's adhesive will pull the text off of the page. The ink sticks to the adhesive. No good.2. Lets say I mark 10 words. After I am done reading, to go back and find all of the arrows seems like more work than just stopping reading, and writing the word down right then.For other purposes I'm sure these arrows are great. Keep in mind that I am rating the product in relation to this specific purpose.Thank you for reading my review! :)"
5,Does what it's supposed to,Love my post-its. I use them nowadays primarily for pointing to interesting ideas in the Talmud as I do Daf Yomi. They are ok to use and especially useful on Shabbat for this purpose.
4,Mark of the Succubus Vol. 1,"This is a very interesting opening to a new series that will definitely catch your attention. With a tragic love you can just see will play itself out, it promises to be an amazing series all manga fans should follow."
4,great buy,I love cavelli and the smell of this cologne is great. Plus I got it at a good price. I still use it after two years.
2,Poor customer service,"The cologne is good, but my main complaint is that the damn cologne took too long to arrive. What a horrible customer service provided by Amazon... Why im not surprised???!"
3,From Muckrakers Day to Parades,"From Smother Magazine - [...]Louisville, Kentucky has had a ""Muckrakers Day"" as proclaimed by the mayor after about 800 people showed up for a pre-release concert there. AAA pop-rock band The Muckrakers are still getting used to all the attention. With ""Front of the Parade"" they continue down the well traveled road of musical influences with Barenaked Ladies, Matchbox 20, and Crowded House among their inspirations. The music is riddled with pop hooks and was produced by Todd Smith whose previous work has included Smash Mouth and Days of the New. The Muckrakers are fine alternatives to what is plaguing modern pop radio today."
4,Hadji Murat,This book well written. The story of Hadji's attempt to get his family returned fromanother Russian warlord. He goes to the Russian army which is looking for him and turns himself in to see if they would help him get his family released. In long attempts. Wonderful sstory.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"The book arrived in a very fast manner. However, I received the wrong book! I was excited when I made my purchase. The seller claimed to have a rare-out of print- book that was not advertised domestically or internationally. I am a college student currently engaged in reseach. I will be presenting at a national conference next year (2011) and the book I thought I was purchasing was important to my formative research. To say the least, I was DISAPPOINTED when the wrong book arrived at my doorstep. Not to mention, the book was expensive. Now I have to pay to send the book back to the seller, a book I NEVER asked for, and wait for my refund. Disappointed indeed."
3,This movie is ok,I have read a lot of books on this case and remember when this murder took place. I was 2 years younger than Martha and have always been intrigued.The movie was ok. I thought the charactors were well portrayed although it almost made you feel sorry for Michael. I wanted to know more about him.There was a lot of key elements not mentioned in the movie too. It might have been better if it was longer.
2,way too slow,"The whole movie centers around the mystery of one girls death, and the on going investigation into what really happened. I had to try very hard not to fall asleep, and watched it with someone else who did fall asleep. This movie is just one big production to give Mark Ferman a big pat on his back for opening up this case to the public eye. If you like long drawn out mysteries, then maybe this is for you, if your looking for a true murder story with a little more interest/action, get vampire clan, Fargo, or Bundy. I gave it 2 stars for what blood and action it did have, which wasn't much. eliminate that one scene, then it is a one!"
3,Scratched the surface,Very well done. Logically laid out and easy to use. CD-ROM attachment is very helpful.I found myself skipping the profiles and going straight to the sites and am disappointed that the number of sites are limited . . . of course they are only profiling the best. It does cover a very broad number of topics.A good effort but they barely scratched the surface. I had a better time working the link lists at major sites.
1,Worst product ever,"What can you say about a product that simply doesn't work? Run away, RUN AWAY! Don't waste your time. In spite of shaking it and following the directions, it just...doesn't...work. No correction fluid comes out. I can hear liquid sloshing around inside, but it won't flow through the tip.If there were a 0-star rating, this product would warrant it."
3,So you want to get a turtle..,"On Friday, March 30, about 7:45 in the evening, my life changed dramatically. My daughter in law gave me a red eared slider turtle. Along with the turtle, came this book. The book is better than nothing, and certainly gives a long range picture of what to expect if keeping the turtle for the duraction of it's life. but I felt that the beginning stages of the animal's life cycle was far too brief. There needs to be a book that centers on very first steps with these animals. I've been a wreck for almost four weeks, becuase I still dont feel I have enough information to know what I'm doing well enough. I do not recommend this book as a single source. Only as one of many on turtles, if in fact others exist. I do applaud the author on stressing that turtles are not toys, let alone suitable pets for small children. Also, the part about keeping the turtle warm, which I am still fighting even with a reptile light."
4,Red-Eared Sliders: From the Experts at Advanced Vivarium Systems,This book is very informative I think it is a good read for beginner turtle owners. I received the book surprisingly very fast and the price was reasonable
5,great guide for beginners,Book worked well for my kids who were beginners in the area of raising red eared sliders. Good information as the kids had the turtles for a few years and then were able to put them in a more natural environment. Adapted well and are still going strong!
3,Decent quality mats - wrong sized grommet,"The mats were the correct size and fitment, but the grommet for mat peg to keep it in place is about 3x the size it should be. It doesn't snap down or anything, just loose lays over it. If I would have known about this I would have purchased another brand. Aside from that though the quality seems good for the price."
5,Great!,Bought this for my fiance's G35 coupe. Its a perfect fit.Good quality so far (ony about 2 months) and much more affordable than the $200 competition.I think this will last at least 5 years and you can bet I'll be looking for a set for my Camry soon.
3,Do not stack,"These bowls look very nice, but one thing to keep in mind is that they do not stack. Four of these bowls start to take up a lot of storage space, compared to bowls with curved sides that stack more compactly. If you have endless cabinet space, these are great. If you're like most of the world and your kitchen cabinets are already packed full, these will only make that problem worse."
2,Broken in Shipping!,"The salad bowls sure look nice, but they were broken in shipping - three times! Barely any packaging material was used."
3,swear in six languages!,"A small dictionary, but there are those who love it. The IDO explains -- in English that is, to say the least, not shy -- all the filthiest language from Spanish, Italian, French, German and Russian. It is sort of unsettling to see all these curses and dirty words in a sterile dictionary column. Once you get past that initial weirdness, though, the dictionary will be a shameless joy to thumb through. It is true that insults and foul words are the funniest parts of a language, so if for nothing else you should look into this book as a humor piece."
3,Too big,"The map was quite legible, and seemed accurate. But it was very unwieldy, due to its large size. Trying to unfold and fold it in a small car just didn't work."
4,"As noted in other reviews, a good planning map.","The level of detail in this map tempts you to think that it may be all you need - but only if you're sticking to the fairly major roadways. There are a lot of the small short country lanes represented - but determining which one you're on or which one you need can be a challenge when the road signs only list towns too small to be on the map. And definitely do not assume that you can successfully navigate the intricate windings of Edinburgh using the inset map here. That said, it was a very handy general planning and orientation tool and not as unweildy in the car as its overall size might indicate - you can usually open just a couple of folds that show the area of interest."
4,It's got it all!,"This map has all the detail you will want on a trip through the Scottish Highlands.And it's fine for the car, just need to fold it appropriately."
5,Beautiful Wine Cooler/Great Price,"Received my wine cooler last week....absolutely love it...it looks great, holds 8 bottles of wine, just enough for me...definitely recommend this product for the price...very stylish:)"
1,Ridiculous,"I have to say first it was very pretty and lightweight. However, the wine bottles would not fit in the middle,they fit on the sides but in the back where the fan is sticks out far enough that the wine tops stuck out just enough that the door would not close. most wine bottles have slightly longer necks,especially the newer ones,so if that's the type of wine you have beware that they will not fit in the cooler!"
4,silent,Looks a good product its very silent and and the temperature is there. I will suggest it to other people
4,worth it,I purchased this about 5 months ago and it has been performing very well. It sits on the kitchen counter and is quite. Just keep in mind that it only fits standard wine bottles. You can fit fatter bottles if you remove the pull out tray but it is perfect for the standard bottles. It is worth the money and will last for a long time.
3,Good Manual,The manual was new...except for some dog-eared pages at the bottom of said pages. The cost was great...the book was in better shape than I was expecting. The reason I gave the seller three stars is for his choice of shipping. It took over three week to arrive by USPS. Even then...the online tracking kept saying during all this time the book was sitting in the office which was supposed to ship it. I understand this was the problem with USPS...but I was moving and needed the book to be shipped in a faster manner than USPS could. This is one of the biggest reasons the other two shipping companies can do this better than the USPS. Ordered something else a week after this from another seller and got that shipment two weeks before I got this one. This was the longest I have ever waited for anything to arrive.
3,Not sure what happened.,"They said it was in stock when I paid for it, but refunded my money a week later, due to being out of stock."
1,Rip-Off,"I was ripped-off. The item never arrived. I attempted to file a complaint with Amazon.com but never had any reply. I want the world to know about my experience and I may never purchase another thing from Amazon. Sincerely, Thomas Miller"
4,A good item to have for a do it yourself'er...,"I will admit I am no Mechanic. But, that is exactly why this book comes in handy. This book has great ""General"" information to help take apart and replace many components. With that being said, if you have experience working on/with vehicles, you probably will not gain a whole lot out of a book like this. I can see how someone with considerable knowledge with mechanics wouldn't gain much from owning this piece of information. However, for someone like me, with very limited experience, this definitely has served as a resource. That and fullsizebronco.com, haha."
5,no complaints,"I have used chiltons manuals on every vehicle I have owned. this was no different, clear instructions and diagrams.I do however recommend getting a haynes and chiltons manual...usually each one leaves out important steps that the other has and vice versa."
4,great condition; quick delivery,"Received quickly and in very good condition. Have used already, and it's a big help. The instructions are brief and not extremely detailed, so you have to have some prior ability to construe general guidelines. But enough of what you really need is there to assist with repairs and diagnostics, which is what I was looking for."
1,Chilton continues to be a seething hotbed of mediocrity,"I have ""shade tree'd"" my way through over 40 years of Haynes, Chilton and Motor repair manuals. Chilton has gone from being a moderately good reference source for technical data in the early 60's to a few hundred sheets of disposable shop rags. The offering in question has an almost complete lack of diagnostic information, and is nothing more than a list of vague instructions on how to take your truck apart.The worst aspect of this over-priced bird cage liner is the illustrations. In an age of life-like digital imaging and computer-aided drafting; my $16 got me a pile of pictures that could well have been reproduced on a 50's vintage stencil duplicator."
1,This book is a lemon!,"Chiltons books used to help me rebuild engines, transmissions, axles and more. They were very detailed and helpful. When I opened this one to try to troubleshoot the transmission, it says the only thing I am smart enough to do is check the fluid level. Beyond that, I need to go to a mechanic.Somewhere along the line, Chiltons has become completely worthless. I'm not wasting my time or money on them anymore."
4,Great for Do-It-Yourselfers,"This book gives great info on replacing parts, tuning, and many other items.I have both the Haynes, and Chiltons.When compared to the ""Haynes Manual"" this book has more pictures and easier to read, but, lacks ALOT of info. What the part does, how it affects the system, some history on it, and tuning tips are all things the ""Haynes Manual"" has done better than this guide."
2,Gesualdo from London - a nice try?,"Sorry, I got deeply disappointed. On the positive side, I must admit that """"Gesualdo consort"""" are couragous, and that they might belong to the musicological period of this musical period (they started in 1978!). But the result is better not compared to ""modern"" interpretations by young musicians/singers in Italy. Try listen to the OPUS111-edition of Gesualdo by Alessandrini and Concerto Italiano. One aspect is the enormous significance of getting the text pronounced not only correctly, but getting it right. Of more importance is the mood, the communication of the deep extrovert message of Gesualdo madrigals. No, somebody was able to call this ASV London-Gesualdo-record a ""miracle"": he had to be British and musicologist (yes, he is..). This ASV-version costs less, but I recommend listening to your ears and not your pocket. Gesualdo has a catholic and mediteranean content, and apparently one should not buy pirate-editions :-)in this case."
3,Would be very good for students,"An overview of Shakespeare's life and times. It could be well-used in a high school or junior high class. There's a little too much (for my taste) of the ""marriage bed was a prison"" gossipy surmising about the Stratford years. There are nice location shots, period music and attractive costumes. It has several quotes from Romeo and Juliet which the kids should like and lots of the sonnets. There are all the theories about the ""Dark Lady."" It includes info on other Elizabethans--Greene, Henslowe, Marlowe, et al and the theatre as well. I should think it would be a very good addition to a school media center or public library."
1,The Complete Equipment-Leasing Handbook,Good book but came with a defective forms CD.I was told by the American Management Association that I need to run the CD on win 95 to open the files? The book was published in 2002!
3,FALCON PRESS ALERT,This is just Hyatt's TREE OF LIES reprinted under a different title. (See my review of that book). I would recommend viewing the actual book before buying it. Make sure it's what you want.
3,Does not accpet standard light bulbs...,"I will admit that it is quiet and nice looking for the low price, but, it says it takes B 10.5 light bulbs which I could only find online after some searching."
1,junk,this is an instrument used to shave with.one would think it will be sharp.not only is it not sharp it cant be sharppend!!! junk...
4,"Nice knife, but not a razor","This is a folding knife, not a razor. If you are looking for a folding knife that can be a conversation piece, this is it. A straight edge razor that you can actually shave with costs more than $5.49; a lot more.This knife does not have a liner lock (contrary to what the description says). It has a backspring that holds the blade open, but it does not lock the blade. The backspring does a good job though. This is the reason why this knife is a bit harder to open and close than a liner lock one.Overall, it is a good knife for the price."
4,good quality for cheap price,There was trouble shipping at first (at the fault of my post office) and they resent the straight razor to me anyway. Great service! The razor is sharp and sturdy. Thanks!
2,Not a shaving tool,"This is a very neat pocket knife, shaped like a straight razor one would use to shave. It is, as such, a very poor pocket knife, and useless as a shaving razor."
2,A really expensive letter opener...,"That's about how sharp it is...even if I sharpen it, it still won't shave my face. It's just not shaped properly for straight shaves."
3,What do I do with this?,"The Ridge Runner straight razor is an enigma. I purchased it as a tactical razor but it cannot be used as such. It is a well made knife, but suffers from 2 flaws. The first; it is very hard to open, and in case of emergency, I don't want anything that's hard to manipulate. The second problem; uselessness as a shaving razor.It's a shame that all this can really be used for is a conversation piece. It's a nice looking blade, but just too hard to work with in the real world."
1,Not worth the money,"First of all, we had the worst time trying to install the Elite, so we went to a car seat check to have it properly installed. They had problems installing it. It took them over a 1/2 an hour to put it in. And my daughter (7.5 months) hates it! As a rear-facing seat, it just does not recline enough... when my daughter sleeps her head slumps and is very uncomfortable. We bought a second car seat for our other car, it is the graco touriva --- so much cheaper and better! Although it is hard to find. My daughter prefers it too! Maybe when it goes forward-facing it will be better? We are already thinking about selling it and getting another touriva so we might never know."
1,Complete rip off,This car seat is horrible. It took my husband and I an hour to put it in our Caravan which is equipped for installing LATCH car seats. We are not inexperienced parents either and this was not even close to our first car seat purchase. I think this car seat was way too much money for what you end up actually getting. Don't waste your time and effort.
2,not for first timers,Registered for this because it fits up to 100 lbs. but the latch straps are too short... I could only hook it into one side. Had to face it foward early b/c my son's head was hanging over the strap(when asleep) b/c it did not sit right in my suv. It is also hard for people who aren't used to it to work the clasps. Couldn't return it b/c I installed it over a year after it was purchased & I didn't keep the box. I still don't think I have it in properly so I am looking to replace it with a Brittax. I read a review from a woman in Calif. who said to took the State Troopers over 2 hours to try to figure it out... so I don't recomend this carseat.
1,Too Hard to Install,"This carseat was so hard to install. Finally, after several attemps I took it to a carseat inspection station. It took them over a 1/2 hour to install the carseat. Not only did it take forever to install I feel that my 7 1/2 month old daughter doesn't sit correct in it. I feel that it doesn't support her head enough espically whe she is asleep. I would not recommend this seat to anyone. I was even considering returning it but I got it for a shower gift 9 months ago. I am also going to call the maker of this product and complain to them!"
5,Great First Person Account!,"Memoirs of a Warsaw Ghetto Fighter, written by one of the surviving members of the ZOB was a well-written account of not only life as a resistance fighter but also what life was like for the few that fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. This is an easy read and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about this period and what the Jews and all victims of the Nazis had to endure."
2,Bad,I need the Canon AC - 900 and not the DC-920. Please send me your adresses for sending again to you the product. Or tell me if Ican send it to my address in Miami for returnig it to Amazon.
1,just chaos and misery,"tour de force for Hoffman, really an amazing performance. but that doesn't make it a good film. it's just misery with no redemption."
3,Good but a downer.,I am a Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan. This is a strange movie but an unrelenting downer. It's not for everyone. A real film buff should see it.I saw it once but will not view it again.
4,Hilarious and tragic at the same time,"I am a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman and indie films in general so this movie already had a lot going for it. Although the premise of the story and Hoffman's portrayal of it is extremely depressing, I found myself laughing uncontrollably at some of the situations the main character finds himself in. At times the story seems to be moving along slowly, but before you know it, the movie is over. This is one of those few movies that I have been able to watch multiple times."
3,I'll Wager Money You've Never Seen a Movie Like This...,"This is a strange movie about grief, despair, and a man who just doesn't quite know how he can go on living in light of them. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives another interesting performance as a gas-sniffing mourner who can't come to terms with his wife's suicide. Worth seeing one time for the unique experience."
3,ONE VERY FUNNY SCENE...,"I don't think you're likely to stumble across a bigger Philip Seymour Hoffman fan than the one writing this review. Magnolia shows that he has more acting ability in his pinky finger than 99% of the people in the movie business. Heck, I've even willingly put up with sub-par fare like Along Came Polly to see this guy.However...Love Liza, though it has some great scenes (one of which--actually a quick series of cutaways--is hysterical) and Hoffman is his usual brilliant self, is one long, dragging, and ultimately bitter mess.Suicide really, really sucks.Sometimes life goes on. Sometimes it comes to a screeching halt for a long, long time.Either way, funny scene aside, why choose to spend 2 hours voluntarily signing up for suicide's after effects?Watch Love Liza if you must. Your time would be much better spent on Magnolia or Hoffman's most over-looked movie: State and Main.I do not recommend this movie."
1,For Gasoline Huffers only!!!,"This is one of the most ridiculous, self-indulgent films I've ever seen. It was too awful to even call it bad. I'm certain that Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Kathy Bates had no idea it would end up as it did: boring and dreadful dialogue, dragged out scenes, insultingly lousy music, idiotic and inexplicable plot. WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE THINKING??? Did it even make it to theatres? I hope the actors were paid a lot - and hope the producers and director never work again. A MESS!"
3,Nice frames but palm trees cover the license's Month and year stickers,"I like the frames very much, the only problem is that the right side palm tree covers the license sticker (year) and you can get a ticket for that. I had to cut part of the palm tree to expose the sticker. The left side palm tree covers the first word of the license sticker (month) hopefully wont cause me to get a ticket."
4,Scrooge's Just Desserts,"Being a Dickens' fan for many decades, I picked up ""The last Christmas of Ebeneezer Scrooge"" with some trepidation, fearing that I would be offended by a copycat effort at reproducing a classic....an effort which one rightly dreads. To my utter delight, I found myself engrossed in Dickens' world and unable to put the book down. Marvin Kaye captures the feeling and spirit of ""A Christmas Carol"" and then carefully leads you beyond that into a world of spritual awakening and a search for redemption that keeps the reader involved, and, like every good mystery, eager to discover the solution.I heartily recommend this book as a perfect Christmas gift for your friends who are discriminating readers, and a must for Dickens lovers!"
5,A Gem,"There are a lot of bad ""Sound Effects"" CD's out there. Most are transparent rip-offs of the BBC's multi-volume public domain set, only with bad transfers, digital noise, and bad cut-offs.This isn't one of them.This CD is a gift-pack of period vehicles (horse-drawn, mostly), with a leavening of other period sounds, all clear and detailed and just ready to be dropped into a video or used to set the stage in a theatrical production (which is where I've reached for this CD, over and over, as a theatrical sound designer of twenty years experience.)Not exhaustively complete. Not even a great variety (despite strangeness like the bits of WWII aircraft noises). But just enough, especially if your goal is to put a little period street traffic outside the window."
4,All Aboard,"Take a baritone train ride, celebrating some of the great music from our past. Rob's amazing voice (reminiscent of Ernie Ford)booms out across the tracks of this CD, much like the great train whistles he sings about. Timeless songs, catchy new arrangements, and Rob's voice, equal a foot tapping, sing along, fun for all CD. Have your tickets ready...all aboard!"
2,This book needs to be updated!,"I purchased this book with the thought in mind that it would be the only study guide needed to pass the A+ exam. On the core hardware side, it was adequate. I passed the Core Hardware part of the exam with no problem. However, the OS Technologies study information is outdated and insufficient. I spent a great deal of time on DOS and Win 3.1, and the exam didn't really focus on that aspect of it at all. Most of the questions on the exam were for Windows 2000, which the book does not do a good job of preparing the student for. After studying the OS section, I took the exam from the CD ROM and scored a 98%. In addition, I answered all the questions at the end of the book with no difficulty. I failed OS Technologies exam with a score of 576 (needed 600 to pass)...I do not recommend this book."
5,My Laurel and Hardy VHS.,This silent short is about Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy dressed up as waiters in a fancy home. They serve the food and drinks to wealthy people.
1,Tony- Why,"Really - What is everyone else watching? What am I missing from this film that has everyone giving it rave reviews? this is one of the worst movies I have seen and I have seen some horrible movies. I can't believe that I wasted $2.99 on this instant video. It is a pretty close rip off of Dahmer, which was far superior film - 'Tony', is quite far from excellent or even acceptable."
4,Cute set-up geared for teens,"I got this based off many reviews and for the most part I agree with them. My kids enjoyed it, but I found it a little slow at times. Many parts of the love triangle just become irritating. I can say with out any doubt that the second semester is better in so many ways. If you are an animie fan, you will enjoy this. If you are looking for fan service, don't get it. If you are looking for a cozy romantic connection, this misses that by a mile. School Rumble is more of a comedy with a hint of romance, more geared towards young puppy love or classic crush since it is all mostly one sided. So buy it it is worth the price and entertainment value."
4,Hard to put down,"School Rumble revolves around an innocent and idolized teenager named Tenma and the wild and wacky classmates of her local school. It is a school comedy/slice-of-life type anime that isn't the best, yet I found very hard to put down. The level of dirtyness of the show never goes past an argument over a girl's cup size, and the violence is very mild (until the beginning of the 2nd season where the school goes nuts.) For those who don't want the extra craziness of the 2nd season, the 1st season is a good place to stop. If you change your mind, you might even grab the season 1 and 2 box set later and shove the S.A.V.E. edition into the hands of a random friend. Worth the price, and it sits neatly in my collection of the Melancholy of Haruhi and Lucky Star."
2,poor syncronization,"As other reviewers have indicated, this is some of the best footage of Rostropovich on DVD. The cinematography is excellent and the sound quality generally is good. The sound - picture sycronization is, however, not great and I would hesitate recommending this pressing. The time delay between the sound and action is just too excessive to make this an enjoyable and worthwhile purchase."
3,Cute,"Cute product, granddaughter likes it. I'm not terribly impressed, but if she likes it then that is what matters. I do like the fact that the colors don't stain other things if it gets on something else. Seems overpriced."
2,Go with real markers,"I was shocked to see all the positive reviews on this and other Color Wonder products and had to offer an alternative viewpoint. My daughter (now 4) has gotten Color Wonder stuff as a gift from grandparents for the past two years, and really dislikes it. As do I. It doesn't color well, often doesn't show up, and is just really frustrating to use. You're also stuck using the markers on the specific Crayola sheets - so much for creativity. She just opened it this year, wanted to like it, tried it, and it's already in the trash. Do yourself a favor and go with regular (washable, if you're worried about mess) markers - they work better and allow for far more creativity."
1,Glitter gets everywhere!!,"I like Color Wonder products for travel in the car, and was excited when my daughter received this as a gift for her birthday. But as soon as we opened the paper package, glitter went everywhere. Whenever my daughter colors on the paper, more glitter is loosened and is sent everywhere. It creates a HUGE glitter mess all over the place--table, clothes, floor...this is a pet peeve for me, since it is so hard to clean up glitter. I was really disappointed at the mess this no-mess product created since I have liked other Color Wonder products."
4,color wonder : disney princess,"My nephew's daughter wanted this for Christmas. She also just had a birthday and still likes coloring in it. She can't color on other things with this coloring book, which is wonderful for someone her age."
1,Very bad production of a great play.,"For a great actor, Olivier makes an awful director...at least in this production. Compared to Kenneth Branagh, and his amazing interpretations of Shakespeare's works, this film is pathetic. From the bad acting, to the sets, this film feels like it was made by a college student with a home video recorder. That this version is acclaimed, is a joke. It is so boring it is unreal, and it is one video that I wish I had never seen."
2,ideal holm,"people who say Olivier's Lear is superior to Holm's are morons. Are ye stones? By Common consent, Olivier's Lear, played as a senile man, was deeply flawed, great actor tho' he might have been he got it wildy wrong at times. Gilgeud thought Holm's Lear wonderful as `did Pinter. Ignore the rubbish on this site.Holm is terrific; Olivier is not"
1,Why did i watch this movie?,"2.5+ hours wasted on a film that i heard was supposed to be one of the great works by Elliot. Olivier, whom plays King Lear himself, did a wonderful job playing the part. The only true fall back that made me despise the movie was the way it was done. The actors said their lines as if reading straight from Shakespeares play itself. and while this seemed good at the beginning, i found it VERY hard to stay awake towards the middle and end. If a movie of King Lear is what you are looking for, then i suggest you view the movie ""Ran"" by Kurosawa. Not only does it follow the King Lear story, but it does a wonderful job of doing so."
1,pity,"i received it today. I was very happy that time. but I can't see it. Because. It can not work in japan. Oh, I made a mistake.What a pity."
1,Poor performance from Olivier.,"While his films of Hamlet and Henry IV are brilliant, this performance was disappointing. I am not sure whether he was past his prime or if the part simply did not suit him, but the full weight of the King's character is missing. Another point I found extremely irritating is that Olivier mutters his lines on numerous occasions making it very difficult to understand his words, it left me scrambling for the remote control to turn on the sub-titles, unfortunately there is none on the DVD, so I was left miserably struggling to understand many passages. The rest of the cast were super, John Hurt especially was electrifying as the fool. But overall one to avoid."
4,Not the last,"It is not the best. Sometimes it is boring, sometimes the scenario doesnt help. Sometimes the actors reactions (including Olivier) look incompatible to the scene. But I think this is much more a hardship inherent to this complex play, wonderful and overwhelming creation of Shakespeare. What I think is that this picture is really good and must be praised."
4,Powerful,"I am not a film critic, but have read a lot of Shakespeare. I remember the first time that I had to watch this film as a teen in college. I covered my eyes when they were about to out Gloucester's eyes and I cried at the end. I rarely cry when I watch movies. So, I don't know about comparing this version to others or about set, but I don't think I would have responded so if the movie hadn't been effectively done. I also found Olivier's acting to be great because it left me ambivalent toward Lear (it made me sense both his greatness and his folly). Now, I am going to make my students watch it in their college class. I'm sure their will be at least one who felt its power like I did."
3,"Mutas Mutandis, a Classic, but not Trashy either","This book has got an interesting premise, but it doesn't have as broad a scope as it's title suggests. It concentrates primarily on a relatively small number of works and doesn't draw nearly as heavily on postmodernist theory as one might imagine. She places herself slightly on the relativist side of the cultural studies chasm, but for many she won't go far enough. She researchs the works she deals with really well and the book is well written, though she uses that Lain phrase a bit much (I had to look it up too) Her arguements are compeeling, though the debate she deal with polarise people so much that she's either preaching to the converted or blowing against the wind."
3,Beware of fretboard damage,"I picked up these strings specifically to play slap bass, since my musical ""job"" was changing a bit. They are low tension, have a nice snap to them and a decent tone, not really like guts but a bit brighter. They play well for slapping, which is what they're meant for.The problem is that the E and A strings (the metal wrapped strings-- the D and G are nylon-wrapped) seem to have very sharp edges that take a little while to wear down-- and the first few times I played them I was very shocked to see horizontal grooves being worn into the fretboard that were clearly from the string windings rubbing as they hit the board. This has settled down as the strings got played in, but the damage is done and will be there until I have the fretboard resurfaced sometime.I realize slapping is going to wear a fretboard more than other styles-- but these strings do you no favors, and I've heard from knowledgeable sources that higher priced strings are much more gentle on the fretboard."
3,This is only about the Toy Symphony,"Leopold Mozart is known for being the father of his son, but he left some music behind qhen he left this world and his son, among other pieces this Symphony using some toy-instruments . We may think it is for kids, but it does not sound like it. It is too stiff and austere for them. Then it must be some exotic piece for bored aristocrats who want to discover some new sounds to stir their fin de siècle ennui . It probably is the real value of it. The use of those toy-instruments is funny and creates a sound-universe of some value, but the rest of the music is too frozen and orthodox to really take advantage of the novelty and be enhanced by it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,She likes it!,"I got this for my 3-month old daughter because she loves to kick. She is now almost 5 months and still loves this toy. She really likes to raise her legs up in the air and kick the stuff up above to make the music play. I would have given it 5 starts but it doesn't have good grip, so i placed it against the wall and it works fine. She kicks and smiles for a good 15-20 minutes straight!To dispel some of the other reviews:My child's length is in the 85% percentile (not legless).She doesn't grab at the toys overhead, she kicks them and that is fun to her.It's super easy to put together.There ARE English instructions, it's page 1 of a 20 page manual, each page is a different language. Although, you really don't need instructions if you have every put anything together before. It comes in 4 parts and they all click together."
3,Cute but...,"Cute toy but I expected the kick panel to be electronically connected to the lights and sound. I was disappointed. I also expected that for almost 40 bucks that is would be a little better quality. Don't get me wrong my baby likes it, I just expected more!"
3,Piece of Plastic,"I previously owned the Fisher Price Kick and Drive Gym which my first child used. She loved it and played with it for quite some time. I loved that the kick pad actually made the toy come on. It was also very easy to move from the lying position to the sitting position. The wheel does make a noise that could scare some children if they are not used to it but it was no problem for us.The Chico gym is a joke. The foot panels do nothing more than squeak like a dog toy. It is not electronically connected to the rest of the toy. Also, you have to disassemble the gym in order to simply move it down to the sitting position. I wish I had never sold the Fisher Price one. I can say that it is attractive and does do the job as far as a toy goes, but don't count on getting any time for yourself out of it."
1,Only if your baby is 12 inches tall,"Totally not worth the price we paid for it. The kick panel is only interesting if the baby can use it! Unfortunately, our 3 month olds legs flop over it and when she does manage to kick, the toys above her head fly down to belly level meaning she can't see the lights OR touch the toys anymore. BOO. Not a good product."
2,too small in height and width - kick just generate smal squeak,I bought this toy for my 1 and 1/2 month baby boy - expecting it to be similar to playskools kick gym (not available now) - which my daughter used to play a lot(when she was 1 month old).In playskool toy the height and width was good - and the kicking spacewas huge - besides it used to play song and move the hanging handles on kick(ie encouragedkicking).In this one -first of all the height and width is too small for even my 1 month baby(9 pounds).Its hard to kick it (as small foot space) - and it only makes small squeaking noise(no lights or moving of top hanging handles) on kick.The only good thing is the top hanging parts on moving - makes some lights and song. So maybe it willbe good toy for baby to use with hand- rather then kick toy.
1,Has hurt my little boy- I hate this toy!!!!,"I absolutely HATE THIS TOY!I bought it for my 8 month old boy, so he could play with it when he stayed at his cradle.Unfortunately, this toy is very badly engineered! The first time my boy played with it, we pulled the white top part with his hands, it fell back and crushed against his little face.I was absolutely terrified when I saw the skin around his left eye growing purple to the size of a berry, while the poor baby cried his lungs out.Thank God, nothing happened to his eyeball, but he's now with a big swollen purple area all around it.I am returning this toy TODAY, and I strongly advise careful parents NOT TO BUY this for their babies."
2,"Ok for tummy time, useless for anything else","My 3 month old son is already way too big for this product. I agree with the previous reviewers, there was no thought put into the design. None of the functions work when the baby is on his back because the design doesn't have the hanging toys anywhere near his hands. The part that he's supposed to kick doesn't activate the sounds and lights or make an interesting noise.Not recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a toy for my 3 month old Grandson who loves to kick. I remember having a toy like this for my youngest child; he loved kicking the bar and making things move. The huge difference is when my Grandson kicks the blue feet, it just makes a sound. No lights or actions occur unless you reach up and touch the items on the top (white section). By the time my grandson will be big enough to reach what is on top (the yellow butterfly, red flower, and the clear round ball) he won't be lying down on his back kicking. Disappointing..."
2,Not for use with snails!,"I actually haven't used it, because it says on the package not to use if you have snails in your tank. It did not mention this on the website, so I bought it but haven't had the opportunity to see if it works or not... I am planning to try to transfer my snails to another tank and then I can try it on my tank that has an algae bloom, but there are a lot of little snails to pick out, so I hope to have the kids do it over break... I will update my review then."
2,No difference,"Not a bad thing, but made a slim difference. It's not really necessary. The algae did reduce, but overfeeding and tank light being on max 8 hours a day reduced algae."
3,Sweet Jesus,"Ok, having read Candy and The Candy Men and A Grand Guy, I just had to find some more Mace--Found an excerpt from this book in The Olympia Press Reader which is A collection of excerpts from Maurice ""Gid"" Girodias's Travellers Companion series. This series of mostly banned books written under pseudonyms by the financially strapped Paris ex-pat crowd was comprised mainly of naughty books masquerading as Quality lit. The excerpt in this collection depicts a character who discovers that he is a cuckold and returns the favor in kind then re-falls in love with his lover as he takes her rectal temperature. Very funny."
3,Meh...,"I had been meaning to order this stuff for quite some time from amazon... But just the other day I saw some at the Giant Foods near Ryan's house and we picked up a bottle. Boy am I glad I waited on ordering this stuff, it is not all that great. It tastes more like salt than cheddar. There is no white cheddar taste or aroma to it whatsoever... I was severely under whelmed."
3,Not very durable,"First: This isn't a box of ten wallets in a box. This is a single, green expandable folder.Now, this is a nicely proportioned wallet that neatly housed my folders for the space of 1 month. It opens and closes with a satisfying (or embarrassing), loud velcro noise. I took it to school with me for one month with six fairly filled folders. I did add more papers and over the month the folder was under increasing stress. It wore it well. That's why I was surprised and disappointed when one evening I came home and found the cover torn in two - the velcro had done its job so well in securing the cover that under whatever frictional forces the cover experienced, it split in half.So... I'm buying a plastic folder in the future. This cardboard folder might be fine to serve as storage in a filing cabinet, but it cannot long withstand the stresses of daily travel."
5,Loved it!,What a wonderful collection of poetry by Floriana Hall. I highly recommend this book. It flows beautifully and is inspirational-a real up-lifter!
1,Not recommended,A bad textbook I have read for algebra.The author seems to be complicating every concept thats simple to understand.Also most of the proofs given are not straight forward and forces you to refer to some other books for a clear understanding and definitions of the same concepts given in the book.Not at all recommended.Better buy a Fraleigh or Herstein or Thomas Hungerford even if your teacher recommends this one.
4,Nice salad bowl!,"My wife really likes this salad bowl. The only concern I have over it is that the edges feel a bit rough/unfinished. I don't anticipate this happening but I cringe at the thought of cutting myself from inadvertent chipping along the sides. It's a bit awkward to handle - I feel like we have to be extremely delicate with it. Because of that, we don't tend to take it out often. But it does serve it's purpose and does so very well."
4,A nice addition to my kitchen,"It's a little thinner than I would like and there are air bubbles, but once it's filled with salad or dessert it's lovely. It arrived quickly and was well packed and the shipping was free which is a huge deal to Hawaii. Overall it was a good purchase."
2,Wish it was better... only worth the money since it is the ONLY one!,"I have used this book about 10 times ... Half of those times I have had to stop and ask a person if they know of this place or have ended up at the completely wrong place all together. I don't think the person who wrote the directions really lives in Tampa. Most of the ""walks"" are too easy. THe inforamtion is good but almost all of this you can get online.I really would not recommend this book unless you have a really good update to date GPS to help you actually find where you want to go."
1,Dreadful,"I have read and enjoyed many of Mercedes Lackey's books. I am not so familiar with Ellen Guon's work.Bedlam's Bard was not an example of good writing, something of which I know Mercedes Lackey is capable. I nearly stopped reading it in the middle, something I rarely do.It is disjointed. It is redundant. It over-explains. The relationships between characters range from unhealthy to downright creepy even when you can tell the authors mean them to be positive. There is a surplus of reversed-in-the-nick-of-time near death experiences. It lacks depth and cohesion overall.The idea behind the story could be clever, but the application is very poor.If you wish to read books by these authors, I would choose something else. And I WOULD try something else by either writer before deciding all of their works are this poor."
1,BEWARE It's only a reprint.,The original books are wonderful; but the publisher's idea to reprint two fairly recent books into one with only a small warning to faithful readers is terrible. I suspect that the same is happening with the other two 'new' paperbacks that are forthcoming; Fiddlers Fair and Oathblood.
5,Two books in one...,"This is a 2-in-1 edition of ""Knight of Ghosts and Shadows"" and ""Summoned to Tourney."" As these are two of my favorite books, I quickly purchased it, but it may be an unpleasant surprise for those hoping for a sequel."
1,Bedlam's Bard by Mercede Lackey,When looking for a new book to read I knew I couldn't go wrong with Mercedes Lackey. I have read many of her books and enjoyed them immensely. This book was awful. I couldn't even finish it. It was so boring. It seemed to be set up as some kind of structered formula. I hope it is the co-author that's the problem and Mercedes hasn't lost her touch.
5,Just to overcome the...,"I'd normally give this book only 4 stars because I Never give 5, but the ... who only gave it one star based on the fact that they did not undertand the writing forced me to up it one.This book is great. The situations are realistic. One detractor complained about 'endless near-death escpaes'(something like that), but that is the one thing that I identified with. Eric is battling himself as much as any 'villian' in the book. His refusal to acknowledge his role leads, as it would in real life, to many pitfalls and situations. If you deny yourself, life seems to constantly put you in bad situations and frustrate you to no end until you get in line and follow your destiny.This book is very good and there are lessons to be learned in it. And if you don't like it, go back to reading ""Star Trek"" or something by Stephen King. :P"
1,Worst Mercedes Lackey Book EVER,"Like most of the other readers to review this book I am a fan of Mercedes Lackey. I've enjoyed many of her series. I know she partners with different writers on various series and I've never noticed the writing suffer for it. I don't know if her choice of co-author is where this book went horribly wrong. Maybe it seems so awful because it was written 20+ years ago and Mrs.Lackey has dozens of books under her belt now. I just know I was excited to stumble across this series, that is until I read the first two chapters of this book. I kept going hoping it would get better and certain it couldn't get worse. I was wrong on both accounts. This is the worst book I've ever read with Mercedes Lackey as an author. In fact, it's one of the worst books I've ever read by ANY author. I expected an good story, what I got was 600+ pages of bird cage liner. Don't waste your money or your time reading the bad bard books!"
4,My favorite Author,I decided to collect the entire set for my collection. This is just the first step. The book was in very good condition like promised.
4,Solves the problem,"Is there nothing you can't buy on Amazon? I looked for this at Lakeshore Learning and Office Depot to no avail (the guy looked at me like I had two heads when I asked for it). But found it on Amazon in 30 seconds!Love that I can hang children's artwork, our school posters, anything, anywhere and it removes with no damage.I will tell you though, it's not so great on glass. It doesn't seems to stick. Nevertheless, on walls, the fridge, etc. wonderful!"
5,scotch removable tape,couldn't find this anywhere in town-found it here at a good price and got it right away-this is a craft must have
3,size is an issue,"If you are over 5'10"", this watch might look small on your wrist. It keeps accurate time though."
5,"nice watch, good price",I ordered two of the silver for christmas gifts and the bicolor for myself. the quality is good and the band easy to adjust.Really happy with the purchase.
1,"Cannot access color, so impossible to buy.",Looks like a real nice jacket and I probably would have bought two. But once you put the size in it is suppose to prompt you for a color. Does not. I guess you really did not want to sell any of these.
3,Decent from Gleason.,"I expected more from Jason Gleason, the 2nd singer from Further Seems Forever. But it isn't bad. Its still on my IPod... With only about 2000 songs that can fit, its saying a lot."
5,experience bleeds through,Absolutely loving the book! It's exactly what I was looking for... practical advice for applying the Kimball Method to the new SQL2005 toolset. Their experience with the toolset bleeds through the pages. (And how much experience they have with SQL2005 is amazing considering when it went RTM!) Highly recommended.
2,"More an academic discussion, than hands-on","I found this a frustrating book. Eventually I skipped this first 43 pages of introduction plus 120 first pages of the book proper. I felt the authors were more interested in using esoteric language than actually showing how to use the product. If you're trying to baffle someone with tech-speak, this is the book for you. If you have a deadline, and are trying to actually accomplish something, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Disappointed."
4,A Solid and Pragmatic Guide,"This book provides the requisite knowledge to leverage the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 platform in developing a data warehouse. The practical techniques and proven 'Business Dimensional Lifecycle' approach provide a useful roadmap to implementing a complete solution.Thorough descriptions and detailed examples guide the reader through the phases of a DW/BI project. While the primary focus is on handling the design and development facets the entire lifecycle is addressed. This start to finish approach provides a solid comprehensive view.The book finds a nice balance between samples and how-to steps, methodology, and conceptual aspects of a DW/BI project. The author's honest insight lends credibility and their pragmatic design choices and strategies are based on significant experience. I would highly recommend this book to anyone involved with planning, developing, or supporting a DW/BI system on the SQL Server platform."
3,James Mackay: A man to Cherish 1761-1822,I bought this book to supplement a project I had been doing for a year on my family tree. Done in the style of a memoir the book is fine. If you are looking for the genealogy line - the info is scanty on dates but will give you the basic(s) in order to search the line thru the internet. The Macdonald side is missing - but I contacted the author and she gave me several leads on researching in the area that the family came from. The internet has pictures of the Mackay map that is now in the Smithsonian.
4,War Bird Classic in Photos,"If you love classic warbirds and air shows, you'll really enjoy this book. There are many fantastic pictures of restored, flying P-51 Mustangs taken over the years from various shows and collectors. This is the next best thing to being there, unless you're a professional photographer, these are much better shots than most of us could ever hope to take.There are a few P-51B's, C's, most are D models in various paint/camouflage schemes. There's even a P-48 (the Enforcer) which I'd never seen before. The captions are about the individual planes & owners, not a history of the Mustang, not a good book for a modeler, unless you just wanted exterior shots - no cockpits or wheel wells here.Not a `must have' but a nice to have, I enjoy seeing such sharp images of this classic plane. I was able to pick this up for a few dollars, not bad for the price."
4,Solid performance,"While this is a solid performance by Jeff Lynne, Richard Tandy, and others, it lacks the energy of a truly live ELO concert ""back in the day."" The string section ladies are clad in slinky black dresses instead of bouncing around the stage like the original band used to do. This may partly be due to the size of the venue - this isn't an arena performance, it's more intimate, like a TV studio audience.That being said, the music itself is spot on. They obviously rehearsed well for this performance. It's obviously live, not looped, but the performances are almost note for note. Hits are included from both the Zoom album and previous ELO standards. Includes a new saucer, too!"
3,Lifeless,"I love Jeff Lynne and ELO and was looking forward to this DVD release, but alas, it is kind of lifeless. The band, made up of top-notch session players, played very uninspired and yeoman-like. The songs were there, but the performance was not up to par."
2,Save Your Money,"Zoom is rather disappointing for true ELO fans, the performance of earlier ELO material is rather lacking in substance and commitment (but not talent), the chemistry on stage is clearly lacking despite Jeff's excellent guitar and vocal talent, perhaps a link up with ELO Part 2 would have restored the former excellence of live performances, Jeff Lynne was not ELO, it was a collective of highly talented artists, the core of Zoom is in effect Jeff Lynne's tribute to ELO.The new material from Zoom is brilliant, Jeff is an excellent musician in his own right, rather than prostitute the name of the former ELO it is quite bewildering why Jeff Lynne did not go for it under his own name with Zoom, he certainly has the credibility.Verdict: If you want true ELO save you money and buy the DVD ""Out of the Blue"" Tour."
2,Missing something,"I have been buying ELO vinyl since grade school. There is just something missing from this dvd. No energy and the sound is somewhat stale. I'm not sure if there are original band members missing on this, but it does not sound like the crisp ELO albumns that I have. Jeff's voice to me is kind of off par on this performance as well.Just a dull DVD."
1,"Good quality dvd, awful quality performance","Why oh why was this concert issued as a dvd? This show is so weak and tepid it could actually damage ELO's reputation. I could imagine this show as making the bootleg rounds for the Lynne worshippers. But as a released dvd, this stinks to high heaven!"
1,Sometimes it is just good to retire,I loved the music made years ago but this DVD has to be one of the worst preformances I have heard. If you love this band and want to remember the good ole'days don't buy this.
4,Looks and Sounds Great!,"I enjoy good quality DVD concerts (sound and video), and this one is very good. Lots of the old songs from ELO together with some 'newer' ones from their recently released 'album' (at the time of the concert)The music is surprisingly 'full' given the relatively few musical instruments being played on stage.ELO fans (young and older) will enjoy this DVD concert video.Gil"
5,Zoom out a little more ....,E.L.O. Greatest live video at the moment. This is just a zoom of some of the best songs by E.L.O. Is just that E.L.O. has to many goods songs that they really need a double/triple album to make fans happy. Quality and performance is great. If you are a fan or not this is a must have album. I hope E.L.O. / Jeff Lynne release another dvd album with their greatest hits with more songs some day.
4,Great ELO Tunes bring back memories of Out of the Blue...,"About 20 years ago, I saw ELO live at the Chicago Stadium for their ""Out of the Blue"" tour, complete with their giant ELO UFO. The sound, songs, and visuals made it the best concert I have attended, to date. The ZOOM DVD brings back some of those great memories, and although most of the original ELO members are not present, the two most important ones, Jeff Lynne and Richard Tandy, are. Hearing and seeing those songs performed live gave me goose bumps, especially watching Richard Tandy play the synthesizer to ""Telephone Line"" and the grand piano to ""Evil Woman"". There was no violinist on stage to take the place of Mik Kaminski, so a few songs (Telephone Line, in particular), suffered slightly. However, the mix of old, very old, and new songs were good, and I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of ELO and/or Jeff Lynne"
4,Jeff Lynne never sounded better,"Long time ELO fan and its too bad this tour got off to a bad start and had to be cancelled. Jeff sounds as good as he did back in the 70's. Rosie Vela , his female counterpart sounds great and the two celloist's add a great touch to all the great music this group has produced. The concert builds towards a rocking end and although I did not particularly like some of the new Zoom songs it did not distract me away from a great concert. The visual and audio are well reproduced and it is fun to watch Jeff with his curly afro-like hair and sunglasses enjoy himself up on stage. It also shows towards the end of the show on songs like ""Shine alittle Love"", ""Don't bring Down"" and ""Roll over Beethoven"" what a good guitarist his is. Go ahead and buy. you will enjoy"
4,back to ELO?,This is a good dvd but it would be good to see the rest of the band not just Jeff and it was a little to much like he was in a studio not a live concert but I enjoy it !
5,Hello....how are you? Have you been alright?,"ELO was my favorite band for most of my high school years (late 70s). I eventually left ELO behind as being an outdated dinosaur band. Then in the late 90's I picked up a few of their better albums (now on CD, of course) and rediscovered them. Unfortunately, I never had the pleasure of seeing the band live, but this DVD almost makes up for it. Although it's really more ""The Jeff Lynne Show"" than ELO (I certainly don't recall three hot woman being in the band back in the 70s!). The show was beautifully filmed in a small venue, Lynne's voice sounds as good as it ever did, and the songs.....well, if you're reading this I probably don't have to tell you about those magnificent songs. Instead, you're probably wondering whether or not you should bother spending the money on the DVD. The answer is YES! Both the sound and picture quality are excellent. And hearing Lynne sing ""One Summer Dream"" and ""Telephone Line"" again may just make you cry."
5,What a treat!,I am not one for writing reviews but this DVD has made me do one now. Outstanding performance. I have to say that you can tell the group practiced hard to produce a flawless performance. I think they have not gotten enough credit for all the hard work they must have put in to this performance. What a shame they did not capitalize on it through a tour that was cancelled. But this is without a doubt my favorite live performance of music from my past. Count me in with those who think that this in some ways is even better than the original performances although a few more strings would have been nice. I wish I had seen this in person but the recording is great because I can watch it over and over which I have and will. The real evidence of a hit in my book is the desire to hear it agaian and again. Its tireless. Buy it.
4,Musically Great,"Let me tell you, I was excited when the DVD came. I couldn't wait to watch it! The sound was great! Jeff sounded spot-on for most of the songs. The vocals were very strong from Rosie and the others as well. The filming was very good I thought too. Not cutting edge, but pretty good overall.I had never seen ELO in the day so I have nothing to compare them to, but have always loved their music through the years. The flip side of my opinion is that the band was in need of a...drink! Most of the band appeared so stiff they nearly looked in pain? And Jeff's sunglasses had to go!It is sad because that will probably be their last chance on film to show their stuff! A band that took me through high school and beyond. A band that really was different than the other main stream bands of the day. I loved it overall, and will watch it over and over, you'll have to forgive though if I just close my eyes and...Listen. -Gavin-"
4,LONG AWAITED,A JEFF LYNNE (ELO) FAN FOR YEARS. THIS CONCERT IS A COLLECTIONOF OLD & NEW SONGS. JEFF & THE BAND SOUNDED GREAT. A GOOD BUYFOR THIS 'OLDER' GROUP FANS.....
5,IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS YOU ARE DEAF AND I HATE YOU,What can I say. Such a sweet blend of rock and orchestra. Tell the blond gal beside Jeff that I want to marry her. The mixing on my setup is fabulous. I truly enjoy this DVD! This gets the Larry Hinze seal of approval-and I just clubbed some seals on Alki Beach yesterday!
4,"A little overproduced, but still a must","Yeah, I'm one of those unlucky soul's holding onto tickets for the ill fated Zoom tour. This recording goes along way to heal the wound. The song selection is great. Though, I wish there had been a couple of tracks from Balance of Power. And, the production is so polished that it's hard to tell that this is a live recording."
3,DO SOMETHING JEFF!!!,"It would be nice if he did. He stands there like a muppet without much enthusiasm.They have done pretty well all things considered. I never thought Jeff Lynne would do an another ""ELO"" album after ""Balance of Power."" All round, it's a good dvd musically, but they don't sound as good as they used to obviously. If you want a concert to crank up in your lounge room and dance around to, this isn't the one. However, it's still a good selection of the ELO hits and they do a reasonable job covering them.Pros- Good sound, although they need to turn up the cello's, you can barely hear them.- Picture quality is good- Jeff and friends do a reasonable job covering the songs. I was suprised how good Jeff's voice sounds after all these years.Cons- Jeff and the rest of the band aren't very animated. It's like watching them rehearse.- Not a very good atmosphere. If they were playing in front of 10,000 it would be more interesting. It's just filmed in front of a studio audience."
3,"Great video, but sound quality is lacking","This DVD contains some great live performances of classic ELO tunes. BUT the audio quality is lacking. Specifically, the audio levels are all over the place - like the automatic level control on a cheap cassette deck. Don't get me wrong, the frequency response and noise levels are great for a live recording, but the ""breathing"" and ""pumping"" effects from the varying audio levels is disturbing. Note that I am not an audiophile and my descriptions are probably not technically accurate but you should get my meaning."
5,Superb,"This book is an excellent source of information for the Goju Ryu practitioner. I would venture to say that all karateka would benefit from reading Kane and Wilder's book, regardless of martial arts style. The authors did a tremendous job of (if nothing else) forcing the reader to think about the various possibilities existing within kata versus simply practicing the kata at ""face value"".While the entire book is generally devoted to kata, once I began to read it I realized there was much more to this book than I had anticipated. Kane and Wilder did an outstanding job of laying out each topic, and I really enjoyed the ""Intro, Body, and Summary"" format of the chapters, which makes the book very easy to reference.I caught myself over and over again putting the book down and really contemplating the material - which I believe is one of the points the authors were trying to make!There is really a lot of stuff packed into this book. Job well done."
5,"Excellent, must have for serious martial artist","Perhaps the best book on the martial arts I have read. The authors help remind us that forms are not a dance, they are deadly techniques in a transmittable form. The book helps you achieve the right mindset for analyzing kata of any style (though the authors are based in Goju-Ryu) to uncover the practical, dangerous moves that have been hidden. A wonderful tool for those looking to develop fighting skill from their chosen art."
5,looking at the kata from new angle,"The book deepened my training. As former judo practicioner i was happy to see some details that might be forgotten during daily training. Absolutely valuable, presenting kata as useful set of techniques being trained for conrete purpose."
4,Extremely good,"I would recommend this book to any serious martial artist, regardless of their style. I have read plenty of books that discuss interpreting kata moves, and at first glance this would appear to be ""just another kata book."" However, this book goes a step further and discusses determining the strategy of a particular style, and concentrating on finding kata interpretations that fit that strategy.The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating comes from some of the ""optimized"" versions of kata interpretations contained in one of the later chapters of the book. Most of them are quite good, but I was disappointed to see a ""2-hand press block"" being used to deflect an incoming punch. As one of my old teachers put it, ""If you need two hands to block one punch, you're in the wrong fight!"""
3,waiting....,"still hasn't shown up yet..not sure why.. i ordered this and another book at the same time, yet this one has not been processed, with no explanation and no way to get a hold of the sender..wtf"
5,the best strings available,"When a friend first suggested Elixir strings for my guitar several years ago, I balked. They cost two or three times what I was used to paying, but he talked me into it. I've never looked back. They sound better, last longer, are more playable and resist rust far better than any other strings I've used, and I used to go through a set or two a month in my club playing days. I wish these had existed then, because I would have probably saved money in the long run. When I decided to pick up my five-string again after years of neglect, I went directly to Elixir, and I love these strings. I'm thinking of treating my mandolin to a set next. They're well worth the price. RWThe Tao Of Writing: Imagine. Create. Flow."
5,Hidden Treasures,There are so many wonderful 'Hidden' treasures in the Bible that are often misunderstood by our Western interpretations. Opening up our minds to Eastern customs that were prevelant during the time of scriptural writings open up understanding to new depths. The woman who cried at the feet of Jesus - this scripture is much deeper and profound once the cultural component is included in the interpretation. Every serious studier of scripture and even those that just want scripture opened up to a new dimension need this little book!
1,THEY DO NOT ERASE!,"11-24-10Just got these pencils today after reading the reviews. Not much talked about regarding erasing, but took a chance.Bought these as a teacher who works with kids in a help class and sometimes help kids in math by marking up their paper.Because I wanted my markups to stand out, I wanted a colored pencil, but kids sometimes want to erase the teacher marks.Opened them up, eager to see, drew a line and then tried to erase and TERRIBLE. Fades about 50% of the writing, but can easily see what was drawn or written.Tried other colors, all the same result- can still see what was written after erasing- tried another eraser- NO BETTER.Do not buy if looking for the ""erase"" factor of a colored pencil.Will continue to search.p.s. I contacted seller: TCP Gloabal and he heard my complaint, but passed my on to an ""Amazon rep"" and that just got me a VOICE MAIL!!!! AAAHHH"
1,Don't Erase!,"I should have listened to the one bad review. They just don't erase. I have used crayola erasable colored pencils and each eraser matches the color of the pencil. Those erase much better. If I wanted a pencil that didn't erase I would have boughten regular ones. They are good quality in that they don't break easy and sharpen well, but if you are looking for an erasable pencil I would go with crayola or something else."
4,"Nice, but not as I thought...","I ordered these as a Christmas present, but when they came they were not of as good a quality as I thought they would be, instead, they seem like pencils you could buy in any drugstore, the only difference being each pencil has an eraser. They are still nice, but I will have to wait until my friend tries them till I know how they work."
5,Childhood favorite,"I loved all the Jenny Linskey books as a child and still find them charming as an adult. They are queit, gentle books and I remember how as a shy child it was comforting to have books about other shy creatures read to me. It also helped a lot that the cat and I shared a name, Jenny, and that I had a pet black cat."
4,walking,"I liked the trail culture aspect, but some gear and what worked info would have been nice. It seemed to just bounce around and really didn't present any real helpful info."
2,Only 1 good song,"The only good song on Christina Aguilera's full CD is ""Genie In A Bottle"". I was hoping for more up-beat songs like it, but was incredably depressed when the other 12 songs on the CD turned out to be love songs. If you like ""Genie In a Bottle"" like I did, don't get this, get the single CD."
3,don't have it but...,Well I don't have this CD but I do like Christina Aguilera's voice. I think that the way people re comparing her to Britney Spears is VERY VERY ANNOYING! Can't you just say what you think about her without comparing her to anyone else? Well I sure wish that people would do that.
4,give it a few listens...,"The first thing you'll notice when you put in this cd is Christina's voice. She's got the Mariah ~ Whitney ~ Celine thing down!Then.... you hear WHAT she's singing.It's a sad thing that her record company is trying to market someone with real staying power as just another teen pop act. Anyhow, you may not like the songs at first. The songs will grow on you though, as her cd survives only due to her incredible voice.Pick this cd up if you wanna hear some REAL talent :)"
4,Great!,"The CD is great.It has many good tracks.Some tracks are just cheesy bubblegum pop but they are still good.Christina Aguilera has a wonderfull voice that can be compared to Mariah Carey.And Christina Aguilera is much much better than Britney Spears, thank you very much!"
4,Christina Aguilera,"This CD is pretty good. Most of the songs are good and rather good. Except, after a while, it can get a little annoying. The songs Genie In A Bottle, What A Girl Wants, I Turn To You, So Emotional, Come On Over, and Relflection are all great. After that, the album seems to go downward. Personally, I think Britney Spears is a better singer, with a little more original songs. But, if you want a great pop CD, buy this!"
4,YOU GO GIRL!,"Congrats to Christina on the Grammy award! I honestly was hoping that she would beat out britney (who I have nothing against)! The C.d is great except for the lyrics! Some of them are bad. Like Genie in a bottle and when you put your hands on me. So stay away from them ok? Christina, if your reading this review I love you and I'm praying for you! Best of luck!"
4,VITAL! (read this please!),Britney must be BRIMMING w\ jealousy! The only concern about the lyrics is that some of the songs are well... lyricly bad. Waaaay to provocative! But @ least Christina doesn't dress half way nude like dear old Brit-Brit
1,I'm a big fan of Christina Aguilera,"Hello! This is the first time I'm here and I dont really know what to write,But I can say this: The ""Christina Aguilera""album,is the best album.That's for sure!"
3,Not A Good CD,"There's only three songs that I can stand. Genie in a Bottle, What a Girl Wants, and Reflection. All of Ms.Aguilera's songs are slow or just sort of upbeat. If the song writers wright really fast tunes then it will sound like Britney Spears. I just think that Christina Aguilera is a copy of Britney Spears. Britney started the whole female pop thing. Britney just opened the door Christina, Jessica, Mandy and others. So she is the true teen queen of pop music. The others are just copycats! I think this CD is a rip-off so don'y waste your money on this CD!"
2,I'VE HEARD BETTER,"I think the girl can sing but comparing her to Whitney, Mariah, and Celine is a bit too premature.She's just yet another imitator of the aforementioned ladies. I don't find her particularly soulful. She thinks she can be the best by oversinging and screeching.Another thing. I am sick of her and her fans's attitude towards Beyonce. I am not a fan of Beyonce either but Christina and her fans are just pure haters. Beyonce does sing better IMO. Her tones are better than ""Xtina's"" who tries to sing beyond her limits."
5,Are you a Christina fan?after this I am!,"Hi.I was NoT a Christina Aguilera fan when ""I'm a Genie in a Bottle"" came out. I saw her on t.v. and thought well, she is just another Brittany Spears or Jessica Simpson.I was wayyy wrong!Then my friend gave me the c.d. on my birthday.It sat there in my room for about 3 months. Then I got REALLY bored one day and thought I might as well listen to it.I'm just here to tell you that it is my ALL TIME favorite c.d. I still dont really like the song ""genie in a bottle"" but since then Chistina Aguilera has been my fav. singer.It is definetly worth buying!I'm sure it would be a great Chistmas present for a loved one.I have read some other reviews and a few of them dont like the c.d. and I dont know what is wrong with them because it is great!The only songs on the ENTIRE c.d. I dont like are ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""So Emotional"". I LOVE ""When you put your hands on me"" and ""what a girl wants!"" BUY IT NOW!"
4,Christina lets Her Inner 'Genie' out,"By far the best of the batch of girl singers from last year's pop explosion, Christina Aguilera made a name for herself with the slinky hit'Genie in a Bottle'. That song remains probably her best vocal performance to date, if only to remind us that she can show subtlety and charm when guided wisely by her producers. On the other hand ,she also enjoys being a graduate of the Mariah Carey School of Vocal Acrobatics, as she displays on such tunes as 'I Turn to You' and 'Reflection'. If she can get past the hollow over-emoting that she seems to admire so much, she can easily manage to sustain a commercially, and critically, successful career."
4,Not what I expected but it's still a good CD,I love this CD! I got it for Christmas and I started to listen to it and I liked it. I never thought I would ever get Christina Aguilara because I don't really like the song 'What A Girl Wants' I think it's way overplayed. But overall it's a good CD and you should get it.
3,Incredible Voice-Not so great songs,"Christina Aguilera has an incredible voice but she doesn't sing to such great songs. Some of them are o.k. like ""I Turn to You"" but the other ones are weird-A Girl for all Seasons? I think Christina should spend a little more time sorting out her lyrics on the next album. Overall, it's a pretty good album to buy. Some of the songs words are wacko- but Christina makes it sound good with her amazing voice."
4,I love the first & second song...,"I love the first song, ""Genie in a Bottle"",& the second song,""What a Girl Wants"", The other songs are a little disapionting, but over all, it makes for great dance music!!! It's MUCH MUCH better than Hanson!!!"
2,In all Honesty...,"She has a wonderful voice, and I really liked ""Genie in A Bottle."" However, the song's gotten overplayed on the radio and I got sick of it. The best song on the album is ""Reflection."" I love the ballads, but in contrast, the dance songs are a little head-acky (if you know what I mean)with the exception of ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""Come on Over."" I'm a little uncertain about ""Obvious,"" because it's nice but needs a little work. Maybe better music? ""So Emotional"" and ""I Turn to You"" were fantastic, but the reason I'm rating this two stars, is that I think she could obviously do better than that.I hope she will, and I wish her success."
3,Some of the lyrics are inapporiate,"The CD has some good songs, but my face would turn red if my parents listened to the CD. The beat and rythem are excellant. I will give credit to where it is deserved. The artist's has a good, clear voice but again I would hestaite before I purchase this CD."
3,Okay,"Everybody is saying that Christina Aguilera is better that Britney Spears, but I think Britney Spears is a better singer and a better dancer, people say she looks like a foney but she's just a teenager a lot of teenagers wears a lot of makeup and care about how they look. Besides if you people just care about looks you probably think Christina Aguilera is better because she's cuttier than Britney.I think that Christina and Aguilera are both good singers and I don't want to critizize them. If I were you though I would buy Britney stuff before Christina Aguilera"
3,"She is good, But she is no Britney Spears","This album is good, but I thought that it was going to be a little more of a catchy pop album. She does have a good voice, but she needs better songs. I do however, listen to this album frequently and really like most of the songs. If you are questioning buying her album, I would say ""Go for it""."
3,"Christina's great, but you can't see it in these songs...","I was somewhat disappointed with this album. It's obvious that Christina has an AMAZING voice and great range but this album just doesn't show it. And to tell you the truth, it kinda pisses me off. She's so talented but if these are the kinds of songs she's gonna stick to, she'll continue being your average teen pop star until she fades away. There's one song she always sings in concert that's not on the cd (I can't think of the name though!) that really shows her amazing talent. So while I think Christina herself is great, I can't speak so highly of this album."
5,an atomic bomb that is yet to be exploded!,"her voice is definatly very very strong, she has a great voice and most importanly she knows how to use it. so if you are looking for an album that has all diffrent kinds of music, try this one. it has soft ballads to dance to pop to R&B. believe me you wont be dissappointed."
4,"*great* voice, so-so songs.","Christina's got a wonderful voice, no doubt about it. But I'd prefer if she put away the clearly unoriginal pop songs (""Come on Over"", ""Love For All Seasons"", or ""Somebody's Somebody"") and showcased her vocals more. ""I Turn To You"" does just that, but after listening to that particular song many times, I've realized that it's not a very good SONG, I just really like the SINGER. Nice try, Christina, great for a debut, but next time let's show some new stuff. (I do like ""What A Girl Wants"" quite a lot, however.)PS> Comparing Christina to Britney: Christina has, unquestionably, a better voice, but even though their songs are made of the same material, I like the SONGS on Britney's new album (not old) better than on Christina's. Christina is also way overdue for some new stuff. And, what's with her fake Latina accent? I love her to pieces but it pisses me off!"
3,A promising hope,"It was always fair to deem all teen bubble-gum pop female singers, like Britney Spears and Mandy Moore, as just pretty packages for the mass music market. That was until Christina Aguilera exploded on to the scene with her more sophisticated style of pop music with ""Genie In A Bottle"". This young lass is hopeful and definitely the more talented one in the pool of today's teenage performers. The Grammy she received did justify her vocal talents. If you really haven't heard her, I'm telling you now that you should. Her style shows high influence from the days Mariah Carey could still hit off a high note. Nevertheless, Aguilera will eventually develop her own mature style as she moves on. This album is an impressive showscase of one of the millennium's future superstars. Dig into ""Genie In A Bottle"", ""I Turn To You"", ""Reflection"" and ""What a Girl Wants"" just to see why this one got away with the Grammy and NOT Britney Spears."
4,her best album,this is her best album. i like 8 out of 12 songs on this album and its amazing. a really great album and one of the best of the 90s
2,Not a good beginning.,"This album is not good, but it's not that bad.Christina's voice was already powerful, and songs like ""I turn to you"" and ""Reflection"" are great.But the majority of the songs are poor and meaningless.Forget this CD and buy rather ""Stripped"", which is so much better."
2,A Guilty Pleasure,"Even people who prefer legitimate music are entitled to own a few lame albums just for fun. Christina Aguilera's is a great choice for that category. The lyrics aren't exactly deep or meaningful, and the accompaniment is cheesy and awful. Christina's voice is the only thing that makes the terrible material bearable. If you liked the singles, you might want to pick up the album- it's all downhill from there, mind you, but it's a good selection for times when you don't want to think. Oh, and I love ""What a Girl Wants."""
5,Buy it NOW!,"My Gosh, i'm soooo glad i bought this album, where would i be without it? I love all the upbeat songs on here ('What a girl wants', 'Come on over', and 'When you put your hands on me'. The ballads are beautiful esp.'Turn to you' which shows off her AMAZING vocal talents. 'Somebody's somebody' and 'Blessed' are my faves as they stick in my head. This truly is a brilliant album, although some people don't like 'Obvious' for some reason, i personally love it. To finish off, DON'T compare this girl to Britney, they're both completely different and just as good as each other."
4,"No, she's not just an imitatiton of other ""arstist's""","Please, if you're going to criticize her, at least make the arguments legitimite. She has a fabulous voice, weak material, and will find her own style with time. Yes she is the vein of Mariah Carey, contrary to what Carey's fans may say. However, this is a double-edged sword, as Carey's material has gotten progressively weaker as the years have gone by."
3,NOT BAD BUT NOT THE BEST,"The only songs I listen to are ""Genie In A Bottle"", ""What A Girl Wants"", ""I Turn To You"", and ""Reflection"". The rest of the songs aren'tas good. I would rank her fourth in teen singers, following Jessica, Mandy, and Britney. I like her personality better than her singing."
4,The Best thing to come out of 99,"This album is a blend of pop,soul and r&b that can make your toes curl.She has talent even though time can only tell if she has staying power she is much better than her studio created counterparts (you know who I'm talking about).The energy you get from hearing her sing is amazing your just listening like whoa shes 17! And I've never seen her lip sync,shes a amazing dancer.Shes probably the Mariah Carey of the teen genre.If you have taste you need to go get this album."
5,My Thoughts!,I think that Christina is a very talented singer and I see a great future for her and I wish her the best of luck.
3,"Good Voice, Bad Type of Music for her to be singing","Christina Aguilera has a great voice. But I don't think she should be singing pop music. The songs on the CD have the same general content and only makes the buyer want to listen too it when they feel extremely shallow. With A voice like hers she should be singing the style of music that is ""So Emotional"" and not so much teeny-bopper friendly music"
4,Pretty good debut,"To be sure, nothing much was expected with Aguilera despite the success of ""Genie In A Bottle"". Although the song showed promise, no one was willing to bet that Aguilera could top that performance. Until Now. The album has several great tracks, including the 2 singles plus ""So Emotional"" and ""Love For All Seasons"". That isn't to say that the album doesn't have flaws. 2 or 3 tracks are not quite as convincing as the rest of the album, especially songs like the dopey""Love Will Save The Day"". But perhaps the best prat of the album is Christina. One of the best voices to emerge since Whitney and Mariah, Christina will go far in the music industry."
4,MOVE OVER BRITNEY!!!!THIS GIRLS IS THE BOMB!!!!,"I CANNOT BELIEVE PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THIS ALBUM!!! I THINK IT IS THE BOMB!!! SHE HAS MAGNIFICENT VOICE AND SHE IS ABLE TO DANCE WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE A ROBOT--LIKE SOMEONE ELSE THAT I WILL NOT NAME. I AM A TRUE R&B FAN, BUT HER ALBUM IS A MIXTURE OF BOTH R&B AND POP, GIVEN THE WAY SHE SAANGS EVEN THE POP TRACKS SOUND GOOD!! EVERYONE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON HER TALENT AND NOT THE WAY SHE LOOKS!!! COME ON PEOPLE, GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS, DON'T HATE ON THE GIRL!!! CHRISTINA, DO YOUR THANG GIRRL!!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"If you like soothing ballads, this is the CD for you. I like only a couple of these songs like of course ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""Blessed"" She is a wonderful singer!"
5,One Awesome CD,"Christina's debut CD is simply awesome. She has an amazing voice that none of the other teen stars can match. Genie is a great opening track and the rest of the CD is able to keep up with it (for the most part). Her voice sounds the best in the ballads--I Turn To You, Reflection and Obvious. Its clear why so many of the singles from this CD have made it to the #1 spot. The weakest songs are So Emotional and When You Put Your Hands On Me, but they're not bad. Unlike other recent stars, Christina actually makes music. I highly reccomend this CD over almost any other. I look forward to her next CD."
4,3.5 actually; Christina does Whitney Houston,"Christina imitates Whitney Houston in many of her songs and two of the songs are Houston's. One is talented if they can imitate Houston, however critics should point out that that is indeed an imitation. But in all fairness to Houston Christina does not have the full range of Whitney Houstons voice: e.g. listen to Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" or her earliest hit ""Greatest Love of All"". The various awards shows give credit to the Christina songs that are not imitations of Houston e.g. Genie in a Bottle and What a Girl Wants and I think that is fair. Other than that for those songs which she does not do an imitation she does it well."
2,Ummmmm NO......,"Christina's voice isn't bad, but she carries out the songs for soooo long they never end. She tries to much like to be Mariha Carey and maskes her own talent. The relesed singles aren't bad but don't reflect the rest of the aweful album. If you are an interested buyer I'd pass on this one."
3,Great voice,"When Christina first came out with her songs, ""genie in a bottle"", I thought she was just like all the rest of the female pop stars. A pretty face and body but not a good singing voice. How wrong I was. Christina actually has a singing voice fit to be a career singer. Although this CD is your basic female pop star album. The general public found a singer worth listening to just for her Vocal ability alone."
4,overall good,"Not very bad. Better than britney definately in terms of originality, sound, and vocal talent. Christina has a powerful, genuine voice however at times she tries waaay to hard trying to be diva-like and streching those ""screams"" of hers. Annoying to some extent. Perhaps another bubble-gum pop stunt from the US to milk its money's worth BUT this album has alot more RnB feel to it. Not a perfect album, but recommended to pop/rnb listeners."
4,One of the best blond voices out there!,"Christina Aguilera... how can I describe the amazing voice of this talented 19 year old? With all of the blonds popping up everywhere, she is without a doubt one of the best. ""Genie in A Bottle"" is a song that will have you dancin and singing from the start. The same goes for ""Come on Over"". The best song on this albulm is ""Reflection""! You'll be hooked from the start. ""Obvious"" is another great one. ""Love for all Seasons"" is good too. Basically, this girl can sing!"
4,A wonderful voice!,"Christina Aguilera has a voice with a tremendous range that carries the whole CD. I enjoyed this CD from the start, with songs like ""Genie In A Bottle"", ""What A Girl Wants"" and ""Reflection"" leadng the way to an impressive debut. Christina seems to pattern herself after Mariah Carey and on some songs almost sounds like Mariah or maybe Whitney. The songs on this CD are better than most of the ones on Britney's CD and Christina never misses a beat. This girl is a powerful, young talent who should be around for many years and her CD is almost a must have for Pop fans."
2,Great voice but..,"I bought this CD after hearing What a Girl Wants. While I think she's got a great voice, I was disappointed with the rest of the CD. I'm in my mid-twenties and the music is aimed at a much younger generation."
4,You Go Girl!,"Well, this compact disc is great to listen to during any mood! Christina's music can help you relax or clean the house! I encourage you to by it. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was how ""What a Girl Wants"" sounds different from the version they play on the radio. (It's slower and doesn't have as much beat) But, I really don't care, 'cause the rest of the c.d. is wonderful!"
4,=),"Hey, I like Christina Aguilera. Before I didn't though. Her song Genie in a Bottlegot really overplayed, and it's really annoying to me, but her other songs such as Blessed or What A Girl Wants are good, I just hope they don't get overplayed too. Over all this CD is really good and I would buy it within reason. Thanx!"
3,different than Britney,Christina's debut is her best effort as a bubblegum pop/teen pop artist. Reflection is a beautiful song!
2,christina slaguilera,"Like OMG this girl like needs to get a life, she has like noooooooo fashion sense and she like totally needs to re do her hairstyle, like hello get a grip reality girlfriend!!! i really just need to say that although she has an average singing voice she really needs to like sort out all of her other aspects in like life and take a rain check on her album and 'pop star' career at the moment. i also think that like she sees herself as a pop princess but then tries to be like justin and does like all the r n b music that is basically like 'OMG you really need to get out more girlfriend and see like what the normal people of the world like and want to hear, and not what you think that your mum would like .... ok!!!!!!!!!"
3,It was a good CD!,I think that Christina Aguilera did a good job on her CD. I think that you should buy her CD. You will really in joy it.
2,"Nice Try, Hon, But Still No Trophy","First, the good stuff: Christina Aguilera's debut has two first-rate singles: ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""What a Girl Wants."" Both songs have personality, spunk, and they nicely compliment Aguilera's powerful voice. But it's Snoozeville from here. ""I Turn to You"" is just a dreary ballad (it's written by Diane Warren--big shocker), and not much else on the album catches fire. It's a particularly frustrating listen, considering how vocally talented Aguliera really is. I just hope she won't go the way of 1990's Mariah and settle for goopy ballads and soulless dance tunes that do her no justice."
3,She's Got A Great Voice But The Music Is Terrible,"Excuse me for a minute but I have to gripe about the incredible waste of talent here. Unlike her counterpart Britney Spears, Christina actually has talent and a lot of it. RCA records basically gave her one good song to sing and the rest of the songs are absolutely terrible. Given the mediocrity of the music on this album it's a wonder she sold any albums at all.Ok this album should be bought only to hear Christina's amazing voice. The only good song on this album is ""Genie In A Bottle"". The rest of the tracks on this album basically suck lyrically and musically. If they were actually any good then why did RCA remix her last 3 singles to make them more radio airplayable? If you are getting this because you like the stuff you've heard on the radio then save your money and go buy the singles. If you want to hear a great voice then get this album and you won't be disappointed."
2,nothing you haven't heard before!,...This album contains so much filler. The hit singels which are bad. Except for Genie In A Bottle. Her voice is not good either. ...The music is not good and the ballads are laughable...
2,It's not all that,"The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is for effort... personally, the album needs a lot of help. All the songs are slow (except genie), so if you crave pop/dance and or beautiful ballads that bring tears to your eyes, then this is not the album for you. It just doesn't get it- some of her songs sound like you've already heard them, (i.e. Whitney, Mariah). I actually think Britney Spears' album is more interesting, and her voice drives me nuts! Riding ""Genie in a bottle"" 's success will be easy, but I'm sure she'll be gone before long. So better luck next time, CA."
2,Borrow from a friend first,"I, myself, made the mistake of buying this cd first. I like(d) ""Genie In A Bottle"", but the rest of the album isn'tas good as that song. i found myself getting tried for Aguilera's voice. And, she really isn't like Britney Spears, who people compare her to. (I happen to like Britney's music better, it has more edge.) Some of the songs on this album sound out of place of some-sorts. But, on the other hand, there are some other good tunes. Moreover, ""Genie"", a good choice for the first single, in my opinion is the song stand-out good song on the album."
2,It's grea........alright.,"Its a good album I will say, she does have an excellent voice, but she is just another artist who will be lost in 10 years. Did you see her at the VMA's she looked like she worked on the street corner."
2,Promising,"Not exactly someone who will be around for a long time. But this album is definitely better than Britney Spears's junk. However this album lacks consistency and theme. This is one album you know you will listen to it for a while and then cold-storage it forever until someone mentions her name again in the future. However, comparing to Britney Spears's CD, this is a gem after all..."
4,Christina is really talented!,"This girl can really sing for a white girl. She has a good voice and a strong one too, and she has real talent, and is the only pop star with a real voice. The best songs are #1,2, 4,5, and especially 7. Though she tries too hard to be like Mariah and Whitney Houston, her role models, she can really sing. I am going to get her second album because I know that I will enjoy it. Go Christina!"
4,What a voice!,"I love her new release, I turn to you. But you know what? All her songs are positive and just a wonderful natural sounding type of music to listen to. Sure, britney was here first, but who wants to hear someone who must have a cold 24/7 from what she sounds like? When Christina sings, she blasts her notes. I write and sing music, and I know that singing notes the way she does is hard (I don't have trouble with brit, except the computer [effects] she always throws in). I just find her to be a positive and long lasting model for girls, and even boys."
2,"Genie in a Bottle is great, but that's about it",The rest of the CD is trash. The songs all sound the same and none are very compelling. You can't really listen to it all the way through without getting annoyed.
3,"Not one of my favorites, but pretty good","I was really into getting this CD and when I got it I was partially impressed. I love her voice but was a little bit disappointed with some songs that sound too teeny even though she's close to around that age. She's got good potential though. Some of my fave tracks are Genie In A Bottle, So Emotional, and Reflection."
4,Pretty Good For A Debut,"Already sold 9 Million, and still going.Genie In A Bottle~A Hit, So it's good. It's got clever lyrics and good meaning, ****What A Girl Wants~I like it, it's practically her theme song, but it gets old. ***I Turn To You~I like this one, good ballad. ****So Emotional~Cool Track, Great Lyrics, ****Come On Over Baby~Perfect!!! What more do you want me to say! *****Obvious-Too Slow, but I like it. ***Love Will Find A Way~**** VERY nice song that shows off her vocals.Sorry if I forgot a song but I can review again. Go by what's there.~Twin"
4,?????????,"This CD was pretty good. My favorite ones were the ones played on the radio, so if you liked those you will probably like the whole CD. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is the fact that it was all slow songs at the end, and a mix in the beginning, so their is more slow songs than fast. Some people that would't bother, I just like the fast songs best. If you are looking at this CD and you weren't sure because you mostly like adult contemperary, I recommend it."
4,Not a Bad Cd...,"I liked this cd much better than for example Britney Spears. Christina has a great voice, and it shows, like in her song ""Reflections,"" which she sang the song for the movie ""Mulan"" soundtrack. However, if you are a kid, like me, I would recommend staying away from the more mature songs, like ""When You Put Your Hands On Me."" I do like the songs ""Genie in a Bottle,"" ""What a Girl Wants,"" Number 3, ""Come On Over,"" ""Reflections"" and ""Love for all Seasons."" I also recommend her newest album, ""Mi Reflejo."""
2,Okaaaaay,"Most of songs are just bubblegum music. However, she is one of the brave activists who has tried to stop Britney Spears from taking over the world, and I have to give her credit for that."
4,Cool CD,"This CD is really cool. It has a lot of great songs. My favorties are Turn to You, What A Girl Wants, Come on Over, and Reflection. Some of the songs are kinda slow, like I Turn to You, but some are faster, like Come On Over. It's good for people who like a mixture of slow and fast songs"
2,"Hmmmm, So-so","I liked the first single a lot but since then all her releases have got less good. Much of the album is drippy ballards, which are no good at all."
4,Pop explosion,"I think this album was a good stepping stone into the industry during the pop explosion. It was meant to be fun not serious. Her label admitted that they were staging her career after Britney Spears because of her success. They were in control of everything. Christina did put her say-so in it every-now-and-then. Christina admitted that she wasn't thinking about having her own style, sound etc. She just wanted the world to her voice. She did get four #1 top singles from the album and a Grammy though. The comparisons to Britney caused her to rebel against her label by changing her image and take hold of her career."
5,Christina Aguilera - Good CD!,Hello I'm an autistic adult.I gotta admit Christina Aguilera is a really good singer she makes some pretty decent song's.These are my favorite:1. Genie In A Bottle2. What A Girl Wants3. I turn to youAlot of her song's are just plain out awesome!Buy this cd you'll really enjoy it.
4,BETTER OF THE CHRISTINA CDS,"I THINK GENIE IN THE BOTTLE IS ONE OF CHRISTINAS BETTER CDS. SINCE THIS IS HER FIRST CD AND SHE WAS VERY YOUNG I FEEL THAT SHE EXPRESSED HER TRUE TALENT. HER VOICE IS SO POWERFUL. THERES LOTS OF GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM. MY FAVORITE IS ""I TURN TO YOU"". THIS SONG HAS A WAY OF MAKING SOMEONES BAD DAY TURN INTO A GOOD DAY. AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH I LOVE BRITNEY SPEARS I THINK CHRISTINA WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER. THIS IS A GREAT CD. YOU SHOULD GET IT."
2,Only 3 good songs...,"The only songs that I liked were Genie, Girl Wants and Reflection. The rest is pop filler. Christina's voice is okay but the material (other than the tracks above) isn't anything special or original. It's true that Christina sings circles around the other white teen singers (Britney, Jessica & Mandy) but her voice isn't complimented by any of this throw-away bland music. She is very Mariah Carey-isk at times and soars during breaks, but cannot completely shine on this material. The last note of the last song is is an example, but it's a shame that it's the only good part of the song, plus the music ends weird, likes there should be more. I would love to have that Christmas song included on the album to add another quality track but I guess I'll have to deal with the this 3 song album. She's no Shanice or Monica, but Christina does has potential. She just needs better material."
3,Christina's cd rocks,"Christina totally has emotion and soul in her music. I thought Britney Spears was good, but when I heard Christina, Britney sounded like a little kid singing, Christina has a more mature voice and she does express it. If you like ""What A Girl Wants,"" then I strongly recommend the remix if you haven't already heard it. Rock on Christina!"
3,Alright!,"Christina Aguilera isn't bad at all. I wouldn't go as far as Calling her the next Mariah or Whitney, but she's alright. Her voice is nice, but not all it's ment to be. It's string, but she lacks some skills when singing live. Other than that, not a bad album. Has a lot of pop & lil' R&B, but It's a good album. She shows she has staying power with ""I Turn To You"" & ""Love For All Seasons"""
2,She's Getting There,"Christina has a gorgeous voice, no doubt about that. But I really hate her songs, lyrics, music whatever. She also is such a major copycat. Britney was here first and Christina's getting the Grammy and the credit. If you want to get the CD, then definitely listen to the clips first. Then decide. But I definitely reccomend Britney Spears' and Jessica Simpson's CD. They both have great voices but as a bonus...they're songs are actually worth listening too."
2,"""She turns to me"", and spray my face with her angry screams","I thought she was good. I thought she was very good. She sounded great and talented in her record. But if you ever had the chance to hear her live performances. When she sang the song ""I turn to you"", she destroys it with her seemingly angry yells and overly exuberant energies. It is a soft love song, Miss Aquelira, I need to remind you. We want to hear your emotions and feelings, not your hard, tough notes with screams mixed in between. Believe me, they will not spice your songs up. The record sounds good, but she oversings it in her live performances Soft it up a little"
2,Tremedous Promise for what? Being DIRRRRRRTTTYYY!?!!,"This Album is good in the sense of all her released songs are cool: ""Genie"",""What a girl wants"",""Come on over"",""Reflection"", all the rest is absolutely boring like her next CD, yes she has tremedous talent, but when people compare her to Britney then they are fooled by what Christina is now, really dirrty like in ""Dirrty"" and ""Cant hold us down"" videos. This CD is boring 97% it will put me to sleep more than counting sheep over a fence does!Fans will NOT agree with me!"
2,I don't think so,"The only reason I'm giving her two stars is for trying. The only good songs are ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""What a Girl Wants"". I asked my friend if he could bring it over to my house to see how it was, I didn't like it. Besides, I can't stand her voice. I think this CD is a waste of money, but hey, you're free to think she's the best singer in the world, but for me, she's at the bottem of my list."
1,Want to give it 0 stars,I bought this album after everyone kept comparing her to my fav. singer Britney. Except her voice and lyrics it's crap compared to Britney's albums. Her voice is a gift she was born with and no effort of hers. Britney's voice is crap but her songs are way more better. This self-titled abum has the same sort of songs except my fav- Genie in the bottle. Britney's better anyday and has a bigger variety of songs. Please don;t waste your money only to listen to her beautiful voice. Just download the songs. Buy any of britney's albums.
5,This album made me a fan!,"What a beautiful voice! In a world of teeny-boppy, no-talent new-comers, it's so good to hear a strong voice break through. Christina is really talented. Also, it's refreshing to hear songs that are just happy and spirit-lifting instead of full of hate, curses and depression. She's a diva to watch. Brittany can only get so far with her looks, she's got no talent."
4,2000 Grammy Award Winner for Best New Artist deserved it.,"Mother likes this girl better than she ever did Mariah Carey because she isn't as fresh as Mariah, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, or those other revealing young girls out there, and she hits those high notes without showing off, like Mariah does."
5,very cool!,"Christina Aguilera is the best singer ever! she has great music and lyrics and she has the best voice, She deserves to be #1!"
5,The cd is the bomb!,"The Cd is The bomb!Before few people new her Cd! But then it happend, As the cd Blasted of on the music charts!Into the cd history Books!Its all of course a due to a little ditty called,Im a genie in a Bottle Babay!Blasted into the cd #1 charts!Cristina Augilera is also would love to do a duet with madona on her new cd! but so forward the cd that she has is great!"
4,Major superstar potential,"I just bought this today and am listening to it right now. Christina has mega-potential to be a long-lasting superstar. The song ""I Turn To You"" has potential to be a major, major hit. ""Blessed"" is a very nice, laid-back, graceful tune. ""So Emotional"" grew on me. It has a nice groove. ""Come On Over"" is very catchy. She has an incredible voice. She's only 18, so she can have a long career ahead of her. For her next effort, she could do with some less-surfacy songs. Watch out for her. She could be the next superstar female singer."
4,Good CD but in need of some upbeat tempos,"This is a great CD and Christina has a goregous voice, but where are the fast paced songs? Come Over is the fastest song that has a good, dancable beat to it. Overall though the CD is great, just wish there were some faster songs."
3,Cd wasn't worth the money,"I bought the cd after i heard Genie in a bottle, what a girl wants is ok and the song so emotional is a great dance song! but all the others are pretty pathetic! the beginning of her songs are to slow! Anyway i think you should go for the single! Thanx!"
2,"Not bad, but not great.","It's not that she can't sing. She can. It's just that only 2 or 3 of the songs are worth buying. The others are filler. Christina's evil twin, Britney Spears, had the same problem with her album. She's not a bad singer, and the title track and 1 or 2 others were good. The rest, though, are boring and only there to fill out a full-length record. Then again, these are kids. I hope they both release solid sophomore efforts."
4,"""Come on over"" to the store and BUY CHRISTINA AGUILERA!","Personally, I don't think that Genie is the best song in the world. It's mediocre. ""Blessed"" is the one that should REALLY be the hit! She is NOT a Britney S. copy! If Christina came first and Britney came second, the people who say that she copied her would say that BRITNEY copied her! Give the kid a break. She's cool. But don't waste your time on any songs but these: Genie, Blessed, So Emotional, What A Girl Wants, Reflection, Come On Over. CHRISTY LIVE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Beautiful voice, Terrible songs","Christina is a truly talented girl, but she is just waisting her breath on this album. The only good song is ""Genie..."", and she didn't even write it. Bubblegum Pop is appealing to most young people, but in the long run won't get an artist anywhere. Christina should ditch her record label and start writing her own songs... songs that come from the heart. Maybe then her voice will sound even better then it already does."
4,genie in a bottle is one of the best songs i have heard,"christina aguilera's songs are incredible, she has a wonderful voice, and tremendous dancing, i love all her songs, and hope she goes farther , with more great songs"
3,If only the songs were as good as her voice....,"or at least if all the songs were as good as ""genne in a bottle"".......if it wasn't for that AMAZING voice, and a few good songs, i wouldn't recommend this cd to anyone.....but if you're going to buy it because of Gennie in a bottle, then ou should better listen to the whole cd before buying it....otherwise you'll probably be very dissapointed."
3,Weak.,"I found these songs to just be re-hashing of already been done pop-like songs from Whitney Houston to Mariah Carey. Same old stuff. I was also disappointed to realize that she doesn't even write her own lyrics or produce her own music. It's all done for her by writers and studioo exec-tupes. She's a very good singer, I'll grant her that, but way over-hyped. Gimme a band like Earth Crisis or Rage Aaginst the Machine who at least write their own music, write their own lyrics, and have incredible passion and unbridled energy behind their music. Now, that's impressive and what attracts me most to a musical act--pop or not. Those guys tear it up and have an important social message to boot! I'll give her three stars for encouragement. --Kelly Magovern"
5,"With such a beautiful voice, Christina Aguilera is a keeper.","When I first purchased this cd,I was prepared for Britney Spears like bubble gum pop.And as I listen to the first track I smiled.But the second track made my grin fade as I punch the ""next"" button. ""I Turn To You"" chased away my worries.Whitney/Mariah/Celine flashed through my mind.As the cd played on,I smiled in relief.Yep,the eighteen year old ex-Disney princess was a keeper.As I listened in,I particulary enjoied the upbeat ""Love Will Find A Way"" and the ballady ""Obvious"".The only song that plucked my feathers was the raunchy ""When You Put your Hands On Me"". The positive message and beautiful Christina exerts in this cd is a joy to sore ears and a brings a smile to every face."
3,hehehe hoo hoo ha ha,"I think christian music is better than this corny, mushy, pointless, shallow music. On that note I have to say that two of my three stars for this cd belong to the cover. aye chiuaua. the other one goes to the semi-cool beat in genie in a bottle, which I've only heard due to a radio station that plays it almost as much as ""la vida loca""."
5,underdog wins the race,"So Britney is the popular favorite right now - big deal. She'll be gone before you know it. Madonna was the underdog to Debbie Gibson. She who's still respected and popular, and look who else disappeared and went through depression? Christina Aguilera is the best talent find in decades. She will undoubtedly become the next huge diva, and this debut album shows it."
5,Great Voice!,"Christina Aguilera probably has the best voice out of Britney Spears and Mandy Moore.She also sounds really good live which shows she is not overproduced. There are soulful, kind of gospel like songs on this CD : Somebody's Somebody, Love Will Find A Way, Blessed, and Obvious. Her voice really shines in the ballads I Turn To You and Reflection that shows that this girl can sing. When You Put Your Hands On Me is an upbeat song with her voice sounding like a machine at some points, but it's a kewl song. So Emotional is a laid back song. The versions of Come On Over and What A Girl Wants are different than the radio versions, just to let you know. The only song I don't like is Love For All Seasons, it sounds kinda corny to me. If you like Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston this is the CD you should get. If you're expecting sugary pop you shouldn't get it because it's more of soulful stuff."
2,"beautiful voice, awful CD","Christina Aguilera is underestimated for these reasons:1) She's skinny, blonde, and bubbly. 2) She has a rather awful pop album.This girl has a beautiful voice. (Don't believe me? Go listen to her version of Etta James' ""At Last"".) Her talent is undeniable. But this album was obviously an attempt by her record company to fit her into the Britney Spears mold.The differences between Spears and Aguilera? Spears has minimal talent and beauty that will fade. It's easy to see Christina in 10 or 20 years as a beautiful older woman with an incredible voice. She is destined to be a diva, as long as her record company starts giving her more control.(...)As you listen to this album, you can hear her voice wanting to come out, and it's frustrating.The closest you get to hearing Aguilera's true talent is ""I Turn To You"". Bleh. Diane Warren.Let's hope the next CD is better.Pray for Christina."
2,Oh God! Not another one!....,"Ok, first her good point. Her voice makes Britney Spears sound almost hoarse! Her voice has a clear quality about it that's even there when she performs live! I'm sorry, but some singers lose that quality, she doesn't!Know, on to the pointless stuff. She is trying so hard not to be seen as a Britney Spears clone, but when you disect her songs, that's exactly what she is. Her voice is far superior, but most of the songs don't enhance that. The lyrics of the songs are just as important as the way you sing them, and I'm not hearing any sort of variety beyond the traditional pop lyrics.So, Christine, here's hoping that you get to sing a wider variety of music!"
2,Weak debut.,"Christina Aguilera's debut album had some really cheesy and manufactured songs. She sold a lot of albums and won a Grammy for Best New Artist, and the girl can sing her damn heart out but this album is pure candy-coated fluff. The songwriting is horrible, songs like Come On Over (All I Want Is You), Genie In a Bottle, What A Girl Wants, When You Put Your Hands On Me, and I Turn To You, these songs never make you want to come back for me. Only three tracks prove X-tina can belt, Blessed, Reflection, and So Emotional. This album didn't showcase what this girl could really do, it's disposal pop and I am so glad they don't make this kind of music anymore."
3,Christina Aguilera's self-titled album is clearly overhyped,"When I initially purchased Christina Aguilera's self-titled album I was ecstatic. Yet, after I listened to this album several times I noticed that most of the songs were lifeless."
5,What Everyone Wants!,"It would be easy to categorise Christina with the likes of Britney Spears, Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson but unlike them she has a true vocal ability. Christina will be around for a long time and will eventually take Mariah Carey's crown as Queen of Pop. The debut album Christina Aguilera acts as a showcase for her vocals and hints at what is in store for the fans on the next album - that is strong harmonies, gorgeous vocals and catchy tunes. There is not one bad song on the album and some are reminiscent of the old Mariah tunes. From the beautiful ""I Turn To You"" to the upbeat ""Come On Over"", Christina Aguilera is an album that will please a lot of people with it's range of musical genres and arrangements. The highlight is Christina wide vocal range - boy can she hit the high notes! It is a very well produced and put together album and it is a very promising, strong debut. Hail Christina the queen of pop!"
5,Christina is MY girl!,"After listening to greats like Mariah and Celine, Christina tops them all with her amazing voice! Don't be fooled by her teen-pop singles, she is a true diva!"
3,"Too Much Soul, Not Enough FUN!","One of the great things about having an 8 year old daughter is purchasing a Cd like this, and even if you don't like it, not feel that you've wasted your money.While I was drawn to Genie in a Bottle & What a Girl Wants, the CD goes right into pure, slow soul/r&b. Not that that's bad, just a bit disappointing and boring. Christina has a nice voice & will undoubtablely be compared to Mariah & Whitney, but at her age, shouldn't she be having a bit more fun? The Cd doesn't really pick up again until Love Will Find a Way, which is just Dream Lover redone, much like the pleasant Love for all Seasons, which sounds just like Angel of Mine. The Cd tops off with the obligatory ballad. Just a quick bit of advice from my era, Christina...Girls just want to have fun!"
4,pop songs,man this girl can sing. yeah its pop songs so it gets old quick but these songs are cute and fun. enjoy
3,A Good Start,"Although the cd is not a great cd ( I have to say that you may not like the majority of the songs), but what do you expect from a young star's debut album? Hits like ""What a girl wants"", and ""Genie in a bottle"" are already enough for average young stars to be famous. The difference between her and other young pop stars is that she CAN sing(She has a great voice)This album is not perfect, but you can buy just so you can remember how she has been when she has better works out. It's a good start."
4,Better than I would have thought,"I Never in a million years would've guessed that this CD would be the next one I would buy. But I was really surprised by how good it is! Although, I must say I don't really care for the ever-popular ""Genie In A Bottle."" I think the song sends a mixed message to young girls. It supposedly tells them to have respect for themselves, but it's produced sound has a very sexy and provocative beat to it. One reason I used to despise this teen singer. Now however, I realize that she really does have talent, once I skip past the first track. Once I heard some of her other songs, I thought that her voice was quite powerful. I do love ""What A Girl Wants,"" ""I Turn To You,"" and ""Reflection."" I'm glad I decided to give her a chance after all. Congrats Christina on the Grammy!"
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"i heard alot of good things about this cd so i thought 'what the heck? i'll buy it'. big mistake. christina has a beautiful voice but the songs were just not good at all. besides ""what a girl wants"" the only song i liked was ""reflection"". i'm sorry but this CD was WAAAAAAAAAY over-rated. i hope her next CD is better then this one. if you are a die hard fan then go for it, buy it, but if your not really a fan at all then save your money because i can honestly say that you will be hugely dissapointed in this CD."
5,THE BEST!,"This is my favorite CD in the entire world. At first I just bought it because of the song ""Genie in a Bottle"", but now that is actually one of my least favorite on the CD. My favorite is probably ""Come on Over"". Don't be confused... this is different and a lot better than Shania Twain's song. The beat is totally awesome! Once you hear it, you won't be able to get it out of your head! Christina's video's are great too. She has a voice better than Mariah Carey's, she has better dance moves than the backsteet boys, and better songs than Brittany Spears. Even my parents like her songs (In fact, they just turned it on and I didn't even ask them to)!This is about the only album we can all agree on. All my friends love to watch her videos with me. The lyrics in ""Reflection"" and ""Somebody's Somebody"" are really meaningful. If you like pop, slow, or dance music YOU HAVE TO GET THIS! Trust me on this one."
3,"Not the best, not the worst...","well...If you want here somebody screaming all the time, this is the right cd for you!!!Christina has a powerfull voice, is true but in my opinion(!) is...ugly. I reaaly don't appreciate hearing her, but..that is just me!This album isn't the best album outhere but it isn't the worst...My favourite one is ""obvious"", because i had i time in my life that was like that...Now is with you..."
5,christinafan,"Christina'a Cd is great 1. Genie in a bottle-good and first single. 2. What a Girl Wants-second single-the remix, 3. I turn to you-ballad and third single. 4. So Emotional-A good pop song. 5. Come on over baby (all i want is you) another remix and fourth single. 6. Reflections- she did this song at age 17. 7. Love for all seasons- a all year song. 8. Somebody's Somebody- a mood track. 9. When you put your hands on me- a stay up late song. 10. Blessed- A pop song to go with popcorn. 11. Love Will Find a way- A another song to go with. 12. Obvious- the last track. If you are a Christina fan, then get this CD right away."
4,great voice,"I really don't like pop music. But I think Christina is a great singer.Her voice doesn't sound as mechanical as Britney or BSB. And unlike the other's songs, they're not full of complaining and whining about being lonely and wanting your old lover back.I think she has great talent.She also is a fan of cool rock bands like KoRn who is one of my favorites."
3,I really like her songs....,"I like Christina Agulera a lot. But some of the songs have pretty bad lyrics. My absolute fav is "" What a girl wants"". Although some of the other songs can get a little boring. All in all I like the CD."
5,"""WHAT A FAN WANTS""","CHRISTINA AGUILERA'S DEBUT SELF-TITLED ALBUM IS EXECLLENT . HER VOICE TAKES YOU AWAY. WITH THE #1 SMASH""GENIE IN A BOTTLE"" AND THE NEW #1 SMASH ""WHAT A GIRL WANTS"" AND UP FOR 2 GRAMMYS,THE GIRL HAS A VOICE. THE BEST ONE ONE THE ALBUM IS ""LOVE FOR ALL SEASONS"" ,""COMEON OVER"",AND""I TURN TO YOU"" THIS ALBUM SHOULD STAY ON THE TOP 10 FOR A LONG TIME!"
4,Potential Talent,"Christina Aguilera should NOT be compared to Britnet Spears simply because (as is obvious from her debut album) she can actually SING and has a voice.My favorite tracks on the album other than the first single are Turn To You, Reflection, Blessed and Obvious. But honestly I love the entire album. She does try to imitate Mariah Carey. But she is the only one who is capable enough to attempt to do so. Not since Mariah Carey has anyone arrived in the music scene with such a potential powerhouse voice and ability to perform. She is ""almost"" like Carey minus the seven octaves."
3,ok cd,"this cd is okay. a lot of the songs are sorta boring ballads though. if you like her 2 singles, ""genie in a bottle"" and ""what a girl wants"", those are basically the only 2 pop songs. the rest are more soul/r&b. so buy it if you like that music, otherwise i suggest getting the singles."
4,Christina Rocks,"This is an awesome cd. She has an amazing vocal talent and ability. She puts emotion and depth into her music, unlike Britney who tries to, but sounds like she's whining. If you like the song ""What a girl wants"" then check out the remix version."
3,"Pretty good...not the best, not the worst","Okay, to tell you the truth, this CD IS pretty good. It's WAY better than Hanson, LeAnn Rimes, Mandy Moore, etc. but it's worse than Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, Five, etc. I especially like the song ""Love Will Find A Way"" and stuff like that so I'll just say that I'm satisfied with the CD and glad that it wasn't a really a rip-off. So... I have nothing more to say..."
2,it may be a one hit wonder,"I really like her but the only good song there is ""genie in the bottle"".she really needs to start working with some better song if she wants to have another hit."
4,What an ambitious debut for Christina Aguilera!,"What an ambitious debut for Christina Aguilera! She sure has come a long way from her days on the Mickey Mouse Club. Beginning witht the first track, ""Genie in a Bottle"", this record has a little bit of everything. From ballads, to songs you can dance to, it treats the listener to different sounds. On ballads such as the Diane Warren penned ""I Turn To You"", Christina can exhibit her voice which is seasoned and sultry. Along with the song ""Reflections"" from the soundtrack to the Disney film Mulan, ""Blessed"" is one of the tracks on the album which is a terrific song that appeals to all ages. A definate recommendation to those unsure. This record is sure to exceed expectations."
1,"Great voice,forgettable songs....","The only thing she has that Britney doesn't is a good powerful voice,but she's still singing semi-funky bubblegum Mickey Mouse songs..The less clothes she wears,the more boring she is...Hopefully,she'll fade away and maybe do Vegas or a strip show.Or just fade away period!! BORING!!"
1,Let's Put the Genie back in the Bottle,"Christina Aguilera came out at a good time for ""Teen Pop."" When Christina came out Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys were dominating the charts. Teen boys and girls needed another female artists. Well they got Christina Aguilera. I bought the album because of the poptastic ""Genie In a Bottle."" I listened to the cd and I must say it was horrible. Some of the worst tracks were ""I Turn To Yo"" and ""So Emotional."" At least Britney doesn't try to be Mariah Carey. My choice would be to buy a Britney cd. But here's a review of the 4 singles off the cd. One * being the lowest and five * being the highest.""Genie In a Bottle"" - *""What a Girl Wants"" - *""I Turn To You"" - *1/2""Come On Over"" - **"
1,Bad,"Don't buy this album. Christina's old image is cheesy pop and you should see her new album, ""Dirrty!"" Please buy her new cd and her new single, ""Fighter!"" The song is better then this whole cd!!!! Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Good,"Sure Christina has a good voice,but a good cd? No way!I was excited to get this cd after hearing Gini in a Bottle and What a Girl Wants but once I listened to it I instantly took it out of my cd player. Hardly any songs are good or catchy. If you want to get a good pop album buy a Britney Spears cd."
5,The Best Album Around,"Christina Aguileras debut album is one of the best albums around.It's actulley the best album i own.(and i own ALOT of albums)The album is filled with ballards,dance,pop and r'n'b tracks which will make you never want to turn this wonderful album off.If you are not a Christina fan,i can safely say once you have a listen at this album you will become a fan before you can say Christina Aguilera.Every single song is brilliant. My personal favourites being 'Come on over'(All i want is you), 'Blessed','Love will find a way','I turn to you' and 'Genie in a bottle' G-d,i LOVE them all.Well,as you can see from my review Christinas debut album ROCKS and i look forward to more of her upcoming releases.CHRISTINA RULES!"
3,This blonde can sing!,"Genie In A Bottle: Really awesome song, but after it's put on MTV, VH1, and radio stations every day, well then it get's tiring; including having it on the CD What A Girl Wants: The remix is cool, and that high note is fabulous! I would continue but I gotta go!"
5,Christina Aguilera. Third Copy of Album. All Three Copies Purchased Right Here On Amazon.,"""Christina Aguilera"" is very juvenile and very teen, but the rhythms and lyrics are very catchy and I can't stop lisening to it. My favorite tracks are ""Genie In A Bottle"", ""What A Girl Wants"", ""I Turn To You"", ""So Emotional"", ""Come On Over (All I Want Is You""), ""Reflection"", ""Love For All Seasons"", ""When You Put Your Hands On Me"", ""Blessed"" and ""Obvious"", although I never skip a track. Obviously songs are all 10/10 for me. I was lucky that the last two copies I got of this album here on Amazon were the copies that contained the video versions of ""What A Girl Wants"" and ""Come On Over (All I Want Is You)"" because the first copy I got, two months after the album was released, in 1999, obviously contained the album versions and none of these videos had been released. I like this edition of the album better than the first one. Christina makes AWESOME music. Can't get enough of her music."
4,Pure soul,"When I first heard her voice, I was stunned. She shouldnt be compared to the talent-less Brittney Spears, Christina's voice is pure soul and r&b.;This album is one of my favorites. The best songs, in my opinion,had an R&B; flavor b/c that ultimately does her voice the most justice.So Emotional 10/10, Somebody's Somebody 9/10, Genie In a Bottle 7/10, Obvious 9/10, When you put your hands on me 9/10 and Reflectino 7/10 to me are the best tracks. Great buy!"
3,Chris,This product arrived in good condition as well as in a timely fashion. My son loved it and that's all that counts.
4,She IS A Diva--and Rightfully So!,"She is my favorite singer of all-time, other than Mariah Carey. I can't compare Christina to Britney, Christina sings way better than her, and has the Grammys to prove it!When I bought this CD in junior year in high school, the only song that I'd heard and liked was ""Genie In a Bottle"". The other tracks that I like are ""What A Girl Wants"", ""Reflection"", ""I Turn to You"", ""Come On Over"", ""So Emotional"", and of course, ""Obvious"".I love her voice! I know she has a long career ahead of her--I can't say the same for Britney."
4,Can you say Diva?,"Christina Aguilera, in my opinion, is the best new female pop artist. Girlfriend has soul...I mean she can really sing and she definitely proves it. She sings all of her songs very well. So what's the problem with her album? ""When you put your hands on me"" , ""Come on over"", and ""So emotional"". Boo- Boo-. The rest of her songs I dig, but those just aren't good. It's not the way she sings it, I just think it's the songs themselves, they weren't strong from the start. I wouldn't describe them as pitiful, or awful, just nothing as croonful as ""Genie in a bottle"" or ""What a girl wants""."
4,What a voice!,"I didn't really used to like CA at all, but I've got admit, she really grows on you. Even though I don't like all the songs on this cd, she has a excellent voice and I'm glad to see such talent compared to the limitations of many popstars out there today."
2,Not enough substance,"I have nothing against Christina, but most of her songs sound the same. It's time for some depth to come back to the music industry. I'm looking forward to it."
4,Don't Be Fooled-- This is Worth a Listen,"I didn't expect to enjoy this album the way that I did. I'm generally a fan of progressive rock, but the super production and crisp sound of Aguilera's voice really impressed me. The best track is the one that you've already heard-- ""Genie in a Bottle,"" but the rest of the CD is worth hearing. Nice beats, really great voice and fun lyrics that are just risque enough to make listening fun."
3,Second Best,"Quite frankly, i think that the only good songs on this album are Genie in a Bottle and Reflection. The rest are boring, slow and all the same ballad style. I think her amazingly powerful voice suits fast and dramatic songs rather than quiet and slow ones. She could do much better. Sorry Christina, but You're second best to Britney!"
4,she is an awesome dancer with an amazing voice,"First of all, i like to say i really enjoyed this CD, especially track number 6-reflection. She really has an awesome voice. Second of all, i dont understand what is the deal with all these comparsions betweeen christina and britney. Gosh why can't you guys just relax and enjoy both of their music. I am just a regular music fan who happens to love both of their music. They both are upcoming young music stars with different styles and characters. I think they both can stand on their own ground and there is no need to compare one with another. ok, that is all i have to say. Go out and buy this CD, it is definitely worth it. If you agree with me or disagree with me, i am open for opinions."
5,Christina Aguilera has great talent!,"Christina Aguilera has great talent and it shows in this CD. And as for the music fan from NY, NY who said that she is just average, I think that she is a million times better than Britney or Whitney or Jennifer or whomever else he listed! She will always be around because she has a great voice! p.s. BRITNEY SPEARS IS JUST AVERAGE!"
3,Not completely What a Girl Wants!,"I am going to admit that Christina has an amazingly strong voice. She prolly has the strongest and most developed voice out of the well known female pop singers today. And it definitely shows on the amazing ""Reflection"" from Disney's Mulan, and also on her breakthrough ""Genie in a Bottle"" and ""I Turn To You."" Other than those three songs, the CD is nothing to go crazy for. ""What a Girl Wants"" is good, but it is different from the really cool version you see on MTV and hear on the radio. I really like the song ""Blessed."" It is really original and catchy. The rest of the songs are really forgettable and kinda annoying. Especially the awful ""Come On Over."" The girl is really talented, but this CD is limited. I'm thinking she needs some better song writers that will let her show her talents the right way."
3,What a Girl Needs . . .,"Is a reality check. This album, and Ms. Aguilera herself, are both overproduced but extremely appealing to various subsets of the population. It's no wonder powderkeg smash ""Genie in a Bottle"" and its follow-up ""What a Girl Wants"" rocketed to Billboard's pole position, as the pop-soul hip-hop beats of Aguilera's music are a true amalgam of Tuesday's hottest trends. But as brass is made of copper and only looks like gold, Aguilera and her album lack depth and swim in superficiality. Aguilera's voice is at very least acceptable; rival teen queen Britney Spears offers an embarrassingly pathetic lack of range and tonal character. If you're deciding between them, pick this, the lesser of two evils."
5,Grow up people!,"To all those who gave this a poor review...what were you listening to? This is a GREAT cd. I think it's such a waste of time comparing her to others. Christina Aguilera is truly gifted and should be appreciated for who she is, and not condemned for who she isn't. Grow up people! If you don't have this cd, buy it."
3,"If you think this cd will sound like genie, u r wrong","The first major difference between christina aguillera and brittney spears is that christina can actually sing. If you are looking for a teenie bopper cd like brittney with songs like genie in a bottle, then you are buying the wrong cd. I love the slow songs like I turn to you and Obvious but I felt her vocal talent outweys the pop sensation. This cd sounds more like a mariah carey cd then a brittney spears so beware."
3,4 1/2 stars for what,"Honestly, the record company could have kept this album to themselves. It was a rushed album for a talent who's voice isn't worth the rush. Besides the album singles and maybe two b sides, it isn't worth the recognition. Just some raggidy tracks for someone who was worth way more than the effort that the record company gave her."
4,a very talented artist indeed,"i think christina aguilera has a stunning voice that shines and glows. it's in comparable. great debut album. her first single was a good opening song for her career. her 4 singles on this album are:1.)genie in a bottle2.)what a girl wants3.)come on over (all i want is you)4.)i turn to youand that's the order that she released them in. i definitley reccomend this album to people who like jessica simpson, mariah carey, and similar artists as that."
4,Nice debute,"Christina Aguilera comes in the summer of 1999 to say she has arrived in style. Well it's a nice first cd but I still think she has more to prove to us than she just another Blond. 3 out of 4 of her singles I like and they were Gennie, What a girl wants, and come on over. I really didn't care for I turn to you and I still don't the video was like boring come on Chris! Overall it was a great performance for a great artist."
3,Passable Teen Pop,"I love punk and rock music, and my favorite CDs include music by Radiohead, Tori Amos, Pink Floyd, The Who, Nirvana, and The Clash. So obviously I'm not a teenybopper...but somehow, I think Christina Aguilera is more talented than Britney. It doesn't mean much since Britney doesn't have a whole lot of talent, but hell, Christina can sing! And some of the tunes on this CD have me dancing along with her. It is formulated cookie-cutter pop music, but it's enjoyable anyway. Christina definitely beats Britney all to hell."
4,i think that this cd is good,this cd is really good and i like it. my favorite song is Genie in a Bottle. i hope that i will see her release another album.
3,"Great voice, bad songs","I am a big fan of Britney Spears, yet I have to admit that Chritina Aguilera has a slight advantage over Britney in the vocals department. However, the songs she sings just aren't up to the lyrical quality that runs rampant through her 17 year old counter part's CD. There are only a small handful of good songs on this album, including: Genie in a Bottle and Reflection. Blessed, Love Will Find a Way, and Obvious are also decent songs. The rest are not worth listening to. She needs more songs that would better show off her musical abilities."
3,Gotta admit-the girl's got talent,"Overall, it's a good CD. But the only really good song is ""Genie in a Bottle"" and eventually, you hear it so much (on radio and CD) you get sick of it. And basically, the other songs are just pretty good. I would suggest borrowing it from a friend first."
4,Good CD,"This CD is a very good buy. Christina Aguilera has a wonderful voice that Britney Spears can not compete with. Christina has definite talent, and she could be in the music industry for years to come. However the only way she will be able to stay in the music business is to showcase her obvious singing talents more then she did on her current CD. Although this is a very good CD, hopefully her next one will showcase her talent as a singer."
2,Potential...,"There's no arguing that Aguilera has talent. She's definitely got a mature, powerful voice that, when coupled with good music and lyrics, could really go somewhere. For her vocal capability, I give her two stars.Unfortunately, for the most part, the songs themselves honestly aren't very good. The lyrics don't leave much to the imagination(""Hormones raging at the speed of light...?"" Where's the poetry in that?). I think if Aguilera collaborated with some different songwriters, she could produce an much better album."
2,Christina can sing but what else?,"Yes, Christina can sing, but she aint no songwriter, no producer or anything else more credible than the fluff on her debut album. The songs are generic, formulaic and in short, boring! With better material and a cooler image, she will do right and very right indeed. Otherwise, she just tries too hard at being Whitney/Mariah/Celine."
5,BEST!,Hey everyone! I just wanted to tell you that you MUST buy this CD! Christina Aguilera is the best singer in the WORLD and she and I both know that what a girl wants is her cd!
4,You pay for half of the cd,"Of course this cd includes ""Genie In A Bottle"" which is a fan favorite. It also has ""What a Girl Wants"" and a few other songs that go along with the hip hop beat. The other songs on this cd are slow and very boring like ""Blessed"" and ""I Turn to You."" She sings about things that are out of her age range. I would get this cd if you have listened to it before and like most of the songs, but if you just like one of her songs, this cd isn't for you and if you only like hip hop songs then i would recommend not buying this cd and just getting the single of the song you like."
2,"The songs are OK, but they just aren't fun :-(","After listening to the album, there was just something missing. Sure, there are a few decent songs (Genie, What a Girl Wnats, Come on Over) but most of these songs are much worse then their commercial releases on MTV and the radio. But the rest of the album is just too showy and -well- boring! She spends too much time wabling around her voice that it gets really irritating. If you are in the market for an all-around rockin' fun album, you should consider Britney's. She invests her voice into dancable, even rock-ish songs while Christina tries too hard to show off her voice. Christina does have a more powerful voice than Britney, but if my only criteria in an album was a powerful voice I'd go buy someone much better like Charlotte Church. Just cause Christina has a decent voice doesn't make this album good, and I was very disappointed. I am going to stick with Britney."
2,i really thought the was going to be a good CD,"i wished this album would've been better.my only fav songs are :What a girl wants, i turn you, come on over baby, reflection.The other songs are boring or too slow.i can say this is the worst CD i've ever brought! i wished it was better"
4,A shrewd move,"Y'know, there's plenty of reviews, so you don't need another from me. I just wanna say that the CD is great, but I don't see why they felt like they had to remix every single that came after Genie In A Bottle. What A Girl Wants was redone, so you had to buy the single even after you bought the album, which was OK with me cuz the radio remix was better than the original. But, NOW they slighty reworked I Turn To You and they release a new version of Come On Over, now called Come On Over Baby. It seems like the record company thinks that selling seven million albums wasn't good enough, so they figure they'll remix every single and make some more bucks by cranking out a couple million single discs. What a shrewd move. No wonder NSYNC left RCA for Jive."
4,This White girl can SING!,"I am a 25-year-old african-amercian who loves this CD. It is not a teen bopper CD. It is a CD that is rich in vocals and in presence. What her voice does on this CD does not even compare to her singing live. Brittany- can have those back flips she does so well. That will fade and she (Brittany) will have that horrible voice to rely on. Christina will still have that soulful voice that will mature with age and experience. I agree that she needs a fashion coach. Hopefully, maturity should change that. Then I could be wrong look at Mariah."
5,AWESOME! Ü,"This cd is awesome. I like tracks 1-10. The rest is just OK. but 1-10 RULZ. I really like ""somebody's somebody"" right now. I suggest this cd to anyone. IT IS GREAT!"
4,Christina Aguilera,I have very much enjoyed this CD. Christina has a beautiful voice. She deserves the Grammy for Best New Artist!
4,Excellent debut pop album,"This is a brilliant album that greatly exceeded my expectations. It definitely makes a refreshing change from the albums of the many young manufactured singers of today which consist of a few catchy singles and then effortless fillers. It is clear that effort has gone into each song. Although Christina did not write these songs herself, she carries them off well with her amazing vocals and the songs are not corny, they are about topics which a lot of people, male and female, young and old can relate to. If you think that Genie in a Bottle is going to be the only good song on the album, buy it and prove yourself wrong!"
3,A mediocre release for a wonderful artist,"Let's be honest, christina definetely has the voice, but this cd just puts her in the ""teeny-bopper"" category. This album is filled with a lot of forgetable filler. Some of the standouts are ""Come on over"" and ""reflection"", only for the fact that they are showcases of christinas amazing voice. Let's hope christinas sophmore albumis filled with more vocal showcases then her debut."
5,*~ This girl CAN sing*~,"This girl can sing! I don't care what anyone says! i think she's great~ Her musical talents anyways~ I can't wait for her new CD to come out~ I hope she continues with her hip songs and beautiful ballads~With upbeat songs like Genie In a Bottle, What A Girl Wants, and Come on Over (All I want is You) thats what makes this girl fit into the pop princess category. But it doenst just end there! there's more to her than that!With songs like, I Turn to You, Reflection, and Blessed that's where the amazing vocals come in~ She CAN sing! She has vocal abilities~ You hear her voice and you're like that little tiny girl can sing unbelieveably~Other songs like So Emotional, Love For All Seasons,and Somebody's Somebody, are also great songs that stand out~If you like pop but also appreciate unbelievable vocals and songs that will stick with you, then I suggest you try Ms. Aguilera's album~"
4,hmmm interesting,not being a great christina fan i bought this cd in an any 2 for 22 from HMV. It took me a while to get into and i didn't listen to it all the way through for months however when i did i was surprised it was quite a refreshing change the songs sounded different unlike some cds i have listened to (why does britney spears spring to mind!!??) i have to confess its not perfect and there are some tracks such as so emotional which i skip past but i absolutely love obvious and blessed. I do think you have to be a lover of ballads and poppy music to like this album but if you dont like it at first bear with it-as we say in these parts its a grower and soon you'll find you'll actually like it a scary but pleasing moment! my verdict is four stars although she can sing i don't quite think she will live up to mariah and whitney expectations.
2,The Genie came Out of the Bottle...Then wen't back in...,"HI I just want to say I do like a few songs:(1)""Genie in a Bottle""(2)""What a Girl Wants""(3)""Reflection""(4)""When you put your Hands On Me""(5)""Come On Over""Thats it the rest of the cd is awful it's too slow and ballad Mariah Carey like... Over all this cd is not that great Don't purchase this cd if you want somthing a little more upbeat and not a contest to see how long she can hold singing one note. I do like ballads at times but not when it's just a person seeing how long they can hold a note I think it causes poor melody structure. So with that being said, my rating is 2 stars."
4,Pretty good,"A good cd. My favorite songs were ""Genie in a Bottle"" ""What a girl Wants"" ""I turn to you"" and ""come on over"" the rest of the cd was okay, but not tht great. So my advice is, buy it used"
3,"Good, but not my style!","Christina has a wonderful voice... it is just so beautiful, you could compare it to Celine Dion or Mariah Carey's voices. When I heard ""Genie In A Bottle"" on the radio, I asked for the CD for Christmas. I got it, but I have only listened to the CD all the way through once. I was disappointed to find out ""What A Girl Wants"" was the album version, it wasn't the cool remix that they play on the radio. And she has lots of slow songs that just don't appeal to me. I will admit that ""Come On Over"" and ""So Emotional"" are really good songs, but the music just isn't my style. I'd recommend it if you like Jessica Simpson's ""Sweet Kisses"" or Mariah Carey's ""Rainbow"""
2,Yeah She Can Sing....but?,"What is with all these singers today? They don't do anything on their CD's other than sing! They don't write, produce or compose. Nothing! What happened to the true artist? Christina can sing, yes, very beautifully. And who knows, maybe she can write too, but she hasn't proved it yet! Anyhow, I do enjoy some songs on this CD, like 'Genie In A Bottle' 'cause its a good dance song and a couple others, but not much more. Two Out Of Five."
4,Very good!,"Songs on here are really, really good! My favorite songs are ""Blessed"", ""Reflection"", ""What a Girl Wants"", ""Genie in a Bottle"", ""I Turn to You"", and ""So Emotional"". She has a spectacular voice that will really make you want to listen...So Emotional is an R&B style song, when I Turn to You, Reflection, and Blessed, and kind of soft, relaxing songs, and Genie in a Bottle and What a Girl Wants are pure dance...This CD could use a little bit of work, but still...She shows a lot of potential, and what's good on this CD is REALLY GOOD!"
2,"Liked author's emotions but didn't like ""quotes"" from dead son.","I liked the first part of the book where the author shares her grief and loss of son. I did not enjoy the quotes through the book that she thinks her deceased son would say. I also did not like her visits to ""mediums"" in the last half of the book. There are too many people ready to take money from grieving parents. I bought many books on grief but did not like much of this particular one."
5,A Great Healing Tool,"This book brought me great comfort. I especially liked the final page of each chapter. Sandy creates a great sense of spiritual awareness. I couln't put this book down, it was for sure a must read. With Sandy's view on things this is one of ways to cope and continue to live on with the people here, on the physcial side, but know that our loved ones continue to be with us spiritually. I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!"
5,Heartfelt book by a highly credible author,"Sandy Goodman's account of her experiences after her son's death is earnest, honest, compelling, courageous, informative, and beautifully written. A refreshing aspect of her book is that she is not trying to persuade anyone to believe anything, but rather is providing a factual recitation of extraordinary events as she experienced them, inviting the reader to simply consider some possible alternatives to our society's prevailing views of death, grief, and the afterlife. A book that arises from, and is filled with, love."
5,"Spirit Lead, Spriit Filled","Thank you Sandy and Jason for your wise words. There are no coincidences--this book has helped me on my spiritual journey to connect with my precious nephew even more. The poetry made me cry, but was also healing. Jason, catch the bubbles and smile as they are sent your way!"
5,An Enlightening Jewel,"Sandy Goodman brings astounding clarity and answers to questions that many people ask when a dear loved one ""dies.""Through this jewel of a book, you will certainly come out with a lot more understanding and relief than you had before you read it.As a mother and spiritual, self-help author, I know that the spiritual integrity of this book is impeccable. Love Never Dies brings light, hope, and even joy to anyone who feels the deep pain of loss. Your pain will be lifted. You will receive answers, and your heart will be put at ease after you read ""Love Never Dies."" Highly recommended as a Must Read!From my heart, Barbara Rose, author of ""Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE"" and 'If God Was Like Man'Editor of inspire! magazine"
5,Love Never Dies,"How very simple to state that my reading this book has changed my life. That when I put the book down after the last page was finished my life started on a journey I never could have guessed. An seemingly endless road of joyfull discovery both within myself and connections of love that had always been there.Reading Sandy Goodman's book, saved my life, fed my soul and let me love and know my son with a sweetness that is so close too the light, it blinds me!Thank you"
5,Life-saving,"I read Love Never Dies a month after my son died. I couldn't concentrate on much at that time, but I devoured this book. Because it was written by a mom who had experienced the feelings I had, it was like being thrown a life preserver in a violent storm. Thank you Sandy and Jason."
5,this book helped save my sanity and my emotional well being,I read this book a few months after my 21 year old daughter was killed in a car accident. It opened up so many avenues for me (including contact with the medium Ocallah (mentioned in the book)and truly assisted in my grieving process and gave me the coping tools necessary to survive this loss. I am a grief counselor myself (how ironic this is) and i have purchased several copies of the book to hand out to my clients who have suffered similar losses to mine. I totally recommend this book to anyone who has ever suffered a tragic loss of a loved one.
1,DO NOT ASSIGN THIS BOOK,"In my years in undergrad, law school, and grad school, I have never encountered such a disorganized mess of a book. The fact that I actually had to pay hundres of dollars for this atrocity makes me sick. The chapters are not outlined in a manner that enables the reader to understand how the topics and positions related. The information conveyed is boring, and the author expends far too many words attemtpting to explain his points. HATE THIS BOOK, and the price I paid for it. If this class wasn't a requirement, I would've dropped it solely on the basis of this course text."
4,Easy Reading for the Average Joe,"This book is organized well, and is an easy read. You don't need a PhD in economics to understand or comprehend the material. Mikesell gets his point across without trying to dazzle the reader with his detailed knowledge and experience of economic concepts. He's a decent instructor too."
4,"Easy install, perfect fit","Have had these step bars for 6 months and am happy with the install and appearance. A note of caution, step only on the foot pads because the chrome is easily scratched. Happened on my passenger side - hmmm, guess I could cover it with a ""No Step"" sticker! They look great and I get lots of good comments on my Silverado HD Diesel. NO interference with the DEF tank on the right side, as is the case with many other bars. I called Westin technical and they assured me of this before I bought, very helpful telephone support. I installed myself in a little over an hour working from a creeper, but if you are putting them on a lower clearance vehicle you might need to raise the truck a bit."
5,Westin Step Bars on 2007 Silverado,Installation was flawless. Took about 45 minutes. One person job with no holes to drill but a torque wrench is needed to reseat existing bolts
5,this is the best game ever,If you like virtualpet games you will love this game. YOu can pick any pets you want from any litter online or not if they get hungry just feed always play with them and give them attention or they will get lonely.
2,Slots are too loose,"The CD pockets are too loose and they fall out if you tip the case. The slots didn't have to stretch out from use, from the moment I put the CDs in for the first time, they were too big. I tipped the case slightly and they slid right out. Won't survive sharp turns on the road. Otherwise, a good, reasonably priced case (I bought directly from Amazon for $5.98). I can also see how the bottom row might be hard to access while driving."
3,It ok,Like: It fits fine on my sunvisorDislike: when I turn corners the DVDs flies to the floorI would recommed
