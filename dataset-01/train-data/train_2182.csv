4,MANNIE FRESH IZ A BEAST AT BOUNCE,"If you like old Cash Money/Bounce music,i suggest u pick this one up...but it iz only 6 songs!!My favorite is the song ""Charlie Whop!!"".Mannie Fresh mixes the New Orleans flavored Triggerman & brown beat and puts it behind Al B. Sure's classic ""Night & Day"" beat...And the Monkey ON Tha Dick song is the original Back That Azz UP....Notice they sound just alike...Also,this song ""Magnolia Shorty"" has Juvenile's first appearance on Cash Money Records!!Peep it ouT!!!"
4,The Woodlanders,"Larry Thomas's poems have the smack of the piney woods, all their rot, dankness, and entropic decay. His is a secret voice -- dark and disarming -- that intones the rhythms of the Southeast Texas woodlands where earth, air, and water blend. Like the carapace of a cicada, his poetry produces melodies taht are natural but startlingly original. His a voice that freshens language as well as place."
3,RMA time,"Ordered 3, had to send one back, it was defective. They replaced it but didn't give much time to send the defective one back."
5,Greg Plitt is a great teacher! Follow his guidance and you can't miss.,"Greg Plitt not only demonstrates a multitude of various exercises,he explains which head of which muscle is worked by varying different grips,which exercises should be done first(and why)and which should be done last.Greg Plitt is a born teacher,he shows the proper form as well as improper form.I have given two of these as presents to people who are trainers and they are as enthusiastic as I am."
3,Just O.K.,"I bought this because I saw this guy on a reality show and I thought I'd see what he could teach me. I did learn a few new things, but mostly, one needs to have access to a gym in order to perform most of the exercises in this video. Not a bad video, but I've seen better."
5,Ga-Ga Gorgeous Greg Delivers,"Awesome DVD! You learn about the man himself and then get into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the DVD-- his workout. VERY informative. Highly recommended! As smart as he is handsome. Hopefully, Greg will do another one showing us his workout for legs and glutes. PLEASE GREG!"
1,Worst store ever!,"Maybe it could be a good DVD that maybe could help wiht different techniques.... but the seller sent me a broken DVD Box and the DVD disc is competely Scratched .... I've seen something like this.... for me.... worst transaction ever. Seriously I lost my money with this... I really hope to have a refund.... because I lost my money and that DVD is useless. Amazon I'm still waiting for some answers.And by the way, the DVD Box is very crappy, It looks like someone printed the cover at home then pasted with some school glue, and sent the DVD."
2,Not one I'd read again,The subject is sad but interesting. Mothers hurting their own children for attention. I think that is why some people have a hard time believing Tara Reid could be guilty because it is such an odd disorder. That doesn't mean she didn't do it. I also found how taken the author was with Prosecuter Hanes quite comical to the extent of putting a pic of her in her ballerina outfit in the photo's section. I gave this book a low star rating due to the fact I tried to reread it again today and could not do it. It was okay the first time but it is not one of my faves for sure!
2,No flow to the book!,"I've read many, many true crime books. I was disappointed with Cruel Deception by Gregg Olsen. The flow of the book was terrible; he jumps through time back and forth, back and forth. He focuses more on the prosecutor than the family. He introduces so many doctors, from so many states from so many time periods it was greatly confusing. I got the feeling that several of the chapters were already discussed in other parts of the book and I was rereading the book again.The story itself was intriguing, but again the author focused too much on the prosecutor than on the people who were involved with Tanya and her family. I can barely stand to finish the book. It has been putting me to sleep on the train while I read heading to work."
4,I know the inside story and she is as guilty as sin.,"I have just ordered the book. I was on the grand jury that indicted Tanya. The evidence against her was so incredibly overwhelming that the grand jury voted unanimously to indict her. In fact, because we bothlived in the small town where the little girl was murdered, I met both Tanya and her dim-bulb of a husband. I want this book more as a memento than anything else. For anyone who may have doubts, you may put them to rest. Tanya was guilty not just beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond all doubt. I read the medical reports at length and the interviews. She should remain in prison forever."
3,cruel deception,this is just what this item is. this is another old book re-released under a different title. this is an unfair practice. when you order and receive something you already own it is very disappointing. they should let you know it has been re-titled
4,"Good read, but I wanted more!","Overall, this was a very good book about a subject that I find depressing to read about (munchausen syndrome by proxy). Their was not enought information given about the background of the main character Tanya Reid, in my opinion, and too much detail was given to describing the lead prosecuting attorney's background (which I did not care about). However it is still a very interesting story, and a tragic one."
3,"Comfy Slipper, but cording falls off...","The cording around the top of the slipper started peeling off after about 3 weeks of wearing them. Disappointed in the quality of the slipper. Doesn't seem like it is real leather on the sides or on the cording. I would suggest a slipper without any cording, they are very comfy but the cording peeling off looks terrible!"
5,Evans Mens Slippers,I have worn these slippers before and was so happy to find out you were stocking them. They don't need to be broken in and last for a very long time.
5,Super Slippers,"I have had these slippers for 2 years and really love them. They are very comfortable and hold up well to heavy use. I wear them every day, usually after work and I wear them not only around the house but outside too, usually to fetch the mail or around the back yard. I just can't find a better made or more comfortable slipper than these. I am getting my 2nd pair this Christmas! Can't wait."
1,Keep looking.....,"These are not what they use to be. Bought the same pair in 2009 and they were great until I spilled a can of paint on them...opps!No problem I'll just order another pair, I had the new pair for three days and they started to fall apart.All the welting is coming apart.I use to wear the old ones all the time inside and out. Still looked new. These forget it, sending back not worth the $$$""NOT the same QUAILITY"" as they were before. Fair price.....$5.00!"
3,blade,"I ordered a size 13 the size I normally wear. Had to send back toobig. Then I ordered a size 12, same slipper. These were too small. I learned my lesson and that is go to the mall."
5,One of my favorite books,"Stanton Friedman: One of the very few scientists ufologists who make sense.He researches the topic.He provides uncontested data.He defied the arrogant scientists.He studied the phenomena as an honest scientist.He spent 30 years investigation Ufos.He knows!He knows!His books are the very core of Ufology.He is the ONE!S. Mahdi, Cairo, Egypt."
3,I have the bundt pan of this set.,"I only gave this pan 3 stars because second time I used it it burntto the pan and you really had to scrap it good to get it clean. However, I love the feature that you can get a cake out of the pan so EASY and in ONE PIECE.Worth the cost for sure."
1,would never buy anymore of this,I just baked a loaf of banana bread in my loaf baker and the entire bottom stuck to the pan when I turned it over.I am throwing it out and will never buy another piece of it!
1,You're Not Crazy It's Your Hormones: The Hormone Diva's Workbook,"Worthless! Doesn't tell you anything you don't already know. If you want the full information and an easy reading book, read "" Feeling Fat, Fuzzy and Frazzled"" by Dr. Richard Shames, and Karilee Shames."
1,This didn't last,I think the number 8 popped out within a few days. Very dangerous for any dog. My dog tore it to shreds before I took it away from him.
1,"IF YOU ENJOY WAITING 2 WEEKS, FOR THE BATTERIES TO POWER YOUR YOUR NEW RADIO, DO USE THIS COMPANY","THIS WAS TO BE PART OF A GIFT(TO ACCOMPANY A NEW RADIO)WELL , THE RADIO ARRIVED 7 DAYS AGO AM STILL WAITING FOR THE BATTERIES( 14 DAYS LATER).HAD TO BUY BATTERIES LOCALLY, TO GIVE MY GIFT ON TIME.DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,great price,"price is right, arrives quickly, quality seems fine. i've been using them for cordless christmas decorations, and they last as long as other batteries."
5,My favorite Season 5 episode!,"Picard gets stranded on an alien world with an alien captain he can't communicate with. As Picard and the alien captain struggle to communicate with each other, they also find themselves being hunted by an invisible savage creature. If that wasn't bad enough, the Enterprise crew are unable to get to the captain, and they're on the verge of going to war with the alien captain's vessel. Even if Picard manages to survive the creature, can he learn to communicate with the aliens and get back to the ship before an interstellar war breaks out?It's not only action-packed with some good acting, good effects, and a great story, but it also has heart. Apart from the action, there are some great character moments between Picard and the alien captain that makes this one truly a great episode. It's everything Star Trek should be, and everything Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry wanted it to be. Highly recommended!"
5,A testament to the excellence of season 5...,"""Darmok"" captures what is the heart and soul of Star Trek: discovering new races and learning to coexist with them. In this episode, that is no easy feat for Picard, who is trapped on a planet with an alien captain who talks different from everyone else. The two cannot understand each other, but as a monster hunts them down, it becomes apparent that the two must learn how to communicate. This is a phenominal episode, downplaying the action and instead building on the characters of the alien captain and Picard. It's not just good Star Trek, it's great science-fiction. While the monster effects are very subpar (they always are for Star Trek), the being itself is of little importance to the story. What is important is how Picard and the other captain learn how to communicate. Truly a wonderful episode."
2,Chilly Atlantis very improbable,"The Flem-Aths have done considerable research but their conclusionthat Antarctica was the site of Atlantis will prove wildly wrong. Theyhave relied too heavily on Charles Hapgood's maps and theories such asthe Piri Reis map which reveals and ice-free coastline on Antarcticaand on the doubtful theory of crust displacement. Even if Hapgood'simprobable belief that Antarctica lay 2,000 miles closer to theequator 11,5000 years ago could be proven, Antarctica still could nothave supported a climate such as that found in Plato's description ofAtlantis -- only the central regions of the Americas could haveprovided such riches in a then very cold world. Further, there is noevidence of a superior civilization in Antarctica, but at the centerof the Americas, a land that creatively connects the great oceancurrents, there lie the most enigmatic relics of a great civilization-- the almost perfectly spherical stone spheres of Costa Rica."
3,A good book.,I did learn a few things that I didn't know about Atlantis and I believe they are probably wrong with the location of Atlantis but this book was very interesting and kept me reading.
4,Seems pretty good but...,"I am completely shallow in some things, I understand this. I have no problem with the actual content of the book, it is a pretty good read. However, I was disappointed when I received the book because it looks so...insignificant. I don't know if it is because it is paperback, or so small, but it just doesn't look like the quality of book I like. The paper is bad, the pages are a bit yellow, and the cover is totally boring. The book itself, I would recommend, but for crazy people like me who like to have pretty books too, I would recommend looking for a different version, because this one is unimpressive...just because of that, don't overlook its quality in content, but still."
4,It asks some very interesting questions...,"While I may not be too sure of an advanced civilization known as Atlantis the book does ask some things that interest me, such as: Where did the maps that that show PRE-Ice Age Earth come from? How did big mammals end up freezing to death WHEN such animals would have NEVER even been in such an environment? (And, frankly, how do you flash-freeze such large animals?)While you might not like the answers, I like the fact that they don't ONCE talk about aliens. I'm sick of aliens. Ancient man was as smart IF not smarter than current man. They did a lot if not more than modern man and without computers, atomic power and pet rocks."
1,Cut and Paste Garbage,"Mr Rosner has succeeded in ""compiling"" a worthless piece of fiction. There is little original thinking from the author. It strikes this reader as exceedingly negative. He makes no attempt to connnect the worker with his or her own career. Instead, the book is about surviving in a war zone that is completely foreign to the worker-soldier. I am of the belief that each of us is capable of finding a work environment that is positive for our skills and talents. Mr Rosner apparently believes that we are forced into negative work places without choice. It will not be recommended to my career transition clients."
4,Working Wounded. As If Dilbert Came To Life...,"I bought the ""Working Wounded"" as a gift for the members of a team I once worked on. I felt that many of the situations that Bob Rosner brought to light measured up with how we dealt with our day. It went over quite well, and was entertaining as well as enlightening. I look forward to a second volume."
1,Marriages only,"The description of the book states that it contains the ""records"" but upon purchasing it, I discovered that it only lists marriages -- it does not list baptisms. I would not have bought the book if I had known that ahead of time."
5,Better than other antibiotic ointments -,"This is great stuff. I use it on all my cuts and scrapes, as well as burns. Not only prevents infection, but speeds up the healing process - much better than regular OTC antibiotic ointments. Just wish it came in a larger size!"
3,Just Snipits,I was disappointed in the snipit version of this video. It recaps past episodes that involved the characters inolved with Peter but doesn't really capture the essence of any of the episodes. I guess I would have preferred to see a few episodes in their original form.
1,Disappointed,"I loved the first two Bruno books - the lovely countryside, the descriptions of each meal and the wine. The mysteries were interesting the the pace of the book a leisurely stroll. This is 3 different books sandwiched together and maybe I could have cared about the cave people if I had been able to keep interest long enough to finish the first cave chapter, but why slog through a boring read in the hopes that at some point I will care about the characters. I looked forward to the next chapter in the hope that it was short and I could return to the characters in the present day who I liked. But wait, now I have to read another long chapter from WWII. Never mind, I gave up. This was supposed to be a pleasant read but I'm giving up and going to another book."
5,Magic - a compelling read,"I can't think when I last read a book that enthralled me at som many different levels. It's about art and war and life, and there's a subtle message runing thru that says it's the art that makes us human. The plot might seem complex; we weave from 17,000 years BC in the culture that produced the Lascaux cave paintings, and then go to the same part of France during World War Two in the time of the Resistance, and then come home to today, where a hunt for an undiscovered cave takes us back to the same valley. Because Walker creates real characters who make us care about them in each of these three time lines, it's like getting three books in one. And there is this sense of continuity, as if characters from one time find their echo in another. I sat up till 4am to finish it, and loved it. What a brilliant movie this would make. I can almost see Tom Cruise in the leading role, from Stone Age artist to Resistance fighter to modern French politician."
3,Not as good as Bruno,"Placing the story in multiple times is difficult to carry off, and I don't think it works well here, especially the pre-history segments. The pre-history characters are hard to accept. I bought the book because I enjoy his Bruno, chief of police stories. Those work much better."
3,Recent history in cavemen's caves,Disappointed: it is not a Bruno's mystery. Interesting but quite different a genre. Prefer Bruno and these great mysteries that take place in beautiful - and mysterious - Perigord.
5,"One taste, you will give up albacore tuna for life.","Yes, this is true . I treat myself and my loved ones with quality food at affordable prices. This tuna I had as a boy growing up and today it tastes even better. Don,t forget this tuna is not albacore, it is yellowfin. This is a better tasting more expensive tuna, with olive oil. You will agree , with a touch of red onions , a little mayo, and maybe Italian bread or a toasted bagel, or even freshly toasted rye bread with the seeds. Oboy you think you died and went to Heaven. Trust me, Retired Early"
2,It's Dark meat,"The tuna has a nice taste, but it is not light meat, as the label says. It is cat-food brown. Want white tuna? Try Bumble Bee Prime Fillet Solid White Albacore."
5,Progresso Tuna,This is the only tuna my family will eat. Unfortunately it is not available in the stores in the small town we live in. So I order it online.
5,Incredible!,"This thing just saved my back, my boobs and my sanity! After 2 month of struggling with Boppies, I am grateful."
2,Not very confortable,"This pillow is not very confortable specially if you have C-section. It is very difficult to use when you have a baby in your arms and you try to seat and acomodate the pillow....the pillow arm was a nightmare for me! I ended buying the boppy, and I am glad I did! The cover is nice and poket too..."
1,not for us,I really dont like this pillow at all. Its to hard (not firm but hard) Its not comfortable to wear & I cant use this pillow for the football hold since the way the curve of the pillow is made. Im upset I wasted so much money on this pillow
5,"10X Better than Boppy, easy to clean, use it standing up!","The removable cover (zipper) makes this easy to clean (just make sure the velcro is stuck to itself when you wash it or it will stick to all your nice socks.)My wife tried a boppy for the first month then got this, which she used continually for the next year. She has used it for all 3 of our children. The Boppy my sister loaned us was pretty flat after she used it for only one child.You can even use it standing up or when you move around since the strap goes around your back. The strap also provides back & lumbar support. The pocket is a nice touch (you put your Lansinoh, cell phone, baby nail clippers, etc in it) The only possible downside is it isn't that easy to put on with one hand (for example, if you are already cradling the baby)If you're price sensitive look around, there are often significant discounts for older colors.If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"
2,"uh, not for me","I used a boppy pillow with my first six yrs. ago. I couldn't find the old boppy so I decided to try the new nursing pillow.It IS very supportive, it makes a shelf on your abdomen for your baby to lay on.But...-You can't safely hold baby while putting it on.-It's quite large and an odd shape, which makes it difficult to store.-It's pretty stiff and at times I feel like my baby is unsafe on the pillow (It feels like he's going to roll off).The Boppy...-Was more compact to store.-I could swing it on and off without putting down my baby.-It was multipurpose! I used it for nursing, tummy time, and for sitting baby in a reclined position, we had lots of fun with that boppy.I have to find my Boppy!"
3,Nice concept.. but didnt work for me.,"This pillow is a wonderful concept.. but it just did not work for me. I have several cons..My daughter had latching problems and for the first 6 weeks would only latch in the ""football"" position. So, it made this pillow impossible to use for the first six weeks. After that, she latched on normally and I again tried to use this pillow, but found that it put baby up to high for me. Maybe it was because I was used to just a traditional pillow, but I did not like this pillow.I nursed my daughter for 17 months.. and in my opinion.. save your money - a regular pillow works just as well if not better. Like I mentioned, wonderful concept, but I was one of the women who these pillows did not work for.. so something to consider before purchasing this pillow!"
4,A luxury item,"In general I'm glad that I own this product, but I am sure that I would be fine without it; it's a luxury item.I bought the Brest Friend for breastfeeding my first baby. After trying it out on the first day home from the hospital, I thought I'd surely not use it because it was very awkward to use it while sitting in my glider and very difficult to use with any other hold but the cradling hold; the ""football"" hold was the easiest for me when I first trying to breastfeed and this hold was so clumsy using the Brest Friend that I just used my own bed pillows.After 3 weeks of breastfeeding, though, I gave the Brest Friend another try and it turned out to be very convenient! I could now type at a keyboard, use a mouse, operate a remote control, even eat a sandwich while breastfeeding with the Brest Friend! It is, however, still awkward to get clipped on when holding a hungry, fussy baby :-/If you have the $ for such a luxury item, it's nice to have around, but pillows work nearly as well ;-)"
1,Caused Dent in Baby's Head,The cushion has two raised bumps. One of these bumps caused a dent in the baby's head after prolonged use. We had to cut through the foam to remove reduce the bump so that we could avoid a cranio-facial specialist. I would have given it 4 stars if it didn't have these stupid bumps. It would also be better if it were longer.
5,Better than Boppy for breastfeeding,"This is a definite must have for all breastfeeding moms! I have both the Brestfriend as well as the Boppy and although the Boppy has its uses, I have to say that the for breastfeeding, Brestfriend is much better at keeping baby at the right level and from slipping down. I love that it's almost hands free. It doesn't slide down and keeps baby at the right level. However, since baby is getting big now, I do have to lay a small pillow underneath, between the Brestfriend and my lap just for a little more support. The latch is sturdy and doesn't wake baby when opening. It also has little nubs for headrests. I got the one with the soft minky type fabric and baby Hunter loves it. Falls asleep on it all the time. This is worth every penny!"
2,Dent on your baby's head,I got one as a gift. It's bit annoying to buckle it every time and also it was difficult to level it. I often times had to put extra pillow underneath it.After a month of using it I noticed that there's a dent on my baby's head. If a baby nurses for more than 20 min per feeding 8-12 times a day that's a significant amount of time your baby is spending on that hard bumpy raised head rest. My friend's baby also has a dent on her head. I started to use the bottom part instead. Also the thickness of the back belt doesn't allow me to lean comfortably on the couch. What I am upset about is the bumps and how it dented my baby's head.
5,must-have for breast feeding,"I tried to use Boppy pillow at first, but found it is a lot easier to breastfeed my baby using this product. I can adjust heights using the strap and flat surface provides a comfy place for the baby. My son actually falls a sleep on it. I also like the pocket where I can keep burp clothes. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to my friends."
1,Toxic!! Please do not buy.,"How are they getting away with selling a BABY product with such a toxic, gaseous smell??! This pillow reeks with fumes, I think from both the plastic packaging and the foam in the pillow itself. Please do not buy this pillow for use near your baby."
4,Good and not so good,The good part of this product is that it is exactly as described and easy to clean. It helped my wife alot. The bad is that you have to strap it on (takes a little getting used to) and then sit in a chair that will accomodate it and nothing with handles that are meant for a normal person.The bad is just a personal preference item which resulted in it not being used much.
4,Best for a newborn,"I loved this pillow for when baby was a newborn and I really needed him up higher. This pillow is foam so it is soft but not squishy, and baby doesn't sink into it. Now that he's bigger I've switched to a smaller pillow but for those early newborn weeks a good supportive pillow is essential for me when breastfeeding is hard."
4,I love this pillow!,"The bobby is cute and soft, but did not provide the support needed for nursing my infant daughter. I tried it out at my lactation consultant's office and it was so much better! I don't like that my pillow, which I was given from a friend, is foam without a cover. The only downside to this pillow is that putting the cover back on is a bit cumbersome. However, it is much better than the Bobby. One idea I got from the lactation consultant is to put a blanket on top of the cover when nursing or burping baby, that way if baby burps up milk or has a diaper blowout, you can just throw the blanket in the hamper and get another clean one. It is also helpful to buy a spare cover so one is always clean."
4,Great for breastfeeding beginners!,"We got this at our baby shower and I kept on using it until a few days ago - our baby just turned 4 weeks :-).It really helps in latching the baby on and seems comfortable for him. Also, especially if it is a ""big boy"", like ours, having him on it makes it easier to hold him. BUT: while it is not rocket science to put it on, it takes some ""experience"" to do it one handed, with the baby in the other...I sure would recommend it at least until the new mom figures out how to nurse the ""relaxed"" way, with the baby in your lap."
5,"Back, shoulder and wrist saver!!","This is the top of my list for must-haves for nursing Moms. I started out with only the Boppy (which I got as a hand-me-down) and it just doesn't compare. I couldn't imagine breast feeding all day, everyday without this. The only negative I can think of is the name of the product although it does live up to its billing."
5,Awesome,"Breastfeeding is hard enough without the hassle of trying to figure out how to get your baby situated. The Boppy worked great for rocking chairs with arm support but in bed or on couch, made my posture horrible and made baby fall into me while nursing. my BreastFriend changed that. The head supports are so nice and I love the pouch on the pillow case. The back support feature is great as well when used on a soft surface like the couch. It is nice to clip it on and then be able to hold baby with one arm and get up if need be. I use this pillow during day and my Boppy at nighttime since you can't fit to pillow onto rocking chair."
1,Don't put this near your baby!,"My package just got here.. I unzipped the plastic and I couldn't believe the STRONG ODOR that was off-gassing. I got a headache immediately. I looked up ""Polyurethane foam"" and couldn't believe what I was reading! I wont have this near my baby! I had to put it in the garage.. I'd rather have a sore back than a SICK CHILD!""Polyurethane foam (essentially solid petroleum) is extremely flammable. To combat this hazard, industrial toxic fire retardants are added. The most common chemical fire retardant used to treat polyurethane foam has been pentaBDE, a toxin associated with hyperactivity and neuro-behavioral alterations. PentaBDE is not bound to the foam, and leaches out into the surrounding air.PentaBDE has recently been banned in Europe. It has also been banned by the State of California as of 2006. However, there is currently no planned government action to recall the millions of baby mattresses presently in use that contain pentaBDE."""
2,BUTTERFLY FAIRIE COSTUME,The costume was ok. Wings not as nice as shown in picture. But the price was good although the shipping was almost as much as the costume. I don't think i will order a costume from amazon again. The total cost (costume and shipping) was not such a good deal.
2,Hope you have Asprin.,"This is a mix of Trance and Techno. Horrible track sequence & selection.... The BPM is un settlling & it leaves me confused at times . I find myself really annoyed by some of these tracks. there are a few good songs such as ""Remember"" & ""Nostaglia"". but I don't know what was going on in the last few tracks... it was like a good enough track that was just chopped n screwed there is no set synth. bpm is way to fast and i dont know if it was intentional but whats up with all the scratching.. I LOVE ELECTRONIC Music i.e. House/ Tribal/ Electro/ ..etc. But this just gave me a headache. Cd 2 is all Trance.... BOOOOOOO! TRANCE Died."
2,Only worth 1/2 the price,"I am going to have to contradict Mr. Lex's affection for this release. Disc one is pretty good and at times...really really good (see track #4). However, the BPM gets a little too fast towards the end of this first CD with a very unimpressive last few tracks.Disc 2 is all trance. It's terrible and therefore makes this release only worth 1/2 the price."
5,Can't find locally,None of the local pharmacies who sell the pulmo-aide nebulizers carry replacement filters without having to special order them. The price I paid for 5 was less than locals wanted for one filter.
4,Good book - informative,"I had to buy this book as part of a college course curriculum.This book was well written and easy to read. I really enjoyed the material covered in the book.Of course, the professor of the course I was taking added a lot of personal material which was extremely helpful, but overall this was a great book for the course.There is definitely room for improvement as there were quite a few grammar and spelling errors in this book as well as two instances of absolutely incorrect legal information concerning family law which the professor had to bring to our attention."
5,Book for class,I needed this book for class and it as great. I want to go on and study family law and this book has a lot of information in that that I will keep it instead of selling it back.
4,"Family Law, 5th edition","This book is very good overview of family law, but I would have preferred more tables showing the difference in the individual states laws."
3,From Atlanta,"I found much in Leaving Atl to be authentic in many ways. The places, the language, the fear, the actual events -- all this was true. I loved the last line. But I saw a number of inconsistencies. The view of Octavia and her mother in the section Octavia narrates does not fit with the Tasha and Rodney narratives. The 2nd person didn't work in the Rodney section. Nonetheless, this book is definitely worth reading; the last section, narrated by Octavia, has some amazingly beautiful sentences."
5,SIMPLY GREAT,"THIS BOOK IS WONDERFULLY WRITTEN.I READ IT IN ABOUT 10 HOURS. MS. JONES KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF SEAT, WONDERING WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT AND IF ONE OF THE CHARACTERS WOULD FALL VICTIM TO THE ""CHILD SNATCHER"". THIS IS A MUST READ!"
5,Power Book,this Summer has been one story after another about Kids being taken away&this Book Reminded me of a very sad&troubled time period.I Remember wondering if what was happening in Atlanta could happen or would happen where I was living?things like that never leave you especially growing up as a Black Youngster.Tayari Jones brings so much out&more in this book.Incredible Presentation&strong Inside.One of the Best Books I've read over the past few years.
2,Sound Quality,"I have a very high end 2 channel stereo. This is a review of the sound quality only. From the prior reviews, many said this was the best sounding yet, with a 24-bit remastering. Well I A-B compared this with the same tracks off the 20-bit original recording remasters and they win without a doubt! Much better bass, mids and not as bright and hashy. For me, those are the best sounding Scorpions to date."
3,Marky view,"Good storyline,it is ok disappionted the comic book is in black and white, if youre my generation, reading glasses vital."
5,frankly speaking,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie. In the same genre as ""Maurice"", ""Wilde"", and ""Tipping the Velvet"", this timeless classic is truly rivoting and heartwretching to watch. The age of innocence was a period many seek to keep prime and proper, full of myths on social morality, when in fact, most educated, well travelled and sophisticated people (especially in the Arts)knew that this so-called benign period was the beginning of greater freedom of expression if one only dared challenged societal myths. This film is definitely one fit for the classical library collections, gay or straight. I am sure others customers will be as delighted with this film as I was. Bravo to you Amazon, for your brilliant selection of film!"
3,Pretty but downbeat,"Nigel Nicholson's book is a biographical gem and I expected a lot from the TV series. I was let down. It's prettily filmed, well acted and evokes the period well, but there was a petulant, downbeat feel to the screenplay that wasn't present in the book. Neither Vita Sackville West nor Violet Trefussis was presented sympathetically, which I felt belied the fact that both were sufficiently attractive in real life to interest many suitors of both sexes. The only character who came off well was Nigel Nicholson. Subliminal anti-gay bias in the production team? Despite this, I liked it enough to buy the DVD."
4,wonderfully filthy and awful,"Would rate this 5 stars but there is a longer version of this title that contains a couple of D & C classics missing here. Namely, Sex Manual and I Love You So Much I Can't S...t are left off. Well, you can listen on Youtube."
5,Good comprehensive review on affective neuroscience,"This book is really a very comprehensive collections over neuroscience of emotions, and its relevance in psychopathologies. It will broaden and deepen the reader about how relevance of neuroscience upon our understanding of emotions an emotional disorders."
2,Law barely rides,"Specifically regarding Alpha Video's DVD. Although this is a noteworthy film featuring Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson reunited during 1943 for the first of Monogram Picture's Trailblazer series, this version is not enjoyable.It is substandard and may have been transferred from VHS or perhaps a 16mm dupe print that was in bad condition as the picture is very soft with much surface noise, hits, glitches and lines plus intermittent missing frames. On a scale of ten, I give this a ""four"".I recommend seeking another version as this is visually disappointing especially since it is a very entertaining film."
1,I got shafted,"This DVD was sold to me and advertised as having ""Jack Elam"" as one of the actors. Jack Elam was not in this DVD and he had no part in its production. Instead of Jack Elam I got 83 minutes of bad acting, bad script, and nothing but grunts and growns. If you are a Jack Elam an DO NOT BUY this DVD. Jack Lam the star of this DVD is nothing like the real Jack Elam. I also would not wish this DVD on even those lovers of NINJA movies."
5,awesome CD!!!!,"music and lyrics are awesome, and very inspiring. i love listening to this CD, each song is very unique, unlike some groups where every song sounds the same. i highly recommend this CD!!!"
5,"shine,shine","We love it ,we love the songs . My 6 year old boy and my 7 year old daughter ask me to play it again and again , and my brother ask me to give it to him ,so I'm buying it again."
5,ROUGH RIDERS IN TOP FORM!!!,"This is probably the best, or at least the fan favorite ROUGH RIDERS entry of the series. We have Buck Roberts, Tim McCall and Sandy Hopkins ( our heroes ) drift into town seperately, as usual, to interact with the other cast members in order to solve the mystery killings and goings-on at the ghost town/ abandoned mine. Lots of cobwebs, hidden passages and a spooky old gothic mansion highlight the proceedings. It really has the feel of a 1940's Monogram horror film and one half expects either George Zucco or Bela Lugosi to be the mastermind behind it all. Lots of old time movie fun here with action-packed gunfights and fistfights as well. A great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. And the ALPHA dvd is one of the best I've seen for a ROUGH RIDERS feature, nice and clear, easy to watch......major bad guys to watch for include Tom London, Ben Corbett and of course, everybody's favorite, Charlie King, who gets whupped on good by Buck!"
5,EPIC ROMANCE AND SUSPENSE,"THIS BOOK IS A WONDERFUL JOURNEY THROUGH MEMORABLE CHARACTERS. iT'S ABOUT UNSPOKEN PROMISES AND TRUE LOVE. THERE IS SO MUCH TO THE STORY, IT IS LIKE GOING THRU TIME WITH YOUR FRIENDS. THERE WERE COUNTLESS OF INTERESTING LITTLE STORIES INTERLACED WITH THE MAIN THEME. I DID NOT WANT TO SEE IT END. IT IS A BOOK TO BE TREASURED BY THOSE WHO ENJOY READING ROMANCE AND FRIENDSHIP. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
3,Very thin paper,"This wallpaper went up in my daughters room and she loves it.The paper is very very thin and will tear easily once wet with paste if you are too aggressive with it, the design also will smudge easily if you are too aggressive in working out the bubbles. Be careful, take your time and use a smoothing brush to work out the bubbles. The paper grows quite a bit which can make matching up the design a challenge, on textured walls you will rub through the design if you are too aggressive, again due to the thinness of the wallpaper.This was the first time I have put up wallpaper, it came out nicely but it's probably not for first timers."
5,Beautiful!!!,"The Mural looks very beautiful, however we were very disappointed when she was not able to put it up in my granddaughter's room because she is leasing her house."
1,Wrong fitment from Amazon,"Although Amazon says that this brake caliper fits my 1985 Toyota Corolla GT-S Coupe (Rear Wheel Drive) it does not fit. The brake line fitting is in the wrong location, and the caliper is the wrong shape. I believe the proper Centric part number for my car is 141.44083, listed here:Centric Parts 141.44083 Semi Loaded Friction CaliperDon't buy this part unless you are sure you have the right part number."
4,finally honesty,"This book tells you honestly what it takes to succeed in network marketing. I realized this is not the path I want to take, too much work and heartache to overcome. It seems that there truly is no easy way out in any field, so find something you love doing, cause you will have to work hard. If you love network marketing, more power to you."
3,WAS great - (www.TheMLMSuccessVault.com),"Mark Yarnell is a GREAT man! He is tremendous leader and an extremely good coach/mentor of mine.When I fist contacted Mark about this book he told me in his own words not to buy this book because it was outdated - that's why I said it ""WAS"" great.However, he has a much newer book that is a MUST have that replaces the first called, ""Your BEST Year In Network Marketing"" and I promise you this book is everything ""Your FIRST year..."" was and more!If you just can't resist get this book, but also get, ""Your BEST Year In Network Marketing""I hope this helps someone!Be Blessed And Properous,- Travis Robinson, Jr.(...)email: iamreallybusy@hotmail.com"
1,book review,THIS BOOK IS TOO SPECIFIC AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY USEFUL INFORMATION TO USE IN CREATING REALIZEABLE PROFITS
3,Good reference book,"Didn't finish reading this book, but having been in NWM for ten years, it is a book for the home library. Good book to give newbies into the industry."
2,"Same old stuff, different cover.....","There are many books like this out there with the methods are out of date. Most successful network marketers build their fortune on the backs of others. There are some new twists on old approaches, the problem with most network marketing, MLM, multilevel marketing methods is the company's business model drives the behavior in the field and turns people into pushy, aggressive sales people, which causes huge failure in the industry.[...]."
4,Realistically Motivating,"This book is great when it comes to coaching you on the traps of MLM. I'm new to this and the book didnt explain the duplication process or ""go wide fast"" to a novice like me but i guess when I stumble it will make more since. Definetly worth the read."
1,"Your First Year in Network Marketing: Overcome Your Fears, Experience Success, and Achieve Your Dreams!","This information is old, worn out, proven failure methodologies. Anyone who works according to this info will fail. Guaranteed. I recommend against this garbage. It's old school. I recommend getting information that works in 2007."
5,follow his lead,"Mark Yarnell is amazing! Look at all the positive reviews. I am excited to follow him to the company he is with now, its called legacy for life. For anyone already involved in an mlm, follow his lead and check out the company he works with! good luck to all."
5,Your First Year in Netw3ork Marketing,Anyone who has joined a network marketing company needs to read this book. It's a bible for the network marketing industry.
3,The MLM road map to wealth,"Anyone thinking about, just got started or who happens to be thinking about getting started in this awesome industry, needs to invest in themselves and read this book. Why make the same mistakes when these 20 year veterans have already done so. All we have to do is be good students and learn from them. People make this business out to be something it's not. True we have been conditioned to have a boss and sit behind a desk but it doesn't have to be that way. The Yarnells can show you how to take back your life and be glad you did. There is no second chance."
5,Very Enlightening,A must-read for anyone considering doing an MLM. It presents the truth about what it takes to be successful. It is not easy! It takes much hard work and dedication.
5,Life 101,"Life is simple if we make it simple, purchase the book, read it and re-read a second time and this time study it and then put on your running shoes and get ready to jump over some hurdles. Ready...Set....Go..."
2,Beware of outdated print version! No reference to social media!,"I stumbled across this book on my iPad and was first shown the kindle version, which I believe is a newer version. However, I ended up ordering the printed edition and noticed that it was published in 1998. Not wanting to prejudge, I gave it a try anyways. While there are some good pointers on what to look out for during your first year, I think this book needs serious updating. The way we connect with people has changed dramatically over the past decade. A book on network marketing is just not complete and for me is useless, without any reference to social media. Also, with Skype and similar tools, long distance sponsoring becomes much less of an issue than the Yarnell's made it out to be. You don't have to spend 6 months at a foreign location to build an international team, if you already know people there!"
1,Be awared! You may get the abridged version.,"I got the abridged version instead of the one being shown on the site. It has only 60 pages and listed at $5.95, vs. I paid $9.52 for the full version which is supposed to have 270 pages at the list price of $16. I contacted Amazon's customer service and she told me I would get the same (abridged) book even if I ask for a replacement order. So I went for the refund."
4,Check it out,If you are new to network marketing this is a great book to start with. I would recommend it to anyone starting out in the business.
5,"Your First Year in Network Marketing: Overcome Your Fears, Experience Success, and Achieve Your Dreams!","I read the abridged version two or three times while waiting for the long version to arrive. I found the information in the long version more entertaining and provided in greater depth. More importantly, however, I found more information...period. I recommend the abridged version to all new comers but sponsors should encourage down-line to get the complete book as soon as possible. This book covers ways to avoid many of the causes of failure in MLM. It's like a well designed, easy to understand road map into the non-traditional business of Multilevel Marketing."
2,This is NOT the best one in the series,"This isn't exactly the best in the Sweet Valley Twins series. It's not very realistic at ALL. First of all, Jessica lies so she can win the ""Most French Family"" contest. OK, who would even come up with such a dumb contest idea? The most French family? Jessica wins, by some wild coincidence by lying that her family is French. The judge flies out from New York or wherever to visit the Wakefields. Turns out the rest of the family knows that Jessica has lied, so they play a trick on her. I'm sorry, but DUMB! I LOVE the Sweet Valley Twins books, but this one was a flop. If you are considering getting a Sweet Valley Twins book, try getting a different one."
1,A Total Flop,"I bought this book because i thought it would give me an acdemic explanation and analysis about Hamas and Islamic Jihad.It turns out to be a total flop and worthless; there is no analyses, no explanations, and no deep research, all the author does is mention names, dates, locations, and press releases.I was so upset to spend such a huge sum of money on it, and frankly i dont advise buying the book.You can get the same information by either clicking the website of the two organistions, or going to a newspaper archive and looking into the folders."
5,How To Build Trust in Personal Life and Business,"Some books have a way of teaching important lessons in a pleasant and enjoyable manner, without judgment, while clarifying otherwise complex and disruptive issues, and this is one of those books!In clear and simple language, with well illustrated examples, the authors demonstrate how the little things we overlook each day, compound until one day things go wrong. If we are not aware of these little things, we probably won't even know what happened.By gently informing the reader of the subtle ways that we damage our lives, we feel like someone should have told us sooner!I highly recommend this book for your personal life. If you read it for your business, you will enhance your business relationships. Virtually everyone in a business is accountable, and therefore they can benefit from this book. If you make it available to your key employees and sales teams, who probably have to meet many expectations, they will see the benefits.J.D. SalemTampa, FL"
3,Speech Acts,One of the best applications of using the Speech Acts to understand action while activating the observer that is you. Great means of simply using good communications to improve personal interaction and business acumen.
5,More Better...Most Bestest!!,Who Will Do What By When is a stellar little book with a BIG message we ALL need to hear and act on: Live in integrity and commitment and you'll achieve your every goal....it's that simple. Thank you Tom and Birgit for this easy but powerful read...a must for anyone who truly wants to go to the next level in life!
1,Insipid,"I picked up this book hoping to find some revealing clues about Pakistani women. Not in this book. According to most of the women interviewed, to be a Muslim is wonderful. Women are revered, up on a pedestal. One woman even claimed that ""Islam is the only religion that gives women the right to divorce"". No mention is given about anything remotely criticizing the religion of Islam. I found some of the author's questions to be rather shallow, such as, ""Is your life as a Muslim woman any different from that of your mother's or grandmother's?"" (as if time has not changed anything). On the whole, I found her book to be rather silly and patronizing. A much more interesting book on the lives of Muslim women can be found elsewhere. Don't waste your money."
3,dry but educational,"I might have wanted to be more entertained by this book than I was. The examples sited to elucidate the concept of synchronicity are few and far between, while the background and information utilized to elaborate the elucidations were drawn out in a very scholastic manner.(UH, there were too many words, it made my brain hurt) It could have used a tad more tabloid splash, and a tad less Professor Brainiac. For those with more than the attention span of a GenXer like myself, who are looking for scientific study, and cited examples with all the ""t""s crossed and the ""i""s dotted, this is an ideal publication. For those you want cheese, read "" the choking doberman"" by Jon Harold Brunvand, who understands the method by which this book should have been approached. ( Brunvand learns ya stuff, he just dont let ya know that you are learnin' it)"
5,Fascinating historical novel told from Roman & Jewish viewpt,"This book held my interest from the first pages. It's told from the Roman commander's viewpoint and the son of the Jewish leader who wants to be a physican and succeeds just at the time when he must kill those he loves. The last chapters had me in tears. It really brings alive the people and problems of the period. Imagine the Romans, surrounding the fortress, having to haul in water and supplies for months in the desert heat, and the Jews - trying to stop the building of the ramp which would let the Romans use their battering ram to break into their fortress. Don't have to be Jewish to find the book fascinating"
2,Thought L. l. Bean,"In my mind, not a good slipper at all, that is hand sewn in China. The left slipper toe area was sewn crooked so when you put the shoe on the slippers front toe area layed over to the left. Would NOT RECCOMEND these shoes for anyone thinking about quality!Sincerely,James Von TerschP.S. Sent them back!!!"
4,These were a gift for my husband.,"I had read all the reviews and opted to buy him a size larger. Well, that was not necessary. I returned the original puchase, and bought him the size he normally wears. They were a perfect fit! He loves the slippers and that makes me happy. They are substantial, good soles, warm and comfortable and he wears them all the time. The only reason I did not give them a perfect 5 rating is that the return process was a little troublesome. They did not exchange them and I had to wait for my refund before purchasing the smaller size. I would recommend these as a good quality product. Ordering a larger size it seems is not necessary."
4,I should have paid attention to the other reviews,"I like the slippers. They are a comfortable, high quality, American made slipper. I read a review before I placed my order which said they were sized small and the reviewer wished that he had bought a larger size. But my wife tells me I never listen so to remain in character I carefully measured my foot and purchased the appropriate size. They were too snug. I wish I'd bought the next larger size. However, a pair of shoe stretchers has helped a lot. I would recommend the slippers...in the next larger size."
3,Good Slippers...but,"These are great slippers, but they are heavy and suffocate the feet. I especially favor the moccasin style. Good buy at the price, but something of an ultra light weight slipper which has as durable sole as these would be better for me. Perhaps a nylon exterior which allows feet to breath would work..."
1,Size is way off,I was led astray by recent reviews here that stated the sizing issues had been resolved and these slippers now true-to-size. How wrong that was! The pair I received is about 2 sizes smaller than what is printed on the slipper. This vendor gets one star because the problem has been known and reviewed here many times before and they have still not corrected it.
1,"Cheap, ripped in less than 30 days. Horrible.",This is the worst product Ive ever orded on Amazon. I have had it for less than 1 month and already the shoes are ripped from the front seam. I am contacting seller about this and requesting a full refund. I WILL NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER! I PAID OVER $50 FOR THESE LOAFERS TO HAVE THEM RIP 1 MONTH LATER? NO I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A BETTER PRODUCT THAN THIS CHEAPER!
4,"Comfy, elegant moccasins","I bought these for my Dad and they were a little too big. He wears a size 10 1/2 so I bought him an 11 and it did not work out.He said they were very comfy, though, and they looked nice and elegant.I wish they had half sizes in these slippers... sadly they don't so I had to ship the pair I bought back."
4,Great Slippers!,I've been purchasing a new pair of slippers for my teenage son every year; mostly because the quality is poor and never lasts very long. These appear to be very well made and much more solid for wearing outside.They look very good and are warm. Fit is good. I'm hopefully they will last a long time.
3,Well Made But Seem to Run BIG,"First purchase of this style..seem to run big size wise, also very stiff feeling slipper,however they are well made..just not as comfortable as others I have owned."
5,Purchased for my husband,"I got these for my husband for Christmas to replace a pair he previously had that were starting to fall apart. When making a quick trip to run errands or to take the dog out, he slips on his 'house shoes' so it was important to have a solid tread on the bottom of the shoe and these are really great!"
5,it fits,It was nice to find a slipper that would fit my husband. It is a well made slipper and he is very happy to have them.
1,Poor Quality,"These slippers lasted less than 5 months before the top surface began tearing away from the stitching. Rather than throw them away at that point I made an emergency stiching repair only to find that in a month and a half, the top tore away again. They have not been worn that much to warrant such a failure in this time frame."
1,Blew Out at Big Toe in 1 Week!!!,My last pair of slippers lasted me about 7 years. The seam at my big toes on both slippersblew out in 1 week. they're falling apart. Total POS. Very disappointed!!!
4,Comfy slippers,"I bouught these for my son, as our house is mainly tile and hardwood, and we're getting into the slipper-wearing season. He loves them, but I'm not as happy with them as I had hoped. They're a bit loud on the floor, and I don't know if it's how he's walking or because it has a hard sole. He thinks they're great!"
1,Size 13 isn't. Slippers tore apart in less than 2 months,"Originally, I ordered a size 13, but it was way too small. Nicely, Amazon replaced them with Size 14's as it wasn't my fault that the slippers are undersized. The new ones fit fine and were quite comfy.After I wore them for about 2 months, I noticed a gap along the seam formed by the top and the sides of one of the slippers. The gap was caused by the leather ripping apart where the lacing goes. The gap continued to spread. Then the second slipper did the same.From the past reviews, it looks like its hit-or-miss whether you get a good pair or not. Definitely a miss for me."
4,Reviewed!,"I reviewed this a few weeks ago. The slippers came as order, on time and the quality good - all handled as I always expect from Amazon.Bill Mosher"
5,Awesome product,"I do not normally leave reviews for products, but these slippers are simply the best slippers I have ever worn. Additionally, I ordered the wrong size the first time around, and replacing them through the company was a breeze. These slippers are extremely plush in the inside, which keeps your feet warm. One thing that always annoyed me with some slippers is that my feet would get sweaty, however with the plush fabric in these slippers, that is not a problem. The lace on the front isn't just for show, but does tighten the slipper enough for one's individual preference. I am going to buy these slippers for several people in my family next Christmas."
4,Warm and comfortable,"These are nice and warm slippers. The lining inside is generous which makes it worth the price. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the strings never stay tied. This seems to be a problem with all Slippers that use this type of string though, so I wasn't surprised about that. They have good traction so don't plan on sliding around with these on. I got the EEE width which for the size I was ordering was as wide as I could get. Still would like a wider slipper, but slippers to me always seem to be on the slim side. Can't think of anything else so hope some part of this helped you."
1,"uncomfortable, too hot","I made a mistake ordering these slippers. The back is too short, the inside is too hot, and the whole shoe too tight. so, I returned it and bought through Macys a much more comfortable one."
5,Comfy,I PURCHASED THESE FOR MY SON IN-LAW FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE REALLY LOVES THEM and he even wore them to the hospital to vist a friends Mom since they have outdoor soles-wanted to try them out-since they were so comfortable
3,Very Comfortable; Only lasted 3 months,"I buy slippers to be worn as my main pair of footwear for around town and at work. My last pair of slippers wore out at about a year of use and they were not as nice as these. These slippers look great and are very comfortable, but the leather on the side of these slippers at the top stitching of the toe completely broke with less than 3 months of wear. Amazon was kind enough to offer me a refund. I highly suggest these slippers for moderate use; even though the soles seem to be built for much higher use the rest of the shoe is not built to that standard. Look elsewhere for slippers that are more rugged."
5,Relaxing and Beautiful,"I LOVE this CD! In fact, I love anything of Pachelbel that I can get my hands on! I know a lot of people, especially the younger generation, don't really like classical music, but I find this relaxing, harmonious, and beautiful. I simply find myself floating away on this music. Pachelbel was a wonderful composer and I can't see why he's not more famous. I think he was at least as good as Mozart. This music is a lovely must-have."
5,God as He really is,"For those that think this book is ""sad"", I can only say ""How sad for you""This is a POWERFUL book - filled with the truths of the Bible and how God (Jesus Christ) wants to relate to us in everyday life. To reject the truths of God in this book is to reject the joy and hapiness and peace that God brings.Frank Foglio humorously tells us how his family escaped the bondage of religious traditionalism and found a true relationship with God. One that frees us to live an overcoming life."
5,Super Fantastic! Wow!,"I first read this book when first published in the 70s and have frequently mentioned it to others. I did loan that book, way back when I first read it, to someone and it was never returned. Now I found it on Kindle and that is even better. I will read it at least once a year from now on. It has to be a true story - no one could be so much like Mama Foglio who is the person this is based upon.This little ""lady"" was a force difficult to be reckoned with in her quest to show others the simplicity of connecting with God. It is going to teach you in a gentle way to give your devotion to the Lord and not to some man-made religious entity as seen in so many churches today. Once you read it, you will be closer to your Lord - no doubt. It captures your heat, it is thought provoking as well as funny at the same time."
4,Unique and entertaining.,"This is different than most British mysteries. It has a narrator who pops in to clue you in and help narrate. These are actual crimes that he leads you to a conclusion. It is not quite up to a ""Downton Abbey"" standard of impecable scenes, costumes and actors. However, it is unique and very interesting. He shows you the actual places and helps you understand the people and there situations. If you are looking for a typical British mystery series, you might be a little dissapointed. If you enjoy looking into actual cases, following the clues and having someone explain who done it and why, this is the one for you. I didn't give it five stars because it is not a big production movie. It is one of the best buys in movies I have had in a long time. I wish there was more to this, a sequel or more in the series, but I can't find any. I would buy again and would even pay a higher price for more in this series."
3,A Most Mysterious Murder,The seller is A+++ the video was interesting but not one I would keep in my DVD collection
3,Snugli Serenade Vibra Soft Carrier,"Overall as far as looks the carrier exceeded my expectation. The vibration is quite niffy and the music which suppose to soothe the baby serves no purpose at all; it's stored it a pocket in the carrier and you can barely hear it. A drop of a pin is louder than the music. It has great padding on the straps, but when it comes to comfort I give it two thumbs down. It's a killer on your back. When I had my baby on my back it seems that no matter how close I adjust the straps my baby seems to lean away from me. This never happen to me with the older Snugli front/back carrier I had. I had this carrier for a week and I had to return it."
2,Not that comfortable,"I like the idea of this product, but the gel padding in the straps was more painful than the original snugli (which I can wear for a few hours at a time). They need to make the straps more comfortable and give instructions on how best to adjust them! I returned the product after a few days of use. I hope Snugli comes out with another (more comfy) carrier with the cupholder though!"
4,mad skills,"This girl has mad skills. Given the proper promotion and air play, the world will see what a gift Tamyra has. She has remarkable control over her voice rivaling Whitney Houston."
5,BEST AMERICAN IDOL RELEASE YET!!,"I've bought other music from the American Idol series, but this CD by Tamyra Gray is by far the best of the group and that's saying a lot because I really liked Ruben's CD as well. But Tamyra is unique and I like her flavor. She has the range of ""the old"" Whitney Houston, the smooth voice of Chante Moore and the strong lyric of India Arie. I think this album proves who really should have won Season One of American Idol. Now, Lord knows, I can't wait for Fantasia's release! Great job, Tamyra!!"
2,Pure Cheese,"I suppose this type of music has an audience but it smacks of been there done that. She has talent but she needs direction to realize her full potential. There is nothing really memorable about her voice or style that will cause you to keep listening. It's a nice CD and you wont hate it you just wont play it much.I feel more sorry for Fantasia as she has to release a Tamyra song as a single. At least Tamyra had the good sense not to put it on her album. Tamyra was clearly foist upon us in the last Idol and they are certainly pushing her for success, I just don't know that it will be realized until she is better produced and managed. As others have said writing is not her strength. This CD needs direction and she needs some difinitive style that will separate her from the herd"
5,Infinitely better than The Duck's CD!,"Good songs, great vocals, one of the best AI CDs ever released. A fitting consolation to make up for the horrendous all-squeaks CD released by no-talent overrated Donald Duck Barrino."
3,Not upto her potential but not too bad,"After listening to her performances throughout AI competitions, I was expecting more from her debut album. She does a good job singing but the songs she sings are nothing special.This singer has a lot of potential. If she picks songs that are more robust, her next album should be great."
3,hmmmmm...not that bad,"thumbs up from me, and I have to admit I NEVER saw her on A.I.I love the slow songs and the up tempo songs are nice as well. Maybe Ruben should have worked with her producers. the cd is much more soulful. check it out, it won't disappont"
4,Pure Pleasure,"Wow! This Album is a pleasure to listen to. Tamyra is talented, and in prespective, she wrote most of the tracks on the album. For her first album, it's quite good. You all got to give her a try...it's different, and we all know she was good enough to win the 1st idol...go Tamyra."
2,CHEESY DEBUT!!!!,"I love(d) Tamyra on season one of AI. I thought that she was an AMAZING talent, and I still believe that. After hearing her album, I am starting to think that she is nothing more than a karaoke singer. Her lyrics are full of boring cliché's and her songs are pretty bland. Her voice is not fully exposed on this album. I am very dissapointed Tamyra!"
1,Please do NOT buy this crap,"This album is what is wrong with music. Just people trying to make a few bucks, not caring about the quality of the music. All of these songs are so cliche and bad. Tamyra has a great voice, but the music is garbage."
2,is this what we waited for?,"tamyra gray is a good singer, but so what??? fans have waited two years for her album to be released, and it falls very short. taryma tries to be different and be a singer/songwriter, but when someone writes their own songs, it does not mean the songs are good. i watched taryma unvieled her work on this seasons American Idol, and im like, ""is this girl for real?"" she had a chance to showcase her work for a mass public, so of course she had to sing good songs to promote her self. 'star' and 'rain drops will fall' sucked. isnt 'star' like mariah's 'make it happen'? and isnt 'RDWF'? like 'through the rain'? i listenend to her album when it leaked on the internet, and she is not original at all. her lyrics are so juvenille and cliche, and on top of that, her melodies are not even good. im not a hater, im an honest music fan. if its good, i'll say it's good, if it's not, then it's not. tamyra can sing, but her songs are not good."
2,good voice but weak material,Her voice is on point through out for the most part but the Material is lacking any kind of depth.this is a debut that Should have been better balanced out.
1,Gray Won't Make Green,This was possibly the worst release from all the AI artist. Raindrops Will Fall indicates that Grays skies are ahead and this artist is in trouble. Stop trying to be a song writer and just sing song.
5,Excellent!! Excellent!! Excellent,"Out of all the CD's of the American Idol Contestants, this is most definitely the best one. Tamyra has an amazing range and the songs offer something for everyone. Run don't walk to the store and buy this CD."
5,BRAVO!!!,"Can we say the next Whitney Houston but will be better. I always knew Tamyra had it in her since Season 1 began. I still think Kelly Clarkson is better in most aspects but Tamyra is right on her tale. But of course we do not have to worry about those two competing, they are friends. But definitely a must get album for those AI fans. It is awsome and the vocals are amazing. yes, five stars is correct. She deservs five stars!!!! Way 2 go Tamyra."
1,Nothing unique from Tamyra Gray,"You could hear this CD if you buy any other pop CD from Britney, Kelly Clarkson, or Christina. What a slap in the face for her to have to record this. I think she should have steered clear of the sappy, cliche pop. She showed so much potential on American Idol, but this album just shows that these American Idol contestants are not talented musicans, just cheesy pop singers."
2,hmmm,"I'm always leery of albums that don't allow you to sample them a little before purchasing them! I learned my lesson when I bought Clay Aiken's CD without hearing part of it first, won't make that mistake again, until i can sample some of the songs on this CD I'm not plunking down any cash on it! I gave her the benefit of the doubt only based on what I've heard her do in the past."
1,disappointed,"I waited a long time for this CD, and I am not impressed at all with the outcome. The writing is terrible, if this is why RCA dropped her then I finally understand... it's dated cheese at best. Her voice is awesome as usual, but not good enough to make up for the bad songs. I hope Tamyra gets a chance to make a second album and lets other people write some of the material."
3,*Sigh*,"Once again, I was expecting more. After not missing a single episode of any season of American Idol, and seeing these kids sing their hearts out on stage every week, I have come to expect nothing but amazement from their debut CDs. With the exception of Kelly Clarkson's debut, I have yet to be amazed. Clay's was alright, Ruben's was...ha...anyway, Kimberley Locke's was okay, and Tamyra...oh man. Utter disappointment. Being one of my favorites, I was psyched when I heard when her CD was coming out, I bought it THAT DAY. There are only about 4 decent songs on the whole CD. The rest are fillers. I give 3 stars for her voice, which, of course, is awesome. The songs need MUCH fine tuning."
2,"See You Later, Tammy","It is just laughable how Tammy is being presented as this ""serious"" singer/songwriter. Face it, she is merely a mediocre singer and songwriter, and she has nothing to distinguish herself from the rest of the singers out there. My prediction: Her first and last record."
1,Nothing unique from Tamyra,"You could hear this CD if you buy any other pop CD from Britney, Kelly Clarkson, or Christina. (...) I think she should have steered clear of the sappy, cliche pop. She showed so much potential on American Idol, but this album just shows that these American Idol contestants are not talented musicans, just cheesy pop singers."
1,THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE TERRIBLE!!!,"Tamyra Gray has talent. The songs on this CD are terrible so it does not showcase her talent. It even questions it. Enough is enough people. Stop buying into this American Idol travesty and wake up!!!!! No more American Idol for me!! They have ruined it all with this release which was much anticpated but is fizzling out quicker than one can say ""SUPASTAH""!"
5,"""A+""","Tamyra took Her time and did a very good job with this project. I, for one, am thankful She took a different path with her music and wrote songs of innocence, self love, and happy times. Her vocal ranges are superbly strong. This CD in time, will become a household favorite and truly deserves to be a #1 chart topper."
3,"Good, solid debut",I like this CD. It's really a 3.5 rating. It isn't going to blow you away but it's a definitely one to pick up if you're a TG fan. I just recommend buying it used. More of a pop sound than R & B but her vocals are very strong and then delicate when required.
5,This girl trully has a gift!,I love this album. I can't stop listening. She is really talented and has such a pure voice. I'm waiting for more from her cause I know she'll be around for a while with that talent
2,ehh...I don't know...???,"Other reviewers think that Tamyra should have been the eventual winner of AI1. But clearly, after listening to half of this album, and hearing her shakey perfomance of the Star Spangled Banner on American Idol, she has showed that she should not have made it to the top four. Maybe the top 6 would have suited her more. The only song that blew me away was, ""Raindrops Will Fall."" Such songs like ""Legend"" and ""Ha Ha"" had lyrics that meant absolutely nothing.Album: 6/10""Raindrops Will Fall"" 10/10""Star"" 8/10"
2,Disappointed,"After all of the hype over Tamyra being the best singer from AI1 and being voted off too early, I was very excited to hear her new cd. I must say I was disappointed. There was nothing new or different about her voice or her songwriting. I was expecting a more R&B sound. This album is a bigger flop that Justin Guarini, in fact, it seems none of the Idols other than the big three are having any more success than Justin. Says something about the ""talent"" on this show. It's more about who gets the most promotion than about the talent."
1,Don't buy it,"It's an absolute waste of money. Her lyrics are so cliche. ""Pot of gold at the end of the rainbow"" Come on, she is not creative at all. I was at first impressed that she wrote her own songs, but then I heard them and I was not impressed. Her CD is horrible, I don't know why people would buy it."
2,Disappointment,"This album has the worst producers ever. This girl can sing, but her voice is wasted on such pathetic excuses for songs. Tamyra, do yourself a favor, and never work with those people again!"
1,Tamyra cd,"Seems to me Tamyra's cd might be getting more promotion than Justin's, funning thin is if its so great then why is Justin' still sell more in the first to weeks.as for good cd's Kelly's is the best, and then Justins, I can't get into Tamyra's."
1,is she for real?,"ummm.... i bought this cd because there are so many ""5 stars"", but i don't really get the hype. i found it intensely boring. she has a nice voice, but..... i want my money back."
2,"Good singer, good voice, horrible material","I think that the truth is Tamyra Gray is an UNDENIABLY good singer. Give her an ordinary song, and she can do wonders with it. But the real problem with such an album all has to do with the weak material in this album. Given that she penned most of the song lyrics for the album, it is ironically self-defeating that she took an active part in defeating her own music career by trying her hand at such song writing without any guidance. In addition, I was surprised that given the two years' wait, it all turned out that the standard of the songs were at best running ""thin"" and superfluous in terms of their themes(dreams, rainbows, falling out of love etc.). They can potentially bore someone like me who believes that she is one of the best voices around in the current music industry to run against the main current of selling sex, sex and more sex."
2,Just Another Whitney Wannabe,"I get soooo tired of these American Idol Singers who Simply copy the style of the likes Of Whitney Houston , Mariah carey and Celine Dion! You will hear nothing on Tamyra's cd that you havent heard before! Her voice is okay but all the songs are so Sugary Sappy! Thank God Fantasia Barrino Won The Latest American Idol< Now she ie an Original!"
3,Raindrops will fall... naturally,"This isnt the best album by an ex AI contestant, but it certainly can be described as the start of something great. If the record label pushes a few key singles this album could do very well. Tracks like ""Raindrops.."", ""Yesterday/today"" and ""Dont stop"" all have the potential to be chart hits in the US. The only thing holding her back is the fact that she's the first artist signed to the label, and the push to radio doesnt seem to be strong enough. She has yet to have her songs played on the radio, no mention of touring, and could suffer the same fate as Justin Guarini if something isnt done soon. A few good single choices, a few good videos and some press time could push her to the top. She certainly deserves it. Its not like we have an abundance of singers who can actually sing. Give this album a chance. It might not ever be a hit, but after hearing ""Raindrops will fall"" you'll have to admit that this could be the start of a brilliant career. ""Could""."
2,I love Tamyra But was Very Disappointed in this CD,"I have been a Tamyra fan since I saw this incredibly classy lady in season 1. Her delivery on AI was second to none. After having waited 2 years for this album, I was sorely disappointed by the ""weak"" songs on it. To her credit I applaud her for wanting to write her own songs, but the lyrics and arrangements are ""bubble gum"" at best. Tamyra would have been much better off had she had an accomplished team of writers, producers etc. do her debut album. If Tamyra is blessed with another opportunity to make a cd, I would hope that she would seek the assistance from seasoned professionals!Much love Tamyra, but better luck next time!"
5,A music lovers must have,"This is one of the best albums that I have heard in a long time. She has a wonderful voice, and sings songs that actually have meaning. If you are a true music lover, you will love the cd. I would give it 6 stars, but it's not allowed."
5,Out of this World Debut Album!!,"This young lady can sing!! This album is far superior to even my favorite idol, Clay Aiken! Her songs, which she wrote herself!!, are inspiring, upbeat and extremely soulful! My life right now needs inspiration and Tamayra gives me that everytime I listen to that beautiful voice! I can't wait to hear more from this powerful and extremely talented singer! I highly suggest that everyone adds Tamarya to their CD collection!"
4,"This would actuality be a 4.5 stars, but they didn't have it","This CD is awesome! The only people who give it a 1 star review are the upset clay kelly and justin fans. This album is incredible, and it blows my mind that she wrote 12/13 songs. The CD starts with star, a really good song, but not nearly the best. The highlights of the album are Raindrops Will Fall, Good Ol' Days, Faces, and God Bless teh Dreamer. Every song on this album soars except The 2nd song, which is the reason why it is 4.5 stars. Overall, amazing debut!!!!! I LOVE TAMYRA!!"
1,Worst album of the year,"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I didn't buy it, i just listened to a little bit of it at FYE. I had to turn it off after 2 minutes. Do America all a favor and do not buy this crap. Send a message by not buying this and maybe we won't have to hear this American Idol crap ever again."
5,Good album!,"Interesting mix of songs, but consistenly good singing. The opposite of the Queen of Ghoul's recently released and very overrated ""all-squeaks"" album."
2,The sales say it all,"I want to start by saying that Tamyra Gray has a really great voice. One that is on par with Kimberly Locke, Kelly Clarkson, and much better than 3rd place Nikki McKibbin. Tamyra Gray is also an excellent song-writer and her songs like Raindrops Will Fall are truly superb. But - there is something missing. Keep in mind that her CD The Dreamer sold less copies in its opening week than any other American Idol CD, only (approximately) 35,000 copies. Tamyra is missing a star quality and energy that makes a performer. I would reccomend BLUE SKIES by Diana DeGarmo instead of...or in addition to if you are a fan of Tamyra."
2,"Boring singer, cheesy tunes","zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!! Oh sorry, I must've faded out there for a minute. This album has some great tunes to help you sleep. Tamyra is a pretty spotless vocalist but a absolutely horrid song writter. Her vocals are pretty good though nothing at all is special about it. Yeah, she hits the notes and stuff but she has the most generic sounding, uninspiring tone to her voice I have ever heard. I don't know who told the girl her song writting was good, or even acceptable, but the songs on this album are even cheesier than the songs that have been pushed on other AI contestants. I appreciate the fact she is trying to succeed on mostly her own merits but this album falls way short of great or even good. I couldn't be more disapointed."
2,Better luck next time,Tamyra Gray is without question the best voice to come out of the American Idol Stable. It is a shame that her label would allow her talent to be wasted. This is the woman who sang Dance with my father on Boston Public and did a better job than Luther will ever do. This CD does not allow you to hear the best that she can do. It has reduced her great vocal talent to that of a Karoake singer. I am glad I did not have to pay money for this. Save your money for when you can hear her live or hunt down copies of her appearences on American Idol. She is worth the price to hear her in person. You will not be disappointed
5,Superb,"Tamyra Gray, you've made it!What an amazing album. Two thumbs up!""do you remember me? we were seventeen..."""
5,At Last!,"Finally, the much anticipated and long-awaited debut album of Tamyra Gray. And as others have stated, this cd was definately worth the wait. Ms. Gray is an amazing vocal talent and a budding song-writer. There's not a bad sog on the cd. My favorites are Ha Ha, Raindrops Will Fall, God Bless The Dreamer, and Good Ol' Days. I'm sure this is just the first of many albums from this versatile artist. Congratulations Tamyra; you deserve much success and critical acclaim!"
5,American Idol Indeed!,"All I can say is ""FIVE STARS!!!"" This is a great debut album by Tamyra Gray and with it, I think she proved once again that America doesn't always vote for the best candidate. This album was worth the endless wait and I look for greater things for this talented beauty as her career blossoms into its fullness."
4,Great Album,"I am so happy for Tamyra that she has been able to achieve her dream. I am very impressed with this album. Love songs, songs that inspire, you go girl! I enjoy listening to every song but ""17"". This album really shows her hard work, and kudos for being involved in the writing process of EACH song. I enjoy an album MUCH more when the artist writes the material. GOOD JOB Tamyra!"
4,Well worth the wait.,"'The Dreamer' is a great debut for Tamyra Gray. Not only is she a talented singer, but also co wrote 12 out of 13 songs on her album. The songs span various genres but it all works together as a finished product. For someone who has grown weary of the direction that R&B and Pop music have gone to in recent years, I have to say that Tamyra is definitely not a cookie cutter singer. She's the real deal.My favorites on the album are HaHa, 17, Don't Stop, and Good Ol' Days. Also God Bless the Dreamer, cause I am a big gospel fan. I would have like more songs like HaHa, which has a sorta neosoul groove, but I like it that Tamyra was able to show the naysayers that she is not a one trick pony as she has been accused of. So for just having a first listen, the album has already impressed me. And I can't wait to see how she continues to grow and perfect her songwriting skills in the future. Congratulations on a job well done!"
2,Tamyra Needs To Find Her Own Voice,"Tamyra sings well and I'll give her credit for that, but there are times I think she copies 70's disco and Christina Aguilera. I think Tamyra needs to take time to find a sound all her own. That's unless she doesn't mind singing covers of other people's songs and singing styles. I would have given her 3 stars for a decent effort, but this CD is too shaky for me to give her another star."
1,I was so excited to see this come out but now disappointed!,I really liked the raindrops song...but the rest of the cd. I was frankly bummed. It is so disappointing. I listened to it on Itunes and I was so disappointed. I purchased raindrops and that was all :(
2,Mediocre CD for Outstanding Voice,Tamyra was not given songs that use her voice to its strongest capabilities. She has a great voice but it is not defined anywhere in the songs on this CD. Maybe Tamyra will read these reviews and make a new album that uses her vocals to their best potential.
3,"Long & Behold, The New Whitney Has Arrived","Though this debut isn't the greatest, Tamyra's vocals soars. You get the sense of someone who is new to the business, but who will, with time, evolve into one of our most cherished artist. Songs such as the opening track ""Star"", and ""Raindrops Will Fall"" are testaments to her talent as a singer and songwriter. The key track is the final cut, ""God Bless The Dreamer"", which showcases amazing vocal talent that that brings to mind a fresh and young Whitney. This album has many small pleasures, and also makes us remember why we were all so outraged that Tamyra didn't win the first season of American Idol."
5,Better than the rest,"This album shows why she should have won the first american idol. Her debut is far better than kelly clarksons and any other idol to have released an album. Great songs, great voice and great spirit. She is so truly talented!! its amazing. great album.....!!!! a must buy."
5,AMAZING:),i love 11/13 of the songs which is rare for me to like so many songs from 1 album... TAMYRA RULES:)
4,Great CD - One Suggestion,"I have always been a fan of Tamyra's and looked forward to her CD coming out. I just listened to her CD a couple of times and for the most part I love it. I am not sure what happened with her original label but I would give Tamyra one piece of advice that I heard Avril Lavigne say. To paraphrase it was you always have to remember that you need radio to make your CD successful. Avril stated that ""skater boi"" is not really her kind of song but she had to write a few songs for radio. So my suggestion to Tamyra is that on her next CD that she remembers to write some upbeat songs for radio, or allow someone else to write those songs, but she can still be true to herself and write others. It's worth a pop song or two to get people to listen to your other songs. But those of you who are not concerned about that will love this album. The songs are great!!"
3,Agree to disagree,"I must agree with both the negative and the positive responses seen in the review. Most of the songs aren't standouts that would grab your attention relentlessly carrying you to new hights, and yet they are not totally without some merit either. I agree for a first shot by a new comer, it will pass. Yet, to be a star the artist must reach deep within and forget the pop culture which influnces all."
4,You guys have me scared to listen to it!!,"OK, I just heard her first single on the radio for the first time...it's OK, but just ok. I like Tamyra. Sweet spirit, beautiful girl, but that song was not hot. It was ok..in that American Idol ""pop star"" kind of way. Oh, and I agree with all those who say that these AI people try to emulate Mariah and Whitney cuz I could hear it in that trackAnyways, I like TG so I gave it four stars. I wish her the best. But, I'll probably wait til the price is next to nothing before I buy it."
5,Music Fan,I think this CD is great. It offers variety. I think it can do a lot better but the distribution was poor. It was hard to find the album but I'm glad I have it!
1,Big disappointment,"Like many others, I waited for Tamara's cd with heartfelt anticipation! Loved her on Idol and when she performed this year as well...she took my breath away! The CD, unfortunately, is a huge let down. Her song writing seems amateurish at best. I would have rather heard her sing songs by a more established writer, or remakes. Come on- where's Over the Rainbow that she floored us with??Great talent, we all know she has it...but this was a big let down. (Oh, and could she have thanked anyone else on her CD sleeve???)Sorry, hope you do better next time!"
5,Amazing....Amazing...Amazing,What can I start out with? WOW. Tamyra's Cd is by far the best of the American Idol contestants. Her songs are so well written and she sings them with all the emotion.Some of my personal favorites areHa HaRain Drops will FallGod Bless the Dreamer17LegendDont StopMake sure you get this Cd. She is a Diamond and it's time for her to shineWe are proud of you Tamyra!!
5,Awesome debut!!! Good Job Tamyra!!!,"This absolutely the best Idol CD out there. This CD proves she should have won. Her CD is way better then Kelly's and Justin's. Heck it beats Ruben, Clya and Kimberley's. The other Idol artist are all one trick ponies meaning they only sing one type of music. Tamyra mixes it up and the result is wonderful. My favorite on the album is ""Faces"" it has a rock edge to it and is very mainstream. Tamyra should release that song has her single. Well anyway, good job Tamyra hope to her more music from you soon."
5,Song mixup,"The reviewer below who said that Tamyra did not write ""Raindrops will fall"" is confused. There is a song called ""Raindrops keep falling on my head"" which was sung by B. J. Thomas (lyrics by Hal David/music by Burt Bacharach) from the movie Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid. This is not the same song, my dear."
2,Fire the writers,The vocal talent is there but the mediocre songwriting doesn't support the stellar voice. I was hoping for better.
4,Consider it with other books,"This book is cute, but a little small. If your child is interested in reading books or turning the pages, consider this book. My child, 11 months, just likes to throw books around the house, chew on them or close them without going through the pages. See how your child does with other books before buying anything."
2,"Small book, small value","It's cheap so you can't complain too much. But there is not much to the book either. A bigger book with more pages would give a parent more time to show, explain and otherwise interact with the baby and book."
2,Hardly trying,Baby Einstein's videos are very high quality. Too bad many of their other products don't meet those same high standards. This book is tiny and boring (even by baby standards.)
4,Still a favorite,We have had this book for over a year and it is still one of my 20 month old daughter's favorites. We read it frequently and from the look of it you can see it is well loved. The babies are fun to look at and the words are appropriate for very young infants and toddlers that have short attention spans. I would say this book is a must for anyone with an infant just learning to listen to stories. It will stay around for a long time.
3,"A little small, but very cute!",My baby likes to hold this book and he seems to like the pictures. I was expecting more pictures of babies faces. It seems a little short and small for the price.
2,Not what I expected at all,I was surprised at how small this book was. And the pictures were less than exciting. I was expecting something more visually stimulating for my grandaughter. I have other Baby Einstein products but this one I cannot recommend. Sorry!
3,"It's ok, kinda disappointing","The size doesn't bother me, my baby likes that. But the pictures are pretty blah I thought, especially since everyone raved over them. I don't think there's many pictures in the book that would appeal to a baby - a black and white pencil drawing, a couple paintings. I was disappointed. The picture on the cover is probably the best one."
5,oops,"I bought this, thinking it was what I needed. I was wrong, and returned it. It was exactly as I expected though!"
4,Cool...,"Imagine yourself there when you listen to this fine compilation, and you will be! A fine album."
4,Works Great,So far so good.I received the batteries a few days after i ordered them..I have been using them for a little while now and they are still holding up.
1,Leaky batteries for sale!,"I don't know if it were in transit or in storage but this is the first time I've purchased batteries that were leaky from the start before any use. Maxell should get out of the battery business, and what good is a free battery if you can ruin your equipment with acid?"
5,Wonderful,I had enjoyed the first two Yada Yada books in this series and this book was just as good. I feel as if I have participated in their prayer group through the first three books and am looking forward to #4!
5,Love it!,I love all the books in this series. I recommend starting at Book 1...it is not a series that I feel you could jump into in the middle. Can't wait for more in the series!
4,4.5 Stars for the Yada Yadas,"The Yadas Yadas are back again and they are each continuing to grow and learn more about not only themselves but about the God they serve. This series of books continue to be a good read but also allow for your own personal introspection. When I first started reading the series, I identified with Jodi mostly but as I have continued reading (and growing spiritually I hope), I can see myself in different aspects of all Yada Yadas. Each Yada Yada comes across many of life's stresses and joys but they continue to learn that their faith and prayer can help them deal with and conquer all of these things. This is a good book and a great series."
2,Definitely not as good as the first two books in this series!!,"I read the first Yada Yada book and was instantly hooked. So I read the second, then ordered the third and fourth together. It took me about 5 days to read both the first and second books, but the third one I've been working on since July! I cannot get interested in this book, and the events happening in this 3rd book are just simply boring. Since I've already paid for the 4th book and it's waiting on me to finally get through this 3rd one, I sincerely hope it's better. I was really excited to find this series, and recommended it to everyone, but had I read this third book first I wouldn't have been at all impressed nor recommended it - while it's not a BAD story, it simply does not stand out nor does it hold my interest or touch my heart as the first 2 books did.So...here's hoping to a better experience with the 4th Yada Yada book!"
1,disappointing,"Never received, it's been a little over a month, have been in contact w/shipper, said they would send re-fund... have received that yet either. Very discouraged from doing this again....Guess that's what happens when your excited about buying a book for $7, should've just went to the book store and bought it brand new for $14, would've been worth it!"
1,Wrong Ad,"I was so excited only to receive a pair of men's shoes that I had to send back and tried to tell you to change the ad as it showed up as women's shoes. Now you have finally changed it to ""men's"" and you can not think I could possibly give you a good review. Is there anything less than one star - very disappointed!"
4,Didn't think I'd ever read such an expose,"I was given this book by a friend to 'read and return.' It was so good that I wanted my daughter to read it, so I ordered one. Good vendor too."
4,Days of Wine and Roses CD,"Good for diehards of Sinatra, or even fans of classic movie songs, mostly from the '60s. With the Oscars right around the corner, this will help to whet your appetite. A cut above ""A Man and His Music"", which I also purchased off Amazon."
4,Don't Miss This One,This album is another example of why Sinatra and Riddle worked so well together. You might think you that this is just a warmed over collection of show tunes but you would be wrong. This is a collection that shows how the exceptional can make even the familiar special. Frank is strong and clear and Nelson has the Band playing in a creative style throughout. Enjoy!
2,Buyer Beware...,"A long-forgotten 1966 summer replacement series for ""The Red Skelton Show"" makes its way to DVD via Timeless Media Group. ""Hippodrome"" was a variety show combining performances by great musical acts of the day along with some of Europe's top circus acts.If you are expecting complete shows, don't look to this DVD set. As always, the legal nightmare of music and performance clearances has resulted in these shows being heavily edited. All the great musical guests have been removed, leaving each show with an average running time of 24 minutes (from the original 51 minutes).Timeless Media does get credit for even considering the release of such an obscure item from television's past, but the removal of such critical content makes it hardly worth the effort."
2,"Helpful, but Minimal Effectiveness","I purchased this scalp liquid because I bought Psoriasin Ointment and that worked like a charm on the areas I could easily access. I thought that this would more easily handle my scalp above the hair line. However, I found that this product only helped to temporarily reduce itching and did relatively nothing to reduce the other symptoms. The point is that although Psoriasin makes both products, their healing qualities differ greatly."
3,Prefer the earlier version for Scalp,I use this product for problems with Dandruff. Unfortunately the nozzle of the bottle is changed and due to this I am having problems in uniformly applying the liquid on the scalp.
5,"Profound and a gem of a film, with multiple facets, nuances and eternal sparkle","Wendy Hiller and Harry Andrews deliver haunting and very, very beautiful performances in this, one of the best films I have ever seen. It is all--every bit of it--utterly charming, provocative, true, beautiful, and brimming with life in every scene.And the reviews that speak of Vita's feminism, though true, miss entirely the point that this film is as completely relevant socially, emotionally, and spiritually now as it was in Vita's 1930's.The film is not glitzy, or fast, or loud, but it is one of my few all-time favorite films. Like the rest of them, it seeps into one's soul like wine falling slowing through water, eventually coloring one's whole view of life. You will not be quite the same once you have given yourself the gift of All Passion Spent."
3,All Passion Spent from AMAZON,"As always, buying from AMAZON is great. The movie was a little disappointing, It is slow moving, but the title tells all."
2,No Subtitles,"I do not originally come from an english speaking country, but I really enjoy English films. I was excited to have seen this in DVD at Amazon and bought it immediately. Unfortunately, to my disappointment, it has no subtitles."
3,Good reading & fun to try the recipes of your favorite Inn..,"This book includes both descriptions of the Inns and some of their recipes. Arranged by state, you can turn to your favorite Inn and try one of their recipes. It can be a little difficult to use though if for example your looking for a specific category like pancakes. The pancake recipes are all listed together in the index but you have to switch back and forth a lot to check out the recipes. The recipes range from simple, corkscrew bacon (pg. 344) to different and delicious Danish abelskiver (pg. 361)."
2,Confused & Bitter,"I loved Ratt and I have enjoyed Pearcy's solo material for the most part but between Stripped and Fueler, I've lost a little respect for the man. The effort just isn't there anymore and the whole ""I was a rock star and I created Ratt"" bs is getting old. Listen to Pearcy's ramblings between songs on Stripped. This is not a happy performer. Also, Chuck Wright's bluesy bass lines seem out of place here with the Ratt tunes and some of these songs don't really sound much like the originals. I'm all for changing things up a bit when performing live but the way that some of these Ratt songs are arranged here is a real stretch. I gave Stripped two stars instead of one because of the cover tune ""Oh Well"". It is the one bright spot here."
4,A real surprise!!,"A really great take on Stephens work. Sound quality was really good, and everything worked really well. I enjoyed listening to this and think any Ratt fan would too!"
5,Fun for early listeners and readers,"As a parent of a 3 year old and a first grade teacher, I highly recommend this book. There are fabulous rhymes, interesting pictures, and an underlying message that you can help your child ""mine"" as he/she reads it over and over. It's the favorite at pre-school and a great book for teaching vowel sounds to early readers, especially short u. Teachers may want to have the children act it out as well or do related art projects."
5,Excellent!,"This is some hip hop you can go bump to ... raise the praise with some holy hip hop! Where my freaks at baby, where my freaks, where my Jesus freaks!"
1,Terrable !!!!!,Man this cd is terrable the vocals are lacking very much!!! This is the first death metal group I have ehard that I really HATE if you like death metal dont buy this in fact dont even look at it its terrable the guitars are terrable and the drums are really bad please for all of which is evil in the world dont buy this cd it really REALLY stinks
2,Not for girls with hips and thighs,I am a size 8-10 and these did not work out for my measurements. The band that holds up the tights cut off circulation and created an unflattering fat flab that hung over the top. I tried using a garter belt but that failed to resolve my issues. The netting was nice though.You must need smaller thighs and legs to wear these.
1,Painfully Tight,"The elastic at the top is so tight they are completely unwearable. I'm 5'10"" and 120 lbs. and if I can't wear them - one size definitely DOES NOT fit all. Major bummer."
4,A must for Western history readers,This is a true story of a man in the South Dakota territory between end of the Indian Wars and the settling of the homesteaders. This will fill the void that this time period is seldom written about.
2,broke the first day,"I extended and closed it four times. After the forth time,one part bent. The next day, the magnetic tip broke off. Metal must be really thin on this. Disappointing."
2,Fairly chincy,"The base of the telescoping pointer is made of colored plastic. The fit is not great, so the whole thing wobbles a bit. You are almost certainly better served by spending another buck or two on a more well crafted pointer."
4,Cache finder,"I use this pointer to retrieve micro caches that are hard to reach otherwise. The magnetic tip is excellent for picking up the small containers.These caches are part of a high-tech hobby called Geocaching. By collecting longitude and latitude data from a web site [...] you use a mobile GPS unit or GPS capable smartphone, to travel to the coordinates then find the cache. Which are of course hidden, and that's were the magnetic pointer comes into play. And while you can only retrieve small caches with the magnetic tip (the caches come in all sizes) it's also good for probing into dark places. At 5-3/4 inches collapsed it is easy to keep the pointer in a small belt worn utility pouch (old walkman case)that I use to carry various geocaching tools. I have also found use for this pointer finding screws, nuts and bolts that fall into the grass when working on my car."
5,Easy and generous introduction to quantam physics,"I'm one of the lay person about physics, but I wanted to know what those aloof scientists are talking about, and this book gave me the exact idea. This book was very attractive, interesting, and informative. What I liked best is, this book told me how I can relate mind and substance."
1,"Not good for ""Non-scientists"".","Usually when I read a book, I get something out of it. I was left horribly unfulfilled after attempting to read this book. To begin with, the author uses too many big words and fancy terms. For example: ""peregrinations"". What ""non-scientist"" uses that word? And secondly, he may as well explain the material like this example I came up with: An object is red because red is the way it appears. Come on. At the risk of sounding really immature, I hate this book."
3,"A few good sections, but I was underwhelmed","This book had three good sections. One discussed how Zeno and other early philosophers looked at physical space as continuous. Another covered the historical period where Bohr, Einstein, and others were making radical new discoveries about how physical space really (or apparently) operated. Finally, there was some discussion about possible worlds. I'm sure any descent physics book would and should cover these areas, so I can't credit Wolf for doing anything special. Although Wolf did a pretty good job at explaining the wave-particle duality with reference to various famous experiments and their interpretations, the end of the book is just plain goofy with his amateurish speculation about physics and philosophy of mind."
1,Holding hands with the wolf-man!!,"If you are looking for any sort of objective presentation of Quantum Physics you've come to the wrong place. What you will find are cherry-picked Quantum-moments of lucidity, punctuated with the wolf man's brand of metaphysical interpretation. Unless you have a firm grasp of the concepts being presented you may find yourself easily lost in this very biased, "" Physics for Nonscientists. "" I give this one star for those poor flatlanders who may never understand the pyramid, as being more than triangle or a square respectively."
2,Spotty quality,"The cleaver is the only thing sharp in the kit we got. The. Sawblades we tried to use broke immediately, they are not good. The knife designs are good but the workmanship is sub par. With some hard work the blades may be shapened to the point where they are useable, but we haven't had time for that yet. Don't know if the knives will hold an edge yet. The knives and saw were useless for butchering a deer because they were too dull to be sharpened by the included steel and the sawblades broke in two."
4,Deuter Tibetan Singing Bowls,I enjoyed this album as a great followup to Deuter's earlier singing Tibetan bowls work. I always enjoy his music and have most of his albums over the past 20+ years. This album continues the high quality of spiritually uplifting music that has come to define Deuter.
5,One of the best meditation albums on the market!,"I have listened to all kinds of relaxing and meditative music over the years and happened to bump into this one by accident on Pandora.com Deuter has released many albums in the past and most of them are average in my book but this one is definitely impressive. Worth checking-out, especially if you're into Tibetan Bowls or Gong Music."
3,mildly disappointed,"Being a BIG Deuter fan, I was really looking forward to adding this CD to my collection. I have to say that I've rated all his other CDs in my music library five star, but this one and the first Nada Himalaya just weren't the sound I was hoping for."
2,Disappointing and more than a little grating,"I have been searching for more Tibetan music since Seven Metals and have been consistently led astray by choice snippets on other albums. Unfortunately, this album has an overly electronic sound to it and several edgy, irritating cuts. The first song is the best of the album! The rest are anything but ""meditative"".If you are looking for relaxing music, skip the electronics and listen to real temple bowls.Seven Metals Singing Bowls of Tibet"
3,Jeff and Dhani with Prince and others,absolutely cringeworthy-even more so than BAFTAs etc.only redeemed by Prince's performance in tribute to George Harrison.
1,technical accurate .. wasn't so useful to me,"Pocket streets is great for locating an address but doesn't help you find it, ie get there. It puts a star on the map but doesn't label all the surrounding streets. All streets are drwan as lines whether they are an alley or a freeway which makes it difficult to understand the geographic context of the address. You can highlight the subway stations but the names are not labelled. I use mapquest.com when using my PC so I really bought this (full price) for my Windows CE Pocket PC. The problem there is that the city databases are memory consuming and handle a limited area. I ended up scanning a few pages of a real map, that is more useful in navigating."
3,Still needs improving.,"A must have for road warriors, but still needs some improvement. The lag time in the GPS support makes the map following feature useless at speeds greater than 40MPH. In the 15 seconds it takes to refresh the position information, you'll have likely passed the exit. I have also found many major roads that had been completed over a year ago missing. I have also noticed that some points of interest are missing as well. This brings up another point, no update service, even for only a year, available. It does have road construction updates though.I still recommend it."
2,Not enough oomph,"You'd figure that Microsoft products, though not always greater than the competition's, would at least be on par.Hardily the case with S&T 2002.From reviews here, it's not a good product for camping and traveling. Well, it's not good for the city either. I live in a major metropolitan area. There's a major freeway in my city that's been here for 3 years, and still, it doesn't show up on the map.The big problem I have with this product is the lack of updating information. MS has the ability to check freeway condition and improvements. But instead of that feature, why not update finished freeways, new streets and past closuresI give it some credit. The mapping of several addresses at once was very on key. However, without the correct addresses, often times I've gone the wrong way for over 30 minutes. Planning a route is pretty easy, and it's nice to be able to save the routes seperately from within the program. But I'll have to take my chances with Rand McNally's this year."
1,Disappointed Mapping Product,"I doubt the above 2 reviewers are the actual users of MS S&T 2002 because none of them revealed the 15-second delay in updating the GPS position, the same unacceptable defect also found in S&T 2001. Driving 70 miles an hour on the interstate highway, you'll ALWAYS miss your exit with the belated 15-second GPS update. As a matter fact, there's very little difference in terms of features and performance between S&T 2001 and 2020. Contrary to Michael's cliam, S&T 2002's support for most GPS receivers (including Garmin and Magellan) is hopelessly zero. While all mapping software products contains errors, DeLorme Street Atlas USA is the best for your money. BTW, comparisoin with Rand McNally is unfair because its map was based an obsolete version supplied by ETAK. Nonetheless, Rand McNally StreetFinder and TripMaker are very friendly with all GPS receivers on the market."
3,"Fast, Easy to Use, Out-of-Date Data","Street and Trips 2002 has a lot of features that are very easy to use. Surprisingly, the response is extremely fast even when calculating long and/or complex routes. The ability to dynamically change a calculated route by dragging it to a different position is fantastic.There is, however, a major problem: the map data is out of date. Several spots near my home are almost two years out of date. Other spots I am familiar with in the state also suffer from incorrect data as well as some incorrect road naming.As for the comments about the GPS function, I don't use it and I would bet most users have no need for it. I do use GPS while on foot and know that the unit itself, a high end version, takes time to react depending upon the satellite visibility and surrounding terrain. Inside a fast moving car, a handheld GPS will not react instantly regardless of software. This is especially true in a city or town due to the numerous obstructions."
2,"Pocket Streets: Great Idea, Great Disappointment","I purchased Streets & Trips 2002 so that I could download state maps into a PDA. Installation and operation are familiar and straightforward. And maps download quickly to the PDA if you have a USB connection. But despite the fact that my PDA is equipped with a 128mB flash disk, Streets & Trips 2002 severely restricts the size of a downloaded MPS map file to a region that is about the size of Rhode Island, pretty much a joke out here in the Western US. The restriction seems more related to the size of the region rather than its density. Pocket Streets is useful for an urban area, but disappointing for a roadtrip."
2,Addresses are wrong,"I'm a distribution manager for a newspaper and I thought that this program would be handy. I used the feature that grabs addresses from a spreadsheet and imputs them into the map. When I double checked the locations, I noticed that more than half of them were wrong. They are often within a few blocks, but that makes it difficult when you are trying to plan a route. I must say though, that the route planner, when it works, is very nice."
1,Doesn't Work Very Well,"The very first route I planned with Microsoft Streets and Trips was from an address in Rochester, NY to an address in Sterling, Va. The software took me east through Syracuse, on a 446 mile, 7 hour and 48 minute route.I *knew* it was better to go directly south, so I coached the software by telling it to add stops in Corning, NY and Harrisburg, PA. Sure enough, now it found a 370 mile, 7 hour and 12 minute route.Further experiments show that the software's ""shortest"" and ""quickest"" routes are often longer and slower than the routes you can force it to plot by adding well-chosen stops. But of course if you know what route you want to force, you don't really need the software.I'm switching back to Delorme's Street Atlas. I've been using Version 6.0, where the interface is truly awful but at least you get the right routes. I'm hoping that in the current version 9.0, they've improved the interface and the underlying mapping algorithms are still as good as they've always been."
3,"Lots of Streets, Lots of False Info","Microsoft Streets and Trips 2002 is a great program with basically every single street in America. It is great for general mapping and finding out addresses and other stuff like that, but when compared to the accuracy of Microsoft Expedia Trip Planner 1998, the reliability begins to fail. Streets and Trips 2002 adds random ramps at interchanges, leaves out forest and picnic areas, and displays many roads that aren't paved as passable to standard vehicles. It's also odd to note that many freeways, which opened up in 2001, were not on Streets and Trips 2002, including a major part of the 210 Freeway extension in southern California around Interstate 15. That's just one example of how the program missed out on updates that should have taken place. I hope 2004 is better; otherwise, I'll just wait until 2005 for an upgrade."
2,Won't work on my handheld,"Even though the product information states that the MIPS processor is supported (but not tested), I could not get this program to load onto my Fujistu Pencentra 130 Handheld PC. I had to send it back to Delorme."
3,A little Outdated,I find streets and trip easy to use. I like the feature of mapping many different points at one time. However it is outdated. There are many addresses I cant find. It only updates the highway construction but not new local housing areas. That is a big hassle trying to find a cross street close enough to where I am looking for.
1,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2002,"Very dissappointed with the 2002 version. I have used S&T; 2000 for several years and loved it. It was accurate and provided off-line information about the points of interest (great on the road when internet is not available). This version assumes your always connected. The information button provides only address and phone #, no web address ... just a ""more online"" button. When I've clicked ""more online"" I've only received ""Page not available"" page. This version provides NO information about National Parks, Recreation Areas, etc. The 2000 version provided detailed descriptions, kid picks, web addresses, and a ton of other info. (without being on-line). I have also found numerous errors concerning the location of resturants and other ""points of interest"".I plan to re-install the 2000 version, return this version (if I can get my money back) and purchase different trip planning software."
1,terrible,"I bought this exact item from Forzieri directly and up to now, I rue the day. It came smelling of foul leather and had a tarnished brass lock. The lock lasted a few days. The strap is so thin, it'll cut your shoulders. The interior was almost glued to its folds. Incredibly, there was a tag that said it had passed through a quality control named Juno.Of course, I complained to Forzieri and they said I could return it, but I had already paid taxes on it and would have to pay post.I threw it away before the week passedI never ordered anything from Forzieri again."
4,a great coat,"I am so happy with my purchace of the opal creek Parka by Columbia. I got it in the color 'sail' in size large. It is very comfortable and roomy. I didn't want a really heavy coat, but a warm one. It is just perfect. I love the longer length which is really hard to find. I'm glad it has the double zipper so that you can open it a little from the bottom when sitting. I was thrilled with the quick delivery, even with free shipping I got it in 5 days! Thanks for a great product."
2,didn't work for me-- switched to Kitchenaid,"My results with this pan were not good. It had a chemical smell that continued past the first few attempts, and it tended to deform a lot in the oven despite having support from the sled. I didn't have those problems with the KitchenAid pan that I bought at the same time (with a larger muffin size), so later I bought the KitchenAid version of this one too, and I won't use the Roshco unless there's no alternative."
3,Not thrilled,"Muffins browned fine. Muffins released fine (with Pam). However, the sled allowed the pan to sag towards the center when heavy batter was in the cups. This resulted in odd-shaped, lopsided muffins. Not good."
2,Useless sled,"The sled for muffin pan doesn't support it. It sags in the middle, and half your cupcakes or muffins run to the sides, and end up lopsided. If you use this on a large baking sheet, it's fine though. But don't think it's non-stick, it's not, though you can usually pop them out by pressing on the bottom of each cup, try that with a metal pan."
2,strong plastic odor,"I am currently baking some muffins and am frightened by the plastic smell coming from my oven! This is the second time using them, I thought the smell would go away after the first use, but it didn't. I think I may be throwing these away :("
4,A period piece that was a pleasure to read,"A wonderful coming-of-age story and an real pleasure to read. Despite the simple story line of a single summer in the life of a young boy, the characters were well-drawn and complex, and presented a series of dilemmas that are universal despite the period piece."
5,Tears of joy and sadness,Many years have passed since I read a book that brought tears to my eyes. This is the one that did it!
2,Stick with the Sony Tutorials,"As a novice I found this book lacked clarity and focus. There is too much Video Editors jargon thrown in at times,some of the diagrams just do not get across the point trying to be made, and often the point is not clearly described in plain language. The simple method of doing something is sometimes overlooked in favour of a more complex selection.This book may be ok if you have quite a lot of previous experience of professional video editing on a PC, but I found the Sony ""Show me how Tutorials"" that come with the software to be far more concise, to the point and enable the work to be done. As a beginner this book has been of little use."
3,Not much help with Version 6.0,"I purchased Movie Studio + DVD 6.0 and needed help so I turned to this book which I purchased from Amazon.com. Well, I wish they would have indicated which version of Movie Studio this book was compiled on because 6.0 has many changes compared to 4.0. I did get some knowledge from the book, but not enough to justify the cost. I also think that if one did have 4.0, this book would be confusing to the novice."
2,Don't,"I am stepping through Vegas movie studio 6 and into full 7.I'm right at the stage where I need someone to lay it all out for me.And since I'm on a small island on Alaska I thought a book would do.One of the first screen images in this book had ""Vegas 4"" on the title bar. The procedures and references are not up to date.I'm a bit of a writer and I was actually afraid to read the book so as not to be brainwashed of what I've got already.So I didn't read it. I sent it back. I need clarity. I think I'm going to buySony's ""The Digital Video and Audio Production Book from Sony Media Software updated for Vegas 7.""It's on their site, couldn't find at Amazon.Amazon is great they even paid postage back.so the two stars are for amazon and for those who have just found a copy of V4 under that pile in the corner."
3,Basic Introduction to an earlier version.,"I found two main problems with this book. The main disadvantage is that the program has now been upgraded from version 5, as described in the book, to the new version 6. As a result there are major differences in the operations being described which would not be acceptable to a purchaser of the latest version. Secondly there is no index at the back of the book, making it very difficult to quickly find any particular item.I much preferred Vegas 6 Revealed by Doug Sahin which gives an excellent step by step approach. However, this latter book relates to the main Vegas program and therefore includes features which are not in the Vegas Movie Studio program. Furthermore it does not include the DVD Architect program which is covered in the Instant book, albeit an earlier version than the current one. To summarise, if you have the earlier version of Vegas Movie studio there is plenty in the Instant book for you to get started, even without an index."
4,Can't wait for an updated edition!,"I love the book, it covers much more than the sony manual. There are plenty of illastrations and step by step instructions. This book is geared to the novice user (Like me!) and it makes using such a powerful program less stressful."
1,worthless book,"Do not buy this book.1. No index, this is a ""how to "" book with NO INDEX?????2. No glassary. The author uses industry jargon to describe technical terms which is useless3. 25% of eaxh page is white space.4. In some key operations he leaves out major steps.In othe words....save your money."
5,Basic Research Methods for Librarians,Required for Grad class but would purchase even if it was not because it contains a lot of helpful information!
1,Dreadful,"Of course this book is required. . .which is why I got it in the first place. But does it have to be so poorly written. I have already taken and passed a course on research methods for a previous master's degree. But I needed a review as it had been over a decade. This book is not a review. It is poorly written and assumes a level of knowledge that is beyond most social scientists. For example, chapter 2 discusses the concept of validity for several pages but the authors have not talked about bias versus noise. Somehow I am supposed to know this already yet we are near the beginning of the book. Any professor looking at this book . . .please look elsewhere."
4,Great reference tool,Very helpful source of basic information on methods for researching reference questions - recommended for anyone working in a library.
3,n ice but not complete,"Although the dvd is worth viewing because of villella and McBride, the entire ballet is not preformed. The battle with the mouse king has been eliminated. Still the ballet is charming and so is Eddie albert."
5,Couldn't put it down,Grabs your attention from the first. Couldn't put it down and wanted to grab the next book as soon as was done.
2,Atkins diet in sheeps clothing,"I found this book very disappointing. I already own Dr. Atkins book and there isn't really any difference in the actual diet. The information on hormone therapy was interesting, but most of the information regarding recommended brands and doses of estrogen was available on the authors web site. If, like me, you have allergies to dairy products, eggs, or nuts, the companion book, ""Mini-Meal Cookbook"", is a waste of money."
3,Too technical,"I bought the book looking for a healthy diet plan to help me with the symptoms of menopause. I go more information than I really needed and too many percentages of what I should and should not eat. If your looking for a plan she does not give you one. There are some great, although, complicated recipes but the menu planning is all on your own."
2,Not exactly original thought,"Larrian Gillespie certainly speaks from personal experience, but this diet is not exactly orignal thought. Her 45-25-35 proportion for protein, fat, and carbohydrate is essentially the same as Barry Sear's Zone diet: 40-30-30. While labeling Sears diet as hard to follow and restrictive, her diet is virtually the same. I have successfully lived the Zone diet for three years, but was curious about anything new that might be in this book. I really thought there would be something new and there wasn't. If you want a very pro-HRT book, this is the one."
2,TOO TECHNICAL-UNORGANIZED,"Although there is a lot of information in this book, I found the actual DIET hard to put together. The doctor covers too much technical information which most of us do not need. There are a smattering of recipes, and some source lists, but nowhere is there a definitive few pages outlining the DIET! Read with a note pad handy to get the information you will need to use the diet."
2,Difficult to Follow,"I purchased this book after being thrown into surgical menopause in my late thirties. I found the book to be difficult to follow and it didn't seem to have any ""breakthrough"" information. I felt exhausted just reading the book. I didn't feel the layout was ""user-friendly"" and abandoned the plan shortly after beginning. I do believe the book contains good information. But, it was just hard to follow."
1,Duplicate of the Goddess Diet,"I ordered this and the Goddess Diet and they are essentially, the same book. The chapters are rearranged but it is the same ""summarized"" information in each book. Reviews tout Dr. Gillespie as having the ability to diseminate medical informaion in easy to understand terms. If you want the Cliff Notes of Low GI eating, then this is the book for you. Save your money and buy the Glycemic Revolution. This is the diet she espouses but she gives you minimal information-certainly not enough to follow a low GI plan successfully."
2,Interesting book,"This is an interesting book. The information seemed helpful, but one wonders if the diet really works. I tried it and had mixed results. This book may be of benefit for some readers, but not everyone fits the model that the advice is tailored to."
5,Another great book,Provides great info on what foods causes the tire around your waist. Pretty basic....easy to read.
5,The Medical Community Catches Up with Gillespie,"According to a study published last week in JAMA (July 2002), Progestins, not estrogen, causes breast cancer. Now where have I read that before? Oh yes.... chapter 6 in The Menopause Diet (on HRT)... a book that was published about three years before the new study on HRT. From the chapter on HRT: ""Not only do progestins counteract the positive effects of estrogen on your heart, but they increase the tension in the carotid artery, which can lead to strokes."" This is a small sample of the sound, and obviously ahead-of-its-time advice, that can be found in this entire book. I highly recommend that all women read this book and then talk to their doctors about their HRT options. If The Menopause Diet (and The Goddess Diet) is indicitive of the type of information Dr. Gillespie's providing to women when their own doctors are not, I look forward with great anticipation to her next book, ""You're Not Crazy... It's Your Hormones!Cathi"
2,The Menopuase Diet,"I bought this book after reading the fine reviews.If I were a doctor or had lots of time to figure out the 45%,--,-- rule for everything I put in their mouth....well I guess it would work. For me? I have a schedule that's too full now, I need helpful menus, does and don'ts, and a simple way to calculate what I eat. Sorry, this one didn't do it for me."
1,Not happy,Product in very poor shape. Missing a very important part. Returned. Not new as described . Won't order from this company again.
1,Piece of Junk,This boombox is a piece of junk. I had to return it because the cassette tape player made so much noise that I couldn't even hear the tape playing. The top to the CD player wouldn't open very easily and the whole thing just seemed like it was made really cheaply. Many of the buttons on the front didn't even line up with the holes they were in. I was also surprised on how big it was. I didn't think it would take up that much room. I would not recommend buying this boom box at all.
4,"Great read, but hard to review without major spoilers","If you've read any other reviews here, you've already had the book spoiled in several major ways. That's unfortunate, since if you're a fan of any of the branches of speculative fiction, you'll probably be asking yourself ""what genre fits this book?""Along with that question, you'll probably be asking ""Exactly what's going on here?"" Despite that question being central to the reading experience, this novel does reread well, too. However, any spoilers at all will ruin the first time for you. So, I'll leave it as simply a very highly recommended novel.This is Brust at his absolute best. I think this is likely his best novel ever. It has a gritty noirish flavor not unlike some of Zelazny's best fiction (the good stuff, not Amber).BTW, I do think he uses the adjective ""natty"" far too often in this novel."
4,"A vampire book that never uses the word ""vampire""","This book is about a vampire but it never once uses the word ""vampire"". It also never uses the word ""blood"" except in a couple of places related to normal human violence. This is a clever detour from the typical vampire genre.You meet a character you're pretty sure is a werewolf, but it never uses that word. I really enjoyed reading this book, which came out long before the new vampire craze."
5,One of the better vampire books,"Drowning in the flood of pathetic vampire romance that gluts the market these days, it's sometimes necessary to return to some of the older, and far better, vampire fiction out there. Agyar is an excellent read and shows that the brilliant Steven Brust has a far better grasp on portraying the undead than the current crop of romance novelists looking to cash in on the supernatural trend will ever have. Do yourself a favor. Put down Twilight and the Anita Blake books. Sink your teeth into this instead."
5,A typically GREAT Brust book!,"This book is excellent! Brust evokes strong feelings using a minimum of words. The spare style throughout the story is well-done, hinting at many dark and dangerous things, yet never quite coming out and saying what's going on. A fine vampire novel, definately worth reading."
5,One of the best Vampire Stories ever written,"Steven Brust has long been a favourite of mine, and if you read Agyar, you will understand why. I believe that there are very few vampire stories that are truly worth reading, perhaps it is something about the very nature of vampires that makes them so difficult to handle. However, John Agyar, even as a killer, comes across as a very well- rounded character who evokes the reader's sympathy. The story revolves around Agyar's fight to free himself from the machinations of his mistress, Laura, and his growing love for a talented young dancer named Susan. The ending, while not entirely completely rosy, is none the less very satisfying. A much- recommended read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A fairly mundane vampire tale, as one of these supernaturally afflicted types meanders his way around an American university town, trying to work out what to do, as do other characters in the book, whether academic types, or other denizens.Some of the law enforcement types do become involved when death turns up."
2,ho hum,"Stephen Brust is a decent guy, but I have yet to read a book of his that I like. This book's only advantage is that it is welcome relief to Anne Rice drivel, but besides that there's nothing there.The main character is an annoying pain, while the rest of the characters are stupid and ignorant. It is an interesting experiment but there's nothing to recommend it over a thousand other vampire books."
5,Wonderful,"He continues going into the human condition and the mind, why we do the things we do why don't we change it. Gets you to think about your own human condition, very good read if you're inquiring about these things."
4,Does what it is supposed to,Installed it myself in my home garage. Fits together ok. Takes a little time to get it lined up to fit as well as it can. Had to go to the hardware store to buy a couple of bolts to mount the rear hangers. Overall does what it needs to do and allows any V8 exhaust to bolt up. Installed on a 2000 Mustang with V6 auto trans. Adapted to a stock 2000 V8 exhaust for a good mellow sound. I did not have it welded as some others have as my clamps have stayed tight.
3,Can be useful if supplemented with other resources...,"It is naive to think one educational resource is a sufficient precondition for passing the Sun Java2 programmer exam. The exam is not easy and the questions do require a thorough understanding of CoreJava2 and OOP. That being said, the book is a decent supplement to other online resoures such as Sun's Java tutorial and the core Java APIs. I would also investigate the web sites for the intro programming classes at top-tier universities in the US; I have discovered good information this way for Java and other issues of interest to software engineers. As other reviewers have pointed out the book has mistakes in the Q&A sections and Jaworski's web site fails to deliver on the book's promises of errata and additional test taking material [read: the questions on the cdrom and web site are the basically same as those in the book!]. I haven't taken the Developer and Architect exams yet, so my review must end here. Good luck with the exam(s) everyone!"
2,Errors deadly in this context,"This book would have benefitted from a more thorough technical review. It's one thing to have typographical errors in a how-to book, but in this type of book it wastes the reader's valuable time. I'm glad I kept my receipt--this one is going back to the shelf."
1,"Many mistakes, no support",I have to agree with many of the reviewers. There are a lot of mistakes in this book and many of them are SERIOUSLY misleading. The support for this book is non-existant. There are no corrections posted on the website (as advertised) and there is no 'forum' for discussion (also advertised). My emails to the author have gone unanswered. Next time I'll read the reviews here first :(
2,Poorly Done,"1. I found many errors and typos in the book.2. It failed to even explain simple concepts like hexadecimal and octal conversion.3. It failed to adequately explain inner classes.4. The test engine would not install on my NT machine.5. Since the test engine failed to install, I used the engine available from the website. The questions seem to repeat.6. I consistently scored in the high 80s and low 90s (percentage) on the practice exams, but failed the official certification. Hence, I find the test engine is useful but not realistic.My summation: do not purchase this book. It helps, but it is not a one stop solution to your test preparation needs (despite its billing). I will retake the exam in 2-3 weeks, and I will find other preparation material.To Jaworski: I suggest you spend more time revising your next version."
3,average!,The book is full of typos and mistakes that drive you crazy. The practice questions are not even close to real exam questions.
2,Desperately seeking errata sheet,"Loaded with content and typographical errors (and without an erratta sheet), this book is a real waste of time. The latter two thirds of the book are particularly bad. Try The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide by Roberts, et.al from Sybex instead. It's much, much better than this expensive door-stop."
2,Good text but too many mistakes,"It is unfortunate. This book could be one of the best. It certainly tries to give the right amount of information at the right level and in many ways it succeeds. The bad news is that it is riddled with errors. Especially galling is that most of the errors are in the practice exam and review questions at the end of each chapter. In some cases they are totally wrong and in other cases they interchange answers. Another problem is that the book promises a forum on page 5 and posting of corrections on the web site. It does not exist, the site has only practice exams and they fail to load. Not very encouragning for a book that purports to show you how to program in Java. The author ignores all email."
3,A good companion but not highly recommed.,This book can be used as a supplement for the exam with other guides like simon heller but cannot be a substitute for it.Relying on this book for your exam preperation is not recommended.It may have a lot of questions but beware many of them have errors.Also the CD is absolutely not useful as the test is available online at jaworski.com
3,a good book for now.,"I do not really accept the views other people have about this book, especially those who rated the book with 1 or 2 stars. I am still preparing for the java 2 exam and i think the book is allright.I have some experience with java programming and i think the kind of mistakes i found in the book are easy to correct. I have not seen any serious mistake yet. I think we really need to appreciate Mr. Jaworski for a good job done.It is hard to find a mistake free book that could take you through the certification exams.But then,if the mistakes ain't that too bad, why not go for the book? The only thing i'll like to criticise about the book is the sample questions.They look too easy and i don't really feel comfortable with that.I doubt if the real test is that simple.For this reason i'll like somebody out there who has done the test to tell me how it really feels. Thank yo'll for reading my view.I'll get back to you guys after taking the test."
2,Probably could be better,"Developer exam is not really covered, there are also several typos and mistakes (probably present in other hastily made Java certification books). Wide almost unused page pargin is really annoying, so many trees would be cut for the author and publishers to make money. Programmer exam topics probably could be covered somewhat better. But the book has the only coverage available today on Architect exam, even if there are probably better generic books available on the topics."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Explanations could be more thorough. Each page is 40% margin. The most difficult exam (Developer), is covered in 2 chapters. One of those simply restates the instructions that come with the assignment and briefly restates the assignment the author received. The other chapter on the Developer exam is a short chapter on how to answer the follow-up exam questions. The sample question in the Programmer exam chapters are very easy compared to the actual exam. Many topics are covered by giving the reader a brief explanation and a list of other resources that explain the details."
2,Outdated Programmer Cert Section,"Used this book exclusively to study for the J2CP test. The example questions were outdated and nowhere near the level of complexity found on the actual test. I passed, but not because of this book (5+ yrs experience w/ Java).The developer certification section was short on content. Now that Sun has beefed up the Architect exam, I wouldn't trust the Architect section in this book.The book is good at giving you a solid understanding of the Java language basics. However, the purpose of buying a book like this is to prepare for and pass the certification tests, and there is no hope for someone with little experience to pass any of the exams using this book."
3,Java 2 Certification,"I started out with this book. Good follow-on for the architecture exam as it seems the only publication which has material on that subject. However, after taking and passing the programmer certification, I would recomend the Java 2 Exam Cram by Bill Brogden. It is packed with concise information and will get you there much quicker."
2,Errors cost me critical points on the exam,"I just failed the exam by a small margin, and I know I missed at least 1 question because of errors in this book. This book doesn't even accurately list all the Java reserved words, which I discovered after reviewing Brogden's Exam Cram book this morning. For instance, Jaworski does not list ""true"" and ""false"" as reserved words, yet they apparently are (and were on my exam).Jaworski, take your book off the market or publish a full errata sheet. You should refund the cost of my book."
1,Cover a small part of the Architecture Exam,This book officially cover the first step of the Architect Certification: the first exam. But in fact the book cover just a quarter of the exam. The author is not supporting his book anymore.A lot of copy past was done in this book. Same things can be repeted more than 3 times! On the CD-ROM a test engine is provided with no more questions that those listed at the end of each chapter in the book! Useless in anyway for the Architect Exam.
1,"A shoddy job, full of errors","Others have pointed out the egregious number of errors in this shoddily produced book.I would just like to add that the errors are not all trivial typos, as some reviewers have asserted.Basic points are omitted, for example the scoping of an ELSE in nested IF's, a standard pitfall of syntax, is nowhere discussed.Worse, some subtler points are completely fluffed. For example, the answer to question 12 of Chapter 6 is exactly flat wrong: static inner classes *can* be instantiated. It looks as if the author has simply misunderstood what the static modifier means when used with inner classes, has explained them vaguely, and then failed his own exam.Fellow student, your money is better spent elsewhere. I just wrote this one off as a loss, and taking the recommendation of a well-informed friend in the computer-book business, have bought Simon Roberts et al instead, which already looks a lot better.And shame on New Riders for publishing this sloppy, shoddy book."
1,Falls short for Java Architect exam,"This is the only book I found for the Certified Java Architect exam. After taking and failing the test twice, I can safely say that this book misses many points, and is downright misleading on others. Many topics appearing on the exam were NOT covered by this book. The test simulation is just a re-hash of the questions in the book, and some of the answers are incorrect. This book gives you information on the test - but by itself is not enough to pass. IMHO, that makes it just about worthless."
3,Good book but not enough to get you through,"After having taken the test and passed on the first try, i would like to say that this book provides pretty good information about some details of java programming that you might normally overlook or discount. Some really interesting insights into the language is revealed. The review questions are pretty good as well and can give you a fair idea of the expected questions. However, i would say to anyone who is interested in taking the test seriously...get hold of the java language specifications book. Nothing beats it...coz it is straight out of the horses mouth and youll find a lot of info there that could be relevant to the test. Another thing!! Practise!!! Try out some small programs on your own to get a fair idea of how java works..especially for the AWT and event handling classes..Once done refer to this book and you find it more promising!!"
1,"TRAINING guide, not STUDY guide","This book provides a broad overview of Java. It lacks detail and no way provides ALL the information needed to ""cram"" for the exam. It relies upon referencing the reader to external resources regularly. As its copyright date is 7/99, it is not up to date with the more code based exam that began 10/2000. (as opposed to the previous exam that had more definitions)."
1,"This books is very bad, do not buy it.","This book is atrocious. It is very expensive and is completely valueless for passing the exam. It provides no real information, rather it is an endless checklist of things that you need to know to pass the exam. Sun provides this for free in their test objectives list. The mock exam is exactly that, a mockery of an exam. The test engine barely works (I had to modify several files to get it to work) and the questions are poorly phrased and confusing. I would strongly advice anyone who wants to pass the test to save their money and purchase another book instead...."
1,"Riddled with errors, typos, and omissions","So far I have read 6 chapters of Part I. There is a typo or an outright mistake on nearly every page. Semantics of the language are described either incorrectly or in terms too vague to even be wrong. Whoever typeset the thing put ""fi"" and ""fl"" ligatures in the monospaced code typeface, and after about 100 pages forgot to indicate syntactic metavariables with italics. When I read others' reviews saying that the real exam questions are much harder than those in this book, and then I find that the ones in the book actually have incorrect answers given in some cases, I lose all faith in the rest. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Waste of money and time,"I baught the book to prepare for the exam, I recognized that I wasted my time and money after I failed the exam. It has nothing to do with the exam. Bad book"
4,I would voute for this book.,"The book is not so much bad as someone noted. I find two typos, but this should concentrate the reader on the material. I think new guys can't easily pass the Java Sertificate Exam. and they really should look for another book. The rest of the success is dependent on the reader's Java background and experience. And this book covers exactly what is necessary for the exam."
3,Okay but not great,"This book is adequate as a supplement as you prepare for the exam , but it is not exceptional. There were a couple questionable topics, in particular, be cautious of the explanation it gives of polymorphism. The coverage of the Developer exam is very brief, but if you are buying the book only to pass the programmer exam, you should probably do fine. Personally, I found The Complete Java 2 Certificaion Study Guide to be clearer and more effective."
2,Too many error and too thin in some areas,"I passed my exam, but by the narrowest margin possible and with little help from this book.The errors in the book were inexcusable, and cost me at least one question on the exam. It also didn't cover some topics as well as they should have been. There were only a couple of paragraphs on inner classes in the book, yet they appreared in about 10 of the 60 questions!There must be other books on the markey that are better... or at least written by someone who has taken the exam before!"
2,"Good writing, but lack of attention to detail","I found the style readable, but there are many errors. Also, the CD programs only parrot what is already in the book, and some of the questions have errors - un acceptable in a book of this type. Whats worse, the author seems not to care - did not responed to my e-mails. Nice cover."
3,serves one purpose only,"Spoiler Alert!!!!!It should be read, because it continues the plot between ""Gamma Mission"" series and Unity, but dang if it didn't bore me to tears. I love the character Jake, but couldn't he have bumped into Opaka earlier and had an adventure on her planet or whatever? That way, the author wouldn't have had to spend almost half the book describing some ridiculously weird characters...even then i just couldn't really picture a talking dog and a walking plant fungus thingy:-) We'll probably never read about these ""things"" again(hopefully), but I wanted to read more about these people who are connected to the Bajoran Prophets. I think you get to read a whole chapter about them, and that's it. Oh well, It had some brief, interesting, moments. I really hope they give Jake some better things to do in the future."
4,Well written but slowed by revelation in last book.,"I loved S.D Perry's writing style, and all the great characters and the marvelous plot. The ONLY ONLY ONLY problem with this book came in the conclusion of the last book. If they hadn't allowed us to know that Jake found Kai Opaka in the end of the last book, then Rising Son would have been a much more enjoyable book. Because I knew how it ended, that Jake was found and he brought back Kai Opaka, I found that I read the book, not for the story, but just to find out how he found Opaka. I had to get through 3/4 or more of the book before that even happened!Just an editing glich and a personal opinion. Otherwise, great job S.D.! I look forward to Unity.R"
5,One of the Best,"I have never been a big Jake fan but after reading this book I understand him a lot better. This is one of the best DS9s. I read the series backwards so I already knew he would find Opaka, not bring back what's his name (who I never really liked), and what the deal was with Wex. However even knowing this didn't decrease my enjoyment. All of the characters became a family and I hated that the book had to end."
4,Here it is,"The long awaited ""Jake"" novel is finally here. We finally get to learn to what happened to Jake's ill-fated journey into the wormhole all the way back in ""Avatar, Book 2"".This book is full of likeable new characters, the re-emergance of the long missing Kai Opaka, and answers to previously unanswered questions that have dominated this latest ""season"" of DS9. When it's not answering questions about prophecies, there is enough action and suprises to keep you wanting more.The best part of ""Rising Son"", however, is that Jake finally gets some real character development. In the show, his development was usually second to that of his dad, which considering the nature of his destiny is understandable. However, Jake is now given an opportunity for some serious sef-evaluation and growth.All in all, ""Rising Son"" is a worthy addition to the series, and leaves me excited for the new hardcover, ""Unity""."
4,interesting read,"It is fair to note that I am not posting spoilers in this review--enough people have done that in other reviews. If you want to know what happens, you are hopefully curious enough to read it! I was.I always enjoyed DS Nine episodes that developed Jake's character. This book didn't disappoint me. However, I think that it may be rather difficult for some people to appreciate; and I was disappointed at the end until I learned to have a more open mind. Of course, that disappointment is part of personally identifying with the emotions that Jake experienced at that point in the story... It is something I am supposed to feel as part of the reading process. A truly good book would not spare me that emotional experience."
2,Dreadful...,I just had a chance to try this software and it was awful. The program kept on freezing. Should have bought encarta instead. This program doesn't really have any detailed information. Most of them are short and without any sort of pictures....
3,Useful to Higer education students,Single disc encyclopedia is good forstudents.Not worth for the money.Try to buy 3CD pack encyclopedia.
4,Inspects well,Being a Gear Head kind of guy this is a godsend type of tool! Great for getting to see stuff behind cabinets too! Good little square mirror tool I keep you close in a drawer so I can always use you one day more....
3,Just okay,"The mirror arrived as promised and on time. The quality of the inspection mirror was questionable. The glass mirror is not secured tight and rattles around. It works, just not built the best. If you need one this size and price it is okay but there are much better quality items out there."
1,Beware: It's about society; not art,"From the standpoint of a study of art, this book is not worth having (even if it's at a good price) in spite of the rarely-often reproduced images. The images are poor. If they had been in color, they would have been worth the publisher's price. This book is not about painting, but rather about the content of paintings. I would rather have had half the paintings reproduced in color and a tenth the commentry edited out. The same point could have been made if a lot of Victorian pornography had been substituted. But the rarity of the chosen works gives them some value as an art study. Just separate the cultural comment (whatever your personal opinion) from the art work if you can."
5,great,"a beautiful book I have two copies,You people should not require me to use a certain number of words, it just doesnt make sense. I only wanted to say it is good."
3,Too little Horowitz.,"I prefer Horowitz playing alone rather than with a symphony. There was too little of him alone and too little Chopin. I was drawn in by the word 'magic' and did not review what was on it enough. It's certainly all right, but I much prefer other recordings of his.Tip: review carefully what you're buying.Delivery was a couple days later than told, but that wasn't a deal breaker."
2,Obviously not written by Matt Groening!,"What upset me about this book was that it's listed as being written by Matt Groening. This is not the case. It's introduction is written by him, but the scripts were done by Eric Rogers, who is one of the staff writers for the TV series (info from [the web site]).The writing seems a little dumbed-down at times, and it makes me wonder if it was written for a younger audience (pre-18) than the audience of the TV series. The exception would be the fourth story which is a parody of Apocalypse Now featuring Zap Branagan.The colors are vibrant, and almost has the appearance of a photo book.The art is spot on for the most part.In the end, though, you have to look at it like this: here are four so-so episodes of a series that has unfortunately seem to have met its end, so fans looking for more material should pick it up.Conclusion: Not horrible, but ultimately forgettable."
2,Futurama face without the personality,"The only way this comic would be tolerable is if you enjoyed the show and can actually visualize the action according to the physics, action, and fun of the original cartoon. Even Futurama fans may find this comic a tough pill to swallow for their Futurama fix.Though the art is solid and familiar, the writing and stories are ridiculously sub-par. i would much rather watch the worst Futurama episodes over again than read any of the comics in this trade paperback.The writers occasionally attempt to interject some of the ongoing gags to make it feel like Futurama. Like everyone's disdain for Zoidberg. Common exclamatory phrases (Sweet Zombie Jesus!) and the like. But take all those out, and you just have stories that made me realize that they CAN make bad Futurama stories."
3,"Good Art, Lame Writing","As a fan of the TV show, Futurama, I picked up this comic to get a little more of that Futurama fix. I was really let down by the comic though. First, I want to say that the art is excellent in this comic and the artists have really captured the feel of the Futurama world. Unfortunately the stories are deadly boring. It seems like they passed off the writing to the writers who were rejected from the show. There is absolutely nothing funny about the stories, and they hardly make any sense. The flow of the stories is like watching someone pouring lumpy gravy. I can't imagine anyone enjoying what passes for comedy in this comic. If you really must have this for the artwork, then it's OK. Just don't bother reading it. For the fans of Futurama, just stick with the DVDs of the TV show and you won't be disappointed."
3,For futurama fans and people like me.,"This is a collection of a few futurama comics. If you miss thebest TV show about life the year 3001 ever made, you shouldbuy it. But that most probably also means that you are a nerd.===== FUTURAMA, AS-SEEN-ON-TV ===="
2,better than the series,"The Simpsons comics expand the world of ""The Simpsons,"" expanding on the lives of minor characters and forging new relationships (Bart with Professor Frink, for instance, or Kang the Alien with Apu). The ""Futurama"" comic stories, however, are almost identical to the tv series, with the same boring adventures of the same five characters. Not much wit or ingenuity here."
5,Great for rest - and LABOR!!,"I've had this set for several years and really enjoy them. Like most people I use the delta cd most often. When I was in labor with my son, I played the CD in the delivery room and barely woke up with contractions I was so relaxed. I had lots of energy to push when the time came. With this baby, I'll have to take headphones - the staff finally had to turn it off because it was making them sleepy last time. Highly recommend. Also, I originally bought it after my neurologist told me that you have to have delta level sleep in order for your brain to make enough of the proper chemical to aid in soft tissue repair (tendons, ligaments...). I must say that it seems that it really helped with progressing my physical therapy."
5,"Skeptical at first, but totally love them","I particularly love the Alpha and Theta CDs... really great ambient music/sounds and they totally work for me. The first track on the Delta CD is relaxing (light delta waves), but the second track has some really low tones that I find kinda creepy, actually, so I didn't have much luck using this in falling asleep. However, Jeffrey Thompson has so many CDs available, that you can pretty much choose music and sounds that work best for you. I like his ""Natural Music for Sleep"" delta CD (doesn't have those low tones).I wanted to mention that the Alpha-Theta CD in this set is different from the other CDs in that it's pretty much just nature sounds with no music (mostly crickets, birds, rain, etc.) I prefer the ambient stuff personally.I also bought his Awakened Mind 2.0 CD and LOVE it."
5,Fantastic,The cds work perfectly.They are clear and easy to hear.I really enjoy listening to these cds.They are very relaxing and help me meditate
5,I've had great success with these CDs,"I had been reading books on self-hynpnosis, NLP, Silva mind control, etc. for close to a year, but had difficulty dropping myself into a trance state. These CDs were the answer! I have no trouble slipping into a mindful state when I play these. I use the alpha CD when I want to do affirmation work, and the theta CD when I want to do visualizations. When I need a combination of the two, I use the alpha-theta CD. The delta CD is supposed to provide deep relaxation and help you drift off to sleep, but so far I haven't had much luck with it. Doesn't matter though--for me, the other three CDs are more than worth the price. For full effect, you need to listen through headphones.I use these CDs in conjunction with the book ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"" by Joseph Murphy--between the two, I have really been able to unlock the underlying power of my subconscious. I highly recommend the CDs, and the book!"
2,Disappointed,"This item was warped when I received it. I even ""straightened"" it a couple of times with weights because I didn't want the expense of returning it. Didn't work. I use it, just annoyed that it's not what I expected."
4,Excellent Thought of MacroEcon.,Its an well-put together of what you really need to know of MacroEcon. and and helps really clarify if Econ. is not a dismal after all?
3,fan is problem,"This is one of the best laptops I've had....BUT...the fan can drive you crazy! I cannot take this to the library because people might think there's a race car in the computer - that's what it sounds like and it's constant and annoying! Sony says on their support site that the issue is ""under investigation"" so I didn't want to wait for the results and returned this beauty..."
1,Terrible Experience,"Have owned laptop a little over 2 years. It has been back to Sony twice and has finally crashed with its third bad motherboard. No help from Sony and Sony Customer Satisfaction has no interest in keeping me as a customer or resolving defective motheboard issue. I buy several computers each year for business and will no longer consider a Sony product. they are great when they operate properly, but i'm afraid that is a challenge for this product."
3,Fan Noise,"Many positives have been said about this computer and I agree it has many positives, BUT a big negative can bring its whole appeal down: the fan is tooo noisy and it is operating most of the time even when set to ""Level 1 (quiet)"". Stores are very noisy and thus you cannot detect the noise then, but wait until you are at home or the office and then the noise will drive you nuts. I have owned laptops from Gateway (3), HP (4), Dell and Apple and I had never experienced levels of noise that even get close to this VAIO."
5,Gotta love it!,"I got my VAIO s260 stolen, so I ended up buying the s360 as a replacement because I liked this series so much. The only differnece I can see is the 80Gig upgrade, which is more than enough. I love the design for this laptop. The keyboards are perfect size, and is light enough for me to carry to class everyday without breaking my shoulder. It goes great with the Roadwired Advanced case."
2,don't buy this nootbook,"I read the comment about the fan noise this computer has, but I didn't care and bought this computer anyway. I just got this laptop today and the first thing I noticed is how ridiculously loud the fan is. I have a Dell laptop, but I can't hear the fan on my Dell's even when I press my ear against it. I called Sony's Service Center, they told me that alot of customers have called them complaining about the fan problem and a investigation is underway, but I am so pissed off right now because this product has a blatantly defective fan and Sony has failed to pull it out of the market.Honestly, the fan makes so MUCH noise that this computer is not even worth buying."
1,Don't Buy..Sony doesn't support customer,"I just bought this laptop in june. In just five days after loading software and briefly using it the screen went bad. So I called sony and explained the problem and the man at sony said it is a hardware problem and he would send a box to return it in for repair.I returned it in his box and waited. After not hearing anything I called sony to find out the status. He said the LCD inside the computer was broken and then he said it would cost me $783.00 to have it fixed. I explained to him about how careful I had handled it and it was either a manufacture flaw or either Best Buy and poor handling by them.I explained to him that after paying $2,400 with extended warranty I was extra careful.He kept on pointing the finger at me.So the bottom line is I have to pay $783.00 for poor workmanship by sony. I will never buy anything with a higher price tag from sony or Best Buy again as they do not value customers and take care of them."
5,Necessary maintainance item for longer enjoyment of product,"We love the Plantronics headset, but the ear piece WILL eventually wear out and begin to hurt your ear. I highly recommend have enough spares that you can extend the useful life of your unit. The 3 pack of spares was a good idea as opposed to buying them one at a time."
3,just earloops,"just earloops for a plantronics CS50 headset, not that confy I would recommend an over the head approach when using the CS50."
4,Plantronics Spare Earloops,I bought these beacuse my older ones were worned out. I like it. Not much to say about the product. good brand good product but very expensive for my taste
2,not a fan,"I thought I would like these more than the over the head band, but I was wrong. The band is comfortable."
1,like a tin,"this flanger is kind of crappy. Yes, it has lots of choise, but they all sound like tint or steel and the wave does not last long. And its super heavy as a stomp box."
1,Underwhelmed,"This being a Line 6 product, I was expecting the best product out there, however in my experience this is the worst flanger I have heard. In fact, I sent it back. All of the flanger models sound like they pass through 0, and the entire effect sounds 'canned' somehow."
3,Wordy.,"A good book, but I don't care for the format. Relies more on lengthy textual descriptions than on pictures. No matwork included."
1,Lasted 4 months,Bought to replace same model purchased 5 years ago that heating element burned out on. New one lasted 4 months. Switching to Mr. Coffee.
1,"Bad, Bad, Worse than Bad",Does anyone that owns this product have a problem with pouring from the pot? Either the water going in or the coffee coming out? I end up with a mess all over the counter; I have to keep a dish towel right there for quick clean ups. It is absolutely ridiculous! A complete mess. Whoever heard of a coffee pot that will not pour! I am taking this product back to the store and NEVER buying a Black & Decker product again!
2,Not Good,"Very poorly designed. The pieces inside where the basket for the coffee goes do not fit together easily or well. Tricky, not ergonomic, cheaply made.Lid to pot is not removable, making cleaning less easy. Doesn't pour very easily.My unit decided to stop keeping correct time after one week so the programming feature is now useless to me.Not a good coffee maker for the price, especially since it's only a 10 cup.Don't buy this unit, it's cheap, but it shows."
5,Perfectly Satisfied,"For a relatively inexpensive coffeemaker, this one served its purpose! The basket fit tight, never overflowed and worked perfectly. I had mine for 10 years -- a good run for his coffee maker."
1,It only lasted 5 weeks!,"This coffeemaker only lived for 5 weeks! I purchased it in mid-August and by mid-September it would no longer work. The lights come on but it won't heat water.Buy it if only you want a ""disposble"" coffeemaker."
1,lasted all of 8 months!,"I paid about 30 dollars for this coffee maker, should have known.It lasted almost 8 months, then it lost a hose out of the ""pump""(it actually melted) and it quickly and messily died.Black and Decker has not yet responded to my email. I am very disappointed."
1,Piece of junk.,"This is the worst, cheapest piece of crap ""coffee maker"" I have ever owned. Received it for a gift this Christmas and hopefully can take it back. Water runs all over the place down the sides when brewing. Took forever to brew and if you lift the lid to look you could get squirted in the face with scalding hot water. It shoots right up from the back and if the lid isn't down, WATCH OUT. Worst design ever.I would give it ZERO stars!!!!"
3,The coffee's not hot enough...,"My previous mr. Coffee developed mold inside the water reservoir, so I threw it out. This coffee maker was reasonably priced, small enough for my limited counterspace, and seemed simple to operate. All of these things are true.However, the temperature of the coffee when it is brewed is not hot enough for me, and the hotplate does NOT keep it hot. I realize this is a ""personal problem"" ~LOL!~ but I find myself doing a 30-sec microwave on each cup. I do add milk to my coffee.I also am unable to remove the carafe lid - so how do I wash the carafe in the dishwasher (or even easily by hand)? Small plastic nubs, indeed!I see the problem with the filter cone, but so far have not had an issue."
3,Makes good coffee but...,"I like the coffee it makes but the lid on the carafe doesn't come off... I had to cut itty bitty notches into the lid so it pops on and off easy.If that was not an issue, I would have given it 4 to 5 stars..."
2,"If you like weak coffee, this is your machine.","Our coffee maker recently died on us, so I picked this one up hoping it would do the trick. It works fine, I suppose, and it's quite cute, but unless you plan to use twice the coffee you normally do, you're in store for a weak cup of java. This thing brews coffee so quickly that the water hardly has any contact with the grounds. As a result, even with increased coffee grounds added, the best you're likely to get is a caramel colored coffee. If you like robust coffee, stay away from this thing, but if you are into weak coffee that is done in a flash, this might be just the coffee maker for you."
1,Poor quality control,I bought this coffee machine earlier in the fall and it lasted about 8-9 weeks before it just wouldn't work one morning. I returned it for another machine and that machine wouldn't work from the very start. I returned it and bought a different brand. Six mornings without coffee and a sick small child were a very bad combination!
1,Dangerous design,"There is one single lid to the top of this coffee maker, and the lid is lifted to put in and remove the coffee filter, as well as to pour in water. Do you think the coffee is looking too strong? Do you quickly want to add a half cup of water to the reservoir? Lift the lid, and the boiling water, which comes out of a little arm attached to the bottom of the lid, shoots out at you. Do you want to remove the coffee filter right away when the coffee is done? Lift the lid again and the residue steam scalds your hands. Everything, including the boiling water spout is under the same lid. This is not designed safely."
1,wrong case,Description says case will fit a Blackberry 8700c. The case I received was much too small and does not work for this model.
4,kewl color,"Kewl color, a little bigger than I expected, super light wight. the straps are really wide but this make them really comfortable on shoulders and chest. maybe not worth 30$ but worth about 20$-$25"
4,An excellent companion to the text.,The Teacher's Answer Key to Harvey's Elementary Grammar and Composition is an excellent support for the text. Answers are well set out and easily understood.
2,Not like the picture,"What's that sleek, metal rod hanging off the string in the picture? I wouldn't know, but because mine came instead with a chintzy little plastic bead that barely weighs enough to pull the string through the clarinet. The cloth is cheap and non-absorbent, and edges are already all frayed. Does the job, but barely."
3,Towels,"The small towel says, ""for the little giants fan"". I was under the assumption it was a dish towel. It's for babies I guess. Still good for grilling i suppose. The larger towel is standard size, pretty thin material but good for tailgaiting."
1,Third one and counting...,"Unfortunately, Earthlink has saddled me with a succession of these modems. I would estimate average life expectancy to be under one year. What's worse is the fact that they die a slow, intermittent death. It's just random enough to make you change all the cables, perform myriad troubleshooting routines, call customer service... and then resign yourself to the fact that it has yet again croaked. Run away. Run away quickly."
2,still working on it...,straight out of the box and connected to phone line & computer/great.sync with computer/cool. Connecting to Internet/not so good...yetAT&T; in area not so good; blaming problem on modem...still working with AT&T; customer service.
5,Great value,I was buying my white pepper from a gourmet store (W&S) and 6 ounces cost $12. This pepper is just as good at a fraction of the price.
3,"Works, sort of ...","Fast shipping! This product sort of works. I'd been having ants in my kitchen and I didn't want to use anything around food that would be toxic so I order this product. I sprayed it on the ants and it did kill them but it took a little longer than traditional bug spray. The ants would still be alive for a few minutes after spraying them with this so the ants would crawl around and keeping coming until the product kicked in. The smell is pleasant and it doesn't leave a greasy sticky mess. I haven't tried it on any other insects, but black ants and I haven't tried it outdoors, just indoors. It's not a permanent solution to bug control. Eventually the ants kept coming into my kitchen and I had to call an exterminator. I'd recommend this product if you have just a couple of little bugs you want to get rid of and you don't want any toxic sprays around food, children or pets. Otherwise, for a large infestation or reoccurring infestation, this product doesn't really help with that."
4,Great for traveling!,"I bought and used this storage device to accomodate a recent trip to Thailand. It is somewhat akin to an ipod on steroids. Though bulky as in won't fit in your pocket, it's still less cumbersome and takes up far less space than a laptop. In addition to excellent playback of MP3s and gigantic storage of that medium, I used it to store all of the digital photos that I wanted to take with me, plus the pictures I took on the trip. There is the added advantage of being able to interface the unit with a television. Voila, a high quality digital slide show. My only complaint is the limited number of video codecs on board. Otherwise it's a great unit to travel with."
4,Like an adventure story.,"Written much like a historical novel, the book tells a gripping story of this warrior's life and personality. The included map is helpful, but I enjoyed matching up modern large scale maps of the area by identifying the modern names for the historical places. More names on the map might be helpful, though it might make the map harder to read."
5,Great Buy,"These earring were not expensive and yet everyone who won them at the event loved them, and they still wear them to every game!"
4,Wonderful additon to sons room,I bought this for my 4-yr old son who loves Curious George. It brightened up his room tremendously. He loves looking at George before he goes to bed at night and even talks to him. The decals are easy to apply and easy to come off. I highly recommend this product.
4,nice addition to wall,"My son loves Curious George and this was a nice treat for him. For some reason I though it had more stickers that were smaller, but this is only a large set with the ones shown. Easy to apply."
5,Fun Fun Fun,I was concerned because the walls in my grandson's room are bumpy and swirly with paint. The stickers applied perfectly. The colors are bright and vivid. It adds a lot of life to the room. He loves it. His parents love it. I love it. Great product.
4,Would get them again!,"This look so adorable on my son's wall. It was so easy to use, just peel it off the sheet on stick them to the wall. The size is great too, not too small and not too big. We love it!"
3,"Stains walls and takes off paint, but doesn't peel","These are all really cute and look good on walls that are white or light paint colors. They don't peel off after time, but they also don't peel well to reposition either and tear easily even from removing from paper. When we removed them from after 6 months or so, the wall had a definite oil stain from the sticker and many ripped off paint and drywall. :("
4,Fills up a wall!,"The Curious George wall decal is huge and filled up some blank wall space in my son's room. He was really excited to see George on his wall. I think it is a very good value for the price considering it's size and how great it looks (like George is painted on).I knocked off a star because I noticed some peeling a couple of times but not a big deal. The decal has been on the wall for a month and if there is no more peeling, I might bump up the rating to 5 stars.Overall, everyone is very happy with the decal."
5,Love it!,"This giant wall sticker is great. Very easy to apply to the wall and the bright colors are great! Even if you need to reposition it, it is easy to do!"
5,Best Season of Storm Chasers.,"Season 3 takes place during the 2009 Tornado season. It introduces Tim Samaras and his Twistex team to the cast that already included Sean Casey and the TIV and Reed Timmer and TVN. Starting in Season 3 Reed starts driving into tornadoes as he invests in an armored vehicle similar to the TIV which he calls the Dominator. Sean Casey finally gets ""the Shot"", Reed intercepts multiple tornadoes and Tim Samaras' team gets multiple intercepts as well. I would put this season ahead of the rest because of its production value. This season, along with Season 2, is narrated by Harry Prichett. He did a fantastic job narrating this show but for some reason no one narrates season 4 and he doesn't return to narrate Season 5. This is also a better copy to buy. The DiscoveryStore version is almost 50 dollars here on Amazon and its 30 on the DiscoveryStore. This version is way more affordable and it includes the same 8 episodes from season three."
4,What season is this?,"Little confused about the seasons here. Netflix is running 3 seasons on their site. Season 3 is actually season 2 on that. Season 2 is season 1. Season 3 is what is being sold as season 4 on Amazon.Could someone enlighten me as to which season is what? Overall, the series is excellent and the DVD's are very well done. I would just like to know which season is which."
1,Just a bunch of guys arguing about where they are,"I got this for my son who is fasinated with storms. This DVD shows more footage of a bunch of guys getting lost and bickering than storm footage. If you are looking for a reality show then this is for you. If you are looking for a documentary on storms, then don't waste your money on this one."
4,Storm Chasers Season 3 on DVD review,"I recently purchased ""Storm Chasers Season 3"" DVDs here since I had seasons 1 & 2 already on DVDs, I figured I would go ahead and get season 3 at this time.Kind of hard to review a DVD or video cassette of a show, but my personal opinion says that the season 3 set of this ""Storm Chasers"" shows is overall not bad. Of course, there is quite a bit of tornado video clips and plenty of action. The super professionals on the prior seasons 1 & 2 were not on the third season however and that sort of disapointed me somewhat, but overall, it's still a good DVD and if you're a storm or tornado chaser and like to see chasers get pretty close to tornadoes, then I would get this video. It comes on 2 DVD's and lasts several hours long. Overall, 4 out of 5 stars for me on this item."
5,Great for the completist or the new fan,"I had most of their other work before I bought this. I really got it for the DVD component. For the price, you get like 40 minutes of live stuff and a full sort of ""best of"" of music leading up to their Blood Run release. One of my favorite bands ever. A pity about Visqueen tho."
2,Good idea; too bad about the errors,"The book is in general a good idea but has a fatal flaw - it has many math errors. It looks as if the authors took their lectures on signal theory and shoved them into a wavelet context, without stopping to consider what needs changing. It seems every two pages or so is a significant error. This would be ok *if* there were a published errata, but I have found none via google. What good is a book full of errors?"
5,Wonderful work!,"""Jason Miccolo Johnson has compiled a wonderful tribute to the African American Worship Experience! This book is a MUST-HAVE!""-Rev. Nolan Williams, Jr., Chief Music Editor of the African American Heritage Hymnal"
5,Very enjoyable and informative,"Knowing very little about Ethiopia, Eritrea and the area surrounding those countries, I approached this book with an open mind. The authors style immediately put me at ease, as her personal story of adventure, love, family and survival in a new land unfolded. I would recommend this book to any one with even a hint of the romantic in them."
4,Long enought,Nice to get socks that fit. Comfortable with a little pattern. If these hold up as well as earlier gold toe socks I will be happy.
2,Not worth the time or money,Anatomy is a very low yield subject on the exam and vignettes are a time consuming way to study. I did not find this particular book of the series at all helpful. There are more efficient ways to study anatomy.
3,"Some stories are good, some not so good...like this one","IU profs set out to tell the true story of John Dillinger. Alot of the facts are true. Some of the facts have been ""Changed"" for whatever reason. They want you to believe the FBI story that they got their man. Fact is...The guy they shot was the wrong height, Did not have scars that John had, and his eye color was wrong. You can change a lot of things, but height and eye color are not among them. (John had grey eyes, the corpse had brown eyes.) If you can locate a copy of a 70's book Dillinger Dead or Alive? It is a much better read, and goes into the story of an old guy who sent letters to the Indianapolis Star, He had John's handwriting, and knew things only John Dillinger knew. It also identifies the corpse as John Lawrence, a smalltime hood that was a Dillinger wannabe."
3,It was all a farce,"I agree with the reviewer who recommends the Nash book.As shocking as it may seem...that book convinced me that the Feds killed a Dillinger imposter.The death photos clearly show a 'Dandy'... and not Dillinger.Lawrence liked to claim he was Dillinger...and the woman in red used that fact to get herself.. and Dillinger, off the hook.The thing that convinced me the most...was not anything that was pointed out in the book...but my own observation.Look at the photo of the old man who claims to be Dillinger.Yes, he looks quite different...but look at the ears.They are uniquely shaped... and they are identical to Dillinger's.This wasn't even pointed out in the book.Faces age... but ears retain their shape."
4,Marriage of Agreement by Judith Duncan (Conveniently Wed),"Description from the book back cover:Holy matrimony! Jaded Mitch Munroe had never intended to marry again, but when beguiling Maria Rodriguez needed help in becoming a citizen, making her his wife seemed the logical thing to do. And his alluring new bride was giving Mitch one heck of a heated reaction - what could possibly go wrong?? How about falling in love? By conveniently marrying Mitch, Maria would achieve the dream life she'd always wanted. Problem was, her heart was all aflutter for her new husband. It didn't seem fair to continue being Mrs. Munroe when Mitch hadn't planned on love being part of their agreement ... or had he?Conveniently Wed - They married for convenience ... but can love be far behind?"
5,Excellent Value In A CD/Cassette/Digital Tuner Portable,"I have purchased other Aiwa products in the past and this one didn't disappoint me in the least.It is a bit heavy but the reproduced sound is very good.The sound output of the cd,tuner and cassette are all excellent.The quality of Aiwa products has always been consistently very good.This product is also of high quality.I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value in a cd portable under $."
5,A must read for anyone who deals with patients.,"You can never tell a doctor what to do, except in court. This book aims to change that. Managing Patient Expectations holds a mirror up to doctors and others who deal with patients, and lets them see what patients see when dealing with medical practices and hospitals. More important, the book explains practical approaches to streamlining the patient's experience and making the best use of everyone's time. And when patients feel valued, they pay more attention, and may either recover more quickly or be less likely to be ""worried well."" In short: a book no doctor or nurse can afford to ignore if they care about the quality of their practice."
1,where's the boef?,"odd that there is no mention of money or the commodification of healthcare even in the index, odd, since money is what the industry is allabout...commodification defined as too many dollars chasing too fewvirtues.""fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism since itrepresents the merging of state with corporate interests."" mussolini"
4,good as a supplement to the class,"This is a book that is best for final preparation for the exam. Last year, in BC Calculus, I was absent for the series and sequences lessons due to an illness and I came back for a test studying through the Barron's books and I had trouble understanding it. The tests are definitely a lot harder than the real thing. I studied my [...] off and got a 5 on the actual exam as well as a 5 on the AB subscore."
4,A Fair Book,"This book is very comprehensive, too many details at times. The practice test is a little bit more difficult than the actual test. It is not very well organized or appealing to look. There aren't enough diagrams and pictures for visual learners."
4,The Best One Out There,"We actually buy this book for my AP class. Students are encouraged to first thoroughly go through our text, and then as a review, we go right through Baron's. I felt the Princeton book is too easy, whereas the Baron's book does a better (much better) job on prepartion and then gives slightly harder practice tests which is the correct way to prepare for the actual exam."
3,How to Make Your Bath Magical,"I just installed a huge jetted soaking tub and I bought this book to help me christen the tub rituals. :)The book is a quick read, I read it in the tub while I was jetting and aromatherapizing. It isn't very thorough and is a bit out of date as far as product info for the various things she uses in her formulas. It was fun to read - gave me a few good ideas. I will say that if you have any experience with using aromatherapy oils and other feel goods, you probably know what you need to know already. I liked the book but it wasn't earthshaking."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for a book that had recipes for herbal bath teas. This one was very woo-woo metaphysical.There is a ton of padding where the author tells of her need for emotional healing and how spending a lot of time in the water helped her reconnect with her inner woman.Instead of herbs, most of the recipes in the book want you to add Bach flower remedies, the ""holistic"" type where there's 1 part per gazillion of the actual botanical. It also wants you to add a bunch of crystals to your bathwater, burn incense and candles, and meditate on life, the universe, and everything.I suppose if you are into that stuff you might like this book, but I wound up giving it away. I was looking for a how-to book and this one didn't fit the bill."
5,Water Magic is the Book to Have for Those Who Take Bathing Serious,"I purchased this book about 6 years ago and have used it quite often. The bath recipes are wonderful. Whether you bathe alone or with a partner, you'll find the perfect bath for what your soul is craving."
3,What Happened??????,"I thought this book was very good. The story plot was great and easy to follow. HOWEVER, why did the author leave out so many important subplots? If this book was meant to be a continuing story line (which I hope Stella Cameron does) then the transition is VERY VACANT. The ending is one of the most unsatisfying ends I have ever read. I was so confused by the ending that I went to the book store to see if I bought a ""bad"" copy that left out the last chapter.The sad thing is I really thought the main characters, Reb and Marc, were really fun to read. The subcharacters, Cyrus and Martha, caught my interest but what the heck happened to them also?I hope anyone that read COLD DAY IN JULY will not read any other books by Stella Cameron because she is very good. Just don't understand what happened with this book."
1,cold day left me cold,I read alot and have found few books so dissapointing. I may not even finish this book. Ms. Cameron created too many shallow characters. Even the two main characters are not well developed. The reader is not drawn into their world. There are too many ideas and directions in this disjointed book. It is difficult to feel anything for any of the charaters. Do not waste time or money on this book.
2,Not As Good As It Could Be,"This story was not as good as it could have been. I am a big fan of this author so I was a little let down by the fact that I did not care for this story. It had great potential with a great mystery and I love her stories set down in the south. This just did not live up to her other books.I felt that I had come into the story in the middle from the very start. The conversations between the characters were often confusing and at time there were too many characters speaking at the same time. Just as another review stated. All of this added to the uneven flow of the story. This could have been all overlooked if the ending was better. I feel that Ms. Carmeron ended the story too soon and that there was no closure for any of the characters in the story. What happen to everyone and how did they handle the outcome???? I don't think a few more pages to ""wrap things up"" would have been out of order. It could not of hurt in any event."
1,Disappointed,"After reading French Quarter, I was excited after buying this book by Stella Cameron. I wish I had read the reviews before making the purchase--what a disappointment! The plot was disjointed and the dialogue between characters was choppy and adolescent. I'm about three-quarters of the way through the book and just cannot finish it."
1,Disjointed mess!,"Where to begin-this seems like a question the author should have asked herself. The concept is intriguing and has loads of potenial but begins with jumbled confusion that only expands with the plotline. The dialouge is haphazard with bouts of head hoping and disjointed dialouge finished off with a ????? wait there is no finish-no conclusion, no ending, no summation-shall I continue? Did our couple end up together? Did Mark find Amy? Did Cyrus give into his temptations? What about Precious and her husband? Do we care????? However this book does provide hope-if this is writing then we can all become successful authors! Were the editors sleeping?? Don't waste your time and/or money......."
3,Not That Bad...,"Cold Day In July by Stell Cameron wasn't that bad. Well, at least not ad bad as some of the jerks that write bad reviews out of jelousy would have you believe anyway. As a rule I like this writer. Granted this one is not one of Ms. Cameron's better writes, it is however still doable. The editing leaves a lot to be desired and the ending was a disappointment or I would have rated the book 4 Stars."
3,Nice to know I'm not alone...,"I logged on to Amazon.com to see if this book really ended so oddly, or if I was missing pages. It was a very good read, with an unsatisfying ending."
2,Very Bad Cold!,"I would not recommend this book. The writing is so uneven, you don't care what happens to the characters. The ending is terrible. She ends without resolutions for any of the characters. The plot is so convoluted, it's pathetic. You will come away from reading this book feeling totally cheated! I expect more of Stella Cameron than this. I can't believe her publishers actually let this one pass through. They must be getting desperate."
1,Wait for the Cliff notes,"I picked this book up as I had read FRENCH QUARTER and thought this novel would be of the same caliber. My review will be short as 2 other reviewers have summed up my feelings. This book was poorly written. The plot was a disjointed patchwork of subplots. The dialog was static. The writer would randomly hint that a character might have something forthcoming and then drop the thread. There was no flow from one chapter, really paragraph, to another. No explantion was given as to why Father Cyrus felt such anomosity towards Marc, for that matter what had Marc's father done to have a whole town hate him so much? It was never explained and became annoying and stupid when ""town folk"" treated the owner of at least one half the town with such open hostility. It didn't make a lick of sense and that sums up my review of the book."
3,Not up to the series,"Parts I and II of this series...superb; Part III, not so much. Seems less well considered and documented than the first two parts, which are superb and are highly recommended."
1,repackaged music,"I just received this product. I have not used it to sleep yet. my review is not about it's effectiveness for sleep and relaxation. this is the same music that is on the delta sleep system, which i already own. I would not have bought this used cd if I would have known that. now having read other reviews of other cd's, there are other cd's that have the same music. It really should state in the discription that these cd's are the same."
2,It dvd its for women,This dvd is make for women for they to know how to reach an ejaculating orgasm... not for men to know how to make a woman ejaculate by making the love.. if you are a man who wants to know something more about how to make a woman ejaculate.... this is not for you.
3,"Functional, but shoddy construction","This is a simple, functional device. Pass-through works as expected, and it even works on older keyboards like the IBM model M. It won't let through more than a few keys at a time, so you should avoid it if you are a gamer. For other users, it works fine. Construction is very shoddy - the wires pulled out of mine with a little tug, and I had to solder the wires back together.If you don't abuse it, it should work fine. It is a good, inexpensive solution."
3,Unreliable device,"I use this device to connect both an old keyboard and mouse to a Linux PC and sometimes a Mac. In my experience using this converter, it has not be very reliable. Honestly, it works fine, most of the time. And then it will decide to reinitialize the keyboard while I'm in the middle of typing something for no apparent reason, losing my keystrokes for a second or so. The device is usable, and I do use it (for lack of a better option). It's just painful.(And I know it isn't the hardware on either side of it. Other USB keyboard have worked fine with the computers, and I can use a PS/2 connection without any faults.)"
3,Did not like my Labtec keyboard.,"I was typing along until this adapter unexpectedly reset my PS/2 keyboard.Every single PS/2 to USB adapter I have tried, does not like my favorite PS/2 keyboard therefore, they cannot be trusted unless if they require an AC adapter to power. This one was no exception. At least I must give Adesso some credit for not making it hard to open the package and get the item with surprisingly, no sizzors needed. So I had to return it back to Amazon and I'm back to using my Kensington keyboard."
5,excellent buy,Easy to use and put all my spare keyboards and mice to good use. Love it. Price is also very good.
3,PS/2 to USB adapter,"My good old Microsoft keyboard works with it just fine, but it will simply not work with my PS/2 Intellimouse connected to a Dell Inspiron 531 running Vista Home basic. I've had to waste another USB port."
4,Works great for my old keyboard,"I got this so that I could use my old keyboard (KeyTronic Lifetime Designer Black) with a new system that is is USB only. Work great and my num lock and caps lock light work too. The device is a little long, but not excessive and is easy6 to use. I could not get my USB mouse to work with it (USB to PS/2 converter into this PS/2 to USB converter) so I had to plug my mouse into another USB port, but that is no big deal.A PS/2 mouse did work with the device so I think it is an issue with the signal being converted too many times."
2,Doesn't work for Logitech T-CL13,"After reading the all the glowing reviews for this adapter, I thought I couldn't go wrong. Unfortunately, it's not working with my T-CL13. I tried both a PS/2 keyboard and mouse, both Microsoft, and those worked, but I suspect they'd both work with a standard ""straight through"" type adapter as well."
1,What a gyp,"It's a subpar product that doesn't work as it's supposed to. Sure, it works fine every ten minutes or so, but then there's no signal on my IBM Model M keyboard for about 1-2 seconds as it reboots. This is EXTREMELY frustrating and annoying, especially for a gamer. You have critical times at which you cannot just suddenly not being to punch keys during online battle. I'm really upset that there are so many outstanding reviews for this product, when all I got was a piece of crap."
1,"Does not work on Unicomp keyboards, IBM Model M","I bought a brand new Unicomp Ultra Classic and this Adesso PS/2 to USB adapter. I use my keyboard at work and during the course of a day the keyboard will become unresponsive and then basically power cycle, all 3 lights become lit on my keyboard then it returns to normal. I bought another adapater sold on here called the PS2 Keyboard To USB Adapter by Ziotek and have not had any trouble so far. I would not recommend this adapter for the Model M type keyboards."
1,"WANTED it to work, but...","I really wanted this to work so I could use my old MS Natural Keyboard and Logitech Trackman Marble FX mouse with my new Dell Windows 7 pc, but it disappoints. When I type, the information from the keys to the computer goes astray frequently, leaving me with holes in the text where the words I entered should be. Or the text stalls and eventually catches up. Not good. I replaced this with the comparable Belkin product, which works perfectly. My advice: buy the Belkin and skip this product."
4,"Arrived a bit crushed, but worked any way","When I received this item, it had been obviously crushed during shipping.The packaging was a bit squished and the USB connection was also squished a bit. No shattering of the plastic of the device itself though.I did have to carefully unsquish the USB connector in order to get it tall enough to fit into the connector on my Mac Mini.Ever since then, it seems to be working fine.Make sure that you have enough packing to protect the device when you ship it."
5,Works for Mac mini,"I bought this to provide a connection from my old Dell ergonomic keyboard (SK-6000, but that's a detail) to my brand new Mac Mini (May 2009). I plugged it in, turned on the mini, and after it started up I was shown a screen saying the Mac didn't recognize the keyboard. But no problem, it asked me to press the key to the right of the left ""Shift"" key, then the key to the right of the right ""Shift"" key, and the Mac figured out the rest.My mouse is usb, so I didn't use the mouse connection. The device works with just a keyboard cable plugged into it.No software to deal with, everything works great, and I'm completely satisfied with this handy gizmo."
2,"Loses mouse clicks, not reliable enough for me...","I purchased this product to connect my Logitech Trackman Marble FX trackball to my computer through a USB port. It does work for that purpose, but is not at all reliable. This device loses mouse clicks frequently, up to 50% of the time, making it virtually unusable for my purposes. I replaced it with a straight PS/2 extension cable to the PS/2 port of the computer and the clicks are all getting through just fine now.UPDATE:I got a new laptop at work and it didn't have any PS2 ports at all so I took this adapter in to connect my PS2 keyboard to the new computer. Another fail on the part of the adapter. The keyboard would show up if you plugged it in after the laptop was booted up. But if the keyboard was left connected then the computer wouldn't recognize it all after boot up.This adapter is relegated to the bottom of my computer junk drawer now!"
2,It Half Works...,"Most times if you plug in a mouse and keyboard, simultaneously, it only recognizes one or the other. If you use it to just plug in one ps/2 device, it works perfectly. It's fine for me since i have a ps/2 keyboard and a usb mouse. I would definitely recommend against it, if you need to plug in two ps/2 devices at the same time."
1,would have been nice if it worked,"used this with winxp on acer aspire one netbook with logitech cordless elite duo. keyboard worked with this adapter. mouse didnt. have tried unsuccessfully to get this to work, ready to give up. waste of money and time.the mouse works fine if using a separate usb which was what i was trying to avoid with this single usb port converter.no manual, no name on the ""supposedly"" product package.dont buy this, espcially if u bought this like me to avoid two port. doesn't work. zero star would be more appropriate, but at least the keyboard works... ha!"
1,Worked perfectly -- for a couple months.,"I schlep a laptop between different business sites and being able to use a full-size keyboard really helps. Most of the available keyboards at the sites have a PS2 connection (round little purple plug), while my laptop is all USB. This adapter allowed me to use those PS2 keyboards and mice without a problem -- for a while.Unfortunately, the wires have started to fall apart after only a couple months. The mouse part of the product has stopped working. I expect that the keyboard connection will give out pretty soon, too. I can't locate the manufacturer to see if they'd be willing to do the right thing and replace the product or give me a full refund (if anyone from Amazon.com is reading this, please let me know if there's any recourse).Initially, I gave this product a five-star review. Too bad it falls apart so quickly."
1,Logitech Trackman PS/2 to USB Window 7 does not work,I bought this for my wired Logitech Trackman Wheel (PS/2) for mynew built Shuttle XPC Computer which has only USBIt did not work...
2,Keys stick,"It's a great idea, and for the most part the product works great, but every once in a while a key will ""stick"" and repeat itself several times. I bought more than one, so installed another one and it did the same thing. I'm the network admin for a school, and I cannot have that happening to our school secretary, so I'm returning this one and getting one of a different brand."
3,"good for some things, not for others","This item works with other devices, but does NOT work with the Que Cat device, as mentioned in other reviews."
5,"Works Great, Serves its purpose","Not much to say about this - it works well. If you have an older keyboard/mouse that you want to use on a newer PC/Laptop/Netbook that doesn't have PS/2 ports, this adapter is for you. Good price and functions great.No surprises with this purchase."
5,Works great with mac,"Connected a PC Keyboard (ps2) with a foreign language to my mac using this adapter. It not only works great but my mac recognized the adapter by name and brand. 99% of keys on keyboard work, including itunes controls like pause, play forward and stop. Mac's volume control also works through keyboard.Save yourself time and eventually money buy this one instead of he cheapo ones."
5,Thais thing rocks,"Worked like a champ! I used this adapter to connect a PS2 keyboard and mouse to a USB KVM that was connected to both a PC and a Macbook. I was nervous that the KVM would kill it, but to my great joy it didn't. I plan to buy another!"
4,"Doesn't seem to be the listed brand, but it works","The item I received doesn't seem to be the Adesso brand that was listed, but so far it is working perfectly with the nice clicky IBM Model M keyboard that I wanted to use it with. The shipping was timely (received within 4 days from order) but for some reason the shipping status listed on the Amazon site never changed. Even now it Amazon shows it as being prepared for shipment."
4,Excellent product life extender,"I was using a crappy Dynex keyboard on my machine at work (a Dell Optiplex 745). Due to issues with this keyboard (random disconnects and stuck keys), I decided I needed a new keyboard. I am a programmer, so a decent keyboard is pretty important to me. I could have gone for a newer expense keyboard, but I decided to the cheap/green route. I had an old IBM Model M2 keyboard lying around that I figured would be perfect for work. So glad I bought this thing because all of my keyboard problems have disappeared.I can't speak for other PS/2 to USB adapters, but this one is fantastic for my purposes. A very worthwhile upgrade!"
4,Works fine,I bought two of these so that I could use them to convert an old PS/2 based KVM to USB for use with a Macintosh as well as my newer PC.. Did the job nicely.
3,cable,Was adapting a legacy system so not easy to find. Words well and at the right price. Not problems at all.
1,For ' windows 7 ' it sucks,"im windows 7 user(1/1,2010) i got it yesterday, and i tried it la-ah-ts of times, but it does work.. only with keyboard.i dare you not even to try have a experiment."
3,Laptop Charger,The only complaint i have is the cord with the three holes in it that is the power cord is very loose and falls out. Luckily my son had that cord from his OLD charger. Other than that the item came when it was expected ..Thank you
5,Buy This...for your laptop connections~!,"First off, if you are looking at those ""non working"" PS2 to USB adapters to make connections to your laptop for external keyboard/mouse use...FORGET IT and buy this!At first I was skeptical about flushing more monies down toilet for another gadget ""claiming"" PS2 to USB made easy...but this product ACTUALLY recognized my external PS2 KEYBOARD and MOUSE on my Gateway(cheap-way) laptop!!Here is a hint: SEE if your laptop has a ""female"" monitor port on the back(for hooking up your ""male"" PC monitor to laptop) if it does, then buy this for your external keyboard/mouse PS2 TO USB connections (forget that ""BOX"" gadget costing $100 or more)."
1,Does not work with USB cordless mice & PS/2 KVMs,"This converter does not work to connect a Logitech USB wireless mouse on a PS/2 KVM switch. Someone said it did work, but it doesn't. I wish I wouldn't have wasted money on this."
2,Poorly made,"Wires came loose, worked ok for a few months but needed to be pluged and unplugged or computer would stop recognizing it. This seems to happen a lot with these things... just break down and buy a USB mouse and keyboard."
1,"Adesso PS/2 to USB Adapter, connects 2 PS/2 connectors to 1 USB port...","Chose to work combination keyboard and touch-pad on desk computer, but it did not work so had to purchase a separate touch-pat."
3,I wanted to use an existing keyboard and trackball with a newer computer.,It was useless for the trackball but fine with the keyboard. No adapter I have tried works with the trackball. There are no more available of the type I like except the wireless model which works well.
2,Work great - for a while,"We bought three of these about 6 months ago and they all worked great. Very handy.After 3 months one failed - computer reported 'unrecognizable USB device'.I know they're not very expensive, but if it doesn't work, it's still a waste of money."
5,The One to Buy,"I have 4 computers connected through a KVM switch, and the newer ones have no PS/2 ports. I've tried virtually all of the available alternatives, and this is the only one which has worked right out of the box with both an HP laptop (Vista) a Dell Desktop (Vista) and a Gateway desktop (XP SP2). The workmanship on other splitters was awful--I returned one of the alternatives you can find on Amazon 3 different times--once the mouse worked, but not the kbd, once the kbd worked but not the mouse. I tried another unit where the kbd and mouse wire had to be swapped, and it stopped functioning in about two weeks. The replacement shipped for that one did not work at all...This one worked right away on three different machines.Go buy a cheaper one that you'll have to RMA 2 or 3 times before you give up, convince yourself that I'm right, and then come back and get this one. For the extra $8-$10 this one costs you'll be much happier."
5,works great with a model M,Works just fine on a laptop and a desktop! Buy this if you need to connect an IBM model M clicky.
1,didn't work,"I previously posted a negative view of this product because it did not work and when I tried to return it to CableMart I had serious issues. Amazon's A-Z Return Policy was great and they returned my money. My previous comments are gone from this review site and I'm not sure why. Cablemart pressured me to remove them and when I wouldn't, they stopped communicating with me. They told me to keep the converter when I told them I wasn't going to pay for the postage to return it. Bottom line--didn't work."
2,not working with switch view (KVM) / USB mouse,"if you need this product in order to connect it to a switch view (KVM) it did not work, the mouse was not recognizedalso if you have a USB mouse and a convertor (USB to PS2) it is not working, it did not recognize the mouse , I had to directly connect the mouse, disconnect it (after driver was installed) and connect throught the adapter , and it worked until the next boot,this is not a problem of the mouse or windows, when the usb mouse connected to the PS port directly (throught the USB/PS2 adapter) it worked, only when the adapter (splitter is in use it wont work)"
2,not for emacs,"This product works, however: I use an editor called emacs. Using this editor properly involves a lot of complicated mashing of shift, control and alt keys. This device often ends up in a confused state (unaware that I'm still holding down the alt key, for example). This one:[...]works better for me, though I see it's now out of stock."
5,Works exactly as expected,"After attaching this adapter to one of the USB 2.0 ports on my new WinXP netbook, I was able to attach and begin using the full-size keyboard and the trackball that I used to use with my (failed) Windows 98 desktop PC.Very pleased with this purchase."
4,Excellent sourcebook for DMin projects etc.,I was recommended this book by a colleague at another seminary. I have directed our Library Director to have copies of this on reserve in all our libraries. There is not a better collection of tests and measurements available for use in field-based research in ministry. I highly recommend this book.
1,Toooooooooooo little...,"This thing is way too little. It doesn't see anything. It might be okay if you have a very small infant that does not move, but to use at work, as it is advertised can be, it is no good. The reception is fine, you just can't see anything because there is no range on the cameras and no view on the monitor!"
3,TWO FANTASTIC SONGS BY BO,"THE LONDON BO DIDDLEY SESSIONS WERE RECORDED AROUND THE SAME TIME AS THE LONDON HOWLIN WOLF SESSIONS AND FEATURE A LOT OF THE SAME ENGLISH MUSICIANS PLAYING ON IT: IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, AMONG THEM RORY GALLAGHER, ERIC CLAPTON, STEVIE WINWOOD AND OTHERS. CHESS RECORDS DECIDED TO GO TO ENGLAND AND RECORD A COUPLE OF ALBUMS WITH ENGLISH BLUES LOVING MUSICIANS BACK IN THE VERY EARLY 70'S. NOT EVERY SONG IS A WINNER, BO AND HIS MUSIC WERE GOING THROUGH A TRANSITION AT THAT TIME, HE WAS PLAYING MORE ""FUNK"" AT THIE TIME, BUT TWO SONGS: BO-JAM AND MAKE A HIT RECORD, ARE WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION ON FOR THIS CD. A BETTER ALL-AROUND MORE A FOUR OR FIVE STAR ALBUM FROM AROUND THIS TIME IS ""DRIVE BY BO"", THAT ONE REALLY ROCKS FROM START TO FINISH."
4,bo diddley london sessions,i thought london sessions was good buy wasn;t the diddley of old but is well worth to add to your diddley collection.
1,Not for Serious Students,"I have purchased two earlier versions of Encarta and this is my last. The African American section is denigrating to both AAs and women. Young students have ample opportunity to view video clips of rock concerts and nightclub performers elsewhere. For serious students who need basic information without 2.2GB of distracting trivia, I'd recommend keeping Encarta 99.The two hours I spent loading this software were completely wasted. I've reloaded '99."
2,Litte fresh insight,"It is disappointing that this book brings so few fresh insights to the subject. The authors seem to have nothing much to say other than repeating views that have been spelled out by other economists and academics. While it can serve as a reference, it doesn't have too much value as a piece of scholarly work."
1,One heretical book,"It remains absurd that McBrien continues to call this book ""Catholicism."" You will notice that it does not have a bishop's imprimatur. That's because this book is not faithful either to Catholic doctrine or dogma. The section on the Blessed Virgin Mary contains the statement, ""It is not necessary to believe in the perpetual virginity of Mary in order to be a Catholic."" This is a heresy condemned by the early Church councils. The perpetual virginity of Mary is dogma in both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Denying a dogma results in excommunication. Buy the Catechism of the Catholic Church and leave speculative theology to the heretics."
1,Misleading at best,"For those that truly want to know what the Catholic Church stands for, this is NOT the book to read. McBrien, perhaps in an honest, but misguided, sense of ecumenicalism has watered down some core truths about the Church. By saying that Catholicism is ""equal in truth"" to other faiths he denies the very vows he takes. While Catholics believe that our separated Protestant brethen have shares of the truth, it is the belief that the Catholic Church carries the full truth, and McBrien should know this. I would warn fence straddling, lapsed and new Catholics away from this book, and urge non-Catholics to seek more orthodox Catholic writers than McBrien. His book does not reflect actual Church teachings!"
1,Only one question I need answered,"It seems to me it would be useful for all Catholics considering this work if someone would be so kind as to let us know if it bears the nihil obstat (meaning a diocesan censor has cleared the work), and whether it bears the bishop's imprimatur (meaning the bishop thought the work worth publishing and gave it his statement of approval). Anyone care to give us that information?"
1,Looks Catholic but is NOT Catholic,"I own two of McBrien's books (Catholicism & Encyclopedia). They look very serious on Catholicism, but they are NOT. They contain a lot of McBrien's thoughts about what should be Catholicism. In other words, McBrien wishes the Catholic Church to conform to his opinions. A waste of money. Buy the Catechism of the Catholic Church instead. For more detailed review on McBrien's books, go to catholicculture.org and search for McBrien."
3,want to know what's wrong with catholicism? ...,"... Read this book. The whole accurate history of the most dictatorial and evil religion out there. You'll better understand where its followers are coming from and where they get their strange ideas about what constitutes good living and spirituality. It covers the inquisition, the burning of scientists, and the present day crusades against science, all common sense and compassion.To understand pure evil, this is the book for you."
3,religious,A good book for studying the beliefs of the Catholic church. i would recomend the Compendium to accompany this book
1,Biased,"If your looking for a non biased history of Catholicism this isn't it. Fr. McBrien is a well known dissident who doesn't believe in the sacred ministry or the unique aspects of the Church. He disagrees with traditional liturgy, supports womens ordination and all the other liberal causes. He is a well known critic of Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI and this book shows that bias. Avoid this ideological tome, and seek out a non biased book."
1,Stilted presentation further undermines weak analysis,"McBrien seems more interested in being a ""bad boy"" than a serious scholar. Despite the book's length, important periods in Catholic Church history are presented in a stilted and simplistic manner. Any freshman student of logic can find all of the major logical fallacies amply represented in the first three chapters."
1,Not Catholicism,"McBrien seems to have forgotten what it means to be a believing Catholic. Worse yet he foists his errors on the unsuspecting. I guess he enjoys being the ""village heretic"". Perhaps he likes the attention in an adolescent kind of way. Just read the Catechism for the truth about Catholicism."
3,the 7th moderm plague....,"drawing me in with a tantalizing title and promise of much explanations, i am left perplexed.the author makes tenuous links between this and that, throws around a lot of names of scientists and 'victims' of the said plagues but does not provide much scientific background.this reads like a Harlequin, you read it fast and you forget it fast."
2,Make sure you know what you're getting,"Be warned....this book has little to do with modern plagues and more to do with a left-wing environmentalist agenda. Even worse, Mark Walters has trouble deciding how to write his book, switching back and forth between semi-scientific writing and silly poetic descriptions. In the end, though, he doesn't present the reader with anything new. All of this information should be fairly common knowledge to anyone who reads a newspaper as often as once a week."
5,So far this volume remains my favorite,"Checking as to when the next novel by Felice Picano is due out, I realized that though I have read all his books I have never written about them in this forum. Strange, but understandable when I look back over all the experiences of reading his work. Picano writes in the manner of long nighttime walks with a close friend: he shares quips and bedazzling escapades and memories of lost friends like few others. His stories are at once funny, tender, bitchy (in a way that few can imitate), and just plain good stories. In A HOUSE ON THE OCEAN, A HOUSE ON THE BAY he seems to have paused in the midst of memories very special to him...or at least his characters are so acutely drawn that they seem like pages from a diary. If you've ever wondered what Fire Island was like at its peak, here it is. Wonderful tales populated by people you'd like to know....or at least have observed! Felice Picano keeps treating us to fine writing and I eagerly await ONYX!"
4,Operators and Representation Theory : Canonical Models for A,"This book is an excellent introduction to representation theory in quantum mechanics and outlines abstract topics in a pedagogically sound manner. I would recommend this book for beginning graduate students in physics or for anyone interested in learning about how to work with Heisenberg, Schroedinger, etc. representations and how to apply that to intersting problems. Knowledge of undergraduate quantum mechanics is required."
4,"beautiful art, ok storyline","I like this book because my son's name is Ciaran and it's fun to read to him since he has an unusual name for here in the US. The art is gorgeous and the pictures really tell the heart of the story. The actual prose story skips around a bit since it covers St. Ciaran's whole life. Though not stellar storytelling, the art make it worthwhile."
3,"Taking ""less"" from the word ""GodLESS!""","Born in the early sixth century, this little-know saint was called to bring God's word to Godless Ireland.(originally attempted to review this when the book first came out, but unfortunately the template did not ""take."")"
5,Soul Music,"I first heard this music at Kallah in DeKalb when it was newly released and I said to others, ""That music connects with my soul. I have to have it."" I am on my third copy of the CD because I wore out the first two. I have used it in stress management workshops I've conducted at a university I taught at for many years. The students are from varied backgrounds and religious traditions. They love the music. It's wonderful if you're familiar with the prayers; it's wonderful if you're not Jewish and are willing to let the melodies carry you to heights. I am professor emerita in psychology at my university."
1,complete junk,My daughter and I have worked through about a dozen science kits of various types--this is the absolute worst. I have never seen anything like it. The parts are extremely poorly designed for the task and of very poor quality. We through this kit out after an hour. We will search elsewhere for a different radio kit.
4,Arkansas and the New South: 1847-1920,"A very interesting book! Moneyhon's focuses on the rebuilding of Arkansas' government and economy is very concise. He details the difficult tasks of building an infrastructure to lure industry and commerce to Arkansas. Another area that the book focused on was the begining of the transformation from the slave labor economy to a more modern agricultural and industrial economy. Moneyhon also does a good job of describing the hardships of the countless poor farmers and sharecroppers. The plights of the newly freed slaves are also portrayed in detail. Being from Arkansas, this book not only expanded the stories that I was already familiar with, but also taught me new histories of the state. A ""must read"" if you are interested in the post-Civil War South."
2,Disappointing,"Although they do state that some things may be missing and replaced with something else, I did not expect it to be one of the main things which was the edible handcuffs. That was one of the main reasons I bought this box. The candy is medicore and not worth the value. Not knowing what you are getting because they can replace any of the products that they don't have at the time is not a good way to shop. I don't blame them, I blame myself for not taking that into consideration when I purchased it."
3,It was OK....,It had a few fun candies but most of it is normal stuff you can get anywhere. I would not buy it again.
3,"Strange, but effective insomnia aid.","I bought this boxed set on a somewhat desperate whim during the last trimester of a pregnancy that featured intense insomnia. I'd had this problem before with a previous gestation, but had effective relief with some childbirth hypnosis tapes that I can't find on the net anymore. So, I tried this boxed set hoping it would be relaxing, soothing, and encourage sleep. Well, it's very effective for that purpose. It's very difficult to stay awake during the first (spoken) section. However, the voice on the CD is very strange and changes enough that you ""unrelax"" and think...""boy, that's really weird."" Of the four CD's the ""Body"" CD seems to be the least corny and effective. There does seem to be a lasting relaxation effect, but I can't really say that I've noticed any substantial changes. OK to try, but you may want to start with something cheaper."
4,Brainwave Journey Dr. Jeffrey Thompson,"UNREAL! This was my first REAL introduction to thisform of relaxation. Although I didn't find tapes1,3 & 4 to be as enjoyable as Cassette 2 (Journeyof the Mind)I lay on the floor with my eyes closed and experiencedeuphoria like I have never thought possible thrumusic. If anyone had walked in they would have thoughtI was nuts, lying there with a big happy cheesy grin, revellingin my latest musical DISCOVERYBRAVO BRAVO!We could all use a 30 minute relaxation breather EVERY DAY!Loved it!"
5,AMAZING!!,This book is absolutely amazing! It has everything you need if you really love books and take the idea of a used bookstore seriously!It is one of the best books I have ever read and you will be inspired beyond all you can imagine!!!
2,Outdated,"Here and there some good advice, much of it pretty obvious stuff about doing retail business in general--but for the most part, obsolete and often misleading when it comes to specifics about the trade. The book is almost twenty years old, and the internet has made much of it irrelevant--he starts off by describing used book stores as ""a tremendous growth industry"". If you want to know how to build shelves, greet customers, and set up your store, he has some useful things to say, but his advice on what to stock (Harlequin romances?????) is absurd, and his pricing formulas make little sense. I'm thinking about buying a bookstore, and this book was very little help to me."
5,Fun puzzle,This is a well-made puzzle with vibrant colors and a beautiful Fall-themed picture. It was fun and challenging to put together. All pieces were present.
2,Disappointing atlas: where is the world?,"Very disappointing atlas, it mainly portrays the US, while the rest of the world is neglected. The scale on US maps is 1 to 2,500 while for most of the world is 1 to 5,000 or 1 to 10,000. I really regret I bought it."
3,Kinky Computer Stuff,"This is a picture book. It contains no words. It is kinda amusing, but you will not unlock any erotic mysteries with it."
2,Lacks proper information,I am trying to simply find out if the unit comes with an AC adapter. It is impossible to determine this!! I cannot find any info. on any of the websites. Calls to the AIWA people at 1 800 289 2492 are futile. You are bounced around from one operator to another. AIWA has just lost my business.
4,Lots of fun,"Lots of fun, well worth the cost. I got it for my 3 year old son and we spend lots of time him and I building all of the different structures possible with this set."
2,Not for 4 year olds,Very disappointed in this purchase. Sent it back for a refund. This toy is not what it appears to be and should be for 7-8 yrs of age. This frusterated me and I am in my 30's as well as a friend of the family and she is in her 40's. Not at all what I thought it was.
5,Learning action/reaction and having fun!,"Actually slows down my 2 1/2 year old to see action/reaction consequences. Super fun. I recommend just going ahead and springing for this set, it's the marble run you imagine when you think of one (if that makes any sense?). Tons of pieces, tons of marbles, different configurations, well made, not wobbly- this is a really substantial marble run that can be used for a long time."
4,quadrilla review,It's a nice maize but has its faults. Marbles fall off the track and marbles often don't work correctly when they go through the blocks. I am a little sad because it's expensive and has flaws.
4,just what i was looking for,These surrated blades are not easy to find. There heavy duty. I use them for cutting car tires off rims. The only ones I found to not snap easy.
5,awesome!,"handy for everything. they even cut through fiber reinforced peel and stick flashing twice as well, and drywall like butter in comparing to normal blades. these blades last longer too. could not have asked for a better product. these blades will put irwin blades out of business. the only drawback, and it is a small one, it is a little harder to sharpen a pencil (just a little). happy i got the 100 pack too, they dont carry these anywhere locally,i have checked everywhere."
3,Only 40 Cards,Don't expect a 60 card deck like I did. This is 40 basic flying cards. I used them for trading to a friend who didn't have many flying cards.
3,"Good, but only for wood","I have a hard plastic Bb clarinet, and I bought these pad savers for it. Turns out, plastic clarinets don't need pad savers. If you are planning on buying pad savers, make sure they will be for a wood clarinet. Some people have even told me that they don't use them for their wood clarinets because they leave lint in the bore. These really arent even required, but if you think you need them, go ahead, they're cheap enough."
1,Use common sense!,"Forget this product. As long as you swab out your wood clarinet properly your pads will be fine. Whenever possible, swab it out and store it on a stand or with the case open. Either way, you need to keep the moisture out of the instrument and then the case. Let common sense prevail."
5,"""Which Is Willy?""","""Bright"" is the author - not part of the title. This book has the same charm for kids as the Georgie the Ghost books also by Robert Bright; viz. the world is a safe place overall, and although we meet up with the occasional contretemps, everything turns out all right in the end. Willy is a penguin who wants to be different from all the other penguins and goes to some lengths to assert his individuality. A fun book, with great penguin pix!"
1,Victorian Chic is Shabby,"This is the book for those who believe that Victorian style is described best in the Shabby Chic manner. If white is your color and if Victorian means old lace, roses, vintage pottery, tarnished silverplate, and quilts, you will love this book. Personally, I like my Victorian more in the stle of the Grand Epoch. Give me rich jewel tones, heavy furniture, a plethora of good silver, beautiful china, heavy draperies and everything over the top. If you agree with my taste, I fear you will find this book insipid and worse. Yet, as the French say, Vive le difference!"
2,Old News,"This one goes straight to Goodwill or the Salvation Army. The ideas are old news, and not good old news as in shabbby or granny chic, but very dated. Implementing what is shown here would take your look back to 70's country Victorian, and then you'd need to update your update."
2,not what I expected,I was disappointed in these - I had expected something more elegant. They are heavy and look dated.
2,Don't Bother,"This book blows. If you find an old rattied up copy in a used bookstore, don't bother. The cover is lackluster. The text is written poorly. The research, however, is excellent. The photos are nice, but few of them. The paperstock is horrible and the ink bleeds through most pages."
1,I am confused,Perhaps I have a different cookbook or maybe it is because I am basing this after only trying one recipe-but-I do not understand the raves for this book. The recipe for Braised Italian Beef came out so poorly that I had make something else for my dinner guests. I am just glad that I made this the night before.
3,Extraorinary Faith,"I had seen this movie on TV once before. A scene where Hudson Taylor and his wife were sitting at a table in China without food or money stayed in my mind. A desire to purchase this DVD stayed with me and I purchased it from Amazon. It is an older movie without all the bells and whistles of newer movies. The movie takes you from Hudson's arrival in China,the challenges he faces while there, and his love for the people of China. One quote from the movie and the scene described above is, ""God's will, done God's way, will never lack God's provision."" It is amazing to see even through very difficult times, Hudson Taylor trusts God and God is faithful to Hudson Taylor. It will challenge you in your walk with God and your faith in Him."
4,Hudson Taylor DVD,"We enjoyed this DVD very much. very glad we purchased it, and will be lending it to friends. It helped us to see how comfortable we are here in our American Christianity -- and how much deeper we can go with the Lord in serving others for His kingdom."
2,Not What I Was Hoping,I found the acting to be painfully unreal and the events not to be thorough. I would have preferred to have a good audio-book about Hudson Taylor if they can't get actors who are believable.
4,Not bad at all...,"This was my first AD&D book, even though I play a lot. I thought the book was actually quite good.. I don't have many bad comments about the book... The characters were very solid, as was the plot... Monte Cook is a good writer for an excellent campaign in an even cooler universe."
3,"Good book, but could have been better",When I started reading this book i enjoyed it from the beginning. During the book i enjoyed reading it too but it lacked some chracter development. There were some things like the Taint that wasn't explained enough to me. Over all i felt satisfied with this book and I hope there will be a sequel. I will definently buy the sequel if there is one.
3,Cheap camcorder recording of a decent seminar,"The content itself is reasonably insightful, but the technical quality of the production is very low (from the bad hand-held camera work, to the mediocre titleing and nearly absent soundtrack) and renders an immediately drab first impression. Very much an amateur production, on the technical end.Basically, it's a cheap camcorder recording of one of his seminars.Overall, this video is dry and falls short of inspirational. They should re-film and re-produce it. The material itself is worthwhile though."
1,Look Elsewhere,"The description clearly identifies this book as a collection of writings on Buddhism, but I don't see any great value in these particular selections from great works. For instance, the Kerouac text is simply a piece of Dharma Bums. I would recommend reading Dharma Bums rather than pursuing this book for a couple of pages. An early student may find the extensive bibliography and glossary of benefit, however, I wouldn't recommend this book as a starting point. Instead one should try: Dalai Lama - ""How to Practice"", Batchelor - ""Buddhism without Beliefs"", Goddard - ""A Buddhist Bible"", and, of course, Hesse - ""Siddhartha"". Unfortunately, I found this book to be a poor stepping stone on my personal path."
5,window claner,"This is the best window cleaner I have ever used. Windex and sparkle along with the other brands streak. Bissell does not. I cannot find it in the stores anywhere in Louisville, Ky. Why do they always take products off the market when they are working?"
3,Average Surrender Cinema Movie,"As my second Surrender Cinema flick I was looking forward to seeing Virtual Encounters. Not only do I love Elizabeth Cayton (Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity) but I had just seen The Exotic House Of Wax by Surrender Cinema, and aside from it being an outright soft core porno, it had an interesting storyline between the sex as well.Not so with Virtual Encounters. While it was nice to see the expected sex scenes aplenty in this movie, there was no story whatsoever.Kaitan hooks herself up to the Virtual Reality machine and it shows her all types of sexual pleasures. They try and develop Kaitan's character as a shy woman who isn't comfortable with her sexuality. As a result, her relationship is suffering. Her boyfriend gives her the gift of Virtual Reality and she loves it.A so-so movie I would watch the Exotic House Of Wax instead."
2,Virtually...,"Why do we need the canned music for each sex scene? These type of movies are so much more erotic with some actual noise from the participants. Also, some of the boobs in this movie are monstruously unappealing. They are sooo fake it is such a turn off. Give me some perky 'A' cups over huge fake 'D' cups anyday.I'll give this movie two stars, because some of the scenes had potential..."
3,Elizabeth Kaitan is reason enough to watch..,"gotta be honest: Elizabeth Kaitan is the reason I rented this. The plot has something to do with an executive (played by Kaitan) who has something of a cold personality. Her boyfriend buys her a membership into a ""virtual reality"" service, where she can get in touch with her sensual side.it's not Shakespeare, but this is good for relaxing weekend viewing. Kaitan brings energy and enthusiasm to the role."
1,really poorly made,"While nobody expects a skin flick to have a plot or emmy award winning acting, this movie failed to meet my already low expectations.I had 2 issues with this movie.1. The music: the sound track is more fitting for an info-mercial than for an erotic movie. I think I heard the same music in the ad for the DR Field and Brush mower.2. The acting...I expected the in-between acting to be bad- everyone does. But the acting when they're pretending to have sex was simply sub-par. They didn't look as they were even trying to be convincing. Maybe I'm just a hard critic, or maybe these people are simply not good at sex. Find a different title if you're looking for anything halfway decent."
2,"""Virginal"" Encounters might be a better title [:-(","All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place. Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized. Has the art of ""posing"" been lost by modern girls? Maybe all the good directors have retired or died! What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.In spite of my being a certifiable ""dirty old man"". [:-)"
5,Hot as hell!,I saw this movie on cinemax a few days ago and I had to look it up! The lesbian scenes are great they are really hot. The girls are beautiful and everthing. Most of the movie is just sex and more sex. As the reviewer below said it has hot naked girls how bad can it be?
2,Highly Disappointing,"This movie has a weak plotline, designed to see our hero (heroine, actually) have sex with various partners (girl-boy and girl-girl). Okay, the girl's definitely a babe, as are most of the other actresses. Doesn't sound so bad actually. Be warned, all the good parts must've been cut out, because you'll bounce from one scene to another, just about the time it reaches the PG13 level. If it had any plot, it would become confusing very quickly, but there's no fear of that, all the plot was given in the first few minutes of the show. Yeah, there's a couple of boob shots, but other than that, this movie bites the big one! Needless to say I won't bother with the sequel, but maybe there's a director's cut (If they bothered)..."
3,Sugar Bowl?,Nice products beautifully made but not very practical for every day use more for decoration
4,expensive but handy & reliable...,"I ordered this cable to use with my olympus c-3000z camera, which has 5-pin syncro outlet. usually, most of SLR cameras and prosumer digital cameras have pc (cord) outlet. but, unfortunately, my olympus camera doesn't have it!!! (what a shame thing....! olympus!)So there is no choice but to use this cord to use external flash.(don't forget to buy flash bracket if you are using one of olympus 20X0, 30X0, 40X0 series cameras.)as you know, this cable is expensive compared to pc cord. most of pc cord cables are about 5-10 dollar and they are easily found in many camera shops near your home.this cord is coiled and tough enough to use at any conditions.but it's not long enough to use long range off-camera flash shooting situation. so if you have a plan to use long range off-camera flash, you'd better buy ""pc extension cord(female-male).""p.s. dont forget this: this cable is only for olympus cameras and it has pc cord tip(male). if you wanna female tip, just buy FL-CB04!!"
1,ONE WHO WOULD KNOW,HEY-WHO EVER SAW JIMMY IN THESE THINGS------I KNOW SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIM AND HE NEVER WORE SOMETHING LIKE THIS! GET REAL.!!!!!!!!!
5,Behold a New Era,"Texas is to the music world, in the present tense, what Seattle was in the late 80's, New York in the late 70's and the U.K.throughout the 60's. In other words, there's an air of creativitiy that cannot be denied.Shearwater,Okkerhill, Centro-Matic, Mandarin, Lift To Experience and now Midlake, who's marvelous debut ""Bamnan & Slivercork"" offers listeners an opportunity to hear the band as they take off on this masterfull debut.Many folks will hear references throughout the disc, (Flaming Lips, Beatles, etc) and granted, these guys borrow from the past.But what they come up with is some of the most exciting stuff being offered in any era.Thank God for folks such as Robin Guthrie (Cocteau Twins) and his U.K. label Bella Union for having the courage and foresight to recognise and sign these guys.Amazingly brilliant and inventive stuff for sure!"
2,Not ideal for thin oils or pocket use,"Works well with thicker (10W40) oils when kept on a workbench, but you probably keep an oil can for that purpose. The unit leaks with thinner penetrating oils (my intended purpose), and you would not want to keep it in a shirt pocket for the same reason. I thought it would work carried in a tool box, but you can't readily tell if it still has oil in it, so you may find yourself out of oil at the job site. I would not buy it again."
3,Precision for What?,"This pen is much larger than one would expect for a ""precision"" oiler. It may be precise for automotive work but it is much too large for office equipment."
3,Size,"I didnt realize the book was so small. If i had known, I wouldn't have purchased it. Dimensions of the product should be displayed."
1,Disappointed,This book is very tiny and boring. The pictures and illustrations are not very interesting. i purchased several Baby Einstein books for my daughter and this is the least interesting.I ordered it because of it good reviews here at Amazon but was very disappointed.
5,A wonderful book.,"This is an utterly facinating story that is treated fairly and presented with immense talent by the author. As it is both a historical record and a love story, it will prove interesting to a variety of readers. Although many people toss the phrase around, this is truly a book that is hard to put down."
2,Disappointed,I bought these Boots at the end of December looking forward to getting to wear them when the first snow came. That day came and I happily put on my new boots. The disappointment came when after the first wear the seam across the tongue split on both boots. exposing the filling. Needless to say my new boots did not prove to be as great as I had expected.
1,steer clear of this water toy!,"Based on the photo of this toy and it's description, one would think that it is a learning toy designed to enhance the user's knowledge of water properities. In reality it consists of a few pieces of styroform, a piece of plastic tubing and some plastic pill bottles. It was a disappointment and the contents of the package could have been purchased for a few dollars at a hardware store, instead of the $20.00 price tag."
2,"Poor, uncomfortable headphones, weak FM reception","I purchased this AIWA because I expected a high quality unit that I could use both for CD and FM radio use. To begin, I'm sure the unit itself is fine. The anti shock system seems to work. But the headphones are of poor quality and don't adjust for larger than childrens' heads. Plus, the FM reception is so poor that even in living in an urban area, I can barely pick up reception from local stations. The reception is so bad that the FM search won't stop on any station. This makes even listening to radio a pain. Apparently the unit utilizes the headphones as an antennae. I wouldn't bother with this CD player."
5,General #04 Steel.,This book move quickly to pull you in to a world of fantasy battles. With the unique mix of old and new technology the story quickly becomes very interesting. Also the use of giant war dogs is just the right twist to really take you off guard. This book and the other is in this series is a must read for a good time.
5,very pleased!,I am very pleased with this collection! Everyone that speaks negatively about the packaging in right! It's really lacking! Definitely expect the dvds to be loose when u receive them. I guess they where trying to cut down on bulk...at least that is what I think. Nevertheless the dvds are fab & even tho they where loose they where not scratched! If ur on the fence...buy this collection! It's totally worth it!
5,Good informatiion in a historical format,I was recommeded this book by a dealer who sells antique native American items. It is the best source for Navajo rugs that I have seen.
5,May God Bless!,It was great being able to watch Red Skelton after so many years. Every Tuesday when I was a child was spent in front of the old black and white TV watching this comic who was as truthful with his jokes as any satirist just funnier. It was and is a pleasure to show this old show with other deceased stars to my kids and their kids.He was one of a kind. Good night and may God bless.
3,Nice set but far from perfect.,I bought this set for about a third of the listed price for that it is worth it but for the listed price you should consider a few things before you buy.The shows are not restored in any way. The B/W shows have about the same quality as public domain DVDs.More disturbing is the B/W shows tend to only have about 22 minutes of content which means 3 minutes of non-commercial content are missing from these shows. And one of the B/W shows was aired when Red was out sick so the entire show consists of Arthur Godfrey interviewing Jackie Gleason. Interesting but why includ a Skelton show that Red was not on. The 23 color shows have better picture quality. These shows comprise the last season of the Skelton show after CBS cancelled Red and NBC picked up the show for one more season.Also as mentioned in an earlier review all 18 discs have been released in other various box sets so if you have any of them I would stay away from this set.
3,"love the clown prince,but","having suffered through many red DVDs that were hardly watchable,i have to ask the question that no one has answered,is this set remastered or restored?if not,why bother?"
5,He's hilarious!,I grew up on Red Skelton. He's just as hilarious as I remembered. I giggled my way through the entire set.
2,not very sturdy,I bought these and they were nice enough but they broke within one week just from trying to take them out and put them in.Also shipping form the seller is an extra 5 bucks.
3,"Decent, could be better","Difficult to clip them together once they are through your ears. A decent product, and I would consider buying them again."
5,GREAT characters and story! Fast read!,I highly recommend this book. It has characters that are well developed and an interesting story. I can't wait to read about the next sister!
1,Refreshing Change of Pace/FIVE STARS,It has to be hard coming up with plots for a regency romance given all the great story lines floating around out there. Behold Julie Anne Long. Her story lines are always a little different and her characters are engaging and multi faceted. Beauty and the Spy is a beautiful love story with plenty of humor and action. Don't miss this one. It will definitely go on my keeper shelf. Can't wait for Sylvie's story!THIS IS A FIVE STAR BOOK. . .NOT ONE. MY MISTAKE!
5,Good Read,"I enjoyed this book. I liked Susannah's development and the hero, Kit, did not frustrate me or make me want to hit him, which is amazing. Many times I want to smack the hero in the book on the head several times. Ha! The villian, Morley, was well, sort of dull? I am not sure quite how to put it. He didn't really DO anything. I suppose that is part of his personality/character though. And the climax was weird...it sort of puffed instead of exploded. But I did like how Richard Lockwood hid the clues, in the ""Christian Virtues."" And the dialogue was witty, I actually chuckled out loud twice. I will definitely be reading Julie Anne Long again."
5,Loved It,"I read a lot of historical romances so it's difficult to impress me. The writing was terrific, the characters believable and sympathetic, the plot intriguing. A very enjoyable read.www.BookWebWarehouse.com"
1,waste of money,"i bought this book against my better judgment at 10.99 its really pricey for any novel but with such great reviews amd a an interesting excerpt i thought why not. instant regret. the hero is not believable as a spy, the heroine is poorly constructed and the dialog is horrible. no the plot isnt believable either but who cares this is fiction for a reason the sequence of events however are poorly put together, nothing flows, its all choppy and i get the feel of reading about children or something children wrote. this is my first book by this author and definately the last. i quit two chapters in ...horrible"
1,"HORRIBLE toy, hurt my baby boy and my daughter!","This is quite possibly the worst design in a toy I've ever seen. It looks really cute until your baby actually plays with it. The ""dump"" feature on the cement truck, causes the whole back of the toy to come crashing down onto the floor. Unfortunately, if a little hand or finger is in the way, it's going to get smashed. My 10 month old son had a red welt across the back of his hand from this happening. My 4 year old daughter played with it and got her finger pinched in the mechanism that makes the cement mixer spin.Neither one of these were major injuries, but there is no reason this toy should have gotten to the public without these issues being addressed! If you own this toy and you're not happy, please call Fisher Price's customer service number and tell them. I did this and they are refunding my purchase price."
2,This product should have a RECALL,"Bought this toy for my 8 m/o son, seemed harmless at first but found that dump section does hold in the up position very well and swings down violently when played with. Although my son hasn't had his fingers under it when it's come down it's bound to happen if he were to play with it unattended. I'd steer clear of this item."
4,Not bad for a 70s post apocalyptic made for TV movie.,It reminded me of Logan's Run. It deals with interesting concepts such as equality and war. I think I'm giving it 4 stars partly out of loyalty to Gene Roddenberry.
4,Genesis II,"I really enjoyed it, it was like my earth II movie. It reminded me of the time in my youth with my parent. Something that I am sharing with my family now."
4,The future is now,I didnt think this was available on dvd.Im glad it is. Its a great movie andi hope everyone has a chance to see itGenesis II
2,Awkened scientist discovered future society,This an unfortunate future society as man named Dylan Hunt under goes his first mission against militaristic dominated city to set free captive men.
5,Breaking Great,The third season continues the gripping story line set up in the first two seasons. Every episode brings a new twist you didn't see coming. Some of the strongest writing on TV today.
5,Amazing,"Season 3 as well as both previous seasons are amazing. And season 4 is even better than any other season. This show continues to wow me. I NEVER react out loud while watching tv or movies, but it seems common for me while watching this. I am so grateful that I discovered this show but at the same time it makes me sad because I know it will be a long time before I see anything as good. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this, however you will probably end up buying season 4 as well because you'll be hooked if you aren't already."
5,Who Is the Baddest Guy In Town?,"The baddest guy in town is the one who plots and plans the best and it turns out that Walt's current meth employer may just be that guy. As we are nearing the end of this season, it is he who is rapidly outflanking just about everyone. Meanwhile, Walt is in chaos as Hank lies in critical condition in the hospital. As usual, he is pulled in all directions at once and can barely keep his nose above the water line. There is a great scene in the hospital where one of these terminator types recognizes Walt and, in a state of instant hatred, crawls on his stumps to try and reach Walt at the hospital door, making big blood patches with each motion forward. This scares Walt to death. Just terrific stuff."
3,A time-filler episode in an otherwise fantastic series,"My wife and I got hooked on Breaking Bad a couple months back and have now downloaded and watched all the episodes from the first three seasons. Since several episodes are fresh in our minds we both noticed that ""Fly"" stood out as a time filler. The episode only features Walter and Jesse and centers around Walt's obsession with killing a fly in his lab that he considers to be ""contamination"". I'm sure there are all sorts of deeper levels of meaning that some people may appreciate, but for us, it was just filler."
5,So Addictive!,"I just loved this season. It is smart, funny, shocking and original. I also loved way the characters develop. The quality of the photography and acting of all the cast make it compelling viewing. Can't wait for the next season.So hurry up with the next season's DVD."
5,Breaking Bad is a great concept and a great Show.... Must See TV!,Breaking Bad is a great concept and a great Show.... Must See TV!Keep the Seasons Coming.... WooHooo!
5,Just as good as seasons 1 & 2,"I will never be able to express how great this show is. The acting is incredible, the writing is magnificent...every season is the best of the best!"
5,The second times the charm,Love the show but I was on the edge of my seat waiting for this to arrive and the first shipment just dropped off the world. The tracking did not update and no dvd was forthcoming. I used Amazon customer service and they sent out a replacement right away.
5,breaking bad 3rd season,this season of breaking bad is awesome if you haven't saw it yet then it is a must you should buy or rent seasons 1&2 they are great you WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED !
1,Skip this episode,there are some very minor developments in here like we learn about walt but in the end its a wash. This is by far the worst episode in the seriesspoiler: in the end they kill the house fly!
4,Breaking Bad,"Suspenseful, thrilling and difficult to quite watching. Very worthwhile, can't wait for Season 4 to arrive in the ned few days"
1,breaking broke,The video had quite a hard time to connect and load. I finally gave up on it.Wish I could get my refound
5,Season 3,"The writers of this series are excellent and take the viewer into the mind of a once gentle, somewhat cowardly yet brilliant chemistry teacher that as time goes on slowly undergoes metamorphosis into a cold blooded killer who will do anything to ascend his personal ladder of power."
5,"Possibly the best season of any show, ever.","I've been talking this season up to everyone I know who shows even the slightest bit of interest. The season starts off great with the introduction of the Cousins and ends with a bang. The acting is second to none, the characters are so realistic it's easy to think of them as real people. The gritty realism of meth production is balanced with a dark sense of humor(Bob Odenkirk has never been better than as sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman) and action scenes that rival the best you've seen in any movie. Do yourself a favor and watch Season 3 of Breaking Bad. The first season was good, but cut short by the writers' strike. The second season was great in its own right- but this is a whole new level, taking its characters places you never would have imagined. Key episodes: No Mas, One Minute, Half Measures, Full Measure."
5,One of the most tense sequences in TV history,"I'm very glad my friends turned me on to breaking bad, as the show starts pretty well, and only seems to get better. But I have to say that the episode One Minute is one of the best of the series, and features one of the top 2 or 3 most harrowing scenes I've ever seen on a TV show. I was absolutely frozen watching the last minute of this episode."
2,Total disappointment,"What was that? We just finished the 3rd and final bluray of season 3 and cant believe how bad and diappointing this season was. We loved each single episode of the previous two but this is ridiculous... while some episodes are ok, most are not and some are total let-downs (The Fly? Get out of here...). And the final 'cliffhanger'...pu-lease!!! Not a happy camper and will approach next season with caution..."
3,only OK,"I totally loved the first two seasons, but this one was rather weak. I did not buy a lot of the plot and story as well as the erratic behavior of the characters. I almost did not care if I finished this season. Rather disappointing..."
2,Quite surprised at the direction,"I sure am in the minority here because most reviews are extremely positive. But BB has taken a strange turn this 3rd season. We just watched it to prepare for the new Season 4 and we are disappointed. Walt is moving off on a tangent, Jessie is more broody and quiet than ever, and the brother-in-law issues are just getting in the way of what began for 2 solid seasons as a show that stayed on a tried-and-true track."
1,Can't watch it,"I bought this product form Spain and I can't watch it as it belongs to a different region, they should have warned me about it..."
4,Uncut version,"Got Season's One and Two. Was a bit surprised at the uncut version of these shows. Thought would be like TV version. Would prefer such. Otherwise, good product."
5,crazy show - awesome acting - great deal,If you are a fan of this series - and if you watch just one episode you will be hooked - this is a must-have so you can watch and stop action and go back and forth! LOVE Breaking Bad!!
4,If youre thinking about buying these DO IT!,"This is such a tremendous show, I really recommend it to anyone looking for an adventurous romp in TV heaven. An AMC Originals drama (created by Vince Gilligan) with great action, (dark) comedy, and lots of suspense. The download quality is a little 'off' on my laptop, but that may just be my connection of outdated Flash player. I have a lot of fun following Walt ""Heisenberg"" White on his adventures as he tries to piece together a life that makes sense despite many disturbing setbacks. The direction is A++ and also an interesting cultural study of the American southwest and drug/Latino/cop culture. Season 3 is no let down, so pony up the cash and enjoy :)"
4,Solid writing and entertaining.,This series is entertaining drama in spite of the dark subject matter. I am looking forward to watching season 4.
5,Truly great entertainment,"Breaking Bad is such a well-written, well-acted show. Season three is just as good as 1 & 2. Well worth the money."
1,No English Subtitles? Seriously?,Warning to anyone like my self with a serious hearing problem (or if you're full-on deaf): season three has NO English subtitles/closed captioning. Which is extra frustrating seeing as the first two seasons DO have subtitles. It's a fantastic series and the fact that AMC would skimp on such a basic feature is ridiculous.
1,PAL is not my friend,"I have eagerly devoured the first two seasons of Breaking Bad. Imagine my disappointment when I put the first disc of Season 3 in my Blu-Ray player only to get the message that the disc is not playable. Why? It's a PAL disc, incompatible with a Region 1 DVD player. Nothing on the packaging or the Amazon listing hinted that this was a PAL version. Thanks for nothing, WAREHOUSE DEALS, INC.Am I going to get flamed for reviewing the seller and not the product? Sorry, but the only option for a review I saw was this one, so if there is a way to give a demerit to Warehouse Deals and not this exceptional series, please let me know. Breaking Bad: A+; Warehouse Deals: D."
1,WARNING: REGION LOCKED,"I live in Europe and I just spend more than $ 100 (including customs) on the Breaking Bad seasons 1, 2 and 3. Unfortunately I can't play them. However, this information is nowhere to be found. Not on Amazon, not on the box, not on the internet-database. The only way to find out is after spending a lot of money and putting the disc in the player. You get a screen which says to look on the box for more information. However, there is no information to be found anywhere. Supposedly Sony recently started to make their discs region locked without warning."
5,Still brilliant and getting darker all the time,"This show is brilliantly bleak, occasionally humorous, and still provocative. Walt may be in remission, but his life as a meth cook is ever more complicated, with more bad and deadly people getting involved, Jesse dealing with a support group and his constant temptations to do the wrong things for money, Skyler finding out what her husband has been up to, and the brother in law being seriously injured after coming close to finding out just who Heisenberg really is.Bryan Cranston is a stone-cold genius, and the cast is equally impressive. Great soundtrack too."
5,friggin amazing!,"all I can say is the series on a whole is an absolute work of art, on so many levels."
5,Don't miss out! Hot Body always delivers!!,Those of you who have grown up with Hot Body videos know exactly what to expect. Beautiful women in a softcore adult dvd. Full frontal and even closeups. The sad thing is that Hot Body is no longer producing new dvd's or VHS tapes and the prices are actually starting to rise. Check out ebay for some ridiculous bidding on Hot Body VHS tapes. When you find dvd's for less than $17 snatch them up. There aren't many out there and Sneaky Preview 67 is definitely one to grab.
2,Lacking in content & in credibility,"As hopeful as I was for this book ,I found it lacking both in content & in credibility. Far too many pages are devoted to trying to prove that Nordic (or Asatru) & Finnish are closely related due to archetype-overlap (Ukko & Odin), and far too few are devoted to the qualities of Finnish magic which would make its practice unique. The suggested trancing methods in the book, while viable, are associated with Finnish belief by weak inference rather than by historical precedence. The suggestions on how to pronounce Finnish words are grossly inaccurate & inadequate."
4,Good Bag,"I use this bag for hauling all my kids Little League gear. The wheels are a must and work great. Lots of pockets for my managerial paperwork, etc. Great value. Glad I bought it and will use it for years to come."
4,Beautiful Product,I embossed an Art Box with the product and it looks great. If you like a Gold Leaf look that's more than that this stuff is great! My only problem with it is its very delicate and takes patience to apply. This is just the nature of the product. This is also great for embossing with a glue pen on regular paper or cardboard but can leave smudges on photo papers where regular embossing foils wont. I like the look of the Red Veriegated leaf the best.
2,Misrepresented,"This item is misrepresented, in that the sports pouch was not included. It does not have a lap counter, or a stop-watch. It does not have the capability to switch from jazz, rock, or whatever else it said it would do. I am very disappointed. I went so far as to ask for another player in hopes that these issues would be resolved. Unfortunately, I got the same player, still with no sports pouch."
5,Sons favorite thing,My son got this for christmas along with lots of other.... much more expensive toys and this was his very favorite. He loves pretending to cut trees down with it and has even slept with it in his bed LOL !!! Absolutely a great toy for him...(5 years old) however it is heavy duty and they need to know not to hit anything with it that breakable.... it is made out of hard plastic not foam like other tous of this nature.
3,Does what it says,It is hollow so it is easy to bend the handle if you are not careful. It is an alright toy all in all though.
3,It's a plastic axe.,I got the plastic axe I was expecting. Cool huh? I need more words to flesh out this review. Axe!
5,Boys love it,"I needed this as a prop in a class that I teach with many impulsive middle school aged boys, so needless to say, a plastic axe was the way to go! I had to put it away because they play with it so much. It served the process and was a lot of fun. Bigger than I expected."
4,ok for play,my son wanted this for christmas to go with his play fire man costum and is always hitting things with it pretending he is knocking doors down and such so far just a little dents that can be popped out of the plastic.
5,Golf My Way,Product arrived as described. Would purchase again. Good quality VHS tape on golf; shipped via good quality packing and arrived on timely basis.
2,If you need some sleep,"Jack's golf my way video was really boring. i mean it put me to sleep. The video showed too many angles, and was put together in such a way that did not add much interest to the film. the video, however, did show how to hit the ball and the correctangles that are necessary for proper ball contact. overall, i was not too impressed with this one"
4,Bad for baking - but great for soap making,"This silicone pan is too short, thin, and flimsy for baking, but I bought it along with other cheapy silicone pans to pour homemade soap into, which is great as the soap comes out easy when it has hardened. So, bad for cakes, but good for soap."
1,This toy STINKS!,"My husband bought this toy for my son because he loves parachutes. There are no instructions on how to attach the parachute to the action figure and no plausible way of doing it. The parachute is of pretty good quality, but if it cannot be attached to the toy or CANNOT BE USED AS A PARACHUTE it is useless and frustrating and disappointing to a little boy AND his father!!! The quality of the accessories is very cheap also, since the gun and scope fall apart if touched."
4,I love Peg !!,"""All Aglow Again"" is super!! I especially like the Bock-Harnick ""Where Do I Go From Here"" from ""Fiorello!"" The more Peggy Lee I can get the better!!! She's incredible!!"
1,Beware of this reprint!,"This Nabu reprint is from an 1875 Shaker hymnal. But it was printed in the wrong format. Instead of being in oblong shape like the original hymnal, it is printed like a regular hymnbook so all the pages are cut off on the right or left side. Therefore, none of the text or music is complete. Who can sing these hymns and songs when they are missing the beginning or end of the music? Didn't anyone look at this hymnal before it was reprinted? This cheaply printed Nabu reprint should not be sold by Amazon or anyone else in its present incorrect format. Buyer Beware!"
4,"Great for Post Surgery, very soft and comfortable","This worked great for my post surgery recover. However the cover was not as well made as I would have liked, but great for short term use."
1,wrong cord,"We purchased the 1.8M thin apple firewire cable 4-6 pin on a recommendation to connect our Sony Handycam DCR-HC28 to our Macbook Pro. The cable connects to the camcorder, but not to our Mac. Apparently we need a 9-pin for our computer port? Still trying to figure out what we need."
5,Serene Liquid Light!,"Of all the music I have used and have listened to, for using during my Reiki sessions, this is by far my favorite. Serene liquid light! I set the CD player to Repeat-All and let it play! All too often, Reiki CD's seem to be a tad jumpy, a bit jarring, tho of the 'new age' ilk...this CD allows the mind to wander where it will, where the Reiki treatment takes it, instead of 'dictating' where the mind will go...It lifts the mind and lets it float, instead of jerking or slinging it around. Obviously Mr Oliver understands both Music and Reiki. Buy it, you'll like it! I'm buying my second copy for a backup!"
3,Pretty good read.,"Yes, the writer throws her entire mental lexicon at us. Did i care really?? Not so much. It doesn't take away from the story line, and even if there were words I had never heard in my life the contexual clues help you out. This book is a great start for an interesting fantasy read. I would have given the book more stars except for one nagging point. When a writer starts out with such an interesting character and world, I expect a little more. The main character jumped around a lot in the first book, and a lot of critical events got crammed into a single binding. However, it truly is an original concept and the sheer fact that I really wanted to know so much more about the underlying mysteries really pulled this book along well."
2,it could have been so much better....,"This series had an intriguing story, its just to bad that the writing was so poor...."
4,Coze little book to read,"The Ill-Made Mute is a very entertaining book although I have to say that sometimes the writer gets a little side tracked with the details, all in all I really enjoyed it and I'm sure you will too."
1,Not good.. not good at all,"I am shaking my head in bewilderment at all the rave reviews here. I have never had such a hard time reading a book. I felt like I was forcing myself through never-ending sludge. The author certainly proves she has an expansive vocabulary and a wild imagination, but her style is anything but engrossing. After 100 pages I couldn't care less about the characters or storyline. I do not recommend buying this book. It was not what I expected at all."
1,Unbelievably bad.,The first 39 pages of this book are utterly dire. I simply do not understand all the glowing reviews. The level of the writing is about what you'd expect from extremely pretentious internet fan fiction written by a dungeons and dragons player who wished to show off her vocabulary. Totally unnecessary metaphors and descriptions detracted from any interest or merit the story might have. Whether it improved after the first 39 pages I can't say as I just couldn't force myself to continue with it. I only regret that I didn't give up after the first page.
3,Too long winded to be any good,"This book has received quite a few good reviews, and I can understand why - It is a very good story after all - BUT the sad thing is it is wrapped up in waaaay too many meaningless and drawn-out descriptions of absolutely everything. Is there a chair in a room? Ten to one it'll be described in excrutiating detail. This makes the story drag at the most important part - the beginning. The only reason I slogged through the rest and found a good story was because I always finish books I buy. Not everyone does that, and most will be put off by the exceptionally boring start, and how over-described it is."
3,Much study to get intangled in words,"Dont miss understand me, this is a very nice book, very relaxing, you can see the author studied very well legends and books on fairy kingdom and inhabitants, but she does get intangled a bit in her own words and worlds, getting lost at some points between the drama and her studies, it is anyway a facinating kind of writing, and an ideal for relax after a stressfull day, but i did find myself skipping some parts of the book beacause it made me loose interest. The second book of the series is much nicer, the third has not yet been released in italy so i cannot say, but, if you ar looking for a nice pure fantasy book and some nice legends ( the author puts many in the book from Irish and english tradition), this is a nice book, if u are looking for a fantasy book you cannot put down, choose another one."
5,The I'll Made Mute,The series of the books are great and I can not wait for the third book The Battle of Evernight to come out. I congratulate you on such a terrific series in which I have become an avid fan and would like a copy of the third addition as soon as possible.
1,purple prose alert,"I expected to love this book. The cover art was lovely, the blurb on the back interesting and compelling, the reviews mostly glowing. I reread parts of it in the hope I'd suddenly see what so many others see in it...but that failed. So, with apologies, because I don't like to put down Australian fantasy authors, I have to say that this book contains some of the purplest prose I can remember reading. And one sentence actually made me laugh aloud - not a good thing in a passage which is intended to be anything but humorous. I'll quote it here. If you like it, read the book. If you laugh, don't.""Caught between the mortar of daily drudgery and the pestle of pain, life went grinding on.""It even uses alliteration, as if the metaphor wasn't strained enough.On the other hand, it's always good to smile, right?"
1,"verbose, slow","After reading the reviews in the inside cover, I started this book with high hopes. However this book appears to be more of an attempt to show how clever and broad the author's vocabulary is rather than tell a good story. For the first hundred pages or so I read out words to my wife to see if she knew them (she didn't), but finally got tired of the author trying to make me feel stupid. Since my wife and I both have university degrees and read continously, I can only wonder what a struggle this book must be for many.I've read Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Tolkien, but no author has made me reach for the dictionary like Ms Dart-Thornton. In the end it distracted from the story too much - intricate detail about nothing is how I'd describe the book. No tension, no character development, little plot.... but LOTS of poetic description.Colin."
4,The book I found boring at first but thrilling in the end,The Ill-Made Mute was for me quite boring at first. I didn't want to finish it because it hadn't drawn me in at all. But when I got to the end I couldn't put it down. The second book in the series was even better and this is a must read series! Thank you for reading my review!..
3,Could be titled 'The bait & switch',"The Ill-Made Mute isn't a terrible book, and I did buy the entire trilogy so it clearly worked on some level, but it's also not the book that you think it is from the blurb or from the first few chapters.It's not a fantasy trilogy so much as a chick-lit wish fulfilment trilogy in a fantasy setting. It starts out tremendous: the soaring tower, the strange magic/technology, the unloved and unlovely hero, and for the first few chapters it seemed like a serious new fantasy writer had arrived.But before you know it you aren't in Tolkein anymore and are instead reading a sub-standard romance with a devastatingly beautiful heroine who isn't half so interesting and who's biggest problem seems to be that every man she meets falls madly in love with her."
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"I was recommended this book by a number of people, and was disappointed that it was not nearly as good as I expected. The storyline and the characters were interesting enough to make me finish the book, and I liked the way familiar fairy tales were threaded through the book (there were a lot of ""Oh, I know that one!"" moments). It was just so damned WORDY. Every change of scene was accompanied by exhaustively detailed descpriptions, and there were many changes of scene. I admit to being a reader who prefers action and conversation to description, so if you don't share that bias you might really love it. If you do share my bias, be prepared!"
2,The Ill-Made Book,"I love fantasy, when it's well-done, but this is apalling. While the main character is engaging at the first, the rest is extremely repetitive, with enough figurative language to choke a bard. However, were it not for all the reptition and figurative language, the book would only be fifty pages long. Also, she takes the convention of inventing new words for the new world too far, and as a result, it is extremely hard to read. Moreover, any interest the main character generates at the beginning is quickly lost when first Truth is discovered, as it becomes a matter of stereotyping, rather than playing with the rather role-reversals that could have been. If you are very hard-pressed for good fantasy, hold out but a little until something better can be found!"
4,While a good series....,"Cecilia Dart-Thornton's ""The Bitterbynde"" trilogy is one of imense passion. It draws the reader in and keeps them interested until the very end. However, the ending of the thrid book, ""The Battle of Evernight"" is somewhat dissapointing as it does not tell you what exactly happens. You are left with no real idea if Ashalind is ever reunited with her true love Angavar-Thorn. It does have the quality of making the reader think that perhaps there will be a sequel to the book telling of what happens to Ashalind.Overall, the trilogy is definatly one of the better ones to read and can be compared in quality to the series of Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Traci Harding, Ian Irving or even the master himself, Tolkien."
1,Convoluted,"This book was highly recommended to me, and perhaps that is part of the reason I was disappointed. The world-building is interesting, but because of the convoluted style, I couldn't really enjoy it."
2,Good and Bad,"The story was good. But unfortunately, it was hard to find it. The writing style of the Ill Made Mute is by far the most annoying that I have ever read. The writer's ""voice"" was very clunky, and I noticed the writing early and often. Cecilia Dart-Thornton constantly pulls you away from the story to announce, ""Here I am! I am a writer, and this is my style!"" I am an avid reader of fantasy, and the best leaves you with a story. I have never noticed the writing style of Tolkien, King or Lewis. (among many others) But you will notice the writing style of this author. It is like biting into a hamburger and tasting spinach, lemon juice, garlic and figs."
1,Lots of fuss over very little,"I really just don't get the fuss. So far this year this is the most mediocre book I've bothered finishing. And the only reason I finished is because a friend recommended it. I ended up skimming huge chunks just to get through it.The plotting was transparent. With perhaps two exceptions I could pretty much tell what was going to happen. Boring.The characterization was nonexistent. The heroine had no personality, the hero was perfect and had no personality, the secondary characters were archetypes. Boring.The world building was thrown at you in undigestible chunks at the beginning. A good author weaves the world seamlessly into the plot, IMO.And how hokey - she gets a normal face and doesn't know if she's ugly or pretty <eye roll>. And worst of all, this book ends in the middle of nowhere. It. Just. Ends. ARGH!!If I hadn't gotten this book from the library and had actually paid full cover price for it I would be frothing at the mouth."
1,Australian SF Reader,"I could not make myself finish this. Horribly twee, with too much forced floweryness. You could give it a rating of 5 florids out of 5, perhaps! Anyway, it is possible younger girls may enjoy this, but for a fantasy of kid hidden away, must escape and do great things after being a servant, then it is pretty easy to find dozens of more worthwhile books, whether for young people or adults."
5,I second that...,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This album defies genres. It's all over the place: jazz, funk, soul, hip-hop. Open your mind and enjoy this one. Medidate, smoke a joint, drink a few brews...do whatever you have to do to open your mind and let this one go straight to your head. You won't regret it. Really feeling the track ""We Ourself & Us."" That's the highlight for me. ""Spacey hip-hop grooves"" is just a few words I could use to describe this song. Dig it."
3,Simple enjoyment,"The Journals is a good book for beginners. It is very easy reading, lighter and easier to understand than most of the spiritual books. Entertaining for a change. Not mucked down by the weightiness of this subject. I enjoyed it in a simplistic sort of way. There isn't deep insight as one would suspect by the title, however, I look forward to Part II to rest my heart and soul."
5,Excellent book for teens and adults,"This book was amazing. Easy to read and short chapters. As a parent of two teenagers, I thought it had a lot to offer my kids and myself as well. I am also a High School Youth Group sponsor, so I spend a lot of time in the teen world. Today's society spends all it's time telling our kids to think only of themselves. This book challenges them to think beyond themselves and put God first."
2,Don't buy it,"My 13 year old daughter has been reading this book for school and has had a very difficult time with it. She is a voracious reader but this books lacks clarity and continuity and had been very hard to follow. Read something better by John Piper, JI Packer - something of substance."
2,not what I expected,The book is geared towards a teen audience. I was expecting it to be for adults.
2,Temperature Off,"I received this thermometer free, and I have found the temperature to be off. Just now I held four different thermometers at room temperature, and this one was five degrees off of the rest. It may be usable in case of thermometer emergency, but I would not depend on it."
2,Short Life,"This thermometer worked fine for about 6 months, but then would read nothing but ""HIGH"" with the probe in it . . . and seemingly normal with the probe removed. I'm guessing the probe went bad, and of course the probes are $12.00 by themselves . . .not a very good deal, and not available from Amazon. I'll give it 2 stars for being nice while it lasted."
2,"Worked great, twice.","First time I used it, it worked great. The probe when out on the second time. Emailed the company and got no response back. I guess they need to ship about 5 probs with each one. Not recommend."
2,TEMP WAY OFF,I LIKE THIS THERMOMETER EXCEPT THAT THE TEMP IS WAY OFF. I CAN GET IT TO READ 160 TO 170 DEG. JUST HOLDING IT IN MY HAND. ALSO CHECKED IT AGAINST ANOTHER THERMOMETER ON A ROAST IN MY SMOKER AND IT READS WAY TO HOT. I WILL CONTACT THE MFG. TO SEE HOW THEY HANDLE THIS AND LET YOU KNOW.
1,Hope you have piloting experience,"The controls take forever to learn there are like 100 of them, basically every key on your keyboard, and then they treat it like WW2 dogfighting but with spaceships and the voice overs are really ..."
4,Unique and Surprising Look at Early American Life,"The title's reference to a sexual revolution may be somewhat of a misnomer, but Godbeer provides exceptional insight into what Puritans thought, said and did sexually. Godbeer provides ample evidence to debunk the view of Puritans is the dour uptight anti-sexual stereotype, a view largely created in the 19th century by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The Puritans explicitly rejected the ""Papist"" viewpoint that sex was evil and should only be done for procreation. Godbeer also explores Anglo-Indian sexual relations and post-revolutionary mores.Godbeer shows that the sexuality of early Americans was far more complex than the barren stereotypes suggest."
5,a vivid window on early American sexuality,"This is a very readable and yet sophisticated look at what early Americans thought about sex. It covers the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, also ranges from New England through the southern colonies. It's full of insightful comments about attitudes to gender as well as sex, including what we now call homosexuality and the links between religious belief and sexual values. The author recognizes his debt to earlier scholars (despite what the other reviewer writes), but contributes much that is new and important to our knowledge of this topic. A great read and an important book!"
3,"Interesting, valuable but misleading","Edmund Morgan has said it best: valuable research, interesting conclusions which add to our knowledge, but hardly a sexual revolution. It is unfortunately that to be politically/sexually correct in academia and to sell books the author has had to misrepresent what he has accomplished."
4,A great local band,This is a great punk/screamo band. Straight out of Washington.BUY THIS ALBUM!!! Or face the wrath of our gang!
2,Is that all?????,"After seeing The Incredibles we purchased the Incredobile for him for his birthday. It has to be one of the most disappointing toys I have seen in a long time. Mr. Incredible does flip from ""normal"" to ""super"" and there are firing missiles that come out of the headlights but little more excitement than that. The action figure is difficult for my 4 year old to remove or put in by himself so I spend much of my time doing that for him. The missiles will fire across the room making them difficult to find and my son has already pulled off the headlight/missle covers several times. You can put them back on but they shouldn't come off so easily! The missles have to be put back in a certain way which takes some fine motor skills that he hasn't developed yet. It's only been a day and my son is still interested in it but I know that will soon fade. I'm sure the missles will be MIA in a few days as well. If you want to spend money on an Incredibles toy skip this one. It's pretty boring."
2,Disappointment,"Wish I would have visited the movie- makers Store and purchased their remote control Incredobile with an action figure you can remove, but I saw it too late. It looked much better than this one. I agree with the first reviewer- my son just turned 5- he cannot put in or take out the action figure by himself- PLUS he pinched his finger while trying to push in the turbo thing- badly- got a blood blister! The turbo thing is very tricky- you have to push it numerous times before it will stay in (this operates the changing feature)-I am contemplating taking it back. He says"" I like it but it doesn't work very good."""
4,My child really liked the Incredibles Incredobile,This toy was great especially for the price. My son loves playing with it and switching the men from Bob Parr to Mr. Incredible.
4,Mr. Incredible Changing Car,"My 4 1/2 year old boy loves this toy. He plays with it every day and takes Mr. Incredible with in the car.The toy isn't made really durable. It tends to get stuck trying to convert the action figures. But, my son still enjoys playing with it so I am glad I purchased it. I am glad it wasn't expensive, because it is not worth a lot of money."
3,Ehhh,"my son wanted this toy, so I got it. He was happy to receive it, but it lacks play value, and it is really ignored after its reception."
4,Most of the mysteries are connected...,"This book is a great compilation of Miss Marple mysteries. The last mystery, ""The Body in the Library"" is a prequel of sorts to the first mystery, ""The Mirror Crack'd"".The middle three mysteries are also connected in certain ways and seem to follow each other in order.I enjoyed that. Miss Marple is really amazing, and shows us that just because you get older doesn't mean you have to sit around doing nothing! Her brain is sharper than most 20 year olds!"
5,A Bargain,We watched a video of The Mirror Crack'd but could not figure out the plot. We were so frustrated we ordered a copy of the novel. As a bonus we got 4 other novels. The book cleared up what was really fuzzy in the video. And we have 4 more novels to enjoy. Not bad!
4,An aid to meditation and relaxation,"Tom Kenyon is a shaman who helps us reach deeper states of relaxation through his recordings. To listen to his work is to find yourself sinking effortlessly into meditative, healing phases of consciousness.This collection is invaluable.Buying this set gives you four CDs; each includes tracks that will help you achieve different types of meditation. The four categories are: relaxation, performance, creativity, and health. My personal favorite is called ""Dream Mentor,"" on the creativity CD, which never fails to gently lull me into restful sleep.If you are interested in meditation to facilitate relaxation, mental performance, creativity, or physical health, this set contains material that will help! Also try Soma by Tom Kenyon.The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the cost. If these CDs were sold separately I would have bought Relaxation and Creativity. In any case I recommend this set."
1,Hunting from home or fishing or looking at trees from home?!,The title of the book is deceiving. I purchased the book thinking it was about hunting. Shame on me for not reading any on-line reviews first. I purchased the book at a book store while on vacation and was looking for a good read on large game hunting and bird hunting. The book was more focused on fishing in Russia and the Blue Ridge Mountains and how he (Chris Camuto) watched and heard the logging trucks thin out an area that he liked to hike into and camp for a few days. If you like to read about HUNTING!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!
4,Kel-Tec grip extension,I like it be cause it give me a longer surface to grip and makes the pistol much easier to hold and handle
2,Wasn't as described,Extension didn't fit the pistol that it described it would. Have to return it for the 380 instead of the 45 that was sent.
5,The fix for big hands,"This little item is great for bigger hands or those that want to have their full hand on the gun. It also helps hold the gun with less flip so your able to obtain the second shot faster. Great little item,I sold my Glock 27 because the grip was just too small but with my new gun and this it is perfect for concealed carry."
4,Great Toy,"Kids love this movie, and everything to do with it. I bought one for my nephew, one for a 4 year old male little friend of ours, and one for my 3 & 7 year old daughters... They all love it! Our friend even carried it around, and was saying how he was real... because he was so big! Too cute!"
3,Cute but bad voice,"Mr. Incredible's voice was disappointing when my son played with him. It didnt sound like the movie at all. Be careful too, it scratches easily. Overall its cute but no big deal."
4,Mine was damaged.,Purchased from toys-r-us and it came damaged. Too much of a hassle to return. He is very loud and the harder you push on him the louder he gets!
5,Buy it.......Its Worth,"I bought this toy for my son who is 11 months old. He is enjoying while playing with this toy and imitating Mr. Incredible.Logan, CA"
2,Finger hurts from having to press button,The toy looks great. The chest expands and his mouth opens wide when he shouts. But you have to press the button multiple times to even get him to say one full saying. The button is hard to push as it is. I will be returning this item.
3,a good one,"my 2 and 5 year old like it extremely the day they received it, but not for very long time. The toy was left in the toy basket now."
4,Pretty kinda Incredible!,"Totally Mr. Funster, Mr. Incredible is funny, tough, self-deprecating, and never flubs his lines."
2,"Fun for role play, but not high quality","The button is difficult to push, and my son complained his finger started hurting. You have to hold the button down to have Mr. Incredible finish the statement.My son enjoys playing with him, but also really likes his Happy Meal toy Mr. Incredible just as much."
3,"Book was in good shape, not very good.","the book was in good shape not ""very good"". Besides that, the price was good and I recieved the book in only a couple days."
5,A Must Read!,"This is an excellent companion for any Magic: The Gathering player, as well as a sound fantasy novel for fans of the genre. With excellent writing and a deep, intricate plot, this is one of the best books in the series."
3,Pretty Good Book,"This book was pretty good,... I felt that this novel was very choppy. Years would pass all of a sudden, leaving you to wonder what happened during that period of time. I'd lose interest sometimes, leaving the book to sit for weeks before picking it back up again. Despite these faults, I really liked the concept of the ""Alliance"" of races, and I thought the battles were well written. I'm glad Yavamaya finally got some attention as well. Hopefully Bloodlines will keep my attention better."
4,Great for Deer Hunters,"I bought this for my husband, who does not like to read at all. To my surprise, he loved the book! He said the author did a great job on explaining the process of hunting deer from A to Z. He said that some of the book was information he had heard before, but the rest was interesting details he never would have thought of! I think it turned out to be a great gift!"
5,5/5 and this is why...,This is a great book to just read in general. It does get repetitive at certain points but it does cement the basic knowledge you need to know when bagging a B&C buck. Great read if you're a hunter or just an avid reader.
4,A good reference for the poet,"I use this book to send submissions of my poetry to various magazines. The biggest help has been in introducing me to magazines that are not available at your average bookstore. The other thing is that I had no idea of the format of a submission before I first picked this book up. I have at least gotten read a couple of times, even if I did get rejection slips. Don't let this book scare you. There's so much information here that it's a little overwhelming. I have the 2001, but I would recommend buying the latest edition. You might even want to wait and buy the 2003. Also, hang in there. Being a poet in 2002 is a little difficult I know."
1,Cord Doesn't work,I received the product quickly as promised.But the cord does not seem to work. I assumed it would be a simple plug and play procedure. Yet the computers do not recognize the presence of another connected computer or even the cord.Could be a dud?
4,Intrigue,The society of Japan is one that is absolutely fascinating and certainly one that is worth studying. This book presents an anthropological outlook that is easily understood yet is well written.
1,Not very authentic at all,"There are many mistakes in this book. The following is an excerpt from my letter to the publisher. There were at least five other description mistakes that I counted in this book:""This is the last item on my list, but it is the most important because it involves an old stereotype that just is not correct: I cannot think of one contemporary Japanese family, cosmopolitan or rural, where the father would not grant a wish of his daughter's to have a carp streamer for Kodomo no Hi. Frankly, I am worried and offended that such a ""Mr. Miyagi"" (or maybe ""Meeyahghee"" if the author spelt it) type, a cultural dinosaur, is depicted (wrongly at that) in a book for children introducing Japanese culture. I am disappointed by the lack of more thorough research by the author."""
5,Fascinating historical novel,"Inspiring Scottish heroes, cruel English villains, a courageous uprising, and a secret tunnel will draw readers of all ages into this engaging story. We first meet an immature fourteen-year-old Duncan M'Kethe as he is, in his father Sandy's terms, ""playacting"" rather than watching their sheep. However, increasing oppression of Presbyterian families like Duncan's forces peace-loving Sandy M'Kethe, along with his son, into a bloody conflict that ends in disaster. Duncan must grow up quickly as he sees the price others have paid for their devotion to the Covenant and Jesus, the only true Head of the Church. And in the end he must take an extreme risk to keep his father from paying that same price. Infused with historical fact, ""Duncan's War"" makes us believe, for a short time, that we are truly in early Scotland. And it accurately depicts the struggles our predecessors faced to follow Christ."
2,Interferes with WiFi,"This concept of this product is what I wanted but after using, there are two major issues I encountered.1. If you have a wireless network in your home, it knocks it off. Could not figure why my WiFi (N) was going down. After unplugging the camera, my WiFi came back up. Did it several time to be sure. It was definitely the transmitter on the camera. My wireless home network is ""N"", not sure if this problem will be the same for the B/G wireless networks.2. The second issue i had was after turning the power on for the DVR and press ""Record"" I have to format the memory card every time. So if you have recording that you want to save, you will have to use a different memory card.The system works OK but if you can deal with the two issues above, it will work for you.Hopes this helps with your purchase.Thanks"
5,Strehler's glorious 1980 Paris Figaro recaptured.,"An elegant, traditional production of great visual beauty. The singers and orchestra are excellent. The blu-ray picture brings out clever facial expressions with a clarity that would be impossible in the opera house. (The careless subtitles are the only negative)."
1,Poor remembrance for a memorable playoffs,"The 2011 playoffs was loaded with storylines: Dallas vs. Miami part 2; ""Not one, not two, not three....""; Dirk and Lebron's chase for their first championship; Dallas as comeback kings; ""Coughgate"" and Phil's last stand among others. Yet this DVD manages to water down the 2011 NBA playoff saga into an uninspiring mash-up of rehashed game and interview clips (most of which had been shown on ESPN) and bland narrative.I'm a huge Mavs fan but after watching this, all I can say is ""There's nothing to see here"". Buy a championship shirt or hat. You'll get more from those than from this video."
5,The best ever!,"These are excellent! They open up the Book of Revelation like none ever has. Actually, it helps one to understand the Bible even more. Genesis and Revelation, the beginning and the end, make the Bible, God's speaking to His creation, open up like you've never seen. God has a plan and Genesis and Revelation encompass it. Everything in between, which leads to the consummation of the age, becomes more clear and Real. A must read!"
1,I can not easily determine the version covered,Orcad is up to something like Version 10.3Therfore I will not buy it
1,"Not funny, just whiny and miserable.","I'm pretty sure Ms. Shapiro fancied herself the next Vicki Iovine (author of the Girlfriend's Guides books) as she wrote this book. However, I found her to be far off the mark.While Vicki's perspective is down and dirty, her writing is fundamentally infused with a great sense of compassion, generosity, and warm humor. Ms. Shapiro, on the other hand, just comes across as whiny and miserable.As a new Mother myself, I'm currently dealing with the many ways nursing can be challenging, maddening, and downright weird. I would have gladly laughed along with Ms. Shapiro as she documents her trials. The problem is: I couldn't hear her laughing. Frankly, I just ended up feeling sorry for her. I didn't find this book funny OR inspiring OR hopeful. I'll stick with the Girlfriends Guides in the future."
2,How her breasts bored the world,"This book starts out promisingly, then degenerates into an ordinary (and rather dull) personal journal. I am a nursing mother of a 2 month old, and was intrigued by the subject, but disappointed by the book.I'm with the other reviewers who said that the author comes across as braggy and self-absorbed. Slogging through repeated accounts of how fat she looked and what she wore was tedious at best.Also, maybe I'm a dork, but I kept wondering how she would tie the title of the book in with her story. She doesn't."
5,FINALLY!,"Finally! A book that really lets you know what being a new breastfeeding mother is all about. I could not stop laughing. Lisa Wood Shapiro is not afraid to tell it like it REALLY is. I felt like she was reading my mind. I am so glad she didn't candy coat her experience or pretend that she had a huge epiphany at the end. Just like childbirth,the emotions we feel as new mothers are sometimes messy. This book felt to me like it was real. Is that so much to ask for nowadays?"
1,"done at 6 months, too!","After about 6 months of great performance, this ""joggable"" is gone. Skip, skip, skip. I'm back to the old cassette player until I try another ""sport friendly"" cd player. I've been loyal to Aiwa from past experiences. However, it's time for another brand."
4,Terrific Portable CD,"I wasn't so impressed with this player until I used THEIR earphones. Some of the best for this type of equipment. If the player lasts longer than the Sony players I've had (the amplifier chip fried), I'm completely satisfied."
1,Latch problem,"I purchased one of these units and they sound really great! I really enjoyed the XP-SR320 until the cds played intermittently. I believe the problem is with the locking latch. When closing the cover and locking it sometimes the cd would not mount but when push down on the cover with my hand the display would show that a cd was ready to play, when I let go the display would go blank. The cd would play fine as long as I pushed down on the lock but it finally went bad altogether but the radio still works. The unit worked fine about 6 months. My friend also had this same unit and his unit stop playing cds as well. It's kind of disapointing because this is one of the best sounding portable cd players I have ever heard."
1,Stopped playing after 6 months!!,After having this for 6 months the Cd's just stopped playing. First thought it was the batteries. But then it just STOPPED. I was totally [...]!! I paid [...] bucks. Plus headphones were too bulky when working out at the gym. Buttons weren't easy to push so I had to keep pulling out of my case. Disappointed.
4,Nice price,"But the price got even better AFTER I received mine. I paid 99 bucks and now you can get it for 89 bucks. Oh well, you can't win them all. The unit seems like it will do everything I need. It would be nice to have a belt clip with it. I wasn't that concerned about a belt clip initially because it's advertised as including a sports pouch. Just like another reviewer though I found that it does NOT include one. Overall I think the player will do what I want and that is to take the boredom out of jogging/"
2,Defective??,"I like the advertised features- 48 sec. anti-shock memory, DSL bass, CD-R/RW playback, radio tuner. This would be a great CD player if it wasn't defective!!The radio tuner often ""freezes"" for no apparent reason. I then have to remove the batteries to un-freeze it and I lose all of my preset stations. This is a real inconvenience if you're out walking or jogging! Also, the single track repeat mode does not work. In the beginning I also had problems with the headphone output, but that seems to have cleared up. Perhaps my unit is defective or perhaps they are all like mine- I wouldn't know- AIWA didn't include any contact information so I don't even know how to get service on the darn thing and it's been to long to return it to the store!"
1,defective,"Unfortunately I think I received a defective player. The radio work fine, however the cd player is very temperamental, but when work it worked well during my treadmill workout, also the display never worked. My last complaint is it did not come with a clip, hand-strap, or waist belt so you have hold on to it as you run. I plan to return this item sometime this week."
1,Book not quite up to the description...,"Okay, so I've ordered quite a few books via this method and I try to only get like new, or slightly under. This book was old, dirty, had crusty food (or other items) suck on it and even had a bug squished in the middle. It didn't quite live up to the description of its quality."
4,A Truely Sad Story,"This historically accurate story of the end of the Aztec Empire in Mexico is well written and engrossing. The history it contains is better suited for oder children, but the format is engaging for younger readers. It's the kind of book that made this adult reader want to learn more about the Aztec and Hernan Cortes!"
1,The bare bones of buddhism,"My gripe with this book is that there is no introduction, nor any commentary. Whilst claiming to be the Max Muller translation it avoids including any of that fine oriental scholar's discussions or commentaries."
4,A Book of Wisdom,This book is an excellent collection of thoughts for those with a strong mind to ponder. It is a deep experience for all.
2,hmmmmmmmm,"These translations do not give me presence but the essentials are there .Kinda like bacon and eggs with out the bacon.I chanced on this printing that introduced me to Buddhism when doing religious studies at University.This text was my first reading of Buddist scripture: after I picked myself off the floor ,I was compelled to dig into all the translations I could get my grubby little paws on( the sutras are all numbered so its easy to do) Lots of translations out there.You will know when you have one,it will just taste right.Or do your own. Bon appetito"
4,A quick translation of the Dhammapada...,"This book is not a quick read if you wish to take something from it. Like most Buddhist writings, it is divided in to smaller parts for discussion (like ""Old Age,"" ""The World,"" and ""Happiness""). Within each of these parts, there is an explanation trying to illustrate this idea of the reader. It is not intended to be scanned. If you read one of these sections a day (they are usually one or two pages), just reflect on that. You will walk away with a much better understanding. It is designed to assist your personal meditations.I think it is a quick translation because I sometimes feel that ""Western"" words come into the translation rather than the intended word. For instance, I think ""temple"" would be a much better translation than ""church."" It would keep an Eastern feel to the writing."
2,Edition for those whose pocketbooks are on a diet,"I had to read this edition for my World Literature course and I was happy with the price (can't beat it!) and happy with the fact that it is free of scholarly interpretations, which can color the reader's opinions and/or perceptions. It also leaves the reader to come to their own conclusions.But one can entirely misinterpret the Buddha's teachings, especially if you've never read a single Buddhist text (like myself) and that's why I'm not too keen on this edition.The Dover Thrift Editions, to me, are meant to whet the appetite for more in-depth writings about a particular book. Sometimes it *does* help to have a scholar's insight - whether that person's take on the subject threatens to color your reading experience or not."
3,"Ok, if you've never heard of Buddhism before.","This is a quick little read (about 50 pages) that I found to get the general point across. It often reverts to juxtaposing paraphrases, repeating itself over and over, and often alludes to many Christian concepts such as sin, Heaven, Hell, and paying homage to the church. I have come to the conclusion that this book would come in handy to the as-of-now Christian who is looking into other religions and can't yet quite grasp the concept of a religion without a god, sins, or a heaven and hell. This book I believe was originally written in 1900, so it is fairly understanding as to why it is partially ignorant of some of the vital teachings of Buddha and why it curtails the full Buddhist perception."
5,Unbelievable wisdom,Whatever your faith may be there's a ton to be learned from Buddha. I'm a Christian myself but I reference this book as well as the Bible quite often. Simple principles but it's amazing how much truth there is behind it.
4,Nice looking and functional product,"This product looks nice, holds plenty of magazines, papers, etc. My only two complaints are that it only fastens to the wall at the top (it would be nice if it attached at the bottom too), and it does come a little bent up. The seller went to the trouble to double box it, but it is very fragile for shipping, so it still had a few issues. They were little, and I was able to push them back in to place. I didn't mind at all, but just understand you trade off the nice look of this rack for the strength you might get in a steel one for instance. I would buy it again."
4,Good Price,Item came with a pocket that was bent. We were able to bend it back but I think it was shipped this way. Shipping box didn't have any holes or crunched.
2,Boring,"There was not use of animations. I was unable to use for my original purpose, that is to teach a stree managment class. The material was accurate but the video could have been bettter produced to keep it intresting."
2,Confusing and wordy,"The book provides some good general information, but is very wordy and confusing at times. I was dissapointed"
2,The book was printed and cut with crooked pages,Even though it does not look like any text was cut off it is annoying to read a book that has some pages cut right and others are crooked and right down to the bottom edge of the book.
1,it's at most a baby step.,"This book is SO basic that I found it useless. I was hoping for a book with a little depth and some really practical information, but this has neither. I suppose if you want to learn the buzzwords but will never need to actually do anything with a wireless network it's okay, but if you need to actually set one up you should look elsewhere."
4,Very good quality!,"This ring looks great, my husband love it. The fact that it's only 2mm Half Round Band, gives it a very different look. We received in less than two, we were very pleased. A great quality for the unexpensive ring, you could save the rest of the money for the honeymood....as we did!!"
2,So little gold,"A mighty small amount of gold for the money. Actually, I returned this ring. It did not match my 14 kt white gold engagement ring. Looked like a different color metal. ALSO...I found this ring in 14 kt. white gold, same mm width at a big blue box retailer & it did match my ring...and for $27.00 and change !!! Weighed exactly the same so why spend more money?"
3,Very thin,"Everything was as promised, 14k white gold, sized correctly and very nice, but I had no idea how thin a 2mm width ring is. Imagine uncoiling a paperclip and shaping it around your finger - that's how thin it really is. Other than that, it's dainty, has clean lines and matches my thin engagement ring band."
3,"Not a deluxe cover, but good enough","I ordered the sunburst design. It came as pictured, but it is not a ""deluxe"" cover as indicated in the item name. This didn't bother me so much because it still fits the deluxe pillow. I've been using it for about 8 weeks now and the cover has held up well in the wash. The only thing I don't like about the My Brest Friend covers in general is that the clasp makes a clicking sound when you open it. This can sometimes wake up a sleeping baby which is no fun for anyone."
5,Love the Brest Friend,"Had to buy a new cover because in my new mom haze I dried the original cover and it shrunk. And the zipper broke. Been using this new cover for the past six months, no shrinking, no breaking, no issues. Love this nursing pillow!"
3,Editorial Review,"""The four-disc box set Healing Music (subtitled 'Four Pioneers Explore the Healing Power of Music') re-packages four separate albums, all originally released by the Relaxation Company in 1995: Jim Oliver's 'Harmonic Resonance,' Dr. Jeffrey Thompson's 'Inner Dance,' Deuter's 'Wind & Mountain,' and Boris Mourashkin's 'Points of Light.' There are no differences in the recordings themselves; it's simply a handy way to acquire all four albums at once. ~ Steve Huey, All Music Guide"""
3,Missing parts,When I recieved my order there were 3 planets missing and they all pretty much look the same. Sending it back!
4,Not so glow-in-the dark..but really nice,We bought these to use as Christmas ornaments for our grandson to put on the tree...non-breakable! He loved the detail on them.
3,"its small and not to scale,glow in complete dark.",It is smaller then you think. As pointed out not to scale. Ours do glow for a bit but has to be totally dark. Our kids are 4 and 6 they like naming them and it gets more conversations started about planets and day and night so we're happy with it for now.
2,Justo k,"the quality of this product is just fine, not great. The size and color of planets are not upto scale. Also, the Sun could have been better constructed as a glowing object."
4,Pleased with no complaints,"We ordered this product for the school science fair.It served every purpose and is a neat little toy.If I had to find a negative, it would be a coupleof the 'planets' were not in proportion. But forgrade school, kids arent that detailed so it wasunimportant."
1,Not Educational,"Sun and planets are not to scale. Two large gas giants, all other planets are nearly the same size, and our Sun is far too small.Use this toy, and your children will develop mistaken assumptions regarding the relative sizes of the Sun and planets compared to Earth.On the plus side, Pluto is included in the display with the other eight planets. Pluto aways was, and always will be a planet. Neil deGrasse Tyson can go kiss a big fat planet."
1,Does not glow.,"My son received this set for his birthday. While he liked looking at and touching each planet, none of them glow. Even after leaving them in a bright room with the lights on for several hours. Would not purchase if you are looking for a glow in the dark set."
1,What you get is what you paid for!!,"Design looks real nice but you can see the cheap look in every components that it comes with including the dials, glass, leather strap and box! If you realize that you are paying only $20 and don't expect to have a $80 worth watch then this would be ok. Advt says original price as $80 but I would say it is worth only $20. Would not recommend for someone that is going to have 1 and only 1 watch. If you are adding one for your casual use, then this would be a good fit."
1,Worth every $$$ I paid for it...and I paid very little for it,"Ok, will keep it short:- pros - great design, delivery in time, accurate quartz design- cons - poor craftsmanship, cheap glass top that's superbly fingerprint friendly.I paid 20$ for this watch (original price was 80$). Design is really really nice - haven't really seen anything else that looks like it. Yet, once I opened up the box and saw the actual watch I was very disappointed. Top glass plate attracts finger prints. Glass itself was not cut well, so you can see the rather rough edges...I would not recommended it."
3,"Looks nice, but doesn't work so well","I bought this kettle for it's modern and sleek appearance. It looks just as nice as it does in the photos, and the click to open/click to close button on the kettle works well. However, there's a few things I'd improve about this kettle. First, filling it is a bit difficult, as the handle doesn't move, so you have to angle it just right to fill it with water from your sink's faucet. Secondly, it pours a little strangely. Rather than a nice stream, water comes out in a splashy manner, making it rather easy to get a few drops of boiling water on your hands if you're holding the cup you're pouring the water into. Lastly, it doesn't heat as fast as some other kettles. I would recommend this kettle if looks are more important or if you don't need to use a kettle except once in a while."
4,Good & Stylish,"This kettle is maybe even better-looking than in the photos, and works well to boot. I drink several cups of tea a day, and this kettle works great for me. The opening on the top is large enough that you can wash inside and wide enough that it's as easy-to-fill as any other kettle with a fixed handle. The handle stays cool unless you fill the kettle to the very brim. You need to tilt the kettle to a very sharp angle to pour the water, and at first I didn't believe I needed to tilt it so far -- probably why the other reviewer didn't get a steady stream out of it. Once tilted far enough it pours with a nice steady stream.I can't decide if I like the way the spout opens and closes -- there's a trigger to open and a button to close. It's comfortable to use but I have a mild tendency to leave the spout open after pouring.Overall, the kettle feels heavy and well-made. I think this will stick around for a while."
2,"Handle too hot, hard to fill","The handle gets too hot to hold, and the handle is too low to the pot to slip under the faucet to fill easily, so I need to fill via the spout."
5,"So good, I needed another one","I had this tea kettle in the white enamel, and because of my bad habit of leaving water in the kettle overnight, it rusted around the rim where the water goes in. The new kettle, all shiny stainless steel, doesn't have that rim. But I still might buy another just to have should I need it in the future. Having a kettle that opens so smoothly when you lift it is a real joy. It's comodious and easy to clean. The handle never gets hot. It's a real treasure."
2,Adorable but,"I recently changed my kitchen accents from blue to red. This tea kettle was perfect.Great color, cute shape, right size, easy to handle. However, three months later and four uses later, the whistle cap fell off with the spring as I was pouring. I pushed it back on, but it is loose and I assume it will fall off again next time I try to use it. Cute kettle but poorly made."
2,form great - function not so much,"This kettle is beautiful and looks great on my stove. One of the reasons I chose it was that I had read the handle stays cool. It is a pet peeve of mine that in 2012 one would sell a kettle where the handle gets too hot to use without an oven mitt. This kettle unfortunately falls in that category. It becomes too hot to even click the spout opening; much less pick up the kettle. This is a design flaw I would not expect from OXO, and it is the reason I cannot recommend this product."
3,Well made - but the color is not really red!,"The color is not a true red. It is much more orange than red - which is a bit of a disappointment. Also, the handle gets hot when used. It is def well made and I'm quite sure it will last however, a bit disappointment."
4,love the color of this teakettle/,"A very well made teakettle, love the color , adds a nice touch to my country kitchen. Took a bit of getting used to the ""click"" on the handle, but now , can't imagine not using this for my evening cup of tea.!!I like the size of the teakettle as well, the whistle is loud enough,overall a great purchase."
3,Kettle,Kettle is fine but the whistle doesn't really make a loud enough noise to hear it. Probably wouldn't buy the same kettle again.
3,"In case of stinky service, please break glass.","When I first finished reading ""Why Service Stinks"", I immediatly started re-reading it. The stories are humorous, and insightful. The message is important. This is a perfect companion to ""Good to Great"". Mr. Gross is full of great ideas from hiring to keeping the best. I also like the idea that it is not just the employee who is responsible for great service.I enthusiasticly recommend this book to anyone in a business that meets the public."
5,Works great with Vista,"I bought this cable after upgrading my computer to a machine running Vista. Eventhough the description does not state it'll work with Vista, I gave it a shot anyway. The drivers are already part of Vista and installation was a snap."
1,HAVE XP? FORGET TRYING THIS!!!,"I don't recommend this cable at all for folks with XP as there is some problem (very complicated, to judge by the volume of questions on the XP forums) between parallel-to-USB cables when using XP. Also I found this same item cheaper at Radio Shack but, fat lot of good that did me, because it doesn't work with XP anyway.Caveat emptor!"
3,"works well, not as roomy as expected","made a big difference in our house, but I wish the levels were roomiertakes an hour to assemblecount the screws before starting. Had enough, but some were assigned to the wrong area"
1,Horrible product!,"Upon opening the package and laying all the pieces out to assemble, I noticed that a few of the main pieces were badly damaged (wood chipping off). The quality of the wood is just horrible. On top of that, the instructions were bad and there were a million screws! Should have just went to Ikea...highly do not recommend purchasing this item."
3,It is okay,very difficult to assemble. I nearly returned it for this reason. some of the pieces were ragged at the ends.
3,Not very durable,"Thinner than I expected. The decal looks like it was ironed on so it has a plastic feel, like on a t-shirt. Not good for actually drying dishes, I doubt it will hold up after many washings. It is fine for hanging on the oven for game days, though."
2,This product did not work for me,"This product did not work for me. It was not high enough (or thick enough), the width was not wide enough, and the back of the pillow hurts my back (rather than supporting it) when I sit on sofa, bed, or rocking chair. I bought a Boppy pillow and kept that instead for breast-feeding. I hope you'll find your preference."
4,My favorite nursing pillow!,"I purchased this after I bought the Boppy because I'd heard it provided good support while nursing. I much prefer to use this pillow to the Boppy when I nurse. It provides good back support (I usually put a throw pillow above the back part to support my upper back) and it's nice that it's flat so the baby doesn't roll one way or the other. The little bumps help keep the baby's head in place at the breast if you are doing other things while nursing (eating, emailing, texting, etc). The little pocket is handy to keep things in that you may need. I have had to get up while nursing and have been able to walk around while my baby continued to eat because this straps securely around you (obviously you need to support the baby's weight under the pillow and hold onto the baby so she doesn't roll off!). This pillow certainly helped make the difficult task of figuring out how to breastfeed a whole lot easier."
5,"mother of three says get this, forget the boppy!","I bought mine through craigslist and it was very clean/good conition at a fraction of the price. That being said, I would have happily paid full retail for this nursing pillow, which has indeed become my breast friend. The strap feels secure and offers my aching postpartum back much needeed support. The pocket is priceless. I keep lanisoh, face wipes,Nosefrida The Snotsucker Nasal Aspirator,Itzbeen Baby Care Timer, Blue,nail clippers,WubbaNub Lamb, and a receiving blanket tucked in with still more room to spare.Although the boppy can be used as a pillow for your bum postpartum, thats about the only thing I wold use it for. I never cared for the design of the boppy and am so glad I found this. A must-have for me!"
5,Can't be more pleased,"Every new mom should have one. Some moms seem to adapt very quickly to breastfeeding and can hold the baby a variety of ways - this is not me at all! This pillow is awesome and really places the baby at exactly the right position. Plus it has 2 little ""bumps"" on the front to lift the baby's head also. I sometimes had a hard time getting out of it (taking it off) when I didn't want to wake up the baby but this is really minor compared to the advantages that it offers."
5,AMAZING!,"I didn't discover the Brest-Friend until my 3rd baby, but WOW! The lumbar support was exactly what I needed and the firm, flat surface supported my baby just right. Aside from swaddle-blankets, this is the best baby purchase possible! GET ONE! Plus if my toddler misbehaves while I am nursing, I can stand up to redirect the child ...then return to nursing in a snap because the pillow is ready."
3,"Good for in bed, not really anywhere else","This thing is great for sitting in the bed and using it, but if you want to use it in a chair forget it, it's hard to get everything situated right. It also gets a bit hot, and it's sometimes hard to position the baby's head right. But other than that it works well."
2,Design probably good-Fabrication NOT,"This item and an extra cover were purchased as a baby shower gift on the recommendation of my daughter who breast fed both her children. She had used a similar product but had read some good things about the ""Brest Friend"" and and thought it appeared to be well designed for its purpose. When it was delivered, and before it was even taken out of the clear plastic packaging, my wife looked at it and said ""No Way"". The fabric exterior looked, felt, and truly was way to abrasive for a newborn's or infant's tender skin. The additional cover was made of the same fabric. Because of the actual makeup of the fabric, its was not likely that even repeated washings would soften the fabric to any noticeable degree. My talented wife has been sewing, knitting and otherwise working with fabrics for decades and has years of experience with infants and their skin so her reaction comes from two areas of substantial experience/expertise."
5,awesome pillow,"absolutely amazing, completely worth the money! it is sooooo much more comfortable and very easy to use, i definitely recommend this product!"
4,Best Nursing Pillow,"I love my ""My Brest Friend"" nursing pillow. It is so comfortable for me and baby. The hard pillow supports baby and helps keep her in position while feeding. I love this pillow so much I purchased this one as a backup for when the first one gets dirty, and I am washing the cover. There are a couple of cons. First, the cover is hard to get back on after washing. Second, there is a buckle on the side to strap mom in, and it is hard to buckle when holding baby. It is best to get the pillow on and then pick up baby. Overall, I love this pillow. It is much more comfortable than my ""Boppy"" pillow and supports baby much better! This would make a great gift for a new mom who plans to nurse."
3,my brest friend is pretty good,"I like this breast feeding pillow because it is nice and firm. However, I find the part that wraps around your back gets in the way if you want to lean against a chair back or wall.I think I may open up the cover and cut off that part of the foam pillow insert. Also, I bought a second one so I can somehow stack them together because I have a long torso. This means I am often putting another pillow underneath to boost baby up so I am not hunching over to feed her."
2,"Thought I'd love it, but I could do without it","I got the Brest Friend pillow this time around, having used the Boppy for my son when he was a baby. I actually don't really like this pillow. It's big and bulky, hard to position correctly, and the velcro strap on the deluxe cover (which I purchased separately) itches like crazy against my bare skin! I'm not sure if the regular cover has the itchy velcro strap, as I removed the leaf cover immediately and haven't looked at it since.Most of the time, I just nurse using a regular pillow and would get by just fine without a special nursing pillow."
2,Boppy Would Be Better,"I purchased the Breast Friend over the standard Boppy thinking it was better designed to support the newborn during breastfeeding. I do think this is true but it has some major issues that make me wish I had just stuck to the standard Boppy. It is made of hard Styrofoam with makes it difficult to sit in chairs with arms while you nurse. You have to wrap it around you (there is no place to put that back support if you do not) which just digs into your back if you are sitting in a chair and leaning back at all. When you stand up, you have this thing clinging to you and no hands free to remove it (forget trying to get it off without waking the baby) which is a hassle too. Finally, it is not as versatile as a Boppy. It might work for some, but I just ended up using pillow(s) instead."
3,Wasn't for me,I prefer the Boppy. I found this to be too rigid and the material was scratchy! The arm rest bump hurt my arm. The pocket was cool though.
3,Wish I'd Had the Boppy,"I guess this just wasn't for me. After reading all the fab reviews, I decided to get this instead of a Boppy. It was good for a little while and I appreciated the support for the baby and my back but since you have to get it wrapped around you and then settled (while your baby screams), it isn't as easy to use as a Boppy. Plus after about 2 months, it was just easier to skip it and it has been in the closet ever since. At least with a Boppy, you can use it for other things as your child grows and sits up, etc. This had such a short useful life and is such a big thing to store, it just wasn't worth it."
3,"Great for the early months, cover zipper broke after 1 wash","I used this constantly when our baby was a tiny thing (probably up until about 4 months). I loved that I could nurse him while working at my desk if I had to, thanks to this pillow. BUT, the cover zipper broke the first time I washed it. Very low quality. I stopped using it at about month five and now never use it. I'm glad I bought it but I'm still super annoyed about the faulty zipper."
1,Smells like Glue!,"I loved the concept of the pillow and how it made a level surface for nursing. However, the pillow smelled like industrial glue. Even after airing it out for a day it still smelled like glue. I have to return the pillow. When I took the cover off to air it out, I noticed that each of the pieces had been glued together. I am trying to find a similar option without the glue smell because I liked it better than the boppy."
4,Liked it for the most part.,"Pros: stays on when moving around, nice positioning for baby, adjustable strapCons: the back rest hurt my back a little bit, takes a little longer to get on than a simple Boppy"
5,Best purchase,"I didn't think I would need a special nursing pillow. Initially I started nursing using a regular pillow. When I got this, I noticed how perfect it is. It makes it easy to keep my baby positioned and sturdy while saving my back. It's easy to relax instead of thinking a pillow is going to slide and my baby will be moved while nursing. I highly recommend this for newly nursing moms."
5,Great Product,"A friend recommended this to me over the boppy, and I didn't want to spend the money initially. But I'm so glad I did - the pillow doesn't slide or fall off, and the little pocket is perfect for holding a pacifer or a watch for timing feedings. I also love that it's adjustable as I shed the baby pounds. I highly recommend this product."
3,Wait until after the baby is born,"This product seems great, but I recommend you buy it after your baby is born. My wife asked me to order this from Amazon during our third trimester in preparation for the delivery. However, if you end up with a c-section or other surgical intervention during your delivery, she has found this product is not easy to use because of the pressure it puts on your abdomen. The pain is there for about a month or sometimes slightly longer. By time she was able to use the product, our baby was much bigger and she found it uncomfotable to hold him on the pillow. However, many of our friends have used it with their babies for much longer, which is why I recommend you wait until after the baby comes to buy this product. Your hospital should have one you can borrow while you are there - that way you can figure out if this works well for you and order it accordintgly."
1,Don't put this near your child!,"My package just got here.. I unzipped the plastic and I couldn't believe the STRONG ODOR that was off-gassing. I got a headache immediately. I looked up ""Polyurethane foam"" and couldn't believe what I was reading! I wont have this near my baby! I had to put it in the garage.. I'd rather have a sore back than a SICK CHILD!""Polyurethane foam (essentially solid petroleum) is extremely flammable. To combat this hazard, industrial toxic fire retardants are added. The most common chemical fire retardant used to treat polyurethane foam has been pentaBDE, a toxin associated with hyperactivity and neuro-behavioral alterations. PentaBDE is not bound to the foam, and leaches out into the surrounding air.PentaBDE has recently been banned in Europe. It has also been banned by the State of California as of 2006. However, there is currently no planned government action to recall the millions of baby mattresses presently in use that contain pentaBDE."""
5,This is great!,"Love it, my week old daughter much prefers this to being held up with arms or propped with pillows. It works in several feeding positions, my baby likes the football hold, and it's great that it clips around the waist so you can walk around with it. I also like the pattern better than any of the other options I saw."
3,"Cumbersome, but works.","I really wanted to love this product, and was hoping for a "" magic bullet"". I had a Boppy first, and used it in the hospital. I didn't like that Boppy came away from the body. My breast friend has some definite pros: it clasps around your body, and offers back support. It is fairly foolproof in the way the baby has to be positioned, so it might help moms who are new to breastfeeding. Cons: the pillow is rigid and is cumbersome and difficult to put on, especially if you are in bed, or after a c-section. It offers only one position breastfeeding. I like to alternate the positions, like football and cross body hold, and am back to using Boppy."
3,"Ok, but not for me.","This pillow is ok for someone who is just starting with breastfeeding. I however had an almost 10 lb baby who was quite active, even when little. It worked well on occasion, but in the end we mostly just found other more comfortable positions that worked for us. We plan on having a second baby in the future, but I am giving this to someone else because I just didn't like it as much as I had hoped."
2,Boppy was much better for me,"I've been breastfeeding for 6 months now and had both the My Brest Friend(MBF) and the Boppy. I preferred the Boppy much more and here's why:-Boppy is easier to use. I just grab the Boppy and and throw it around my waist instead of fumbling with a strap on the MBF and getting it clicked in.-Boppy is more comfortable. That piece that goes around your back on the MBF is just uncomfortable to me. The Boppy just seemed much more soft and comfy for baby too.-Boppy is multi purpose. I sat on it when my bottom hurt after childbirth, used it as a place to set the baby, and used it for every nursing session.-Boppy feels better made. The My Best Friend just felt cheap to me."
4,It really is my brest friend,"Baby and 1st time mom were having latching problems. I just couldn't manage to keep her in the right position. Bed pillows and other nursing pillows were all too soft, baby would sink too low, or they would push away from my body. My Brestfriend stays in place because you lean against the part that wraps around your back. I put a long throw pillow under it so it won't lose shape over time. It is firm enough that baby doesn't sink too low. Myonly reason for rating 4/5 is I have no idea why it has 2 lumps on the top of the pillow."
3,Good for support; Not the best qaulity; Overpriced,"This is a nice design with support for the baby's head and the strap to hold the pillow in place. It's not the best quality though with a piece of foam and a rather thin quality cover. Took many washes to get the smell off the pillow. The price is a scam though, which has a wide range ($20 - $40) depending on the cover! Watch out for it. I don't think it's worth 20 either, but oh well."
3,No friend of mine: not easy to use,"I bought this after all the recommendations but 3 1/2 months after baby was born I broke down and bought the boppy. Disadvantages:1. too short, needed another pillow in addition2. the back bar always hurt my back and you can't bf without it being buckled or it slips away.3. need two hands and I never had two hands when it was time to feed the baby!#1 and #2 meant that I rarely used it. Now I just got the boppy and it worked great! it's high enough, easy to put on and take off and I can do it with one hand! Wish I'd have gotten the boppy in the first place."
5,Better Than I Expected,"I have enjoyed several of Stephen Arteburn's other books, so I had pretty high expectations for this one. And I was VERY surprised that this book actually EXCEEDS my expectations. Like some other ""God-based"" weight-loss books, Stephen talks about how God can meet emotional needs that we currently meet with food. But this book takes it so much further by making the entire topic relatable to guys like me...guys struggling with weight issues as well as spiritual issues.BUT, Stephen talks about the subject in a way that makes it MUCH easier to integrate these ideas into day-to-day life. With the clear-cut science presented by Dr. Linda backing up everything Stephen talks about, this book is a WINNER, for sure."
4,Motivation,"I am just into this program, starting chapter 4. Very good motivator and gives great inspiration. Does ask tough questions to look at yourself but in a positive way."
4,Gift for my daughter,My daughter loves this as does her children. They use it for school projects and also for making cards. The down side is that it is hard to find the paper that goes through the machine. I did find it on line but we can't find it at our craft stores.
4,love it !,I decided to buy this one after I watched the how to video of this product and I'm glad I bought it ! It is so easy and you can make pretty good stickers at home ! I know I will use this a lot !
5,xyron sticker maker,I gave this to someone for Christmas and they loved it. I also have one of these and it's the best investment I ever got ! Love it's compact size. Great for scrapbooking trips
4,Easy to use,"My daughter loves this machine! It's easy to use and very versatile. Prepare to go through the cartridges quickly, however. They don't last long."
5,The Weather Station,Works exactly as claimed. I have three sensors. Two work perfectly at more than 80 feet from the receiver. One has to be a bit closer. The min/max functions are seldomnly used and somewhat confusing. Only suggestion would be to backlight the data. LED readouts are difficult to read if not parrallel to face.
3,hard to read,we have owned other weather stations and this one is hard to read if you don't look at it just so. the numbers change depending on the angle. works well though.
1,Not working,"Have had this unit 8 months, and it no longer works. This is the second La Crosse unit I've had that totally quit working. At least the first made it through the warranty. It's not a good sign when you call about a warranty and never come off of hold. After waiting 15 minutes, I was automatically forced to leave a message -- with no option to hold longer. I'll see if I get a return call."
5,Lots of information,"I've been using the weather station for a couple of weeks now with no complaints. The wireless sensor linked up without a hitch and the temperature output matched the main unit in a little ""same room"" test I did before moving the sensor."
4,Does the job,"I purchased this set in store at my local Target when it was on sale. I've always liked Corelle but this is the first set I've ever owned. The floral print is cheerful but, sometimes I wish I had bought a more subdued print. My family and I get alot of use out of the whole set and so far have only had one small chip in one of the 10 oz. bowl (we mostly hand wash dishes). I do wish Corelle would include the luncheon plate instead of the bread plate in more of their sets. Because to purchase the indevidual pieces can be a bit expensive."
4,Low-budget brilliance,"This one basically does for 1970's Italian horror what Lost Skeleton of Cadavra did for 1950's b-movies. Lots to like here - creative effects, hilariously authentic plot and dialogue, and music which is also spot-on to the source genre. Part 1 is slightly more of an homage than a spoof, although there's plenty of that too, while Part 2 is where things really get crazy.The cast of characters is surprisingly extensive, but none are really neglected and all mesh together fairly well. You'll find yourself laughing at and wishing harm upon them at the same time. Definitely worth checking out!"
5,Great CD!!!!,This is a new way to hear Finnish Tangos as Jazz & Blues style!!! This is one of the most interesting CDs I've ever listened!!! Really welldone and played by professional musicians. More something like this!!!
3,Regular,"Excelente calzado, muy rapido envio, a pesar que la caja decia 8 de talla, el calzado internamente era 7, por lo tanto no estoy muy a gusto."
5,Addicted to Ephron,"Peter Zak, the hero of Addicted, the second in a series of mysteries set in Boston, is my kind of guy -- compassionate yet slightly cynical, willing to rush headlong into an obviously dangerous situation to protect those whom he loves, and smart!I couldn't figure out who done it, kept turning the pages as fast as I could read because I wanted to know ""what happens next,"" and rushed to a very satisfying end.But come on, Pete, stop neglecting Annie's obvious interest in you and get on with life!A great and satisfying mystery read. Five stars, easily."
2,never grabbed me,"Yes, this book is well written. Yes, the plot and subject matter should have interested me. Yet, for a reason that I cannot put my finger on, this story never drew me in. I think that the characters didn't quite come alive to me, which made the story not so believable. Overall, I was disappointed in this medical mystery."
2,just OK,"After half a season, the plastic handle, plastic preparation surface, electronic ignition and cooking grates either weathered to the point of not being able to be used, or broke outright. Replacement parts are very hard to find.Will not buy another Char-Broil item again."
4,great steam vac,"The McCulloch MC1860 does a great job, it cleaned our 1964 bathroom tiles so that they look new!The steam creates alot of water and the vacuum feature sucks up the water with no problem. It also cleaned some real dirty grout to look like new. It does take more time to use ( not just a quick mop) but the result is a clean, clean floor and it is worth the time and effort!"
3,"PC Version is ok, still has problems.","Overall the game, graphics and sound are all really good in my opinion. Couple of drawbacks though, if you have a NAT internet connection (no idea what it is but the game detects it to see if you have one), you will not be able to join Online Multi Tournament Tables, but you can still play online in Single Table Tournies. Also, after about 15 minutes of playing, the game just closed, disappeared, all progress lost. Now this has only happened once in about 3 hours of gameplay, so it may be nothing. But it was something to be concerned about.I have contacted tech support and as of yet, 24 hours later, there is no reply, but they do say it takes them 48 hours to respond to requests.Overall I am not sure on this game, great idea, seems to have some problems though, perhaps a patch would fix things up."
3,it could've been better !!!,"i was very disappointed with Stacked (PC), especially with all the hooplaabout the supposedly higher A.I. capability, it was very so-so. the graphics is almost designed for mid-90's pcs, and the character creationwas a joke."
1,Amazon you suck,"Amazon snuck a CLEAN version of this CD on me. I notice the title now says ""CLEAN"" well, too late for me. I lose my mind when I hear censorship beeps. Just the man tryin to keep us down."
4,A great cat and mouse book with eloquent writing,"I had never read any Walter Dean Myers, but this book was a quick, truly entertaining read. I read it in about three hours and thought that the characters were not only truly believeable, but I found a bit of myself in Artemis. His name is justly given. I truly enjoyed it."
2,The Righteous Revenge Of Artemis Bonner,"Personally, I think that this book is a bit scary for people who get scared very easily and are under 12. Anyway, I found this book quite interesting, the way it is written. This book takes place in 1880 in a old town around the Alaskan Territory. The things they mention may be frightning - like the was Lucy Feather dip ripping off Artemis's ear with her mouth, while she is hanging upside down.The story they includes some eveidence if how it was baak then in the 1800's, like having very cheap things like accomodation. The way they spoke is also different like: ""Where are you headed?"" Instead of "" Where are you heading?"".You should read this book if you are interested in all the things I have mentioned.Thank you!Celia:)"
4,The Righteousm Revenge of Artemis Bonner,this book was very fun to read. it had a lot of action. I liked this book beocuase the main charter really fought for what he belived in. Also this book was filled with suspence. we never expected how the book would end! the only thing that I did not like about this book is that there is not a sequel. for that I am up set. iI hope that in the future another book comes out!
3,Well made. Good cord. The stereo sound is way too dark and muddy,"I like that you can control the volume on each ear of the headphones. I like the leather earcups. I like that they are made of thick, solid material, and that you can adjust the tightness of the fit. They are built better than the high end Grado headphones which cost hundreds of dollars. They also have a powerful stereo sound.But they also sound muddy and dark and fuzzy. Even on the flat ipod eq setting, they sound too harsh. I can't quite put a finger on it, but I keep wanting to adjust something that can't be adjusted. If this one problem could be taken care of, these would be a steal at $20, but this one glaring sound issue keeps me from recommending these otherwise well made phones. But they are definitely a step up from the ipod earbuds."
5,Don't miss out! Hot Body always delivers!!,Those of you who have grown up with Hot Body videos know exactly what to expect. Beautiful women in a softcore adult dvd. Full frontal and even closeups. The sad thing is that Hot Body is no longer producing new dvd's or VHS tapes and the prices are actually starting to rise. Check out ebay for some ridiculous bidding on Hot Body VHS tapes. When you find dvd's for less than $17 snatch them up. There aren't many out there and Sneaky Preview 68 is definitely one to grab.
5,Just in time.,I have been really happy with this product and I must say that I am happy I was able to find it on Amazon for $20 cheaper than anywhere else. I would suggest though not buying a shoe online until you have had the opportunity to try it on in person.
2,bad cushion inserts,"These shoes were my first pair of addias running shoes. I am happy with everything, but the cushion inserts, which didn't stay put and bunched toward the back of the hill. Seems they should be secured better."
4,Perfect for two rooms,"My bedroom and the guest room were arranged nicely, but electrical outlets in both rooms were visible and unattractive to my eye. I had looked and looked for something to make it better. When I saw the picture here of the Winsome Wood 3-Tier A-Frame Shelf, I felt it might work in both places. I ordered one, put it in the guest room and immediately ordered the second one for my room. It's slightly unusual, very attractive, and useful. It's also so easy to assemble. I also felt it was reasonably priced. I'm extremely happy with them.Winsome Wood 3-Tier A-Frame Shelf, Black"
4,Classic Science Fiction,"This copy has the full dinner scene which is a bit lengthy for a modern audience. However it does make the film complete.It is classic, so little else to say. If you are a fan of silents, Fritz Lang, or Science Fiction, this is a worthy addition to have if not to watch."
3,Not enough recipes,"The recipes and photos are good, however as far as the book is concerned it's too many pages and not enough recipes. The way the book is put together, the recipes are spread out over the page, so something that could nicely and easily fit in half a page is spread over 1 or more pages leaving most of the pages blank. One may think is getting a great book but ends up with what is truly a very small recipe book."
1,CHEAP!!!!!,$150.00 for COMPLETE PLASTIC!!! Thats right...no metal...No glass!!! Very Poor description. An appropriate price for this garbage would be about 15 dollars per unit. Please dont waste your hard earned money on these.
2,Syntax Carribran Cooker,I did not like the taste at all. It is awful tasting and not at all what I was expecting . I will not buy this flavor again. Now I am afraid to try any if the other flavored NectarsI like the Fuzzey Navel 100% better .
5,Nectar is the BEST whey protein Ive used,"Ive used a couple different protein powder products and after using Nectar Whey Protein Isolate Ive decided it is the best Ive used. It tastes great, mixes very well and contains very little or no fat or cholesterol and abundant high quality protein. I have not noted any undesirable aftertaste at all."
4,"Good product, not all flavors are fantastic","I like the Syntrax whey isolates, they are low in calories and fat, and taste better than the chalky brown stuff everybody else makes. They are not all the same, though. I've tried 6 different flavors, here's how that went:Green apple - tastes like funky fake apples......and barf. I forced it down for 3 days, then put the rest in the garbage. Stay away.Carribean cooler - tastes like watery coconuts. I choked it down, but it wasn't great. The wife liked it, though. Others on Amazon seem to like it, too.Fuzzy naval and natural peach - tastes like fake peaches, pretty good choiceKiwi strawberry - tastes mostly like weak strawberry snapple, pretty good choiceRoadside lemonade - not quite lemonade, but pretty good for a protein mix"
1,nasty,"I was expecting to really like this, as I can not live without some of the other Nectar flavors. But it was like taking bad medicine. I could not get it down. I would definately try to get a sample packet before buying in bulk."
3,Not a fan of this flavor,"I tried this Caribbean flavor and do not like it. However, mixing in a banana made it taste a little better as it is too expensive to throw away. I will stick with the other flavors offered."
5,"Great change of pace, yes it is still whey","This is my favorite whey protein and I've tried most of em. I'm a big fan of the Nectar line in general but this is hands-down the best. It is still whey so, as I assume another reviewer can attest, it will not FEEL like lemonade but the taste is very much crystal lightish. It's not heavy like my go-to cheap chocolate or excessively sweet/rich like every vanilla whey out there, it's just good. If you mix it down with enough water I've found it to be the least ""heavy"" protein drink out there. This is your best bet if you're new to shakes or just tired of the same old whey."
1,gross...can't return it either!,"I bought this after reading the good reviews, but when I made it I almost gagged. Its very disappointing that Amazon won't let you return it, either. Buyer beware..."
2,Way too sweet for me..,"I know that after weight loss surgery our taste buds changed and mine sure did! I have a very heightened sense of sweet and this just makes me pucker. It's way too sweet even when I mixed it with some crystal light and extra water to dilute it. I know a lot of people love it, but it just is not for me -- or anyone else with a sweetness aversion after surgery."
1,VERY DISPLEASEDi,"I ordered twisted cherry, I never received it. They sent chocotate truffle instead. Later they said they would send me twisted cherry and still haven't received it. I won't by from this company again."
5,I have been using this for a while,I mix a spoon of this with 14 oz of Orange Juice. Tastes great.I mostly drink it right after a P90X workout.If I work out in the morning I mix it in a blender and put it in this:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018G4ZEW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prod_ttl_hst_6That product works well.
2,No....it doesn't taste good.,"I am not sure if the other reviewers have taste buds because this stuff tastes gross. It mixes fairly well with water. This, however, is a moot point as the taste is difficult to stomach; especially after a workout. The smell is rather off putting as well. I even added some sugar to no avail. It may be better blended with fruit. I'm sure there are better brands..."
3,Not what I expected.,I was a little dissapointed with the Fuzzy Navel. The flavor was not as good as the Chocolate Truffle. I couldn't really taste any peach flavor at all. It was ok just not as good as I was thinking it would be.
4,Surprisingly palatable flavor (fuzzy navel),"Does it really mix up lump free? Well, not without an immersion blender. The problem is the immersion blender creates a froth with an amazingly amoxicillin aftertaste. The scent is definitely reminiscent of amoxicillin as well. The warmer the water, the easier it dissolves, but the more pronounced the aftertaste becomes.My personal solution has been to mix with hot tap water and an immersion blender, followed by addition of some ice mixed to a slushy consistency; then gently stir in enough lukewarm water to bring it to a temperature you can comfortably just chug-down-and-get-it-over-with. The alternative, for an additional 150 calories or so is to dump in a container of Chobani greek yogurt with fruit and blend to the consistency of a ""smoothy""; the pomegranate and blueberry flavors mask the amoxicillin aftertaste best.Realistically, this is a flavor that can lived with day in, day out, without retching."
5,Actually tastes good!,I've been taking Nectar for about 2yrs now. I've always used Strawberry kiwi. Tried fuzzy navel and hated it. I finally ordered up the twisted cherry since it was on sale. So as you pop the top the cherry smell is there. Smells like a cherry airhead. Tastes really good too. I actually don't mind at all chugging down 3 a day.
4,Needed a girly protein shake!,"The Fuzzy Navel flavor is the first and only protein shake I've ever had. I can't have it in just water or blended ice...bleh! I have, however, discovered (after much practice) a way to make this so it tastes like a treat. I blend some ice, 3-4 tablespoons of yogurt, 1 scoop of Nectar powder, 1 tsp of psyllium husks and I have found that any fruit goes well in this although peaches and pineapple seem to do the best! The best part is with all of these ingredients it's only 230 calories all together (90 from the powder)! The whole purpose of me using a protein shake was to help repair my muscles after a work out not to bulk up and this is doing a fantastic job so far! With some finessing this is really a great product and exactly what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
1,Terrible,"I used to buy this product from other websites (allstarhealth, prosource etc.) but I bought it twice from amazon as it was offered at a better price... Unfortunately, I don't know why, the product is not of the same quality as the ones I used before, it doesn't dissolve well in water, no mater how long or hard I stirred... I bought it from one of the other sites again, and it dissolves a lot better...again I have no explanation for this, the product seemed the same...."
3,How much do I use?,"I have not tried this product because my container did not come with a scoop. I have been trying to find out how much Nectar Whey Protein would be in a scoop to put into the water. Can anyone tell me how big an amount is used? I ordered the Fuzzy Navel after reading all the comments, so I hope it is good. I cannot get past the milky flavor of other products.Thanks"
2,"I love Nectar, but....","This particular product only gets 2 stars from me. The taste is good, but unfortunately this flavor will not mix, even in a blender. It leaves gummy clumps of shake mix which are really gross. I love the flavor and I love all the other Nectar products I've tried, but this one has not lived up to my expectations. Usually Nectar mixes really well and really easily."
3,Syntrax Lemon Tea,"Once you get past the fact that the Lemon Tea is incredibly disgusting and does not taste like tea whatsoever, it's not too bad. With that said, Nectar is still my favorite protein. Strawberry Kiwi the best tasting flavor that I've had so far, and all kinds mix very well with water. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking to fill the protein void in their lives."
4,Protein Powder - Fuzzy Navel - best protein powder I've found so far,This protein powder is OK. I don't think any protein powder taste 'great'. I actually make a 28 oz shake using two heaping scoops of the powder and four Splenda (sucralose) packets. I mix the powder with a small amount of water then pour it into a blender bottle and add crushed ice. This powder is somewhat hard to mix. Unless you mix it thoroughly you will end up with small lumps in the finished product. I've tried shaking it in the shaker cups with the whisk ball but I found that really doesn't work. What you end up with is cup full of foam. The fuzzy navel is the best flavor of the Nectar powders.
5,Yummm!!,"This tastes just like a Pina Colada (minus the rum). I mix it with water and put it over crushed ice. Yum, yum yum!!!"
4,As good as protein drinks get,"I personally find all protein drinks somewhat unpalatable. That said, this one is acceptable for my two daily doses. I mix it with Crystal Light lemonade and that takes some of the cloying sweetness away. No empty calories from sugars, which is nice, and it mixes up almost as well as it claims to. I should give it a five, as it is superlative for its class of product, but protein drinks really just don't inspire that level of love from me."
2,Ugh ew,"The only okay type of Nectar is the chocolate and vanilla and they are WAY too sweet. I have tried all the flavors, and I even bought a tub of the crystal sky and the fuzzy navel... ugh after a couple days it's just disgusting. I'm not exaggerating when I say that thinking about either of those flavors makes me slightly nauseous. I use Isoflex now (I'm NOT getting paid to say this) and it's the best! I'll never use another whey protein besides Isoflex...heads up, their peanut butter chocolate tastes awesome and is not overly sweet. It's by far my favorite."
3,weird aftertaste,"This is not sweet so if you want something with a normal sweetness of protein shakes add some type of sugar free or the like flavoring. The powder mixes well, but I found it had a very strange aftertaste."
3,Does in a pinch,"I struggle with finding protein drinks that I like. As a WLS patient I need lots of protein, but it isn't easy to get it all in without protein drinks. I use this mixed with crystal light to up the lemonade flavor. It isn't like lemonade necessarily, but it works ok. Not my favorite, but a staple for me."
3,"Good, but not good enough","Calories to protein ration is excellent, the flavor just wasn't doing it for me. Just not natural tasting, more like tang, I'm back to peanut butter chocolate w/ berries..."
5,Plus one adds to the fun,I love the addition of Chopper. Tony is a great character for the crew to meet and yes he has a blue nose. He adds an extra dimension to the whole crew.
4,Great!,"Everything we expected. A great series for Japanese Anime fans! My 14 year old enjoys the series and although not intended for young viewers, it is a hit for teens!"
5,one piece,it is my farvorit series i just love the series what more can i say its great and i might buy the holle show another time
4,One Piece: Collection Four,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view.
2,Not much more than the manual...,"In all the pages here in this book, there is really little that they go into beyond the manual. In fact, the step-by-steps in the manual have tell me more about what to do with the program. The restoration example is just aweful. Though I am sure the authors know the program, I don't know that it came across in this book. that it is rated to expert doesn't seem fitting. There are books that don't claim to be for experts that say more about the expert tools. I mean, there are only 4 references to curves in the whole book, and there are just a huge section on applying filters that you get a better picture of using the HELP menu. I am just very disappointed. I think they need to reevaluate the level of this book."
2,I don't think it is worth it,"I have a few books on Photoshop, and this is the worst of them. It is disorganized, impossible to find what I need, and generally lacks a lot of technique that can be found in other books. There is some stuff you can use, but it is so hard to ferret out that I don't think it is worth it."
3,"More esoteric manipulations than ""meat and potatoes""","The title is misleading in that it suggests that the book covers the Adobe PS 5 LE (Limited Edition) that usually ships with some scanners and color printers. It covers only the full version 5 and dwells heavily on very advanced techniques. For buyers of hardware just getting started in image processing, this is not the book to get. For more advanced users it gives a lot of advanced techniques plus some clipart, and other images that one could do without. Probably included so as to distinguish it from the raft of other PS5 books on the market.The author, when critiqued about the somewhat confusing title, launched into an extremely defensive mode blaming others for being ""misleading"".In all, a fair book with a very good discussion on outputting (pre-press, imagesetters, printers, recorders, etc.)"
2,Needs Serious Proofreading and Editing,"Based on all the favorable reviews, I bought this book, but it has proved a BIG disappointment! There are so many errors in the book that I've found myself constantly going to the Boutons' website to find out what should be there that's not (at least, the website has the correct information). Also, I hate books that simply tell you to ""click this"" and ""click that"" without explaining the underlying concepts. Key stroke shortcuts are great, but understanding what is actually going on is even better. More than anything, though, the book needs proofing; for example, Figure 4.20 supposedly shows the ""Add Layer Mask"" button location, but, in fact, what's shown is the ""Add New Layer"" button. Sure, the writing is breezy andchatty, but I'd rather have a well-edited book with thorough explanations."
3,"Nice Course Book, but little use as a reference","If you're ready to sit down and work through the book like a course, this would work great. The different topics are specifically written for the projects on the CD-ROM. As I worked through the book I felt there had to be more info than just 'do this' and 'do that'. I wanted to know why I 'did this' and 'that'. Not much substance to the workings of Photoshop."
5,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"Simply put, this book is all you need to know about the know-hows, and how-to's of using one of the best graphics program to date. This book covers everything from restoring old hierloom photographs to creating movie-like special effects on exisiting images. There is even a section on how to combine images to create a surrealistic enviroment. This simple step-by-step, illustrated guide along with the book's accompanying CD is, in my opnion, the only companion you need to start ""Photoshopping"" like a pro!"
2,Passable.,The book ocvers a lot of teritory but it looks at things too piecemeal and doesn't do the best job of putting it all together. I had to buy a few other companion texts to make things make sense or to get an idea of how to put through a compelete project.
2,Don't Buy This!,"I was dissapointed to find that the two disks which come with the book contain nothing but example images and the Bouton's clip art. Who needs it? I was expecting a tutorial! Otherwise the book is illogically laid out and starts with much more complicated concepts when it should start with selections, paths, layers, etc. There is a total lack of explanation for WHY you are doing certain things, only ""click here then click here"" which teaches you very little. The 'breezy, chatty"" style of commentary becomes annoying after you realize that that's all you're getting!"
3,"Be forewarned: ""Limited Edition"" it is NOT","If you buy this book to help you with Photoshop 5.0 LE that came with your printer or scanner; you WILL have trouble following the examples. The text pertains to the FULL version of Photoshop, not the limited edition. Sometimes you can work around that, but many times the advanced features are crucial to the lesson."
1,This book is NOT about Adobe Photoshop 5 Limited Edition,"I've never seen the term ""Limited Edition"" used in the way it is here. The book might be very good, but people looking for help to to learn Adobe Photoshop 5 Limited Edition will not find it here. The book is ONLY about the full version of Adobe Photoshop 5."
2,Sits on my bookshelf,"I purchased this book a year and half ago while taking a photoshop class to supplement classroom in a book. I am starting to go back to this book and try to learn. However, the pictures and examples are aesthetically repulsive that it is hard to get inspired doing the work or getting ideas to be creative. The book is extremley fat in a bad way that it seems intimdating to pick up and go over. I just sat down and tried to do one exercise and I could not figure out what the other was trying to explain. I think people have different ways of learning and some may be more patient than I. I wish I could sell this book because it doesn't get much use."
5,Dreamweaver MX: The Missing Manual,"The tittle of this book says it all and it's not kidding . I have an associate degree in art in Internet Services Technology and I code by hand using a variety of languages such as VB.NET ,C#, Actionscript, etc ,and own a lot of programming books ,but I write my code using Dreamweaver as a tool and the The Missing Manual as a resource. I have found information in this book that is not even in advanced dedicated programming manuals so it is allways the first book that I grab when I get stuck. My personal website photo gallery:http://www.sigmacumlaude.com was ,coded using a combination of asp.net and Flash MX Pro. The process was much facilitated by referencing The Missing Manual and I recomend it to any web programmer of any level ."
3,This book does the best it can with a bug ridden product,"If you have to use Dreamweaver MX, this book will help you.Dreamweaver MX itself is a buggy mess that will create more work for developers who use it than it saves. None of its highly touted features such as browser compatability checking, WYSIWIG, and publishing work very well. Not to mention all the hangs/crashes. PHP and Database support got done just enough to trick people into trying it, then you are stuck unless you toss your site out and start over."
2,Hot Garbage,"I mean when you are DJ Clue and this is your third installment I should not be the first reviewer and this has been out since ... Clue needs to work on bringing more mature lyrical material to his set. I mean the by now he should have learned how to tastefully express his most intimate desires. Although, he is not an MC if it is his project his is actually reaffirming the messages spoken on the record. And these selected MC's are straight talkin about much of nothing and I am disappointed."
5,Ouvertures,"Timely, inexpensive, good quality. The purchase was well-worth it! I would recommend this vendor and am very pleased with the product."
1,Opposite efffect,I have occasional very minor psoriasis and wanted a natural product to relieve it. This product made it worse!
4,Great to have,"Super deal, seems to be missing some of the answers, but still very worth getting. It helps to have it when doing the exercises."
1,TOTAL BS FOR SURE,"TOTAL TRASH.....MILLIONS OF WORDS HAVE BEEN WASTED ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS ACTIVITIES BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER 9/11. NOT ONE OF YOU HAS BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE ONE THING. PERIOD. GORE LOST TO HIM IN 2000, KERRY LOST TO HIM IN 2004, YOU CAN'T IMPEACH HIM, AND YOU CAN'T STOP THE WAR. YOU'VE ALL WASTED EVERYONE'S TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE FOR YEARS. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS DO SOMETHING POSITIVE WITH YOUR TIME? WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR ARMED FORCES THAT ARE SPILLING THIER GUTS EVERYDAY TO GIVE YOU THE TIME WRITE THIS JUNK"
1,Beyond the pale!!!!,"This book represents the greatest potential waste of your time and money imaginable.The author clearly presents his blather from a fully leftist position and then expects the reader to swallow it as some hidden ""fact"".Save your money and as importantly save your time."
5,Captivating and Clever,"This book was not my first exposure to paleoanthropology, but until I read this I wasn't very interested. However, Lubenow presents his book in a captivating and fairly easy to read style, considering the complexity of the topic. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in athropology."
4,Evolutionists had it coming!,"This book is very informing. I recommend this book to anyone who has a vested interest in the subject of origins. If you are a creationist, this book will strengthen your faith in God. If you are an atheistic evolutionist, it will leave you shaking in your boots(If you are honest)! One thing that I wish the author would have dealt with more is on the KNM-ER 1813 fossil. This has been a fossil of much controversy, even among creationists....Otherwise, this book is a MUST READ!"
5,"A must for anyone interested in ""Evolution!""","Dr. Lubenow provides a detailed exposé on the fallacy of ""Evolution."" He defends Creationism with scholarly professionalism and exposes the ""Science of Evolution"" for the fraud that it is. It is the most complete critique of the fossils of the ""ape-men."" The last chapter, ""Adam and the Evangelical"" calls the church to repentance for it's compromise on this subject.It is a must read for all Christian and non-Christian alike!"
4,"Well written and thought out, but could use more detail.","This book is a very pleasant surprise on the topic. Painfully honest, yet clearly written with well supported facts, Mr. Lubenow has done a great job at concisively telling a very complex collection of facts in a way that scientist and layman can equally benefit. His dedication to the truth is evident in his writing, but leaves you thirsting for more detail in a number of areas. Overall a very good book indeed and I hope he follows it up with a more detailed version in the future."
1,Really Bad Science,"I grew up with this perspective, was taught it in school, and finally rejected when I discovered: 1.) the dishonesty in the ""smoke and mirrors"" affect imployeed by creationists' dealing with the facts 2.) the lack of even anything like adequate credentials by such authors 3.) the overwhelming and sheer MASS of data confirming evolution (all but ignored) and the scientific intergrity of its method contra creationists' claims. I myself am a theistic evolutionist (of the ""Robust Formational Economy Principle"" persuasion). However, had I not had a quite mature faith in, and experience of, God's grace before discovering these things, I would have certainly become an atheist or agnostic through reading creationist literature."
1,Where's the credentials?,"Hmm, you'd think for such a paradigm breaking book Lubenow would have the credentials necessary for this critical analysis. No, Ph.D. in anthropology (or even in the biological sciences for that matter), no published peer-reviewed journal articles dealing with the issue at hand. If he's so correct in this, why didn't he ever submit his work to the scientific journals (where REAL science is done afterall)? He must be afraid of honest criticsim, that's why you publish to those who already agree with you, it's called preaching to the choir.oh wait, it's probably because of the conspiracy...yeah that's it."
1,This book should be ignored.,I read this book and was simply amazed that people obsess so much over such insignificant detail in order to support thier beliefs. Beliefs have no place in scientific thought.
1,Convincing...,"if you are a scientific illiterate. Lubenow's assessment of the fossils doesn't even agree with other creationists. Hopefully, anyone interested in the topic will seek out some books by actual paleontologists and paleoanthropologists, and maybe even read an actual scientific paper or two. Lubenow has one ax to grind, his religion. It's not science."
4,Not all that is gold glitters,"As a publishing and practising physician, I was impressed by this book. Despite its popular tone and its casual observations, its strengths should not be underestimated - he cites some of the best contemporary work with critical familiarity, unveils some hideous flaws of reasoning and practice in standard works, and shines valuable insights into the field. Well worth studying objectively."
1,unbelievable!,"Maybe not quite as incompetent as Behe or Gish, but nonetheless Lubenow does not have a leg to stand on. Perhaps if he actually attempted to understand evolution without letting his religion get in the way, he might be able to be a competant author. Why do creationists have such need to preach to their own choir? Could it be that deep down they know their religion is merely mythology? They would rather mis-educate our children than admit they were wrong. Dont waste your time with this tripe. Go read some Gould or Dawkins."
2,Great Ideas did not translate to a great product.,"Sound from this unit is fair...nothing to call home about. In the Washington, DC where the station frequencies are quite crowded, tuning in to my favorite stations is impossible. My boss has an older Philips unit that tunes in with no problem. The units are separated by about 20 feet and are both sitting in windows on the same same side of the building. If you intend to use the radio, forget this unit."
4,JVC RCEZ38 Boombox,"Good sound, usb slot for thumb drives, plays mp3 cds too. Nice to have a tape deck, remote. Happy, happy, happy."
3,flexible but...,"the audio response goes down to maybe 90 hz. the hiend is a bit better since it has dedicated tweeters.this box is very flexible because it can play any typeof regular or compressed cd, usb thumb drive, radio,and cassette. it will display the id3 tags, but notregular cd text. there is buttons for sound eq butthey really only make the hi end flat or emphasized.the volume and distortion is acceptable. the remote isdecent, you can turn it on and off using it. eventhough there is no separate memory battery, my unitseemed to retain the fm presets just fine afterunplugging it for a few seconds to move from one roomto another. the front lcd is about 2 x 3 inches andglows a nice backlit blue while plugged into ac.maybe coulda gotten a 4 if it had decent internalports to enhance the bass."
1,Not good (small size),"I bought 2 sizes.As we do crossfit, it's an excellent product and I know it as I use it myself.I bought it to my wife and my daughter 2 different sizes, medium and small.My concern about the small is, where you put the fingers, one if it, was teared up so she don't have 2 holes for the fingers but only one.It does look like it was forced to make the hole bigger but too much strength was applied and it burst.The medium size is perfect.I still recommend the product, but wasn't satisfied with the small size."
1,"Too small, seems cheap",The sizing was way off and it just was not what I thought it was going to be. But the return was easy.
1,Worst Book Ever,The author is extremely ineffective in assisting anybody in overcoming an overactive conscience. He frequently uses non inclusive language and reinforces homophobia to the extreme. The advise he gave to some of his patients were not God-like in nature at all. There are more effective books out there. This book was written in the 90's and it's clearly outdated.
3,meh,"I bought this book two years ago to prep for the compsci GRE. Didn't use it. It's okay, but I didn't take the GRE and still got into my top grad school."
3,not her best,"this is definitely not up to par for Carly Phillips .... you start mid-story it seems, and the pacing is messy - by the first meeting Zoe and Ryan are holding hands, next day, they are making out, yet these are two responsible, yet wounded and wary adults?Read the Bachelor series instead"
2,Having a hard time finishing.....,Usually Carly Phillips books are a quick read for me but I am having a very hard time finishing this book. I did not find the story interesting enough to want to see what happens next. I don't know if I will even finish it.
3,There are better CP books out there,It was too much like a silly romance 'quick reads' with no depth to the characters or relationships for me. I struggled to get it read- part of me wanted to put it down and going on to another book but I did finish it. I really don't know if I would recommend it. Its not a bad read - but there is just some many better ones out there.
2,where was the summer fun?,"I've enjoyed Carly Phillips other novels, but this one just didn't get very interesting. I just didn't buy into the plot about the long lost uncle posing as a social worker. And the idea that a 17 year old drug addict somehow managed to discover all the wrong doings with the mob and her family's company didn't seem very realistic either. Neither Zoe or Ryan made me love them very much. It was a fine read for passing the time on a car trip, but I'm very glad that I checked it out from the library and didn't have to pay for a hardcover book. Wait for the paperback."
4,Pretty good read,"This book was a pretty good read. It started off being pretty interesting, sagged in the middle and picked up with a little bit of mystery thrown in at the end."
2,Summer Snoozin',"I don't know if I just didn't like this story or if I just don't like Carly Phillips very much. This story did nothing for me. I didn't like Zoe very much, she was kind of hard to understand. I understood that she loved Sam and wanted her to be part of the family but she was very shady with Ryan in my opinion and from how far I read didn't always respect Ryan's feelings for his niece. She kind of threw her close relationship with Sam in his face all the time. And Ryan started out good but the social worker mix-up which wasn't really his fault kept being brought back up by Zoe and his angry moods and stodgy attitude turned me off. It was too boring to actually finish reading it. Maybe it redeemed itself in the end for other readers. But based on the premise and the poor execution I give it 2 stars."
2,Very Disappointed...,"After reading Under the Boardwalk I ordered this book and was very excited to read it. However, this book disappointed greatly. There was no character development, especially in the relationship between Zoe and Ryan. Phillips stated exactly what the character's emotions and feelings were, leaving no room for your own insight and feel for the characters. As an avid chick-lit reader, this was one of the worst books I have read in a long time."
1,Worked only once!,"I used this smoothie machine once, and it made a nice smoothie. The second time it locked up and I could smell something burning in the motor. I used the exact measurements for liquids and frozen fruit, so I'm confident I didn't do anything wrong. I sent it back for a refund immediately."
1,Consider this a throwaway :(,"I expected the motor to be the first thing to go, as it smelled like something burning and left a dark residue on the counter where it stood as I used it... but it was the blade assembly that let go after the dozenth or so time of using it. I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did. I can't recommend it, unless you can find it for a lot less and don't expect it to last very long."
1,Piece of Junk,"Only used 3 times. Moter still going, I'll keep my fingers crossed, but everything else keeps breaking. The wand the first time I used it. The buttons work intermittently, and the valve the last time my wife used it."
1,"Don't waste your time, money and ingredients!",I've been through 2 of these BTB smoothie makers. The last one left me with a mess of ingredients in the pitcher....and no smoothie. Spend a little morey and get a durable machine!
1,Junk!!!,"Do not buy this piece of junk! We used it only a few times and then the buttons broke so now it is on all the time as soon as you plug it in. Also, when it did work, it vibrated so much it would have danced right off the table if we didn't hold on to it. Like the other reviews, we also smelled something burning. Don't waste your money. Consumer Reports recommends the Oster BCBG08 in the June 2010 issue."
2,Spigot breaks,"I've had this for several years now. I've never had any problems with the motor or blades and it makes perfectly fine smoothies. However, the spigot has broken at least 5 times and I've had to spend much more on replacement parts and shipping than I did to purchase the smoothie maker. The spigot is cheap. I had one replacement break in 2 weeks, and that's with relatively light use and no drops. It either cracks or the little pins break off. The only place to purchase the replacement parts is from the manufacturer. I don't recommend this product."
1,Received broken one,"Reeived it quickly, but the handle was broken, what a pain... I initiated the return and we will see how quick the replacement comes."
1,The engineers must've been drinking margaritas when designing this...,"TERRIBLE unit. It was a gift from my mother so it wasn't my money that was wasted but I'll bet we only got a few good mixes out of it. Then the valve leaked all over the place, then the valve completely broke off, so we were down to pouring the drinks from the spout - finally just got a better unit. Don't waste your money on this junk..."
1,Another Sorry Recipient....,"I received this Smoothie Elite as a gift. I took it out of the box and plugged it in and it immediately started running (on high). It would not turn off unless you unplugged it!!! None of the buttons did anything!!! The worst product I think I have ever owned!!! I see from the other reviews I am not the only one that was unfortunate enough to have wound up with this junk!!! Since it was a gift, I regifted it..................to the trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,I wish mine would stop working...,"So I've had 2 of these for 7+ years...my husband and I each had one before getting married. I have used one about a few times a month and it is consistently making great smoothies with frozen berries.My only complaints are 1) it is ear-piercingly loud and 2) it's not easy to twist off the bottom to clean the blade and rubber gasket. I have to use a rubber jar opener to get a tight enough grip to twist off.I keep wishing they would die so I could get something new!! But I haven't found a promising replacement, so my son knows when I'm making us smoothies to cover his ears when I warn him ""loud noise""! It really is ear piercing. Both of them!!"
3,Worth The Money,"This is a very good unit, my wife and I use it several times a week and when friends are over. We only use it for frozen Margarita's and its never failed us. My wife says it needs to have a Bigger container when you are serving up three or four at a time, and the tap drips, other than that its a bargain."
4,Smoothies,This is my second smoothie maker. I have one in our camper and wanted one for the house. Love it!!
3,"Would make a good textbook, but that's it.","As soon as I removed this book from the box and opened it I knew this was not what I was expecting and it did not take long for me to decide to return it. I think it would make a very good textbook for a college class on American maritime history, but as far as being a book I would have looked at time and time again for enjoyment, this was not one of them."
2,Extremely difficult to handle though interesting.,Book is too massive to hold while reading. Pages not sequential due to frequent insertions of other articles and reproductions. Good nautical history but doesn't flow . A difficult read and practically impossible in bed.
2,"Great idea, but...","It is a great idea to publish a book like this. When I received this book I was happy, but a few minutes later I was already disappointed. I own a few actual statistics from the same company (Moore Research Center) and couldn`t believe, that they have hidden the most important statistics. For example feeder cattle: in their statistic they published 2 trades with a winning chance of 100 %. In this book they published zero! For example lean hog: in their statistic: 9 trade-opportunities with a winning chance of 100 %. In this book: only 2! They filled this book with 80 % chances. I don`t know, why they have hidden the higher chances?! Somehow I have the impression, this company don't want to tell us the trades with the highest probability. What a pity!"
5,Worth the Money,"I bought this book when it was first published a few months ago. I have been paper trading the more simple spreads. I have ignored the ratio spreads and the ones that seem to use 2 different commodites that appear to be unrelated. I have several open now, but of the closed trades, so far, 8 wins and 6 losses and a gain of over $7,000. This does not have commission or slippage deducted. I have been just blindly entering and exiting on the dates they show in the book. If you use a strategy like Joe Ross teaches in his book, some of the losing trades could have been avoided entirely. I am almost ready to start trading real money."
4,A must have,Every spreader should probably have this book on his shelf. it reviews over 200 seasonal spreads in the commodities and financial futures.
4,"Crunchy, crunchy, crunchy!","This popcorn has a lot of crunch but the kernals are small (well, it is ""Little Dove"" popcorn). The only brand better is Orville Redenbacher's WHITE popping corn (not microwave, just the kernals) but it's very hard to find and Amazon doesn't carry it yet. That stuff is the greatest. Fluffy, large kernals with virtually none of those hard hulls. Look for it online, but Paloma is a good second best."
4,Never buy batteries again!,"A very nice, stylish Casio watch. Good quality, loads of features (like a data bank) and it is solar powered! Doesn't take much sun to run it at all, after two years the power bar has never gone off full. The only drawback is the usual one for Casio watches, the hopeless and cheap rubber strap that breaks after 6 months. Still, that is easily replaced with a nice leather one. Overall, a very nice everyday watch that won't need batteries changing."
2,My Review,"Personally, the whole thing was too stereotypical for me. Now, I will admit that I'm not usually into what other people are. If you like something like Inuyasha, you might like this.The story was the same thing that you'll find in most anime. The character's aren't anything special, and the basis of the storyline had been used so many times...The only reason I even slightly liked this game was because they artwork in it is pretty well done. It also included voices, which is [almost] always good.Mostly it was because I liked the whole idea of gaining mana points and fusing things together and what not.If you can find it at a pretty low price, then [maybe] it'd be worth looking at as something to do when you're stuck on one all of your other games."
3,Taught it would be good,"I bought this because i wanted my favorite color and i wanted to buy it in bulk, when i recieved this product, i ate a few and i found out that it wasnt as fresh as i taught it would be, it seemed like it was sitting on the shelves for a pretty long time. I can be sure that the quality is much much better if i bought it at [...], but it has other flavors included. I recommend this if it was fresh also the price is good too."
4,"Fresh, Fast, Flavorful","Slightly disappointed by the flavor sent, it was not the pure strawberry, it was strawberry mix with a mystery flavor. We wanted the Strawberry flavor because it is what the kinds like the best and it can be hard to find in the store. It's not Amazon's fault it's all on Betty Crocker, they come up with these awful mixed flavor sets every so many months. But I do have to say this looks like very new batch of FBTF, no stale packing as one reviewer mentioned. (I only really wrote this review to let everyone know it is fresh)If it had not been for the mystery flavor I would give this 5 stars, we have it on subscription now hopefully the next batch will be as fresh and back to the normal flavor."
5,Psychology must be a Science,"When the psychologist decide to leave the mentalistic culture and take the science and statistical methods as tool for work, then our history will change. Before was Fisher, Gosset, Skinner an so on., and now is the moment to give the oportunity for J. D Truot's book to remember our responsability.I recommend it without fear."
5,Excellent Job,"This company was very quick with delivery and I was impressed by their professionalism throughout the entire process. I would definitely purchase from them in the future for any shirts. The shirt I received was true to the size, thick and not cheap looking. Thank you!"
4,Almost tries too hard,"Although I loved this movie, it was almost like someone just thought of a bunch of one liners and wrote a script around it. The casting was a little odd for me, seeing Paulo Costanzo in a role that required him to be the straight-laced one. However, putting J.K. Simmons in it makes everything wrong with the movie somehow become right."
4,good and funny,I enjoyed this movie . Really liked Scott Caan part.He did a good job. The movie is sad and very funny.
1,Stereotypes Inc.,"Seen thirty times told before movie stereotypes of loser dad with lots of former wives (by various stereotyped marriages - hooker, Asian, etc.); gambles; self-centered to the point of making money off of his kids by enrolling them in, a supposedly for profit, drug testing program. Dad commits suicide (off screen) and so we follow his stereotypic kids, starting with the funeral, and as mostly adults with a variety of stereotypic dysfunctional personality quirks - selfish; non-commital; anal; not-so-bright; angry. All given unbelievable, over the top, characterizations. The usual boring traits you can look inside or across the street and see. As predicted everyone gets their individual acts together and everyone lives happily ever after. It was suppose to have some comical elements but they were all barely little snicker-laughs; about the same substance level as watered down non-fat milk."
4,Just what I needed,"I was desperate for ideas that would help me make my students talk and this book has helped me a lot since day one. Easy to use, well-organised and with plenty of useful ideas that actually work."
3,The Novelty Wore Off,Overall a pretty good read. The novelty of the writing style from Phoenix Guards has worn off but the plot did improve over Phoenix Guards. Based on these two books I'm sure I'll get around to reading more of Brust's work in the future.
3,"Not as good as Vlad, but still Steven Brust","I found this book to be entertaining, action packed and well written. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy the vald series, but it's still a great story. The style he wrote it in was refreshing from the usual blabbing of other fantasy books. I can't wait to read more of his writings."
3,Comfortable but thin material,"I loved this when I breastfed my first daughter so I bought some more for my second time around. It is very comfortable and the pull down design provides easy access to breastfeeding. Great to sleep in. However, since you have to pull it over your head to put it on and off, it does get stretched. The material does give in after awhile to the constant stretching (holes and lose stitching). It's basically a sports bra design but without the support."
1,Won't stay in place,"I normally wear a 32B (have been fitted several times, so not confused about size). Ordering a 32 in this bra made sense. I assumed, based on the sizing method, and the fact that the bra is made of a thin stretchy cotton, that band size was the only thing of importance. I tried it on and the straps were so short that I could not keep the bra in place. It kept slipping up over my chest. I had already removed the tag and tossed it, assuming there was no way this wouldn't fit. So disappointed."
1,Not any different than 1st editon!,This a rehash of the first edition with little change. If you have the 1st edition don't waste your money. 2003? How about a new one?!
4,Video study guide,This was a big help understanding the basics. i could use the video for review. I only wish this came on DVD.
3,Not Worth $160,"I bought this massager based solely on the description and pictures I found on the web. I just couldn't find any decent reviews on foot massagers so I took a chance and ordered the one that ""looked"" the best to me.When I opened the box and plugged it in, I was surprised to find out that there were no moving parts. Looking at the picture, I assumed that the individual pressure point knobs vibrated or that the middle part would move independantly somehow to massage the arches. Unfortunately, nothing moves independantly. It is just a big vibrating box. For $160, I expected A LOT more.If you simply want a vibrating foot massager, go spend $20 at your local department store. You will get the same effect and save a lot of money."
5,This is great!,"I bought this as a present for my mother but tried it first to be sure it was worth the money. It really is! After using this the recomended 15 minuets, my feet felt just like they did when I had a professional foot massage! I highly recomend this for anyone who enjoys having thier feet massaged."
5,693 jokes and still loving it,"This book is a compromasation of zany knock knock zingers that no child should be without. If you like comedy or such movies as, caddyshack, gremlins, battleship potempkin, carwash, burn hollywood burn, or springtime for hitler, then you cant go without buying this book. It is comedy through repetition. i bought this book for .20 cents in a poor resale shop in a bad neighborhood and now ive changed my opinion of the neighboorhood and am considering movie there due to the absolute hilarity of these classic knock knock jokes."
2,heating element died (melted at plug) after 2nd time,"I loved the idea of the electric heating. The ""ease"" of temperature control, etc... but the heating element melted. The plastic part of it did anyway... right where it conects to the metal bent ""rod"" that creates the heat to burn the wood chips.It also was a pain to constantly snug the wood chips (even tried the chunk type woods) against the heating element. Which ment I had to balance the housing, the water bowl, etc. just to get where the heating element was at.I don't know about other electric smokers, but this on ""stank"".Just get one with a smoker box on the side... toss in some coals, wood... whatever... as needed. Don't try to make the unit too ""scientific""."
2,Nice smoker BUT,I have had this smoker since August and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it. I noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless.The other problem I have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed.Dealing with Charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless.At the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered I would pass for something better
1,"Broken out of the box, and Charbroil doesn't care","After experiencing the same thing that many on here have witnessed (after 8 hours the smoker didn't get hot enough, and I had to finish my meat in the oven), I decided to ask Char-broil support on their website what I can do to remedy the situation.Their answer, and I quote, ""Thank you for your response. To purchase replacement parts, please contact Grill Lover's at 1-800-241-8981 24 hours a day 7 days a week to place an order. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know.""WHAT?? They expect you to purchase a replacement part in order for their POS smoker to actually work?? What's a warranty worth?? BEWARE - this thing is worthless without some modification or purchasing expensive spare parts."
3,Good smoker for the price...,"Just what the title says. It's a good smoker for the price. You WILL get smoked foods if used properly, and it is easy to use. The two complaints that I do have is that when your bottom rack is full, it's difficult to add water to the pan. Adding charcoal is easy, but because of the placement of the inside bottom rack, it's very difficult to add water. The second complaint is that the lid doesn't fit. I think it's more of a quality control issue than a bad product, but gaps can let heat escape and cause for irregular cooking temps.If you're new to the art of ""cue"" and don't want to invest a bunch, it's a good buy. If you have experience, you may want something else."
2,I expected better quality.,"I am not really happy with this smoker so far. I know it is not top of the line, and not rocket science. The outside finish seems very durable, but...the paint is peeling off the inside of the lid and inside of the barrel after the first use. I expect it will begin to rust fairly quickly now. Shame on me for not keeping my receipt. I would take it back and buy a different brand.Furthermore, I am not crazy about the reflector shield, used on the bottom of the unit. Place the wood chips around the element,on the shield and...some of them smolder, some of them don't.The last model I owned (I think it was a Weber, for over 10 years) used lava rocks surrounding the electric coil. Then spread the chips around the lava rocks. Seemed to work a lot better."
2,Char-Broil H2O smoker,"I was very dissapointed with this smoker. I have the same complaints that other have. The temparture does not get hot enough to cook properly, the shield does not distribute heat very well so some of the wood chips burn up and others don't even smoke, the paint peeled off the inside of the cooking chamber and lid, it draws so many amps that it keep poping my breaker, the lid doesn't fit tight so heat and smoke escape...Mines on the way to the dump."
2,poor quality construction,"Fit and finish is so-so at best. The top lid does not fit at all. There is a 1/2 inch gap all around the top. How is it supposed to keep the smoke in if there is such a gap? Also the temperature gauge does not have degrees, only warm - ideal - hot. I need a gauge with degrees to insure proper temp. The thermostat kept coming loose causing irregular heat at best. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,don't buy,We are on our second Charbroil Electric Smoker! The thermostat cords have melted down on both smokers we have purchased. We will not buy one more Charbroil Smoker!
1,I agree - Don't buy it!,"About half way through assembling this smoker, I realized the legs were missing from the package. I called customer service, and they told me the legs were on back orde, and that I would most likely recieve them in 10-14 working days. Furthermore, the lid does not fit snuggly. There is about a 1/4 inch gap. I read the positive reviews on amazon.com which convinced me to purchase this particular smoker. I wish I hadn't."
1,waste of money,"I have to agree with the bad reviews, I used this smoker 6 times and the element burned out ,of course a replacement was 40.00. I purchased it new on sale for 65.00. It is now a charcoal smoker.Unless you have money to burn!I would not recomend this item."
5,I'm on my 3rd one..Love it!,"I've worn out my previous two Char Broil Electric Smokers. I use the **** out of them, especially for smoking Salmon."
2,Not what I expected,"I normally dont write reviews but this time I am. I purchased this case with the 10 dollar promotional discount the company was giving out. I thought this would be a decent case for 11 dollars. When I got the case it is very thin and flimsy. Which is great if you want a sleek case. The case is a good quality case,The reason I gave it two stars is do to the fact that the case is way overly priced. I purchased a case from ebay that was less than 2 dollars and its the same quality as this case. This is why I would not recommend the case,if the price drops then it will be worth it but right now its not worth the 11 dollars."
5,covers,They are very durable and stylish I would by them again and I would definitely recommend them to all my friends.
2,Buttons make case unusable,"The case's appearance, the feel, the rubber on the edges , and the fit is nice. The phone feels secure and safe in the case.....but the button's make the case unusable. You need to press the power button pretty hard for it to register - and you can barely feel the button being pushed. There are times the sound buttons get stuck and you need to wiggle the case a bit for it to get unstuck. I loved how the case looks, but found the case not up to standards since the side buttons are awful. I ended purchasing another case for the phone (Case-Mate tough case). Not much thicker and way better feel, and the buttons are superb. I would NOT recommend the BoxWave S3 Duosuit case since the buttons are absolutely awful."
4,Works,"It protects the phone. It fits snug. It doesn't add much size. The the buttons are fairly easy to push through the plastic. Is it an Otterbox? No. Is it a better value than an Otterbox? Unless you are into extreme sports, probably."
3,"Great case, but hard to charge my phone","I still can't decide if I like this case because of the hassles with plugging in my charger. Luckily this case is a sturdy, thick rubberlike material with some flex to it. I'll break down the pros & cons.PROS:#1 The grrip on the sides that are amazing!#2 FULL coverage protection of the phone#3 Sturdy, slightly flexible material (unlike a breakable hard case)CONS:#1 The cut out for the power port isn't aligned right & plugging in the power cord is a BIG hassle.#2 The case covers the power & volume buttons, but is a thinner rubberlike substance***I actually having the buttons covered (I bump the buttons too easily, so this is kind of a plus)"
3,Ok for daily protection,"Just got this case- it will do for everyday wear and tear but will not protect against dropping. I bought this case as I like the look of the phone and most cases impeded this view. The case is soft plastic so it will only protect against scratches and dings but I figured that when I bought it. The sides have grip texture which is a plus as this is a slippery phone and most cases that I have seen do not have this feature. Right away I noticed that the power button is a bit hard to depress when in this case, volume buttons work ok. I don't have a car dock so I couldn't tell you if this would fit or not. All in all, a decent price for a decent case."
2,So So,"I used it for a while, didn't like and then I changed to a different cover. This cover feels bulky and the cut offs are not centered. Also it's hard to feel/operate the volume and power off buttons. Waste of $10."
5,folklore and memories from the past,"Although, stereotypes can be dangerous and misleading, this film carries a wonderful set of scenarios that show episodes from an era when Mexico was considered only a rural, narrow minded, simplistic, humorous, and easy to handle society, which it is not longer true. Films like this, created a generic view of Mexico that influenced many and presented a local urban window of a country not every one knew. The magnificent ideas of collecting traditional tales from Mexico by the well known author B. Traven in 1956, brought to light a set of stories in black and white that match perfectly the period during the fifties when Mexico was passing the golden era in film. This is a film that contains heroines and heroes, and at the same time, it shows a variety of genres, drama, comedy, action, and it is presented in its original language. I love it and recommended to others!"
1,Are you kidding?,"I got this one free with my copy of the DVD along with Mator, Doc and McQueen. Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us have a ton of these for less than $3.60! These are great toys and widely available. The one star over all rating is for the seller!"
3,Good for the experienced mechanic,"gives a good idea of what to expect when tearing and engine apart, but doesn't illustrate it part by part, must study systems and relationships to understand full system. Don't buy this book if your not willing to take your engine apart!"
5,Totally captivating and breathtaking.,"This book is an excellent book for worldwide gymnastics fan. Kerri Strug gives an account of the rise and falls, ups and downs, and most captivating moments of her gymnastics career. She talks about the rough, but loving relationship she has with her coach Bela Karolyi. She talks about training at several gyms to eventually reach her bittersweet goal. I think we all remember that July night in 1996. Buy it today!!!"
3,Nice cutting but not half of what it could have been,"Remember when Ed introduced Judy Carne as Judy Crane, or when he said to Jack Benny (in a sketch) that he made 800 *million* dollars a year? There's nothing like that here - just ""outrageous"" stuff i.e. imperfect acrobatics, Ed singing and clowning, and slightly agitated lions that Clyde Beautty has to subdue.We've all seen that bizarre clip of Ed interviewing audience celebrities while the sound of gunshots are heard. The best part of this DVD actually explains the situation, which to my knowledge has always left the viewer in suspense on earlier TV Specials and videos.One would surmise that an *amazing* DVD could be compiled with good-natured and quite hilarious clips of the Toast of Broadway. We all have fond recollections of that ""stone face"" which could change in a milli-second in response to some really outrageous circumstance."
4,Great fun to watch !!,My parents bought this DVD for my 17 year old daughter who was in the play Bye Bye Birdie and they often joked about Ed Sullivan. I would have never believed it but she and her boyfriend sat down and watched it and were completely entertained. They wanted to know if we could get more and said that tv should bring back the variety show. Everything from Gene Kelly to balancing plates to an unhappy lion or two. It was great fun to watch
4,My ISOBLOK surge protector,Using this for a laser printer protection device. Installed quick and easy. I liked the reset button capability. I am using the ISOBLOCK on a separate power circuit from my main electrical breaker power feed (due to amperage draw from the laser printer).
3,Sony = the Bose of PCs!,"By which I mean that their products are very attractive-looking but also very overpriced, overhyped, and totally dependent saleswise on the huge (and expensively maintained) brand-name recognition.However to be fair, Sony unlike Bose does at least publish full specs on all of its computers, where Bose doesn't even tell you how many watts per channel its audio stuff is! And Sony isn't quite THAT bad for computers, just notoriously unreliable.My wife was given one of these computers at work and it has been constantly in the shop!I have worked in IT for over 20 years and the machines that we spend the most time repairing are Sony VAIOs and Compaqs/HPs.My advice is, if you're on a budget go with Dell and if you have more money to spend buy a Toshiba or IBM. Sony needs to concentrate on making TVs which it's still very good at!"
3,Sony FS550-,"This is a great computer, but you will have trouble when converting 8mm video Cassetes from Sony Camcorder with out the I.Link 4 pin to 4 pin. I had to buy Pinaccle Software and Accessories to hook the 3 pin connector from the Video Camera via USB port to my Laptop. Check the battery life which was like 1.5 hours whith the low resolution mode on.Sony does not advertise this product anymore and you will have trouble when you look for FS550 on the Sony Website!!.:-)"
1,no way,"Want a sony? Please, please for your own good take the time to read these following links. Thank you. My goal is to protect consumers from the problems that I and others have faced.http://www.hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/5449/?o=0http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?sonymem1"
2,"Good idea, poor execution","It is HEAVY. I'm not a small man, and it is a pain to vacuum a 2-story carpeted house. In addition, the combination of height adjustment and drive system seems to work badly. The beater brush stalls in thick (but short) plush carpeting, making an already unwieldy machine very hard to get off dead center. The net effect is that the drive belts squeal and smell of burning rubber in a way that reminded me of my sons' early driving days. The suction is great, and the hand-held attachment is the only useful stair device I've seen (but only when combined with the accessory extension hose). Next time I'll opt for the British R2D2 look-alike."
1,Belt continues to fall off,"I just bought this vacuum's sister, U6432-900. I turned it on with the self-propel mode ""on"". I pushed gently as directed in the owner's manual, and the flat (wide) belt fell off within a couple of pushes. It seems that there is nothing to stop the belt from falling off the motor shaft. I don't know if the problem just occurs in the ""2"" model or not."
2,Works Great...When It Works,"There is no question this vacuum has power and it cleans like no other vacuum I've used before. The problem is that, once again, it is sitting ready to go to the repair shop and the floor will have to wait. Did I say once again? More like five times again. Switch, self-propel, belts...I am fed up and planning on getting a Kenmore Progressive. Someday I'll have it repaired (again)and use it in the garage."
4,One Great Vacuum!,"We have had our Hoover U6430-900 WindTunnel for almost a year now. It has proven to be a very reliable and worthy vacuum. It has excellent suction power and does a 1st rate job of getting the dirt out of our carpets. I especially like the attached hose w/ provided tools. It does a great job of cleaning up the ashes from around our wood stove as well as hair from haircuts. The self propelled feature works flawlessly also and is very nice since this is a heavy vacuum. The weight of this vacuum spells ""quality""."
1,Cheap Parts,"Hoover now cuts many corners with there vacuum cleaners. If you pick up the machine with the handle, the cord that controls the power assist will break. This is what happened to me. I bought a new cable only to find out that what the cable was attached to was also broke. It was cheap plastic where metal should be. I am handy so I have taken this apart many times and fixed time and time again."
1,WORST VACUUM EVER! DO NOT BUY! BOYCOTT HOOVER!,We have had this vacuum for less than a year and the belt has broken 5 times. No joke. My husband and I are so dissapointed we refuse to ever buy another hoover product. And it is heavy. Unusually heavy. How Hoover deemed this product acceptable to sell is beyond me.
1,Stay away from this product,"Bottom line: don't buy this product.We got our Hoover WindTunnel in early September. Used it, twice a week, nothing dramatic. Within one month of purchase, a belt broke. Bought a belt at the Hoover center, fixed it.One month later, the whole machine imploded. Too big to fix on our own. When we took it in, a guy there, shopping for a vacuum, told us that WITHIN THE HOUR he was in the Hoover store, two other customers came in with the WindTunnel and the same problem! He promptly left.Would that we were so lucky. It's been two weeks, and I'm still without a vacuum cleaner. I don't hold out much hope that will change when I get the WindTunnel back. So, four months after we spent three hundred dollars on a brand new vacuum cleaner, we're buying yet another one. Different brand.An incredible disappointment."
2,"Great start, but burned out quickly","My husband and I purchased our Wind Tunnel less than a year ago. We were thrilled when it picked up pet hair so easily! Last week we weren't thrilled when the motor ""burned"" out and our local repair shop said that we may as well get a new vacuum due to the cost of a new motor. The Wind Tunnel isn't exactly an inexpensive vacuum, and for the money we spent we expected it to last longer than 10 months. I wonder if the raters from the consumer magazines that have recommended this vacuum have tried to use it for a longer period of time? We won't ever buy a Wind Tunnel again."
2,Too many problems,"I have only had this vacuum for about 9 months, and have had a number of problems with it. The self-propel switch is very hard to move and often gets stuck. It's also very difficult to change the carpet height adjustment control switch --- it recently broke off. The roller has broken three times. The headlight broke after about 2 months This is all with normal usage --- I vacuum about once a week. I finally got sick of taking it to the repair shop and went out and bought another vacuum cleaner (not a Hoover)!"
3,"Cleans well, but you better be built like Hercules...","I am disappointed in this vacuum. When we got our yellow lab pup the deal was I would get a nice new vacuum to pick up after her. I went online..., investigated the reviews of vacuums in the $200-$300 price range and picked this one. It does a good job picking up the hair but it is INCREDIBLY cumbersome to use. It is VERY heavy, and the hose is VERY short (the 20' ext hose is a MUST). Every time I vacuum I find my vocabulary become more colorful! I am no lightweight, but this vacuum gives me a run for my money. If you're looking for an excuse to NOT do housework - buy this vacuum!"
2,Hoover in the shop,"Mine is in the shop after 2 1/2 months of use. Apparently some clutching mechanism is broken and the carpet beater won't spin. It sounds like the service repair guy and I will become good friends as Hoovers love the repair shop. Knowing what I know now, I would have ignored Consumer Reports and gone stratight to my local vacuum service repair shop for a vacuum cleaner recommendation. I am certain it wouldn't have been a Hoover."
3,Already in the repair shop!,"My new Hoover worked like a dream in the first week. It picked up stubborn dirt, cat hair, and was easy to use. Then a nut fell off the axle that holds the wheel turned by the small belt . . . and I was informed that I'd have to ship the vacuum to the nearest warranty repair place (Charlotte, NC, because I live in Raleigh) AT MY EXPENSE. After one week of use. A brand new vacuum. To be fair, the fellow at the center offered to include some bags when he shipped it back, but still!I found a place closer (funny the Hoover guy didn't know one was right here in town, isn't it?), but am still without my new vacuum cleaner.My Sears Kenmore ran for 17 years with only minor problems. Unless Hoover improves their customer service, it's not likely that my next vacuum will be one of theirs. I get the feeling that my next vacuum will be coming along in much fewer than 17 years . . ."
1,I HATE THIS THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sure it vaccuums just great but the belt breaks so frequently and I have to take the whole vaccuum apart to get to the belt- this takes FOREVER. Then it is hard as hell to put the cover back on. It took me 4 hours and I'll still not done. Hoover has not made it easy or simple to replace the belt and also the roller mechanism that adjusts the vaccuum higher / lower off the floor is a pain in the neck to put back on. It is SOOO FRUSTRATING! ARGHHHH! If it takes too long or you have a hard time putting the vaccum together, return it! Do a test run, try replacing the belt and if this takes more than 5 minutes, RETURN IT! I suggest: STAY AWAY FROM HOOVERS!"
1,Never Again A Hoover!,I purchased this Hoover 6 months ago. I am 50 and recently disabled. Hoover was a name I grew up with and trusted. The trap door that functions with the self-propel broke and the repair shop told me it would be close to $150.00.The shop told me not to invest the $150.00 in repairs since the down-time on Hoovers is extremely high and I would be wasting my money. I can not afford this lack of quality and poor customer service from Hoover or anyone else. As far as I am concerned Hoover should refund or replace this vaccum.NEVER AGAIN A HOOVER!!!
1,Had 2 and both burned up within hours!,"With my first purchase of a Hoover bagless, I was thrilled with the way it picked up dust I didn't know was there - until I decided to empty the container. Static caused it to form all over the front of the sweeper. The next thing I knew the belt or motor (not sure) burnt and the beater-bar wouldn't turn. Took it back for a refund. Purchased the U6430-900 and it did the same thing with the beater bar. Tried to turn it off and it wouldn't turn off! I would like to know if Consumer Reports has stock in this company or does Hoover dontate one made in America?"
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"I have had 2 Hoover vacuum cleaners. Before my Self Propelled Windtunnel, I had a Self-Propelled Breathe Easy. Each vacuum cleaner had a lifespan of 2 years! My mother's Self Propelled Eureka works far better and she's had it far longer than I had my Hoovers. I recently bought a Bissell Bagless vacuum. It's so much cheaper and easier to use, especially if you are a petite person.Pushing each of my Hoovers felt like driving a bus, despite them both being self-propelled. The belts broke, the hard floor/carpet lever broke within days after purchasing my Windtunnel, and the door in which the attachments were encased broke off shortly after I purchased it. The Self Propelled Windtunnel has great suction power, but my Bissell works just as well. If you buy this vacuum cleaner, don't expect it to have a long life. I wil never buy another Hoover after having been through 2 of them in 4 years, both of which cost $... to $... each."
2,Great Cleaning But Not Reliable,I have had it for 2 1/2 years. Cleaned great but on the noisy side. The problem was it died after 2 1/2 years of admittedly infrequent use so I was very disappointed considering it costed me a bit more than [price] which worked out to be more than [price] for each year of use. Not worth it.
2,Complete?,"I've referred to this book several times over the last couple years and it has offered no help. Norton's book is too general to be of any use. I would rather have five books that cover just a few topics with depth and clarity than one book that skims many topics and helps me with none, like this one."
2,Peter Norton's Book,"Too much general information, Not near enough pictures to follow. You need to have had some experience with a computer before trying to use this book. Stick with Anti-Virus software Peter!"
3,import review of the extra song,the extra song is so not worth the price of this cd. Once you hear it you understand why it was left off of the usa version. I'm a big Luther fan and have been trying to get as many rare songs of his as I can but the bonus track is not a keeper.
5,I think you should read The Cut-Ups by James Marshall,because they are really funny and silly. They do silly things. My favorite part of the book was when Mr. Spurgle was the principal again. I am a 2nd grader.
4,I thought it was a really funny book.,"I think you should read The Cut-Ups by James Marshall because it's a good book for me and it's funny, too. I like the book a lot. When they're being so funny because of that girl in the car, that's the best part of all for me. I am a 2nd grader."
4,Good Collection of Classic Music,It's nice when you really like most all the songs on a CD collection. This CD has a nice combination of mellow upbeat classical music that will brighten-up any rainy day. Highly recommended.
4,It's light just like it says,"I really like the light weight feature of this hose which is what I was looking for. I like how it handles as well. I wasn't expecting the lower flow, but I've never had this size before. Seems to work fine for my purposes however."
4,Not to be taken seriously!,This book is geared for entertainment purposes only. There are hardly any theories in the book that could even have possibly happened. It is a good book if you are looking for a laugh but I wouldn't buy it if you are looking for something with a more serious conspiracy theory tone.
2,NOT QUALITY BLUEGRASS I EXPECTED,THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE EXCELLENT LIVELY BLUEGRASS MUSIC I WAS EXPECTING. BUT THE CD IS A POOR MIX OF COUNTRY AND SOME BLUEGRASS.
3,Good fun at a bargain price,"Artwork is good, including a cute princess. Some of the last part of the film is pretty far out, even for a fantasy genre. Small children might be scared by some scenes."
2,Could Be A Lot Better,"I needed a test CD to check some issues on my preamp and this is the only CD of its type that I could find on short notice. Unfortunately, it is in great need of enhancement. What it need is narration to explain and guide the user on what to expect for each test. There are more than 50 different test. Without such improvement, your are left to guess on many test as to results.Bottom line is find a better one, if you can.Paul"
3,Excellent material,"The material on these sheets are great. They are soft and silky but when you buy it in this color, the fitted sheet and pillow cases come in the color shown and the sheet comes in a greenish color. They don't match. So what's the point?"
3,Enjoyable.... Solid but some reservation although not musical ones.,"I'm a big fan of Bruce Hornsby and I enjoyed this performance which is all too brief. The guest stars are welcome. Glad to see Pat Metheny and Don Henley among them. The pieces are all well performed and in many cases differently than in the recorded versions.My problem is one that afflicts too many concerts, that cutting away to a quote during a performance. It ruins the continuity of the piece for me. Given the technology available this intrusion should be an optional estra feature, like the directors narration during a movie."
2,"Put some effort into your releases, Red","Hornsby's great, no doubt; but this shabby packaging of one of his PBS shows is irritating. The only real work that has been done has the been the 5.1 audio mix--the rest is just lifted from the broadcast; with interviews conducted over the solos and instrumental sections to mask sloppy edits to fit more songs into the one hour program. Undoubtedly, the unedited concert exists in one form or another. I would have sacrificed the surround sound mix for an unedited 'Mandolin Rain', or hear the soprano sax solo unmarred in 'End of the Innocence'. Almost a waste of time and money. Almost."
4,One of the Best Hornsby DVDs,"This DVD featured some very talented people playing along side Bruce. That talent includes Don Henley on ""End of the Innoncence"", Bonnie Raitt on ""Rainbows Cadillac, Bob Weir playing guitar and lead vocals on his own Grateful Dead hit ""Jack Straw"", Gregory Hines (actually tap dancing on Long Tall Cool One),and Pat Matheny playing guitar on ""White-Wheeled Limousine."" Overall, the concert was excellent, the only problem was that only part of the concert is actually on the DVD, they should have released the entire concert."
5,A must watch DVD.... Bruce Hornsby & Friends...,"This is a must watch DVD in my book. This is Bruce at his best, live. I have watched this DVD at least 3 or 4 times since I bought it. I can never sick of watching it. The songs are wonderful and so is his playing. So buy this CD and have hours of enjoyment. Thanks."
1,don't waste your time,"The cover for this grill is a piece of useless garbage. WARNING: DO NOT BUY IT! I bought the patio caddie grill and cover this past august, and in just a matter of months the wind and ripped this cheap, ineffective grill cover to shreds. The grill itself is great, it works as advertised, but do not throw your money away on this horrible cover that they try to sell with it."
4,"Good grill cover, but be careful you don't rip it!","Perfect cover for the Patio Caddie grill. Just be careful that you don't rip it. The bottom of the cover has elastic so it stays snug on the grill, but when taking off the cover this makes it get caught on the grill or knobs easily. The material is quite thin, but I should have been more careful when taking it off, and mine ripped in the first week I had it. Now I know..."
3,Patio Caddie Cover 4186140,"Don't particularly like the color. The picture looks greenbut when I received it the color is black, plus it is thinfabric."
3,Should be heavier material...,"This item is advertised as ""heavy duty vinyl"". It is definitely not heavy duty vinyl in my opinion but it does the job of covering the Caddie grill. We'll see how it survives an upstate NY winter!"
1,grill cover way too big,I was very disappointed - I ordered this for the Indoor/Outdoor George Foreman grill that it was pictured with - it hangs on the floor of the deck. I want to return. Why is this pictured with this particular grill.
2,Char Broil Caddie Cover a bit flimsy,The Char broil caddie cover that I purchased fits fine over the BBQ. But the plastic is fairly thin and when left in the sun stretches. Suggest that you leave the BBQ in the shade if you use this cover.
2,Too big for the job,"I bought this cover specifically in conjunction with my George Foreman outdoor grill. Turns out it is way too big for the grill and slips off over the grill cover, probably due to a combination of it's weight and the wind."
2,too big and too long,"It is OK, but too big too long for George Foreman GGR200RDDS, if you can put grill in garage, no need to buy this, it is OK to have it for your grill on deck."
1,You would be better off with a trash bag,"I received this free as part of a promotion; if had cost me anything, I'd be returning it. Even the bag in which the cover is packaged is made of a much heavier gauge plastic.I suppose it would be an adequate dust cover if you were storing the barbeque in your garage or a shed for the winter. I'll be surprised if it makes until the end of summer in a daily environment of hours of direct sunlight and salt air . I expect I'll be covering my Patio Caddie with a large heavy-duty drawstring trash bag this winter."
1,One star is better than it deserves....,"I had to replace my Gas-Weber Grill (sigh) with a pedestal model because I relocated and have only an itty-bitty porch on which to place a BBQ.. The grill itself ain't a Weber by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm learning how to use it. The cover, by contrast, is a piece of junk. Portland in the winter can become windy, and I've placed the 'feet' of the grill over the cover to hold it down, so that solved any airborne problems with this cheap, flimsy thing. But it's less than a year old and torn in a number of places.. I swear Saran Wrap would be a better substitute if one had the patience to apply it. A rubber-bonded tarp is what I'm looking for now.. I'll tie the darn thing down. At $14, it's still a royal RIP."
1,Other reviewers are NOT LYING!!!!,"After only one year, I woke up this morning to find the grill cover ripped and blowing in the wind. I went to pick it up and the material started cracking and breaking into smaller pieces.I'd pay about $5... but no more than that. As other reviewers said...not much better than a garbage bag (which is what I am currently using."
1,Waste of Money,"I recently purchased this cover. At first it served well but within the week, it began to rip. This morning I found it in pieses across my patio. It became brittle and fragile within only a week. My grill is now uncovered and the cover is in the garbage where it belongs. A paper bag would work better and be a lot cheaper. I feel cheated."
1,Flimsy,"Cover doesn't completely cover the grill. Worse, it is so flimsy, it has already torn. A good grill deserves a better cover."
1,poor quality,This grill cover barely reached the bottom of the grill and the elastic that was supposed to keep it on kept popping off. It only lasted one season; it had a large vertical rip almost as long as the cover itself when I looked it over this Spring. I threw it away.
1,Isn't Worth A Dime,"This grill cover isn't worth a dime! After reading all the awful reviews of this item, I went against all odds and purchased the darn thing. What a waste of money! I live in a condo and have a private balcony. During the first week of use, this cover blew off several times. I tried to back the grill up into a corner to prevent the cover from blowing off and it ripped where the plastic kept coming into contact with the brick wall. What a rip-off! (No pun intended.)"
1,Overpriced p.o.s.,"Don't waste your money on this item !Instead, buy a box of quality disposablegarbage bags... better bang for the buck !"
2,Questionable Cover,The coveer and shipping cost about $17 WHICH I THINK IS TOO MUCH FOR LOOSE FITTING COVEER.
4,nice cover,We are using this for a George Foreman grill and it fits nicely. I don't yet know how well it will wear.
1,Waste of money,"I bought one of these for the second patio caddie I have had. The first patio caddie was better by far and the cover was heavy duty vinyl and was lined with velcro fasteners at the bottom. This cover is thin vinyl, not lined and the elastic band around the bottom makes it hard to take the cover on and off. After one season it developed holes in the vinyl which would enlarge when the wind blew against the cover and grill. It is not worth any money to buy this poorly made substitute for the real thing which apparently is no longer made. Too bad."
3,"Adequate cover for the price, but deluxe it's not","This is the ONLY cover that seems to be made for the Charbroil Patio Caddy grills.It is adequate for the price if you buy it for less than $10, but deluxe it's not.The thickness of the material is very thin. I bought one a couple of years ago, but an over zealous yard man got too close with a weed wacker and destroyed it.Be careful, it tears easily."
3,"good fit, but not very durable","This cover fits the Char-Broil Patio very well, but it's pretty flimsy. I figured it was a little stronger, but within a week I had a couple of tears in the cover. I could have avoided this had I known up front that it was easily ripped. Buyers who know this in advance should be fine -- just be careful when putting the cover on and pulling it off...don't let it catch."
2,very low quality,I am tempted to replace it with a heavy duty trash bag. The only reason I gave it two stars is it lasted about 12 months.
1,NO!,I bought this for our George Foreman outdoor grill. It tore after the first use and continued to tear with every other use. Waste of money. A garbage bag has held up better over the grill then this.
1,Poor quality flimsy,Don't waste your money it is so flimsy and thin that it rips apart and cannot take strong sun exposure very poor quality char broil you guys should be ashamed of yourself
2,Disappointed that Char Broil put out a bad product,I was hopping some of the negative reviews were just unhappy people. Sadly this cover does not perform well nor holds up well :-(It tears without one realizing it.. I did buy two for this reason..won't buy another though.
4,Perfect fit.,Works great. So happy I found a used gas patio caddie for sale locally. I'm happy with this product. I keep it under my deck so no wind gets at it. This cover keeps dust and pollen off it which is awful where I live.
3,Does the Job :-),"I purchased this cover in January, 2007. So far no problems. This cover is on the thin side but it is much heavier than the standard heavy duty trash bag and I dont think it would tear unless you are extremely rough with it. The bottom line is that, it was made to fit the grill and it does and though i would like it to made of heavier material for the money, it does its job with no problems so far."
1,Gone With the Wind!,"I've bought three covers.(Is this a definition of insanity?) As other reviewers have said, my covers have mysteriously disappeared from my 8th floor condo balcony during the night in lovely Long Beach,California. No Nor'easters here! Don't waste your time or money!"
3,Does the job,"I use this grill for the winter time. I have it by the sliding door in the back of the house for easy access during the cold winters in Chicago. It does the job for this time of the year. However it could be better. I know there are hot spots, but the burner in one side burns too much, so you have to keep moving the food around, so it doen't burn the meat. This is my second one grill for this purpose. It is great for samll apartments or for the winter as I use it."
1,Who approved this item for sale under Char-Broil name,Received everything on time and in good shapefrom Amazon.Char-Broil Patio Caddie Grill Cover looked somewhat flimsy. After 1 month it is getting a little shabby and has a tear. I looked the grill over and could not find any sharp projections which could tear the cover. Not exposed to sun and has been removed and replaced 5 or so times when the grill is cool.Don't feel it will last more than another month or so.
3,Works but still not so great.,"I've had this cover prior to this and surprisingly it lasted about 4-5 though years before it started to split crack and basically become useless. I did have this BBQ on the north side of my house though so perhaps that extended the life a bit. It will do the job but it is pretty thin plastic. It basically reminds me of a plastic baby pant material, it's even got the elastic around the bottom. Like others have said a large garbage bag would probably be just as good. Too bad they don't make a thicker fitted cover for this thing."
1,Poor quality product,This cover is poorly sewn and made from material that is too light. It will not withstand the weather for very long.
1,Not like the first one we owned,"I've owned the Patio Caddy Grill for 7 years. The cover I purchased 7 years ago finally needed to be replaced this winter. My old cover was heavy weight and fit the grill perfectly and NEVER blew off. I did read some poor reviews about this cover but purchased it anyway, figuring it was worth a shot since it was the only one I could find. I purchased this cover on 01/25/09 and it suffered it's first rip about two weeks ago. Now it is ripped in so many places that if I don't throw it out soon my neighbors will have pieces of it in their yards. It is extremely thin and brittle. It is too big at the top and too short on the length. It has been cold here in NY the last few weeks, but like I said, the last cover lasted for 7 years- outside each winter in the same climate. Back to searching for a better option."
4,Pleased,I ordered this product to use over a George Foreman indoor/outdoor grill. At one time I had a Charbroil Pattie grill and it came with this type of cover. We are very pleased with the quality of this cover. Fits over the grill very well with lots of room. I would definitely recommend this product.
