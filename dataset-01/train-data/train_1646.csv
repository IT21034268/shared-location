3,awkard...,"I bought Rosetta Stone portuguese 1&2.Apart from the learning experience which i rate satisfactory i must point out the awkard loading of the disc.You need a cd called application before you can load the first cd.When the time came to load the 2nd cd of my course the software went berserk.To make a long story short you need to insert the cd application AGAINREMOVE,ERASE FOR GOOD the first learning cd.Thereafter you insert the cd application again so you thankfully can load the 2nd learning cd.No answer from support for 2 days so i took matters in my own hands and i fixed ...what? Now i have the 2nd learning part of my course but i had to erase all my previous sessions! What if i need to go back and review some?Very stupid company move,there must be a better way to protect your income than this,unnecessarily frustrating your customers."
2,Buggy,"Love the format, but this is the buggiest piece of software I've ever encountered on my Mac. It constantly crashes, tells me there is ""minor error"" in which case you have to repeat whatever little section your are on.Very very poor programming."
2,Quality problems,The CD player stopped working about a week after I got the product....Didn't even bother returning it - instructions were discouraging. Overall - for the price - the quality is not very good.
2,Really not worth the $$$,"I bought this and at first it seemed good enough. It's kind of big and bulky, but it had a cd player and an external antenna which I wanted because radio reception isn't too good in my bathroom. This thing takes 6 ""C"" batteries which is a substantial investment right there. The first set of batteries died rather quickly. The second set didn't last much longer. Never made it through a 3rd set because the cd player stopped working. I definately wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a shower cd player. I had bought another cheapie brand before this one and that died quickly as well. My advice is to spend the money on a good one like the Sony that gets good reviews if you can afford it. If you can't afford it, get a discman that runs on 2 AA batteries and a pair of little speakers and set that up outside the shower instead. It'll probably be cheaper and it'll definately last longer."
2,Not the best Dr book I have read,"This dr who book took me a long time to read. I found it hard to read because it just was not that good. The mercenaries in the book were revolting to read about. A lot of graphic death was portrayed here. I like to read dr Who for sci fi romp, not a horror novel. I understand that characters die in these books, but does it have to be so graphic?...The overall story was kinda Ok, but still stretched it a lot. I understand that war is not pretty, and the things that men do to others in war is not as well, but give me a story that shows individuals trying to rise above that is what I ask. Even in war, man can rise above the baseless violence at times. maybe that is just me.....The book just was violent and hard to read for me. Other books, such as the tv episodes redone to print are much better stories to read. they have better character development and plot. Find those books."
5,A REAL Musician,"This is one of the best productions you will have the pleasure of listening to. Jaigh is an accomplished guitar player, songwriter, engineer and producer. He will make you think with his words, make you dance with his music.Buy this CD. It will be more than worth it...."
4,Great Investing Advice,The Armchair Millionaire gives everyone the advice and support they need to succed in investing. The book shows you the simple things that everyone can do no matter how small their paycheck is to eventually become a millionaire and retire early. There is great advice on what to invest in safely and how to get the most out of your money by avoiding some taxes. Everyone who wants to become a millionaire needs to read this book.
3,Beginners only,"I agree with the previous comments of there being nothing new introduced in this book. However, if this is going to be your first book ever on investing, it does offer good advice for the novice investor. Just DO NOT use the strategy they propose to making a million through index funds. Last i checked on their website, since it's inception in 1998, their portfolio has gone down 25.36% for a total loss of abut 31,000$.Man, if i were them, i'd take down the site. It must pretty embarrassing to write a whole book about it being so easy to make a million through their ""proven methods"", and lose all that money trying to really prove it."
5,armchair $$$,"I am in the business and this is right on!Easy read. The plan works, Work the plan.Remember freedom is a marathon not a sprint..."
2,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm sorry to report that the book was a major disappointment. It is way over simplified. Although it is written in clear, understandable language, it has no depth. Most readers can get the same information from browsing the Internet.The draw is the title. Everyone wants to be a ""millionaire"" of course. I hate to give away the whole plot, but Schiff and Gerlach advise you to save and invest and let time work its magic through compound interest. Some other suggestions include taking advantage of tax deferred accounts, hold down transaction costs, and 'stay the course'.I expected more and was very disappointed."
4,Great Game!,"This game is a blast! I like it as much as my kids. I haven't played many other games like it so I don't have a lot to compare to. I also like the fact that it does not have indecent exposure of females/males or that foul language is not used. Some of the crashes are a little extreme, no way the human body could take that much punishment! I guess that is why it is a video game!!!"
3,You can do interesting stunts. Get bored quickly.,"PROS:- You can do interesting stunts like double flips, etc.CONS:- Graphic does not look realistic. Rider graphic: 7 over 10. Environtment graphic: 5 over 10.- Crashing into objects does not created realistic results.I.E: I crashed into the trailer but nothing happened. I was able to continue riding. After I crashed into a tree, I flew off the bike and fell into the ground but the tree was not damaged at all.- After a short time, you get bored quickly because all the racing modes play the same."
2,what happened THQ?,"what can i say? but that i am extremelly disappointed in this game. THQ had a winner with Ricky Carmichael MX 2002 so i figured this version could only be better. boy, was i wrong!!how could they screw this up?? start with constantly having to reposition the view of the track from the rider perspective and being distracted from the real fun of this game riding and racing!!!Wake up THQ and pull your head out of your ass and go back and look at Ricky Carmichael 2002 and try again. oh and one other thing fix the suspension preload instead of the joystick make it a button like the previous version."
2,Not too good.,"OK, if this was the only combat flight simulation I had ever seen I would think it was pretty cool. For a Jane's flight sim circa 2002 however, it's not too good. The sound, graphics, and gameplay are not only not up to the standards of recent combat flight sims such as IL2 Sturmovik, they are not even up to the standards of prior Jane's flight sims such as WWII Fighters. If you don't have that sim, or Microsoft CFS2, or Sturmovik, or even European Air War,.."
1,"Dude, you're gettin ripped...",if you buy this game. ok.. I have got to say that for something from Janes.. it's beyond aweful... don't waste your money
3,JAS,"It`s not bad, not great ethier.It could use better joy stick control..I have use my keyboard to increase thrust which is a distraction whenin hard dogfighting.Graphics are just okay but could be better.aiming is a real pain in this game too.Overall I find it fun, I like running the AI pilotin the ground when I can`t shake him..good trick usewhen he is on your six, fly as low to ground as you canand watch him buy it...be careful you don`t join him.A steep dive frustrates AIs too..zoom climb and you canget him also."
1,WORST JANES GAME EVER,WHEN YOU FIRE THE GUNS YOU GET SOME KIND SHADOW AND CAN NOT SEE WHAT YOUR FIREING AND THE VIEWS [ARE BAD] TOO. NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST GAME JANES PUT OUT WW2 FIGHTERS THATS A DAM GOOD GAME BUT THIS ONE IS SO BAD THAT IM BRING IT BACK TO THE STORE. IM SO OVER BUYING THIS CRAP!!!!!! LIVE AND LEARN
1,Palm Leather Belt Clip,"The metal clip broke off just after 30 days, then I slid my belt through the slot, and this worked for about another 30 days and tore above the seam. Nice idea to keep the Palm on your belt, but this design is not durable"
3,Bitter over Buckle,"This item was nice while it was new, but over time my belt buckle finally met its doom. The metal buckle separted away from the carrier . I guess I could find a seamstress."
3,"It's what they say, But....","Well fitting is the downfall, otherwise it's a good accessory. What I mean is, it's hard to get the Palm out because the fit is too good. You have to tug at it with two fingers, and the Palm is inherently slippery. Not enough peeks up above the lip of the pouch to get a grab on it, even though there is a small half moon cutout to get help your fingers grab. These cutouts should be bigger. If the Velcro flap faced outward, it would make access faster too, and would not adhere to clothing.The other problem is that a little bump and it turns on the Palm even when it's in the pouch because there is no protection from the instant on buttons."
4,Coasters don't quite sit in bottom of this,"I bought this and coasters as a gift. (Originally I thought it came as pictured with the coasters, but it does not.) I bought separte coasters from same company. They don't quite sit flush against the bottom, but mom loved it anyway. She said they're much nicer than the ones she has"
2,Check the SIZE of your coasters first!,"I actually love this holder. It's very well made and beautiful. One problem. One BIG problem. My thirstycoasters don't fit!! I just purchased the ""Fence in the Mist"" Thirstycoasters and they are 4.5 inches in diameter. This holder will hold coasters that are 4 inches in diameter. Now I have to find new coasters for this holder and a new holder for my new coasters! Ugh!!"
4,They work and look good but coasters NOT included,"If you have their coasters, and want to keep them neatly in one place, this will do the job at a reasonable price. It's fairly attractive too. I was foolish enough to think the coasters were included It looks that way in the photo. Believe me, they are not!"
3,Ok coaster holder,"Nothing special....just holds coasters (I thought it came with the coasters but, apparently I didn't read the whole thing)"
2,Errors--can this book be trusted?,"This book was strongly recommended to me in my search for something accessible regarding quantum physics. However, like others reviewing this book, I'm bothered by the factual errors in the first few chapters regarding elementary facts about telescopes, microscopes and lenses. The President of the American Physical Society's insistence in the factual accuracy of the book and the author's similar insistence in her foreword make them all the more irritating. Even the Penguin editor should have caught these boners. How can I feel confident when she gets to a discussion of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics?"
3,Might be OK - hard to tell,Received the unit and it almost immediately had video problems. Installation went well and the product looks good. But the screen would blank out after a few hrs of being on and the audio would continue to work.Sent back to seller who promptly sent a new unit. So far so good.
2,TV is not digital,"I bought this TV about 3 years ago is its worked flawlessly. However, I just read in the tech specs that the tuner is an NTSC tuner which means its an analog TV - and wont work when the cable systems go digital on Feb 17 - unless you have a converter. Just an FYI - good luck!Ken"
2,Unit failed at 4 months,"I like the picture and size of the unit. The sound is a little tinny. Biggest problem is short warranty period. My unit failed after 4 months of occassional use and Audiovox said ""too bad it is out of warranty."" Maybe they know there is a problem and do not or cannot fix. 90 days for a $400 TV is way too short."
1,Huge disappointment,"I have had nothing but issues with this product. The screen displays is washed out and the adjustment controls are too limited to fix this. The DVD player constantly skips. The radio antenna is a waste of time. It doesn't pick up anything but the strongest signals and even then with some static. I was leary of an Audiovox product, but wanted the larger screen. My opinion is to forget the extra inch and get the Sony."
1,Do not buy from Audiovox,This TV broke in the first two weeks I owned it. Both the picture and audio would not work. I brought it to a local repair shop that could not fix it - I called the company and was just outside of their 90 day warranty and they did nothing for me.I would never buy from them again.
3,Won't show color,"I got the 10.4"" (which is discontinued)as a present for my Dad and it was impressive right out of the box. However the picture wouldn't display with color after the unit was warmed up (DVD picture was fine - just problems with the TV picture). I had the cable company check the signal just in case but the problem was in the set. Also the clock wouldn't set right. I've reordered the 10.2"" so I'll try again."
3,New Stories,"Though this is not one of Beattie's best works, I enjoyed reading Perfect Recall. Many of the stories have delicious endings and moments of clarity for the characters which make the stories worth reading. As always, Beattie has a fine eye for how we humans operate and captures the complexity and quirkyness of life in each of her characters. Because most of her stories take place in either Key West or Maine and involve cooking, I felt they ended up running together in my mind, and I had a hard time viewing them as fresh and new"
3,Nice case really doesn't fit my camera,"The case is very nice, good quality. It is just slightly too small for my camera Nikon S60."
5,5-Tier Organizer - Dog,We had this for over a year and its in perfect condition. It holds my sons stuffed animals and can handle a lot of weight. I'd recommend getting all of the animal organizers.
1,over my head,"It's virtually impossible to describe what this book is, but since there's no other Amazon reviews as of my writing, I'll give it a shot.It's meant to be a humorous almanac of the kinds of things a well-bred Yalie or Princetonian would need to know. There are sections on laudanum, tae kwon do, fathering a child, transgressive education, and seasonal vegetable sculpting. There are many illustrations, all black-and-white.The thing is completely over my head. It appears to be a book you're meant to take into the john and read a few paragraphs at a time. But it never made me laugh and I have no idea who it was written for.But, like I said, hard to categorize. I advise you simply go to a bookstore and physically thumb through a copy before purchasing."
4,Good book--could be better,Pretty good book for someone starting out. He does add alot of personal life not related to flipping and repeats over and over how he is a host on Extra. Would be better if before and after pictures were from the same angle.
4,Good book to train investors how to visualize potential in properties,If you are new to flipping houses this is an excellent resource. Mr. Corbett's book walks you through the money making elements essential to a successful flip.
4,Highly recommended,Very good book. If any one is interested in fliping homes this book is worth it's pricetag.
5,best book on flipping,"you dont need to spent 1000's on seminars and boot camps,this inexpensive book will help you tremebdously in RE investing. I am a RE investor, have done a little flipping and want to do more, I own more than a 100 books on re investing(I have more than the library) This is the best book out of all of them,jammed packed with info just for a couple of dollars.Forget about Carleton Sheets, just buy this book.Its a great book over 300 pages of timely info on flipping. His photo is on the cover, a very handsome bloke to boot!"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this book thinking that I might learn something after I read the glowing reviews by others. Believe me, don't waste your money. There is nothing here.I have purchased and own several properties so I am not exactly a novice investor, but am always looking for new ideas and techniques. There are no techniques, advice or even a motivational factor in this book that would make it worth the sales price. Two thumbs down!"
3,"Not the best, but not the worst either.","This was the third book I read on the subject of flipping real estate and while it wasn't worst book I've read, much of the information seemed to be a repeat of what the others covered. There still is plenty of information contained within that other authors never mention, so this is still worth reading if you're exploring the topic.I started with Kirsten Kemp'sFlipping Confidentialwhich I found to be a well organized primer on flipping. If you've never read any books on the subject, start with that book first.If you want a true, step-by-step manual, try Rick Villani'sFLIP: How to Find, Fix, and Sell Houses for Profit. After reading that book, I felt like I had a clear program to follow and had I had the cash, I would have been ready to start flipping."
2,"Find It, Fix It, Flip!: Make Millions in Real Estate",I did not order this book. It was charged and shipped to me. I was not given the option of canceling or deleting it as one normally is.
2,Be careful,"I am frightened of anyone who says to avoid buying from FSBOs (for sale by owners props) because that is where you can make the best deals. Think about it, realtors ask for 6% and provide comps in the area. It is to their best advanatge to heighten the selling price to the max. The real deals are found by contacting sellers before they find agents.Also, he writes ""use your home as a means to generate profit""..and ""one house at a time."" This is not true ""investing."" Buying your primary home and upgrading it is not true investing. There are different loans and different tax complications when buying a second property. It's a whole other issue when it is not your primary residence. Beware."
2,Notice anything strange about the glowing reviews?,"Most are brief, breathless raves that scream ""a realtor wrote this!!!"" As with most titles of this genre, the authors get by with a little help from their friends. Highly recommend perusing the book at your local library or bookstore before you buy."
5,This is the one!,"I bought a house with the plan of flipping it and making lots of money. However, I soon realized I didn't know what I was doing. A friend suggested that I read ""Find It, Fix It, Flip It!"", and boy am I glad I did. It showed me step by step what to do and was tremendously helpful. I couldn't have done it without this book!"
2,It was o.k.,"It was O.K. but not great. I didn't really notice any change in my skin, but as a moisturizer it works fine."
1,The switch does not work,I have been a fan of Irene's since the first book in this series. I gave this latest offering of Jan Burke's several tries and couldn't get past the second chapter. Perhaps if the opening chapters were written from Frank's perspective....but they're not. I sincerely hope that the next Irene Kelly book will prominently feature one of the Kelly's.
5,Good addition to the series.,"I have enjoyed quite a few of the Irene Kelly novels and this one was no exception...although it is not really Irene but her husband Frank Harriman that takes the spotlight.Most writers have difficulty chnaging the main characters and have the previous ones only in cameo appearances. Not so Mrs Burke.From the first page the novel takes off in a long prologue which could have been a story in itself. Ten years later, Harriman is picking up the pieces of a trail which is still as hot and contentious as it was 10 years ago.Deft writing and excellent plotting keep us glued to the pages of the story.I am looking forward to read more of Mr ( and I guess Mrs) Harrimans adventures.Harriman"
3,Mixed Bag Need to suppliment,"This book is a mixed bag. It can't decide whether it is a history book, a guide book, a touring book, or a floater's book. It is interesting, and I am glad I got it, but it doesn't serve the purpose that I was looking for of providing good information on river travel. Lots of information on river history and early travelers, but if you were looking for a river guide you are going to have to suppliment"
5,Creepiest book that actually gave me chills!,"I must say this is the best book I have read in months! I was surprized throughout the novel, and for me, that's rare. As an avid horror reader, it's pretty hard to find a book that will either scare or suprize me.I sat down in the store and read the first chapter and was hooked. This book is clever and very spooky. I don't scare easily, but it took a while for me to fall alseep after reading this!The characters are wonderfully written, and the plot is really engaging. However, I think the best part of this book is how visual everything is, and also how James Herbert doesn't stop-the picture doesn't fade to black when the crepy monster is leaning over the fainting lady, we get to see what happens behind that black curtain most authors draw.Overall, I was greatly impressed and highly reccomend this book to any horror lover, or someone who just wants a really good novel to read!"
5,Fast-paced and unique,"While a bit shocking at times, Others is never boring. The story line and pacing kept me turning pages to find out who these beings were that haunted the protagonist, Dismas. Also, I must point out that Herbert did an EXCELLENT job of portraying the thoughts and physical/emotional pain of a severely disabled man. The protagonist in Others is very unique and thought-provoking. I thought that the ending to Others was totally fitting and although it was bittersweet, I don't think the book would have worked if Herbert had ended it any other way."
2,Not Herbert's Best Book--Terrible Conclusion,"Is this the same James Herbert that wrote The Fog and The Rats? It seems he's lost some of his touch here. Others is a very slow-moving and often dreary book, which builds to a fairly memorable climax, then ends with what is possibly the worst three-page conclusion I've ever read. This is not the same guy who kept me turning the pages with the aforementioned books, as well as Domain, Lair, and The Spear. I had to force myself to finish the book, and that is never a good sign."
4,Reasonable,Not one of his best booksI have read better but still worth a read if you like the author
3,Keeps you wondering,"This is one of those books that teases you and just gives bits and pieces as you go along to make you wonder and speculate what the secret is behind all the psychotic things that are happening to the main character, Dismas. It's quite bizarre and unrealistic but yet I went along without always going, 'yeah right'. It kept me engaged and definately draws on your imagination. I wouldn't say it was great but it was well written with lots of graphic details."
5,Scary but makes you think,"A man reborn as a deformed PI. A mansion full of mutant children. A pretty but deformed nurse being prepared for a snuff movie. WOW! But all is not blood and gore in 'Others'. In fact, Herbert treats the deformed unfortunates with a deal of sympathy and compassion - it is the 'normal' folk who are the antagonists. This is the ultimate 'thinking person's' book.Nick Dismas, the unfortunate protagonist was born with deformities for a reason. His characterization is excellent - bad habits, bad attitude and all. As usual, Herbert writes smoothly and effortlessly, producing a novel that will grip you right from the off and won't put you down until the final chapter."
4,Another great book from the true master of horror!,"This novel is a must for all Herbert fans, specialy to the horror novels fans!Though not is best book, the tension runs in an overwelming crescendo as you devour it's pages.Read it!"
3,"Good, could have been great!","A couple of scary moments involving Nick Dismas, the hero of the story. But I kept waiting for a big payoff regarding Dismas's ""past life""...it never really happened. All in all, Dismas is a very interesting character, especially knowing all of his disabilities and all he's gone through. The book is a good, quick read and I'd recommend it...but I kept waiting for more!!"
4,A british PERSPECTIVE.,"Though not his best work, this book is head and shoulders above the rest. The horror is found in the fact that a severly disabled man has to struggle to be accepted as an equal in a job he is as good at anyone else at. James Herbert, it has to be remembered, does subtle. Something Americans should try and bare in mind"
4,creeped me out but got me thinking,"When I finished this book I was as they say, totally creeped. I was expecting something along the lines of Haunted or Ghosts of Sleath (both 5-star books, by the way) but Others was very different. I was more caught up in the morality of it all than with the clairvoyance or more ""spooky"" aspects. At the end of the book where the author says this book was somewhat based on true events he'd heard about from someone else, I did a double take thinking that his statement couldn't possibly be true. Or could it? That part scared me the most, to be honest. I would recommend this book to anyone but I wouldn't let my 13 year old read it because of the incredibly disturbing images. It is one of those books that, aside from the fictional aspects, really leads a person to think."
2,Want To Put Obscene Monstrous Pictures Into Your Mind?,"I gave this novel two stars because the author writes beautifully and there is no doubt he is a writer of talent and power. Unfortunately he uses his gift to tell a story of monsterously deformed human beings who are treated with cruelty. Why any reader would want to put such images into his/her mind (which is the equivalent of eating sewage) is anyone's guess. I did not know what I was getting into when I bought this book and I sure wish I had not read it. Is it a ""horror novel?"" Yes, but not the kind of story or descriptions that you would ever want to read. How terribly sad that an author with such possibility chose to depict monsters rather than to show us beauty. I will never read another James Herbert novel."
2,No brainer!,"Like the previous reviewer, I have not yet gotten around to reading the copy of ""Others"" I got for Christmas. UNLIKE, him however, I would never presume to send in a review for something I HADN'T read. How stupid!"
1,I remember? WHAT!,"If your a soul who is in hell, and you've been sent back to redeem yourself, and if you are to be stipped of all that you knew, how in the HELL can you wrtite the book in the 1st person format! ""My life began in hell"". How dumb is that? Should have been 3rd person ""His life began in hell"" would been more engrossing, more enjoyable. But then Jim's work has always been in that format. Didn't he think as a ""rat"" in that book he wrote RATS? Hmmmm. STAY AWAY!"
1,Hmmm . . .,"I have not read this book, but from the synopsis given, it is sounds strangely familiar to William Hjortsberg's novel Falling Angel. Something to think about."
5,"I *LOVE* this knife, but watch your fingers","I purchased this knife several months ago, and it continues to be my favorite knife. In fact, I use it more frequently now than my chef's knife because of the flatter bottom, thinness, and lighter weight. I was afraid that I might be buying a ""specialty"" knife that wouldn't get much action, and I ended up with the opposite.PROS:- shape, light weight, and thinness are perfect for chopping/slicing almost anything- Wusthof brandPRO-CON:- It is super, crazy sharp. The first time I wiped the side of it down with my kitchen sponge, it sliced through the sponge effortlessly. I was thankful for the lesson, as I've been extremely mindful of that while using it.CONS:- None that I can findThe smaller knife is a great bonus, though I can't say that I use it any differently than my other paring knife."
3,The missing System Requirements,"Please disregard the stars rating, I haven't played the game.Here's the System Requirements:Mac OSX 10.2.5800 MHZ PowerPC G4 or better256 MB RAM32 MB Radeon 7500 / GeForce 2 class 3D hardware acceleration required64 MB Radeon 9000 / GeForce 4 Titanium or better recommended2 GB free on Hard Disk"
1,Don't purchase if you have a macbook pro,"I bought this game thinking how great it would be to have one of my childhood favorites on my new macbook pro. Unfortunately it does not work on a Macbook Pro, even when it is the version for Macs. I searched the internet for a solution and could not find one. Do not waste your money if you have a Macbook pro. I don't know if it works on a standard Macbook or not."
1,Check which Mac OS you have!!!,"Bought this game for my sister's birthday. She has the latest Mac laptop (as of June '09). When she inserted the game it wouldn't work on the OS she has. Apparently, it doesn't specify which OS it works on either.Otherwise, I'm sure it would be a good game from what she's heard/told me about.Just make sure which OS you have before buying."
1,Bad reveiw,"This game is very hard to control. It does not allow you to save, so you end up having to redo the whole segment over and over till you make it."
1,Poor quality,"First table had a large split down the center. Didn't even unwrap the rest of the table. Ordered a replacement, which came with part of the table top glued off center, so that unfinished wood was showing around the edges. Top was also slightly warped, and had a knot hole with a crack in it that looked like it might expand over time. Liked the style of the table, but there were too many flaws, even for the, even for the relatively inexpensive price. On the plus side, both deliveries came two days after I ordered them!"
3,Was what I expected,"After reading ther other reviews for this table I thought I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. I was neither dissappointed or surprised. The table is assembled quite easily, I did have to wrap some of the packaging tape around the dowels on the legs to make them snug in the holes on the lower shelf. The assembled table looks exactly like the picture. The fit and finish of the lower shelf is not good but also not noticable for the application I have ( divider between two recliners ). The finish on the top was in good condition w/ no scratches . I wish I knew more about what to expect from all the different finishes, this antique walnut looks more ""cherry""to me..."
3,Winsome Wood End Table,"This is an assembly project and it was very disappointing when one of the screw inserts in one of the legs was missing and I had to ""MacGyver"" it to keep the endtable stable. The Color is not what it looks like on-line. It has more of a red tint to it."
5,end tables winsome,"I needed tall end tables, and I got exactly what I wanted, they fitted with my sofa perfectly and was easy assembly"
4,OK for the money,"I bought one of these a couple years ago from a brick & mortar store and wanted one for the other side of my couch. Although it's the same design and (I believe) manufacturer, this one is a little lighter in color than my original one.I did have an issue with one leg nut screwing in the bolt. It was very tight even trying to screw it directly in the leg without going through the table.I have a mat I put on top to protect it from scratches and scuffs, but the finish seems solid enough for general use."
5,Coasters galore!,"I bought these to adorn my living room of globes, and I have to say that I was more than pleased with the coasters. They are very heavy, made of sand...the detail is exquisite and ornamental. Shipping was very fast as well, item packaged in excellent condition. The price is well worth it; I would definately recommend this product and seller!"
5,Pretty & functional coasters,"I like these coasters. I had a set from 10+ yrs ago & must have dropped & broken all but 1, so it was time to get a new set. I love the sandstone, it absorbs all the moisture from my cold drinks & never sticks to my glass like non-porous coasters often do. They're also nice-looking, the design is pretty. I like the wide variety avail, next time I may go to the mfr's website to get more/different designs."
3,Okay coaster set,"The coasters work fine. The set looks just like the picture. The wooden holder was broken when it arrived but as I didn't plan to use it, that didn't bother me. The maps are not as clear as I would have liked but they will do. I am looking for more coasters but I don't think I will buy anymore of these."
2,"Poor print quality, different from image","I am very disappointed after I received the set and I am returning it. There were a few problems:1. The overall hue is different from the image shown. It's got a blue/green tint to it, which isn't the warm colors I was expecting from the image.2. The margin around the image is smaller than is shown. May not be a minus, but still, it shows that the sample image isn't accurate at all.3. The print quality is very poor. It's very blurry, can barely make out the world map -- maybe it's the problem in image selection, the amount of detail simply isn't fit for such a small coaster. And the worst part is the different inks used do not line up (it'd have a red outline next to a blue outline when the two lines should be perfectly overlapping, for example), so it has the cheap-newspaper look.I would not recommend this, for self or for gift."
2,Not as pretty as the picture,"I thought these would look nice with my decor but the map is very faded.Old World Passages, Sandstone Thirstystone Coaster Set"
5,New tables,"Brand new tables, and not only do these coasters add a touch of decor, but have also protected my tables for the last few months, so that they are still looking brand new. The name says it all...no water ever leaks off the coaster."
3,Good design,"These are great looking coasters. However, the color of stone varies from coaster to coaster and they are not very durable."
4,Beautiful,"I had a different coaster set that I bought at a Home Goods, but they kept sticking to the button of glasses until the inevitable happened and one broke. I ordered this set and I am pleased with the weight that keeps them from holding onto the glass and the overall quality of the coasters. The only reason I do not give five stars is that the printed map has a slight defect that gives it a tiny green spot on each one. However, I am pleased with the product. I ordered it on a Tuesday and received it that Thursday, so very pleased with this purchase."
3,"Old World Passages, Sandstone Thirsty Coaster Set","One of the coasters appears to have been chipped during shipping or packaging. A second coaster has a 1 inch long defect in the top surface-it appears to have been machined unevenly. I will return this set and order another to see if the replacement is defect free.Old World Passages, Sandstone Thirstystone Coaster Set"
1,guide doesn't apply to the game,"well....being as they changed the game, the guide no longer applies AT ALL...if you still want to buy one, email me and i'll sell you mine as i sure as heck don't need it anymore..."
1,Good investment if you dont mind wasting money,Until SOE can make up there mine on where Galaxies there is little or no point in buying any of the guides unless you dont mind wasting the money. Lets not forget that SOE is supposely coming out with another game later this year. Would be interesting to see how long it takes before that gets screwed up.
1,Useless Guide,The game has changed complety from when it was first released. None of the information in this book is of any use since its wrong.
1,Great Firestarter!!! A++,"Being the middle of Winter, many of us are huddling in our homes to protect ourselves from the cold. Some of us have problems getting the fireplace going.No more!Since the information in this book is completely outdated - and since no one with any self respect plays the trainwreck known as Star Wars Galaxies - this item is just what is required to keep your family warm in the winter.While you are at it - if you want to quit playing Star Wars Galaxies - you will get a higher return on your investment by using $15 to start the fire each month.Highly recommended over giving your money to Sony Online... Entertainment?"
1,SWG is dead,"CU killed SWG, and so everyone knows...it was absolutely and completely the fault of the nincompoops who ostensibly get paid a salary at SOE. they have the worst customer service in the world; they don't listen and they don't care, so ef them.RIP SWG dead 4/26/05"
5,Information is out-dated,"A recent MAJOR overhaul the entire Star Wars Galaxies ranking and gameplay systems has rendered this BOOK USELESS. Don't waste your money. The game is AWESOME, just the book is useless. I strongly encourage you to get the game and play, and once you start playing find experienced players to walk you through the tough stuff. But do yourself a favor and do not buy this until the cover says something like ""Includes new COMBAT UPGRADE"", unless you need something to start a fire with or a really thick coaster. Prima.... get your act together and get a new book out."
2,Adaptions to comic format just dont work!,"I should have known better than to buy this book, but I just could'nt help myself as I knew the artwork of Russell would be awsome. And it was!Unfortunitalythat was the only good thing about the book.Now dont get me wrong. I'm sure the original text based stories of Michael Moorcock are awesome. But unfortunitaly any complex translation from text to comic will virtually always leave something to be desired. This was the case with this book. To much story, which works well with text, just cant get crammed into a comic and retain the enjoyability."
1,This book is NO GOOD!,"Like I said in the title, this book is NO GOOD! It has no point and I think I got dumber as I read it. Goodbye!"
5,Timeless Classic,I remember loving this book as a 2nd grader and now my 2nd grade son is enjoying it too. Great author.
5,A very interesting kid friendly book,"Bought this book for my 3rd grade book report, he enjoyed reading it . Very good book, especially for book reports."
5,Ribsy by author Beverly Cleary,"I bought this book for my son to write a report on from Amazon, and WOW! They stated the condition of the book was good. I say it was great! Not a tear on any page or a crinkled cover. The pages were a little brown from normal aging; but other then that. Great condition. Thank you Amazon for your excellent time in the delivery and condition of the product.Sincerely,Mary from Florida"
1,Very Disappointed,I was really excited when the video arrived and immediately put it into the DVD player however even at full volume in both the TV and the cable box the video was inaudible. I returned the video for a replacement but the new video is almost inaudible as well. Some of the music can be heard but none of the dialog. I kept the video but I am disappointed because I'm a big Gilbert and Sullivan fan and I really wanted this operatta. The only alternative seems to be a trunkated version with Joel Grey as Point--I don't think so! I really wish Stratford Festival would do this operatta. They do such a wonderful job with Gilbert and Sullivan's works.
2,Not Great...,"The sound quality is very poor and the acting/singing variable (some very good, some really bad). It does include the whole score, which is a plus. However, I would not recommend this DVD."
1,"Bic razors ""SUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK""","By far the worst razors ever. I have been shaving for 14 years and have used cheap disposable, that work way better than bic. I had the 4 blade bics and when I came out of the bathroom, it looked like a got into a fight with sling blade. They chewed the crap out of my face; never before has this happened. Never use bic again!!"
1,Ouch!!! These things hurt on the FIRST Shave!!!,"Got nothing against Bic,stick to making pens and lighters!!! I bought these at CVS on sale,even at the cut rate price,these dont work that great for me,I do have a heaveier beard than most,but the Gillette Fusion always gives a great shave,even thick ones like mine,that's my favorite razor!!! Like I said these Bic Comfort 3 Advance razors hurt even on the first shave,Ouch!!!,sorry, dont wanna bleed,thank you!!! I'm gonna stick to my tried and true Gillette Fusion or possibly Schick Quatro!!! Not recommended!!!"
3,White Pudding,"Great White Pudding. I've had this in Scotland, but was unable to find it here in the US -- at least until I discovered that Amazon has a link to a great source of white pudding. I recommend trying it for the flavor of home."
1,Waaay Overpriced,"The CR2025 is $5 at a national electronics retailer, and $2.90 at a national drugstore, both much lower cost than the price that is listed here as of March 14, 2007."
3,No instructions...what instruments is it intended for?,"I purchased this for my protec concert-sized ukulele case. I could not attach it. As a seamstress who has built bags and backpacks, I do not believe that this strap can be attached to the case securely without altering either the case or the strap.It's a great strap, but it needs instructions and a detailed list of cases it's intended to be used on. If you have one of the other instruments mentioned in the other reviews, you should get it. It's well built and well padded.NOTE: The case I received is a newer model and no longer works with the pro-tec padded backpack strap. :-( I confirmed with the Pro-Tec people directly today. If your max uke case came with two shoulder straps, it doesn't have the loops for this product. According to the pro-tec people this is a recent change and you may want to contact them directly, if you have any questions about whether your case will work."
3,Rip...,"These straps are comfortable and nice, but there's a little rip starting to form from when I only wear it on one shoulder. Really this shouldn't happen. But just make sure you wear it on both shoulders and it'll be fine."
3,Could be better,"I've purchased two of these for a Pro Tech Bass trombone hard shell case.Pros: Works very nicely, easily adjustable to this case.Cons: The single clip attachment at the top needs improvement. It is difficult to carry the case without it swaying side to side. This causes wear eventually causing the strap material to wear out. For this heavy bass trombone case it only lasts about a year. I will probably order two this time so I have a spare when it wears out."
4,Much more carrying flexibility,"I was excited to find out that my Protec French horn case could be made into a backpack. Whenever I carry my horn, I always have other bags in tow, so the more hand access I have and the more balanced I am, the happier I am in the end. The backpack strap is still a recent addition to my case, so I can't speak for longevity. However, the padding does make it comfortable to carry, and the design does look like it should hold for a long time with my occasional travel.The one issue that brought the rating down from five stars is that the strap and/or the position of the loop holes on the French horn case don't allow me to carry the case as ergonomically as I would prefer. Could be more an issue with the case, but even after I tightened the straps, I still felt the case sagging a bit. This also might not be an issue with other instruments."
3,"Not bad, but needs some improvement","It makes my bass trombone case much easier to carry, but it has its flaws. The shoulder straps do not tighten enough to keep the case close to my back and in place. The shoulders could definitely use a little bit more padding. Not a pad product but it is a little uncomfortable to use.Definitely a recommended purchase, especially for a larger instrument."
5,Top Quality,I purchased this to go along with the Proteck Sax case - this strap is very substantial and definitely larger than normal straps for cases. It is padded for the added support needed for those times when the case can't be rolled. Again fast service and will remember this seller. Pricing cannot be beat!!!
2,much too difficult,"I bought the protect deluxe trumpet case along with this and could not figure out if it was even possible to attach! it claims to attach to any protec case but with no instructions provided, attaching this backpack stap proved an impossible task. not recommended."
2,Distracted by typos and random 'tick tocks'.,This book was ok but very much like others in the genre that I have read. It did not really stand out and I found the typos distracting.
4,Great Book!,"Dr. Schapiro does a great job of documenting her struggles with fertility and becoming a mother. It is not by any means a self help book or a guide because she had a lot of advantages of being on the ""inside"" most of us have to wrestle with our insurance companies and wait for weeks at a time to get some of the treatments she got overnight, but nonetheless it was an inspiring and uplifting book."
4,Excellent Introduction,"I bought both this book and the Moon Handbook of Nicaragua. I found the Footprint guide more simple and more to the point--easy to read in an evening to ""get your bearings"", and the maps are great. The Moon Handbook is more complete.I would recommend buying both these guidebooks--they are complimentary."
3,"Okay, but there's better out there","I went to Nicaragua with a friend, and I used this book, and he had the Moon travel guide. I must say that his book was much more in depth than this one. They both cover the same topics, the same history, the same locations, but the Moon book seemed to be more specific. This book seemed to have fewer hostels listed and didn't seem to have the depth that the Moon book did. If I had to do it over, I would've bought the other one."
2,Just a so-so book,"I agree with the one reviewer. This is just an okay book, but I returned it and bought another one instead. This one just didn't seem all that helpful to me. I decided I did not want a book written by a lawyer. Teachers know a lot more about special education and I have no intention of hiring a lawyer to fight my district. This book just seemed to be one large ad for lawyers and advocates who probably make a lot of money suing everybody."
3,Not bad,"I dunno, I don't think this is as bad as some people say, yet I don't find it as good as some other people say. It's a good book to get you started, but there is no way to totally understand special education with one book alone. Each book has a different focus (law, IEPs) and is written by a person in different profession (lawyer, teacher). It depends on what you want in a book. I'd save your money and check out several books at your local library (get them through interlibrary loan). Once you decide which one or ones you want, buy them online and then highlight the book and use Post-It notes throughout to help you later on."
5,What a Godsend!,"In clear and direct prose, the Wrights outline logical and practical ways to navigate the rocky shoals of the IEP process. Great suggestions, definitely worth your money and time."
3,"good, book but for more practical help. . .","This book was good, however, most of the content was merely a restatement of the relevant laws. For a book that gives parents more practical strategies they can really use, a must read is How To Compromise With Your School District Without Compromising Your Child by Gary Mayerson."
2,Am I missing something?,"Maybe it's just me, but I didn't find the book that helpful. I think that some of the information is good, but many parts were a bit condescending to parents. Now, I may not be an attorney, but I have more than a 5th grade education, so I don't need every little thing explained in order to make the book so repetitive that reading it is a chose and quite boring. Choose another book, one that actually thinks parents are intelligent and that is not as repetitive."
4,From Emotions to Advocacy Second Edition,Very imformative. Great book to educate yourself on how to advocate for your autistic child.
5,Wonderful Resource For Parents of Special Education Students,This is a wonderful book. It is an easy read. There are many practical ideas for becoming a better advocate for your child.
4,Great Guide Book,"This book is fantastic guide to all that is ice in Montana and Wyoming. The pictures provide a great asset to finding routes and ice flows off the beaten path. The wide variety of ice make the book a must for anyone who wishes to climb from beginner to advanced, there is something for everyone.The only downside is to those who are orienting themselves to an area for the first time. Some of the routes are hard to locate if you are not familiar with the climbing areas and the way they are oriented. The maps at the beginning help some with this, but the uninitiated will find it a little bit hard to find some routes their first time out."
1,Atari Flashback,Hated it. Modern TV's don't seem to play well this item. Had many problems trouble shooting to make it halfway work. After a month it quit working all together. I give it 0 stars even though I have to give it one to list.
2,"Ok Read, Maybe More If You Are Some Fanatic","The book is okay. As other readers have said I think the writer spent to much time on disecting every song, and talking about the various types of sub-genres of music. He spent so much time on the superficial things he left out so much about the twenty year career these guys have shared. It is an ok book but not even close to a rock biography such as ""Scar Tissue"" or ""Shakey"" the Neil Young Biography."
1,Bait and Switch,"This book is utter crap from the standpoint of a biogrpahy. In a bio I might learn about what makes some of the subject matter tick. We never even really delve into their personal lives, witht he exception of the already printed upbringings. This is a nerd fan analysis of every album, song, tour and the Thrash metal movement ( i use that term because honestly most of the movement was sheeit.) I cant belive this guy is a published author when he cribs most of his work from Kerrang and Hit Parader. To be hoenst I want my money back."
3,Good but not great,"Overall it was a very informative book based mostly on the music and quotes from other musicians. Kind of choppy in sections because stories seemed broken up with the interviews. I think it could included more stories about Alcoholica and things they did on tour. If you want to know everything about each song, this is the book for you. If you want to head about tours and crazy stories, you're better off ready Ozzy's book. I think it was good, but not memorable...."
2,Average at best,Im a long time Metallica fan. Im not a fanatic but grew up listening to them along with various other music varieties. That being said I am a music biography junkie and have read plenty of them. This is pretty poor. No real insight into the band. Most of the information is from other printed media and the writters opinions are to long winded. He repeatedly uses the term 'memorable' for songs which drove me nuts. This book could have been half the length. Buy it if your a Metallica fan but don't expect too much.
1,The Truth about Joel McIver's opinions,"I walked away with the distinct impression this book was more about Joel McIver than about Metallica.About 80% of it is his opinions on the bands music and the thrash metal genre overall, with some quotes from people within the genre included, and about 20% hard information on the band, it's members, and it's history.A big question to ask after reading any biography is what did you learn about the topic of the biography that you didn't already know. Unfortunately with this book, the answer is almost nothing.However I now do know what Joel McIver ""informed"" opinions are of Metallica, their music, the thrash metal genre, other bands in the thrash metal genre, and his opinions of those other bands and their music.While I understand any author will include their own thoughts about a subject in a biography, when they let those take over the majority of the work, they're misrepresenting what the book is really about."
2,Author needs to lighten up.,"First and foremost, I am a huge Metallica fan as the author states he is. With that said, I enjoy all of Metallica's music from every album with the exception of a couple of songs. Unlike the author however, I understand that musical styles change with time. The whole book is about the author complaining about Metallica's recent music and how it's not as heavy as the first three albums. Not worth the time to read."
2,Disappointing assessment of veteran band's 20+ year career,"Having read some initial buzz on this book, I was looking forward to it for a variety of reasons. No doubt about it, Metallica has forged an impressive career, dominating record sales, selling out hundreds of venues and providing enjoyment to millions of fans all over the world.Sadly, despite my high expectations, the book breaks little new ground. Almost all of the material within is simply a rehash of previous magazine articles and interviews. Even more disappointing, the writer's very open bias towards the band's earlier work leaves fans of the later albums (Load, Reload, etc) feeling like second-class citizens. It comes across not as an open-minded review of the band's career, but as a preachy 'better than you' attitude -- a complete turn-off."
1,"Too many opinions, not enough new info.","One would think that an opinionated, hypercritical analysis would make for an exciting read. NOPE!!!!!! Avoid this piece of junk. I hated it so much I'm avoiding this guy's Slayer book, inasmuch as I've always wanted to read a career spanning Slayer bio. The funniest part for me though, was when this guy offered his e-mail address so the reader can argue with him. Pathetic! Did I mention that this book should be avoided? The ""So What"" book and ""Some Kind of Monster"" DVD's were in fact self-indulgent pieces of cr*p, but at least the real players were involved. Hopefully when Lars calls this book professional, he's either being ironic or just showing us a kinder, gentler Lars after the whole Napster debacle, which, a decade later, with the recording industry on its financial knees, Lars was proven correct!"
4,Great start to a fresh new talent!,"For a first album, Ms Brooke Fasier has got what it takes! Some of here songs are catchy and if you don't watch out you'll be singing along very soon. There are a couple of songs that could have ended a few bars sooner...an error on the producer's end I think unless that's the way Brooke wanted it...but it's the producer's job to advise and bring years of experience into the picture. Nevertheless, this CD will give you a good after-taste!"
4,Simply delicious and touching,"Brooke Fraser, a New Zealand girl, offers with What to Do With the Daylight one of the most touching album of 2003. She introduces for our pleasure her musical influences, that go from Marvin Gaye to india.arie through the 11 tracks of her first album; 11 tracks she penned. She sings about relationships, desire, pain, simply about love. Her lyrics are the pure reflection of her voice: delicious and moving. She truly succeed in reaching the Beatiful with this first step in the musical industry. Served by interesting hit singles, Saving The World and Lifeline, What to Do With the Daylight reveals her young and talented songwriter and her very special musical landscape. Indelible, Lifeline, Mystery and Without You show her vocal abilities, a very sweet and clear voice and her potential. Here's the first album in a long career."
5,A Choice CD 4 any1 christin or non christian,"First of all i would like 2 say the kid who was putting Brooke down befoe it doesnt matter how long u have been a christian 4 maturity is measured in ur heart 4 GOD!!!! Now i went and saw Brooke at AGMF (Aust Gospel Music Fest) in Toowoomba in QLD this yeah and she is so awsome and i have friends who are non christians who love her music, because she dosent throw it down ur throat but she still gets the message across 2 her audience !!!!"
4,Very good,"If you are looking for sound product ratings and advice, this is a great book. As a first time mom-to-be, I was clueless about what to buy and where to buy it. This book is great for answering those questions. Some chapters are better than others. For example, I found the chapter on cribs to be particularly helpful, the chapter on clothes much less so. However, I didn't feel like this book directed me to a lot of ""bargains."" Again, the chapter on baby clothes was particularly bad in this regard. Many of the retailers listed in this book are very expensive, without any difference in quality or comfort being obvious.Overall, I highly recommend the book if you want good advice on baby products. Just don't expect to discover any great bargain hunting tips. You can probably figure most of them out for yourself."
1,Be Aware !!,"I bought this book because I was going to be a first time mom and didn't know anything about baby stuff. I followed everything the book said and I could not be more disappointed and angry. Some examples: this book said to get Huggies diaper because it was just as good as Pampers but cheaper. Well, Huggies leaked and got damp as soon as my baby peed. All the diaper problems went away as soon as I switched to Pampers. This book lists the amount of baby clothes you should get. Don't listen to it unless you enjoy doing laundry every day! The book also give its highest rating for Combi Ultra Savvy stroller. Just check out the rating and comments for this same stroller at Amazon. Need I say more? Just be careful new moms and dads. I don't think the authors did any research on their recommended products (like they claim to have done)."
5,essential for first-time mom's-to be...,"Being pregnant with your first baby is overwhelming, especially when you enter a baby superstore and have no idea where to begin. This book reviews and rates everything from maternity clothes to strollers to breast pumps. It gives you a typical baby budget and shows you ways to shave $2400 off what most people spend. In each category they describe stores, brands, websites & catalogs. My favorite feature is the ""waste of money"" lists that prevent you from buying unecessary items. I have already been browsing the web, comparison shopping with help from this book. I plan to take it with me to Babies-R-us when I get ready to register for gifts, using their handy sample registry of true essentials."
4,Great resource for parents-to-be,"I started with the Fields with their Bridal Bargains book, and now moving on to my next life stage, I found their Baby Bargains book to be another winner. I trust their no-nonsense, pro-consumer approach. But I don't necessarily follow them word for word either. For example, I am very pro-cloth-diapers and their bias is very strong. That's OK that we disagree on some matters. Their advice is usually right on target and has helped me save big bucks!"
3,"Some products are not so hot, but the authors like them","I love reading this book. It has many money saving recommendations, and I love all the websites, and places to buy inexpensive things. The only problem I have with this book is some of their recommendations. I highly recommend you do your own research on the web first. For example, I am currently researching twin strollers. The one that they HIGHLY recommend, and state is ""the best"" on the market, has poor reviews ... I recommend reading the ample reviews on amazon.com ... before making any purchase they recommend in haste. However, this book is a wonderful source of information, especially to the new mother, who is bombarded with a million different products, and doesn't have the time, energy or money to do tons of online researching."
3,Nice book if you need a kick start into finding bargains,"I received this book as a gift when I was pregnant and enjoyed reading the reviews and suggestions for saving money. However, I am a ""pro"" when it comes to saving money to begin with, so many of the suggestions were 'old news' to me. If you are not a natural at finding bargains, this is a great book for you. If you are good at saving money, you probably know most of the tricks they suggest. Also, keep in mind that many of the product reviews they give are the authors opinions--I felt differently about several products. For example, the authors hail over the Diaper Genie, and I really didn't care to use the Genie after a short period of time. Just something to keep in mind and know to take everything with a grain of salt."
5,The BEST baby products book out there,"Don't let the book title fool you. The book focuses on the BEST products for babies, not just the best bargains. Sometimes they'll even recommend a high-end item if it out-performs the others in quality and safety. The authors provide lots of practical advice on all of the current products out there today. I highly recommend this book! A must for any new parent...."
4,A real page-turner,"Be sure to carve out a weekend for reading because you won't want to put this one down. The second half moves especially fast, with unexpected plot twists. I look forward to reading Wagner's next work!"
1,Too SWEET!,"I love NOW products , but I can't get past the sugary sweet taste. I love a good tasting vitamin as muchas the next person. However.. this product is sitting half used in my refrigerator."
3,fairly thick,"I use liquid glucos/ Chond as I find it works better for me than tablets. This brand is fairly thick and I always need to drink water after this. The best brand I prefer as far as I have tried is ""!st step""."
5,Glucosamine/Chondroitin lLiquid,"Though the tste of Glucosamine/Chondroitin liquid is a little 'ugh', it is very good if you have sore aching joints. Mix it up with Aloe Vera juice to make it a more pleasurable experience; your joints will love it"
4,HGK likes NOW,My husband likes it. He cannot swallow large pills easily. This liquid he swallows easily & does not mind the taste.
3,taste,The taste is hard to take - the label says to refrigerate to keep the taste and I did but it didn't help.
3,Less accessible Satir,"Conjoint Family Therapy is full of good information, however its outline style makes the book difficult to follow. Unlike other Satir books, Conjoint Family Therapy seems targeted only to Psychotherapists. I missed the humor and humanity that characterizes other books by the author."
5,Worth the 4 year wait,"After four long years of full-length silence (an ep was released on Saltwater earlier this summer), the ever mighty Moose have returned with another solid tuneful album of unusual rhythms, subtle lyrics, and strange sounds. From the intro ""A Starting Point"" to the outro ""Twelve New Ways To Fly,"" Moose combine Yates' vulnerable and mellow voice with McKillop's chiming guitars (plus plucked strings, bongos, harpsichord, etc.) to produce a moody forty minutes of pop splendor. ""Wonder Where I'll Go"" and ""Lily la Tigresse"" rank among their finest melodies yet, and here's hoping another four years won't have to pass before Moose installment #5..."
4,the moose is loose,"My god man. This band has always been one of my favorites. They managed to survive the post shoegaze era, rotating members, and long lapses in-between albums. High ball me is good, not as good as ""honeybee"" or ""live a little, love a lot"" but still really good, and to think they only took about 6 years to release this! Anyway, I love moose, they can pretty much do whatever they want and it would still be good. Buy this and add it to yer collection. Acoustic guitars chiming away, strange background vocal arrangements (reminds me of catalina island?!) soothing vocals - a moose trademark, and the ever present sweeping melodies that make good pop music great. I wish House of love was still around, then they can hang out with moose and make more beautiful albums, oh well, we still have moose!!!"
5,"CD or MP3, PLEASE!","This is a wonderful collection that I have had for years, but it really needs to go digital."
2,Only 30 labels to a pack,"I love these labels and want to order more, but there is only 30 in a package not 50. Please check,this out. I was very disappointed with the inaccurate countRamona. Knight"
5,Worth the price of admission for any adventure gamer,"While this game is not truly perfect, it is atop its field. The graphics are as good as you will find in adventure gaming and actually look as good as most action titles. The problem this game faces is that by using a keyboard interface and streamlining the game, they limit the player to one inventory item at a time. This means that in many locations, you will do a lot of running around collecting items that could have been saved with even the most basic inventory system present in action titles.Still the voice acting is decent and the soundtrack is the best on the market. Best yet the story will keep you engaged, though you may find there are some difficult moments in interpreting the story if you are not familiar with the Wagnerian Opera the title is based on."
2,"Scratch your head, throw it in the garbage","I got this on the klunker shelf at EB Games, it was 4.99, and I feel as if 4.98 was just thrown in the garbage and I got my penny's worth.Why do these people breath in space?Why is there only three control buttons?Why is there no inventory?Why can't I change anything but the volume?Why are there no hints?Why is there no story line?Why is there no manual?Why do the controls work only 20% of the time?Why does no one and nothing even hint at what to do next or how to do it?Why am I trying to play this game?This is not on par with Myst or even The Longest Journey.This is certainly not on par with Lands of Lore or The Elder Scrolls.And if you are into Dungeon Seige or Neverwinter Knights, you'll really hate this.In fact, if anything but broken toys appeals to you, don't buy this."
5,Microwave cooking at its most complete,"Got this book when it first came out. Was wonderful. I discovered i didn't have to take an acorn squash, sit on the floor with a hammer and cleaver, and split it in two - just poke some fork holes in it and put it in the Micro for a few minutes.I've gotten used copies of this twice for wedding presents. It's the most complete book on microwaving I've found - and there have been lots out since then and my husband would say I have them all. But this is the one I go to when nothing else works!"
3,"Very funny, however...","I really like Gaffigan's material, his delivery and all, he is hilarious, however, he uses his high whiny voice WAY too much. It gets irritating after a few tracks. If he'd just speak in his normal voice all the time, I'd give this a better rating."
5,Jim Gaffigan: A true Prince of Comedy,"I met Jim in Saint Peterburg, FL, several years ago, and he is one of the most gentle souls in comedy. His act combines sarcasm with self-deprecation and even a little multiple-personality disorder thrown in for good measure (he constantly reviews his act while he's doing it in the voice of a bewildered audience member) and it is simply hilarious. He's just a big goofy doofus with a genius IQ and the ability to find the humor in just about any situation.If you've never heard Jim, do yourself a favor and buy this CD. It's a gem. Even better, listen for his appearances on Opie and Anthony on XM Radio Channel 202. Unlike some comics that can only work off their material, Jim is funny when he's just having a conversation and his XM appearances are radio gold."
5,Bust a gut,I'm in my 20's and I listen to this over and over. His humor is really on the mark... But I like the fact that my Dad and Mom like it too.
2,AAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH!!!!,"What happened to this band? I know the great Terry Kath passed and all, but was going disco the best way to honor his memory?Man, I'm just picturing one of my favorite bands all wearing leisure suits with their shirts open revealing mucho bling. We miss you Terry...but the band misses you more!!!"
3,This album deserves more props than it gets,"Having Phil Ramone on board was a good match for Chicago and a few tracks on Hot Streets wouldn't have sounded out of place on The Stranger or 52nd Street by Billy Joel. Songs like Alive Again, Hot Streets & Love Was New show theband is capable of turning out great material even after the loss of Terry Kath. Robert Lamm and Danny Seraphine shine on this album as well. One negative is that the rockers did seemed to be lacking the punch they needed to really be successful. I usually skip the Peter Cetera ballads on here too. Not an essential album in their catalog but mostly of interest to long time Chicago fans or those who like late 70s Billy Joel or bands (of that era) likePlayer, Pablo Cruise, etc."
3,An Enjoyable Album For Chicago Fans,"This is an enjoyable album that does not deserve much of the criticism it receives. While it is not one of their best releases such as 16 and 17, I still recommend it for Chicago fans to add to their collections."
2,Pass Me The CTA Please...,"I remember listening to a radio station that was giving away as many records as you could name in 10 seconds. The caller gets on and says, ""Chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc. I guess Hot Streets would have slowed the process.....Anyways Hot Streets is further document of Chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is...."
3,It has its moments,"Chicago's twelfth album released in October 1978 is an album of several firsts. It's their first studio album not to be numerically titled. It's the first to feature a group photo on the cover. It's the first album without James Guercio as their manager/producer. It's also the first album without Terry Kath who passed away nine months earlier. There were two singles: the upbeat ""Alive Again"" and the Peter Cetera ballad ""No Tell Lover"" which both reached #14 on the charts. There was a third single ""Gone Long Gone"". The Bee Gees sing background on ""Little Miss Lovin""-two Chicago members in turn played flugelhorn on their hit ""Too Much Heaven"".The album isn't bad at all but I recommend this only to Chicago fans. It's not one of their better remembered works. The band's earlier material including even some of their later material sound better than this."
4,"An easy introductory reader to Russian, but it's quite short","Useful for building up your reading confidence for very beginners. The first couple of texts are extremely simple, and all of them only use the present tense. I found the end-dictionary comprehensive enough for my use, although it didn't include some words from the Exercises that follow the texts, which is an unfortunate oversight. You will go through this book quite quickly though. I much preferred the slightly more difficult ""Beginner's Russian Reader"" by Lila Pargment since it is useful much longer, but is more difficult when you are first beginning. Its also unfortunately a bit difficult to find in the US for some reason although very easy to get in the UK where I purchased it."
4,not too bad,"This book is definately a 'first reader', as it is quite simple. All the text is in present tense. I do not mind this, but the thing that I find most wrong with the book is that it has a dictionary in back that ostensibly contains all words necessary for reading the passages, but in reality contains about 50% of them. This only means that one must look the words up in another dictionary. But at the same time, there are some words that have multiple meanings, and you look them up in a seperate dictionary, and will not be able to glean any meaning from a sentence. But overall, I have found this book to be very helpful."
2,This is a first book for someone who knows Russian.,"I had read several reviews of this book and thought it would be a good first reader. However, no previous reviewer stated that there is no translation! So, you really need to have a good command of vocabulary (nouns, verbs, adjectives)."
4,OK PRODUCT,"product works ok doesnt magnetize items all that strongly, but does do a decent job. would reccomend it for light magnetizing"
2,Not to be used with iPaq,"This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys.However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA. For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld. The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area. In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side. This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache.Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use."
3,"Connector stinks, but great keyboard.","Come on Targus, the connector for the Visor STINKS; and big time. I can't believe that you let this great product out the door with such a major flaw. How long do you think those 2 plastic clips will last. The keyboard works great (after you manage to connect the visor), and has a lot of nice features on the keys. Would recommend this only after the major flaw is fixed."
4,Love it...,"As a reporter, I decided to buy this keyboard because I was always taking notes at meetings. I would highly recommend it. I used it w/ my IPAQ, and it's lasted two years without ever having to replace the battery. After using it for a couple years, I've found it easier to type on then a regular keyboard. Takes a little getting used to at first.My only complaint is that it just randomly stopped working a couple times. Considering it happened only three times in two years, it's not too bad. Like I said, I really love mine and would recommend it to anyone else."
4,Nice design; but software a bit anti-social,"First of all, I'm not sorry I bought it. For times when I have to do some serious data entry, it's wonderful! The keyboard is as big as a regular keyboard, although the distance the buttons travel is a bit low.But having said that, I am a bit frustrated with the software that came with it. I use HackMaster, and AppHack, and (1) the application buttons do not work when AppHack is loaded, and (2) I always (regardless of HackMaster/AppHack) have to go into the Keyboard panel and turn the keyboard off, then on again, to get it to work. Once it's working, it works great, but then I have to backtrack if I want to use AppHack again."
3,I didn't buy it,"B2B has been around for a while, and organizations have created supply chains using IS.Class, what have been major challenges for B2B? How have organizations overcome these challenges?"
3,Does not work with Tungsten T3 !!!,"This handy keyboard, full size, does NOT work with the Tungsten T3 in spite of ""universal"" lable and implications of its working with the T3 in some reviews. The T3 is too big for the holder's wire guides. I have always enjoyed Targus products but I was very displeased to find this product so physically inadequate, not just for the T3. The plastic is flimsy, the IR port is clever but poorly designed, and the keyboard has some funny layout aspects. It attempts to meet all specifications of both Palm and PC devices and overstretches."
3,Not the Best,"I purchased the wireless version after I upgraded my iPAQ to Windows Mobile 03 software and couldn't get the drivers on my old Targus keyboard to work anymore. Too bad. Overall the keyboard isn't bad. It works fine. My biggest problem with it is the size of the keyboard. It's noticeably smaller. I use it primarily to take notes in meetings and am constantly hitting the wrong key because it's just not sized like a regular keyboard. That was not a problem with the other one.My other complaint is I would rather have the arrow keys back and get rid of the ""mouse"". I thought it was a great idea, but it's really more cumbersome in reality than it's worth--at least for me.My last complaint would be to beware Targus' customer service. I tried getting help when the drivers on the old keyboard quit working and got absolutely no response from them. If you end up having a problem with your keyboard, don't expect any assistance from Targus."
5,Fantastic,"An amazing piece of engineering. You'll find yourself folding and unfolding it just because it works so well. Lots of avaricious stares on airline flights... if the Visor had video out I'd never need a laptop again. Kind of a pain to attach the Visor to the keyboard, but I think that's a limitation of the Visor's design, not the Stowaway."
4,Works with Ipaq 2215,"I use the the Targus with an IPAQ 2215. I find that's it's indispensable, but quirky. The cradle (rubber covered stiff wires) works best for ""squared"" PDAs (my Ipaq has a rounded bottom and can rock), and you may need to tilt the PDA for the infared bar to point into your IR reader. (If you use a flip-style case, you will have to remove it for the IR bar to beam into your IR reader.) I'm not crazy about the cursor arrow key (it's not a regular cursor ""arrow"" key), and the split-up space bar keys do sometimes have problems. As another reviewer remarked, downloading the drivers from Targus.com is much easier than using their included CD-ROM."
1,it doesn't work,"This keyboard does not work with my Toshiba PDA altough it says it is supposed to. Also, the software made my computer lock up."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case. I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270. This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it. I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA. Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there. My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA."
5,It is Great,"I waited a 3 months before seriously reviewing the keyboard so I could give a overall review from a long term standpoint. This is the greatest accessory for a visor ever,and is a ""must have"" for every visor owner. I am in high school, and I use it for everything, I have not had to write a rough draft for a single english paper, and have been able to complete typed repots in study hall, saving me time (when people arent asking me what it is, how does it work and how much the whole setup cost.) Also, I notice many reviewers find it difficult to connect, I had no problem attaching it, and once I realized it only took a twist of my wrist to remove it was simple."
3,"Cool, but rather delicate","This is a very cool keyboard, and easy to type on. It is small enough to take anywhere since it folds up into such a small package. However, overall it does feel very delicate and I don't expect that it would last very long at all with heavy or rough use. Thankfully, I don't tend to be very hard on things, so I expect to get a reasonable life from it. I did have a small problem with one of the catches that allow you to fold up the unit and snap it closed, but was able to fix the metal piece that bent the wrong way one time so that it would ""catch"" appropriately again, and I've had no more trouble with it. Overall, I do like the keyboard, and consider it's small size to make it a worthy purchase if you get along well with delicate items!"
4,Must have accessory,This is an incredible accessory that has my PDA replacing a laptop. I use it to write design documents and reports.The only concern I have is that I have difficulty docking and undocking my PDA.
1,A difficult connection,"I am sure this is a fine product. But not for me. In the manual, it is mentioned that connecting the Visor to the keyboard may be ""a little difficult."" It sure was. I tried--literally for hours, and couldn't get it. I called Tech Support, and they were understanding of my trouble, they were not able to help. I was told, "" . . . maybe something is wrong with the keyboard or your Visor."" I returned my keyboard."
2,Almost usable but not quite,"This keyboard was designed with no key where your thumb expects a space bar. There is a small space bar to the left, and another to the right. Totally unusable. What a waste of a device that was almost useful."
1,Really bad,I bought this keyboard for my tungsten E handheld. I loaded into my computer and then my handheld it is soo stupid it doesnt work with palm os 5. Dont buy this it stinks.
2,"Close, but not quite","The book was full of great facts about alcohol and the teenage brain. If you are a parent of a teenager who is at risk of alcoholism or even a parent who is looking to inform themselves on the subject, it's a good book. However, if you are a parent currently dealing with a teenager with a drinking problem, this book will leave you wanting. Chris didn't see Toren's drinking as a problem until he checked himself into rehab at 24. Chris does give ideas of what to try with your teen, but she didn't actually deal with trying to get a teenage drinker sober. While a great resource, it won't provide you with that."
3,Okay,"This book is okay. But dont use this book if you expect it to teach you what you need to konw. Its good for reviewing. And as usual, because its from the Princeton Review, the format is quite good, and the language is clear."
2,TOO MANY MISTAKES!,"I took the AP calculus BC exam today after reviewing with this book. If I could review all over again I would without a doubt purchase another study guide. This book was riddled with errors. Some were minor (like an a missing decimal point in a problem solution) but others were major and completely unjustifiable (including an incorrect formula for the Taylor series of ln(x+1)). Also, this book does not contain any review of polar topics, which have been free response questions in previous years. After reading this book from cover to cover, I was left with the impression that it wasn't editted before being sent to press; an extremely subpar effort from a company whose test prep materials I had come to rely upon."
4,"It's a ""not-bad"" book, not the best","I took the AP exam this year, I used three AP books to prepare, of course it includes this book. This is not too good book if we compare this book to Barrons'. The test is kinda easier than the actual test, and it didn't give you explanation on the chapter problems. For those who need to know how to do the problems, this book won't really satisfy you. Get the Barrons' one, that book is much better. But well, like i said, it still a nice book for AP test.!!!"
3,Good item; cheap chain!,"I enjoyed receiving this item and wearing it immediately. However, on the second day, the chain just fell apart. Don't know why or whatever, but one minute it is around my neck and the next it is on the ground. I am buying a new chain and the medallion is what I made this purchase for so still and all I just glad I didn't lose the medallion."
3,"Great shirt, not so good quality.","Well I absolutely love Taking Back Sunday, and I abslutely loved this shirt too. I bought it with my own money, it took at least 4 weeks for it to get to my house, and when it did, I washed it once and the seam ripped out. Its not noticeable, but still, I spent alot of money on it and waited 4 weeks for it to arrive and I was not too impressed. You basically pay for the print on it, which is disappointing. It's a cool shirt, but it is a terrible quality and I do somewhat regret purchasing it...not worth the money at all."
4,"Good scanner, solid quality","Good scanner. Louder than i wish while scanning (but not extreme). Wish that push-buttons were a bit more programmable...you can assign some programs/actions, but would like better options. I generally just use the included software rather than the physical buttons. Good quality, fast scans."
5,Proud of Boyzone,"I just want to say that I was very glad that I really liked Boyzone cd, I am from Cork City, Ireland and now living in Virginia Beach, va. I am so glad I got this cd it is wonderfull and they can sing."
4,Great Tennis Beginners Set,This has been a great product whether one or more want to play. It enhances hand eye coordination in my children who are beginner tennis players.
5,Great family fun!,We take this everywhere!Fun for all ages and so far has been very durable. I thought for sure with my college age boys playing it that it would never last. So far so good. I have 11 kids and everybody of every age enjoy this. Don't hesitate to buy.
2,swing ball,"loved this game when i was a kid, and still love the game. i was disappointed how cheap the base is, the one i had as a kid was a metal post with a speared end the went into the ground was alot more sturdy than this plastic version."
2,The people in this picture must be midgets,"This set is nowhere near 6 ft tall as advertised. It might be 4 feet tall. It is so short that in some cases the ball almost touches the ground. I bought it for my grandchildren, who live in Argentina. I would return it if I could but it would be too expensive to bring it back. What a disappointment! Will not buy this brand again."
2,won't recommend,It's made with very cheap plastic couldn't use the pole at all not made of steel like years ago.Don't know how long it will last
2,4 year old gift,This will work for my 4 year old grandson but not sure it will be sturdy enough for older kids.
3,works for the price,"I picked this up cheap as a bedroom dvd player. It barely gets used, and I don't use it's progressive scan function, much less stereo sound (plugged into a mono 19"" TV), but it's been working fine without any skips or errors. My two biggest problems are in the design: 1) There is no led indication when the unit is powered on, so I can't tell if I've succesfully turned it off or not (there are only 3 leds on the unit that power on only during playback of dvd's/cd's/mp3's). 2) The remote is layed out extremely poorly. the eject button is where the power should be (the power button is a small grey button, like all the rest, hidden on the upper left, while the eject is a large red button on the upper right). The rest of the buttons are also indistinguishable by feel, so good lighting is always required when hunting for the pause or other buttons. But for the price..."
3,more lines from a post millenial Shecky Greene,"I am tired of seeing non-intergrated shtick being passed off as literature,. I consider myself a contemporary personage not a photocopy of a previous stereotypye. Why doesn't Mr. Sirowitz evolve."
5,A fond look back at gospel top quartet.,"Sure, this product is more expensive...but as the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."" This project is so cool. Beside the five remastered CDs is a huge, outstanding book with song history, quartet history, color photos of concerts, etc. If you are a fan of the Blackwood Brothers Quartet of the 50s with personnel including James Blackwood, R.W. Blackwood, Cecil Blackwood, Bill Shaw, J.D. Sumner, Bill Lyles, Wally Varner, and Jackie Marshall you do NOT want to miss this one-of-a-kind project. The studio releases during the 50s including a live California concert featuring some of the best Blackwood songs. I've never seen any gospel music release so extensive and professional. All songs recorded by RCA Records. Don't miss this one, or YOU missed out!!!"
5,Most 50's Blackwood Bros. albums in one place,This is a great set of 5 cd's and a very nicely made book of pictures and history of the Blackwood Brothers. Boxed in a really nice collector quality enclosure. The quality of the recordings is just perfect. I hope the producers will make more of the Blackwood Bros. and the Statesmen Qt. in this format.
1,Worst brand name battery.,I used this battery twice from different merchants. Both times my watch worked only 2 months on it. With Energizer I consistently get 14-16 months.
4,Great Game!,This is really a great game. I just bought the mac version because I remembered having so much fun playing the PC version when I was in high school. I've heard mixed things about the different sequels that have been made but the original version is really outstanding. I played my way though the military campaign in about a week and had a lot of fun. It's challenging but not so hard that it detracts from the fun.I know that now the mac version of this game is going for no less than about 70$ (which is what I paid for it) and often more but if you can get it for less than 100$ I think it is worth the price.
3,"OK - not the best, not the worst - TONS of sun salute series and about 75 minutes long","You do about 20 sun salute series in the beginning which gets a little old. About 75 minutes in length which is too long for me to do more than once a week - need about 40 minutes. Gets your arms burning, though!"
5,This video is great. It's a nice strong workout.,"This video is great. If you want to build strength, flexibility, and stamina this one is for you. It generates great heat which helps develop more flexibility. I feel energized after I do the workout every time. If you want to get in shape and keep your body in balance this is the video for you. I'm going to tell all my friends about it!"
5,Whew weeee,This is a great workout! I love all the total yoga series. This dvd will make you sweat for sure. Fast poses and constant flow keep you moving non stop. Beginners will need to watch first to get the flow and poses down. This dvd has some complex and difficult moves you may not be able to do on the first few runs. Practice makes perfect in my book. You will feel great after this baby.
2,Workout? Yes Yoga? Not in my opinion.,"I know I am the only person, so far, who is not entranced with this DVD. I bought it because it had such a plethora of glowing reviews. I am not happy I did.What drew me to yoga, after decades of long distance swimming, was the philosophical component of the practice. Yes, I love a strong work-out, and I do one every day (Ashtanga Primary Series, Hatha Vinyasa, or Yin-Yang), but I don't want my yoga to feel like an aerobics class. If that's what you're after then buy this DVD; but, if you want something with a bit more yogic depth I would recommend Shiva Rea's Solar DVD. (It may be sold as the Solar Lunar practice. I am partial to the Solar practice and the meditations on the Lunar disc.)The other thing I was not happy with when doing this DVD was the lack of music. Again, if you like your yoga sans music this may be the DVD for you."
5,Awesome Reading,I sat down and read this book in one evening from cover to cover. This book shows us that we can weather any storm if we have faith in God. I appreciate the author's willingness to share such intimate details of her life. This is a testimony worth sharing.
3,Old Time Radio: Detectives,"I love old time radio shows. When I and my husband travel we some times listen to old time radio shows. I love the all from drama to scary show. Some of the highlight shows from this box set are Dragnet and Mr. and Mrs. North. The 28 dollar price is a little high, but this box set comes with 20 discs! This is a must buy if you love old time radio shows."
5,Great listening,"Love falling asleep listening to my Old Time Radio. If you're a fan this cover several of the ""detectives"" from way back."
3,pretty good deal for 20 cds,"this is a pretty good deal for 20 audio cds. these shows are all in the public domain, and you can download these and 400+ gigs more for free [..]"
4,Interesting,"Stephen Fry, funny as always, combines his own life interests and his British viewpoint of 'The Colonies' and manages to find America as it is. He gets better at dressing American the farther he gets through all 50 States, too."
4,Fry's America,"I have not been so fortunate as to visit each American state, so when I read of Stephen Fry's trip around the country, I decided to go with him. It was ALMOST as good as a trip in person, or as close as I am likely to get.I've loaned it to friends and am beginning to despair ever getting it back!"
4,Another Brit Comedy,We are starting to view this DVD and it is funny. Of course it helps to be a great fan of British comedy.
5,A fun way to see America,"Really enjoyed Stephen Fry's DVD of his trip through America. It is always fun to see our country through the eyes of someone not of American birth, and hear what their take is on this great country of ours."
4,written review,"We decided to give Fry another chance, since we didn't like KINGDOM. Overall it was enjoyable, although we wondered at some of the choices, such as Aspen being the only area in Colorado. The ""spy"" stories were annoying."
1,Doesn't work.,I bought this phone refurbished and it doesn't even work....I let it charge for like 15 hours and absolutely nothing. Is there something I'm missing here?
1,Does what I bought it to do,"The pros: quality on Skype calls is fair to good; it works with both my landline and Skype; and it's cordless, which is essential for me.The cons (are many): poor button design; the phone does not offer many common phone features, including distinctive ring recognition, speed dialing, and allowing spaces to be inserted into alphanumeric entries; supports either Skype or Yahoo -- not both at once, which would be really nice.I also had some serious installation problems. VTech's technical support was useless, and I had to find the solution on my own.I needed a Skype compatible phone that was both cordless and would allow me to take calls from my landline, as well, and I got that. But this phone was probably put on the market before it was ready. Future versions might be amazing, but this one is disappointing."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"This game is horrible, I couldn't even get it to install on my computer. Tech support doesn't responded to any of my many e-mails and I've been waiting for a response for months. There is no phone number to call listed anywhere in the box or on the website. I was really disappointed because this looks like it could be a fun game, but I guess the manufacturer didn't want us to play it. Please read all these reviews before you even CONSIDER buying this product."
3,This Game Is Stupid,When I bought this game it looked realy cool. But I must say I was pretty disapointed. Well you start out with only a little money. Hardly anything. So you can only buy a little bit of stuff. I usally run out of money by half an hour. The customers have no faces. If you counld have a little more money to actully do something it would be a good game. :(:(:(
1,THIS GAME DIDN'T WORK FOR ME & IT PROBABLY WON'T FOR YOU!!,"When I saw the Mall Tycoon 2 game at my school book fair, I was so excited that I could get it and I thought it would be so fun to play. My Mom bought it for me for Valentines Day and I immediatly installed it on my computer. This took a while, but finally it completed. I crossed my fingers, hoping it would work b/c my cousin said it didn't work on her comp. when I bought her the same game for her bday. At first, I thought it was working but after all the names of the company's flashed by, it went back to my desktop. I tried everything and it still won't work. Mabye my system isn't up to date enought; i don't know. But after skimming through the other reviews, I think that the company that made this game is not that great since the other 1's said the same thing. DON""T BUY THIS GAME; IT IS A BIG RIPPOFF!!!!!"
1,Not worth you Money!!!,This Game is not worth your Money because it's very confusing.No tutriols to show you how to do stuff.All you have is the Instrution Manual.I like Roller Coaster Tycoon's CD's Better.
1,Mall Tycoon 2 (not worth buying),"I returned my copy, and I never do that but this game was that bad. It's a case of first game is ok, 2nd game thrown together. The graphics were very poor, something you would have seen developed years ago. The game was the worse sim game I had ever played. I was very disappointed."
3,Its not that bad.....,"This game isnt that bad at all, i dont know why people conplain about it so much,its a budget game what do you expect?Yes the graphics do look bad i have to agree with that altho the stores are well animated and it realy shows in the frist person veiw but the graphics in general its barely adequate .The game is realy fun becuase you have a lot of freedom out what you do like name the shop set the rent,mall tax and etc.The music isnt going to kill you it is good for a game, its not a crapy jazz and there is nothing wrong with the sound effect.The good:a lot of freedom what you get to do,cheap,the gameplay is very customizableThe bad:the people have no face, the graphics are block and blocky,there are some annoying glitchesOverall Scores:Gameplay:8(great)graphics:5(medicore)sound:7(good)value:8(great)tilt:7(good)Overall:7(good),you realy just have to weigh the good and the bad,its basicaly the average game."
1,Would've been fun...,I bet this game would have been fun...IF IT WORKED!!! This game wouldn't even start after I loaded it! I wouldn't waste your money on this. You should get RollerCoaster Tycoon instead.
1,Aimless game,"This is not a good game to play. I bought this game and tried to play it. After a while, I found that this game is not entertaining at all, quite confusing, and aimless. The objective of each mission is not so clearly stated and you are puzzled with its control panel. You'll have an array of building tools and options. But you don't know what to do with them. No tutorial included, poor 3D graphics, pity music/sound ambient, confusing gameplay, aimless obejectives.I wish I wasn't attracted to its cover and publisher notes at the back of the CD case. I suggest you to avoid this game. Buying this game is worthless, wasting your time, and not fun at all."
1,Don't waste your time,"At first I was all excited about buying Mall Tycoon 2. I thought it would be really neat, but I can't even get the game to run, it just goes back to the desktop everytime. This is my first Tycoon game I have ever bought now I am afraid to buy any more of them."
1,Dose not work.Waste of money,"I got the first mall tycoon for my birthday last year and it didn't work I took it back 2 times and got new ones and none of them worked. When mall tycoon came out I got it again for my birthday, I'm a huge fan of these kind of games have them all. But just like the first one the first 4 times I loaded it and it didn't work and when it did it didn't work good. Its a waste of money and a big disappointment, I was very excited by the concept of building the mall but all that happed was that i was disappointed."
1,"Waste of time, money and energy","This is undoubtedly the worst simulation game to have ever been released. The graphics are poor, even at the highest resolution; the game is both confusing and uninteresting; and the scenarios are, at best, uninspired. Don't bother with this game...buy Tropico, Zoo Tycoon, or something else designed by people with talent."
4,Loved it,"I thought this book was great.I loved each of the stories and the rooms they visited. ;)I wonder if there is such a hotel............... ah it would be fun.There was not one story in here I did not like, just wished they were longer is all. Each and every story was HOT and very entertaining. I gave it the four stars on account of the shortness of the stories. Some just were not told fully in the short amount of space I thought. The only fault I could find. Id recommend this book to lots of people."
3,A mediocre whodunnit with a predictable ending,"Tapply is a competent writer a notch or two below Robert Parker and by no means ""the best in the field,"" as some reviewers have claimed (in my opinion, that honor goes to either James Lee Burke or Elmore Leonard). In this novel, the lawyer Brady Coyne takes many chapters to solve a mystery (the death of a client's wife)which the average reader likely solved immediately. Despite Tapply's attempts to ""flesh out"" minor characters, they nevertheless seem flat and stereotyped, such as the ruthless gangster Russo and his henchmen. The novel's best feature: a helluva good genie joke somewhere near the middle."
4,Good for XP but not that great for Vista,"Connects to computer easily, but Vista sync software does not function properly with the unit. It does give you the option to drag-drop files to the iPaq but the sync doesn't work. When in charging station the screen is always on with the Dock Ware on the iPaq."
5,Holy Transformation,"If your desire is to be transformed by the Holy Spirit, please read this book. I can't get to the end because I'm still being transformed. Must read book. Thanks Chip. yoa"
1,not very good headphones,"I really expected more from these headphones. The only advantage that they have is that they are foldable but be careful, they are fragile so don't bend them too much.The quality of the sound is fair, the same that you would get with ones half the price. For the price I paid for them I thought that at least they will have a better sound quality.The part that goes into your ear is too big and too hard so you wouldn't find them extremely comfortable.I recommend you to spend a little bit more and buy one of those cools sylicon headphones that go directly into your ear and have a much better sound quality."
2,Poor quality,Bad fit. Snapped in half with first use. Only reason not one star was return worked well.
3,Decent,"These are good for sound, but they have to be in your ear at just the right angle it seems to get optimum quality, and they stick directly in the ear instead of at an angle, so they are slightly uncomfortable."
2,Nothing new here....,"Zappert's survey-based research provides no new insights or solutions for working moms. Basically, it's ""work or don't as you feel comfortable, and outsource as many non-parenting tasks as you can."""
5,Great Buy,"I own many pieces of the Candice collection and love them all. The brushed steel is modern and chic, and the alabaster glass is beautiful. Highly recommend it."
4,multi-colored crystals,I wasn't expecting the crystals to be so rainbow colored. I thought they would be gold/clear. so wasn't happy with that aspect only because that's not what I wanted. other than that the shoes are very nice. the size was true.
2,Wow Total crap,If you like movies with no plot and fat ugly lesbian love scenes then this is your movie. I have a large zombie movie collection and this is one of the worst and that is saying something! The only reason I gave it two stars was the title makes me laugh. Save your money and buy toilet paper cause either way you put your money towards crap.
1,A bit too much of a cliche,"I wanted to like this book but found it disappointingly pallid. The cover made the novel look tempting and I like the idea of a novel about China with a lot of scope. ""Dream"" starts out interestingly (though the first paragraph is badly overwritten), but somehow the history takes over, and I sometimes felt as if I was getting a condensed survey of Chinese history ater 1911 rather than the main character's story. Also, the writing is somewhat cliched and clumsy--that took away from my ability to appreciate the narrative flow. All in all, I would recommend other books in this ""genre""--Jung Chang's ""Wild Swans,"" or Pang Mei Chang's ""Bound Feet and Western Dress"" over this one.ge"
5,for those who love literature about China,"I can't add much more to what others have written. I also loved reading it and still remember scenes and characters as if I had been there, which is the mark of great writing. It mostly takes place in Changsha, Hunan."
5,Extraordinary Parallelism,"The thread that binds cultures is stronger and more firm than most people think. Complicating beliefs in order to make them seem original has nothing to do with their essence. Underneath it all they spring from a common source, with an extraordinary parallelism. God is God, no matter by what name. All of that and more is embraced by this amazing book, beautifully written, thought-provoking, a reference source for a lifetime of consultation. Highly recommended."
5,Perfect Christmas Present,The poster arrived quickly and was in perfect condition; I'm very happy with my purchase!
3,Didnt last very long,It only lasted about a month in my lcp laser. It is possible I guess that my wife carried it and it was on while it was on her.
2,An interesting idea ruined,"Started off OK but soon deteriorated into the realms of utter absurdity. The presence of William Desmond Taylor would have been much more effective if it had merely been implied . When the present day cop started to argue with Taylor's ghost - particularly so early in the book it all became a bit silly and I quickly lost interest. Would have been much better to have simply ""Dropped Hints"" to suggest the great man's presence and then brought him into the foreground action much further into the book. An interesting idea ruined by shortening the suspense."
5,Good value for money,"These wiper blades are good and a great value for money. This fits the passenger side of Honda CRV 2008. I brought the driver's side wiper also, but anco wipers don't fit the driver side of a CRV and I had to request a refund. So be careful. Overall I am pleased with this wiper. It wipes silently."
4,This book is a powerful tool.,"Before I had even finished the second chapter, I was forced to examine the nature of my Jewishness, what it means to me, what role it plays in my life, and what role I wanted it to play. I didn't want to put the book down! I couldn't wait to see what further revelations were in store for me. Mixed Blessings provides a context in which couples can explore their deeply-ingrained beliefs and attitudes. In this way, it can help people in interfaith relationships to determine their own cultural, spiritual, and religious identities, and to better understand the complex origins of their conflict."
1,Out-dated for our multicultural world,"This book was written about a marriage that started in the sixties. It is simply out-of-touch with the realities of our multicultural world. Those of us who were raised to value diversity won't have much use for the lessons imparted by this books' authors. It simply isn't relevant to couples in the twenty-first century. And thank goodness for that. Read Mary-Helene Rosenbaum's ""Celebrating our Differences"" instead."
5,A first rate pocket book,This little book delivers the goods ~ well-organized marks for the English silver sleuth. Also has a credible selection of silver styles thrown in as a little bonus.
1,the dataset is not available so one can't practice the method,"The book as such is great, one of the few truly introductory texts on mixed-effects / multi-level modeling that is comprehensible even for beginners. However, the data set is not available for download and the author as well as the publisher do not react to inquiries so one can't rerun the analyses to see whether one understood it all."
5,i havent read it yet,"i havent read the book yet but will be very glad if u could send me a review of the book , especially details about competency building through assessment centres. i am writing a researc paper on the mentioned topic and have been unable to get this book by david beard. i will be grateful if i am send the information at the earliest. thanking u , sincerely yours aparna my email address is aparnadhingra@usa.net"
2,Poor Quality...,"I am so disappointed with this product! It is definitely better than the boppy though. It angled my daughter perfectly, it is a great idea but the quality was so cheap by the second day it had completely fallen apart. The zipper was ""zipped"" but yet was coming open in the middle and when I went to exchange it they told me they couldn't accept it because it had breast milk stains on it. Luckily I learned how to nurse without it, but I'll never see that money again. I wouldn't buy it, it's only something you'd need in the very beginning and then it would just collect dust anyway..."
2,A total pain,"I'm not sure if I'm more bummed out by the pillow or the cover, but I bought this cover so I'd have something to use when my babe barfed...or worse...all over my pillow. When I washed the cover some of the inside stitching started to come unraveled. Then when I tried to put the cover on, good god, it was absurd. It actually makes me want to ditch the whole pillow. You need two hands, a good 5 minutes, and a lot of patience to stuff the cheap foam 'pillow' into the cheap case and zip it up. Mine is still all crooked because after at least 5 full minutes of wrestling with it I just gave up.Oh, and this pillow does NOT have the new velcro buckle. The buckle is the normal style and not as adjustable as the covers for the deluxe pillows."
3,Great Comedian but repeats his jokes,"Don't get me wrong I think Mike Bahooski is a great comedian, but there are several bits on this cd that are on others. I would suggest buying ""My secret public journal"" over this as I believe you will get more laughs."
1,Old material - not funny a second time around - save your 14 bucks,"I was a big Mike Birbiglia fan and wouldn't miss an opportunity to see him perform live. I heard that a new CD was being released and bought it without hesitation.To my disappointment, this CD is 80-90% material reused from his 2004 album ""Dog Years"".There is a DVD accompanying the CD that has a couple of good standup routines from Comedy Central, but again, they're old material.I won't disagree with the other reviewer who like Mike and his talent as a stand-up. But ""Dog Years"" sounds like the first album of a up and coming comedian who's hungry for the applause and working hard to get it. If you don't own it, you should. It's a good album.Then you can go ahead and skip buying this one."
1,comedy for fools,"Listening to this corndog city is a complete waste of time. It sucks. It isn't funny, which is the only complaint that should matter when reviewing a comedy cd. I can honestly say that I listened to the cd straight through without so much as cracking a smile once. IT'S NOT FUNNY! It's corny and lame. I was wondering what drugs the people in the audience were on to be laughing consistently at this drivel. This guy is the next Bob Saget, and I can't believe how cheesy people are to think that this junk is humorous. If you want some real laughs, try listening to Lewis Black, David Cross, or Mitch Hedberg...comics that are actually funny. Sorry Mike, I know that you're trying, but you need some new material."
2,"If you have ""Dog Years,"" go ahead and avoid this purchase.","I purchased this because I think Birbiglia is a really funny comic, and I really enjoyed his first album ""Dog Years."" I was excited, beacuse a full album worth of new material would be well worth my money.Unfortunately, ""Two Drink Mike"" is composed almost entirely of the SAME material as his first album. The final four or five tracks are new, but everything before it is simply a rehash of previous material, occasionally with a new quip thrown in before or after a specific joke.My advice is that if you already have ""Dog Years,"" go ahead and avoid this purchase. For the most part, it's nothing you haven't already heard before, though it's just as funny. If you don't have ""Dog Years,"" then jump on this one instead, since it has much of the same material, plus the extra DVD."
3,Not the Kenny G of Comedy (and that's a good thing),"Birbiglia's clever lines are delivered with a certain cuteness and shyness and perfect deliberateness. He remains endearing and seemingly humble with a certain childlike innocence as he makes observations about life, dating, family and the ridiculousness that surrounds him.Birbiglia doesn't hesitate to poke fun at himself, his whiteness (he loves the word ""cracka""), his weight (""I'm not the kind of guy who has a huge weight problem, but I am the kind of guy who can really put the brakes on an [...]""), and his obsession with bears.If Birbiglia's observations, stories and jokes don't make you laugh, your funny bone may very well be broken. Come on! Who doesn't like panda porn?"
2,Black numbers fade in one wash!,The shirt itself seems ok but the black screen printed numbers are done with really crappy ink. I hand washed this shirt once in cold water and the black has become see through. You can now see the orange behind it. I dont know what will happed dare I wash it again.
5,Dukes of Hazzard Shirt,My son received this shirt as a christmas present and was extremely happy with it. It fit great and washes well.
5,Very happy with pens,"Extremely hard to find green fine tip porous pens. At local office supply stores, i.e., Staples, Office Max,Office Depot, they only have green pens like this in sets. So, if you want one,you have to take all the other colors. These arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted. Definitely very happy with these pens. Used them to write my Christmas card messages."
4,Great Value,"I recently purchased this keyboard and am very satisfied with the value I got. Of course, be aware that you are buying an inexpensive keyboard and it is not going to be as good as they a $1000+ keyboard. This is def. NOT a professional device.But for what I paid, I am very happy. Sure, the stand doesn't really fit the keyboard, but it works well enough. It sounds OK, even though for loud output, you need external speakers. Keys are touch sensitive but not weighted.But for home use, you get a lot fo your money. Some of the features are aimed at amatures and people who want to learn."
3,"Nice keyboard, but ...","The Yamaha PSR295 is a very nice keyboard, and our family has been very excited about it in the few days we've had it. However, Amazon made a mistake in bundling with it a keyboard stand that doesn't work with the Yamaha (the ""PKBS1"" from some company ashamed to put its name anywhere on the product or the packaging). The supporting arms are simply too large to fit in the built-in arm-rests on the underside of the keyboard.So we're going to buy another keyboard stand, one that Yamaha recommends for use with the Yamaha PSR295. We suggest you do the same."
3,Buyer beware,"This is a good price but beware, the stand it comes on will NOT fit the keyboard! Still having said that it's a great price but if you really need a stand (and you will) this will not fit."
4,Superb,This is my first keyboard...The sytem was delivered in a safe pack and the stand is very simple to assemble and looks good... I am thrilled ..but only thing is i know nothing so need to go for some formal course to learn..I belive its a good deal for entire kb stand and adaptoronlything is the delivery time..I got it after 3 weeks though I was promised after 6 weeks anyways I am happy about it.. I know a guy who bought 3 of these he is a professional kb player...I think if you are interested in buying a good one for learning and as well performing this is good..Speakers are too good..the clarity of the sound is amazing...but I am just a newbie...have an expert opinion before deciding on the product... All the best.....
3,Klondike steel toe,"Although I liked the shoes, the steel-toe part was really uncomfortable around my toes. This pair of shoes I returned."
3,Chicago went into the 80s... Being a 70s Band...,"This 14th effort of this American Superband showed two main things: (1) A great 70s band, may not work well trying to ""sound like"" an 80s band; (2) Tom Dowd made a certainly poor effort producing this album.However, Peter Cetera's voice sounds as good as in previous albums; there are some very nice tunes in this album (Upon Arrival, Song For You, Thunder and Lightning, The American Dream) not available in almost any previosuly issued Chicago Hits compilation, plus some new bonus tracks, the remastering work done by Rhino is excellent...... So this is an album mostly recommmended for all serious AOR, American Pop-Rock and Chicago fans."
2,Better than its predecessor but still a dud,"""Chicago XIV"" is an improvement over its predecessor. For one thing, keyboardist Robert Lamm, by far Chicago's best and most prolific songwriter in the band's glory years, had been in a real slump on the previous two albums. ""Upon Arrival,"" composed with bassist Peter Cetera, wasn't much to write home about, but on his more uptempo contributions, Lamm sounded fired up again. ""Manipulation"" was good, as was ""Thunder and Lightning,"" cowritten with Cetera and drummer Danny Seraphine.But it was Lamm's ""I'd Rather Be Rich"" that served as the album's highlight -- it's musically fresh, and the lyrics consitute a scathing indictment of the yuppie lifestyle.Too bad the rest of ""XIV"" sinks under the weight of Peter Cetera's soft-schlock balladry. Cetera writes or cowrites six of the albums' 10 tracks, including the yawners ""Song for You,"" ""Hold On"" and ""Overnight Cafe."""
3,Gets Better With Repeated Listenings,"When I first bought this album back in 1980, I thought the best thing about it was the thumb print cover art. I was disappointed in the music. Until then, every Chicago album had at least two or more stand-out songs that I would look forward to hearing when playing the album all the way through. This album is what some would call a ""grower"" that grows better with repeated listenings. Still, its not their best work. ""Manipulation"", ""Thunder and Lightning"", and ""The American Dream"" eventually stood apart from the rest for me."
2,Chicago's worst album,"Chicago's worst is still better than a lot of bands ever recorded. Chicago seems to be going through the motions on this release. The death of Terry Kath and the drug use appears to have hit rock bottom. Nevertheless, there are some decent songs here, but nothing really good. The good news is that after Chicago released Chicago 15, a greatest hits volume II release, they started to get it together on Chicago 16. Bill Champlin added needed vocal ability and song writing ability. Also, guitarist Chris Pinick, who first appeared on Chicago 14, was a great improvement over Donnie Dacus, who replaced the deceased Terry Kath."
2,Sorry-not enough good stuff!,"I would give five stars for the wonderfully craftedChicago classic ""Thunder And Lightning"",as great a pop song as this band ever made.But aside from that and the spiky newwave of ""Manipulation"" ""14"" earns it's two stars just for those songs and only half a star for ""Manipulation"".Nothing else here be it ballad or uptempo rocker even earns a mention and aside from yet another clever cover jacket this is'nt worth music musically."
1,What We're they Thinking,I'm A Big CHICAGO FAN(Still Missing Demon Dogs) . This Album Was I'd hate To Say The Worst Album Besides Tweenty 1. It Was A Bad Time For The Band I Know. It Was The 3rd Album After Terry Pastaway. There Is Only One Song I Like On The Cd/Album. SONG FOR YOU: That Is A Great Song Of The Band. The Other Tracks You Could Take It Or Leave It. Track 1 And Song For You Is It. If Want To have The Cd Ok. I Would Not Pay A Lot For It
5,Great poduct,Purchased for older laptop using ddr memory. Item came in superfast and works great. Will purchase from this deller again.
5,Captivating!,"This was a great book and I could not put it down! Culp writes with authority on the inner workings of the research department in a U.S.-based brokerage firm. While fiction, my suspicion is that some/much of the book is based on personel experience, making the plot even more enticing. The settings and characters in the book are all true to form and what is fascinating is to see how each character reacts to the glamour and money of wall street. The novel had characters that I was rooting for and those I hoped would get what they deserved."
3,pen and ink should have been oil,I enjoyed this book and I suspect that the complexity of the subject is better treated in a novel than an essay but I found myself longing for a little more Kurt Anderson-Tom Wolfe-Charles Dickens than I got from Michael Culp. I don't know what any of the characters look like. So many comic and satirical opportunities rise up and disipate without really getting those belly laughs or drawing the reader along. Nice book for those of us who eat and sleep this stuff but could have been a great novel.
3,Arginine/Ornithine ratio,"According to the label, here is theAmount Per ServingL-Arginine hydrochloride ... 2.25 gL-Ornithine hydrochloride ... 750 mg"
5,Another great novel of him,"The Pysk Jinnarin and the grouchy Mage Alamar go on a worldwide travel to find Jinnarin's husband Farrix, whom Alamar owns a favour. And they realize, that Farrix has found out the secrets of a dark mage and is now his prisoner. Now they not only have to free Farrix, but also defeat the dark plans of the dark mage. Again McKiernan tied me to his book, and again I lived in another world while I read it. I just gotta say that every Fantasy fan would love it, and that I sometimes couldn't stop laughing because of the parts in which Alamar and Jinnarin can't stop making trouble with each other, even when their situation gets really dangerous. Not quite his best book, but definitely his funniest."
4,Excellent read for the avid & passionate reader of the genre,"Well, since this is the first time I read a book by Mr. McKiernan, I have to say the book is not bad. I do love the philosophical & theological ideals of the book, but too much details can kill good storytelling. I personally think the book needs some trimming to really pack a punch! I was drawn within the first seven chapters but when Aravan & crew showed it up it slowed down too much. There was too much rambling about pollution, good vs evil, & the ethics of humans while drifting out to sea while searching for Farrix. I kinda found as useless. I had to put the book down several times becuz it got boring. But when I finally finish the book, I asked myself. ""Self, is this a good book"" Hell yeah it's a good book! But I do not recommend this book to people who don't read often."
2,Epic talking.,"Voyage of the Fox Rider is about a female Pysk and her search for her missing husband. With the help of Humans, Dwarves, an Elf, a couple of Mages and the fastest ship on the waters they will find him. But only after chapter and chapter of talking, debating, defining, lecturing, arguing, name calling, joking, and other non-action scenes. Oh, there is some action. Some. Out of 588 pages there is, to my knowledge, three real battles between th Good guys and the Bad guys.Think Middle-Earth but with half the fat and taste. Read if trapped in the hospital or in jail."
3,Good but boring in some parts.,I liked this book and the whole overall plot but it just took to long to get to the point. The plot is one of the Wee Folk is haveing nightmares about a crystal tower and a green sea. Influenced by the dreams she goes on a quest to find her missing lover who is somehow sending these dreams to her. The story has some good action sequences and the story moved along enough to keep my interest to the end. I have to complain about the political influences I don't want to read how evil man is and how he is detroying the environment when I read a fantasy novel.
2,Slow Pace,"I'm usually a reader that doesn't see much negative things in this book but this was the worst Dennis has written. The action is very slow and it takes forever to get a point across. One of the main characters always probes what the other main character says and wastes 3-5 pages on thought and mindless discussion that wastes your time. No action, slow pace, bad plot not a good read."
1,Slow and awkward!,"This is the first and last book by McKiernan I'm going to read. The story line itself wasn't bad, but the way he writes is truly awful. Everything is explained in pains-taking detail via long drawn out conversations between the characters, in completely unrealistic dialog. And the plot moves along s-o-o-o-o-o-o-o slowly! It took me almost a year to finish this book. I wanted to like it, but I'd read a few chapters and then see some other book I'd rather read...and I rarely put down a book once I start reading it! I don't usually submit negative reviews, but I don't know how anyone could give this 5 stars!!"
2,for kids,This is a movie for kids which I didn't know when I bought it because there was no information about it on Amazon. If you can get past the stupid stuff it had good information. Just don't expect much.
3,pittsburg?,"this is the classic football book, on a par with jim bouton's ""ball four."" it should be enjoyable for any football fan, but fans of the 4-time super bowl winners should be especially appreciative of this chronicle of the team written during the year of franco's ""immaculate reception."" it is extraordinarily funny and informative, eye-opening even. this being said, it was no pleasure trying to struggle through all the mistakes that were made, either by the author or by this current publisher, the university of pittsburgh press (i am inclined to blame the publisher.) this is the 30th anniversary edition for pete's sake. can't you get it right after 30 years? it is so bad that the publisher even misspells the city in which it is located, pittsburgh pennsylvania has an ""h"" folks. you're not in kansas anymore.but if you can get past the fact that you might have to read several sentences, maybe even paragraphs, an extra time or two to be sure what the author means, this is one great story."
3,Not the best,"I've been wanting a fillet knife for some time but didn't want to invest a lot of money in something I rarely need. It didn't fillet as well as I was expecting the first use though the feel in my hand and the sharpness of the blade made me think it would be good. For the money, it's okay but if you are someone who uses a fillet blade often, go ahead and spend the cash for a superior brand."
4,kershaw fillet,"Knife is of good construction and quality and price is very good. functional, safe sheath of rubber/plastic comes with. Blade is just right for small to medium fish and steel seems good."
3,Rust Spots 2 hours after 1st use,Brand new knife used to fillet two freshly caught saltwater trout. Rinsed off blade at the bait house and by the time I got back home 2 hours later to clean my gear about 15 tiny rust lines had appeared on cutting edge of the blade along with one small rust spot on the side. Nice grip but disappointed with the rusting.
4,An excellent buy on a good knife,"I bought this 7"" Kershaw to replace its 9"" big brother as a component of my take-along gear when I go bottom fishing. This is a good -- not great, good -- knife at an excellent price. The rubberized handle give it a solid feel, and the blade holds a good edge that can easily shave the hair on your arm. My only complaint about the knife is that the blade is a bit too narrow, making it overly flexible.While the 9"" Kershaw is of equal quality and feel, I found it too long to the point of being unwieldy, and the extra length amplified the flexible nature of the blade. The 7"" is really the perfect length for a general use fillet knife."
4,We are all at different levels of understanding,"I read this book several years ago, and continue to recommend it to my friends and book clubs. As I read the various reviews, many who were dissappointed with this book seem to be emotionally charged about the situation in the middle east. Unfortunately, there are many in the populous who are not quite as educated, nor as emotionally charged by this particular situation. This book does a wonderful job of reaching out to those who want to begin to understand the human aspect involved in this, and many other conflicts. As a mother, and one who has lived in Africa amidst severe and tragic conflict, I found this book to be both timely and engaging. Wilentz does a good job of character development without political judgement. Not an easy thing to do when conveying such charged subject."
1,Don't Ask Me Why,"I love almost all books about Israel and Palestine. I can love Thomas Friedman and also Yaron Hazony; Amos Oz and Meir Shalev, right wing and left, fiction and nonfiction. So, don't ask my why because I cannot give a rational answer as yet, but I really disliked this book. I only know that it did not grip me and that I do not recommend it at all. Somehow I found it dreary without redeeming artistic qualities. Somehow I plowed through it but am left feeling emptied not full. Don't yet ask me why."
2,"Not a Great Book, Others are better.....","on the Palestinian reality, especially, I strongly suggest reading as soon as you are able, Masha Hamilton's wonderful rendition of Palestinian Village life in the past, ""Staircase of a Thousand Steps"", which far better connnects to this People and their Plight than does Ms. Wilentz who doesn't as other reviews have stated, really get beneath stereotypes. I love all novels about the Mideast but this one just doesn't cut it."
2,Should have stayed with nonfiction,"I loved Ms. Wilentz' work on Haiti, a country I came to know well. She wrote brilliantly. I also know, not as well, the Middle East she writes about in Martyrs' Crossing, a book I read the minute it was available.I wanted to love it, but could not. It is not a good novel because it is more a parable than a plot. There is something terribly predictable here, and also I felt there was a steady greyness, like rain, running throughout the entire narrative. I believe the author would have been wiser, and benefited her many readers, to stick with non-fiction. That's because for a novel one needs more interiority, less predictablitiy. There is something too pat about her descriptions of the region, even though she clearly knows the current political realities. That's not the point. She doesn't know how to write a good novel. A shame..."
1,A Serious Disappointment,"I've read so much good about this book. I'm a reader who trusts my own tastes and I read this one all the way to the bitter end. It is a serious disappointment because the hoopla and hype are not anything like what is in the covers here. I'm not immune to seeing the Mideast conflict from many points of view. But I am immune to poor prose, what is here, I regret to say, in almost every page. Bad dialogue. Poor characterizations. I've really nothing positive to say about this novel, except I hope that Ms. Wilentz goes back to non-fiction."
2,Very Disappointing,"As a great fan of books dealing with the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict, I opened this book with high hopes. But I was terribly disappointed. This book needed a great deal of editing it did not get, and a few re-writes too. It doesn't get to the depth of a situation that so badly needs elucidating. This book doesn't succeed on any count: not as a good read, not as an elucidating read."
4,Equal to the Complexity,"Wilentz creates real characters that embody the political complexities and moral ambiguities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She also powerfully evokes the phsycial setting. I don't think she quite follows through on the fate of a couple of the major characters, however, which made the ending feel a bit abrupt."
5,"Suspense, Politics and Humanity","Amy Wilentz impressively weaves intrigue and politics into her artfully plotted story of MARTYRS'CROSSING. This is a fine accomplishment, particularly with its very human characters, which bring to life the complex world of Palestinian and Arab conflict. Readers of beautifully told stories filled with suspense, and readers interested in the Middle East alike will be moved by this very accomplished first novel."
2,Cardboard Characters & Tedious Sentence Structure,"This book isn't bad. But from Amy Wilentz we expect much better. I was stuck by the writing itself: the short sentences, the lack of pitch, the frequent cliches. If this were a first time author, okay, I'd give her a big break. But as all the press releases show: she is an award-winning writer. Since I am going to Palestine next summer, am Palestinian-American on my mother's side of my family, I wanted to find my voice and my family's voice here. I did not. Perhaps, my intimate relation to the Palestinian-American community made the ""character flaws"" more obvious to me than it is or will be to other readers. But there are flaws here and serious ones."
3,Yesteryear family movie with fantastic songs,Raj Kapoor & Nutan's old movie - amusing with fantastic songs. Must see for the film buffs.
3,This is the pressurized filter with one exit hole,"Recently bought a Krups XP series espresso machine but the filter included is this double layer ""pressurized"" type where all the espresso is forced out of one pin hole. I was looking for the unpressurized filter for the XP models but this is NOT it. This is the pressurized version.The problem is that this pin-hole clogs easily and produces fake crema. You can basically put the largest grinds in this and not tamp it and it will still produce crema, which is not a good thing. In fact, we can't even tamp down the grinds with this or it becomes clogged after a shot or two."
4,Low-key cousin to Volume 1,"At first listen, this more subdued, darker-eyed cousin to Vol. 1 is a rather underwhelming experience -the vast majority of the pieces seem somewhat one-dimensional and over-repetitive. However, a certain hypnotic beauty does reveal itself on ""Ether"" and, in particular, the stately ""Batwings"" after repeat plays. While there is nothing here to match the chilling dynamics of ""Are you shivering?"" from Vol. 1, ""Tiny Golden Books"", which almost threatens to transmutate into bubbling techno, ""An Emergency"", a short, frosty, Rose Mcdowall-sung piece, and ""Paranoid Inlay"" are just interesting enough to redeem the exercise. As with most of Coil's work, it grows more interesting and nuanced with each play..."
2,not what I'd expected,"this cd just wasn't up to par with the other music I've heard from Coil. I was looking forward to an experience like Who'll Fall or Red Birds Fly... but instead pretty much everything on this cd just seems rather repetitive and somewhat silly. the lyrics drip of angst, and I guess I'd just expected more from this."
5,Live your life and let your kids live theirs...,"The authors put their fingers on a real phenomenon: parents over-programming their kids to the detriment of parents and children alike. The first step to solving a problem is admitting it. In clear, straightforward language thankfully free of jargon, Rosenfeld and Wise give the reader an opportunity to reconsider the meaning of good parenting. I discussed the book with two of my kids who responded with a loud ""Duh, Dad, didn't you know that?"" I admit, I didn't, but I do now."
4,Release the stress for the modern parent,"I bought this book because of many excellent reviews. It is really useful and provides some new ideas that help the modern parent, like me, to release from the stress of over-child-support. This stress has been started before the baby was borne till my child is studying in the primary school now in my case."
5,The Over-Scheduled Child,"This is one of the best books I've ever read! I knew for awhile something had to give; this book gave me the courage to sit down with my family and truthfully discuss what is most important to us. The most important words were the author's statement of our children always striving to be better, and in the process, we are actually conveying the message that they just aren't quite good enough yet!"
1,Repetitive and poorly documented,"I can't agree with another reviewer more - this book can be condensed and the message given out in 10 pages - mostly because it is written more as an opinion without much examples. I was looking for some concrete illustrations to support the authors' points and there are extremely few. If I want to write a paper, this book will provide very little evidence. The authors just drag the topic on endlessly, expressing the same opinions in different ways. Overall, a boring read."
3,Wanted more examples of how to do it right.,Okay it scared me as a reader but where were the examples of what to do to make it right? Don't just give us the raw data and feel of the nation re: parenting....give us hope and tell us how to do it better.
5,GREAT COLLECTION BUT HE'S BETTER NOW THAN EVER,"THIS IS A GREAT ADDITION TO MY DYLAN COLLECTION, BUT I WITH THIS CD AND MARTIN SCORSESE FILM, I HOPE THAT BOB IS NOT JUST CONSIDERED A '60'S ICON AND BLAST FROM THE PAST. AFTER HEARING ABOUT 40 COMPLETE SHOWS FROM HIS MARCH-JULY 2005 TOUR, HIS CURRENT TOURING GROUP WITH THREE FINE GUITARISTS AND A KILLER RHYTHM SECTION PROVIDE, IN MANY CASES, STRONGER VERSIONS OF THESE FAMILIAR SONGS FROM HIS ""GLORY"" DAYS FEATURED ON THIS COLLECTION. HIS MOST RECENT ALBUM, 2001'S LOVE AND THEFT STANDS ALONG SIDE HIS VERY BEST WORK. THAT HE'S PERFORMING AT AN ARTISTIC PEAK IN 2005,AT AGE 64, IS AN EVEN MORE INTERESTING STORY , IN SOME WAYS, THAN RETELLING HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE '60'S."
2,Columbia blows it,"Columbia blew it last year by releasing that 1964 Philharmonic Hall Concert as Volume 6 in The Bootleg Series when the success of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ would have made it an ideal time to release something truly rare, like Dylan's outstanding Toronto show from 1980 when he was absolutely on fire, praising the Lord in explosive live versions of the songs from ""Slow Train Coming"" and ""Saved,"" as well as some never recorded material.I was really hoping they'd put THAT out this year. Instead we get this ""soundtrack"" to the Martin Scorsese documentary. I'm sure that will be good, even great, but this CD, though filled with excellent music, doesn't offer much of anything new. There's nothing here that's going to startle the ear unless you've never heard Dylan before. Like another reviewer said, this set seems recycled. With so music that's never been heard still gathering dust in the vaults, does anyone really need yet another version of ""Mr. Tambourine Man""?"
3,This is not the soundtrack..,"I clicked on Mr. Tamborine Man, quite expecting to hear the whimsical, amazing version on the DVD from the Newport festival, where he sings alone surrounded by folkies, occassionally interrupted by some annoying guy lamenting the protest songs, and I get a rough duet with who? I click on Visions of Johanna, do i get the surreal version on the DVD, with Bob refusing to crash in the Hills of Tennessee, just wanting to go home (and crash on his motorcycle) with delicate refrains and moving poetic intonations and drifting harmonica.. no, just a studio electric version. Guess I'm supposed to get all the live bootlegs, ok. I am gratefull to , 'Don't Look back', having intoduced me to Dylan. Where is it?"
2,Not Worth The Extra Cost,"A pack of 32 Eveready AA's can be bought at Home Depot for less than $12. Sometimes they are as low as $10. I have not noticed that much longer a life for Duracell to speak of. At a 50-60% higher price, these are definately not a value on any level."
5,Rico sax reeds,These are one of the best reeds that you can buy. They a great reed to use and do not take a lot of breaking in. I have used this make before and they have lived up to what it says on the packet. So for me there was no choice.
4,"It's a good series, specially if you wait, and then buy when its around 15$","If you haven't seen the 1st season of this anime, i recommend you buy the 1st and 2nd season apart, I was unsure about buying, but after seeing the 1st season, it was worth it for sureat the price i got it at."
1,Not into the child porn aspect of this trash,Plenty of naked women and one underage girl that transforms into a woman after being kissed. The transformation is graphic and disturbing.
2,Limited functionality - Powerpoint users only need apply,"Although the specifications for this product can lead you to believe that you could use your Jornada as a regular laptop with up to 1024x768 resolution on a monitor, you will only get that when running a Pocket Powerpoint presentation. For anything else, what you get is an exact replication of your handheld's screen, in the same resolution (640x240). The latter mode presents itself on the screen as just taking the top half of your monitor's display area in VGA mode. This card is good only if you want to present Pocket Powerpoint slides, and if that is the case, it does a good job."
2,Poorly designed,"This is an adequate shirt for the money IF you are of average height. The shirt is too short in the front if you are over 6' or so tall. They apparently took the measurements for a tail-less shirt and reduced the front length thus leaving a tail.The shirt is prone to a small amount of shrinkage (like most cotton) even in cold water. Therefore sizing is particularly critical here.The Blake and Hollister (probably the same company) are generally better (except for the vertical rib shirt, which is way to small in length for the indicated size).Note that the positive reviews here may have been planted...none of the reviewers reviews anything but shirts from this company."
2,Unusual shrinkage in the first wash.,What do you expect for this low price? Used this only twice and now it's being used in the Garage. Unusual shrinkage in the first wash. Went from Large to Medium rendering it unusable! Buy size XL if you are intending to buy size L.
3,Cool shirt,"For that price, i am more than satisfied. Be aware that your collar might float at the points a little...no dates in this one."
1,An embarrassment,"Very poor. The nirvana songs are all recorded by ""sound alikes"". There is no information here that hasn't been offered on other sources for years. A biography of Kurt. How many of these already exist? His suicide note - available for years on the internet and other media. Overall disappointing and frustrating."
1,Disappointed,I bought this for my 4 year old & 20 month old to enjoy in the yard. We were very disappoited to find that it didn't do anything. It barely sprayed water - the water it did spray went straight down. I intend on returning it if the store I bought it from will take it back.
3,no TV?,"I wish I could write a review for this TV. I ordered it a month ago and the shipping company, Nationstreet, still hasn't delivered it! Save yourself some time and pick it up in a retail store! (I hear the TV is great!)"
1,Order not complete,Order was received not complete - shorted 5 boxes. No communication with order received. No phone number to contact custome service.
3,Its ok,"Just received the item ordered. It is as pictured and described. I gave the rating of 3 for the fact that the coaster holder does not sit completely level. 1 of its feet seems to be about 1/8 in shorter than the other three.This is not really an issue as its will sit holding the coasters that was ordered. But for those that feel this will be an issue, look for something else."
2,Crappy,These things are very cheaply made. The felt stickies at the buttom came off during shipment and they were a little bent up as well. They hold coaster like they are supposed to. WOW!
3,holder,"I don't know it looked great on the computer screen, I thought it came with the coasters (NOT), if I would have seen it in a store I would have walked past it. It's nice but that's it"
4,Take Note!,"This holder is very decorative and I like it much better than my other wooden Thirstystone holder, but beware of one thing, some of the thicker thirstystones (such as the herringbone pattern) will not fit properly. I can only fit 3 of the herringbone pattern coasters into this holder. I have older cinnabar coasters that are significantly thinner (not sure why) and they will fit fine. I don't know why the coasters are of different thicknesses, I just know that they are."
2,Failed to prove his point,"As a native of Massachusetts (and world traveler), I expected to learn the opposite of what New Englanders learn in high school: how California changed us. Schwartz left that point behind after penning his title.I agree with other reviewers that his grasp of history (pre-WWII) was good - I learned a ton about the early settlement and development, and that has enriched my travels here. I also agree that his rant about communism was too much. But there were other problems - the book turned into a SF-Chronicle vs LA argument, for one. Also, by concentrating so much on CA history, Schwartz forgot to say how it traveled east. And I thought I was going to learn that. He avoids Hollywood cultural history too much (the part that does not pertain to Communism), when that would have been vital in proving his entire point.I could go on, but will close by saying that the book is worth reading until it gets to the year 1918. Just tear out the rest."
1,A Communist Behind Every Palm Tree,"This is an incredibly silly book. I picked it up hoping it had potential, because it seemed to want to delve into the interesting topic of --without irony-- California intellectual history.Instead, Schwartz uses this book an a opportunity to expose almost everyone halfway progressive in the state as either a Communist, a Stalinist, or both. The funniest laugh I got was when Schwartz refers to 'The Grapes of Wrath"" movie as a failure compared to the book-- and that no one watches the movie any more (!)-- but then goes on to cite Ma Joad's sentimental ending speech about ""the people"" as a prime example of Commie influence in Hollywood.Only one problem-- that speech was proudly written by-- get this-- that great fellow traveler, DARRYL F. ZANUCK!!! It was one of his proudest career boasts. Schwartz makes total fool of himself on this point alone. An unreliable, silly screed. Not recommended."
5,Finally...,"I can't believe how many fans there are of this movie! What a self-esteem boost!It's great that so many people ""get it"". Thanks, everyone, for watching - but thanks MORE for laughing."
1,Quality of the CD,"I ordered two CD's by Luis Salinas from Amazon.com I chose a vendor that is a subcontractor to Amazon and the shipment was a little slow.The CD by Salinas ""Ahi Va"" was defective and simply would not play at all. The other CD played just fine. I need a replacement.This is the first time I have received defective merchandise. Previous shipments were just fine."
3,Great mixed with the mediocre mixed with the horrible,"Bought this CD today. Best tracks:8. Self Esteem - This song was slowed down, done nicely. Punk purists need not apply, but if you want it done punk, be satisfied with the original version. Kuma's version is something nice to relax to - except perhaps for the ""when she's saying"" part.9. Feelngs - I can't believe that an Offspring song was done as an R&B;/rap cover and I generally hate that stuff but I can't not like this one. Excellent.12. The Kids Aren't Alright - another good one. Again, slowed down, mellowed out."
3,"Of its time,but...","Steve and John Hackett were members of Quite World, and that is the reason I bought the cd.I'm a bit of a old school Genesis freak and realy didn't think I'd spin this more than once a year thankfuly this is not the case.It is a great Moody Blues meet The Stawbs kinda hybrid music with a slightly christan bent concept album about birth and death with some spoken word peppered in.Steve is featured and has afew moments that sound like his work in Genesis.although Quite World have no other records I would recomend this work as something worthwhile."
3,Not their best but still a few good songs,"I had this album when it first came out and listened to it quite a bit. Despite the mediocrity of many of the tunes, the album nevertheless still shows what excellent musicians and vocalists Chicago was back then (and still today). The main thing missing between back then and now is Peter Cetera's excellent vocals and Danny Seraphine's excellent drumming."
3,Disco Chicago,"I was never a big fan of Disco outside of hearing it in a club setting. And Chicago never came to mind when making a dance request(unless it was a slow dance to ""Colour My World""). The band was possibly trying to stay contemporary in the wake of declining popularity. Even though the stigma of Disco taints the album somewhat, ""Window Dreamin'"", ""Street Player"" ,""Life is What it Is"", ""Reruns"" and ""Loser With a Broken Heart"" are all listenable to some degree if you're a diehard Chicago fan (as I am)."
5,Chicago Fan,"Like most of Chicago's works, some of their best music was not released as singles. There are several songs on this CD that fall into the excellent, but not single worthy category. If you like Chicago, you will like this album."
1,Chicago 13 a stinker - an indicator for next 30 years,"Anyone with CTA, II, III, V, VI, VII must have wondered what on earth this disco dross was ? 30 years on it remains a stinker, BUT the band followed this AOR/ballad route so I left them. Much like Robert Lamm, who ceased writing songs by this time for the band."
1,"Long, tiring, and so not worth it...","I picked this up thinking it would be a good mystery. Instead, it was way too verbose and the storyline was awful. There's just too much description for parts, and I found myself skipping ahead (not missing much!).Too much bs about the paper, and not enough on the bomber plot. Only at the end does it pick up. The soloquy from the bomber is TOO LONG!!!Skip it, life's too short!!"
4,Good Information but too much of it.,"While I enjoyed reading this book, there was way too much information as to what each hydrosol, etc does. All the same information can be found on the websites recommended in the back of the book."
3,Animal Healing and Vibrational Medicine,I had hoped to find more on helping my itchy and allergic bulldog but there is only one chapter on dogs. I needed more help than I got from this source.
2,disapointed,"I found I was disappointed in the book. Put very few post-it note tabs on the books. Perhaps I expected more from it.I found the book ""Animal Healing with Australian Bush Flower Essences"" much more useful for use of a vibrational medicine with a practical emotional and physical repertory in it.Louise"
1,Hatchet Job...;,"I'm not particularly a Gore supporter but in my opinion this is a ""hatchet job,"" done with a dull, rusty hatchet. Not worth the read; surely not worth the price. I give it one star only because there is no provision for giving it none...or ""negative"" stars. I'm sorry I bought this, didn't check it out of the library, wasted the money."
1,Skip it.,"I always relish reading a biography of insight and wit with a keen eye for what is relevant and significant- that which reveals not only facts but innovatively deduces motivations.Unfortunately, this is not such a book. Zelnick's writing is pale and his research is weak. He has not discovered his subject anew, as they say. He seems content to diminish what potentially could be a memorable biography with National-Enquirer glibness. His book is replete with unwarranted speculation and he lacks the discipline of an objective journalist. I think the book is compromised by the fact that the reader has to contend with the author's personal political agenda.I truly do not think there has been a first-rate biography of Gore written yet. He may be someone that we will all have a better idea about once history gives us some perspective. We shall see."
1,Re-hash for Cash,"As a reporter who has covered Al Gore for more than a decade for a Tennessee newspaper, I can tell you that Zelnick has uncovered little that has not already been reported by somebody. Zelnick is best when he sticks to stuff he knows about, like defense and foreign policy. His interpretation of Gore on other subjects is often stunningly in error. And the book is filled with simple errors of fact and misspelled names. Much of the book reads like press releases from the Republican National Committee. There's at least one other book in the works on Gore _ not by me _ and I'd wait until it arrives."
1,Zelnick quit his job for THIS?,"with this a dreadful hatchet job, zelnich ruins his reputation, which he built over many years at ABC, as a smart political analyst.don't think this book was a rush job? then why is dick gephart described as former speaker of the house? hello! why is PA. senator harris wofford morphed into ""harrison"" and why is al d'amato's name misspelled?just a total mess. should be required reading at journalism shcool so students know how they DON'T want their careers to end."
2,Bob Zelnick is definitely No Bob Woodward,"This book was a clear dissappointment. Mr. Zelnick does not give us any more of an understanding of Al Gore that any of us could have gotten from researching Mr. Gore's public statements and positions. There is not even an ATTEMPT to uncover any ""behind the scenes"" conversations or the background for decisions. A very uninformative book and Mr. Zelnick puts way too much of his own opinion into the analysis (superficial that it is) of Mr. Gore the politician."
4,"Quotable, Simple, and helpful at reminding us GOD IS HERE!","Steve Case takes the classic of Brother Lawrence and The Practice of the Presence of God and remixes it to a new tune.One of emerging themes of Christian literature is the remix of ""classics."" The fear is that the depth of meaning and message is lost in the updated version. Case does not allow this to happen with Brother Lawrence, in fact his last chapter on Gathered Thoughts (prayer) is a wonderfully presented way of approaching prayer throughout the day - giving simple examples and offering challenging questions regarding what to pray for. Without becoming trite, Steve Case offers simple applications, thoughts, and questions that I till carry with me, quote, and meditate on.If you are looking for a fresh perspective on how you may increase the presence and focus with God, this is the book for you!"
3,I bought it because of the cover.,"The cover is sick and I am a nerd for good product design/typography. As far as the material of the book, I would have rather simply read Brother Lawrence's ""Practicing the Presence of God"" in its entirety than this guy's rendition. Not that the book is bad, but I simply did not need interpretation and notes on various elements of Lawrence's work when in my opinion it is already fully understandable. 5 star's for the cover design, however."
4,Modern Update of a Beloved Classic,"I love the way Steve Case quotes Brother Lawrence, and then uses modern terminology and examples to bring these beloved words to life for this generation. I have quoted this book to several people already, and I believe it will be a regular part of my devotional life for many years to come."
1,None,i read this book.I read it in fith grade and my mom said that it was awesome so stills reads it.
2,I was expecting so much more....,"The Naked Earl simply does not live up to it's press or promise. Both the title and jacket description alluded to so much more than what was delivered within the pages. The Naked Earl left me cold and wondering if those who write those glowing ""must read..."" jacket comments actually read the book. It seemed to me as if the sex scenes were written first and then a plot was loosely weaved around those scenes. While the first few pages were indeed captivating, the rest of the book dragged on. I kept reading, hoping that the magic of those first few pages would reappear. I was sadly disappointed."
2,The Naked Earl Is a Dont...,The Naked Earl has all of the literary elements you look for when you are purchasing a book. It has an interesting storyline and creative characters.The story starts off strong with the promised earl naked inside the lead character's bedrooom and then proceeds to go down hill. I had to make myself finish this book. I skimmed through several passages and eventually skipped a couple of pages just to finish reading this book. The author's characters and plot stagnant and come to a complete crawl after the first few chapters. The book has its moments but does not fit within the historical fiction genre. Some of the events are unrealistic. Robbie and Lizzie the main characters are tiresome. Without some of the secondary characters I probably would not have finished the book at all.
5,They just get better and better - Great Book,"'The Naked Earl' by Sally MacKenzie is a historical romance novel with some great twists. Earl of Westbrooke leaps out of his bed when he finds a naked women trying to trap him into marriage. He runs out of his room and finds himself in Lady Elizabeth's room naked - that's just the beginning of an interesting house party. Lots of secondary plots that heat up the pages. Check out all her books; The Naked Duke, The Naked Marquis and The Naked Gentleman (coming soon)"
1,Disgusting,"An entertaining premise quickly lost in a story about conniving secondary characters and perverted sex scenes. Why was innocent Lizzie even at this party? On second thought, why was anyone at this party where the characters did not have anything in common and did not like each other? I did not see any humor in the hero's ""problem"" or the giggly terms used to describe it. There was no romance in this story. I tossed it in the trash can."
3,"Great, but not SO great.","Very entertaining at most parts, funny and cheerful, but the plot seemed a little stupid. Come on, he couldn't fall in love with her because he thought he couldn't have kids, because he was a moron? He didn't even try to be friendly with her, so tipicle, ""wait till the VERY end before they finally fall in love and have sex."" Other than that it was very humorous and kinda cute. You just expect more out of the maim characters."
1,"My Spanish Teachers, boring book!","This is my Spanish teachers book. Though I have not read it I'm sure it is bad. He is a decent teacher and got mark krier in trouble. Bad, Bad Sagarin."
1,Did not work as advertised,"I was overall disappointed with this product, did not see the results and I used it as the label stated. Ended up having to buy another product"
5,awesome shampoo,I love this shampoo. My dog had demodex mange and this is the only product I used and worked perfectly. The dog was perfect in 2 weeks. I recommend to try this option for this particular problem before any oral medication.
5,We are happy with the results....,"My son told me about this product ....as my puppy was bitting and lossing her hair in several places along with constant scratching. Following it's instructions, we bath her three times a week and in two weeks time, she was growing her hair back and the scratching and bitting has stopped. I will always keep a bottle around....thanks."
5,Simple language and excellent analogies !,"Swami Chinmayanda has this great gift of explaining complex concepts using simple analogies. His clarity of thought was amazing. I read this book every week in order to ""burn"" the concepts into my brain. It has given me amazing peace of mind. This book has been the most influential book in my life and I would urge everyone to give it a shot."
4,Great for the imagination,"This toy is great for young children's imaginations and creativity. The story book is short and simple, perhaps by too much, but I guess that leaves more room for imaginary play. The pieces seem to be durable and my five year old has no difficulty putting the pieces together. She really enjoys making new animal creations out of them. The pieces are, however, tough for a just-turned-3 year old to put together. She still enjoys playing with the creations once they have been assembled.Overall, this toy provides a lot of creative fun for kids."
5,Whether travelling over land or in your head...,"...this collection just works. That's all there is to it. With a superior collaborative effort from a range of authors who, each and every one, never fail to tittilate, this book deserves space on any shelf. I've identified with many of the stories, and savored all of them. This book has been and will continue to be a favored companion on all my travels, and I can't urge you strongly enough to pick it up yourself and sample what it can offer."
1,Dull and predictable,"The editors seem to have confused ""bisexual"" with poly and threesomes, which shows a certain lack of imagination - that's every middle-aged white guy's ""bisexual"" fantasy, two girls and a guy. I'm afraid I found almost all of these stories either predictable and dull or else unreadable from the first page."
1,True Justice is Neither,"What do you get when you are a lawyer who has lost a high profile case and then decides to write a tirade against the ""idiots"" who put his defendant in that position in the first place (the state, the prosecution, the police, but never the defendent), and then try to change some of the tirade to include some dialogue? You get Tanenbaum's newest book, True Justice. The story of infant deaths in New York and Delaware (low and behold, Tanenbaum's lost real world case was in Delaware), too-young and too-stupid mothers, and the complacency of the law. Well what we have here folks is something to not waste your money on. Buy something else. His characters are two-dimensional, his plot (oh, you need a plot) thin, his dialogue unrealistic. His characters are all cynics and only think of the political side of their jobs. Get real, this is just an excuse for why he lost his case, and he expects us to pay for it."
3,True Justice truly entertaining......,"I found this book to be not only entertaining but thought provoking as well. In the begining at the mention of infanticides I wanted no mercy and did not understand the mercy with which Butch and Marlene viewed these incidences. However by the end of the book though not quite as liberal as these two on the subject I did feel there were two sides to the story. I like the development of Lucy and it's good to have Marlene back in the courtroom. I don't want to give anything away as to plot so let me just say the reaction to the killer at the end seemed unbelieveable to me. But this is a minor criticism. If you have not read this series I would start at the begining, you will appreciate the characters all the more. I too feel it is refreshing to have a married couple, with kids who are not portrayed as boring or imbeciles! <ree-views>"
3,"Smart, Intelligent..but kinda boring.","Smart, intelligent, and well written, but wasn't a page turner. It bogged down many times, and the ending just wrapped itself up way to neatly and quickly. I'd actually give it 21/2 stars, but it had it's shining moments."
3,A letdown,"I have read all the previous Karp series and found them to be real ""page turners"". True Justice had too much philosophy and not enough action for me. There were many boring pages scattered through the book promoting gun control and abortion, and agonizing over the unfairness of prosecuting minorities and drug users for the crimes they commit. If these lapses had been woven into the plot a little better I could have stomached them, but they seemed to me like disconnected stand alone lectures which the author dropped into the middle of the main story."
5,Read It NOW,"I have read every Robert Tanenbaum novel and True Justice was everything that I enjoyed in his previous novels: the complexities of morality, religion, right and wrong, violence, and the expectations of society and ourselves. Tanenbaum's last two novels have been slightly disappointing, but this one makes up for it! Lucy is a real piece of work and I was glad that Tran was still slightly in the picture for her. I always thought Tanenbaum saw himself in Butch, so knowing that he was the ""real-life"" attorney for ""Sarah"", it was very interesting to see his experience reflected through Marlene instead of Butch. He managed this with great flair, blending legal strategy with the feminine attention to emotions and still kept all of the character of Marlene that keeps me coming back for more. I can't wait until Enemy Within hits paperback."
5,Definitely a good book,"I read a lot, varied authors, topics and genres. This is one of the better books I've read recently. This was my third Tanenbaum (I read ""Hoax"" and ""Fury"" first). I passed each along to my mother, but recommended this one first.Overall, the storylines aren't bad, but the ever growing tensions in the Karp/Ciampi household got a little frustrating not too far into the book. I also wasn't impressed with the ""twist"" on who killed Lucy's friend's parents. Personally, I called it within two pages of reading about the murder. Perhaps it's because my mind won't fall to the obvious answer...if it's too obvious, it's probably not the right answer.I have every intention of reading the rest of Tanenbaum's books. I generally like the style and flow of the storylines. I enjoyed this book, just a little disappointment with the conclusion to the murder."
3,Guitar is very cheap - priced right respectively,Haven't had a chance to tune it yet. A friend is going to do it for us. Hopefully he can after all the reviews I read saying it couldn't be tuned. My 12 year old is anxious to try it out. This is just a starter guitar to see if she'll really be committed to playing it.
2,fast shipping but bad product,"I'm a student so I just needed a cheap guitar. Then I found this product and I was so happy to find a such guitar so cheap, but I shoud have gotten something at least over $50 because this guitar is a toy.. If I change te strings then maybe the sound will get better but right now it's so bad. The shipping was really fast. I got this guitar 3 days after I ordered it. I suggest you to consider buying a guitar that's at least over $50."
1,Do NOT buy this guitar!,"This guitar is horrible! It feels and sounds like a toy. Seriously, if you plan on learning the guitar, mind as well invest 30 more dollars and get a better brand name guitar. I'm not going to tell you which, but you can find many here on Amazon.com. Make your first experience a good one. After the first few seconds of strumming this guitar, I lost all of my motivation of learning it. Don't allow this to happen to you.I didn't want to give this guitar to someone who was trying to learn it because that would be very cruel of me. I didn't want to throw it away because I'd be wasting money. So guess what? I donated it to my theater art class at my high school so they can use it as a prop.Anyway, I don't understand how people are giving this guitar 3 stars or higher. In my book, I think it deserves a fraction of a star.-Mike"
1,Badly manufactured,The nut was glued to the guitar...badly glued. It wasn't really attached. I couldn't play it even once before it broke. :(
1,GARBAGE,"Terrible condition, the strings were so bad my tuner could not recognize them, the guitar itself had a terrible paint job, the strings were garbage, the overall construction was weak at best, it came with a broken string, it is too small and feels like a toy, if you are someone who knows anything about guitars at all DO NOT BUY THIS GUITAR. if you have a five year old kid who needs a toy to throw around however this is the TOY you want, because it surely cannot be called a musical instrument"
1,do not buy this guitar!!,"this is a horribly made guitar. I got it and paint was smeared, the zippers on the bag were busted and there were multiple chips and dents in the guitar. It looked as if someone bought it and painted over it with children's paint. I do not recommend this guitar the least bit!!Do not buy this guitar!!!"
3,hurry up pls,"Jasmine by Takamine S35 Acoustic Guitar, Naturalhurry up pls,cuz alredy i cant wait.i bought my guitar 5 day ago."
5,Excellent reading on the founder of Wahhabisim,"This book is a must read for anyone unaware of the movement of Wahhabisim and desire to know more about the origins of this movement. Hamid Algar (author) gives a very concise background of Muhammad B. Abd al-Wahhab (founder of Wahhabisim) as well as the relationship between the Saudi Family & Muhammad B. Abd al-Wahhab. The book contains the many plots and turmoil that resulted from this relationship and extensive references for readers whom would like to do further reading on the events revolving around the birth/growth of Wahhabisim.I also recommend the book: Wahhabisim by Ja'far Subhani, which refutes the Wahhabi's arguments regarding things which are 'shirk'."
3,Interesting,"I had some difficulty reading this work due to the extensive use of Arabic terms. The terms are indeed the best to describe the concepts they convey however for the uninitiated it can make understanding aspect of the essay a bit treacherous. Also the key word in the title is ""Critical"". All in all this is an interesting book."
1,Withdraw previous review,"I would like to withdraw the review I submitted earlier today. Upon mature reflection, I think I was too harsh."
5,A bright gem,"This book is a bright gem sparkling with the true light of Islam in the darkness. It carefully and conscientiously makes the case, so obvious to orthodox and normal muslims, that the Wahabbis ""have seriously distorted fundamental teachings of Islam"" ""vilified Muslims, both Sunni and Shi'i, as non-Muslim and shed their blood; introduced or exacerbated division and strife wherever they have gone"" and ""destroyed a significant part of the cultural patrimony of all Muslims"" p 69. This last point is a reference to the destruction of homes and tombs of the saints of Islam, and if Sheikh Kabbani of the Naqshbandi Order is to be believed, continues with the current destruction of the home the Prophet Muhammad was born in to make way for a royal Saudi library. A caveat: this book is written for Muslims, so if the terms bid'a, shirk, tauhid, 'ulama or Haramayn are unfamiliar, be prepared for a bit of study, or at least have a good introduction to Islam handy."
3,Snapshot of a religious movement over time,"The small size of this book fools the prospective readers into thinking that it is going to cover a very small patch of ground, when in reality it whisks one from the origins of the Wahhabi movement all the way to present day Saudi Arabia. This is considered a must in understanding the Wahhabi perspective, as well as a quick fact book that moves at a very fast clip, largely due to the writer's subject-matter expertise."
5,good understanding of Wahhabist thought,"A good short read for understanging the difference between the Wahhabist sect and the rest of the Islamic world. All the Arabic words and names slow the reader down quite a bit if you don't speak at least some Arabic, but this is unavoidable."
1,Unjustified Review,"To begin with, I'll let you know that I'm neither pro-wahhabism nor anti-shi'ism, but this book, written by a shia writer, criticizes wahhabism from a shia point of view. What I'm saying is that this would have been a much better book if the writer had written the book from a neutral view and left it for the reader to decide what is wrong and what is write."
1,"Obvious bias, for the knowledgeable only","I found this of no value to the average person seeking a knowledge of Wahhabism, so important to current events. One would have to have a graduate student's knowledge of Islam and its various schools of thought to get much from it. In addition, the author obviously has a very dull axe to grind when he discounts the teachings because of the area of origin of al-Wahhab: ""Najd had not been notable in Islamic tradition for scholarship or movements of spiritual renewal..."" and ""However, its occurance in the hadith literature does convey a sense of foreboding with respect to this part of the Arabian peninsula and suggest that any movement originating there should be viewed with great caution."" Chaper II, pages 5 and 6. One is reminded of the disparagement of Christ because of his place of origin in Matthew 13:55-56."
1,I would pass on these,"The bits rusted quickly, and the drill bits spin inside their hex base; completely unacceptable for Makita products at this price."
4,good item,"The fitness bar is a good little workout tool. I use it more to warm up my muscles than for strength training, but it works fine as a primary fitness device. It is especially good at working the biceps, triceps, back, shoulders, abs, and chest.It is very well built. The body is made of solid plastic with brass rollers. the rubber bands are very solid too. I expect it will give many years of good use."
2,Not a good buy,I bought this item along with a bullworker and a steel bow as Amazon had a price for all three and I thought it would not do any harm to try it out.It is cumbersome and not anywhere as effective as the bullworker or steel bow.The only good feature is that I can see that it would give your abdominal muscles a good work out. But not the obliques.So no I would not recommend it over all.
4,Not Bad If You Know How To Use It,"I have had this exercise device for a little over a week now. Its great if you know how to use it as it comes with no instructions. Fortunately you can find out how to use it on you tube. If it had instructions I would rate this 5 stars as it arrived a day sooner than expected and following the routines that I found on you tube my muscles have become strong and tight. I can literally feel strength and power in my hands, my arms, my chest and my shoulders. You can scarcely hurt yourself with this device as you control how much pressure you use on each exercise. This device WILL make you sore. Overall, great product, just wish it had instructions instead of having to look up routines on you tube."
1,"Cliffs Notes, NOT HELPFULL!","I am reading this book as apart of a US History project in school. I needed some extra help geting some of the details down, so I bought the cliff notes. What a waist of time and money! I would have much rather of read the book twice!"
1,"Do your research, please!","I am continually surprised that this food is rated as one of the best out there. Look at the ingredients. Cats are obligate carnivores, they require meat, not corn, not wheat, not brewer's rice, not ""powdered cellulose"" or ""soybean mill run."" None of the rest of these awful ingredients. Where is the meat in this food?Please do your research & investigate the ingredients in any pet food you plan to purchase. Your pet's health depends on your knowledge!"
4,A different kind of Herbert book,"Having previously read books such as ""The Fog"", ""The Rats"" and ""The Dark"" by Herbert, I found this book to be very different from the type of storie he has written in the past. The other books focuses on gore, violence and mass-destruction, whereas Moon tended to be more syspence-and-mystery type horror.Jonathan Childes is a physic who helps the police investigate matters such as child murder. When he is called to an island to investigate strange goings on he witnesses a series of brutal murders, and shares a frightening psychic connection to the killer.Good story when kept me gripped and had a good ending."
4,Lots of tension,"There are some great tense scenes in this book. But they're mostly near the beginning. I agree with a previous reviewer that the ending is a bit disappointing. Still, this book is well worth reading. His novel ""Others"" is also good."
4,does its job,This little handy dandy tool is a great asset to my low voltage bag I use it almost everyday in the trade for a quick check of wire map I have many testing tools and for the money this one does what the high dollar ones do except for saving results for print verification I would recommend it
4,Fluke,Fluke is a very high quality insturment company. The pricing we found through AMAZON was very attractive. The good prici8ng allowed us to increase our profit as we do resale nationwide. I would highly recomed anyone looking for these type insturments to try AMAZON before anywhere else.
1,stay away,"A pretty crummy book for the price. It's pretty short, the explanations aren't very good, and I don't particularly like the chosen topics either. You'd be better off with Kittel, and Kittel is a terrible book. I've read this, Kittel, Omar, Ashcroft+Mermin, and Burns, and this is the worst. It doesn't tell you enough to build a foundation for anything and I didn't find a single person in my class of 12 or so who liked this book. How bad is this book? I had to write my own table of physical constants on the inside cover because this book doesn't have them. I'd buy Omar instead, followed by Kittel, followed by anything else but Bube."
3,Too little too late,"Faith and Politics: How the ""Moral Values"" Debate Divides America and How to Move Forward TogetherThis is a book where the author is personally appealing, confessional, and transparant in his thinking. It is a book that reveals clearly some presuppositional errors in the author's thinking, either adopting a pendulum swing thought about his party or maintaining brand loyalty to his party above commitment to his own beliefs. The Terry Schiavo event seemed to be the concern that sounded the alarm for Danforth that the religious right had taken over the GOP, and this was no longer the party of Eisnehaur,Rockefeller and Gerald Ford. Sadly this is a man whose house was washed away in a flood and he thought he was surfing a wave. I say this with some sympathy, as I grew up in a mom rooted in Danforth's political approach, but I discovered its demise twenty years ago, about the time Danforth was riding his self-confessed expediency."
4,Most Christian's Don't Get It,"This book affirms what I have been saying for some time, the Christianity that is promoted is not true Christianity but false hypocrisy. While the book is more diplomatic about saying this, the book still gets the message across.In the Midwest Christianity is used as an excuse to paddle children and love war. We must strive to take the hate out of Christianity.By Christian Peper"
1,Like an auto mechanic discussing nuclear physics,"Although Mr. Danforth may be an ordained minister it is obvious he is of the ""unsaved"" variety. Basically we wants the religious right to compromise their values to get along. Compromising values is what makes values worthless. A wishy-washy liberal mainstream protestant but obviously a politician first. The liberal elite will praise this book."
4,Danforth: a good and quick read.,"I found the book an easy and enjoyable read. I purchased the book mainly to get a better grasp of Dansforth's opinion on stem-cell research (he supports it), a troubling topic for many of us who struggle with aligning our values for all stages of life with that of the rapid advancements in medical science. He gave a compassioned and reasoned discussion that left me with some things to gnaw on--good food for thought. The book is not solely about stem-cell research (only one chapter is devoted to the topic), but about many faith-based issues that collide with the politics of today. What he writes for the most part would seem obvious and few would overly disagree with his message, but it is not what you hear in today's media. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the interdependent issues of politics and morality, or just want to hear a more congenial voice on today's pressing political issues."
1,whining like a little girl,"Danforth--the main religious engineer behind the confirmation of our KitKat Supreme Court justice who puts ""natural law"" above the Consititution--is back to tell us that no matter how long the Republican Party is in total control of every lever of power, they shouldn't be held responsible for anything, ever. Now it's Jerry Falwell. Somehow it's always ""their"" fault, and the ""thems"" are the commies, no it's the hippies, no it's the liberals, no it's the media, no it's Hollywood.If Danforth is looking for someone to blame for the politics of smear and disinformation he might want to look into the careers of Lee Atwater and his alterboy Karl Rove. Bottom line: fatuous finger pointing in hopes of avoiding another 40 years on the sidelines starting in 2006 to avoid the bill for the mess the Republican Party has made of everything they've touched. Weasel."
1,planning lds weddings and receptions,it gave a few good ideas but i think it was really out dated.i think there are going to be more books out there that are up to date.
2,Much Ado About Too Little,"Largely pointless and unconscionably tedious. Sure to be a huge disappointment for admirers of Long's exquisite, gem-like ""The Falling Boy."""
3,A new approach,"A cross between Agatha Christie & Harlequin? I am an aficionda of mysteries & true crime but not romantic fluff. Through links here on Amazon.com and other sources of reviews, I see lots of books that look interesting. Some I purchase, some I order from the local library system. By the time this book arrived at the library, I didn't remember what it was about or why I'd ordered it. I tried something different: I didn't read the jacket or other preliminaries before commencing the book.This book is more ""romantic literature"" than crime mystery - but it did keep me turning the pages to find out what happened to Carly. I did tire of page after page after page of soliloqual exposition a la John Galt (it worked when Ayn Rand had Galt do it - but not effectively here.)"
2,A Difficult Pill to Swallow,"This book was compelling enough to devour in one sitting. The tragic story of what took place after Carly's disappearance, along with a desire to find out what happened to her, definitely keeps the reader turning pages. Where I thought the story fell apart was in the end. The notion that Fanning could solve the case by interviewing a few people, people who, coincidentally, neither the police nor the family's private detective thought to speak with during the routine background investigation that would accompany this kid of case, is ludicrous."
1,To Kill the Pope,"This book is virtually unreadable. The author's frequent factual mistakes cast doubt on his research. By page 80, the author had Blackhawk helicopters flying in the Vietnam War and Cardinal John O'Conner being discussed as Cardinal O'Conner in 1972 when he didn't become the Archbishop of New York until the mid eighties. Additionally, the premise of a French Pope attacked by a Polish assassin as the fictional treatment of the attempt on John Paul II completely lacked credibility. And the characterization was stereotypical and unbelieveable. I couldn't get beyond page 80."
2,Doesn't fit my Etrex Vista HCx,"Unfortunately, my own experience with this product is similar to C. Neblett's (see earlier review). It was very difficult to put my Etrex Vista HCx into this holster and still more difficult to pull it out: I had to use both hands and even then it required a lot of strain.Other reviewers report no problems with this product and I assume they are telling the truth. I can only guess that the problem must be inconsistencies in the way the product is being manufactured with some of them turning out a little too small for some of the GPS receivers they are intended to hold. This is a shame because otherwise this holster appears to be well made, strong, and solid."
2,"Too Tight, Velcro Not Durable","If you're not prone to getting dirty, and aren't particularly hard on your gear, this is a ""fine"" holster. Quick retrieval of your eTrex will usually end up tearing the holster off your belt (and ruining your belt) repeatedly, as it's too snug for the eTex and the beltclip has no backgrip. The velcro fastener is easy to gum up by falling in a stream or a bit of mud/dirt, and then it's just flapping around useless- which then you ""understand"" why the holster keeps a death grip on your eTrex."
5,LOVE THIS PLASMA UNIT,"i've looked every where online for a new plasma stand. i currently own ikea tv stand and its extremely low. i've owned a sanus euro series a/v stand and i found the flat panel pffp. i purchase this flat panel unit from ebay for $304. shipped. the unit arrived in a large heavy box. i had to get the concierge to help me move it up to my home. every thing was very well packed and nothing was broken when arrived. installation took me about 30-40 minutes, it was quite easy. to hardest part was hooking my 50"" plasma on the unit. its hard if your doing it yourself. this hook up requires two people to hang the plasma on the unit. overall, i love it. it makes my plasma look even BIGGER."
5,Excellent Product,"Well packaged, arrived without any damage. The pictures online do not give this product justice. Assembly was easy. Overall an excellent purchase experience."
2,NO!,"Just buy Calle 13 Explicit Lyrics,this one erases almost most of the songs,every song has a bad word,and he uses one like from 10 seconds to another so youll be hearing the bleep tone almost everytime."
2,Does its job.,It's not the best option. The phone has to be perfectly placed on the counter and it cannot be touched because it will come off. Too flimsy but for now it is doing its job. I wouldn't purchase it again if I knew.
1,Does not fit Nokia N82 perfectly,This does not fit the N82 very well. It constantly slips out with very little pressure.iGo needs to produce a tip designed actually for these phones.
3,"scenic, but not terribly exciting","The scenery and buildings were beautiful and exotic. Beautifully filmed. Richard Burgi was very scenic as well (such a handsome actor!), but the plot did not do credit to the beauty of the location and the male and female leads, who I feel did their best with what they had to work with. Even with the high-quality eye-candy, the movie dragged. It just got boring."
3,Good product,"I love the game and this is a good product but since it this block only has 165 cards in it there are some repeats of some commons and none of the others, despite what statistics might predict."
4,Good Deal and great picture,This is an excellent unit at a good price...I wish there was more bass in the sound but other wise the unit is flawless and I live in NYC and priced this unit and it was $1049 at one of our big retailers.
4,"great #4, good #1. 4.5 stars","I chose to review this coupling rather than the Bohm Duo adding #s 2 and 5 to the mix. I find these good but somewhat heavy with Bohm less energized than I would like. His best Beethovens in this set, I believe, are #s 4,6, and 7 (an earlier KB#7 with the BPO is even better). #4 here finds Bohm at his best. It is quite beautiful-listen to the opening of the first movement and all of the second movement- but also propulsive and juiced (// Bohm's BPO Brahms Symphonies 1 and 2, not his VPO remakes). #1 is good but not great-cf Szell/Sony and Jochum/BPO and BRSO. Peers in #4: Jochum/RC0 and Szell/Cleveland/Sony+ an excellent Kubelik/BRSO version (MCD -064) which is livelier than his Audite version"
4,To my Son with Love,"It is difficult to find memory books for sons. I was pleased to find one here and it was in the condition as described. I was surprised that the format had changed from To my Daughter with Love. The daughter book asked me to list favourites. I expected the same here- favourite football team, hockey, etc. as well as favourite foods or favourites of his grandfathers. There is some listings here but I found them difficult to list: most inspirational figure or teacher in my son's life might not be the person I thought it was. Above all the book is a good method to organize my thoughts for my son to read at a much later date privately."
3,You got what you paid for,"It works and the installation is piece of cake (if you know how, the instructions on the package is quite puzzling). Under California sun, rubber deteriorates quite quickly (about 4 months usage). You got what you paid for."
1,&#65326;&#65327;&#65332;&#12288;&#65319;&#65327;&#65327;&#65316;,Poor quality&#65292;it wears out quickly. I dislike it. It just lasted limited time and I have to change to new ones. I would not buy this any more.
2,not compatible with Honda accor 2004,"I bought two blades a 26"" & an 18' for my honda accord EX 2004. I was written to be compatible but after I put them on they just don't lie flat against my windshield . The 5"" of the 26"" are off & the 2-3"" of the 18"" blade are off .the parts that lie flat on wipe pretty good other wise it's just annoying especially during rain ...."
1,disappointed with theses wipers,after one month of use they streak horribly. You get what you pay for. I would not recommend. I will be purchasing a pair of Rainx wipers.
3,Doesn't fit a '96 Jeep Cherokee,"I ordered these wipers because they were a great price and Amazon said they would fit my '96 Jeep Cherokee. The very first time I used them there was a constant squeaking sound similar to the sound wet shoes make on a hard surface; extremely distracting and annoying! A closer inspection revealed that the passenger side wiper was hovering over the windshield almost a 1/2 inch because the wiper wasn't conforming to the contour of the windshield. I tried manipulating the wiper to make it fit better with no luck. After a couple weeks I replace these wipers with Rain-X wipers, which is the brand I had before. I'll definitely be sticking with those in the future."
1,Works great for 10 months then streaks.,"These wipers work great for about 10 months, then streak badly. I bought these on Amazon so I looked up the date of purchace. I then looked on the Comsumer Report web site and found the same results....6 months to a year they start streaking. Comsumer Report also said the Rain - X Latitude wipers lasted longer. I'll try those next."
1,WIPER WAS BROKEN,The wiper broke in my hands while I tried to install it. Nothing was wrong with the packaging. The plastic part that broke was either weak or broken when I removed it from the packaging.
3,Wrong wiper..probably my fault,I was a bit disappointed that I only received one wiper and the wrong size for the front windshield. Must have misread the description...this wiper is for the rear window of a GMC Yukon. Have not put it on yet.
3,Not a Rain-X,"Bought this to go on the passenger side of my car since it's a bit cheaper than the Rain-X one I have on the driver's side. While it still does the job, I do notice streaks that I don't see on the driver's side. But if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the Rain-X brand this will certainly be useful for you."
2,Disappointing!,"The author got carried away with many of his metaphors and descriptions . . such as comparing cow pies to paper. Has he never seen a cow pie? The ending made no sense. A grandchild of Emily's husband who only appears on the last page of the book sums up her life? It appears that the author was at a loss for an ending and tried to wrap it up with something external to both of the protagonists, but it was transparently bogus. The book was an easy read, but it was a disappointing read."

4,good but easy,My daughter loves this series. She's a fourth grader and this was much too easy reading for her. Great book for child starting out with chapter books.
4,A Treasure Chest of Behavioral Strategies for Individuals with Autism,"Good resource book, more case studies then I thought."
5,"Easy to read, easy to understand, easy to put into use.","I recommend this book to parents and teachers alike - it is simply written, the methods are effective, and the techniques are grounded in ABA. As a BCBA, this is the book I share with parents and school systems. No one here will try to impress you with technical terms you don't understand; on the contrary, this book will give you tools, and simple explanations of why those tools work. In a nutshell, this book will be in your hands more than on the bookshelf, and you'll feel like you've finally found a resource you can actually use."
3,It's OK,The passport holder is OK. I was looking for something more upscale. It is doable. I ended up giving it to my mom.
1,Great Beginning - And All Downhill From There!,"It's always difficult to write a bad review when one realizes the weeks and months that must go into writing a novel. But this book is just a waste. The idea for the book is good and it begins well. A woman is been found dead and the hero recognizes the face of his old love when he sees a reconstruction of the face of the corpse. But from that point the author does not know where to go. The plot limps along with a lot of pointless conversations, little action, and badly described emotions. It is difficult to maintain interest in the characters. I wish I had not read this book and - if you buy it - you'll be sorry too."
3,The Darkness Tribute,"No one can sing like Justin Hawkins, and this album proves it. The first 4 tracks on this album are much heavier than the orginal versions. The song 'Givin' Up' doesn't even have the words Givin' Up in it, the chorus has new lyrics and the riff is completely different. But fear not, for the album features songs by the bands The Why Bothers and The UK Rock Brigade who's really doing a great job. As a bonus, you get a few songs that might have been in the LP collection of The Darkness themselves, but isn't this supposed to be a Tribute To The Darkness only?Anyway, if you really like The Darkness you're gonna buy this album.- Kos."
5,"Great Topper, Excellent price","I bought this topper to help make a firm mattress more comfortable. I shopped around, and everywhere I looked I couldn't find a King memory foam topper for under $100. Found this on amazon, ordered it, and I couldn't be happier. It did exactly what I expected and my bed is a lot more comfortable now."
3,Not holding up,I bought my mattress topper a month ago. Within a week it had already begun to sink where my bottom is when laying on the bed. I don't weigh much so I thought it would come back up but no it just kept going lower and lower. I thought it was a good topper from the other reviews I had read but guess not. Won't buy another one.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I knew when I was purchasing this that it wasn't going to be the VERY BEST quality because it is very inexpensive but what I received was a HORRIBLE product! The foam is very cheap, it is soooooo uncomfortable that I would literally be more comfortable laying on my floor with some blankets down. It is not worth the money at all, save your money and buy something a little more pricey because you get what you pay for!"
1,lost it's memory,"The only memory about this memory foam is that it remembers where we sleep on it, as is evident by the dips and large depressions in the foam. We bought it to add to our solid oak king size sleigh bed because we wanted a higher bed, and thought this would do the trick. This is nothing but cheap foam; that was our first impression when we opened it up, but we kept very open minds about it. However, by the end of our third month sleeping on it, every night we felt like we would roll into our 'hole' when we got into bed, then climb out of our hole in the morning. Our comforter looked horrible on it since the first thing you saw were those two deep depressions. So what we ended up with was a higher bed around the outside, but lower in the middle; it looked like an under-baked souffle! We finally took it off and I wish I could return it. Way too soft to sleep on, too; our backs started hurting in the morning."
2,Disappointed,"This wasn't what I thought it would be. I wanted something more Temperpedic like. However, they made my return very easy and refunded me promptly."
5,Sleep has never been easier.,"This was the best investment I have made in years. I have tested some of the store brand memory foam pads and compared to the selections, this one was the best one for the price. It has definitely changed the way I sleep and I have less neck and back pain."
4,"Aaah, I can sleep better!",Much less expensive than anything I found in store. It's pretty comfortable and that's all I care about. Even the dog and cat think it's wonderful!
4,better than expected,"I ordered this product based on other reviews it recieved. It was as good as they said. My only complaint, as was the same as I read, is that there is no cover on the pad. This makes it pretty warm. It retains your body heat. I put two sheets on it and that seemed to help. Overall this was a great pad for the price."
5,Great wipers,"I have been using the rainx wipers for a while now, and I can't stand them. Maybe it's just the curvature of my windshield (2005 honda civic), but they will always streak and leave water behind when wiping. These are priced fairly in my opinion, and work great. I can't give you a shelf life for them just yet, they are only a few weeks old, but so far they do the job. ...and at that price, they will be what I use on my vehicle from now on. Go ahead and get you a pair!"
4,"Decent wiper, good for the price.","Good wiper for the price. I had better blades, but cost 3-4 times as much, and they die out after a year too, so for most people, this wiper should be fine. Just be careful installing one of them, the installation bracket is a little flimsy and broke off when I was installing it. But otherwise, a good wiper for the price."
1,DOES NOT FIT BMW 325i (E46),Amazon got this one wrong. Their database says it's a fit so I bought them but the inserts do not have the pin necessary to lock the blade into the BMW arm; they will slide out. Go to the Federal-Mogul (Anco) site and check their database: they list no wipers whatsoever for this car.
4,Very good,"Very good wiper, and an excellent value when you consider the price. They wipe cleanly and streak-free. I will buy these again."
5,best wiper blades for the money.,"good blade for the money.it is not the best blade around but for this price, cant beat it, anywhere."
1,JUNK!! STAY AWAY!!!,"These wipers are garbage! The very next day after putting them on, the driver's side literally fell apart.I know these are economy wipers, but I expected to get a bit more out of them than 24 hours!They are made of cheap plastic pieces that are linked together haphazardly.My advice is spend a few more dollars and get the Rainx brand wipers, they are metal... EVEN the cheapo wipers at my local auto part store are metal and better made!"
5,It's MY story!,"I had to check to see who wrote this because it followed my own life in so many ways. I was an ""ambulance girl"" at an older age like Kathy Bates in this movie. I made the same dumb mistakes. When I first started as an EMT I did like she did, went to bed with my clothes on, just waiting for the radio to go off. It brought back so many memories, and was a great part of my life. Love it!!!"
4,I liked it,I like the story of a woman who has courage even in the face of the things she fears most. And it did a good job of showing the validity of quite different points of view. It's definitely for adults in relationship.
3,Good Flick,"I originally saw this movie on the Lifetime network. This is a good story with a good message. Kathleen Bates is superb. The acting was credible, the filming and editing were perfectly balanced. This has the potential to be a 'chick flick', however I think it has universal appeal."
3,not what I expected,"Bought this for my husband and the picture makes it look a lot bigger. It's not. It worked great for awhile, then he said it kind of lost it's tone."
4,Fun with goldfish,"Another of Satoshi Kitamura's quirky, fun books, featuring a cameo appearance by Boots the Cat (or could it be Nicholas?). My daughter thinks ""Me and My Cat"" is better, though."
1,Paints an unrealistic picture,"I was not impressed with this book. The images seemed so beautiful but the storyline was just awful. I am tired of hearing about how rude and savage and brutish the Vikings were. After also buying their other book about Vikings I learned that the authors are Christians and thus were writing from a perspective that pays tribute to this fallacy. If you are looking for something that will be truthful and try give an unbiased image of the discovery of America, this is not your book."
5,We looked forward to reading this book everyday.,Leif the Lucky was the first book of our American History curriculum and we fully enjoyed it. It brought many questions to our minds including what happened to the Viking race?
4,8 year old boy,"Leif the Lucky is about Leif Ericksson when he found ""Wineland"".Leif the Lucky is about Leif Ericksson and his adventures. Including one when he found ""Wineland"" America. He was given the name lucky when he found America. His father was named Erik the Red who went from Iceland to Greenland. Then Leif picked up and went to America. It is a good book."
5,Only belt I use!,"The Goodyear Gatorback belt is the ONLY belt I have ever discovered that stays completely silent on my car! For whatever reason, every other brand squeaked and squealed but the Gatorback stays quiet! It lasts a very long time as well with little to no wear after 3 years of use. Highly recommend this belt!"
5,Better than the Crappy OEM Toyota Belt.,I used this belt to replace the squeaky serpentine belt in my 2007 Corolla. This belt took care of the squeaking problem.
5,"Works great, good quality replacement belt","I have put these on three cars with the Toyota 1.8L engine to replace the OEM belts. One of the cars, a Corolla, had a severe squeal almost from the time it was new. Since installing this Goodyear, the belt is silent. Time will tell if the belt will hold up, but my sense is that it is a higher quality part than OE. I would recommend this if it's time for a belt change."
5,fantastic,"itemed recived super fast and packed well also replaced tensioner (Dayco 89356 Automatic Tensioner Assembly assembly) on 2005 corolla with 106,000 miles this was an easy diy repair! price was dirt cheap"
3,What on earth does canon make this thing out of...,"Silver? Gold? Platinum? Adamantium?The design is good, with locking knob, and mark to aline the lens to lens mount. But what a ridiculous price.Many of Canon's products Im very pleased with, but other times I'm not impressed. For example, the XTi is great, but don't even get me started with their .cr2 raw picture file format, which is impossible to open unless you have certain (and usually expensive) programs."
5,More medical than mental,"I don't review books that I don't like. This one was a bit too medical for my taste (I discovered that I generally crave a psychological take on depression) but it is a book everyone who feels depressed, or ill, should have as a reference. As a result of reading the book I started taking vitamins every day and felt instantly much better. I noticed that I have been concentrating on depression so much from the ""how-do-I-feel?"" point of view that I have just about ignored all the physical things that affect the mood. While the book was a bit dry to read, it gets the job done. I feel that now I have a whole view on depression and I can address it from all the angles."
2,Eh,"I'm sure there is helpful information to be had about how diet and supplements can affect your mood. However, in reading this book I felt a bit like I was being pitched by a snake-oil salesman. He provides all these symptom lists that would associate with various deficiencies, but they all basically include the same symptoms, most of which are just general symptoms of depression (not to mention lots of other conditions). So how are you tell definitively if you have a said deficiency? Also, his premise is that diet and supplements can help provide the pre-cursors of neurotransmitter prodcution, rather than increase neurotransmitter availability in the brain like meds do. But he never convinceingly lays out the research to support this theory. Maybe take this a starting point to go ask your doctor or nutritionist some questions, but it is certainly not a complete alternative to other treatments."
2,"..............so,so,although...............","Unbreakeable price,but the game itself dissapoints in it's limitations on play and design."
3,a mortal's perspective on endurance sport,"Using a casual tone, the author allows the non-elite athlete to vicariously live the ""what-if"" scenario we all think of -- what if I REALLY trained...? A good, casual read that offers no answers, but plenty to think about."
2,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"IF YOU BUY THIS ITEM BUY IT DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON TO INSURE THAT YOU ACTUALLY GET A BLUE ONE!!!!!BOUGHT ONE FROM RSGREATDEALS AND RCVD A PLAIN ONE WITH BROKEN STRINGS AND ONE SLIGHT MOVE AND THE HANDLE IS GOING TO COME OFF,IT LOOKS GLUED ON. BUY FROM ANOTHER SELLER OR DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON! GUITAR IS ALSO EXTREMLY SMALL, EVEN FOR A CHILD."
4,Not bad,"I found a few things I didn't like in this one, but if you are a Gene Stallings fan it's worth it. Bama fans would kill to have another coach like Stallings back at the helm. This book proves why. I recommend it highly along with ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"". Die hard football fans will love both. Especially SEC fans."
3,Very light duty,These are pretty cute and handy and get the job done but they seem very light weight and would not be a good investment if you're looking to use them for a while. I took my KitchenAid pro 600 stand mixer apart and needed this to remove exactly 3 retaining rings and will likely never use them again after this repair is done - so it's fine for the price and what I need it for.
4,Learning the techniques of breathing while working out.,"This DVD is a dat long, but what I really like about this DVD, it shows you how to breath and flatten your ABS while working out. Not only you learn some techniques, but it's good for your health as well.Like I said, it's a dat long, but when I do have a few extra minutes to spare and want to relax while working out, this is a Great DVD."
1,Biggest waste of time Ever!,"If you would like to watch over an hour of footage on breathing and listening to Moira talk, then please go ahead and buy this video. It is awful, you don't do anything in it, and Moira is annoying as hell!"
5,Great for beginners,"This is a great workout for anyone who is a pilates beginner as it gives very detailed and complete instruction regarding proper form and breathing. I would highly recommend this workout if you are just getting started. I can also see where this would be a perfect workout for new moms or anyone who needs a great, slower paced workout. Once you get past the beginner level however you find yourself wishing the instructor would ""get on with it"". I wish I had ordered the next level along with this DVD so that I would have an alternative workout for the days when I feel like I need to step it up a level."
4,Stott Pilates Ab Review,"I like the video...a very thorough introduction to all the basic Pilates exercises. I found Warm Up section especially helpful..to learn Pilates successfully you do have to learn how to correctly move through the exercises.If you have never tried Pilates this is a good video to start with, I recommend you proceed slowly and carefully...it may take a number of weeks to be able to do the routine..the pacing makes this feasible.abs,sto"
3,Gentle Introduction to Pilates,"""Stott Pilates: the Secret to Flat Abs"" is a fairly uncomplicated workout that is perfect for beginners. The slower pace allows you to focus on your breathing while Moira Stott-Merrithew's nurturing teaching style make you feel comfortable and safe.The exercises begin with gentle breathing and a focus on proper body alignment. While the exercises focus on the abs, you will also be working your back and arms. The exercises on this DVD include:Cat/Cow from YogaArm CirclesThe HundredRoll UpsHalf Roll BackLeg CirclesRolling like a BallScissorsShoulder BridgeSit UpsShell Stretch (Child's Pose)Push UpsIf you are new to Pilates this would be a good place to start or you may want to look for anything by Jennifer Kries. I can also highly recommend Windsor Pilates.~The Rebecca Review"
5,Calculator wasn't working,"Couldn't find this battery anywhere locally. Needed it for a calculator that is about 8 years old, but that I hate to give up. Went to Amazon and 'voila' there I found it. Received it in just a few days and my calculator is back in business. Thank you so much. You always come through with needed items."
3,One worked fine,Of the two batteries one worked fine but one was very weak right out of the package. The items arrived quickly.
4,Best *designed* RPG system...,"GURPS is a very good system for those who want to maximize what they can do with their games. There are no built in artificial restrictions and the players ultimately decide the limits. This is really a system where a character can be created for Ancient Rome and be picked up by a star ship without pause (though the character may need to learn some new skills, just as in real life). There are two drawbacks that detract from the Basic Set being better than it is. First, it is simply to big. Whole sections are wasted if you are not, for example, using Magic or Psionics or Grenades, and the odd mix of ancient and science fiction skills in the same list distract rather than clarify. The other is that the hand to hand combat system simply does not work very well for skilled and well equipped characters."
2,Bogged down in number crunching,"It may well be a function of the MTV attention spans and the faster lives we all live, however, I have roleplayed for 20 years now and used and created many systems. Gurps is just too cumbersome to use efficiently and making a character can take several hours if you're particular. The backround info is good though and most people I know buy the Gurps stuff just a source info or background material rather than to actually use them as rulebooks in a GURPS campaign."
5,Expand your roleplaying...,"I have been playing in the GURPS system for about 10 years now, and I really enjoy it for the flexibity the system offers. Granted, the combat system can be a bit more cumbersome in comparison to easier RPG systems like D20. BUT, the way you can personalize your characters more than makes up for this. When you get tired of total hack'n slash and want to work more on roleplaying and character development, then you are ready for GURPS. The adventures you can have are totally up to your imagination. I have played/GM'd space adventures, swashbuckling, fantasy, WWII, and even post apocalypic style adventures."
5,Best Game Ever,"I have been playing RPG's for almost 10 years now, and it is no small thing to say that this is my personal favorite. I have played D&D;, Rifts, Hero, Starwars, World of Darkness, BESM, Marvel Universe, and various others, but this is the one that is my personal choice.It is a generic game (could you tell from its title) which means that you are responsible for settings and campaign ideas. This can be anything from a fantasy, to sci-fi, to a combination of anything you can imagine.Character generation is strait forward and easy to understand when you get the hang of it, and your characters actually feel like true story characters with their own strengths and weaknesses built in to the mechanics of the game.It is fun."
5,"One of the best ""Role Playing Systems"" ever.","GURPS, one of the most succesful role playing systems, allow players to venture into any kind of story or world. It has two basic rule sets: basic and advanced. The first one, fast and fun, using only three 6 sided dice and the second one realistic, but a bit boring sometimes."
5,A great game system,"""GURPS"" is a very well thought out and balanced system; it is fairly easy to play any type of character you could think of. Not many systems have the flexibility of this one; you can play in a world where magic dominates or in a world where technology is the driving force or whatever you feel like... and all this using the same set of rules. If you want a game system that is easy to use and very flexible, ""GURPS"" is the RPG for you."
4,the rpg with batteries included,"GURPS is a generic role playing game system. It means that you could create a fantasy dungeon crawler campaign or a space opera, an horror modern campaign or a secret agent one both a CIA or SWAT agent and so on ...And the game is quite simple comparing with newer rpg edition. And , more important, is fun, terribly fun."
5,Review of GURPS 3rd Edition,"GURPS is a highly detailed, realistic role-playing game system. The game is simple in concept, yet can be layered with optional rules to be quite complex, if so desired. Highly playable!"
3,Not Enough Big Sticks in the Lineup,"""The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training"" suffers from Walter Matthau's absence. Matthau's sly, broken-down performance as Buttermaker that elevated the original. This time out, William Devane coaches the team, and though he does a fine job, the movie doesn't spark the way the first on did.Also missing is Tatum O'Neal. This time out, it's Jackie Earle Haley taking centerstage as the team sponsored by Chico's Bail Bonds heads to the Astrodome to battle the pride of Texas, the Toros. Devane is his Haley's estranged father and their relationship forms the emotional core of the film.This is a pleasant enough romp. But without Matthau and O'Neal and their classic characters, too many runners are left stranded on the bases, and the late inning rally just doesn't happen."
3,Not as good as the first movie but it's alright.,It was alright but not as good as the first movie and even though I like William Devane I was a little disappointed that Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal didn't also star in it but it's a decent movie that I recommend for anyone who likes movies about baseball.
2,Sasquatch Theater,"The latest film in the Sasquatch genre (there are enough now to call it that) is really pretty much just ho-hum. It isn't good (and what self respecting Sasquatch film would be) and it really isn't bad enough to elevate it to win a Golden Yeti as best Sasquatch film of the year. Not a lot of action here as it seems most of the killings, and with a crew of ignorant redneck hunters in the movie you can rest assured there will be killings, occur off-camera. I can understand this choice by the fimmakers as this Sasquatch is particularly rubbery and stiff. The film does feature a quick glimpse of Roslyn WA where Northern Exposure was depicted, particularly the Brick bar and grill. The film-makers took a big risk however in not casting Lance Henriksen in this Sasquatch outing as he has become synonomous with Sasquatch filmography (check him out at IMDB.com he has been in several other gigantopithecus extravaganzas)"
2,Wrong aspect ratio,"When I viewed this film (in NTSC) the first thing I noticed was that all of the cast were short and obese. Then I realised that the makers of the DVD have been careless and printed the film with the wrong aspect ratio. The DVD shows about 2.4:1 on the screen whereas the writing on the case jacket shows 16:9. Fortunately I was able to stretch the vertical part of the picture to obtain the right dimensions. The resolution lines then enlarge to the point where it becomes distracting - even with progressive scan. I am surprised no-one else has picked this up. With the right aspect ratio and ignoring the lines the picture is quite watchable with nice colors and scenery.The other reviewers are correct. This is not a horror movie. This is really about a monster's crusade to rid the world of criminals while leaving decent folk to live their lives in peace. Maybe a forest version of a type of caped crusader (eg. Superman, Batman and Robin, etc)"
3,Anco 20 inch wiper blade for 1995 taurus,Works well onthe old ford....It does the job but I think I like the Rain-X one better that previous purchased and wished I had bought another Rain -X
2,blades don't work well,"I expected the blades to be crappy based on the price: they are. Also, this is a single blade (a car has 2 blades). The crappiness comes in here: part of the blade hovers over the windshield and doesn't actually wipe any water away. However, this could be a result of me installing it myself, though I've installed blades in the past but never had this problem before."
2,wiper blades,These wiper blades are of good quality and perform well except fot the missing end on one. the upper tip is missing and the blade keeps slidind out of its place. It was incomplete whon I opened the wrapper. Thanks. Gary Hill
4,good wiper,"Got these for my 2000 Subaru Outback and they work well. No chatter or skipping at all. It rains here a lot and these wipers always work well. I replace them every October before the rains start. My only issue was the rear wiper arm was too low and contaced with the wiper. Other than that no issues. Great buy for the money. Stay away from auto stores, they over charge."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I have had this product for over 6 months now. Can't complain. I live in Florida and with the harsh sun, the blade has not dried out. Works nicely, does not squeak, and was easy to put on. Shipping was quick too. Why spend more? I purchased 4 blades as I replaced them on 2 cars. 1 of the blades arrived broken in half. Went online and they shipped me a new one right away before I even had a chance to return the broken one. Mistakes happen, but the quick resolution was greatly appreciated and painless."
4,Great value,"There's better wiper blades available, but not at this price. Been using these for years, usually purchased at one of the chain stores ending in ""mart"", and they work well. I try to buy ahead one pair and keep the spares in the car."
4,Good Blades,"The blades, once installed, work fine, and are a good purchase. The instructions on installing are a bit minimal. Since the wiper arm on a car/truck is steel and the blade assembly attaching the blade to the arm is plastic, you need to be careful not to use too much force or you will break the plastic attachment piece on the new blade end up with a window squeegee and unable to attach it to the wiper arm. It is easy once you have done one and see how it attaches. Just be careful; to attach the new blade exert a little force, but not a lot."
3,"Incorrect ""Exact Fit for 1996 Corvette"" label","Item was listed as an exact fit for my 1996 Collectors Edition Corvette. The item did install but the wipers are to large to return to the home position under the hood (bonnet). They will lodge, and scratch and possible chip the paint on the hood.The product is fine, the fitment for this vehicle is not."
3,You get what you pay for,"Average, Average, Average.If you are like me and haven't changed wipers since the day you bought your car- yes, this will be a marked improvement. But if you want the best ""wiping"" experience, I'd probably spring for something a little more expensive.However if you are here to get the best bang for your buck- then this is a deal.** Remember to buy TWO- I bought one, realized they do not come in a pair. DOH'.**"
1,Noisy blades,I have no idea what's wrong with these blades but the noise they create while just pushing water is unbearable. I'll be returning them shortly.
3,Should have bought OEM refills,"Got these wiper blades to replace the OEM ones on my BMW 323i. These are not built nearly as solid as the OEM wiper blades. But they work well enough. However, only 1 rain storm so far, and only time will tell if these would last. My OEM blades lasted about 10 years - honestly; Calif effect, I guess, or just lazy. In fact, this is first time replacing the wipers.I kept the OEM blades. Next time, I will just buy refills for them instead."
2,Poor Quality,"Looks nice, but after only a week it's leaving a streak of water on the windshield. I expected good wiping action for at least a few months."
1,Can't remove rubber insert from wiper,"The rubber insert has a metal locking feature that won't allow it to come out. So now I have to spend more to buy a whole new wiper assembly. I'm a mechanical engineer with 10 years experience, and this is the worst mechanical design I've seen in a long time. Please buy a different brand to save money and time."
2,"Inferior Longevity, chatters on upstroke.","Keep in mind, we're talking wiper blades here. They clear the windshield well, no streaking. There is little squeak when they first leave the park position on my vehicle. That said, I was wiping dew at the time. I'll update after a good gulf south downpour. I have used Anco before, they seem to be good cheap wiper blades.Update: Well, you never have to wait long for a good rain down here. Performance was good in a heavy rain. One thing I did note is that at higher speeds, 75+, the wind seems to catch the blade and make it skip. This is a full size E-350 van, so it may be the vertical windshield has something to do with that.Update 2: 2 months later, the blades chatter on the upstroke unless they are very wet. In a full downpour, they still function adequately, however as the rain slows, or if you are wiping dew, the upstroke is extremely noisy and doesn't clear the windshield."
1,An Eye Opener,"Last year I bought this plane from RAIDENTECH. They were selling it cheap so I decided to start my hobby with something low cost. Well, you get what you pay for. I automatically assumed that all RC planes advertised flew. The plane was just too heavy for its power output. I even took the bottom wing off to see if that would make a difference, no deal. How long the plane stayed air born depended on from how high I let it go. I went to target and bought the Air Hog Aero Ace and boy; the Aero Ace was and still is the bomb. I still have a lot of fun with the Ace.Thank you AMAZON for allowing feed back on products. I don't feel so bad now knowing that someone else can read about my misadventures and not make the same mistakes I have.It is durable though, but why buy a brick that doesn't fly?"
1,No Fly,"This Biplane has a NiMh battery and weighs 27 grams. Too heavy for powed flight. Orange toy two speed controler ( down for slow, up for fast ) with no trim control . Transmitter range with the 4' antenna was 20'.The single wing at 22 g flew in a left turn with full right input for 15 seconds before it ran out of power.Buy a plane with a LiPo battery and Transmitter with trim control."
1,If you want to learn Prince2 buy something else,"This is a lon.o.o.ng heavy going, turgid textbook of the sort that used to exist before authors and trainers got wise to the needs of students.It starts by trumpeting the virtues of Prince2as if they were unique to that system. It moves on to the subjects or processess without any real overview or prioritisation. In fact the book is written very like a software manual. Each chapter apparently unrelated to the others and there is an odd use of langauge throughout.In fact if I was trying to make a subject difficult to understand I could not be much better than this."
5,Amazing,Sash is like Darude meets some awesome vocalist. It is awesome trance with catchy vocals and great beats. This cd will really keep you dancing. A must have for any club fan.
4,Even more than I expected,"This book is significantly better than I thought it might be. Really good explanations of all parts of digital photography that someone with a new SLR needs to know. This book is above the level of describing depth of field, and the standard SLR questions. Only down side I have found is that the book is a bit Nikon focussed. Those of us with Canons would like a bit more for us!"
5,Excellent read and resource,"In transitioning from film to digital, I needed some books for a quick transition and to avoid reinventing the wheel. I don't have a lot of time, so a focused and detailed reference that could rapidly take me to a functional level was needed. I was very happy with the accessibility and the level of detail presented. I read the whole thing, but realize that I will need to go back to it to get the full value from it (e.g., when I find the need for a particular technique or action). It does address workflow, but that is not its focus, which I would describe as more of a broad, but sufficiently detailed introduction to many issues and techniques available to the digital photographer."
5,Pixie Dust Bite,"Buy Buy Buy! If your ears are vomiting of todays chart topping music and you prefer someting a little more strange, weird, screamed, spine tingling and most importantly influential, Surfer Rosa is your choice."
4,the best of the Pixies,"Many people seem to prefer Doolittle, but, in my opinion, this is the best bang for your Pixies buck. Their sound was simply revolutionary at the time Surfer Rosa was released, and even fifteen years later still sounds very fresh and innovative, despite the many bands who unsuccessfully attempted to imitate them. It's sort of a cross between hardcore and psychedelia, with blaring guitars, strident drums, and crazed, trippy lyrics. If you are into indie rock at all, well, then you probably already own this. If you don't, then you owe it to yourself to hear the roots of modern rock."
4,Out of Nowhere,"Ive had this CD for a couple of years, and never really gave it much of a chance. My first impression of Surfer Rosa was that I'd rather listen to Doolittle. The songs aren't as accessable on this record. Recently I began working it into my daily rotation, and I am shocked. I have no idea how I could have overlooked songs like Gigantic, Cactus, River Euphrates and some others. Black Francis (Frank Black) is one of the more underrated singers and songwriters of the last 20 years. I implore you to buy this album and give it more of a chance than I did."
4,Pixies at their best!,"I got started listening to the Pixies when my friend made me listen to ""Where is my mind?"" Which also appears on the movie ""Fight Club."" I loved the song. I went to a local record store so I could listen to the whole CD. It was amazing. I bought it right away. The Pixies were one of the best bands ever. Surfer Rosa and Dolittle are their best CDs. Hope you like it!"
5,5 star album -but the LP is not so special,"i bought firt the CD of the album which is a 5 star perfect album. Then i bought the LP hoping some sonic improvments of the format but LP is nothing special, did not add anything to sound quality unlike some albums which i own both on CD and LP."
4,I Love The Pixies!,This CD is fantastic! It's definitely worth buying. It's my favorite of all The Pixies' albums.
4,Review,"The front of the case had a somewhat large crack down the middle of it. Otherwise, perfect in overall condition."
2,over rated,"If you're expecting an album as consisten as Doolittle, save your money. There are only three good songs on this album, Cactus, Where is My Mind? and Gigantic. Everything else is nearly unlistinable. Most of the songs don't sound ""finished"". Some tracks arn't even songs, like Vamos, its just dumb filler. And Tony's Theme is just plain embarassing. I've listened to this alubum a number of times but I can't see what the big deal is. Their later albums are much better."
2,Man...this is mediocre,"- Barely any melody- Poor attempts at harmonizing (except Gigantic and Where is My Mind)- sub-par rhythm section- Sounds worse than a live album. Sounds like my band practicing but with a bigger budget.I tried to like the pixies. I tried, really hard too. I'm musically open minded and like similar artists like Superchunk, The Wrens, Smashing Pumpkins etc. ...i just can't ...like this except for a few songs.Thank god I downloaded this, or i'd be selling it now."
1,not as good as the cover art,"i bought this crapy cd because ""where is my mind?""was the awsome song at the end of Fight Club, but the rest of the cd is shit, the cover art of Surfer Rosa should switch with the cover art for the Downward Spiral, because that cd was as good as tits, this cd was more like the diarrea stain of music. all Indie rock sucks"
2,for fans of alternative music,"If you don't like 80's alternative music that was popular on college radio, don't get this album. I don't really find much talent in that genre or on this album. ""Where is my mind?"" and ""Gigantic"" are the only songs on this album that I would listen to multiple times. The other songs have no soul, groove or rhythm. Just a lot of distorted noise and nobody playing toghether - very Sonic Youth. This album is about 33 minutes long and we have to endure some kind of conversation for a whole minute toward the end of the disc. It is pretty sad that they couldn't even find enough musical material for filler."
1,The worst band of all time?,"Surfer Rosa is what it would sound like if Mike Tyson, Helen Keller, Pauly Shore, and a random homeless guy picked up instruments for the first time and decided to record an album. Was there a single actual musician in this band? I have never in my life heard a band that was so utterly, apocalyptically devoid of actual talent.It doesn't matter how influential this band was or how popular they were (or are) in college frat houses. Stupid music is stupid music, period, and The Pixies' attempts at writing 'music that's so bad that it's actually kind of good' failed miserably. Unless of course you think lyrics like ""This song is about a superhero named Tony!"" are the stuff of brilliance.Silliness is not an art form. This band was a crime against rock."
1,Pixies suck,THe pixies suck. Only good song is where is my mind. Don't waste time. Can't even waste time with this.
5,HAS THIS CD BEEN REMASTERED?,Great CD. Question - does this new 4AD CD release come with better sound than the (too quiet) Elektra CD from the early '90s? Any info would be appreciated.
3,Black seals Deal,"3 1/2SR is a little too uneven, especially in the back half, to measure up with the classic status of this fine successor, though still contains plenty of classic numbers itself right from the get go, and thanks mainly to Black's determined subversiveness, remains one of the more inspired alternative rock debuts to date."
4,Where is my mind,"Where is my mind off of the pixies first album surfer rosa is possibly one of the greatist songs of all time, especially considering it came out in what like 89-90. that's in the era when michael jackson was dominating the charts. the pixies made nirvana possible."
4,Oh My Golly!,"That's both good and bad. If I had to choose one word to describe ""Surfer Rosa,"" it would be 'baffling.' The majority of these songs are pop songs as tightly constructed as those of the Beatles, though with lyrics Paul McCartney would never dream of writing (""He bought me a soda and tried to molest me in the parking lot"" comes to mind), and wailing noise more in common with the work of Lennon's wife.That said, this is an occasionally superb record, with ""Bone Machine,"" ""Gigantic,"" and ""Where Is My Mind?"" all anticipating every guitar-based act to hit it big in the next decade. If you can stomach the album's disturbing hit-and-miss 2nd half, buy this right away."
5,"Worth it, even for one song","The entire album is great, but I'd buy it again over some of my other favorite bands for the song ""Where is My Mind"" alone."
5,The Best album of all time,"See, when you first listen to Doolittle, you say to yourself ""my, this is fantastic."" When you first listen to surfer rosa you say to yourself ""I can't wait to listen to Doolittle again."" But you must perservere. Because in the end, the songs you thought were noise, become so melodic they break your body with pleasure. And they keep growing and growing and growing on you until you start to desire running abord a ship that is never coming back, with one possesion in your hand. This album. And then you can lament for your abondoned love and her blood and sweat. Because somehow, they remind you of something..."
3,A dog who helps a boy find his special talents,"Case feels like he is the only one in his family who has no special talent, but he has plans to change that. He enters a talent show, a science fair, and a horse show, but fails to make a mark in any events. He is about to give up when he finds a dog, a remarkable dog, and the dog helps Case find his own special talents as a dog trainer as well as his special talent of sharing."
3,Way overpriced,Decent book on the subject but way overpriced on Amazon. Its only $7.95 new from the publisher.
5,love it,"bought this to use with my treo,love it very,gives your treo a very firm grip,surprisingly it have not stretched out as other cheap ones have,very good product,love it"
3,Just an ordinary accounting book,"The book is overall quite good as an introductory text for accounting, but there are other books out there, equally good, that come a lot cheaper."
3,Beware,"If this book is required for your class beware! There are still questions in the self study questions, through out the book that after 6 editions are still are wrong. The book will say one thing in the chapter and then want you to do another in the chapter questions, without the benifit of telling you how or giving an example. I took my course online without the benifit of an instructor to ask questions face to face. This proved to be difficult. I am sure if you have a GOOD understanding of accounting this is a good book however with out a little background it can be a little trying."
4,Accounting made easy!,This book is remarkably easy to read and fairly easy to understand. There are many examples and practice questions with answers in the front of the book.
3,Accounting coursebook,"The book had a tremendous amount of writing and highlighting, which was not a problem at all. I was very pleased. All I needed was the coursebook to complete my Accounting class."
5,Happy with my decision to go for a used book,I am pleased with my recent purchase of this used book. Book was in perfect condition and I am glad that I chose this over a new book and saved some money.
2,Frustrating book,"The problem with this text is that it shows you bits and pieces, but never really shows you a full example to put the concepts of the chapter together. There were questions that had nothing to do with what was taught and even a few that required answers that didn't refer to anything learned. I consider myself a good student and one that can pick something up fairly easily, but this book really pushed my limits. If you're taking an online course and need this book, I'd reconsider if I were you."
1,Worthless,"Terrible book for instruction. No clear process throughout the text book, and it jumps around from topic to topic.Should be re-written with a clearer message in the beginning and better organized lesson plans. Perhaps this is just accounting though in general. It would benefit the editors/authors to read a ""Fundamentals of Managment"" book. Perhaps this would help them organize the information better in this book. Good luck to anyone that buys it though..."
1,HORRIBLE,"HEED MY CAUTION:This book is the MOST POORLY WRITTEN TEXTBOOK I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS. DO NOT TAKE AN ONLINE CLASS THAT UTILIZES THIS BOOK, unless you already have a somewhat firm grasp on accounting. This book simply sets students up to fail. The explanations are extremely vague and shallow, and most of the problems at the end of the chapters have no prior explanation in the chapter. There is no way you will properly learn accounting from the lessons in this book. Even our own instructor advised us to purchase a different textbook. I am shocked that schools actually use garbage like this in their classes."
2,In search of the real info,"While there may be a lot of good information here, it is inseperably mixed with a lot of personal opinion and drum-beating. Instead of just compiling reports from qualified MDs, PhDs, etc., Carper regretfully goes one level further and INTERPRETS these studies for us. Unfortunately, she is not qualified to do that. Her background is not in medicine or health, she is just a writer. She wants to sell books, so she becomes super-positive with all her ""analyses"". Sorry, Ms Carper, your embellished opinions are not objective, are not scientific, are often flat WRONG, are not separated from the factual information, and thereby destroy what might have been an informative book. I suggest Holford's ""Optimum Nutrition for the Mind"", or Stoll's ""Omega 3 Connection"" for those interested in more science and less hype."
3,Take the info - leave the rest.,"I suppose, just like our bodies take specific nutrients from our food, we will need to take just the specific kernals of information, i.e. the types of supplements necessary for enhancing the brain's function and sift out the rest of her book. This isn't the best of Carper's books on nutrition, yet she still knows a great deal. Don't dismiss her work based on this book. A site where there is more documentation presented is iHerb. This site has a variety of products for brain, heart, body renewal, but what I appreciate most is that it isn't afraid to publish. iHerb contains links to many publications that can further develop what Carper begins here."
4,Great Perspective,"This book gives a very good idea of the value of educational psychology. Sternberg shows an excellent ability to teach through this book, and the way it is organized is superb. The research is up to date, and relevant.I believe it is a great buy for both introduction and deeper reflection into how the mind learns."
4,HANDY,"I've always felt I was surrounded by Wingnuts, now I have a whole box full of them. Thanks a lot!"
3,Not too bad,"Ready by Lucy Monroe was an easy read that I enjoyed, but wasn't anything worth keeping around. I was a little disappointed when the main problem was solved in a couple pages. I haven't read about Nitro or Hotwires romances so that might be next. I liked having them in the mix since they added a little drama of their own."
3,The last 100 pages were pretty good,"I have to agree with just about every negative review written here, even though I'm a big Lucy Monroe fan. The main characters did lacked tension, the plot was slow, and the lovescenes were weird. When I say weird, I don't want to imply that erotic scenes offend me. They do not. But the sweet heroine became so verbally raunchy, that I was embarrassed for her.I've enjoyed most of Lucy Monroe's Harlequin Presents and historical books. Mainly because she weaves such great emotional tension between her characters. That aspect of her writing was sorely missing in the first 200 pages of this book.And another thing, I felt like I was missing a part of their relationship in the beginning of the book, but I thought this was the start of a trilogy. There must be another book of hers where she shows their first kiss, etc. Maybe some of their crucial character development was in that book."
2,Just so-so,"Lise is being stalked, but, fortunately, she has a super-smart ex-Ranger as a brother-in-law, and he comes complete with two friends who I'm sure will soon be featured in their own books. Lise and Joshua, while forced into close company to thwart the evil stalker, soon get horizontal, as well as twist themselves into some other interesting positions. Between the (R-rated) sex scenes, Joshua repeated saves his lady love. Late in the story, Monroe throws in the oldest conflict in the genre -- the hero just doesn't believe in love and is stupid enough to tell this to the heroine and expect nothing but more sex in return. Sigh. Bottom line, I read the whole thing, but the characters were little more than cardboard and some plot was clunky and unbelievable (even for a romance!)"
4,"Avid Reader, California","I liked the book, but for some reason I felt it was missing something. It was not on par with (The Real Deal). Perhaps because the heroine was strong one moment and weak and clingy the next. And the whole she-wolf and constant use of Goodnight! kept distracting me from finishing the book. It was good but perhaps not one of her best."
3,"good premise, thin characters","OK, if I had wanted to read soft porn, this would have been a great book. But, I'm sorry, I read the book in about 1/2 the time it would normally take me to read something of this length because I skipped over most of the sex scenes.It's not that I'm a prude.But the things that they were accomplishing? Physically, I don't think that's possible.The premise of the story, however, was fantastic. A writer, being stalked, and her sister-in-law's brother, ex-special forces, with a huge crush on her, there to protect her? Right up my easy-read alley.The author does a decent job bringing this plot to life. She also does an OK job with the characters (but her names... only Will in ""Shakespeare in Love"" had a worse time with character names!)I won't be reading the rest of the series, but it was a good way to widdle away an afternoon.(*)>"
2,"Too much GRAPHIC sex, too little plot","I like a good romance. I like a good suspenseful story. This, however was neither. The book was just one graphic sex scene after another and little plot. The sex scenes were pornographic, simply put. After awhile, the scenes lost all their titilation and any semblence of romance. I imagine a man reading the scenes would be turned on. They were just gross to me. As for the plot, I kept hoping it would get around to it. After chapters of sex scenes I wondered what had happened to the stalker! Then when the story climax approached, it just fizzled. No story climax at all. What a let down. Skip this one."
2,"Enough, already!","I agree with a previous reviewer that Ms. Monroe's books cross the line into soft porn. I like a steamy sex scene but I want it to be brief and leave a little to my imagination. The characters are good, the dialogue is fine, just too much graphic detail for my taste."
2,"Ready, Willing, and Able","The entire trilogy was fairly readable, Lucy Monroe usually does a good job but all three of these books involved basically the same actions and reactions between the heroes/heroines: each hero has sworn he will never get involved so he can't possibly fall in love. Each heroine is either a virgin or has almost no experience with sex but of course has incredible sex with these emotionally distant men--yeah, right, their incredible penises are all they have going for them.And of course after all the sex they have while repeatedly telling the heroines this is not a relationship, just sex, they suddenly and for no apparent reason realize they LOVE the heroines so they can have a relationship after all."
4,Loved It,I would highly recommend this book if you are into romantic thillers. I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many on Amazon have already did that. I really got into and enjoyed these characters. I didn't like how it started out and was afraid that it was going to turn into a bad book but it turned around very quickly and stayed fast paced throughout. Yes it does have some sex scenes in it and if you aren't looking for that kind of book then you definitely need to pass on this book. They get rather steamy and explicit. I need to find the other two books in this series and maybe check out some of her other books. She reminds me of Cindy Gerard's Bodyguard series. I read this book in a day and really got into it. I loved how the characters bonded and connected so easily. It's a great beach book or something to keep warm by in the winter.
3,inconsistent sizing,"I loved the first pair of shoes that I bought from these guys. However, this time round, I bought the exact same pair in the same size and they are a little bigger. I wish Five Ten would be more consistent with their sizing and quality control."
1,piece of junk,"after five months of non-daily wear, they got a big tear in the covering - its not leather, not sure what the material is. cheap crappy shoes, don't waste your money at this price."
3,Comfortable but ugly,"I bought the shoes mainly for comfort, but they are the ugliest shoes I've ever owned. I call them my ugly shoes."
1,"Phone doesn""t fit well","Case is listed to fit my LG phone, but the cover won't close with the phone in it!"
1,A guide to....nothing at all,"I assumed, from the title, that this would be a book of practical advice for giving parties. Instead, it was a thinly disguised excuse for the author's collection of anecdotes about the Washington rich-'n'-famous. The only practical advice given are gems such as ""temperature is important--don't let your guests be too hot or too cold."" Gee--that one I'd already figured out for myself. If you want to read about the Washington social scene, this is a great book. If you're seeking advice about how to entertain, don't bother with this one."
3,The Party: A Guide Drinking with Lots of Famous People,"In many ways, ""The Party"" follows its own rules. Its main goal is for the reader to have a good time, and not get too stuffy. Quinn moves quickly through all the party essentials, in a conversational style that makes it an easy one-night read. Remember that she is culling from the Washington party circuit - if you get cranky from name dropping, this book isn't for you. What the names do is underscore how important the guest mix is when planning a great party. Certainly Quinn seems to gloss over the importance of full-time staff and caterers, but for the most part the suggestions are on target the anectdotes (real or imagninary) serve to illustrate the various topics. Miss Manners may certainly give you more precise formulae for parties, but Quinn's are realistic and fun to read. Remember - the point is to have a good time!"
1,One name drop to many,I entertain a lot so I bought this book thinking in was a guide to entertaining.I am not from the USA so I didn't have a clue who this women was I also hadn't heard of half the people she mentioned.I found the book boring and thought that Mizz Quinn was a big headed bore.There are many good books out there on Entertaining but this is NOT one of them
3,Nice to know that the art of giving a party isn't lost!,"I enjoyed this book. Sure, Ms. Quinn's means are above the means of most readers, but what the hell, improvise! I guess I liked this book mostly because it reassures me that my wife and I aren't the only people left that know how to entertain (we do it so well). And the recipe for Jerry Mazzetti (page 97) was damned good!"
3,Bowl doesn't fit cover,"I bought this workbowl for my Cuisinart DLC-7 after reading all of the reviews I could find. Most of the reviews said the bowl worked fine with their old cover, but mine doesn't fit. The bowl needed to have a tab removed in back, which I did, but the bowl is also slightly too small for the old cover. I didn't want to spend another $25 on a new cover, and then even more for a new pusher, so I've been trying to sand down the rim of the old cover to make it work. After a LOT of work, I can finally use the old cover, (and thus get the machine to work) but it will never be as easy to use as it was. By the way, my old bowl/cover was amber colored, and the new bowl is gray. I called customer service at Cuisinart and asked them about it and they said they don't make the exact bowl for my old cover anymore. The bowl itself is fine, and fits my machine (thus my rating). In my opinion, this information should be available to anyone purchasing this bowl."
5,a perfect fit!! arrived sooner than I thought. I am VERY pleased,a perfect fit to my current processor. Arrived sooner than I thought. I am VERY pleasedI was glad to be able to use my processor for Holiday Food prep
2,costly and did not fit machine,"Had to buy a replacement bowl since our original broke. Figured it would be better to spend 35 bucks for a bowl than buy anew cuisinart even though 35 dollars is ridiculous for a piece of plastic. Be that as it may, I bought it and then it did not fit correctly with my machine. Had to use a knife to slice some plastic off so the machine could work properly. Not too nice for an expensive piece."
5,Cuisinart bowl,Well made. Does the job it's made for. Lasts a long time. I bought thethe DC7 Pro in 1981 and have only replace the bowl. Motor is still going strong.
3,Have bought 3 in 8 months,"Title should say it all. This is my third bowl in 8 months. The seller was great, bowl came very quickly. However, cuisinart has cheapened these bowls so bad. I am a very heavy user. I use it roughly once a day - sometimes 3-4 times on a weekend. I am vegan so do everything from pesto, to chopping nuts, to making sauces and doughs. The first bowl cracked at the top where the lid clips on. The second has about 10 vertical cracks at the bottom around the outside and the liquid slowly leaks out. As mentioned, I just bought my third, because I don't have the money for a vitamix (I guess by now if I saved money from bowl replacements I would. I give it 3 stars because it is a great product and the seller was top notch; but, cuisinart needs to start making the bowls with glass or stainless though - or use a harder more durable plastic."
2,New Version,"There is no annotation here, but this is a CD of her new bastardized 21st century version of the original hits. Old school fans like me usually hate the way. Beware."
3,Not the soap you'll get,"The soap I received was not like the picture. All white on one side and all PURPLE on the other. But on a plus side, the soap smells really good :)"
2,Disappointed,"The idea is fun, but the package is a bit too basic, the soap does not look like make from good material. For $6, I expect it will be more elegant or pack it like a gift item. No just a bar of soap!"
5,Great gag gift,Went over well at our Christmas party when we exchanged gifts. Anyone wanting a unique gift I would recommend buying this.
3,Great gag gift,Good value for it's purpose of a gag gift! Haven't used the soap so can't review that.... but soap goes great with butt/face towel. Recommend product.
1,Misrepresented,This is not the bar of soap you will get. You will get the same kind everyone else is selling. ALL white on one side(inclusing letters) and all brown on the other side (inclduing letters)
4,A good follow-up,"Everyone into punk or skinhead rock knows about Slaughter & the Dogs' first LP. Yet this second effort (released two years later with a different line-up) is unfairly ingored. Going for a more traditional rock sound as well as punk ""Bite Back"" delivers great songs such as ""now I know"", ""what's wrong boy"", ""crashing out with Lucy"" (amazing Guns N Pousers never covered that one), ""she ain't gonna show"", but the best moments are ""hell in New York"" and the ballad ""east side of town"" (the ONLY skinhead tune to sound like Billy Joel!)."
2,not his best,"I read Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You and am a bit surprised how inferior this book is. He wrote ""Someday"" quite recently, so maybe it's a good sign that he is getting better. This book is really pretty hard to take. Writing it is simple yet awkward at the same time. Odd. So a mediocre grade for style points. The characters are moderately well developed. Overall not exactly a sterling effort."
2,did nothing for me.,this book was hyped as a south american surrealist love novel equivelant to Aurelia Aurora or nadja... by a contemporary of neruda.its about 100 pages so i gave it a shot. nada. maybe its a bad translation or maybe im not ready for it or ? but there was perhaps one poetic passage in the entire novel that caught my eye.
3,bulky leather case,I agree with Mr. Howard W. Rhee from Arlington. The case is nice but it is bulky due to the extra flap in the case. I wish that H. Packard will remanufacture this case without the extra flap in order to make the HP-720 portability useful.
3,Flat case for Jornada 720 available!,"Try [...] as they do what seems to be a lovely flat case for the 720 without the flap. It costs $75. I know the previous reviews are a few years ago, but this info may help someone."
4,Great for portfolio,"I used these slide films among others, and it really help me with my art portfolio."
4,This was a good book,I am reading through the Sports Illustrated's top 100 sportsbooks of all time and this book is deservedly on the list. I found it a little dated but the research that Axthelm poured into the book makes it worthy of a read. It has become a historic book and one that I am proud to own.
2,old book,"not worth the time to read as it is so outdated, a more recent biography would be interesting. Gave up after a few pages."
3,Great for reluctant readers--especially elementary school boys,"My reluctant reader has this about memorized!! We're buying another from the series soon. Not the greatest in parent's opinion but currently son is saving it for ""his own son""!!"
2,Bible Heroes & Bad Guys,"Apparently this book was not proofread before going to press. I have found many mistakes and typos. One example, is on page 21 under ""Bible Supercharge"": the Bible reference is ""Proverbs 37:3"". When I wrote to the publisher about it and other mistakes, I received no response.Another rather annoying aspect is the language used. I realize that the authors are trying to be ""hip"" so as to communicate on a child's level, but I found I had to stop continuously and explain to my son ""what that means"". We just don't talk that way, and my kids have never heard of many of the phrases used.This book started with a good idea, but it could have been so much better. The most disappointing aspect was the apparent sloppiness and uncaring attitude of the publisher."
1,Buyer Beware! - This eBook is not the book described.,"The descriptions and reviews on this page refer to the printed book, not the ebook. This ebook consists simply of a brief 7-8 synopsis of 10 of the 30 laws, along with a link to the publishers website, and an ad to buy the full book. To make matters worse, amazon.com is charging $2.00 above retail price.There is very little more information in the ebook than is in the summaries on this page. Don't waste your money on what is essentially a $5.00 advertisement for the printed book. Buy the printed edition insead."
1,$ Down the Drain! Don't make my mistake!,"I saw the average star rating and didn't look further - I knew this was the book I wanted. If I had bothered to read the first review I would have been warned about what I fell for. This IS NOT the book. It's a few pages that barely cover any information at all, just an overview of his first 10 principles."
3,Well what DO I do?,"I can't decide whether or not to read this book. There are so many other books to choose from, and I keep putting off the decision. People tell me this is a good book, and although I appreciate the opinions of others, I'm uneasy making the decision. I feel frozen on the spot. I give the book 3 stars, since it's the middle score, and saves me having to make a decision either way."
2,One of the batteries was just about dead upon arrival.,"Not sure what happened, but one of the batteries in my two-pack was just about dead upon arrival."
1,Duracell batteries leak,"I recently contacted Duracell regarding a leaky battery that destroyed my $100.00 clock. After a bit of a hassle on the phone I was told I would be sent a pick up package to send my clock to Duracell for inspection. Well, the package came and it was large enough for a pocket watch not my wall clock I described earlier. At this point I feel by the time this issue is resolved the time and effort will not be worth it. Perhaps that is what they are counting on. Buy Duracell at your own risk."
3,Doesnt really work,This product for some reason is not so compatible with the object I got it for. It only works if I use an old battery at the bottom and a new one on top. It's very strange.
5,Exactly as described.,Did what it was supposed to do. Quite happy with purchase. Would recommend to anyone with these toners. Well built
3,Not Convincing,This book had interesting ideas from Mr. Holzer's point of view. Some of the ideas were far out of common thinking---maybe a little bit kooky. But I enjoyed hearing about his ideas of the supernatural world.
2,Get Your ShipTogether,"Skip this book. With the exception of Ward Clapham's story the book is exceptionally boring. I think what I disliked most is the Authors (D. Michael Abrashoff) constant comparisons of the leader he was writing about and his time in the NAVY. I would just be getting a good picture of Leader he was describing and he would ruin the feel by adding another ""this one time on BENFOLD"" story. Mr. Abrashoff, you did well on BENFOLD but it's time to find a new hook to hang your cover on!"
5,Guide to creating a culture of action!,This book has single handedly turned my business (45 people so far) from a company of complainers to a culture of ownership. I purchased 14 books had weekly meetings using the chapters of the book as examples and allowed my people to take ownership of their own destiny. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK to any business owner struggling with how to turn a company culture and point it in the right direction!
4,Not enough information...,This DVD seems to be a recording of a seminar done in England. It is missing a lot and seems to be in the incorrect order. The end result is that I feel Tom just skimmed the surface without really explaining about how the many types of inductions really worked. 90 minutes ISN'T really a lot of time to learn hypnosis.
2,"Good sound, poor durability","I have owned two pair of these headphones, and while the sound quality is rather surprising for such cheap headphones, the build quality is lacking.Using these headphones with an MP3 player in my pocket for just a few months, the cord going into the plug became damaged inside the plug, resulting in garbled sound unless the cord is flexed at the plug to an extreme angle. When this happened to my first set, I assumed it was a fluke problem in manufacturing and purchased another. The same exact thing happened to the second set.I'm afraid I cannot recommend these otherwise good headphones due to their inability to stand up to normal usage."
1,i bought this from Enlighter and they are a dirty cheat u place,"i bought these head phones from Enlighter and they cheated me. i,ve had these head phones in the past and they are great head phones just don,t buy anything from Enlighter"
2,get something better,"lets face it, you are probably looking at these because you want something cheap, but these are super uncomfortable, just bought them today, sound is good but they are made for smaller heads, which i have a medium large head, and it hurts, i should have spent some more money to get something more comfortable"
5,I thought these were from 2006!,"Date first available at Amazon.com: June 1, 2006I read that and hoped for the 2006 headphones but alas I got the ones from 2010. Ohh well they look nice and high tech but I spent $40.00 on what I consider garbage!"
5,a rip-roaring romance with a hero to die for!,"Wonderful novel! Exciting, sexy, adventurous, and the relationship between the protagonists, Chandra and Blade, keeps you reading and sighing well into the night. A simply delightful historical novel! Bravo, Suzie Morris!"
5,"Great book -- funny, but full of good content, facts, ideas.","I just sent in a review from Centralia, Missouri... It opened with ""It's like sitting around a hot stove with a genius."" I'm not sure I remembered to put my email address... It is (see below):"
1,Preachy and Long Winded,"After a promising start about his relationship with the ""Old Perfesser"", Casey Stengel, Herzog's account reads more like a long winded sermon. I expected more substantial content rather than a rambling diatribe about how much the game has deteriorated. After a while, I couldn't stomach Whitey's egoistic rants about his slant on baseball strategy. Yes, he was a great manager but he is not the sole proprietor of baseball genius. It is a meandering read and a major disappointment."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I hate to rain on everyone's ""Whitey parade"", but I was disappointed with the book. Maybe my expectations were too high; knowing Herzog to be a baseball ""lifer"", I was expecting a book filled with insights about today's game and ""inside baseball"". While there are some gems , they are hard to find. Too much of the book is filled wth Herzog's rants about almost every facet of the game today and anecdotes that often are not amusing nor insightful except to expose Herzog's enormous ego.His constant self aggrandizement detracts from his message. Maybe self aggrandizement is his message."
2,"Good start, but ultimately too self-serving","Whitey's book starts off well enough, with good stories of his days as a player and a scout. His perspectives as a manager, however, are too narrow for anyone who isn't a die-hard Cardinals fan. And don't get him started on calls that went against the Cards, different styles of play, and other ball parks. Too bad this book isn't better for a broader audience."
2,Why Is It So Inexpensive?,"This light is cheap and it looks cheap. I hung it anyway in my breakfast nook, but I am not thrilled with it. Brushed steel color is nice and the globes are nice, but all in all, it looks as cheap as its price."
3,Where's the tomato sauce?,"Three stars because I didn't watch the movies. Bought as a gift for western-starved friends who enjoy watching the bad guy bite it. They had no complaints about the quality of discs but they are not techies or critics.If Lee Van Cleef ain't in it, it ain't worth watching."
4,I Like This Coffeemaker,"The Melitta MEFB2W 12-Cup Digital Coffeemaker is a great value at 39.95. I have spent more for a coffeemaker only to find the workmanship to be less. Melitta is well made, holds up in everyday use and provides a cup of coffee at the temperature I prefer. The carafe is made of thicker glass, pours perfectly and stands up to the occasional bump unlike say Krups, which it extremely thin and I seemed to break regularly. I recommend the Melitta MEFB2W, it is simple to use, makes a good cup of coffee and in my opinion made to last."
2,Disappointing,"We used this coffeemaker for less than a month when it just stopped working. The lights went on but no coffee brewed & the unit did not get hot. When we called the number in the brochure, we did not receive any help. (There are no trouble shooting hints in the material accompanying the coffeemaker.) We are very disappointed since we liked the coffee, the design, the carafe, etc."
1,Worse coffee maker ever owned!,"We have always owned lower priced units and decided it was time to treat ourselves to something nicer. We bought this one based on the name and brand reputation. This is the worst coffee maker we have ever owned. Our last one was a $$$ Mister Coffer and other than not being hot enough it was far superior to the Melitta.We have owned it for about three weeks now and it has gotten stopped up and over flowed at least six times. I called the manufacturer and they sent me another filter basket. I used the new one this morning and it did the same thing!I plan to call them again and find out what my options are as to getting a different model. Also, it is hard to replace the carafe after you pour your coffee. It is a very attractive unit, but function seems to have been comprimised in order to make it good looking."
1,Want a Recall!,"We purchased Melitta coffeemaker (MEFB2) because of fast brew feature in June, 2003. However in August, 2004, it shorted out and burned at one of the connections of the circuit board and blackened some of the plastic. Sparks flew without tripping the circuit breaker. The sneak-a-cup feature worked only intermittenly throughout ownership."
2,Did not last,"I never used the coffee make to stop and get a cup, but I had problems with the feature early on. I would set the time and the spring would get stuck while the maker was brewing. This would cause the filter chamber to fill up and overflow leaving a big mess to clean up. I finally dismantled that option.I just got done throwing the unit out after it quit from two years of medium service. I had a Bunn coffee maker previously and did not want to shell out the money. The Bunn had lasted me over 10 years. Needless to say, I went back to Bunn and bought the thermal version from Target. I have only had it for a week, but I am thrilled so far."
3,This coffeemaker does the job.......,"While this coffeemaker is not perfect, it does do the job. I like the carafe design...very little if any spilling. I like the speed at which the pot of coffee is brewed and the temperature it's held at. I do not like that I need to be extra cautious as to how much water I put in or the basket will overflow putting grinds in my coffee. Solution? Fill the carafe to 12 cups or UNDER and you should be ok. I find the Melitta brand filters work better than offbrand. Also, I don't like that the grinds splash up on the brewing ""lid"" and when you lift it to put water in the grinds may go into the water reservoir."
2,Okay coffe maker,"I recieved this coffee maker as a wedding gift. It is great at brewing coffee quickly and has minimal spilling. However, I broke the craft 7 months later and have had a headache trying to find a replacement for my white craft. The black is easily replaceable and can be found on Melitta's website, but my white crafe is nowhere to be found."
2,"worked great, when it worked!","I bought this coffeemaker about 10 months ago after carefully reading many reviews. When I first got the coffeemaker I had a little trouble adjusting the timers with out reading the directions,after reading, no problem!The coffee was hot and it brewed fast. Sometimes the burner had a funny burning electrical smell. It worried me a little!Yesterday, I splilt water on the front of the machine and it no longer works. I don't believe that a coffee pot would break just being exposed to water!"
2,Died after 18 months - look elsewhere,"Pros: made a decent cup of coffee in a hurry. carafe poured smoothly without drips.Cons: unit quit after about 18 months use. Even when it did work, i never used the programming feature b/c it was very tedious --- and on my unit, at least, there was no memory so any settings were lost when it was powered down."
1,I don't recommend this coffee maker,It was hard use and learn to use. Leaked if pot was not placed properly. Timer broke one week after warranty expired. Steam condensed on upper cabinets; had to be set on edge of counter. I will never buy this brand of coffee maker again.
3,Replaced in a month,I also bought this and had to return it within a month just quit working. One good point was Melita replaced it for no charge even sent me a postage paid mailer. Replacement unit is working fine been using it for 6 months.
5,Your Primary Guide to Paris,"Assuming you aren't a Paris expert, then you do need a guide to give you some orientation and also to suggest lodging, etc. Fodor's has published a sufficiently wide-ranging guide that you could make do with it alone. So, if you can only take one guide, buy and take this one. Also, it's lightweight and well sized for travel."
2,unreliable at best,"Since I had never been to Paris, I bought a number of books besides this one. Thank God! Not only did the room description in the book not resemble the room I was in, but the directions to the hotel were messed up. The closest subway station to the hotel (as per the instructions) was on a different subway line in a different neighborhood than the real station - which by the way -was a rail road station. I have no idea where they dug up the hotel from, because no-one around it even knew the street name. I would not be surprised if the Eifel Tower directions send you Versaille. Luckily - I did not have to find out."
5,Easy Battles for Lazy Armies - review,"I simply adore Robert's work. His words makes you laugh, they make you think, they're undeniable truth in its grittiest form. I'm currently moved on to After the First Shot, another lovely book of poetry, and can't wait for the publication of his latest, 4th and Hill Is Gone Forever. Check him out if you crave some poetry. You will not be disappointed!"
1,Wow,I can't find the words to describe this utter failure. The spooky sounds and images are highly repetetive and hokey. The production value is hilarious. There is no way to skip the more annoying effects to get to the halfway listenable ones because it's all one long track. The only scary part was that I actually paid 13 dollars for it.
1,Crap! Don't waste your money!!,"If there was a way to give this dvd several negative stars I would definitely do it! What a waste of money! All you see in the whole thing is a couple of different PLASTIC pumpkins set in different badly staged places. Sometimes they are lit with a fake flame sometimes they aren't. Oh yeah...there is some guy skulking around in a cheap Halloween costume too. The sound effects are laughable. I was planning to have this playing in the background of my Halloween party this year but would now be embarrased to. The packaging is deceiving in regard to whether it was made professionally. I'll either be giving this away, probably anonymously to an enemy, or throwing it away which is redundant in regard to the $10 I spent on it. Be warned...the 5 star rating this has received was probably entered by the creater of the dvd."
1,wonder why latoya took her clothes off,"latoya could'nt sing, she could'nt dance guess papa joe wasa too busy wooping her brothers to actually make her practice well we all know joe used to creep with her and rebbie. anyway latoya was'nt much of a model so she went the sex route and took her lothes off and married an unattractive white guy who pimped her out in the uk no wonder her albums sold in the uk. gotta admit if i was rich I'd paid her for sex."
3,It was alright,"This was much better than Bad Girl, I'd strongly recomend this for LaToya fans. It did have some very good songs, like night time lover, that's one of my favorites, But honestly, I'd like them to release My special Love because it has stay the night, which (I feel) is the second best song she ever did."
5,A Respectable Debut,"I'm very pleased to see this album finally on CD. Just got mine today, and must say, the people at CherryPop Records who released this (originally acquired from Polydor) did a lovely job in keeping the integrity of the original artwork and packaging. Not to mention the audio quality.""If You Feel The Funk"" was one of the singles set for LaToya Jackson and she performed it and the stunning single, ""Night Time Lover"" on television in 1980, upon its release. The latter song was produced by Michael Jackson, and you can hear his vocals in the chorus. I always felt this was one of LaToya's strongest songs, perfectly suited for her. Also heard are contributions by Ollie E. Brown and Stevie Wonder. Very good old school R&B;."
1,La Toya Jackson - La Toya Jackson,"I give this album one star because the only song worth listening to is the first track ""If You Feel The Funk"". (And thats saying something)I much rather La Toya's work after this album. I only plan to buy it because I love La Toya!"
4,The DVD's I've been waiting for...,"Was a great series before it was cancelled by the network. Was truly written for the adult or teen. Good animation for it's time. Most story lines remained progressive to the seasons end, and what an ending. Would highly recommend this for the true blue, ol' fashion, superhero lover in all of us."
4,"great show!, dvd setup not great","I have to agree with what everyone is sayingWhat I love about this product was the JL show itself. All the wonderfully written stories that I got to watch again, some along with creators' commentaries.Where this lacks is the packaging, a 4 dvd set the designed to fit into the size of a single dvd container. This was the same way the Fantastic Four 1990s animated series was released. I don't have much of a problem with that. The only thing really bugs me is that the chapter/scene selection sucks. hitting the ""next scene"" button on the remote is useless.Overall you can see all the love went into the shows itself. They skimped on the way of making it a great DVD experience.Its still worth owning, just with they put more attention into making it a dvd set to treasure"
4,GREAT CARTOONS - BUT NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES,"I would have given 5 stars if not for a niggling problem with the discs.The first season of Justice League is among the best that DC/Warner Animation has to offer. From the origin story to the epic 3-part finale, the episodes will entertain both youngsters and adults (I watch these with both my 8 year old and my mom). I will not comment on them individually because other reviews here that do that well.Beware however if Subtitles are important to you. While the box set is supposed to have English subtitles (even says so on the box) in fact it only has French and Spanish.This looks to be a production issue since the box states there are English subtitles, so I'm returning mine and waiting for Warner to correct this in a future batch.As long-time fans know, whereas Warner Animation is excellent, Warner Home Video consistently lets fans down with poor product features and no attention to detail. This seems to be yet another case of that."
4,Cartoon classic revised,"First off I've got to say, thank you to the creators for not putting Robin with Batman. This show is a very well put together re-creation of the origins of the justice league. The episodes are all two parters except for the first and last episodes of the season which can be tedious when watching them all in order but they are solid with excellent voicing and creative ways to pummel a vast array of bad guys. Instead of Smallville's way of Clark showing up at the last second to throw the evil doer across the room the creative and new ways they think of to foil the plans or punch darkseid in the face keep you wanting to watch more. While this is not the best season of the Justice League it's still great to see how it began, however I do reccomend season two over this one."
3,Not bad!,Not bad. Animation was something to get use to. I have no idea why the had to make Superman and Batman look different. However the stories are good. I'm planning to buy the Season 2 and Unlimited Seasons soon.
5,Justice League is now on Bluray!,"I find the bluray an improve over the DVD despite not being in widescreen, which doesn't bother me by the way. I do wish some bluray exclusive features were added such as explaining why Batman wasn't used to his full potential. I felt like every show should have had all members doing something including Batman even though he was a part timer. it's still a fun show to watch.I'm not gonna go through each episode. It's a great show and you should watch it."
2,Not what i expected,it was not the full season. only about 2/3 of episodes. not happy. large chunks of episodes gone. i feel cheated.
1,the worst show ever to feature batman and superman,I'am really really sad that two of dc comices greatest hero's are treated so poorly in this sorry excuse for a tv show. Yes there are some episodes were superman and batman are treated with some respect. But this series is so badly badly done a superman and batman team up tv show would have been much better then this show that insults the real justice league from the grphic novels.
5,A Great Gift for a JL fan,"This dvd is great for any super-hero fan. It contains the entire 26 episode season on 4 DVDs. Whether you're a new JL fan, or you've read all the comic books, this is a great dvd for your collection."
4,Very entertaining rendering of classic DC superheroes,"The more I watch of the current crop of big-budget, over-hyped, live-action film versions of popular superheroes, the more I feverently believe that comic books and cartoons are the once-and-forever true medium for these characters. A bunch of guys and dolls in form-fitting, candy-colored underwear just play better in ink than celluloid, you know what I mean?Anyway, this @2001 version of ""Justice League"" produced by Cartoon Network really gets it right: simplistic enough for kids, intelligent enough for adults, and entertaining enough for comic fans and non-fans. Don't confuse it with the goofy ""SuperFriends"" you watched as a kid -- or with the dark and brooding, ultraviolent graphic novels of the 80's and 90's. This is good, old-fashioned, morally unambiguous Good Guys v. Bad Guys stuff, with just a enough tongue-in-cheek wit to let you know it doesn't take itself too seriously."
1,LIES ALL LIES,"I would rather eat my own poop then to pay money for this game. It doesn't work with windows XP, no music, and half the sound effects are missing. If it's not in drive D it won't run at all. Also if you have a usb controller, guess what? You can't use it. That's right. Don't buy it, it doesn't matter if it's 20 cents... don't waste your money, try to bum a nickel off of someone, go to a cashier, get a quarter for your two dimes and a nickel, and buy a gum ball instead. You'll be more satisfied."
2,Surprisingly Boring in Many Places,Best to skim this one -- some parts are extremely interesting (like the Watergate Period) and others so boring that it almost makes it easy to put this aside.
5,"an interesting ,well written book. enjoyed the experience.","Ben Bradlee's career as a journalist encompassed many of the mostimportant events of the late 20th century: from World War II toWatergate, from the domestic revolutions of the '60s to theinternational revolutions of the '90s. While serving as theWashington Post's Executive Editor from 1968 to 1991, thenewspaper became a world-renowned and respected model offearless and innovative journalism. A witty and candid story of agood life -- and a great read.This text refers to the hardcoveredition of this title. -"
3,entertaining,"Chatty tale of Bradlee's upbringing, early adventures in the press business, friendship with JFK, the Pentagon papers, Watergate, and the Janet Cooke scandal at the Washington Post. A pretty lightweight, but honest and entertaining, memoir from a man who is as much a raconteur as an editor. Abridged audiobook, read by Bradley."
5,Great knife.,I have never used a boning knife before and this one is a real treat. I has remained sharp after several weeks of use and allows very precise cuts.
2,Q-See Quality,"Q See Quality?????I purchased the Q-See QSNDVR4R as part of a security system complete with four cameras. While performing an initial parts count and visual inspection, the following discrepancies use found:1) The instruction manual was written in French.2) On the DVR: All camera input BNC connectors retaining (4) nuts are missing.3) On the DVR: Both video output connectors are protruding at approximately 85 degree from the case instead on the normal 90 degree? Is this stressing the circuit board? Only one had a retaining nut installed. Where was Quality Control?Bench checkInitial setup was uneventful. After running the system overnight, I shut it down for a few hours. After power up, one camera failed to produce an image. Resetting power corrected the problem. What happens during a power interruption?The DVR noise lever is much higher than I expected. I'm using the system in a private residence."
3,A vitriolic look at a Navy ward,"Mr Styron's theatre play is set in 1943 in a urological ward of a Navy hospital. There are several soldiers all of whom suffer from various venereal diseases, their presence being ""a sign of the moral breakdown the war has brought about"". Schwartz, a solemn Jew, a South-born black called Lorenzo Clark and a syphilis patient, Wally Magruder. The latter has to wear a special bathrobe marked with a yellow ""S"" and he has to use a washbasin reserved for patients suffering from the same disease.Among the staff, there is Dr Glanz, well known for ""always wanting people to be sick"" and the homosexual male nurse Lineweaver who naturally delights in examining the patients in the ward.A tragic and at the same time comic play about the way patients can be manipulated and mislead by the medical profession, the competence of which is clearly to be mistrusted according to Mr Styron."
4,Amelia Bedelia's Family Album,"My daughter and I have been enjoying Amelia Bedelia books for a long time. Even before my daughter was able to understand the puns, she knew something silly was going on. We have a whole collection of these books and enjoy reading them over again. If you like silly puns, you will love Amelia Bedelia and the clever writing of Peggy Parish."
2,Did not live up to expectations,"Did not live up to expectations, this book seemed a little flat and forced compared to other Amelia Bedelia books. My five year old did not like it and did not want me to read it after the first time through. If I had bought this at the store, I would have returned it."
5,meet amelia's family!!,"My 7 year old son checked this book out for the library and started reading it alund to me on the way home. We have read several amelia books before and this gave us an inside look at her""family""A must read for all Amelia fans!"
3,Falls Short of Amazing,"Ok. And so I've had this album on my Amazon.com Wishlist for over a year and a half now, and I just got this 2 weeks ago. So I probably don't have to explain the extreme anticipation I was experiencing prior to popping this one into the stereo.But ah, the sheer disappointment I have suffered with this record since then is difficult to put into words. And that's because I'm such a massive fan of Lighthouse Family that I don't feel like writing a single bad review about them. In fact it pains me - so I won't.All I will say is that you're better off not buying this one. A couple of remixes are good and most of the acoustic versions are nice... but all just fall short of being amazing - as should be (and has been) with all (the other) Lighthouse Family releases."
3,"Does Not Fit Canon 60D, However...","This remote timer does not fit the Canon 60D - the ""D60"" is a Nikon. However, Amazon does sell an adapter that allows it to be used with the 60D ""DSLRKIT Shutter Remote Terminal Convert Adapter Cable N3F-E3M"". While impatiently waiting for the adapter to arrive from overseas, I ordered the Satechi WTR-C Wireless Timer Remote Shutter from Amazon at half the price of the Canon TC80N3. It has all the features of the Canon model including great quality AND IT IS WIRELESS! If you still want the Canon TC80N3, look for mine on eBay real cheap!!!"
3,Canon TC0N3 Timer Remote,The only problem I've found with this product is that it does not appear to have a way to turn it off. I've been taking the battery out.
4,extra gadget for the adventurer in you,"it is expensive, for a piece of plastic and some circuit boards, no on-off switch, buttons are small and the connector can be connected to all the pro-body eos's, so what's not to love, i think, if you love photography, this gadget is a must, people complaine about it for all sorts of reasons, but what else can we do. if you want to get more adventure and learn how other people got their shots, this tool is a must have. if you want to shot with you on it, just use the camera timer. :) or ask somebody to say cheers and shot."
4,good product - poor instructions,"It took me a bit to figure out how to set this product with my Canon 20Da for astrophotography purposes. The reason: the instruction manual is poor. Otherwise, the product works great, and the battery lasts for many months."
3,"The bad: International Warranty, too expensive, I want more control","Would you like to send a product back if it stopped working properly? Well, if you are in the USA, the International Warranty isn't going to help you.Intervalometers should be built into the camera but they aren't (well, more cameras are starting to do this) and so Canon charges an arm and a leg for a counting device.I shouldn't have to work around the fact that I want to take more than 99 photos without reseting the device. It should be easy to select how many photos you want at what interval you want. But it's not like that."
4,Just works,"I'm probably not saying anything new here... but it works as advertised, and would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't so overpriced. And good luck if you want to buy the even more overpriced cable extension. Once you figure out how to use it, (the rotating wheel is also a clickable button), it's easy enough to work. And for the fools that are complaining about how you can't turn it off... you don't need to, it's like a digital watch, it stays on for like 3 years. Oh, and you can do infinite captures, you just have to set the count to ""00""... not sure why they don't advertise that or explain it in the manual."
4,I'm a Fan,"It does what it's suppose to. There are some oddities to this thing though. One of them is that you can't turn it off. Since I don't use it all the time, I just take the battery out. It's easy to do and takes less than 8 seconds. The second thing is that if you want to take 500 pictures at a time using the time lapse feature, you have to set it to ""0"" photos. It only goes up to 99. This is ""ok"" I guess, but that means I have to keep an eye on the number of images it's taken, or do some math and figure out when 500 photos at 5 second intervals will finish (which is fine too). Just a bit of an unneeded extra step."
1,Knock-off sent,"Opened up the package only to find, after having ordered a genuine Canon TC-80N3 (and paying the genuine price for it, I might add) that I had a Chinese knock-off that I could buy anywhere for $20. To make matters worse, when I initially tried to return it, the website declared it unreturnable. This was resolved with a call to customer service, but the necessity for having to do that in the first place is seriously irritating."
3,"Nice try, but ...","Mike de Wolf somehow falls down the rabbit hole and becomes a character in abook by a hack author. Unfortunately, the character is a nasty villain, quite unlikeMike in Real Life. A not-too-interesting premise, but Hubbard comes up with a cute twist.You see, Mike, playing cruel Miguel de Lobo in the pulp novel, fights against the cruel straitjacket of fate that is the plot of the book being written. Not just fighting for his life, but also struggling to break out of type by trying to be an enlightened mid-20th-century man and treating his fellow characters with fairness and consideration. Not wanting to rape and pillage as the Typewriter in the Sky demands!Hubbard probably didn't have this in mind, but it certainly has broader implications, such as whether we readers, Characters in Real Life, can break outof the mold and become better persons than Fate has shaped us to be. Elron Hubbardcertainly tried -- not content to be a lowly pulp writer he founded his own religion."
4,Good For A Laugh,"It is truly a shame that L. Ron Hubbard will likely be remembered only for Dianetics. The truth is this. He was one of the greatest writers of science fiction ever published. Books like Battlefield Earth are a testament to the talent of this man. And then there is Typewriter In The Sky. This is a magnificently funny book! The lead character, Mike de Wolf, finds himself transported into a novel being written by a friend. Here he is known as Miguel de Lobo and he quickly learns that he is not to be cast as the hero. Knowing that the villain must die in the end Mike has to find some way to stay alive in a world that is chock full of anachronisms and stereotypes. He must find a way to outsmart the author who is unknowingly guiding his fate. And he must do it while staying within the parameters of the character he has been cast into. This is a great book and very much worth the cover price."
2,"A joke, writer vs character","A real world person is caught in a character in a short novel by L Ron Hubbard at the same time as he writes it. He is abducted into the story - how? we really dont know. Sometimes he hears the typewriter clicking away; and sometimes not - then he has some freedom from the writer's plot to try and influence it. The novel is a pirate story 500 years ago written in the style of 1940 pulp, a kind of a parody, including in the start a funny scene about writer and publisher relation - but not an interesting story.The pirate story itself is outdated and the good idea of the modern charater in the historic person, trying to free himself from the bonds of the writer, never really takes off. Hubbard was a very productive writer and did not think twice about what he wrote, so the theme is not folded out. A shame, it is a good idea. - Nothing about Scientology which came later."
5,Excellent choice for faith based biz ppl,This book gives excellent advice to any believer wanting to start a business whether if be faith based or not. The three pastors in this book all speak from experience and have healthy churches and businesses to back them. If you get the chance to read this book you'll highlight your life away and want to read it more than once. it has helped me dramatically and I highly recommend it.
1,90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back!,"After the first two movies in the series, which were pretty decent, I thought that was all there was. Howver, sometime later, I discovered that there was another film made, this one. However, I never had the chance to see it, either on tv, or on dvd.Now, I know why. This piece of garbage is horrible! Save yourself the money and time and just skip it. Little action, insipid humor, just plain BAD!"
2,Cheap Seats with even cheaper CRAP!!,"Oh CRUD! Is this a baseball movie or a Japan documentary? If this was supposed to be a baseball movie of little league kids, they should have put a little more baseball in it. I like the humor however. But without Tanner and Lupus, the humor is dry. It's just plain garbage! I wish that they would get the TV series out on video too!! It beats the crud out of this one!!"
1,They shouldn't have played this extra inning.,"The original ""Bad News Bears"" was great. ""BNB Breaking Training"" was okay. But ""BNB Go To Japan"" was enough to justify the attack on Pearl Harbor!"
2,disappointing,"Overall, the feel of the whole set is coarse, even after washing and fabric softener. They might really be made of 100% cotton, but they sure don't feel comfy.The amazon.com info is incorrect, in that the comforter is way too big to be crammed into the home washer. In fact, the label on the comforter clearly states that large commercial washer/dryer should be used. I tried to squeeze it into one commercial washer in our building, but failed. Now how am I supposed to use it w/o washing it first?"
4,"Good album, another great Canadian artist on the rise","This is the only Jason McCoy album I have now. Ever since the local country radio station played his single ""Still"", Ive decided to give this a try. It's not my favourite song on the album, but its good enough to draw me towards listening to his other tracks. His previous work is yet to be discovered. This artist deserves more attention than he currently gets. Rock on Jason, keep up the good work!"
1,Melitta Malady,"As a follow up to an earlier positive review, my unit lasted 16 months and no longer heats. I thought it might happen but not so quick. Never had one quit that soon in 25 years of owning 4 predecessors; a couple with hi watt elements."
3,Best Quality But Problems,"My goal was to find a home brewer that will heat the water hot enough to get good extraction. This is the hotest (fastest) I've found but has so many issues, it is tuff to recomend it. I basically have bought a new one every 18 mths. The 6 cups quantity I usually make tastes so good I'v been able to everlook all of the problems. Maybe the price being so cheap has influenced me too.Problems:1) It overflows when making 12 cups at almost any grind. So, if you make 4 - 8 cups, your fine.2) The warmer plate ""warps"" after a while. This could be because the auto drip shut-off leaks, most of the time.3) Auto drip shut-off - leaks."
2,Buy this if you like weak coffee.,"I am disappointed with this coffee maker. The lid on the carafe is hard to remove. The coffee is weak. I use a lot more coffee than I did with my old coffee pot, and still cannot get a decent brew."
2,what a mess,"This unit worked great. Then, after a couple of weeks the off / on light stopped working all of the time. The worse part however is the spring that holds up the cone to let the coffee drip into the pot is not srong enough to use 2-3 times a day. So now if your not careful the cone floods and lets coffee grinds and water into the pot undrinkable. What a mess to clean all of those grounds everywhere."
5,Can't get enough of these Webkinz!,"It is so hard to find these Webkinz now in the stores. Even I love playing the games, feeding the pet, etc. I ask my kids if they want help getting Webkinz dollars so I can enjoy playing, too. Love it! My kids love it!"
3,Good Book,"This book has some interesting ideas for gifts. Its publishing date is 1998 which sounds pretty recent but I did not come across a single online address to buy things...lots of 800 numbers though. I won't actually be putting this book into heavy use until December, so I am hoping the numbers are still current. Although I am a fan of Ms. Spizman's work in general, I have to say, I think that the other gift book I ordered (The Perfect Gift: The Ultimate Guide) has many more ideas and many more unique ideas. The Perfect Present is pretty and would make a great gift to give to someone!"
5,"IMHO, the best discussion of Patanjali","Having read the works of Georg Feuerstein and Swami Satchidananda, this is my third foray into the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and I would have to rate this as the best of the lot. This is not to denegrate the fine works of Feuerstein and Satchidananda; I simply prefer the work by Swami Hariharananda and I highly recommend it. For someone new to the subject, Hariharananda is quite informative, with lots of background information."
3,spirit,"Had to give this only 3 stars although it may deserve 5 I don't know, I couldn't get through it."
3,"It could be better, but . . . .","I've seen the premis for this anime a number of times but mostly in American movies and TV. The 1st episode is a bit slow to get going but after that things do improve. This could turn into gushy & annoying or things could get better as the series progresses. It was good enough to make me want to see more but only ""just""."
3,There are better sicence books,"Wanted to add this book to my home schooling collection, however the reviews and test questions are, at times, incomplete or not even there. The book is good otherwise and the information is solid. The section on chemistry was very good."
4,Great Music,"We love to listen to cocktail music while we are making dinner or socializing with friends, and this is a great listen. Some of the songs are so-so, but overall I would recommend it. You deserve it, the music is fun."
4,Old music new for me,"I bought this on a whim as I have some of the other Ultra-Lounge CDs. I thought some of the songs were a bit corny, but hey, that's what they did then. THere are some that I really liked and would love to see a current artist sing.Overall I enjoyed hearing music from some top notch old school artist and a classic composer's music.M"
3,Addi info on the lineage of Richard Vernon Freeman (1918-2008),"Richard Vernon Freeman is also descended from James Freeman, minister for 40+ years at King's Chapel in Boston. James is known for being the first preacher (in America) to label himself a Unitarian."
4,Highly Recommended !,"Owen writes an interesting story told from several views, about an elderly man reflecting on the past and his indiscretions. The tale is rewarding and emotional...an excellent book!"
4,Lalanne is existence proof of the wisdom of his preachings,"Good book, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in living a longer happier life."
2,Insipid and lackluster telling of the Helen Myth.,It's amazing to me that a legend of such wonderful and epic fascination has been reduced to this insipid and lackluster novel. Margaret George has squandered all the opportunities available to her to tell this tale in a compelling way. She has instead bored me to tears with her version of Helen's life.
4,"Accurate, beautiful and very educational","This as the first book I have read by George, and because of this book, I recently ordered her book on Cleopatra.This book is not only enjoyable on a surface level, when cross-examining it with other books on Greek mythology such as The Illiad, it all checks out, which makes this an educational read as well.Putting the character in a position where the reader sees his or her emotional struggles, allowed me to absorb more of the ""factual"" information without even realizing it. (I put factual in quotations because after all, the story of Helen of Troy is classed as myth)I am taking a greek/roman history class in college this semester, and will be calling upon this book in class dicussions.One of the most educational and enjoyable books I have read."
4,"Wonderful Novel, Brilliant!","This novel was beautifully crafted and clearly the author knows her subject matter. I felt like I had been transported back time to Troy. Helen's voice was so real, and she is brought to life in this novel. You cry when she cries, and you are happy when she is happy. I loved reading about Helen's childhood and how she came to be the wife of Menelous and queen of Sparta. I found all of the characters to be three dimensional beings and interesting. The one thing that I did not quite believe was how quickly Helen and Paris's love came. I get that Aphrodite intervened but it was still a plot hole in my opinion. I do not think that anybody could fall in love with somebody that quickly and leave their entire life behind for a man they barley know. I soon began to love the couple, so it was not such a big deal after a while. This is an amazing novel that is worth the read. I wish it had been longer!"
2,"poetic, yet boring","Ms. George write very poetic, yet I found the book quite boring. I did listen to the unabridged audio version and the reader is wonderful (Justine Eyre) and thanks to her reading,I was able to get through ALL the CD's. If you're interested in a better version, I'd suggest: The Memoirs of Helen of Troy: A Novel by Amanda Elyot. I'm still HOPING for an audio version of this book."
4,"Not bad, but not great","Not bad. Not the greatest book in the world, either. My favorite Margeret George book is still ""Memoirs of Cleopatra"". Hard to top that one."
3,It's average,"This book is not bad but it's really nothing special. although the tale is far more involved than most of us knew, the author is often lomgwinded about things that are not as important to the story. the sudden moments of ""magical"" thimgs happening just seem silly. i did enjoy reading about the mythical helen's life before troy and after, however. just not the best book ever."
4,Helen of Troy,"Margaret George did an amazing job of weaving many Greek myths together in this entertaining book. I read it while taking a Classical Mythology class. The book was not an assignment, just a coincidence. Helen of Troy made everything make sense! So much of my previous education about Greek myths was either boring or confusing, and this book was neither. I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, Greek mythology, and a good story!"
5,Great Story,"Although I knew the story, this book was a great journey and kept me entertained to the point where I could not put it down!The author creates a lovely portrait of life in ancient times in which you weep for the characters. In the end although my heart broke for the inevitable, I felt fulfilled."
2,how can they have been so stupid?,"I absolutely loved Margaret George's first (?) book, ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII"" and also applauded ""The Memoirs of Cleopatra"", but I am beginning to think she had only one good book in her. I have read all the others and was disappointed in each. In order to finish ""Helen of Troy"" (for a book review) I had to skim mightily through the final 200 pages. How could these Trojans have been so stupid? They couldn't recognize the spy among them even though the reader does early on? They REALLY thought the wooden horse was a gift and not a trap? Oh, please.Helen and Paris are self-aggrandizing, spoiled children who care only for themselves. I wanted to slap her as soon as she stepped on the ship to Troy. Don't waste your time on this one, there are far too many much better historical fiction books to read. Try all of Beverly Swerling's work. They are exceptionally fine."
2,HOW TO RUIN A GOOD STORY,"The basic story is fascinating, but George has expanded it beyond belief. Long, useless passages abound. Flowery descriptions of every possibe venue,and adjectival overkill make this basically intriguing tale into a never ending bore. One tolerates pages of unnecessary prose in the hope of coninuing the central theme. I assume that the author is striving for a ""big book"". but achieves a fatally overwritten tome."
1,A clumsy retelling of a gloriously epic tale,"A clumsy and incomplete retelling of an otherwise gloriously epic classic tale. George cannot decide what types of personalities her characters have -- is Paris vain and immature, clinging onto Helen, or is he strong and manly? Has only a few years elapsed since Helen left Sparta or was it 20? Is Helen committed to Paris and her new course or is she torn? Very difficult to build relationships or understand any of the characters -- none are endearing, even though one may be tempted to feel sorrow for the fate of Andromache and her young son at the end. Poorly written. George does not do her subject matter justice in this case."
5,Helen / Troy,"I am so very impressed with the speed this book made it into my hands. I believe I had it in less than a week. The condition of the book is excellent, price is great & delivery cannot be beat. Great customer service. Thank you.."
3,"Long and good, but not great","I found this book to be terribly long - with the emphasis on terribly. It really dragged for me, and although I enjoyed it in parts, I never really loved this book, as I did George's books about Mary Magdalene and Henry VIII.George did not give us a character we could identify with - but maybe that is the essence of Helen of Troy and Paris. They were very selfish people who tried to disregard the reality of how their lives were affecting everyone else. Or maybe they did care, as George so frequently tells us, if fate had meant it to be, there was nothing they could do about it. Ah ha, another Greek Tragedy.I would give this a 3 spears out of 5."
5,Excellent!!!,"When reading historical fiction, I always feel as though I'm reading something more substantial then just plain fiction. This is one of the best books I have read this year. Don't let the size of the book intimidate you - the story flow nicely and before you know it you'll be close to the end. You won't be able to put it down!!"
5,One of the best,This is one of the best books that I have read in awhile --- mesmerizing and quick --- great example of historical fiction by one of the best authors around.
5,Good Bargain,"Seriously, if you are an Inuyasha fan and you want it in English,get this version of the second season. I would highly recommend also buying the first season in the English TV version if you like this version. It's straight to the point, its cheap and I love it. Its a pity that the other seasons don't come in this version. This version has saved me alot of money."
2,Will the real Cipe please stand up?,"Cipe Pineles was someone I had heard much about but knew very little of her work or history. I've come away from reading this book feeling that Cipe must have been charming and idiosyncratic, but I still don't feel I know much about her or her design philosophy. She comes across as almost disdainful of the work she is best known for, designing and art directing women's fashion magazines. It's also written a bit dryly with some confusing back-and-forth of events. Don't forget your magnifying glass; the examples of her design work are presented not much larger than thumbnails! In all, not worth the steep price and not, I fear, the definitive insight and appreciation of Cipe Pineles."
3,Design God Alert!,"If Paul Rand was the grandfather of American graphic design, then Cipe Pineles is the grandmother! That alone is a great reason to make sure you have a copy of this book in your reference library if you are an art director or just love great editorial design. The writing in the book is great and goes into detail, but the real flaw is that you only get to see tiny thumbnails of her design work. While this gives you a good taste of her style, it leaves you hungry wanting to see more. But until more books are done on Cipe (pronounced See-Pea), this book is a must have."
2,Such fascinating material - but the typesetting made for a VERY difficult read,"Every time I try to read this book, I get a headache. I'm so upset with the people who produced this book because they set it in a font that has too much contrast between that thick and thin lines of the font, making it very difficult to read!I'm fascinated by Ms. Pineles, and would really like to read about her. I enjoy the images of her work in the book. I only wish she could have been around to art direct this work.I'd love to get a digital version of the book so that I could set it in a more readable font."
1,A flawed product,I'm returning this product. I couldn't get out the starting gate because of poor documentation. It was very unclear how to transfer maps from a PC to a Palm T3 SD Card. Other reviewers point out that you can't do address lookups on the PDA which limits the usefullness of this package. I was planning to use this software with Delorme's Earthmate GPS receiver. I'm now looking at the TomTom T3 GPS offering instead.
1,Crashes when you try to make a route! Worthless!,"I have the 2005 version. It is worthless. It will not allow you to route from current GPS position to a point. And...when you try to map a shortest or quickest route, the system freezes after up to 5 minutes of ""thinking"" the computation. The software is only effective at routing for very short routes. Anything I tried over 10 miles would take at least 5 minutes to compute. And I'm using a newer HP Ipaq with plenty of memory. This software stinks. If you buy a GPS go with some other software."
3,The Pills Won't Help You Now,"This album is not the duo's best effort. They had a lot of keyboards, samples and vocals on this record which would leave you scratching your head. They have too many collaborations on this album which are not that great. ""Do It Again"" is a great track with Ali Love which had charted in the UK top 20. From ""Saturate"" through ""A Modern Midnight Converstation"" are stand outs. Everything else on this record doesn't stand out very well. The iTunes only bonus track, ""Seal"" is great and should have been on the album. These following B-sides, ""Clip Kiss"" and ""No Need"" also are great and should have been the album. The remixes for ""Do It Again"" are better than the album version. In my honest opinion, this album is alright and it could have been a tad bit better."
3,"An odd turn for the band, and they mostly pull it off","The Chem Bros seem to be developing a wry sense of humor with several tracks here. The Salmon song is intentionally silly but I have to confess I've hummed along to it a few times. A lot of people are gonna hate that track so I have to wonder why its there at all. Several tracks are also digital throwbacks to ""simpler"" 80's beats and that is not neccessarily a bad thing. The band is channeling early Prince on at least 2 of the tracks. Is it worth buying? That's a hard question because half of the tracks arent really memorable. Best to check out the audio previews of the tracks before you buy. I've always been a fan of the band but they seem a bit rudderless the last several CD's."
4,"Yes, You Are the Night","There are not so many bands in the musical panorama which, after releasing a singles' collection of a decade of existence, have made out 2 great new albums just after it. As many do, I really enjoy ""Push the Button"" but for me this album is almost capable of matching with it... and I must confess I was not expecting that. Yes, songs like ""We Are the Night"", ""Das Spiegel"" or ""Burst Generator"" are the night! Go for it fans, the formula is as good as ever."
2,Oh yeah... now I remember why I stopped listening to them,"I loved Exit Planet Dust. I loved Dig Your Own Hole. I loved Surrender. I didn't love Come With Us and I didn't love Push the Button. So I stopped there. That was a few years ago. Recently something made me want to pick up where I left off, so I picked up a copy of We Are the Night. No doubt about it, these guys ran out of awesome sauce years ago. There is absolutely no spark in any of these tracks. None at all. Yet another case of ""What are we supposed to do now? Sell insurance?"" ""Nah. Let's just keep putting out records."" ""But... we're obviously out of juice."" ""Eh, enough people won't notice that we'll still be able to make a living.""That said, I'm only a few tracks into the follow up album Further and I can already they were able to somehow get a sauce refill."
4,delicious,"The Chems are always hit and miss. Plus they always have a couple different styles going on, but I think they more hit than miss here. I'm more for the repetitive looping and some are more for the block rockin' beats. My absolute favorite here is Das Spiegal. So intoxicating and fun and so many layers going on in there. It was incredible live! They are incredible live. Even if you think they are just okay, go to the live show."
2,A bad way for me to get to know the Chemical Brothers,"Ok, I just got the cd so MAYBE it will grow on me but for some reason I am not too sure about that. I had high expectations for this release, I have always hear Chemical Brothers songs and to be honest none of them really grabbed me until 'Do It Again'. Being the loyal cd buyer that I am I bought this disk and found it to be rather lackluster, it doesnt flow very well and the tracks just seem kind of thrown together. Maybe I need to keep listening to it but all in all I am not impressed, I really hate writing negative reviews but I cant seem to find anymore then 3 SOLID songs on this disk. To be fair I will buy an older cd of theirs."
1,Insulting,"Up until now CB have been one of my top groups. They've got some great stuff out there. This album is worse than I can really verbalize, so I won't try so hard (just like they didn't try with it). Go to youtube and check out the salmon dance. If you can watch that and tell me it sounds good to you, by all means get this, but I haven't found the hamster dance funny since the 90's and it is about as good. I am 100% positive that much of the support of this is just because it's by CB. If it was their first album, they'd never have gained any traction at all with it and for no other reason than that it is horrendously unenjoyable and amateurish."
1,WTF,Saturate was pretty good. The rest of the album seams to be some desperate plea to become unpopular.
2,Joe and Jason do it not to well,"think this is dem, joe and jason chemical. why else would they be called chemical brothers right? Like Allman brothers yeah! I think the real question with this CD is the following: Do they have My Chemical Romance in mind? haha I am so funny, but then it plays into the question of chemical warfare and I doubt that the who-sane guy listened to these guys you know it? The one song I really like is the first song but after that it is just a lot of beeping noises. I think I should go into music becuz I can record my answering machine and make noises with my blender in the background and scream and yeah call it like a project album yeah. Best to listen to when eating pepperjack cheese with Dorito chips that are Nacho flavored yo!"
1,Don't think I'll buy it!!,This is NOT the Chemical Bros. that I know of!!! What the hell happened??? This whole album blows!! Thank god for the preview or else I would have to add another album to the stack of dust collectors and paperweights!! Listen at your own risk!!!
3,Losing their heart,"Although the production is impressive and on point, this album lacks character and direction. It almost feels more like a random compilation of tracks that never really goes anywhere or says anything. They evidently tried to emulate some current club and dance music styles, but it somehow feels forced. Do It Again could be a decent late 2000s house/techno anthem if it weren't for the cheap, horribly annoying ""paint my face and bang my drum"" bridge section, which sounds lazy and throws the whole song out of character. This sort of thing happens with most of the songs. Three stars for the edgy, talented audio production, but that's about it. Sorry guys."
5,The best Chmical Brothers album since Surrender,"After a couple of disappointing albums (Follow Me, Push the Button) The Chemical Brothers have really hit a winner here. The album is most similar to Surrender, so if you liked that one I can guarantee you will like this album.The majority of the album has an almost melancholy feel to it, up until the Salmon Dance. I know a lot of people think that this song is out of place, and it is, but that is the reason I like it so much. It breaks up the album, and puts a smile on my face every time I hear it.While I would say that We Are the Night is as strong as the group's first three albums, it's close enough. One of my favorite albums of the last two years."
1,Inaccurate,"I found this book to be full of inaccurate statements and misinformation. Right at the start the NJ State Police ""era"" is incorrect. Bigtwin H-D fatbob tanks were never used for oil and then gasoline as stated. They were always used for gasoline. Only the 45 utilised one fatbob for oil and the other for fuel. This is just two examples."
3,Not bad.,Copeland applies the Dake-Bonoist scriptures to modern day life. He Quotes the King James Version and the Rev. Finis Dake's Dake Study Bible. He's not afraid to grapple with the thoughts of modern secular artists and musicians. He follows the lyrics of U2 and Bono strictly in outlining his exposition on modern american spirituality. He adopts Dake-Bonoist exegetical methods in his exposition of the biblical texts.
5,All around awesome book,I couldn't put it down. I read it in a day. A must-read for any animal lover. It's my favorite book. I can't wait until I'm old enough to volunteer. It inspired me to work at an animal shelter. I recommend this book to any one who has ever felt the love of a pet.
4,Wonderfully uplifting read!,"If you love animals, you'll love this book. It made my laugh and it made me cry. Having worked with the author as a volunteer at the Animal Rescue Center at the Placer County Fairgrounds during the northern California floods of 1997, I could really identify with the emotions the author experienced during her rescue efforts at many of our nations other disasters. Very compelling - I didn't want to put it down. When I finished reading I felt good for having spent the time, and I think you will too"
5,"Wrenches your Heart, GIVES YOU HOPE IN HUMANITY","Exceptional Book. It tugs at your heart strings. The description of her work, the environment, its AS THOUGH YOU WERE THERE WITH HER, CHEERING HER ON, WORKING WITH HER..How can there possibly ever be a better book than this?THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND in its genre.BREATH-TAKINGLY written FROM THE HEART"
2,A bit misguided!,"Terri Crisp is a dinosaur and hopefully she has been replaced by more enlightened people. She randomly euthenized every feral cat she came across, proclaiming that ferals are not adoptable and are basically a scurge. Obvioulsy she has never heard of T.N.R. programs. I was very disappointed in this book and in Crisp's actions and can only hope people will NOT use it as a guide to animal welfare. It is just one uneducated womens accounts of her exploits."
5,An incredible book...an incredible woman,"As a wildlife rehabilitator, I can relate to Ms. Crisp's love and devotion to animals. She is my hero and an incredible human being. The book is well written. I have read it twice and I cried just as hard the second time as I did the first. Truly inspirational."
1,Not Good,This product did nit work when I received it. I in no way attribute it to the seller. I got in touch with the actual comapny that made it. They were gratious and refunded my payment.
4,alright i guess,"my mom actually found these in some store for much cheaper idk whereshe bought it for our old living room computeri like these things, no complaints about it except that the cord that connect the speaker to your pc is very short (like 1 foot) and that pretty much ruins alot of things. also the led doesnt just light up to sound, vibrations as wellwhen my little brother bounces the ball in the room they light up, pretty cool (and the led can be turned off, fyi)"
4,Review Haiku,Review in the form of a haiku:It's a batteryIt will power your gadgetsOne I got worked fine
4,Been using this coffeemaker for over a month now,"When the first coffeemaker arrived, there was a problem with the circuit board (wouldn't stay on)and it had to be returned. the second one arrived and it took a full 48 hours for the atomic clock to connect to daylight savings time. Other than that, REALLY like the shape of the carafe, doesn't drip. Cone filters, with removable holder for the filter. The coffee brews very quickly and makes very good coffee. I only wish it had a removable water resevoir rather than having to fill it from the carafe."
4,Great Headphones,I looked long and hard for TV headphones and for the price and features these were the best. I like the long cord and the inline volume control. I like the fact there is no battery to deal with. The sound quality is great. I even use them when I watch movies on my computer.
1,parent90,The head set sound was good/The cord is ridiculously long and get in the way. The head set stopped working in one ear phone within one month of purchase. Very poor product. I bought it to go with the philips mp3 player for my daughter. The mp3 player is great not the headset.
2,Where's the noise?,I was hoping for a decent pair of headphones but with the sound all the way up it wimps out and doesn't drown out much background noise...also while the extra log cord can be handy if I need to listen to my stereo across the room it can be a pain hauling that cord around.
4,Use for trips,"we go on cruises and my husband like to stay up and watch, when I want to sleep, they make both of us happy. the cord is long enough for almost all our trips. it has volume control which others do not. thank you"
3,OK,"I purchased these headphones for use with my TV and computer. I'm not really using them for music but for my intended use the sound quality is fine. I cannot seem to get the volume, or rather loudness that I want with the volume control. Other than that, they are comfortable to wear. Since volume is a concern, I could only give a three star rating."
2,Decent but not comfortable or durable,"The earpieces are connected to the band with thin plastic, and they are so tight around your head that they start to break off eventually. I am going to have to try gluing mine before they break off completely. I also had to wrap paper towels around the top of the band, so that the plastic wasn't pressed against my head. And again they are very tight on the sides, but the band is still above my head so they slide down. It is very awkward and hardly adjustable at all. I do love the extra long cord and the volume control is nice."
2,uncomfortable,"The headband has no padding and after a few minutes of wearing, these headphones get very uncormfortable due to the hard plastic being in contact with the top of your head even if you move it forward or back. Unless you are sideshow bob, dont go near these!"
2,"Once bitten, twice shy","I've owned two pairs of these headphones. I listen to music most of the day while I work and wanted headphones which would be comfortable for extended use, keep the sound in (rather than forcing my co-workers to listen to Underworld), and last a while. The first pair lasted me around 8-9 months before the plastic on one side snapped at the adjustable joint. Using some tape I rigged them up to work a while longer, only to have the other side snap. My second pair lasted almost as long and broke in the exact same manner. I won't be wasting my money on another pair."
2,"Good price, but I won't buy them again.","Those headphones were great and much more comfortable than most of the full head-size headphones. They cover your ears entirely, and don't become uncomfortable or cause you pain even after hours of use. For the price and the quality, I would recommend it for all of those who need headphones occasionally. For those who usually wear it a lot though, I'd recommend you to buy some more expensive headphones. These will not last long. They were my third pair of headphones in one year, and now I'm done with buying $50-less headphones. I treat them well and do nothing but keep them on my head all day. Still, they all tend to break around the same spot if you wear them too much: the regulator strap just breaks, and you get stuck with a one-sided broken headphone. That's why I'm not getting headphones with plastic straps anymore. If you have the choice, go with rubber, metal, whatever floats your boat and doesn't appear as breakable."
3,Disappointed,I got these mainly for the volume control & sound but both were disappointing. I'll store them & keep an eye out for a better set. I will probably have to pay quite a bit more for the sound quality I'm looking for. I presently have a set of JVCs that have provided me quite good sound quality for many years though they have no volume control.
3,Good heaphones for the price,Good for the price. Long cord is ok. The jack is not gold-plated so the sound is not that great. I need to pump up the volume of my MP3 player so I can use the volume controls on the wired headphone.
1,Problems with SHP2500/37,The right side head phone did not work since I opened the package.Another piece of junk from China produced for Philips! Now I am stuck with a product which I can't use and now I am figuring out how to get a replacement from Amazon as I was gone out of the country for 30 days. With this product I bought a Sennheiser ( again Made in China) and it works good. German quality better than Dutch. Avoid Philips product at all costs
5,Happy.,These headphones came quickly and are working just as I'd hoped. They're comfortable although perhaps a little big for my head. I'm glad they're adjustable. I also like having the volume control on the cord close to the headphones.
2,Weak sound,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong here but I can turn my TV volume up to about 30 and I can hear the TV over the headphones!! (I normally listen to the TV on 17-20) But then when I plug the headphones into my laptop there is plenty of good sound and solid base. It's a little hissy but whatever.Hopefully someone can help me figure out how to make the sound level output from the TV to the headphones a little higher. (yes, I tried the volume control on the cord) If not, these headphones are useless. I will literally throw them in the trash."
5,Outstanding Philip Catherine with an outstanding BJO!,"Until now, I knew Philip Catherine mostly from playing his superb guitar music in a trio or quartet(from his albums and live concerts). I did not believe my ears when I heared that great big band sound from the Brussels Jazz Orchestra embracing Philip's guitar playing. Bert Joris, fantastic trumpet player, rearranged Philip's exquisite compositions('Letter from my mother' among others) and Frank Vaganée(alto saxophone) conducted the big band: the result is unique! 'A 'Got to have one ' for every jazz guitar lover!"
1,dead on arrival,"I bought mine from an outfit in Ohio that specializes in harmonicas. Same story, mine arrived looking like someone sat on it. the top and bottom covers were pushed in. about half of the notes that are ""draw"" notes in the middle of the instrument would not play at all along with some in the high register. I contacted the service dept. at Hohnerand got the same story, can't return it. They were skeptical suggesting that I had damaged it by playing it improperly.Skip this harmonica."
3,Make a good wall decoration,"By looking the image, I expected a stunning work of art. When I recived it, I was bit disappointed to see that the finish is not that great. The pieces are not weighted and hence, I do not concider is a good playing board and pieces. However, it looks great on the wall."
2,Disappointing Design,"Overall I am disappointed with the design of this chess set. The board and pieces feel disproportionate to each other - the board could be quite a bit smaller and has a lot of useless artwork that just increases it's size. The fence along the outer edge serves as a frame if you are planning on hanging it (I have infinitely better pieces of art to hang on my walls), but is rather inconvenient during play as pieces set along it's inside edge encroach upon the playing area so it unduly increases the size of the board. Also, the pieces seem swallowed up by the squares and, as another reviewer noted, are not weighted properly. I gave the item two stars because it does work for playing chess, however if I was in a retail store looking at game boards I would pick the $5.00 plastic ""made in china"" option over this."
4,Good alternative to collagen product.,"I was looking for the FaceLift moisturizer with collagen. Looks like the FDA has classified collagen as a drug so it can't be sold over the counter in moisturizers? Found this product after searching online. While not as good as the original product with collagen, it is a good alternative (although more expensive). Noticeably smooths fine lines and wrinkles on first use. Overtime it lightens skin discolorations. You'll see a definite difference when you use this product."
3,Not quite,"This item may be good for people with dry, ashy skin as the mixed formulation becomes too oily in my estimation. No 'botox' effect so far. The sellers responded quickly and positively when I had a delivery issue."
5,Love it!,"Everything a beginner could want and need. My friend who has been working with guns for a number of years liked it so much he ordered one as well. Wood box a little cheap, but who cares, it is a nice looking box though."
3,Cyrill Robinson A history of Greece,"Lightweight reading. Robinson is more interested in prose than in content. Perhaps this is because at the time he wrote there was insufficient source material or it could have been intentional. In any event, if you want to read prose that is pretty but lacks detail that someone deeply interested in the subject matter, then this book is for you. If you aspire an in depth book that cross references to Herodotus and Theucidides as well as to Plutarch and others and compares and contrasts the above then this book won't fill the bill."
1,Three love stories,"Up till now the story has mainly focused on Goh and Anna, Vol 5 is all about the other pilots in the first volume. Vasconia, her Servant, and their relationship, She hates the way he never has an opinion of his own, but the truth is serving her with all his heart is the only way he feels he can show his love. Genesister are two Girl pilots that love each other and, they KNOW its considered Taboo to be in love and wish they were opposite sexes, but Luna spends most of the episode Anguishing over that problem. They don't actually have sex, so it can't really be called hentai. Finally team GodDinner becomes engaged, and invites Goh and Anna to the wedding If you bought the first 5 volumes for the crazy relationships than this is right up your alley. Even thou the story with Goh and Anna is in the background for now, there is still a lot of Giant Robot fighting, and you get to see their powers."
5,The canine spirit is revealed in fact and history,"Dog Spirit provides a focus on the different roles dogs and their relatives have played in the religious and magical traditions of societies around the world. Astrological guidelines are presented for determining a dog's personality, chapters examine their participation in spiritual ceremonies and celebrations, and the canine spirit is revealed in fact and history."
2,Okay for Junior High School,"But not for an adult. Many, many errors, lots of clipart illustrations, general bunkum. I'm returning it to Amazon for a refund (and I never go to that trouble!).I suppose if I'd read about the other books she'd written, I never would've made this mistake.Better - get yourself a canine companion, and learn from her!"
3,Weird but worth the time,This wasn't the best or worst mystery I've ever read. I rate it right down the middle. If you don't have anything else to read give it a try for yourself. I haven't checked any other books out by this author.
4,Good mystery!,"Great suspense! If I didn't need to sleep, I never would have put it down. Recommended to any mystery lover. Morgan was so strong and yet vulnerable. The evil was so scary.My only problem was the proofreading. I can't imagine printing a book with so many errors in the text."
5,The Autobiography and Sex Life of Andy Warhol,"This is a fun book of interviews with the people who hung out/worked with Andy by John Wilcock who had access to them and hung out/worked with them too. Andy's sex life is still rather ambiguous, but John asks some good questions. If your into the Worhol scene you will enjoy the book."
1,Very Poor Quality Control,"My son was so excited to receive in the mail today his ""2-games-in-1"" set of checkers and tic-tac-toe. Guess what. The reverse of the board is blank - no Tic-Tac-Toe. Also, one of the white checkers is considerably thinner and without the spiral markings of the others. Finally, the board itself actually has a laminate surface (front and back), with painted-sides. The quality is so poor, there is actually paint all around the edges of the board with brush strokes well into the laminate playing surface. Hang on, let me look at the box...Ahah! Well, the box I received DEFINITELY does not have the ""SOLID WOOD CHECKERS & TIC TAC TOE"" label like in the Amazon listing. It simply has ""CHECKERS WOOD GAMEBOARD & PIECES"".Also:""MADE IN CHINA""""In an effort to continually improve our products, items may vary from those shown.""Ahh, it all makes sense now."
2,Sent it back,"I got this for my mom as a gift because she wanted to play checkers. However, the board was small and my mom (who is 74) advised me that the correct colors for a checker board are black and red. Not black and wood. So, this went back and I got her the old fashioned checker board instead. She loves the new one."
2,Did not fit as pictured,"This did not fit as pictured in the photo. The standard walker used by my mother has a corner brace that prevents the hook from attaching, so the basket it useless for her purpose. Save the packaging and try the basket after assembly so that you can return it if necessary; I didn't, so we are out the money and can't use the product."
4,Duro-Med No wire Basket-Gray,"I was having trouble finding a walker tray to fit my standard duro-med walker and therefore ordered this basket. Works good. Secure. Tall. Does not swing. Works better on straight walker bars compared to ones that curve. Easy to put on and assemble. Built in compartments a plus even though cup size limited-does not fit all cup sizes but cup size larger when compared to other baskets. (Cup size diameter is approx 3 inches.) Even though standard dishes/plates don't fit basket width easily (whereas other options not available, like walker trays not fitting) food can be transported easily in round, square or oblong microwaveable containers. Easy to clean/wash if spills occur. Made my life alot easier! Prompt shipping and arrival. Reasonable price."
3,not her best,"I really enjoyed The Hidden Life of Dogs but found this book disappointing. There's a lot more guesswork and very little in the way of true insight here. Worse, Liz goes way off the deep end in the last 1/4 or so of the book. Things like having a purebred dog, using a leash, neutering a male dog, etc. all put you into the ""dog fascist"" category. There are things you can do when you live in the woods, work at home and so on that don't make much sense in the urban or suburban areas where most of us live, and with the working lifestyles that most of us have to deal with. She needs to come down into the real world more often."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable read,"While I agree with other reviews I've read of this book, I don't think they convey how enjoyable the read is, nor how funny parts of it are. I find myself laughing out loud a lot. I think it is great, and I will certainly look at my dogs differently now."
2,Reflections & Dreams Review,"I'm a big Nora Roberts fan, but this one disappointed me. Her characters didn't seem real. Perhaps because it was based on the world of Ballet, which is foreign to me, her characters seemed one-dimensional. I understand this is s re-publication of an early book. Perhaps she hadn't honed her writing skills yet. In any case, it won't deter me from trying one of her novels again."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK FROM A GREAT AUTHOR!,"I have always enjoyed books from Nora Roberts and this one is no exception! Reflections and Dreams contains two stories - Reflections and Dance of Dreams and I find both great. Each story is about ballet dancers who eventually find love.This book has wonderful characters who are fully developed by the author. Every detail is described carefully and fans of Nora Roberts would find this trait familiar in many of her books. The characters are so described such that you actually feel like you know them. Personally, I prefer Nikolai to Seth but I find that I prefer the first story, Reflections to the second one. Nonetheless, kudos to Nora Roberts!"
4,A Good Light Read.,"I continue to enjoy Nora Roberts. This is one of her lighter stories. The depth of the characters in both books is on the lighter side. It's a great book for taking on a plane, bus or car ride or just need to escape the pressures of work. It gives you a wonderful glimpse into the world of ballet."
3,editor goof,"I agree with the other reviewers, the story lines for both books were enjoyable, however, a noticable goof in the first story destroyed the creditablity for me for the remaining bit of the first story and the second. The lead in the Nutcracker is ""Carla""!?! Please, even folks with a basic understanding of dance, like myself, know the main character is Clara, and for the most part, in most productions, Clara does not get the lead dance portions because that character is a child. I found myself questioning the quality of the background research for these books and this distracted me from the story."
4,loved the second story,"The first story was quite flat for me (3 stars) but I loved everything about the second one (5 stars)- Ruth and Nick were great. For me, this is Nora Roberts at her best."
3,"Pretty design, kind of clunky","Bought for my wife, who has very slender wrists. Had to bring it to a jeweler to remove more than the stand one. It looks pretty and she'll wear it with formal clothes, but it's too bulky and chinky looking for her."
2,"It's Okay, but this is LIGHT stuff","I've got all the Hed Kandi Disco Kandi compilations, as well as Disco Heaven and the other beach house.Perhaps a more appropriate term for (roughly speaking) these discs is ""background house""; this isn't stuff that's gonna fill the dance floor, but rather VERY unobtrusive, frequently Latin-tinged house lite that sounds good poolside.If you're looking for kickin' disco house jams for danceability, you should pretty much avoid the Beach House comps, although the other one has a couple of killer Latin-sounding, percussion-heavy tracks.Just a friendly warning..."
4,Hedkandi blasts the best with Beach House,"I recently purchased this CD and I am totally diggin' it. It is a great house album, with some inspired vocals. Unfortunately, some of the vocalists tend to take away from the tracks, rather than add to them. The album's largest downfall would be the mix of good and bunk vocalists. Overall though, I found this to be an enjoyable album, and I will continue to bust it thoughout the summer."
5,Oil Painting Secrets From a Master: 25th Anniversary Edition,This is an excellent source for any artist. Technique and concept are covered with great finesse. David Leffel is an exceptional artist and contemporary master.
4,Oil Painiting Secrets from a Master,I have been painting for many years. I found this book full of comments that reminded me of the things I should focus on and things I might try to make a better painting. An artist should never stop learning. This is a good one to add to your library. Len
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased Oil Painting Secrets from a Master and must say I was extremely disappointed, both with the written and the visual content. I own a number of art books from contemporary masters and have been painting for close to 20 years, and this is the only art book I own for which I would give such a criticism, so please be aware I do not say this lightly. Buyer beware."
3,Not for beginners,"This book focusses intially on the process of thinking that should be adopted while painting and during composition, which is quite helpful. The rest of the book are filled with tips on brushstroke, color, chiaroscuro, etc which are also occasionally educational. However, the tips are sometimes confusing and not very clearly articulated. The drawback of the book is that the quality of the prints are nor esp good and the tips, though sometimes helpful, are neither thorough nor are they put down in a very orderly manner. Some of the tips do not focus on the ""why"" of the same, but just that they should be adopted. If a person is looking for an in-depth technique book, this is not it. Intermediate painters, rather than beginners, would find this book to be of some help. But neither does this book contain any great inputs for artists who have already attained some degee of expertise."
4,Maddening Reproductions and Sketchy Notes of a great Artist,"David Leffel is my favorite modern realist, along with Richard Schmid. Unfortunately, he is not represented well by this book. All of the other reviewers have said it - too many of the reproductions are maddeningly out of focus, and most of the others are dull and unworthy. While there are valuable things to be learned from the text, it is from class notes and it really shows.The four stars are for the artist, whose work is the very best. There are some decent repros in the book and they are to be savored, and in my opinion make the book worth buying, although how Mr. Leffel and the publisher signed off on a production of this poor quality is a mystery."
5,Great Companion,"This book is extraordinarily helpful for artists who already have some experience. It appears to be a collection of class notes with many illustrations and helpful tips, rather than a mapped out ""method"". I discovered in it many missing links of information, ""ahas"", so to speak."
5,A worthy read,"The reproductions and comments by david leffel are excellent,I have picked up insights that will help greatly in my own painting.I(t is a book that will be constantly read and enjoyed.My only regret is that it is not a larger volume."
4,"Great book, but really for a certain style of painting","Good read and good study material but more fitting if you are into real loose and heavy brush stroke type of painting styles only. But does includes some pointers and info that anyone could learn from. The term Master in painting is used so loosely now days compared from when the term was coined and meant something so long ago. But to clarify, I am not downing the author, he is a great painter. Good book for any oil painters collection and or reference."
5,"Fascinating instruction, fascinating art","This book is worth it's price just to see the artwork. At the same time, I have learned a lot from the material in this book and I am inspired by the artist's work. You can tell he's mastered a technique unique to himself and his teaching methods are quite clear and informative. It's fun to see someone so talented who wishes to pass on that knowledge to others. I've read quite a few art improvement books but this one is different in that it really seems to get down to important fundamentals of art in a clear and instructive manner. I imagine I'll re-read it quite a bit as it has a lot of critical detail that I haven't run into before. It is obvious that this artist has great skill and insight and he uses an equal amount of those talents presenting clear and helpful information to those who strive to improve their art skill. I highly recommend this one to anyone with a serious desire to become an artist or who want to better understand real art."
5,art lessons are important to continued learning.,"Everytime an artist studies the masters, current or old masters, it is a chance to grow. It takes much practice and time to achieve good art. Do not be satisfied until you understand the skills required to do this."
3,Good information,"I don't see how you can give a 5 star rating to a book with such poor quality, out-of-focus reproductions. The book contains some great tips for the oil painter who is moving beyond the basics. Do yourself a favor and get this book from the library first. Then you will not be disappointed when you pay for a book that looks like it was photographed by my 7 year old."
2,A Dissenting Review,"The previous reviewers have been so glowing in their evaluations of this book that I feel compelled to dissent. I returned my copy after a few days because it fell way short of my expectations. I was first struck by the very poor quality of the reproducions: many are blurry to the point of distraction. And despite the opinion of one reviewer, I would caution a beginner to stay away from this book. Rather than an instructional, it is a series of notes culled from classes given by ""the master"", and it reads that way. Admittedly, much of the information contained in this book is valuable. But it is much more a collection of bon mots on oil painting than a systemmatic guide. If you are expecting that, you may enjoy it as much as some of the other reviewers. (Just don't expect great reproductions)."
5,"A very inspirational ""how-to begin"" guide to oil painting","This book is highly recommended for someone who has never had a painting instructor or been part of a painting class. Like ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" it is as much about how to SEE as how to paint. The tips and techniques are applicable even if your painting style differs greatly from the featured artist."
2,Bad quality of the shirt itself,"Very old school shirt- i.e., the old bad quality kind. Really thick and won't sit well on anyone because of the cheap shirt used."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered this shirt for my 16 year old son. I ordered grey which was designated as unisex, male & female size same. When I received it the shirt was definitely female by the length and cut of the shirt. Needless to say, my son and & I were disappointed and purchased the shirt from another site to avoid the same problem. Be aware. Seller returned item fine, but I lost out on shipping and time & aggravation."
2,This stars the wrong Anna Kendrick.,"If you think that you want to see this movie because Anna Kendrick is in it, think again. It stars Anna Kendrick is but it is not the same Anna Kendrick who is in ""Up in the Air"" but a different actress altogether. The movie is watchable, barely, with extremely poor production values, and is certainly not worth the present purchase price."
5,A nice surprise,"A very intersting and smart product inside the world of the chillout collection.It's not easy to define a proper identy in a large offer of chillout cd.Plush it's a brillant cd, well made in all aspect (very nice cover inside and outside), and in particular with the music.Each songs give almost the best of the single artists (for example : Wondabraa with Lately (parachute) or Alex Cortiz with Fingerprints, but also Todos os Dejos of Fantastic Plastic Machine and Apricot Morning of Quantic...Good taste of the producer in every songs (i love Cadien with Bud)the athmosphera it's really sexy, funky, contemporary grooves....I suggest for all the people that are in love with Costes series...here you will find a real top level alternative."
4,Excellent,This disc is really something to unwind with... The beats are smooth and refreshing and leaves you wanting more.......
1,Signal problems in South Florida,I finally called Salton after waiting the coffee maker to pick up the atomic clock signal for days. They told me that South Floridians seem to have problems with receiving the clock signal and told me to move the coffee maker to another room and have it face northwest. I keep on moving my Melitta from one room to another without success.I do have a table clock that gets the correct time from Colorado (where the atomic clock is located) and it seems to be working fine so maybe there is something wrong with the coffee maker's clock. It does show time but unfortunately not the right one.I brewed coffee with my Melitta and I liked the flavor. It was a bit noisy though during the brewing process.
1,Atomic clock my foot,"I suppose it's not surprising that a coffee-maker brand can't tell an atomic clock receiver from a transistor radio, but this is awful. If you want a coffee maker and you have [some extra money] you want to spend, go ahead and get this coffee maker. It will be fun to confuse your friends by prominently displaying an incorrect time in your house.I have a SkyScan clock (ASIN B00006BT14) in another room that acquired a signal and sync'd instantly the second I put the batteries in. This is clearly not a problem with my location, as the tech-support folks at Melitta would have me believe. It's a problem with the product."
1,No better than what I had.,"I bought this coffee maker because 1: name brand Melitta, 2: 1450 watts of power, 3: box said it brewed at 200 degrees, and I'd really like to make a HOT cup of coffee at home. First pot brewed at 190 degrees and after that nothing above 170 degrees. Tested my outlets and everything. Contacted Melitta, they say it's not defective and because it's used, Firefly won't take it back. Very Disappointed."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS **NOT A O N E S TAR ITEM**,"Unfortunately at AMAZON you don't have the option of NO star.The atomic clock not working is only one of a myriad of problems for this hunk of junk. The BREW time is way too SLOW for starters, but that wouldn't matter if the pause/serve worked. Not to mention, it leaks and it is very difficult to get a 'ground FREE' cup of joe. I have had my share of good & bad coffee makers. This is definitely the WORST NOT worth it!"
3,good I think....,I got the coffee maker and I have used it 4 or 5 times and really liked it. I liked the styling and the overall look. The time still is not right but I can deal with that. My problem is... the top fell into the pot and as I was trying to gently remove it the glass shattered. I am having problems finding a vendor that has a replacement carafe.
1,Melitta filters don't even fit,"I purchased this coffee maker thinking that since melitta manufactures the cone filters, it should be a well-designed machine. I was so wrong. Every time we make a pot of coffee, we have to wonder if it will be filled with coffee grounds. This is because if the filter isn't folded over and perfectly fit in the cone, it overflows and the ground pour out into the carafe.My husband & I really hate this coffee maker. We are online shopping for a replacement today. Don't make the mistake of buying this."
5,"Marcella Cucina, by Marcella Hazan","This was a present for friends, I already owned a copy and think it is one of the best Italian Cookbooks ever and always so easy to use, also brings back wonderful memories of Venice and it's markets."
2,Poor Design,"Good Price, but poorly designed. In most PC Card slots, you won't be able to remove the CF card from the drive with your fingers -- the drive seeds itself too deep into the slot. Therefore, you have to eject the drive to get the card out -- very inconvenient."
1,didn't work for me,"Should be simple....I put an 8MB CompactFlash card in the adapter, but the adapter in the card slot on my laptop, and....nothing. I could not get my computer to recognize the card, it never showed up as another drive, and of course the adapter comes with ABSOLUTELY NO PAPERWORK to refer to. I looked on Viking's site for help, but all relevant notes clearly assume that your computer sees the card, and all glitches must happen after that. Four emails to Viking tech support elicited no response. Lame lame lame!"
2,Not compatible w/ Mircodrive,"This adapter only accept type I compactflash card, i.e. those flash memory card; It can't fit type II card, such as microdrive, and some CFII modems. The reason is the CompactFlash Type II card (or so called CompatctFlash+, CFII) is slightly thicker than the CompactFlash Type I card.So if you are looking for a CompactFlash type II adapter, keep looking."
4,Plug and Play on the Mac,"I just plugged it in and it simply worked -- both on my PowerBook 1400 running OS 8.6 (which exploits it as an extended memory hack) and on my Titanium PowerBook running OS 9 and OS X. I have iPhoto set NOT to launch when the card is inserted on the TiBook.I gave 4 stars because it arrived quickly and did the job as advertised with no hassles. (To merit 5 stars, it should have had better documentation and a more detailed troubleshooting guide)."
5,Works like a charm.,"This Compact Flash Adapter work's great. All you do is snap you compact flash card into it and slap it into your Slot and bam! It is also much faster for me then hooking up my Digital camera to the computer using a USB cord and AC/DC adapter (saves on batteries). Faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading. I can highly recommend this product, I am very happy with it."
3,AR-15/M16 Practical Guide,"Info is a little old but I wanted it for maintenance, and that doesn't change much over time. The price was right."
4,An excellent resource for the already converted.,"As a long time environmental activist and graduate student in philosophy I found the book wonderfully comprehensive in its analysis and explanation of deep ecology. The book delves nicely into the sources of deep ecology and its response to other perspectives on environmental issues. I found it a quick read (I read it at the gym, but then, I read Heidegger for fun) and well put together.It will not, however, make someone who is coming from a perspective far from deep ecology change their mind. For that I would recommend Muir or Jeffers or better yet, spend some time in the real wilderness yourself. What it does is provide extensive background material and elucidation of the philosophy to someone who already believes in the importance of wilderness preservation."
2,No Bill Bryson,"I read this book and thought Why on earth does this guy think anyone is going to find this interesting?, a question one never thinks to ask of Bill Bryson or Dave Barry. Yes, it's informative and very well written. The fact that there is no cohesive force in the book is not the main problem. The main problem is that it's not funny enough, and even when it is funny, it's not funny enough. OK, so-so and not too bad, but this guy is no Bill Bryson."
1,Why bother.Life is to sort to read bad books,"An extrodinarly dull book.I agree wholeheartedly with another review this is such a typical english persons behaviour abroad critising others and there countries and culture.Having visited and lived in many of the countries he wrote of I found him in most cases to be quite inacurate, how can you you define a country by visiting one or 2 towns{small},he continued to drone on about individuals and their accents their habits which he didn't like the scenery he didn't ,cities he didn't like all in all he appears to find nothing pleasant in his entire journey.Why would a publishing house help to produce such dull and ignorant writing."
2,Dated,Obviously produced in the early seventies. Production values fairly low. No real useful information. A few interesting photographs. Dry presentation.
1,terrible.,it is now 3 weeks after i placed my order and still no sign of my textbook. I emailed her but no email back. It hasnt even been shipped yet! so unprofessional DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM ISERGRL!
2,go girl,"bought it used, listened to it, did not understand it, have relisted it for sale on amazon. sorry, but i just do not get it. was a waste of my time. thanks, hope someone else can explain its deep down meaning. not for me."
4,The Sidetracked Sisters Catch Up on the Kitchen,"I don't like to read, but this book was a blast and I finally got my kitchen in order, and it has been organized for several years! Love it!!"
2,Beware of damaged discs,"I ordered this set twice and had problems both times. Whoever attempted to match the audio and video had to be deaf because the sound doesn't match the actors' lip movements. They seem to conserve lip movements in Wycliffe videos which makes watching the series a bit difficult for us non-Brits, but to have a delay makes watching the series painful. If it was a one-off problem, I could be more understanding. The fact that two sets were defective means there is something seriously wrong in their quality control."
2,Very dissapointed with the quality,"I bought this specific keyboard for my 4 year old daughter piano class because the teacher requested it. ( I talked to the teacher and she said she did not want the parents to spend a lot of money)Eventhough I read the bad reviews. The keyboard came with scratches that were painted.The music stand came broken, the first time we put batteries the lid broke so we had to tape the batteries enclosure the first time.The only good thing is that since we are carrying to my daughter's school and it is big it might get broken at anytime and it was the cheapest 61 keys keyboard you will find.We had to spend extra money buying a case ($38). I became very dissapointed.I hope she will get tired of it before it becomes unused."
1,Flawed Premise,"If you read this book, please also read Thomas Sowell's recent Quest for Cosmic Justice. Lemann spends this whole book trying to figure out how some undefined ""we"" (by which he means people of his own academic and cultural background) can arrange life and society so that money, power, prestige, etc. are distributed and redistributed ""fairly"" without ever defining what that is.This is a foolishe, authoritarian and doomed quest -- ultimately it leads to the Pol Pots of the world. Sowell's book explains the fatal flaw in this kind of arrogant reasoning.By the way, I went to law school with one of the principal characters in the book. She wasn't nearly as interesting, then or now, as the author tries to make her."
4,"entertaining, but lacks focus","It's a good (if spotty) read. It covers topics such as the development of intelligence/achievement testing (although could do more to explain the difference between the two) and its history in America. Lemann is at his best when he's talking about the philosophies that undergird the various views on testing, but he allows himself to get too far off into character portraits of figures in the battle over California's Prop 229, which takes the final third of the book. His coverage of 229, by the way, is decidedly one-sided, making protagonists out of the folks who wanted it defeated (and Affirmative Action preserved). By the time I reached the end of the book, I realized that it had been a fun read, but I was left wondering... what exactly was it about, really?"
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing and biased. An apology for soviet style racial and ethnic quotas a/k/a ""diversity"". The history of the College Board is good. The PBS program based on the book is better."
2,boring,"Read the first fifteen pages and set it aside. This was a purchase I made a year ago, and it is on a subject that highly interests me. But it is really just a rather droll take on the evolution of the SAT test from job-interest tests. Thumbs down."
4,The Big Test - An interesting Book,"The big test is a very interesting book. The author makes you feel as though the story concerns you. The author uniquely ties earlier chapters of the book to later chapters. For example, the story of how Mr. Kaplan started his test prep business is discussed in chapter 9. This is connected to the information in chapter 19.I would recommend this book to college students. I think if students know the history of SAT and other standardized test, they will develop a different attitude about these tests."
4,Pride and Prejudice and Vampires,"In this charming and surprising novel, vampirism takes a backseat to the comedy of manners that is small-town Victorian life. When mysterious, interestingly pale Sir Geoffrey arrives, two of the village's most eligible young women find themselves swooning at his feet--literally. Clever, Emma-esque Violet teams up with her cousin Elaine to solve a medical mystery that takes them, unescorted, through the most unladylike fields of haemotology and vampirism, while managing to elude both a bloodthirsty fiend and the fiendish matrimonial mechanisations of Elaine's social-climbing mother. Blood and Roses is a delightful comedy of manners, combined with a genuinely clever whodunit and hung with the classic trappings of a vampire romance. That such a marvellous and original vampire novel ever slipped through the cracks is a downright shame."
5,A 30 Track Sixties Summary,"Another winner from the ACE label of the UK. This time, they have turned their attention to Top 100 American-originated Rock and Roll/Soul/Pop from the years 64-69. This contains 30, rpt 30, songs, nothing terribly obscure (maybe the Soul Sisters ""I Cant Stand It"") All classic (though I could do without ""Eve of Destruction""). For the price, you cant really do better to get the mood for your Party! Other Standouts: Sir Douglas Quintet's ""She's About a Mover"", Bobby Fuller Four's ""I Fought the Law"", Lee Dorsey's ""Working in a Coalmine"", and I could go on. Outstanding sound, and copious and informative notes! Well, what are you waiting for?"
3,Need better AI! Or better Canasta player to program!,"This is the only Canasta game I could find for Mac OS X-Intel, so I am very grateful to Masque for that. But compared to my old Hoyle game, I am disappointed. I scream at my computer partner at least once a game. We have 6 Queens in a meld, and she throws the 7th Queen into discard? I have played close to 100 games now, and I have yet to see my opponents, or even partner, freeze the discards- very strategic in Canasta. The Spades game is better as far as play, High Skill is difficult to win, these players seem to know their stuff!! Solitaire is ok."
3,Canasta is not the best!,"This game is for 4, not 2. Your parner is not a good player even on the High Skill. If you have 6 cards in a meld, she will throw away the 7th card. It is not written well, but it is the only Canasta game I can find for Mac-OS X Tiger. I guess it is better than nothing. Even on the High Skill, it is easy to win."
2,"Lots of card games, but poor AI","I've played hearts, cribbage, spades, crazy-8s, and freecell on the Macintosh version of this game and it's only average. It suffers from the same problem most card game software does--it doesn't feel like playing with other people. On the ""medium"" level the AI shuffles the deck in the machine's favor as you improve. Unfortunately this has the affect of making you think it's stacking the deck instead of playing better. Also, the ""help"" is poorly written--if you don't already know the card game the help is confusing--just buy the Hoyle book or Bicycle book to learn a game you're not familiar with--it could do with tutorials and hints to help you improve your game."
3,Okay solo/stupid partner,"I bought this for the gin rummy which I enjoy. However, I just started playing canasta and find myself constantly screaming at my ""partner"". I don't have to repeat the horrid discards the partner makes that are absolute nonsense. I no longer even ask to go out because the partner has no brain."
3,fun,for the money it was a great buy ..... loads of fun an great when waiting for a plane well they need more ok here it is
4,Great Item,I heard about StainX from a friend who had several house pets. I knew that she raved about this product and I used this product at her home as well. I have used this product on my own carpeting and found the same satisfaction in StainX.
4,Superb first half.,"Covers Nixon thru Clinton. Excellent insight into the top White House position. Very strong on Nixon thru Reagan, though not sure if not too worshipful of Reagan. Loses momentum on Clinton. Too much Whitewater and Health Care, not enough Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky."
4,Zen view of less-than-Zen people,"I came away from this book being informed about the characters, but being most impressed by Gergen's demeanor. The book clarifies a number of misconceptions, esp. about Nixon, Reagan and Clinton not by turning black to white, but by painting them the right shade of grey. I am glad to see Nixon's Jekyll side separated from his Hyde. It is gratifying to see someone acknowledge Clinton's almost unprecedented intellect, while not being shrill about the moral issues we already know about. The almost ""bulletized"" analysis was sometimes a bit dry, and so was Gergen's even (quiet flows the don) style of reporting. That said, the book was a very enjoyable read."
3,Eyewitness to Power,"David Gergen exhibits his keen intuitive grasp of the obvious with his superficial observations of presidential politics. He claims to reveal lesssons on leadership, but instead delivers an old fuddy-duddy's point of view on the machinations of the Washington DC establishment. There are no real lessons here--just a boring set of shallow, self-important observations by a person who was near power, but weilded none. Don't waste your time or money."
3,adulation for a retired actor,"The book is fun to read and gives a feel for the byzantine workings of the White House. The politics of being President seem only slightly more arduous than those of being effective in the competitive environment of the White House. The book has the feel of a objective analysis but really is a testimonial to Ronald Reagan, the author's idol who with his quips and organizing competence made the Presidency work and made the people happy. In contrast, Carter and Clinton fall to the bottom of the bag- the former because of his misreading of the Presidency and its imperial function, and Clinton by permitting his wife to have so much power. All in all, the book is well worth the price and the time, is well written, and provides some peeks into areas most of us would never see."
5,Insightful and Interesting,"In the days of tell all books written for a quick buck, Gergan's work is not only impressive but also refreshing. Gergan leaves the dirty little secrets writing to others while he shares his experiences severing four different Presidents.He focuses a lot not only on the personality of the presidents but also their management style. He also takes into account the factors that influenced each administration.Eyewitness to power mixes together part of Gergan's autobiography, presidential history, and lesson on management.If your interested in the inner workings of White House, stop watching television shows and read Gergans work for true insight on how four different Presidents operated their White House staffs."
3,"Decent read, but could be much better...","Uneven...Most people (based on the reviews I've read) seem to like this book and it's not bad, but I found myself liking the parts that just told the story of that particular administration and wanting Gergen to continue to tell the inside story of the Presidents that he served, not an analysis of ""leadership"" from a person that doesn't really seem qualified to make that assesment. This book was interesting to me only when history was being re-counted by this administration insider with the psycho-analysis of Presidents like Nixon and Clinton better presented elsewhere (Haldeman's ""Ends of Power"" for Nixon or Stephanopolous's ""All too Human"" for Clinton). Read it for the history and not for a ""leadership"" analysis."
2,Disappointing,"Gergen's book is awash with name-dropping, inside baseball, and self-serving reminders of his proximity to power and his influence,,,although the evidence of whether any of the truly powerful accepted his advice or were influenced by him in any meaningful way is scanty. In my judgment, it has been his willingness to pander which has made him a ""bi-partisan"" figure, rather than true intellect or political savvy (a la Moynihan).I find the book to be the same as the man,,,narcissistic and full of self-promotion. There are much better views inside Washinton."
4,worth the read,A very sensitive coming of age book; subtle humor and even-handedness makes it one of the best of its genre.
1,No redeeming qualities,"I bought this book for a 12 yr old but decided to read it first before offering it to her. I'm glad I did. No one should read this book. The first line of this book is the reason I bought it but it went downhill from there. The history lesson was in no way applicable to the book. A story of teenagers in the '70's , the book was rife with drug abuse, family abuse, infidelity, brutality and suicide. I have absolutely no positive feelings about this book. I threw it in the trash when I finished with it.I'm frankly surprised that it got good reviews. Were we reading the same book?"
3,Christie Ten Little Indians remake,One version of an early Agatha Christie tale that is not one of her best. An unbelievable story but with the Christie magic and good acting makes this worth viewing.
3,I enjoyed this version...,"...but then I have enjoyed all tellings of the story. I do like the 40s version better, but this version is enjoyable, too. And it is better than the Oliver Reed version. (It's like that the other great British standby, The 39 Steps, 1935 version is best, then comes the one from 1959 which I also enjoyed, but I have to admit I do not like the 1978 film.)"
3,i still like the 40's version better,"while this is an ok movie(the story is what i give the 3 stars for as well as the nice transfer job done for this) i just can't enjoy this one as much as the 40's version""and then there were none"" the one thing about this one is the lack of danger and suspence! it just never really grabed me the way the 40's movie did. that being said it still will appeal to most mystery fans so maybe rent it before you buy!"
4,This is an edge of your seat thriller of a Christie classic.,"George Pollock has done excellent justice to Christie's tale, Ten Little Indians. Although Christie sets her story on an island Pollocks' use of a Swiss chalet does not lessen the tension. To Pollocks' credit he uses the location to remain true to the story line, even to the point of using some of Christies own dialogue. I highly recommend it."
3,"Hey, let's take a great story and totally ruin it!","The story was updated, moved to a chalet in the Swiss Alps, and the old spinster became a beautiful actress. All bad ideas. The movie tells the basic story, but manages to be quite dull and eventually loses all focus as it spirals to an end. The cast is bad overall; Dalilah Lavi is especially bad, and Fabian should never have been allowed to act. Skip this one (and run in fear from the 1975 version with Oliver Reed and Elke Sommer), stick with the original from 1945 titled ""And Then There Were None."""
2,Poor Quality Film,"This DVD is practically impossible to watch. Whoever converted it apparently didn't realize that black and white films aren't literally black and white. I really would advise that you don't purchase this. And that's such a shame, because it really is a great film (when you can see it)."
4,An entertaining mystery,"This is an entertaining adaptation of the Agatha Christie classic. It is advertised to include the ""murder moment"" that was in the theatrical release - IT DOES NOT! Get it anyway - It is the BEST of the adaptations entitled ""Ten Little Indians"" The 1945 version entitled ""And Then There Were None"" is better in some ways, but I liked this one too."
3,OK RETELLING OF MYSTERY CLASSIC,"THE CLASSIC 1939 NOVEL BY AGATHA CHRISTIE GETS ITS SECOND OF FOUR FILM TREATMENTS. THE 1945 FILM VERSION IS STILL THE BEST(THE TITLE IS ""AND THEN THERE WERE NONE"") AND THE 1989 VERSION IS A LITTLE BETTER. I HAVEN'T SEES THE 75 VERSION THOUGH IT HAS THE SAME WRITER AND PRODUCER OF THIS VERSION. THE FILM IS SET IN THE ALPS IN THE MID-SIXTIES WITH AN ALL STAR CAST GETTING BUMPED OFF ONE BY ONE TO A NURSURY RHYME. (FOUR LITLLE INDIANS GOING OUT TO SEA, A RED HERRING SWALLOWED ONE AND THEN THERE WERE THREE.) THE FILM IS GOOD BUT IT ADDS SO CALLED VIOLENCE AND SEX THAT IS JUST LAUGHABLE. A FIST FIGHT UP AND DOWN THE STAIRCASE COMES TO A HALT WHEN THE JUDGE SAYS ""NOW, NOW THAT'S ENOUGH."" THE SEX SCENE IS THE COUPLE LYING DOWN ON THE BED THE CAMERA CHOWS US THE FOOTBOARD FOR THREE SECONDS AND THEN IT IS OVER. BASIC STORY IS STILL VERY GOOD BUT I'D SEARCH OUT THE 45 VERSION INSTEAD."
4,Ten Little Indians,"My 5th grade teacher used to tell a story at the end of the weeks's class (friday). However, he never got to finish the story, so after 8 years I finally found the corresponding movie. Therefore my opinion of the movie might be biased. Never the less I think it survived the test of time and still can serve as afternoon entertainment. If taking into consideration the time this movie came out, it definitly is amazing."
4,"A very good movie, although the changes.","It's a very good movie from a very good story. But they changed some details, including the end of the story. From who don't like changes, it's a bad choice. But from the ones who think it's acceptable, it's a perfect choice."
4,Silver Shadows shows Silver Lining,"I was immensely impressed with this book. I found Cunningham's previous books to be highly enjoyable reading, but her characters seemed a bit too bland for my taste. In this book however, I really felt that she breathed life into Arilyn. We finally get to see what's going on inside her head and get to really see her as a person.A well done book, and make sure to catch the next one, Elfsong, which twlls us what Danilo was doing during her adventure."
2,Ones more Great!,"Silver Shadows is again a great book written by E. Cunningham. Arilyn develops and overcome her anxiety of the moonblade, and she becomes proud to be a bearer of it. If your a fan of Elaine, this is a book i recommend. Elaine give us more of your great fantasy :)"
3,"Good, but not great...","This was a pretty good book, in comparison to the other fantasy novels on the shelf, but it was nowhere near the spellbinding... flow that carried the other two along. In the first two there was a sense of personality that carried each character along, something that you could identify with, even in the villians. I didn't see this so much in Shadows. Overall worth reading, but don't go in expecting the same quality of Elfsong and Elfshadow."
3,"Great plot, but the characterizations needs work","First of all, I'm a HUGE fan of Elaine Cunningham's(in fact, I'd give all 5 of the other books of her's that I've read 5 stars each) so you can imagine my surprise at not liking ""Silver Shadows"" as much as her others. In fact, the plot is just as good as her others. However, Foxfire was so perfect that he soon became unlikable, and I for reasons I won't go into here(but please feel free to e-mail me and ask. i'd love to meat more of Ms. Cunningham's fans)I lost a great deal of respect for Arilyn. However, I did regain some of that respect because of her determination to spare Danilo the fate she unwittingly doomed him to. so: 5 stars for the plot, but minus a star for Foxfire and Arilyn, each."
2,A tale that drops off at the end,"I found this to be a boring book- my son had little attention for it. The idea for the story is good, but there is too many unanswered questions at the end. There is some good illustrative work however that may keep a smaller ones' attention to the story."
5,Brass! This Skipper & Crew had BRASS!,"Firing torpedoes from 100 yards out? Going where no boats had gone before, always in harm's way. God Bless Adm. Fluckey and his courageous crew. An incredible read! And may Adm. Fluckey rest in peace, who passed away on June 28, 2007, at the age of 93."
5,Two thumbs up! A tribute to our men in the silent service,"Fluckey's account of the U.S.S. Barb continues the fine narrative tradition of O'Kane (WAHOO, CLEAR THE BRIDGE) and Calvert (CLEAR THE BRIDGE)--an outstanding nonfiction thriller that not only takes the reader out on war patrols but provides a fine background of WWII America. Rate this a ""must buy"" for your military bookshelf."
3,"Great story, Poor writing style","I found the writing style in this book distracts from the story. I think the author tried to convey the excitement and tension of war patrols, but his use of dialog and histrionics detracts from the incredible story of his war patrols. Nice try, but there are much better (written) books out there on ww2 submarine warfare."
5,Lucky Flucky!,"As a NROTC midshipman, I confess to a certain bias. This book was a great read. Full of adventure, excitement, and good old-fashion story-telling, Adm. Flucky takes us through the 5 war patrols of the U.S.S. Barb with him in command. From his baptism of fire during his first patrol in command to the first ever launching of rockets by a submarine, his stories fill you with awe and make you wonder if they could be possibly true. I can say I was lucky enough to get a personalized copy from the author and will cherish it as I begin a career in the US Navy."
5,An extremely engrossing account of war under the sea.,"Eugene B. Flucky has made a wonderful account of his own interesting career and that of the men with whome he served and the ships on which he served. The descriptions of attacks are in such great detail that you feel as though you are in the conning tower of the sub with the crew. Time and time again you are pulled into an event that occured over fifty years ago, but through the story telling abilities of the author you feel like you are experiencing it for yourself. A great buy and a book that I am reading for the second time in less than a year. The only point that I would raise is with regards to the lack of colloquialisms, wich makes reading the book a bit laborious at times. Don't let this frighten you away however because it's a great book!!!"
5,The best book ever on WWII submarine operations,"With respect to the other great submarine commanders, this book is the best written of all. Action packed yet has a real feel for the human drama of war. The inclusion of the POW's own stories documents in a very real and moving way why this country had to fight and win that war.When the world came un-glued half way through the 20th century, I am glad there were men like (future Admiral) Fluckey to defend this nation. All of the patrols but especially the Barb's heroic attack on Namkwan Harbor left me stunned."
5,Realistic to the Nth Degree!,"I was fortunate to know Admiral Fluckey, and although I was in diesel submarines after World War II (1955-1968) you can feature yourself right there with the ""Skipper"" as you read his description of how life was on a ""sewer pipe"" submarine. Highly recommend it to any of those who were not on patrol during WWII."
1,It doesn't work on AEROPLANES only AIRPLANES.,"This must only fit American domestic planes.The two sockets on the planes using the Eurasia, Australasia and Africa routers are of different sizes. Usually only one of the plugs is live and with the other being of a different size."
1,seller,I wish I could tell you about this product but I have yet to receive it. I ordered it weeks ago and the seller sent it to the wrong address then tried to blame me for incorrect information. Very poor service. Buyer beware with this company (seller). Still waiting to receive it. Maybe within the next month or so. Whatever!
5,Great,"They were great!!! The image came out perfect. I would reccomend this to everyone, my daughter and her friends loved them."
1,Question,I did not find anything really new in this book. I am just wondering how I get my money back.
3,Great!,This is a great romantic fiction writing. I think the author is trying to justify a relationship with a younger woman. I had to wonder what their spouses think.
2,Great Read,My good friend Jay is a great writer. Unfortunatly what he writes is not necessarily what he practices. Take this book with a grain of salt knowing that most of it thoery that even the author has not put into practice.
1,Don't Bother,"Having met both Jay Ferris and Lisa Weger I find this book very interesting. They talk about ""going back for the offended"" yet they have left a trail of offense neither one cares to go back and clean up. This book is pure fiction. Don't waste your time."
3,Not his best,"i just recently found out that this book is a paraphrase of the book of mormon and it finally made sense to me. Orson Scott Card is far and away my favorite writer and i've read all of his books - even Saints. However, i could never understand how he could manage to write such a boring book, now that i know it's based on the book of mormon it makes a lot more sense. Not to put Card down, this is his only series (i think) where the books get better towards the end of the series, usually things get worse as the characters grow up, but here they only get more interesting, probably as he gets farther from mormonism. i'd recommend the whole series, but i don't feel that this book is worth reading on its own."
1,thanks for the revised version of the Book of Mormon..ugh,"I will point out what several other readers have..this is almost a direct copy of the Book of Mormon, except without the archaic language. Come on Mr.Card. You have talent and vision ( as is evidenced in the Ender's series)yet you take the easy road here and just change a few names and settings. Not to mention the disservice you do to your own religion (and my previous religion).People have enough problems with Mormonism..don't give the impression that it is all fantasy.All this book series does is bring up the question of if Joseph Smith was a talented fantasy/ sci-fi writer or a true prophet.I felt betrayed by this unimaginative pap."
1,A big turnoff,"This book was a big turnoff for me. I mean, it's a science fictionalized version of the story of Nephi and the brass plates from the Book of Mormon! I just don't think that you should take something sacred and turn it into a secularized book. It's just not right! I kind of stopped reading Mr. Card's books because of this......."
5,Mormonism with a delightful twist,"And I used to turn the missionaries away! I found this book delightfully funny and page turningly entertaining. Nope, it's not Ender's Game. Ender is not even remotely related. If you find this shocking and disconcerting, I suggest you white out Orson Scott Card and write in a name of your choosing. Perhaps then you will enjoy this book."
3,Not even close,"After reading everything I could find in the Enders Game series, this was really not even close. I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of time--I did give it 3 stars--but I don't think I would recommend it or keep it in my collection. Sorry!"
3,A tough beginning - a 6 so far.,"I am about 1/3 of the way though this book. I usually baze through a Card book, but this one has a slow start and is taking me longer due to my lack of interest. I would not normally finish a book like this (hard to stay with). But, it is an ORSON SCOTT CARD book, and his other books have shown me to be full of surprises and to be GREAT reads. Reviews indicate this to be a very good series overall."
2,Card's philosophical perspective gets lost in the jargon,"After reading the Enders series, I was prepared for a novel with a tight story line, a philosophical perspective and characters that have such a definitive moral and intellectual position that a consistant fair conflict was fesible. Instead, I was bombarded with a barage of misleading evidence and a plot development that had the makings of a high schooler. The characters power struggles usually ended up with either a fist-fight, or an unended conflict that resulted no where. These characters learned nothing from their mistakes, and continued to perform as a 5 year old when scolded. It seemed that Card wants to carry these small conflicts into each novel to bring familiarity, but all it brings is a sense of immaturity from even the God-like being. All in all, this book is hardly worth the $5.95."
2,Tough slogging,"I'm a big Card fan, but found this book to be slow. Some interesting concepts, but I had problems establishing any kind of empathy with the characters. Not much of a way to start a series. Stick with his other series"
3,Too much Old Testament too little Sci Fi,"This is the third Card novel I've read (also Ender's Game & Speaker For the Dead) and I just can't warm up to the guy's style. Memory shares Ender's thin story and Speaker's biblical tone. This book really seems like Card's attempt to write his own version of the Old Testament. There's precious little science here but lots of begetting and Cain and Able relationships and names like Gabbabuflux and Mebbekew and a talking wheelchair spewing messages from the Oversoul. Obviously Card favors characters over ideas, but I'll take Asimov's thin characters with a great Sci Fi idea every time."
4,A Good Begining to a Great series,"Having just finished the entire Homecoming series, I can honestly say that it was the 2nd best (Tolkien will always be first) fantasy series I have ever read, and this book is a good start. I actually got to the final chapter and didn't want to finish it beacuse I didn't want it to be over with. The series gets better volume after volume and builds upon each earlier piece, sometimes in ways that you don't even notice until later. Some seemingly insignificant events at one point seem to become critical later on. I think that I'll be reading a great deal more of Mr. Card's work as soon as I get over this one being finished. Don't be fooled by the 4 star rating: if possible I would give this book 5 stars, and add 1 for each following volume."
3,Who could have imagined a book could be so forgettable?,"I think my entire opinion of this book can be summed up in one word. Meh. Its not great, its not terrible. I'm not offended by the rampant religious imagery in the book, but I'm not thrilled. I don't find the character development to be horrible, but there's a definite shallowness that doesn't exist in Card's other writing. The storyline was interesting enough to keep me reading, but it was also one-dimensional that I finished the book in a day. No twists, turns or ANYTHING even remotely like an unexpected event. All in all, this was like a meal consisting entirely of mashed potatoes. Filling, but pretty bland and not likely to stay with me for long."
3,"Not great, but I'm interested enough to read the next in the series.","""...I thought 'The Memory of Earth' started off a little on the slow side, and the pace never really picked up too very much, but what did build throughout the book was intrigue. There are murder plots, mysterious rituals, prophecies, and the great mystery of the Oversoul. The religious theme runs strong through the entire story - people who submit to the Oversoul are rewarded, and those who go against it are inevitably punished - but I didn't think it was necessarily preachy. I've read that the series is based in part on The Book of Mormon (which is likely, since Card is a member of the Church of Latter-Day Saints), but I never felt like that was all I was getting out of the story (though since I'm not familiar with the Book of Mormon, it's also possible I just didn't have the frame of reference to make the parallels)...""For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"
4,The beginning of an exciting science fiction ride,"Card gives us the first of four very good volumes in a five book science fiction series. Basilica is a wonderful world and the characters that we meet will gain depth and develop over the series. Card is sometimes slow and tedious in his plot advancement. I liken his writing to a journey in which each step is mundane, but when taken one after another, cover long distances and present vista after vista.Buy it, read it, and then get the next three volumes. Then read the reviews before purchasing volume five."
3,meh,"Meh, its okay. I would probably listen to the rest of the series just because it is pretty mindless, and it doesn't suck, but it is a pretty transparently shallow attempt to rewrite the Biblical story... and somewhat insulting at that to a devout Christian. Fortunately, I am secure enough in my faith to just be slightly disappointed that the attempt was"
1,Waste of Time,"This book is a total [copy] of the Book of Mormon. I you want to read the real story, and be uplifted at the same time read the Book of Mormon. Yes, I am a member of the LDS church, and it is wrong to make money by exploiting your church. Yes we have a church book store. I hold that in the same opinion that I hold his book. If you want good literature read Robert Jordan,Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind or R.A. Salvatore."
3,"""Memory"" is not Card at his best...","...but Card is still Card, so the worst he could write would be average. My chief complaint is that he rehashes the first couple of books of the Book of Mormon in order to come up with the outlines of his plot. Card, if you'll pardon my blasphemous opinion, is a much better writer than Joseph Smith, so any borrowing he does is a step down. That said, Card consistently addresses the interworkings of religion, family, and technology to good effect."
4,Great story...but isn't it a little familiar?,"Hats off to one of the greatest science-fiction writers ever.Card's obvious talents for characterization, pacing, and subjectmaterial again make themselves known in this first installmentof the Homecoming series...but haven't we heard this storybefore? ""The Folk of the Fringe"" would know that this is a cleverinterpolation of a pre-established series of events, but the factthat the source is never referred to is a serious omission, notan oversight. Regardless of this, however,""The Memory ofEarth"" is a very engrossing read."
4,Card brings the Ender magic home with The Memory of Earth,"The Homecoming series is the second best Card series I have read, with Ender's being the first.This saga begins with the Memory of Earh and the tale of Nafai and his family in their struggle on the planet Harmony. The planet is controlled by a computer known as the Oversoul, who has been secretly breeding people in order to bring them back to Earth to repopulate it. This is an excellent story which builds up deep, rich characters and builds a strong set of relationships between characters. Powerful foreshadowing can be noticed in this book. What will Nafai and his family choose to do? Will they follow the will of the Oversoul and lead themselves out of their great city, or will they stay and Nafais's older brothers, Elemark and Mebbekew wish to do?If you have ever read a Card book, then you will enjoy this series as well. if you are looking for a book that is going to last through 5 books and develop upon each, then this is a series for you."
2,"Nice concept, rather dissapointing execution..","After reading Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and the worthing saga I was looking forward more Card novels... This one looked like it would be good, epic scale, cool computer, building of civalization, -- all the elements that worked so well in the other books i've read. But they don't work here. It not long before this book becomes a shapeless mess. I could say this and this and this is wrong with it but it wouldn't accomplish much. Nevermind, there are very good card books: The first two in the ENDER series and the ingenious WORTHING SAGA... so look at those first you should be very happy with them."
1,Pathetic Retelling of the Book of Mormon,"Having read the Book of Mormon, I was surprised that this had series had received any praise at all, and I am even more surprised by the reviews that state how ""original"" this story is. Card's retelling of the Book of Mormon in this series is pathetic - the story is lifted almost directly from the Book of Nephi in the Book of Mormon, the science fiction twist on this Book of Mormon story comes across as pedestrian, the writing is drawn out and exacerbating for most of the book, and the character development is just sad.If you want a better telling of this story then read the Book of Mormon.If you are not interested in reading the Book of Mormon then I suggest you stay away from Mr. Card pathetic Memory of Earth series."
3,A tough sell after reading Ender's Game.,"This was a decent book. It really was. It's just that it can be tedious and slow-moving at times. I read this book right after reading Ender's Game. Big mistake, mainly because EG was so completely phenomenal.Overall, Memory of Earth wasn't too bad. The plot was interesting enough (even if it is a knock-off of the Book of Mormon), and the characters were well-developed. Card does a good job laying out the setting and context for the story, but it seemed to me that...well....that was pretty much the whole book. Setting and Context. After finishing it, I outlined in my head all of the actual events and happenings of the book and didn't come up with much more than the political setting of the city of Basillica."
2,Very slow book that didn't make me care to read the sequels.,"This was the first book by Card I've read and considering how popular he is, I was disappointed. Even though I'm non-religious, I really didn't mind the religious parallels that some other reviewers mentioned, because I thought they were handled in a good and believable way. But I was disappointed with the story itself. It starts out very slow and never really takes off until the last couple of chapters. And then it leaves you with an ending that just sets the stage for the sequels. This wouldn't be a problem if ""Memory of Earth"" itself was an entertaining book that made you want to read the sequels, but it didn't make me want to do that. For the most part of the book, I wanted it to end so I could start reading something else.I wouldn't recommend ""Memory of Earth"" and it didn't really make me feel like reading any more Card. But who knows, I may give Ender's Game a chance since people say that's his best."
3,"Excellent concept, decent story","The premise of this series is very interesting and proved to be quite a draw for me. I particularly like the parallels to ""God"" and religion that are brought up as well as the ideas that humans are fundamentally evil and need to be controlled. The exploration of those topics are the most compelling part of this book and series. It is well worth reading this first book if you are interested in topics like that."
2,wait a minute....,"I picked up this book with enthusiasm as I found it soon afterreading Ender's Game. I found it somewhat disappointing, sadly.It just didn't engage the reader like Ender's Game did. It alsoseemed mildly familiar.. as did the names. Then it occurred tome that this wasn't Card's story really.. it was a sci-fi'dversion of parts of the Book of Morman! Names were lifted, etc.(I'd read parts of the Book of Morman while being 'recruited'at one point by this cute Morman lass.. but that's another story!)Anyway, while the story is somewhat interesting, I wasdisappointed by the fact that it seemed that Card probably spenta lot of his time and energy trying to make a good story froma weak one. It doesn't quite come off."
2,Don't be put off! Keep reading the rest of the series.,I'm a big Card fan but Memory is a bit of a dissapointment. However don't give up on the series as no. 2 and 3 are really gripping.
4,"Fusion of fantasy and sci-fi...Good, not great...","This series is good, not great. Definitely Card's B-material here. I'd recommend reading the Ender novels first, then Seventh Son and the Alvin Maker novels, with this last, even after some of his other novels. This series is based on an interesting idea -- that all of humanity has been relocated to the Planet Harmony -- with a computer overseeing human society for 40 million years. But the computer is breaking down, so she sends a small band back to Earth to recolonize it. Anyway, as with all Card novels, the characters are the fun part, and Nafai is yet another incarnation of the Ender character, only he's somewhat of a pale imitation, IMHO. These novels have more of a soap-opera-like, pulpy feel to them than your typical Card novels."
4,"Quite a text-book, but offers practical application","Bond lays all the cards on the table with his text-book approach to realignment of priorities and offers many tips on time management, organization, and other practical information. Could stand to be a bit more bearable."
5,Oliver Ho Rocks Again,"He's made a pure hard house record once again. Not much to say in fact, he keeps is deep sound style again. One of his great works. And u can see it from the sales rank too :)"
1,This is not a standard USB adaptor,"When this product was delivered I discovered it has something that looks like a USB connector, but it is not a standard USB connector. It is useless to anyone other than the owner of the computer specified."
2,There are better choices,"We just returned from a three-week cross-country trip, with a four day stop in Yellowstone. This book was o.k. to read before the trip to familiarize yourself with the park, but was useless as a reference guide once we were there. We basically gave up on it and used our Frommers Guide to the Western National Parks. The index is incomplete, the maps are cartoonish and difficult to read, and some of the explanations in the question-answer format with""ranger Norm"" made me feel as if they were questioning my intelligence. My husband and I both couldn't believe they showcase this book prominently in the Yellowstone visitor's Centers!"
5,The only yellowstone book you'll need,"Don't let the cover fool you. This book is great. Lots of details. Great recommendations on hotels to stay outside the park when the inside ones are book. My niece and I had a blast reading it as we went. We even ran into a bear jam, you'll have to read the book to find out what that is all about. If your looking for a book to simplfy your life and make this trip the best. Buy it! Don't let the cartoons fool you this book has all the details in great form for all. Buy it before you leave so you know where your going. THE BEST, ENJOY."
5,Planning a trip,"Makes a good reference book for our upcoming vacation. Although we don't know until we actually make the trip, this book would seem to be an ideal guide for our Yellowstone vacation."
3,bohemia against starbucksification,"i liked many parts of this book. the fact is that in America, bohemian living is so quickly co-opted by corporate America for its own purposes, that it is hard to touch or in many ways to live an authentic bohemian lifestyle. powers' book does a wonderful job of showing Americans in the past few decades struggle with sticking to principles while dealing with corporate capitalism. this struck a nerve with me as it may with many who feel at odds working in the typical structure, but haven't figured out what alternatives exist outside it."
3,Werid Like Us by: Ann Powers,"Very well written, interesting story. Would like to meet Ms. Powers in person and chat with her."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Having heard the author interviewed on public radio, we thought the book might be an interesting source for insight into the thoughts and principals of GenX. NOT! Largely autobiographical, and including many mundane details of the lives of her boring friends, the book gives no sense of her growth as a person, a serious weakness in personal anecdotal material. Ms. Powers also lacks a sense of history, or the logical facility to come to conclusions based on facts and comparisons. Everything simply IS. The only rule seems to be that Nothing, and no one, is subject to any kind of judgement. Oh, I've thought of a second rule that has been applied - different is rule 1. Anything ""same"" is uncool. How boring."
3,I'm still waiting for a good book on today's Bohemia,"David Brooks did a much more insightful and more fun analysis with his Bobos in Paradise. Powers is writing about a younger group of Bohemian sellouts. She tells good stories about herself and her friends (that's the My Bohemian America part) but when she tries to say what it all means, she doesn't have much to say. She doesn't yet have enough perspective on her story. She's still glowing with her (justifiable) delight in finding a comfort zone in Bohemia after being a high-school nobody and thus still wanting to believe that her Bohemians are somehow better and above the non-Bohemian, non-weird America(whatever that is!). A little more perspective on the way Bohemian ""coolness"" re-enacts high school hierarchy might allow her to take herself a little less seriously and us to take her more seriously."
3,Everything Changes Except The Avant-Garde,"This book in a few words: Everything changes except the avant-garde. Well-written but very navel-gazey and self-absorbed. ""Hi, like, I smoked weed, did lots of drugs, had tons of sex with unsuitable people, and then, like, you know, I grew up, and like, got a job and got married, but like, you know, I'm STILL Hardcore Bohemian, man! I'm out there! I'm making a DIFFERENCE!""Um, yeah.mmmmmm...um....take this one out of the library, folks."
3,Peppermint Oil Never Worked for Pest Control,"I had many people try this out for pest control, mice, squirrels, etc. and it never worked at all even at full strength. Do not waste your money if you plan on using this for pest control. I gave this 3 stars because you can use this peppermint oil in ice cream and candy making."
1,my mice don't care!!,"ok people, this definitely did NOT work for me. I don't know what kind of mice YOU have, but the ones I have in my house did not care a SINGLE BIT about the peppermint oil. I wiped the shelf of the cupboard, I left some cotton wool soaked with the peppermint oil, and additionally there was a cup of water with a few drops of peppermint oil in them. The bottle of peppermint oil with a few drops leaked out of it was in the same cupboard. GUESS WHAT I FOUND THE NEXT MORNING: a mouse turd, right next to the bottle of peppermint oil. I'm not joking. Those little bastards were munching away on brown rice all night, not caring about the peppermint smell... on to the next attempts trying to get rid of them"
1,mildew,"I bought 4 bottles of the 4oz peppermint oil, spent approx $60.00. Each bottle I used has a scent of mildew along with peppermint. After the peppermint smell wears off, all you smell is mildew. I have used peppermint oil in the past, and never had this problem. Sending them all back."
1,disappointed,was running out of my now 4oz peppermint oil from 2011 (still smells fresh). just opened the now 16oz. no peppermint smell but distinct foul stale odor. very disappointed. seems others are also noticing this with this product line. i'd recommend looking elsewhere.
5,Peppermint,"I love peppermint oil. This was affordable and its a great product. I use it for Colds, candles, and chapstick and it works well."
3,it was okay,Delivery was excellent but the product didn't work on mice as I expected. It smelled okay but the scent stays in your clothes and this I didn't like. All in all it is a good product it just didn't serve its purpose for me.
3,Great oil,"Peppermint oil has such a calming scent, which, makes it perfect aromatherapy for the bedroom. I look forward to creating different scents."
2,Did Not Repel Rodents,"It smells good, but the rsts over here must like the scent too. I bought it specifically to repel the rodents but they don't seem to mind the smell. We saw a rat run right over the area we generously treated. I'm disappointed."
5,Great smell,"They must have someone who gets your order and runs immediately to ship it. I never got anything this fast from anyone with regular shipping. I think it was the next day!Alas, I love peppermint but found out the oil is bad for most pets, especially cats so can’t use around the house. So this big bottle will last forever drop by drop into my shampoo and stuff."
5,Great results.,"Great results,seen in a couple of days.No mouse droppings seen after putting a drop or two of the peppermint oil on a cotton ball, where the little critter came in.And no harming the little mice.I used a sticky trap once and it broke my heart to see two little mice stuck, with their little legs broken trying to get free from it.And looking at me, in pain, I'll never forget how cruel that was.I love the smell of peppermint,the house smells great.I will tell my friend's that have the same problem,how the peppermint oil worked so well."
3,Smells wonderful!,"Just a little bit of this stuff & your whole house will smell like peppermint for days! lol Shipping was a little slow but it did come in on time. I purchased this because I read that it gets rid of mice because they can't stand the smell. Well, it appears that it didn't work for that because we still haven't been able to get rid of this pesky mouse!! We've used it several times and although I do like the smell it hasn't gotten rid of our problem. Peppermint oil has many other uses so I'm not totally disappointed with my purchase."
4,Works on our rodents,"I believe that if used consistently it does help deter mice. We've had a terrible problem since an old house and barn were torn down just behind our house. I have found dead mice in the yard and found their traces in my pantry. I've soaked cotton balls, put them in kitchen drawers and used a diffuser filled with the oil in the pantry. I have also used the plug-in type oil diffusers (Glade or similar brands) and refilled the glass portion with the oil. All together they seem to work well."
5,Perfectly wonderful. Refreshing.,This product was all it was said to be. It was potent and refreshing and has been useful in banishing all kinds of pests.
1,Not as Strong as other Peppermint Oils,Smells good but you can immediately tell that its not very strong which is really what is effective against mice. I have purchased Peppermint oil from Whole Foods and a little bit went a long way. I needed to use a lot more of this product and it did nothing to get rid of the mice. Save your money. Their is a reason why this is low in price.
4,Good product,Fast shipping . The product seems as listed....I haven't had it long enough to say it does keep the mice away. I am hoping it does but just started using it so not sure if it will work.
4,Good product.,"This product has a pleasant fragrance that is not acrid or overpowering, although it is concentrated. Works well in conjunction with Mint-X trash bags for an extra rodent-repelling boost. My only problem with this product was the poor packaging which allowed the plastic cap on the bottle to crack and leak some of the contents."
5,Great stuff!,"The packaging was excellent, and most importantly the product itself was very good. I bought it because I heard it's good for hair growth. However I find myself using it not only for weekly hair conditioning, but also for when I have headaches or feel stressed. Really nice and versatile oil. My favorite of the essential oil products!"
4,Strong scent of peppermint,"I purchased the peppermint oil to keep field mice out of our cabin, can't say that this works 100% of the time. It is fall and cold in the north and mice will do whatever it takes to find shelter, peppermint oil or not. The initial use of peppermint oil on cotton balls is very strong, but fades in 5 to 7 days so you have to apply it often. We hate mice so we will continue to use the peppermint oil, time will tell."
2,"Great Price, Not So Hot Product","I buy a lot of pure peppermint oil in a candy & baking supplies store in Manhattan. I pay $6 for two .5 ounce bottles of pure peppermint oil. I use it to keep mice away in the winter and I use it all rear round to keep the cats and dog away from certain areas. I saw the price and decided to order the 4 oz. botttle. I was very disappointed. I could tell my the aroma that it wasn't nearly as potent as the small bottles I buy - I would say it was diluted to a degree. Obviously I'll be using it but not for the reasons I bought it. Oil of this moderate strength is better for putting a few drops into a huge soup pot of water and letting it simmer for a few hourse so your home will have a nice fresh, minty scent. I won't be buying any oils from this company in the future."
5,Peppermint,"The product was what I wanted and I recieved it very quick, I am glad that I found it online."
4,What We Use Peppermint Oil For,"We Like Peppermint Oil , We Use It For Putting Sents In Rooms & For Mixing With Olive Oil To Put On Our Bodys As Lotion, It Keep The Skin Very Soft & Smells Real Good."
1,Does not work,"Peppermint oil does not deter the mice in my house - I have even found droppings actually on the cotton balls and around them; they seem to love the smell, as do I. And yes I renewed the oil every month to keep the smell strong. But do not expect this to work - I suspect this is an old wives tale."
2,"Burned and dried out my hair, but didn't follow directions","This burned and dried my hair but I really didn't follow the instructions to mix it with a carrier oil, instead a put on some castor oil, followed by the peppermint oil, followed by more castor oil. I am afraid to use it again on my already delicate hair."
5,Good bargain,"Good bargain for the price. we had bought 1 oz for $8. we have many uses for it. it can be usefulto buy a dropper so you dont have accidental spills and waste. we used it for mice, it keeps them away and leaves the house smelling minty and fresh."
5,Good Product,"Good product and keeps for a long time. I'm not sure of all its uses, but it has been helpful many times."
5,Love this product!,I wear braids and this is a good refresher. I mix it with water. I also use when my nose gets stuffy sometimes.
2,Weak,I read the reviews and was thinking this was going to be really strong and a couple of drops would suffice for air freshner and to open sinuses and such but we found that we had to use a lot to even get the peppermint scent! It wasn't really strong as a vaporizer so I didn't bother putting it in my lipgloss as a breath freshner either because it would take so much of it. I may have to order Rosemary oil to help strengthen it or Lavender oil.
2,another wives tale,"Seemed to work for a day but now I think these little critter mice are smarter than humans but (weird I kmow) I like the smell so will try with a larger bottle.I would try a a decon type product but I have a pet???Any suggestions? I can only use safety type traps and as you know ""see one"" you really have many."
5,Can't beat the price,"Great price for this product, would definitely buy again, item was shipped fast and it was what I had expected"
5,Pest Control,"I work in the kitchen of a youth camp. We are constantly trying to deter mice from making a home during our off season. I have done all I possibly can (putting all inventory in plastic bins, keeping things clean and never leaving dirty dishes out), but they still leave ""presents"" in various places. I read that peppermint oil works well, so I bought some and soaked cotton balls, set the cotton balls on a small piece of foil, and placed throughout the kitchen and stock room. I have found less and less evidence of mice! Will continue to use this product. Thank you!"
1,THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK!!!,"Let me preface this by saying this is my first amazon.com review. I felt compelled to write it because this stuff simply does not work!! I purchased it because of it's fabulous reviews, and figured if it works for everyone else, it will work for me! I have lived in my apt (in Boston) since September. I had an exterminator come in after my first confrontation with a mickey mouse in October. Everything was fine until December. After seeing 2 in one month, I bought peppermint sacks. These did not work, so thus I purchased this oil. I SOAKED the cotton balls...put them in every corner and baseboard. Freshened them up each week AND after cooking. In short, I used this entire bottle in 2 weeks. YET, I saw 2 mice devils in these 2 weeks. Also, let me add we do not keep trash in our apt, and wash dishes as soon as we use them. SO this does not work. I guess I am going to become a creepy cat lady now...and hope that helps."
2,Didnt quite work for me!,"I bought this in hopes of detering nasty mice. While the activity is less, it doesnt keep all of them away. I soaked cotton balls and put them all over plus I made a mix of the oil w water and sprayed it.Also I thought the smell would be appealing but its not. Its driving my husband and I nuts."
3,"Good product, long wait.",Good product! It smells beautiful and brings peace to my soul. The wait to receive it brought me some disharmony though. It took weeks. Go to the store and get a small bottle to soothe your senses while you wait for the big bottle in the mail.
4,good,the smell is kind of strong so be careful but it works. just put a little bit only but besides that I guess it's good.
1,"NASTY, CONTAMINATED, PRODUCT","I have the same bad experience as other recent reviewers. The peppermint smell is overwhelmed by a foul nasty odor. The product is nothing like the (german) peppermint oil I used in the past. It is either contaminated or the result of a nasty chemical extraction instead of steam extraction. If this product was FDA regulated it would be recalled and pulled off the shelves. Totally useless (except maybe for repelling mice, if that works at all) and potentially toxic.Thanks to the other 1* reviewers I ordered only a small bottle and minimized my losses.Maybe this is just a bad batch (other reviewers obviously love the product) but I am not going to try my luck a second time with this manufacturer.Looking for other suppliers........"
1,Doesn't last,"After reading other reviews, I was hopeful this product would help keep field mice at bay. Unfortunately, the scent only lasted about one day. On the second night, the field mice returned. Overall, I have to rate this product as disappointing. For an undiluted oil, it loses its scent far too quickly."
3,like the product,"I like its fresh peppermint scent, the bottle is a little small comparing to the price. But overall it is a good purchase."
1,3rd bottle I've purchased was horrible!,"The first two 4 ounce bottles I bought from Amazon were wonderful. The last one I purchased in November '12 had a rancid smell to it. I compared it side by side with the little remaining in the bottle I purchased previously. NOT EVEN CLOSE!NOW told me ""we haven't had any other complaints, send it back to Amazon"" I'll be looking for another brand."
1,Not worth the money,"Had bought my first peppermint EO in a small bottle made by another manufacturer. Loved it and went through it very rapidly. Thought I would try this brand because it was a far bigger bottle and priced much cheaper comparatively. As my dear sweet mama use to say, ""you get what you pay for."" Smells rancid. strongly recommend you do not buy."
3,Smells good but seems ineffective for rodents,"I purchased the peppermint oil as a safe option to rid the house of mice. I've applied the oil pretty regularly around the attic and storage areas where mice might lurk and the activity hasn't seemed to reduce much, if at all. It's only been a few weeks and I'm going to keep trying but I may have to break down and buy poison if it doesn't work soon. On the plus side, this seems to be a good value for the money and the smell is very pleasant (even if it's not very long-lived)."
1,:0( Didn't work for me either,"I am with the others who it didn't work for. 100% peppermint oil and I actually saw a large flux of activity. We have been infested in our apartment and cannot figure out where the heck they are coming from. They eat holes all in the carpet to get in and out. Lined the areas with wire mesh, maintenence filled holes in kitchen and still coming in. Used this and have seen/caught way more mice than before the application. Someone said they wondered if the mice saw it as a scent of food and I wonder that myself. I am so frustrated, I don't know what to do. These things are making me a absolute wreck."
4,Wonderful for my asthma & allergies!,"I use this oil in many ways, but the most beneficial for me, is in my oil burners. My asthma & allergies often make breathing difficult. Nothing helps as much as burning this oil. For a cold, or sinus infection, I add a dropper full to a kettle of boiling water & breathe it in. Instant relief!Dilute some of this oil in light olive, or almond oil & rub it on inside of your lips for nausea. Add a few drops of it & some sea salt or demerara sugar to some light olive oil & use for an energizing body scrub. Especially good for regenerating sore, tired feet.I give it only 4 stars, because it's more economical to buy the 16 oz. size."
4,Does its job,We recently had mice in our apartment building. We initially tried soaking cotton balls in peppermint oil and keeping them near the trash-cans. We got better results by also adding a few drops of peppermint oil inside the trash can. Seems to work well for two weeks or so (even after the can is emptied). It acts like Pavlov's experiment i.e. the mice get it in their memory. But after a while we need to add it again. The only drawback is that the entire apartment is filled with the smell of mint.
5,Peppermint Oil repels mice,"I love pure peppermint oil during the winter months. I live in an old farmhouse flanked by fields and cotton balls saturated with peppermint oil placed in drawers, behind appliances, etc help keep mice away. The 4 oz bottle I purchased cost less than what I was paying in the health store 5 years again. The scent is very strong."
1,my mice like it,"even tho it gave me a headache, i persisted untilmy cotton balls wound up being stolen for nesting materials.i guess not all mice are ""allergic"" to it."
4,Good Product.,"Great for mice control, since they are allergic. Gives the home a pleasant smell which doubles as an air freshner/ Will purchase more."
3,Peppermint Oil,"I am only giving this product 3 stars due to its lack of potency. I use it as a spray to deter mice, but even after a couple of hours the scent is gone. I have tried other peppermint oils and the scent was good for days, not hours."
3,Bought as a mouse deterrent,I'm giving this three stars because it appears to be exactly as advertised. I bought this to deter mice (they were under the hood and in the trunk of my car) but so far Bounce dryer sheets seem to be working. I hope they're gone for good; I hate mice.
5,A GREAT Repellent for Mice!!!,"We have tried for 7 years to keep mice out of our motorhome (Tiffin Phaeton), with no luck, UNTIL THIS YEAR! Reading about using Peppermint Oil as a mice repellent, I purchased this Peppermint Oil from Amazon, and it's been a GREAT SUCCESS!"
2,Peppermint Oil hasn't worked for our mouse problem,"It's been two months since I put a bunch of cotton balls drenched in oil all around my garage. We are still catching mice - think we've had four. I've doused the cotton balls a total of three times; maybe every 3 weeks. Maybe I need to do it more often?It does make the garage smell nice, but it hasn't really helped with our field mouse problem. Oh, well...."
5,As advertised,Used for rodent control and works fine. A little of this on some cotton balls strategically placed and no more little friends running around.
5,Good stuff,I do a lot of baking and this oil doesnt bake out. This company gives great service.Would recomend it to everyone.
5,Great Quality,Strong scent and great for DIY room freshener or hair care add in. Great value for the amount you get.
2,Never got it,"I ordered this item and was told it would take several weeks for delivery, then I received an e-mail a few weeks later that it was going to take even longer....so I cancelled the order. I'm sure it would have been a good machine, but I went with the larger 7-cup model and I'm happy I did."
3,Fun game,"I enjoy this game, but needs better tiles to choose from. Tiles are boring, needs more pizazz"
1,Likely won't work with a new Mac,"We had this software for our old PC and recently bought a Mac. We thought we could install it - it says for both Windows and Mac OS X, but got an installer message ""Power PC applications are no longer supported"". Evidently this is because some old Macs could run it, but the new ones have Intel processor chips that won't. Too bad - it was a good game and we'll look elsewhere."
1,Did not work on my Mac OS 10.8 computer,"This game would not install on my Mac 10.8 laptop. I called the company, (Masque) and they sent me an upgraded one (for a $10.00 charge), which worked fine. I wish this option would have been available through Amazon. I wasted the money I spent for the game I bought from you."
1,This is NOT Mahjong!!!!!!,"Again, this is one of the many stupid tile matching games created by ignorant computer programmers that call themselves ""mahjong"". They should be called ""Mahjong SOLITAIRE"".Real mahjong is very different 4 player game similar to gin rummy and is way more fun than stupid tile matching. Chinese people play REAL mahjong, not this tile matching solitaire game.I hate it how these programmers mislead so many customers about what REAL mahjong is, there is more to it."
4,Hot like Caldo de Oso Panda,"Ojalai and Se Vale To are in constant rotation in Puerto Rico. The unique flow of Residente makes Ojalai a stand out track. Its witty, silly and a tongue twistingly different take on reggaeton, reminding me of the tongue in cheek style of DU back in the day. Its nonsense that makes sense.For something a little different than the standard orgasm mamis moaning ""ay papi"" with a rapero spitting the standard issue sex and party to cookie cutter dembow, check them out."
4,Great album,"I'm not into reggaeton to be honest and most artists in that genre I find very redundant with the exception of Calle 13. I honestly believe they stand out with their mixture of sounds and beats. It's really refreshing to hear Calle 13 get exposure.Residente has been compared to Eminem and I guess I could see the similarities BUT I honestly believe Residente has more to offer because his lyrics are more wise, twisted and comical.The only latin hip hop that i can admit to listening to are the old school like Vico C and Lisa M but i think Calle 13 will be able to be in that category of well respected artists if they continue with their brilliance."
3,socially conscious?,"The beats are irresistible, the rhymes are original & funny. But Calle 13 falls right in line with the rest of the industry in terms of crude, hard-core sexism and objectification of women. I would recommend the edited version, if there is one."
2,wtf,booo this cd kind of sucks.... i mean it is okay i guess but people are acting like it is all some new kind of reggaeton... sorry it is just played old hip-hop... atrevete-te-te is by far the best song on here....
4,Read Them in Historical Context,"May doesn't need defending, but here goes. You have to read the poems in historical context to understand how brave she was to write them. She had to overcome not only fear of the public, and of the poetry industry, but of-- in those days-- the psychiatric associations, and all the internalized voices of her distant youth. This was wrong. This was bad. The self censorship was the most stringent censorship of all back then. She may not be Bishop, as a pure lyricist, but she was far braver."
3,weaker than i expected,"I really expected a lot out of this collection, but I found it to be rather weak as a whole. In fact, many of the poems were a stretch as to if I'd even call them love poems. ""Because I Don't Know"" stands out as both a great poem and a great love poem. But one of the other of the best poems ""Strawberrying"" is a stretch, I think, to call it a love poem, though there is some sensual imagery in it. I just thought that this collection would be better than what it is."
4,Excellent performance.,"Thais is much more than a vehicle for sopranos of a certain age to get in touch with--or attempt to put us in touch with-- their sluttish sides. And this issue is much more than just a budget starter-set of Massenet's take on Anatole France's regenerated courtesan. The sound may not be up to the best of late 1950's studio hi-fi, but it is high quality contemporary broadcast sound--no scratchy high ends, voices well centered.Andrée Esposito has a full, brilliant, steady, expressive and quite lovely voice. Too bad her discography is so brief. (...). The more familiar Robert Massard is excellent as Athanael. This is altogether a fine performance of a comfortably melodic classic."
5,Great food for thoughts and discussions.,"My future husband and I have read the book together dedicating a daily reading and commenting in writing on the read chapters, as we live on differnt continents. This way we made our way through the book and have now a list of subjects we can discuss face to face.The book gives you a great insight what a Christian marriage is about, rules to follow and new views about mystics that are out there of, e.g. a submissive wife.As it is all bible based, its like a manual of do's and don'ts.Don't miss the opportunity to read ahead of marriage or when you try to find out how to improve your marriage."
5,A Marriage Manual!,"This book should be read by all women and men alike who are considering marriage, or are married. The truth is spoken in the pages of this book, simple plain truth about marriage! What the Word of God has spoken on the marrige union, and how we are to ""Have A Marriage Without Regrets"" Take the principals of this book and put them into practice and see God change your marriage. Read it, apply it, live it out, and watch your dull,I don't love you anymore, I want out marriage into a marriage with God in the center."
3,"I like McSweeney's, but...","I'm a fan of McSweeney's and I'm slowly amassing the entire series for my personal library. I also love comics and art. I just found this collection to be unsatisfying for a few reasons:1. The comics seemed to hammer constantly on the theme of suicide and depression. It was much darker than I expected in tone.2. The artists represented seemed limited to ""old-timey"" cartoons or whiny auto-biographical stories about longing and melancholy.3. Some of the comics didn't seem to be of a high-enough quality to what I've expected from McSweeney's.There are a few comics in there that I very much enjoyed and a few artists that I have now checked out, but overall, I'm disappointed with this edition after all of the hoopla I've seen online about it."
4,Best McSweeney's issue,"To date this has been the best issue of McSweeney's. If you're interested in comics in any way, or even if you just want a pretty book around the house, I highly recommend this.There are some great pieces of prose by excellent people in the comic community, and even more importantly it's chock full of great independent comics and excerpts. It's like having the biggest Sunday comic section ever made, except all the Nancys and Family Circuses are replaced by the likes of Chester Brown and Joe Sacco."
3,"Okay, but be careful witht the cap","The steam iron arrived in good time and brand new. The results on my hair were okay, but have found that a simple ceramic flat iron produces much straighter hair. Be careful with the steam cap-it kept falling off while I was using it. The last time it fell off it hit my arm just below the shoulder and produced a nice burn (maybe second degree)."
3,Better than those survived the crash stories but not by much,"I've got both the paperback and hardback (this one has the most attractive cover)editions and found the story very interesting but also saddening. The Princess could have used some sort of getaway so often in her life for stress reduction, to possibly save her marriage, even to save her life.So many people used her to make themselves a lot of money without caring anything about her, I wonder if this book mght be one of those. Amazon's descriptive reviews tell the story very well and I did find much to like in the book but I just can't shake the feeling that Lefcourt was simply in it for the money. I think it is a better story than ""Whose Death in The Tunnel?"" and possibly better than ""A Life to Di For"", but not by much."
1,A Waste of My Time,"This is one of the weakest Presidential biographies I have ever encountered. It reads, at times, like a high school or college research paper, loaded with personal opinion from the author when it is facts I was seeking. Constant references comparing Grant to Napolean, Ike, FDR, and various 20th century leaders is annoying. I noticed two ""between the lines"" references comparing the current US president disfavorably with Grant. One example of the references that drove me crazy;(page 121) ""The line the Clinton people threw at George Bush pere in the 1992 election campaign might have been aimed with equal effect at Grant: ""It's the economy, stupid."""" George Bush ""pere""? Good thing I had high school french.The only redeeming quality is that the book is short, and if you wanted a quick read on President Grant this is the one. However, be prepared to experience a book chock full of cute and annoying associations."
2,Not a best choice bio,"This is a pop biography not up to basic historical standards. It is a quick overview with as much attention to suggested modern parallels (often in movies) as to the historical situation of the topic. The authoer often makes sweeping generalizations which are unsubstantiated (even countered by some historians). From reading other Grant bios one can see places where Korda simply misses some things.The book is nicely written and engaging. It will provde you a brief overview of Grant, but don't take it as authoritative."
2,Needed a better proofreader,"I lost interest in the book, and thought it lost all credibility, when three times on one page (p.62) the book referred to a General McClennan, instead of McClellan. Inexcusable for a major publisher."
4,Ulysses S. Grant,This was a very interesting book about a man who was an outstanding general and a moderate president. Few people know about Ulysses S. Grant and this book covers his life and times with interest and objectivity.
5,James Pocock Review of Grant: The Unlikely Hero,"Michael Korda's short biography of Ulysses Grant is the best book on the persona of Grant that has been my pleasure to read. As a graduate of West Point and 38 year veteran of the Army and Army Reserve, I have been a long-time admirer of Grant's military skills; and I was familiar with most of the facts of his life. Yet Mr. Korda's focus on Grant's personal characteristics and the forces that influednced his thinking was refreshing.It was illuminating to me that Mr. Korda expanded on Grant's unhappy childhood, his courtship of Julia, and the difficulties he had with his in-laws. This was helpful in understanding many of Grant's actions, and the well-researched information was presented with stimulating prose.I was particularly drawn to the author's portrayal of Grant's struggle as he was dying of cancer to write his memoirs and provide for his family. Altogether, I found this a rewarding and delightful biography."
1,Recommendations,"These amazon reviews have done their job, in convincing me not to bother reading this book. There are two excellent studies of Grant as a politician and president, both by Brooks Simpson: LET US HAVE PEACE and THE RECONSTRUCTION PRESIDENTS. I highly recommend them."
1,Inadequate and out-of-date,"PeopleSoft has changed dramatically since this book was written. Even if the book were up-to-date, it is so lacking in detail that it would provide little benefit."
3,General ERP Implementation Guide,"This is more of a general ERP installation guide than it is a a book about PeopleSoft financials specifically, which is actually a good thing since the PeopleSoft information is now dated. This book was written with PeopleSoft versions 7.0/7.5 in mind; the new PeopleSoft version 8.0 is a very different product. Still, the general ERP information is still valid and accurate."
1,"This book is terrible, I know... I'm a peoplesoft consultant","I consult with peoplesoft and I think this book is very bad. It has nothing much to do with peoplesoft, just implementation of financials. No detail or direction on how to...just talk to fill pages. a terrible waste of money. zero stars"
3,"Guide to Implementation from 50,000 feet!","If your are about to begin your first experience in implementing a large scale client/server application like PeopleSoft then this book is probably a must read for you. The book does a very good job of covering all of the issues you will face and need to plan for during your pending implemetation. If you are looking for detail (below the 50,000 foot level) then you will probably be disappointed."
5,This book has worked wonders!,"I required my whole team to read and implement this book. After six months we discussed how it affected us, and the results were incredible. It is a must read/must use!"
4,PeopleSoft,"Purchased the book last weekend and couldn't put it down, since I am involved with PeopleSoft Financial Implementations. The book certainly speeds up the learning cycle for the ""newbys"" and expierenced PeopleSoft consultants alike. If you are expierenced then this won't be big surprise, however if you needed a way to communicate the process to your superiors then buy the book and give it to them to read. The PeopleSoft manuals are three feet high, this is about 1/2"" thick. Very consise and enlightening. Larry O."
4,Good at what it claims to be,"Not detailed in PeopleSoft Financials. But then, read their documentation if you need that. It does do a solid job of looking at implementing PeopleSoft from a project and planning perspective. The world is full of consultants and managers who CANNOT think for themselves. This book will keep them from fumbling. If you have an experienced ""A"" team in PeopleSoft, this book won't help. All others: will be beneficial."
1,Fluff.,"This book was almost complete fluff. Most of the content was generic (applicable to most ERP conversions) or just about Peoplesoft general features. There was *very* little about financials, either at the process design or configuration or administration level. One doubts whether the author had any xprince with financials at all. I'd say th book falls just short of fraudulent misrepresentation."
1,The book is not good,"In my opinion, this book does not give much details about the implementation of peoplesoft financials."
1,Thought I'd find all the technical answers - NOT!,"Since this was the 1st book published & I was looking for technical answers to questions that no one had, I saw this book & bought it. It was just another 10,000 foot overview of the product and a free advertising of the product. There were no specific answers for what I was looking for & still am looking for from the technical side. I give this book a thumbs down, but if a non-Peoplesoft functional individual wanted an overview of the product having not seen it; it maybe of some use from that perspective."
2,Recipes were distracting,"To the point of irritating, forcing the reader to refocus making it a very difficult read. ~Affaire de Coeur"
5,comedy at its best,"Shirley Jump's Pretty Bad is fast-paced, fun, yet emotional read. Don't miss Pretty Bad, the story, the recipes won't let you down."
3,witty,"Pretty BadShirley Jumpreviewer Pamela Ackerson (author Home of the Braves trilogy) Prepare for an emotional seesaw when you read this book. You will find yourself, irritated, laughing, grinning, and holding your breath during the sizzling love scenes."
1,TWO DIFFERENT COVERS.........THE SAME BOOK,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!....REALLY LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TWO BOOKS.AND WHAT A CHEAT TO DISCOVER I HAD THE SAME BOOK UNDER DIFFERENT COVERS.VERY CARELESS. EXPECTED MORE OF AMAZON.COM.
4,Danny boy does it again.....,If you are a Gator fan or a Danny Wuerffel fan you will love this book. It tells his story and relationships formed throughout his college years. Most importantly he takes you through the National Championship year and brings back good memories. There is some humor and serious thoughts in the book and the print is large. Every few pages there is a picture or two for illustration purposes. I did occasionaly find repetitive statements mentioned earlier in the book but not an overabundance of them. Overall you should like this book and you may be touched spirtually at the end when he discusses his faith and love for God. Pick it up and enjoy it for years to come. Go Gators!
5,Thoroughly enjoyable read,"Having followed Gator football for years, I particularly enjoyed watching the career of Danny Wuerffel. His impeccable character, stellar performances on and off the field, and willingness to share the gospel of Christ without shame made a fan out of me.This book gives a vivid account of Danny's Gator years, including humorous stories and behind the scenes details. Although only the last chapter focuses on his faith, his great character and inner peace shine brightly throughout the book.I learned a lot about this fine example of a man, and I encourage all who have even a passing interest in sports and/or faith to pick it up. I think every reader will find something to inspire him or her to greater things."
1,Animal advice? Not this one.,"I have been successfully training dogs for a number of years, all with positive methods, but I buy current books to keep up on new theories. My 6 dogs are happy, well adjusted house dogs, who have happily completed obedience, agility, carting and conformation events with joy. This is the worst book I have ever spent money on, in terms of animal training. It will do far more damage than good. Their suggestions are ridiculous, especially when they are based on the assumption that your pet thinks like a human. People will expect their pets to respond to these training methods and when they don't? The publisher should have checked the facts before letting this one go. It is just plain wrong, poorly written and offensive to anyone who loves and respects dogs and books. I suggest reading the Culture Clash by Jean Donaldson for real information that works to improve dog and human communication. And no, I am not related to her....."
1,This book belongs in the trash,"Giving this book even a single star is being far more generous than it deserves.The authors' advice for training by throwing an object at a dog is the worst recommendation I've heard. I'm suprised that these so called ""experts"" haven't stooped to the level of telling people to rub the dog's nose in his feces in he defecates in the house.The authors don't back up their ""facts"" with any documentation or viable research and leave the reader to just believe blindly. What a poor excuse for a book about understanding your pet.A veterinarian friend of mine read the authors' first book, ""Smarter Than You Think"" and said it was the worst training book he'd ever read. I feel that way about this new book so at least the authors are consistent in their style.Save your money."
1,This book is dreadful,"Save your money. The only 2 things the authors have to say are 1) to get your pet to obey you, throw a sneaker at it; and 2) feed your dog fresh vegs & meat instead of store-bought food. You wouldn't mind if they backed up these points with research, data, and solid arguments, but instead all you get is completely unsubstantiated claims, assertions, and the occasional letter of testimony from a supposed customer. Much of the material, beginning with the whole of Chapter 1, is so pointless and badly written that you want to throw something a lot harder than a sneaker at the publisher."
1,Wretched,"This is the most poorly-written volume of bad advice, misinformation, fabrication and fantasy in the modern ""dog training"" genre, and that's going up against some pretty stiff competition.Please, please don't try to do the things that are vaguely described in this rambling waste of perfectly good trees. Many of them are potentially harmful to you and your dog. All of them are an insult to your dog. Don't throw things at him, feed him cake, isolate him from other dogs, or bolt him to the floor for an eight-hour stretch (or at all, for that matter).The ""prose"" itself is an insult to the reader. I can't believe a legitimate publisher let this one get by. It's like being privy to the acid trip of a particularly dull deadhead.Just because something is contrary to everything else you have ever heard or read doesn't make it ""revolutionary"" or full of new insights and fresh ideas. Sometimes it's just the ramblings of a disordered mind, or minds."
3,"works OK, but...",it seems to work well *except* (and important in a camera) it does not want to focus very well many times. I am thinking of sending it back for something else.
3,wrong description,"AMD ADA3400AXBOX Athlon 64 3400+ 2.2GHZ 1MB PGA754 Pib is wrong, the real item is AMD ADA3400AXBOX Athlon 64 3400+ 2.4GHZ 512KB PGA754 Pib, but the price is not bad."
4,short,"This has a good medium softness and the stick has some flexibility. I use it with all percussion, drums gongs timpani etc. but I am looking for one that has a longer and a little bit more flexible stick."
5,Perfect blend,"Beautiful, hypnotic, Arabic-tinged Andalucian music. More naturally flowing than some of the new Hispano-Arab music. Relaxing but not new-agey or medieval."
4,"I broke it, they sent free part to fix it.","Glass knob broke when I rinsed a very hot machine with cold water, so I count that as my fault, not theirs. It's a good looking machine, and makes a nice cup of coffee. I emailed Melitta about a replacement part and they gave me the 800-number for the manufacturer. When I told them the glass knob had broken, they sent me a replacement at no cost; despite the fact that I told her the machine belonged to a group I'm a member of, and I had no idea who purchased it or how long ago. So no complaints from me."
1,broken knob,This coffee is in the teachers lounge. We have had to return it 3 times because the glass knob keeps cracking. It happened just the other day when the steaming hot water hit the knob it cracked. We are unable to use it and have had it for about 6 months so cannot return it. We have also looked for a replacement knob without any luck. Sorry. I suggest they try for a better knob.JM
1,Unbelievably Bad,"The moment I received this urn I took it out of the box to see how well it worked. As the water reached the 25 cup mark the base started leaking in one spot. By the time I called customer service and got through to a representative, water was coming out around the entire product. It's amazing that this thing is on the market!"
1,Piece of junk,I really like the coffee pot EXCEPT for the glass knob that shatters every 2 months and blows scalding coffee all over the kitchen.. I've been burned twice because of this.. and have filed a formal complaint with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.I cannot get the Salton Melitta people to give me lifetime glass knob replacements.. so I will be returning mine to the store where i bought it before the warranty runs out. DON'T Buy this Item.. JUNK!
1,Perculating problems with Melita coffee urn,"We've had our Melita urn for a couple of years. It has worked fine until recently. It does not send the water high enough up the tube to perculate and drip water over the coffee grounds. The unit is beyond warranty. Very disappointing. A waste of money for a product we thought was made by a reputable company with a good, reliable line of products. I wish we could get a refund. Next urn will not be a Melita. Companies (including Melita) should read reviews like this and offer product recalls -- and take pains to improve their quality control. Bring jobs back to the US."
2,"great story, poor presentation","I have loved this short story ever since I first read it about 10 years ago. Notice I said SHORT story - yet here it is blown up into an oversize hardcover with several very poor illustrations and presented to fans for a $17 cover price. Who would shell out the money for this? I'll give you two alternatives to buying this book: either look for the Alex Nino-illustrated adaptation in Marvel Comics' ""Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction"", or scan www.bibliofind.com for the story in its original collection, ""Paingod and Other Delusions"", which, even though rare and a bit pricey, will still cost less than this particular book (and includes other stories)."
3,"With beautiful art, who needs a good plot?","It seems that the creators of this beautifully embellished book did not consider a good storyline a necessary part of written medium. Rick Berry deserves five starts for his splendid computer art. Harlan Ellison deserves one star for his abomination of a story, which tried to take on the hysteria of a dystopia but miserably failed. Overall, I recommend this book for fantasy art collectors. If you're here to get this book for the story, don't bother - you're better off donating your money to a lost cause."
2,decent short story,predictable story. uses lots of adjectives/adverbs. I regret spending the money for 15 minutes of nothing special
1,Emperor's New Clothes,"This is good writing? A story dashed out in obvious haste with an obscure ending, stolen from 1984, using five modifiers when one will suffice, reflecting the author's dread of deadlines -- like the one he was under when he wrote this. At this price, it ain't worth it, even with the art."
3,Buy a compilation,This is one of my favorite short stories ever but unless you're really into pictures and pretty books on your bookshelf buy one of his compilations (the Essential Ellison is excellent) and get more story for your money.
5,My favorite music software,I have been using Cubase for over 10 years & even the earlier versions on the Atari platform. I must warn anyone with little experience recording that the learning curve is rather steep & it's still rather steep if you have experience. There is so much to this programme that you can easily spend a great deal of time just digging into Cubase to discover all the features. You also what to have as large a HD as you can possibly afford to dedicate to your audio. Once you get comfortable recording you will be surprised how quickly you can use up your HD. I have gotten into the habit of clearing out the trash in the audio pool after every recording session since I have gotten confident knowing when I have what I what.
3,Very Temperamental,"I purchased the Mellitta MEX2B in October last year. While I enjoy my morning mocha, I find the machine very temperamental. At times it is necessary to fiddle with the lever for brew strength (just to get the machine to work!} and the cap on the water tank does not fit very well which sometimes messes up the whole process. I have had to turn off the machine and wait to readjust it and start over. Sometimes I have to add more water (probably because too much steam has escaped from the lid; which I don't think is suppose to happen). This is my first espresso machine, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I am less than satisfied."
2,lots of follow the bouncing cloud to inane lyrics,"this is my 22 month-old son's first Thomas video; from the cast list, i thought it would have Ringo singing, but it doesn't, instead english kids sing inane lyrics. the stories are cute, though each ends with slow panning of all the trains and their name labels. it's o.k., but i'll try to get an Alec Baldwin one, hear he's better. My son liked the trains, but wasn't enchanted by the tunes in the least."
2,Colossal Disappointment,"This book provides an awful snapshot of modern Chinese fiction. With a few notable exceptions--Mo Yan's muscular, hard-hitting story 'The Cure' primary among them--the selected pieces are overwritten to the point of nonsense.Consider this brain-bending sentence from Bi Feiyu's ""The Ancestor"": ""The sky secreted a viscous historical atmosphere.""Awkward phrasing and mistranslated phrases make nearly every story in this collection painful to read. I got the sense that the Chinese authors are begging to be taken so seriously that they fill the stories with big words strung together to the point that they end up incomprehensible.How does a sky secrete anything? And how is an atmosphere viscous?Chairman Mao most certainly would not be amused.In fact, he'd probably send Comrade Goldblatt in for some re-education."
3,Swift and Deadly action + Some suspense = Worth watching once,Charles Bronson performance is riveting. The plot has big logical holes which reduces the entertaining value of the movie. The worst thing about this DVD is the video quality. It looks washed out from the beginning till the end. The ending scenes were too dark I could hardly see anything. It looked much better when it was re-run on the Movie Channel.
