3,My review,"The book came in about 1 week and was in NEW condition. I have not read it all yet, but some of the forms and advice look interesting."
1,Preachy,"I picked up this book as I was traveling. I found it less than entertaining. Through out the book the author preaches at you. I was not able to bond with the characters because of this. The author takes various time periods in history and uses them as a reason to preach on the dangers of guns and as the reason for gun control. She also preaches about the Vietnam War and I was very upset that she would make such a blanket statement as the soldiers that died, died for nothing. I agree that it was a war that didn't need to be fought by us I draw the line at any such statement about our service personnel. Although I myself do agree with some of what she says I pick up fiction because I want to *get away* from the realities of life instead the book was like being in a one sided debate."
4,it gets better,So Akiko and Tajima called themselves being cupid as they hook their friends up on a double date with Momoko and Yosuke! Not if that evil fire devil Igneous has something to say about it. He sends out a devil wolf on them.
2,Novel very picturesque but awkward,"I purchased this novel because it is set in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The novel does a great job of decribing the area and its attractions. The story, however is trite and the writing style ham-handed. The author uses the book to spout off on his personal biases and to indulge his personal fantasies in a not so subtle manner. As a travel guide the book works well. As a mystery novel it is lacking"
1,"Dreadful novel, decent location guide","As a lifelong Michigan resident and frequent visitor to the Upper Peninsula, I was excited to read this book set in familiar environs. Much like Steve Hamilton's Alex McNight series, Lewis demonstrates that he knows the northern Michigan area and history in great detail. The other settings of Hawaii and Singapore are also fleshed out in such detail that I assume (having never been either place) they too are spot on as well. Unfortunately, that is about where the positive tally ends for me. Not long into the book it became obvious to me that the plot and writing style was amateurish, lacking any hint of sophistication whatsoever. To make matters worse, just past the middle of the book comes the first of several of the author's political ideological rants.In the end, I was only able to finish the 'novel' by approaching it as a caricature or parody and enjoying a good chuckle over it's many inanities."
3,Esta libro es magnifico!!!!,"Este pequeno libro esta estupendo por que nos ensena como saber de las piedras y cristales, con estas piedras preciosas que la madre naturaleza nos ha dado, y que por eso debemos ser conciente de no destuir nuestro precioso planeta..!!!!!"
5,A rare and wonderful Gem,"This album is wonderful. Emotional, insightful and musically mature. This album was a random desperation choice found in the returned CD section. It has found a new home in my top 5 all time favorite recordings."
4,"First-rate, in-depth study of brewing","~Miller has written a book that covers ALOT of info about brewing and the science thereof. For anyone weaned on Pappazian's books, this is the next logical step. Every aspect of the science of brewing beer is covered.~ sometimes funny style, but that doesn't detract from the excellent layout of this book, which leads from simple partial-mash brewing to all-grain mashing via a logical and step-by step progression of ideas and metho"
4,useful book,"Husband has loved this book, it's been very good to get started brewing and understanding some of the science behind the brewing process."
4,A Fresh Take on a Notorious Neighborhood,"When viewed through R. Dormarunno's 19th century lens, life in 21st century NYC sure seems TAME! I liked these combined two separate (albeit related) novellas.This volume will go on my shelf next to Caleb Carr's ""The Alienist,"" Tyler Anbinder's ""Five Points"" and Herbert Asbury's ""Gangs of New York."" Next up for me is David Carlyon's new ""Dan Rice"" bio!"
1,Kindle Version is messed up...,"Hi - I just wanted to warn people the kindle version of this book has problems. The hyphenation is off with certain font sizes (hyphenated words end the sentence without completing and the next page or paragraph starts up). It also switches narratives in the middle of paragraphs early on, only to resume them as though the intervening non-related pages did not occur (which appear to be from a later part of the book.)I'm reviewing because I'm out of my 7 day Kindle return policy, and can't return the book for a refund. Kindle users beware!"
2,A Hero's Homecoming,"This would have been a very good book if the author had left out some of the explicit sexual scenes. It seems like the first half of the book is about the bedroom. It would have been a must shorter book without them I'm sure. Perhaps she was reaching for a story, and couldn't find enough to fill a whole book and decided to fill it with sexual stuff. It's a shame! The storyline could have been very good."
2,Kai......Great scent..too bad it doesn't last,"Just couldn't wait to get my Kai as I always have loved it when tried on in a store. I was delighted when I sprayed it on, but was very disappointed to realize that the lovely fragrance barely lasts til you reach the door of the house. Too bad, I won't buy it again for this reason."
5,Smells Amazing,"I bought this for my mother when she came and visited for a vacation.We could not find it anywhere and of course I found it on Amazon. This product is from SoCal and has a unique smell. Not too strong, not too weak. I highly recommend this perfume!!!! The dealer shipped it pretty quick."
3,Kai Eau de Parfum (1.7oz),"i saw this fragrance on another site and wanted to try it. i love gardenias...other sites said the other scents are tuberrose, lily and jasmine.now i'm trying to decide whether i like kai - it's really pretty right when i put it on. the gardenia is wonderful and makes me feel like i'm in the tropics. after it fades, it's a softer smell, still white flowers but i feel like there is a musky note which i'm not big on. the scent lasts a while which is great....it's a nice day scent, i think. jury is still out on this one about buying again, but overall, it'll be good for spring/summer."
3,Scent does NOT last,"Love the scent, unfortunately the scent doesn't last more than an hour. Try something else"
1,NOT the Kai I have been using for years....,I just bought this recently and it is DEFINITELY not the Kai I usually buy from Lucky Scent. I have been wearing this perfume for years and I know that it isn't the same. It also doesn't last for more than an hour. I bought from this seller because it was much cheaper...now I know why! Hard lesson learned...
1,found out they are not a true kai retailer,"bought kai from this site found out they were not a authentic kai retailer, got perfume, box was open, not shrink wrapped bottle nozzle was wet, and perfume was not filled up. learned my lesson, now go to kai's website for authorized dealers....you get what you pay for."
1,Only good as a lent catcher,I got this product thinking it would be great. But it unzips while inside the washer. Then I got a safety pin for it. Well now its just catches a lot of lent which then after I have to pick off my bra. I bought a different kind and brand which works much better.
4,"Good buy, only fits 1 or 2 bras","I was in the market for a delicates bag to wash my 40 dollar bras in and came across this item. It works like a charm, but the reason for only 4 stars is that it fits one, maybe two bras. I don't want to jam anymore in there, so this is the only draw back. Especially if you are doing a ton of laundry at once.I would for sure recommend this, especially for teh price."
3,Atta Amber purcahsed through Amazon,"The bottle of Tunisian amber arrived very promptly from Attar Bazaar.Unfortunately it didn't smell quite the same as previously.It was still spicy and warming, but there was an acridity at the end that wasn't there before.If I can't find Tunisian amber in another brand, I will restock with Attar Bazaar."
5,Amazing Celtic-Christian Prog,"Let me start by saying I LOVE Iona. I can't think of anything bad to say about them. The music itself is so passionate and meaningful and the orchestrations are amazing. Personally I think it was a great idea to write an entire song cycle about a thousand year old illuminated manuscript of the four gospels and what they mean to the faith of the musicians. Inspiration from something so deep and personal clearly resulted in a deeply, personal composition. Iona is wonderful and this album was an excellent addition to my library.Another excellent Iona masterpiece is the live album with the All Souls Orchestra. It has some pieces from The Book of Kells, and some from other albums, and it is really beautiful."
4,It's like Pure Moods for Christians,"If you like a Sarah McLachlan and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra sound with a hint of saxophone...this CD is for you. Great Christian themes! Not Preachy. Revalation, Chi-Rho, and Kells are the only tracks with singing."
2,"Actually, this *isn't* the sock monkey song.","The Intel song used the original version of ""Umbabarauma,"" by Jorge Ben. I bought this CD (Lust's) specifically for that song, but unfortunately it's not the same - this version sounds like a couple of pre-pubescents jamming on their Sony keyboard. Just plain dumb, if you were to ask me.Anyhoo, if you're looking for the original version of ""Umbabarauma,"" I've discovered that it's on a compilation called ""Beleza Tropical,""."
3,Don't listen to these reviews,"This is an underwhelming album in every sense of the word. There are a few flashes of brilliance, but that is it. Listen before you buy, you will thank me."
3,Blockhead bobs heads,"3 1/2More appealing and less bland than prior outings but still not sampled exquisitely enough to shake off its motions-going objective of instrumental hip-hop, DS is only offset with a few duds in an otherwise intelligently fun engagement."
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought this when it first came out thinking, ""Hey! Another Sugarcubes album!!"" I love the Sugarcubes. (I'm not a big fan of Bjork's solo stuff since I don't think the musicians on her solo efforts have the creativity of the Sugarcubes members.) I listened to It's It and thought, ""What is this junk?!!!"" I know these are remixes, but the songs aren't even recognizable. They could have put any Sugarcubes title to any of these songs, and no one would have known the difference. The only song that you can recognize as a remix is ""Regina"" which was remixed by the Sugarcubes themselves. I listened to this album over and over thinking maybe it will grow on me. A couple tunes are kind of catchy, but other than that--yuck. I haven't listened to this thing in years. It's now collecting dust... Unless you feel you have to have absolutely everything from the Sugarcubes, don't bother with this mess. Just stick with their first three albums and wish they were still together."
1,Santa Hat,"I did not like it since the picture looked of a better quality. I got one Santa hat for my son before and it was very well constructed. This one is just a piece of felt and nothing else. In addition, my 16 month old son's head did not fit well in it. It was smaller."
2,"Rent before you buy, seriously!","All this movie is is just a karate movie. Not Kung fu just Karate! The movie itself is a bad recording and the title describes everything! This a movie about revenge and the love of doing it! The hero of the movie instantly becomes a villain after his mentor meets with an unfortunate ""accident!"" Then goes on a Charles Bronson rampage killing everybody that he thinks had something to do with the ""accident!"" The ending sucked and even though there is the hint of a love story that still didn't stop the other ""accidents"" from happening! My advice is to buy for the lowest price possible! Better effects, actors, story line, and recording from videotape to dvd could've made this at least look better!"
3,Money making....,"What a brilliant idea to re-release all the morrissey singles, and the sound and all is ok !!! But the covers are miserable.. Bad scannings, and the text is allmost impossible to read !!! What a shame to release such a great singer under such lousy conditions !!!! There's even no booklet to come along with the package, to explain about the releases !!!! Shame on you !!!!"
4,"Great, but not as good as the first box set","This is a nice set as some of these singles are becoming increasingly hard to find. There was an earlier box set with every single from ""Suedehead"" through ""You're the One for Me Fatty"" included, which is superior to the above item as it includes the original singles in the compact jewel cases. However, if you don't have the earlier box set this is an essential item for any Morrissey fan. Unfortunately, neither box contains the rare ""Certain People I Know"" single which is near impossible to find at a reasonable price."
4,Funny and Frighteningly Accurate,"This very amusing and thorough look at the British class system (up to the late 70s when it was written) is so accurate it can make you laugh one minute and cringe the next. To a large extent, much of it still applies today but in some areas things have lightened up a little I think (hope!). Jilly Cooper has a wicked sense of humour and a very easy style which made this book a very enjoyable read. Bravo! Pip, pip."
2,Out-of-focus Black & White,"Do not confuse this Monacelli Press book with the latest Rizzoli book by the same name. This one is an ""artsy cofee table book"" with slightly out-of-focus artsy black and white photos of a limited selection of his projects, including some of his earlier houses as well as some of his latest works. Large two page photographs are shown, together with 3 or 4 smaller ones per project, in lieu of a more comprehensive exposition of their work. If you are looking for information on their current work or design ideas check out the Rizzoli books instead."
5,Isis rox.,"First of all, these guys are nothing like Dillinger Escape Plan. However, Neurosis comparisons are valid. Both bands rock the mid-tempo and represent with long, repetitive songs. I love both bands and in my opinion the difference between them is a matter of non-stop brutality vs textured composition. Isis comes at you head on with crazy chuggchuggachugga stylings that make you want to break stuff. Neurosis has that brutality but they'll mix it up with some other tricks now and then. If you don't own any Neurosis or Isis, I recommend both wholeheartedly."
1,Product key was no longer valid due to old sofware!!,"I bought this product on amazon but it turns out the product keys was not valid I call Anonymizer to get another one, they told me "" I don't know why people still selling old software, it's no longer valid"" and they will not help you unless you are purchasing their new software directly from them... you'll need to contact the person who sell it to you if it was not from amazon warehouse you'll lose your money, individual sellers do not refund your money. BE AWARE OR LOSE!"
2,Anonymizer Problems,This software did not interact well with other software on the computer. Speed was severly impacted and several functions simply would not work. I was forced to remove the application.
1,Too many spelling and misinterpretations!,"There are way too many misspellings in this book for it to be useful. The romanized spelling for pronunciation will have the reader speaking incorrectly but even if you know how to read hangeul then this will still not help because many, many of the words are misspelled in hangeul too! It's like they typed up this book very quickly and didn't bother to edit it (or even read it for that matter). Some Korean sentences given in the book combine formal and informal speech in a way that would sound very rude to a native Korean so be careful! One sentence is translated as ""I don't understand Korean"" but actually means ""I speak a little (or some) Korean."" That could be a confusing situation until the Korean you're talking to figures out that you don't really speak Korean! I think everyone would be better off if they just spent a couple of dollars more and bought a secondhand grammar book that has recordings with dialogs."
1,Fossil Men's Watch #BQ9245,The watch arrived promptly but it does not work consistently. it was a gift for my son and he reports that it stops running every few days.
4,aw man - sip some kava tea and try again,"I found this book delightful and intriguing. The characters were vivid and the action swept me away. Try it while listening to Point of Ares' ""Enemy Glory"" CD and you'll be there in person!"
1,Blah.,I read this book yaers ago when it came out in hardcover. I thought it had the coolest cover so I took a chance. Never again will I judge a book by it's cover. One of the worst reads ever. Stay away.
1,self-absorbed,"Dense, self-absorbed, tiresome language. If the author happens to be about 20, and this is her first effort, then she may show promise, once she gets some true life experience and isn't quite so full of post-adolescent self-involvement and angst. If she's over 21, or at the most 25, and writing in the vein of evil-is-so-tragically-glamorous and resonant with deep meaning, then she should get a life. Especially in these times.Fantasy/sci-fi writing can, and has been, wonderfully filled with meaning and beauty. It's one of the more under-appreciated art forms. For a brilliant and meaningful counterpoint to this author's writing, see novels such as Ursula LeGuin's, which are filled with humanity, warmth, imagination, tenderness and meaning. I was, in an odd and silly mood, briefly taken by the title -- how offensive, boring, and what a waste of time the content was."
1,ANNOYING First Person Point of View,"I struggled to complete this book, eventually lost the will to do it, and read the end, which I have to say ranks up there with the WORST I have ever seen. Why do authors do this? First person [writing everything from the author's point of view] is hard to do well, even by experienced, talented authors. From what I can see, Ms. Michalson is neither. The endless droning of what is happening moment to moment made my head rock.I can only suggest that it is offensive to end a book with ""here's the end of one of many stories."" The series doesn't warrant another book, though I suspect the market will be subjected to at least one."
4,"intersting reading, but not of the awareness issues","great reading, but i have to tell you that i am always pressed to educate people of their own nature. i have this very strong power that i now release, and i want to know more about the kind of humans that stay so private, they cannot enjoy life as some of us could. and for this, i take serious my friends earthly time. doesn't anyone stop the analysis?.....being a Y2K person for so many years, this must be an issue for the next mil........jon here, just wondering..."
4,Fairly standard,Not a whole lot to say about these. They're about what you'd expect I think. The sizing is ok.
1,This album stinks,"Wow. This album is awful. If you are just getting into Phish, and you are thinking to yourself, ""Hey, I really liked 'Billy Breathes' and that 'Bouncing Around the Room' is pretty cool, too...maybe I should check out this Dude of Life/Phish CD,"" just stop right where you are, and slowly back away from your computer. It's unimaginative, it's annoying, and you'll regret spending any money at all on it."
4,"Not as good as I thought, but still cool","I had to give this 4 stars, even though it wasn't as good as I was hoping. But I mean, it's still Phish so they deserve it."
1,WARNING: THIS SUCKS,"If you are an phanatical fan of Phish and love them with all of your being, take a lesson here: this is NOT Phish. I have every album and many live tapes. I have seen them countless times live. That being said, I must say that this album really stinks. The Dude of Life can not carry a tune at all. His voice is annoying. What were these guys thinking? Please, if you don't have any Phish albums, DO NOT start here. I took a good friend to a show and a week later he bought this thinking it would reflect his experience of being at a show. He threw it in the garbage. I had to convince him that this was not a Phish record."
3,Fair,"Well first of all Phish's ""Chalkdust Torture"" is a ripp off of the dudes song ""Self,"" not the other way around. Second of all, there are some great songs on the album, and there are some bad ones. Probably worth getting if you are already really into Phish, and collect live tapes."
1,Why oh why did they stoop to this?,"I could list any number of wrong things with this album- from Phish's lack of musicality to the Dude of Life's lack of singing voice. Let me start by sayng that the Dude of Life is responsible for guiding Phish to some of their loonier places in the first two albums (although none of his lyrics appear on the later ones) and some of that lyric voice can be seen here. Unfortunetly, it is set against a back drop of poor music by Phish, clearly missing the lush arrangments of their other songs, and even ripping off songs like ""Chalkdust Torture"" at some moments. Added on to that is the Dude of Life's animal-slaying i-sound-like-a-skinned-cat singing voice which is painful to listen to at best. Leave this one on the shelf, and save yourself some cash."
2,If you like free jazz.....,"It seems that some people have missed the point. This is NOT a Phish album, this is a Dude of Life production. Phish may have lost a bet to play on this creation, but it still displays their talents. This a free jazz album with the odd rock overtone. If you want to open your mind to experimental music then check it out, it flys way out there. If you are looking for a Phish CD this is NOT for you."
2,"Pollack Can Draw, But Singing Ain't His Thing","This album features Phish along with their long-time friend, Steve Pollack (a.k.a. The Dude of Life). Pollack draws all of the illustrations on Phish's merchandise including thier albums. He also is a regular contributor to the lyrics of Phish songs. On this album, Phish tries to utilize his wacky, slightly insane, style in order to create a unique sound. Let me tell you, if your looking for good instrumental music, here it is; as long as you can tune out Pollack's horrible voice. If your looking to buy your first Phish CD, don't buy this one."
4,"not like phish, but great anyway","Ok, this may not be phish, but it's still an awesome album. The lyrics are awesome and the songs are almost ska-like. so don't listen to those who are so totally obsessed with phish that they put down anything with phish's name on it that doesn't sound exactly like them. give it a chance"
4,We have confirmed the fact that this is not Phish!,"Ok, all you phrantic phish phans, we all know this is NOT a Phish album. So, all that aside, let's start actually reviewing the album instead of giving it 1 star simply because it's not a Phish album. Imagine, if you will, if Wesley Willis had ever made a more serious/thoughtful album, yet maintained his goofiness. Eh? Sounds kinda dumb. But this is not. This is a good album, and the music IS made by Phish, so techincally the music is pretty dern solid. I like it."
4,The Dude abides....,"Go into this expecting a comedic album and you'll like it. No, it's not like the rest of Phish's repertoire (as has been pointed out in 100 other reviews) but who cares? There's some pretty funny stuff on here, like ""Bitchin' Again."""
1,this doesn't belong in the 'music' section,"i could have made a better album by recording myself playing harmonica while farting. if you want to listen to good music that has some humour/a unique sound go get a some zappa albums or maybe some primus, if you want to be a faux 'hippy' then stick to phish and their mindless work with artists like ""dude of life."" this album really has nothing positive to offer, i've tried so hard to like this album for almost 2 years now and couldn't bring myself to take a liking to even one song. it's hard to believe that a band that's recorded such landmark albums as junta could disgrace themselves by recording this cd. a definite DO NOT BUY."
5,Realistic texturing class for the rest of us,"Where was this book, when I needed it for my thesis. lolThe whole book is a do-it-yourself class on its own. The steps are laid out very clearly, how you use photoshop for doing textures. I really like the how the book included the character files in obj, dxf, c3d, lwo and 3ds. So that anyone could view the model in any program they use. The book covers the face, the eyes, the gums, the tongue and the teeth in excellent detail. I went throught the book twice with every page being extremely helpful.What did this book do for me as a Maya user, it broke me away from methods I had learned at RIT and suggested more simpler ones without making bumpmaps in the hypershade. Now you can do it all in one texture, and it looks amazing.This book has been a great edition to my 3D collection. I look forward to more of his work in the future. Whats volume 2 going to be about?"
5,This is a book you should not miss,"This is one of best books Bill Fleming has released yet. It gives you great detail on how to fully texture his classic freaky frank character. The directions are simple and offer great insight into creating textures that are very realistic. The book uses Photoshop to complete the texture, but what you learn from it could be used in Deep Paint, Body Paint, or even Z-Brush. Although a bit pricey for the size of the book; the color images, and the information within are more than worth it."
3,the book it's small,"I thougth that the book will be a complete book, of about 200 pages...but it only has about 100 or less and also it doesn't have a big format size.It's more like a very complete tutorial than a complete book of texturing. I think it's much money for just a very complete tutorial....I can found free ones on the net....About the shopper, very good."
1,Bill does indeed strike again. Much to buyers regrets,"What a waste of money. It's barely worth the paper it is written on.There are better and more comprehensive tutorials on the web for free than the nonsense printed here.Fair warning, save your money, don't be ""Fleminged""."
3,Difficult to program,I like the watch and plan to use it for kayaking in the SF Bay area. I am still experiencing trouble programming it however. Perhaps Casio could provide better instructions and/or calculations to set it properly.
2,Way to confusing,To me this watch just has to many functions and is way to confusing to set them all up. I would not purchase this watch again.
3,I hate the LED backlight,"The watch comes with a stupid orange LED backlight. It looks too cheap and is stupid. The 10yr battery life is subject to use of back light for 1.5sec each day and an alarm for not more than a couple of seconds each day. If you use these features more, then the battery life is much less.It's a stupid claim by Casio - 10yr battery life. I will use the backlight and alarms more, I mean anyone would. So it's not going to be 10yrs life. Neways, rest all is good about it. Moon and tide phase are stupid useless features, no one uses."
3,Moon phase is out a bit... otherwise good,"Good watch and easy as to set up if you read the manual (can get it online). The moon age is out by a day constantly though (which effects the tide graph), and it doesn't look like you can adjust this (it calculates from your 'home site data' and date) other than fiddling with GMT time or lunitidal interval values... which isn't ideal and probably isn't accurate either. Apart from that it's a pretty cool watch... just wish it was more accurate with the tides coz I use it for water sports. 5 alarms is good (I struggle to get up sometimes ;), auto light is handy at times. Tide graph is hard to erad when it's low tide coz the display is little. Case isn't all stainless steel either, it's plastic where the band pins join to the case which is a bummer coz it won't be as strong."
4,Cant beat for the $$,"Does as advertised. Good looking watch that is pretty durable for the $$. Tide functions are fairly accurate. Fairly comfortable for daily wear. Sharpish edges where the band meets the crown-but not dangerous. Had a similar Casio Tide watch last year-beat on it fishing, swimming, and working in the yard. I wore it for over a year-now my 4-tear old has it...still works."
5,Great Watch,"This is a great watch. If someone is looking for a watch with multiple options and moon phases etc then this is a watch to look at. Furthermore, for those that do not like heavy watches and feel that they weigh down their arms this is also a great watch. It is very light and you barely feel it when you have it on, which is why I am glad it has a waterproof feature since it has gone in the shower with me on several occasions. ;-)"
2,Irritating,"I have owned several casio watches, and from the reviews I decided to order this one. - It looks nice and feels good to wear. - Unfortunately, I have found it to be quite irritating to use. - It keep changing between the modes (maybe too sensitive buttons?). - Very often the compass-mode (which I have no use for) is the one in the display. More problematic is the fact that the watch has dual time and when mode switches to the alternative time display, the other buttons will easily adjust the time with plus/minus 15 minutes. - Now when I think I am looking at the real time I am actually looking at the alternative time without being aware of this. - This has caused me to miss appointments/transportation. - I have found no way to turn of compass and dual time, and for me this makes this watch unusable. - I will trhow it away."
2,"Too thick, hard to read, tide data very coarse","Probably the best thing about this watch is the look. It doesn't appear as an inexpensive watch. It is very thick - very very thick - almost 1/2 an inch. Not sure why that is.It's got all the std features of a digital want and a ""bearing mode"", which is not a digital compass.The tide/moon graph is fairly worthless. You can tell if you are at low, high, or in between somewhere. Plus is very hard to read without holding up to your eye or turning the light on.I'm sending mine back - you will too if you really need the tide info."
5,My second one,The one piece band is difficult to find and my primary reason to get another. The first one lasted about 5 years of heavy abuse. It is on its's second battery and still runs. I wore out one of the right side push buttons and feared that I may have compromised the water resistance when I wear it swimming.
3,Different!,"I bought this watch because it had the moon phase and tide graph, they work great, but aren't very useful here in Charlotte, NC.The watch body is made of ""resin"" (plastic), so we can probably expect the watch pins to easily pull free."
5,i absolutly love this thing...,"title says it all. this watch is absolutley perfect. Im a cable guy so I bump and bang it around constantly with no probs. i only use it for the date / time, so all the tide features are useless to me.. i just love it cuz it looks sharp and keeps the time like a champ. i will be getting another the minute that i break this one.BUT be prepared - if u buy this, u WILL have to go to a jewler to get it sized for you. they will take out a link or 2, but it only costs about 10 bucks."
3,Good value,"I wasn't expecting much for $30, so when this watch arrived at my doorstep, I wasn't disappointed. If I had paid $100+ for this time piece, I would be disappointed with the rigidity of the bracelet and the satin finish of the metal but for $30, it looks good and functions pretty well. Yes, the back light is lame."
3,no indiglo or night setting.,"I like the fit and style of this watch, but I am a disapointed in a few features. The backlight is not indiglo, and is pretty faint. Also, unlike timex watches, there is no way to keep the face lit as you change settings, set alarms,etc (or, least I haven't figured it out yet). Basically makes it impossible to work in the dark. Might not be a big deal for some, but I need to be able to set and reset alarms and timers outside at night. Otherwise, it's a nice watch."
3,Loved the love story in this...,"This would make a charming love story if it weren't so bogged down in the ""seedy"" plot. Colin Firth plays Joe Prince who obviously adores his wife even though she is neurotic, psychotic, and generally unlovable. He searches for her following her abrupt disappearence only three days after their wedding, finds out all kinds of less-than-wholesome things about her, then continues to look for her anyway. Although it is a charming idea, I am not sure how realistic this might actually be. Guys like this are so rare that they must already be in heaven. No matter what, Colin Firth is first-rate (as always), his friend, Elijah, played by Billy Zane, is also done very well, but the rest of the cast rates a C- or even lower. I would watch it again to focus only on the romantic scenes, and fast-forward over the rest."
3,Better than the cover suggests,"I wish I could have given this movie 5 stars, but I am biased. Joseph Prince is, in my opinion Colin Firth's most charming character (and I always think he deserves 5 stars!). Lisa Zane is convincing, as is the man who plays her father. Billy Zane is believable as Joe's bud. Overall, the story is mediocre as is the rest of the cast. However, there are some touching and some laugh-out-loud scenes which make this a movie worth watching."
2,Only for the true Firth fan.,It's not easy to be a Colin Firth fan when he has movies such as this one. He is the only redeeming factor in this film. His proposal to the crazy woman is worth the cost of adding this movie to your collection. I fail to see why anyone who is not a fan of CF would bother with this one.
1,If only I could give a zero,"The translation was melodramatic at best. The cultural note stating that an ancient chinese coin was worth about $1.40 was painful. My question was: ""Is that in Ancient American Dollars?""The artwork was good, but could not compensate for the piss poor narration and atrocious dialogue. I did not find the action to be particularly imaginative."
1,Great Gag Gift,"If you have friend who's a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fanatic, manga/comic book lover, this would be a great gag gift. Page after page of hilariously bad dialogue. Spitting out horrible line after horrible line. The drawing isn't the greatest either. the characters have huge foreheads and bodies sometimes out of proportion. If nothing else, the only redeeming quality about this horrible exploitation of a movie franchise, is the main male character proclaims something along the lines of: 'She is sixteen, She is Perfect!'"
5,That Tulsa Sound - Still great after all these years,"J J Cale was the king of 'laid back' in the '70's when everyone else was quite the opposite. I fell in love with this album around 1975-76 when I was living in Boulder, Colorado. Thru the years, even though I often found myself singing some of these songs in my head, I lost my orig LP version. Now I have finally replaced it with this CD. I am happy I did because it is still great and absolutely worth the crazy low price!"
5,desert island disc,"J.J. Cale's Troubadour is a timeless recording of the highest caliber. As a music lover with an extensive portfolio of rock, blues, roots, soul, jazz, and classical, this is a CD that gets played regularly. Troubadour immediately connects with the listener and will prompt friends to inquire about the artist creating the cool, laid-back sound. This is one of those ten desert island discs to consider owning. Highly recommended."
4,Armies of Ivan the Terrible,"I cannot vouch for the historical accuracy of this book, but its content is presented in a concise and readable fashion, and it is well-endowed with excellent plates by Angus McBride. This title seems to be another humorous case of David Nicolle's habit of naming books covering a several century span after one man (as he did with Attila, Arthur, Saladin, and El Cid)."
1,you owe me a star,"I read this collection of short stories on my summer vaction.They are unimaginative ,over burdened with a incredible amount of adjectives and just plain boring.Most stories seem to have been gleamed from old twilight zone plots,especially ""DIE POODLES DIE"".The author needs to develop a style of his own,and some idea's of his own"
1,Murder me before dinner!,"As a well-read person, I found the book Murder Over Dinner, a collection of short stories, to be amateurish, at best. The plots are thread-bare and unoriginal. The characters are one-dimensional and predictable. Any story that even comes close to being interesting is ""Twilight Zone-esque"" and is likely borrowed directly from an episode of the classic TV series. The author is incapable of holding any semblance of intrigue or suspense past the first paragraph in most of the stories. I typically enjoy a suspenseful story line with interesting characters, quirky plot twists, and a surprise ending. I found none of that in J.P. Taylor's Murder Over Dinner. I wouldn't recommend this reading experience to anyone. In stark contrast to the suspicious ""reviews"" printed on the book's back cover, I feel that the author definitely does disappoint!"
4,An Interesting Collection,"I read this book on summer vacation as well, and I enjoyed it. The twelve stories moved quickly, were fun to read, and easy to digest. I found them interesting, and not boring at all. I am an avid ""Twilight Zone"" fan, and I enjoyed the fact that a couple of the stories were definitely inspired by the old show. In fact, I would have liked more, since only two or three fit that description. And in contrast to the previous review, I know that old series very well, and none of the storylines were lifted. In this day and age, it is very frustrating to watch television and see the same tired old things (i.e. the rogue cop who plays by his own rules; the person selling their soul to satan; endless remakes of bad sixties TV shows, etc.). This book, while definitely a first effort, provided some fresh things, and for that it was worth the time and effort."
4,Bizarre and Funny!,"This first-time author does a good job. I enjoy short stories because of my busy schedule, so this was perfect. The writer's style is very simple and straightforward, and I enjoyed it. The book has satire, humor, and twists, and it displayed a lot of original imagination. Romances and mysteries bore me to tears, so this was a welcome change. I recommend it."
2,What's the point?,"I don't know about you all, but i'm a bit baffled as to why whoever Clapton's old record lable have kept this on the market - after releasing 'The Cream of Clapton'. All but one of these songs is included on the latter, plus several of his Cream tracks.Sure the songs are okay - the radio friendly ones - it's just the stupidity of the compliationo.I don't know about you all, but it seems just a bit dodgy the way you can still buy 'Timepieces', 'Backtrackin', 'The cReam of Claption' and 'Crossroads. He has almost as many compilations as studio albums!Buy 'The cream of Clapton' instead."
3,Why this is really really cheap used..,"Simple...it's obsolete. THE CREAM OF CLAPTON (ASIN B000001EEA) covers a longer time period (1966-1981) with more songs (19 compared to this set's 11), it's remastered and with a better selection of great tunes from the Slowhand.PROS:If your two favourite Clapton tunes are ""Willie and the Hand Jive"" and ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot"", buy this one.It's really, really, really cheap used if you don't have a lot of $$$ to spend on your music.CONS:Shorter run time, inferior sound quality, no songs from Blind Faith or Cream. No songs from after 1978Except the 2 mentioned above, all these songs are on THE CREAM OF CLAPTON and then some.BOTTOM LINE:Don't buy this one...save up your money and get THE CREAM OF CLAPTON instead."
5,Track Listing,1. I Shot the Sheriff2. After Midnight3. Knockin' On Heaven's Door4. Wonderful Tonight5. Layla6. Cocaine7. Lay Down Sally8. Willie And The Hand Jive9. Promises10. Swing Low Sweet Chariot11. Let It Grow
2,A Lacking Album,"This album lacks a lot. I don't really want to go into detail, but trust me. Get the cream of clapton istead."
3,Not Very Good,"I was highly disappointed with this Clapton Compilation. The only songs I particularly like were ""Layla"", ""Cocaine"", and ""I Shot The Sheriff"".I am sorry, people; ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is a terrible song. The best of Clapton? Generally the ""best"" of someone means their ""best"" songs! Also cut out ""Willie and the Hand Jive"", ""Wonderful Tonight"", and a few others.If it weren't for the 3 songs I mentioned previously, this album would be trash."
2,well well well,"i try to avoid this album at all costs. i mean, don't get me wrong, i REALLY REALLY REALLY love the sugarcubes, but this album just stinks like monkey poo. granted, there are some ultra gorgeous songs on here (a grand total of two), but for the most part... well i don't want to sound redundant."
3,Fun,"This album is so misunderstood. It's all about fun. ""Leash Called Love"" is a great pop song. Along with the single ""Hit"" and ""Gold"". The band does not sound as excited as on their debut but i dare you to put ""Vitamin"" on without smiling. And ""Chihuahua"" though a throwaway ending has Bjork sounding extra cute. It's not essential but it's not the disappointing Here Today Tomorrow Next Week."
5,Great snack product for emergencies,"I have eaten these over the last ten years or so, and they are great. They only have 110 calories, have some protein and some fiber. This is one of the few nutritional ""snack bars"" that tastes good (at least to me). Unfortunately there isn't too much there, so for me, I sometimes splurge and have two of them at a time (what a rush). Too many ""power bars and other such items have a lot of calories and not that much fiber. I prefer a healthy alternative (nuts are another good choice) to eating something like a candy bar (a sugar empty snack). The downside of these crisp bars is don't get them too warm (like in the back of a car for a few hours with the temps in the 90's) or you will have a melted crisp, not as tasty, and not as easy to get out of the wrapper."
5,Yummy with lots of protein,Great power bar type of food with fewer calories than most (it has 110) and does NOT taste like cardboard! Good amounts of fiber and protein.
3,"Good, but ChocMint is better :P","These (in any flavor) are great to have along when you need to skip a real meal. I especially love the chocolate-mint bars. These vanilla ones have a good taste, but the outside coating seems to melt more easily than the mint bars. Often I will find the vanilla bars in a melted mushy mess while the mint bars remain unaffected. So, vanilla are okay if you aren't taking them out anywhere; especially don't leave them in your pocket."
3,Such a love fest,"For all the talk of China abandoning the practice of personality worshipping its leaders, here comes a non-Chinese citizen engaging in a veritable Jiang Zemin love fest. A nice introduction to the cast of characters in contemporary, post-Cultural Revolution China, but otherwise lacking in value as a serious reference book."
1,Trash!,This digital camera can not be used to take photos from a distance; you have to literally place the camera right infront of your face just so that the picture comes out good. That is unacceptable! It does nothing more than take up space.
4,Just as expected.,"This item looks and functions just as you would expect and just as is shown in the picture. I have not had any problems with it. The only thing to consider is the size addition. You will need some space to add this puppy. It measures over 2 and a half inches tall and almost 3 inches wide. By the time you screw 2 bulbs into it, you're looking at a total width of over 7 inches and a height of almost 6 inches. You won't be fitting that tiny lamp shade back over this fixture. Make sure you are either going somewhere with plenty of clearance to fit it all together."
2,No moving pictures,"I bought this video for my son, six years old, who is learning Spanish. I wanted him to have some Latin folk tales in Spanish. However, this video has no moving pictures. It consists of Spanish narration and still pictures that don't even change very often. I did not think my son would be interested in watching it. It could be OK for older kids or adults."
3,"Hey, I remember this from the second grade!","This is one of those sweet, simple, obscure stories from childhood. A little boy and his parents live near a kind elderly woman who is never seen without her sunbonnet; it's even presumed that she wears it to bed at night. She has to leave home for a short while, and asks her neighbors if they'll milk her cow while she's gone. They gladly oblige. First Dad gives it a try, and the cow kicks him. Mom assumes the cow doesn't like men, and she tries, but the cow kicks her. The little boy recalls that the cow's owner swapped her sunbonnet for a fancy traveling hat. He guesses the cow is just as accustomed to the bonnet as everyone else. Turns out he's right, and it is he who answers the title's question. Good bedtime story book, or for reading practice for little ones."
2,Kiddies Kiddies everywhere,"This short series could have been better, I don't understand why the Japanese feel the need to have all the main characters children or little girls, Of course this is not true for Macros Plus which is one of the best animation out there, maybe it's because they left the kids at home."
2,Great American Houses and Gardens,"This could have been a fantastic pop-up and when I first examined it, I thought it was. Unfortunately, the pop-ups don't 'pop'; you literally have to open them. My first reaction was that the book was stiff because of the newness but it has not gotten better. My second disappointment is the lack of gardens; this is essentially the houses. If anyone wants a pop-up for the gardens, get the one about Monet's Garden; it is great."
3,misleading size,"I ordered a 34 D since my underbust measurement is 34"". This bra is WAY TOO SMALL. When I measure it (laying it out flat granted, not stretching it) it measures 26"" (can get it to 28"" by pulling it). The extender that comes with only adds 2"" to this underbust measurement. Now, I know these garments are supposed to fit snugly, but I don't have THAT MUCH room for reduction around my rib cage! I had read other reviews for this before buying and at least one says that it runs large, so now I don't know if maybe I got one incorrectly labeled. I was going to exchange for a bigger size, but I am now worried that it may not work either. Too bad because it looks really well-made."
2,More of a reference guide,"I bought this book thinking it was more of a pregnancy guide for my teenage daughter. What it turned out to be was more of a reference guide for things like adoption, abortion and abandonment. It had a few short personal stories for each section. Definately not a book for a teen who plans to keep her baby."
5,DONT BUY THIS CD,LIsten everybody she has a great voice but dont buy the CD she dosent make any money off of it and plus it is on Walock records?Yeah thats right it is from a different company dont buy this cd unless you see an rca symbol on it okay? Christna has agreat voice but i didnt buy this CD because i knew there was something about why she didnt advertise or promote it so dont buy it OKAY!
3,I'd Skip This One...,"This was Christina's demo, all vocals by her at the age of 14.The songs are bland, not well thought out. The only song I think is worth listening to is ""Believe Me,"" other then that the songs are bland and average.Christina actually protested for them NOT to release this...now I can understand why. All the songs were left just the way they were and they're not that good, but Christina still has great vocals.I'd skip this and pick up Stripped instead."
4,Christina Was Amazing at Such a Young Age!,"Christina recorded these tracks at the ages of 14 and 15. Don't let that drive you away though, because she sounds just as amazing as on her two professional albums. Better, maybe.Just be Free-5/5By Your Side-5/5Move it (Dance mix)-5/5Our Day Will Come-4/5Believe me-5/5Make me Happy-5/5Dream a Dream-1/5Move it-4/5The Way you Talk to me-3/5Running out of Time-3/5Believe me (Dance mix)-5/5Just be Free (Spanish)-5/5AVERAGE RATING-4/5"
1,HAHAHA!!! Don't make me laugh!!!,"C'mon, one has to be more pragmatic and dispassionate point of view when writing a review... The album really is terrible, believe me... The only thing that can instigate me to buy this album is the cd cover... Even Christina Aguilera's fans will be disappointed by the lack of tune in the songs...By the way, her name is spelled as C-H-R-I-S-T-I-N-A, not CHRISITNA...Sorry to say this, but you would really have to be damn gullible and credulous to buy album. It's a letdown..."
5,Refreshing,"When I first saw this album I thought it wasn't going to be that good. But I think it is the best work she has done. The name of the album says it all, ""Just Be Free"". Most of these songs should have been on her record or on b-sides of her singles of her first album. I think the best songs are, ""Believe me"", ""Make me happy"", ""The way you talk to me"" and ""Just be free (Spanish version)"". That's pretty good for a demo.I love this album better than ""Stripped"". I am glad her old manager decided to release this album."
1,Early 90's,"I decided to download the tracks to this CD before actually buying it. Good thing I did. Anyone who wasted their money on this cd, I feel bad for you. It sounds like a cd composed of all early 90's tracks (""You Make Me Happy"" for example). I mean, sure songs like that were great back then, but now... I think you see what I'm saying."
1,Just Be Free,"I hate every song on this album, its awful and she knew it. I feel sorry for her, because other artists don't have to show their earlier work. Of course she's grown as an artist and person, and her views and tastes have changed. Demos aren't supposed to be incredible, its to give labels an idea of your ability. This shows that she has a nice sound, for a 14-15 year old, and a pretty face. It all worked out, and if you supported her before her earlier work came out, you still should. This isn't new material."
1,She is free alright with bad music!,This cd is not going to sell well to the general overall thought of this cd its ashame that they even spent the money to put this cd out on the selfs. I just might tell my friends to get it so that the record company will make a few dollars off the whole deal. Her next cd should be amazing and everybody has there down time.
1,Absolutely DISGUSTING,"This is a horrible album, if you can CALL it an album. Don't get me wrong; Christina's voice isn't horrible in it. It definitley isn't as good as on her two following albums, but it's not bad. It's just untrained. What makes this 'album' horrible and repulsive is the style of the music: CHEEZY! It's horribly repetitive in its tackiness...each song is pure torture.But the crown jewel of this sad excuse for an album is the Spanish version of ""Just Be Free."" We all know that Christina has Latin roots. Hey, her last name is AGUILERA for pity sakes! But this song proves that she hadn't had ANY coaching on pronunciation or rythym for Spanish words...it's laughable at best.Please don't buy this."
3,Truthfully.......,"This is a demo recorded at an early age and to sum my feelings up about this record, I would say that her voice and some of the songs are better than Britney's today."
1,POOR CHRISTINA.... HOW EMBARASSING!!!,"I'm a big Christina Aguilera fan and when I heard her new album was released, I had to get it. But I noticed the album cover wasn't quite appealing and it didnt really look...""Christina Aguilera-ish"" if you will. But I decided to get it. THE ALBUM SUCKS!!! The music sounds repetitive and the quality is real BAD!!! Don't waste your money.. I was so disappointed and almost felt embarassed for her since the producers allowed this to be released. >=("
1,There's A Reason Why Christina Tried To Stop The Release,"This album is completely awful - Buyer Beware!!!! Christina Aguilera filed a law suit agains the record label to try and stop the release of this album - This album was put together from Christina's practice sessions before she actuall got a record deal - And of coarse to try and make money off Christina, they released this album anyway - So even though this is a terrible cheesy put together, I don't blame Christina for it -"
1,Very Disapointing,"All the songs seemed to sound the same. There was no context. It was just like hearing the same song over and over again, except with different words."
5,this album is great,"hello, i want to start by saying that don't take on count the bad comentaries, 'bout this album, some people is saying it's horrible, but that's not true, it's a great work o christina, as eeverything she does, if you have the oportunity to buy it, do it, you'll be so glad, because her voice and her singing way is amazing, i'm the chrisitna's no. 1 fan, and i love her, so please buy her album, it's great, it's rithyms are so pretty, specially the ""move it"" song, also just be free song is amazing.wll goodbye"
1,Good . . . if you like 12 songs that sound exactly the same,"I loved Christina's first CD. But this one sounded like all the same songs. And yeah, they have a good beat and good sound, but I prefer VARIETY!!"
1,This is really bad!,"What has this child done to ""Our Day Will Come?"" Its hardly recognizable. Its just really bad."
4,Unauthorized but GOOD!,"I don't know why Christina tried SO hard to block the release of these recordings!! She was an amazing vocalist even at 14!! I downloaded some of these songs off the 'net and was so amazed I went and bought the CD!! And I was not disappointed. Although you can tell that Christina didn't have the benefit for a full professional studio, the quality is quite good."
2,Boring!!!!!!,"Where should I start? Its obvious why Christina didn't want this record released, but it does have some good parts. Just Be Free is a decent song, and both versions of Move It were nice, especially the dance remix, which I found myself listening to more than once. From there, it goes down. I fell asleep during the other songs, so I dont remember what they were called... So unless you are a hardcore Christina fan, I dont recommend purchasing this album."
2,Nothing like her debut album...,"When I first heard just be free via the internet, I thought it was a pretty cool song, so I went out and got this cd. The only songs I think are good are just be free(original), by your side, our day will come, believe me, and dream a dream is ""so-so"". The only thing I don't like about dream a dream is the backup singers on the chorus. They remind me of The Three Tenors or something along those lines. After dream a dream it all really goes downhill. I think she still sings well like she does now, but half the tracks sound like you're listening to one super-long song. They don't really stand out. I can't really blame Christina for not wanting this album on the market. Well, that's my honest review. Hope it helps you out!=0)"
1,How Embarissing For Christina,"I'm a fan of Christina Aguilera's albums released on RCA, but this one is just terrible. There's a good reason she didn't want this released! The songs are scrambled, and the vocals are pitchy. The intial tune of the songs are bad, and Christina doesn't even look attractive on the cover. (Which shouldn't matter but everyone knows it does.) Maybe it would make a good frisby."
2,(...) I'm so glad it's not her latest work!!!,"Ok, first I heard of her was when she did a TRL and sang ""So Emotional"". I was in the other room and heard her, (...) The exuberance, charm, wit and style,musicality and power of that CD is NOWHERE to be found on this waste of plastic. The culprits are the (...) songs that she's singing, and the obscene lack of any appreciable music quality, rather than her vocals, which are pretty decent. The people who are responsible for distributing this...reeking piece of moose flatulence...really did her a disservice.I'm SO happy this isn't indicative of her many many talents, and I look forward to her new project with the anticipation of enjoying it as thoroughly as I did her last one. Rock On...."
4,Man on the Moon,"This is a great book for children. It can interest your child in space travel, astronauts or the moon. Suen easily explains the first landing on the moon that is understandable for children. Children learn the names of the first three astronauts that were on the flight and other information that can be useful to them. The illustrations complement the text on every page. The Author's Note is an added extra. A must share/buy for anyone who remembers when man landed on the moon."
1,A real lame rip-off,"I was about to send you a letter asking WHO approved this ""so called"" book. It could have been put togetherby a five year old, just clipping newspaper headlines. I purchased three of them to use in my briefing onSPACE to 2nd and 3rd graders. They knew much more about the moon landing than was in this book (for$6. or $7. bucks) Doesn't anyone in your organization review these things ? It is not so much about themoney, as it was about my embarrassment, and the time spent gathering some REAL material at the lastminute. This is too serious a historical event to be given such a sloppy, inane excuse for a book... Get abetter reviewer, PUULLLEEEZ. Ann Dickson"
3,Good Companion to Dolan's book....,"An excellent ""overview and introduction"" to American Catholicism. Read along with J. Dolan's Catholicism studies."
3,Pants for Any Body,"I would suggest the ""Pants For Real People"" instead by the same authors. It is more comprehensive than this little book."
3,it doesn't work for me,"I've tried the methods of this book, but they seem to work only for slight modifcation as most of the suggested modifications are done on side seam and at the waist. I give it 3 stars as some tricks described in the book are useful. I recommended drapping to get perfectly fitted pants, you can do it on yourself with 4 pieces of fabric (with marked grainlines and other reference lines). It's a veeeery time consuming process however."
2,Now I remember why...,"I bought this book when it first came out because it was highly recommended. I followed all the steps, but the pants I was making just looked progressively worse the further along in the process I got. Up until then, I had been feeling like my sewing skills were coming right along, and had really been enjoying getting back into sewing. I never did finish those pants, or do any other sewing except repairs from then until this summer. Talk about a killjoy!"
2,Mildly amusing college hijinks flick,"If you're looking for the the hilarious film about Austin oddballs, THIS AIN'T IT. Richard Linklater's opus (1991) is Slacker (without the final S).Given that this one's about a trio of smug middle-class cheaters, I suppose the rip-off title is in keeping with the movie's theme."
1,Not to be confused with 'Slacker',"Sophomoric hijinx that fail to score many points in the way of comedy. It was a disappointment to see Jason Schwartzman reduced to playing a gross parody of his 'Rushmore' role in this pathetic film, which barely lifts itself above bathroom humor, and then falls flat on its face once more. The object of desire in this peurile flick is Jamie King, who finds herself caught between a pscyhopathic nerd (Schwartzman) and a two-bit con artist (Sawa). You decide whose worse, but since this film is told entirely from the POV of the two-bit con artist you can guess who wins in the end. While it provides fodder for the overstretched Comedy Network, it is hardly worth buying on DVD."
1,Worst film of 2002?,"It's got my vote. Mercifully, it only runs for about 80 minutes; but it is long and painful 80 minutes.It is an unrelenting series of unfunny, mean-spirited ""gags"" without a shred of narrative cohesion and not a single likeable character. If you enjoyed movies like American Pie, There's Something About Mary, Road Trip or Van Wilder; avoid this stinker at all costs, it is nothing like any of those films."
3,Funny...sort of.,"Slackers is pretty much your average college romp film, only in this case, the bottom line is ""Love brings out the best in people, even cheaters."" A fairly well cast movie (especially Jason Schwartzman as a quasi-psychotic stalker, trapped in the persona of a campus geek), the story held some definite possibilities, but the movie really doesn't provide anything more than an interesting way to kill about 90 minutes. Not overly side splitting, as was Animal House, but not a complete waste of celluloid either, I found myself laughing out loud during a few scenes (most of which included Schwartzman and cameo players Mamie Van Doren and Cameron Diaz). So...if you're looking for the next academy award winner, this isn't it. If you have an hour and a half to burn, and enjoy fluff movies, this movie will probably sit alright with you. The DVD is devoid of special features, so unless you just have a penchant for collecting campus comedies, I would just stick with renting this one."
3,Grade of B+,"The comedy Slackers features Devon Sawa, James King, and Jason Schwartzman. It also has Laura Prepon, Jason Segel, and Michael Maronna. Dave (Sawa) and his friends do many wacky things just to cheat their way through collage. Then Dave made his fatal mistake, having an arguement with Ethan (Schwartzman) over a seat. Ethan discovers Dave cheating and blackmails him. Ethan wants Dave and his two friends to help him get a girl, Angela (King).Slackers is an okay comedy. The plot is something different from other teen comedies that have been getting created lately. Even though it made less than five million dollars at the box office (4.8 million to be technical), you may find it as the unexpected hit comedy you've been looking for. You might also find it to be a horrible film. (See it if you like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) I give Slackers a CAUTIOUS recommendation."
2,.. I give it 3 stars... just for Jason....,"The plot was unoriginal and it was somewhat corny. I mean, in a span of a week or two, characters fall in love, other seeks revenge. Yadda yadda. It's a typical teen movie with the same gags and the same basic plot going on. It was predictable and the ending was just weird... I could tell you, some parts of the movie were off and incomplete. I only give it 2 stars because Jason Schwartzman is funny and good at acting like a psycho stalker.If anything, Jason is the only thing that saved this movie."
2,A let down in more ways than one,"The movie overall was bad. It had a pretty weak plot. The casting was overall good (note cameron diaz has an interesting cameo) But if you like stupid fun, then this movie is for you. If you saw it in the theater and wanted to rent it to see if more good/sick stuff was cut out. Don't bother. I guess since it didn't make much money, the company thought no one would rent it either. There are no extra features. I was very disappointed about that."
1,ewhh,"This movie was just nasty. A couple of descent parts, but other than that it was just low-class nasty... and I got it for free!!!! It wasn't even worth it free."
1,Lame,"Any movie that has to steal the title of an already well-known movie must have very little going for it. These teen stars know that they're dime-a-dozen, and are hoping to make money to get them through the years when they're over 25 and unemployed again.Boo! Boo! This is going to stink!"
5,Another Great Teen Movie,This is going to be another hit teen movie. Devon Sawa is a great young actor and his movie idle hands was hilarious and Final destination was great. I predict another hit by Devon.
3,An upright hillarious movie.,"I never even knew that this movie existed untill a month ago, and I can't quite thinking about how funny the movie is. I find most of the jokes in this movie very funny for the simple fact that stuff like cheating, and meeting absolute crazy people really happens almost everyday on almost any campus. It's a hillarious movie with a cheezy romantic side to it, but the comedy of the movie is still worth buying this."
5,Classic and fresh J.J.Cale,"""Shades"" is classic and fresh Cale. J.J. usually supplies consistently good music, but with ""Shades"" we are given a Cale album with added excuberance. There are the characteristic low, breathy, mellow grooves of songs like ""Deep Dark Dungeon"" and ""Pack My Jack"", full of Cale's nonchalant wisdom. Then we have the sweet tones of love songs like ""Wish I Had Not Said That"", reminiscent of the tenderness of ""Magnolia"". There is the dry, natural humour of ""Mama Don't"", and the positive punch of ""Carry On"". To top it all off there is the instrumental, ""Cloudy Day"", which needs no lyrical assistance for its evocation of melancholy. The musicianship on ""Shades"" is superb, and the quality of the production is good. The music has a natural and relaxed feel to it, and includes a variety of styles, from country-rock to cool jazz-blues. Excellent album. Very pleasing to the palate!"
1,Coffee Masters Jamaican Me Crazy Flavored coffee,"Coffee Masters Flavored Coffee, Jamaican Me Crazy, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4). This coffee had no flavor and didn't taste like the real thing. I will not buy this brand again..."
1,Choking hazard,"I tried this for the first time today with my 8.5 month old grandson and within one minute a piece about the size of a half dollar broke off in his mouth and became lodged in his throat. He started turning off color and couldn't breath. I lifted him out of his high chair hoping that might dislodge the piece but it did not. I then tried the modified heimlich for babies twice and it didn't work. Finally, I put my finger in his mouth and had to go all the way to his throat to reach and grab the piece he was choking on. Thankfully that worked, but I still am freaked out - more than 8 hours later. My grandson means the world to me and I can't imagine anything bad happening to him. Don't buy these biscuits, don't use these biscuits."
1,"very brittle, breaks much too easily, choking hazard","I was definately expecting a better product from earth's best. However, these biscuits were not good at all. My son who only has 2 teeth broke these very easily. I will not be buying them again."
1,Choking Hazard,"These teething biscuits are supposed to be hard enough for baby to gnaw on and not have it break off into pieces. About a couple minutes after my son sucks on the biscuit, it softens, and he's able to break off very large pieces into his mouth. Luckily, I was right there watching and was able to retrieve the huge chunk out of his mouth. This is just not safe. I do not recommend these teething biscuits."
3,Ok For Us,"I've been giving these to my 8 month old off and on for a few weeks. They're ok. We haven't had any choking incidents. She sucks on them and they spread goo everywhere, but that's the tale of all teething cookies. Their texture reminds me of dog biscuits. Very dense. They taste a lot like graham crackers. I bought them because barley sounded healthier than rice and we've enjoyed the jars of Earth's Best baby food. They last a long time. The box is still more than half full. She likes the Mum Mum rice rusks better and those are what I'll be buying in the future."
1,COULD BREAK INTO PIECES --> CHOKING HAZARD !!,Other 1* or 2* reviews are correct. This products is a choking hazard itself.These biscuits shouldn't even be given to babies. My nephew is 9 months old and according to the description should be able to try these biscuits. He is starting to grab stuff and eat more solid foods.My nephew had one and the biscuit broke off. Lucky he was able to cough it out himself. NOT recommended for babies.I don't understand why it would even be approved to be on the market for babies. It's more like an adult biscuit.
1,Choking hazard,"We use a lot of Earth's Best products and are quite happy with most of them. Not so these teething biscuits. My daughter fulfilled all the ""requirements"" listed on the box, e.g. she can crawl, gums food, etc., but she still got a big piece of these stuck in her throat and started chocking. There is nothing more scary than finding your nanny hold your child upside down trying to get a piece of food out.I don't recommend these. They should be recalled, or at least not called ""teething"" biscuits, more like ""toddler"" biscuits."
1,DANGEROUS!,"My son almost choked to death on one of these. Instead of slowly dissolving they break apart in large chunks. I would pull them out of his mouth whenever one broke off but today he managed to swallow it before I could get it out and it was nearly lethal. The biscuits are wide and flat. The pieces that break off have sharp corners. The piece that he swallowed was completely blocking his windpipe and because of the sharp corners it was nearly impossible to get out. Baby heimlich did not work. I had to stick two fingers all the way down his throat, carefully dislodge it and pinch it between my fingers to get it out. He is 13 months and eats all kinds of crackers and other solids. These should be taken off the market."
4,My 16 month old and I eat these.,"My little one has been eating these since she was about 10 months old. She didn't like the wheat ones and frankly, I like these barley ones better too. Good thing they come in twos. We like to share them. It is a choking hazard but like most foods, you have to be vigilant and supervise. For some reason, I thought these that I received via Amazon were not as hard as the ones I got at the store. I was worried about the expiration dates since I ordered a pack of 12 boxes but then, I am eating them too so I'm sure they'll be gone by 2/09. What I find amusing is the ""evaporated cane juice"" that is listed in the ingredients of health foods these days (not just these biscuits). Isn't that simply sugar? Aside from that, I thought these were healthier alternative to a lot of toddler snacks out there anyway, so I gave it 4 stars."
1,Definite choking hazard for teething babies,"My 1 year old has choked on these biscuits - he is old enough to feed himself cereal pieces, baby mum-mums, etc. but choked within 1 minute of eating these biscuits. They are hard enough that when they break off in a baby's mouth, the pieces still stay big and hard rather than dissolving like baby puffs or mum-mum biscuits, and the big pieces immediately get caught in the back of the throat. I might keep the box around and give them to him when he's much bigger, but then it should be marketed towards toddlers who can eat them safely, definitely not to teething babies. DANGEROUS!"
2,"Tasty, but too dangerous for teething","While these little biscuits are quite tasty and my 9 month old LOVED the first one I gave her, it will be some time before she gets another one. Within a minute or two the biscuit had broken into pieces just the right size for her to choke on. These are not the sort of teething biscuits I was looking for."
2,Biscuit broke very soon after chewing on it,"My son is 5 months old and teething (no teeth yet). The first and second time we gave him these biscuits, they broke into several pieces within about 20 minutes, one time leaving a big chokeable piece in his mouth. I think they are too thin and not sturdy enough to be used for gumming/sucking."
2,Choking Hazard - Beware,"My 10 month old has two teeth coming in on top and three on the bottom. He eats cheerios, gerber puffs, soft cooked vegetables and ripe fruit with very little problem. I tried the Earth's Best barley biscuits because he is prone to food allergies and I wanted to avoid wheat. Every time I gave him one of these biscuits (3 times) he was able to bite off too big a piece and gagged, not to the point of actually choking, but enough to send me into a panic watching him struggle and turn red. They don't seem to dissolve in his mouth fast enough. On the upside they taste good without being overly sweet. I think they are better suited for a little older babies who have more teeth and have really mastered chewing. I will try the Mum Mum rusks as a previous review suggested."
2,Beware,"Please be very careful of this buscuit, it is too thin, a baby biscuit is supposed to be hard and melt upon contact and not be breaking off in chunks enough to choke the baby. Just the thin look was scary to me and was later confirmed.Looks more suitable to a toddler."
3,"Great Ingredients, Super Messy, and Easy to Choke On","I really, really wanted these to work. They have fantastic ingredients, they taste great, and they're hard... to start off with. Once my 9 month old baby starts chewing on these, they get soft, squishy, and on every single thing they get near. They're perfect if your kid is in a high chair with a bib and can have a bath afterward. The other downside is that they do break off in big chunks and it's easy for the baby to bite off more than he can handle. I'll keep using these when my son is a little older because I think they're probably better suited for an older baby who is teething, rather than someone under a year."
3,Turns into a sticky mess; may be a choking hazard,"Let me first say that my daughter loves these from when she was 6 months old. They are tasty and fun for her to eat; that's not the problem.After having been gummed for only a short time, these biscuits turn into a gluey, sticky mess. It's amazing how tenaciously the goop sticks to mom, baby, clothes and anything else in the vicinity. Be ready with several wet naps or a clothing change if you give these as a snack.Second, and more importantly, they are HARD. When my daughter is 3/4 finished with hers, she stuffs the whole thing in her mouth. It will not dissolve, and instead becomes a rather large (in my opinion) choking hazard. I will note that I have never had a choking incident with the product. However, when I give her these biscuits I monitor her closely and take it away from her when about a quarter of it is left."
1,They break easily,"My daughter is 10 months old and she almost choked yesterday when trying these cookies. She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate. We were able to retrieve it but it was scary and VERY dangerous. The first box I got at Whole Foods contained several cookies that had broken into pieces, I should have known better. Do not use this product if you have a young baby as it is extremely dangerous."
2,Be careful,"I gave one of these to my 1-year old who only has 2 teeth but is teething like crazy. Less than 2 minutes later a piece over an inch long broke off in her mouth. I pulled it out and she was fine, but I didn't expect it to break that easily. She obviously loved the taste and feel because she grabbed the rest and started in again. They are incredibly messy but seem to serve their purpose. Definitely don't give these unsupervised, though."
1,Choking Hazard!!!!,"I gave one of these to my 9 month old (with 9 teeth albeit!) last night, and he choked!! Of course I assumed they'd dissolve like other teething biscuits and didn't try it for myself first. Thankfully I was right there and by the time I had flipped him over and got him in position to try and get it out, he started coughing and crying, but I hate to think what could have happened if I couldn't get it out! If your baby already has teeth and can break pieces off - buyer beware. I tried it for myself afterwards and these do not dissolve very well. It took a while for me to dissolve it. I agree with a previous reviewer, all it's going to take is one death, and these will be pulled off the shelf. Thankfully my baby wasn't that statistic last night, but very well could have been."
2,Break Easy,"These biscuits are very healthy, but break very easy. My seven month old only has one tooth, and within two minutes of her chewing on these they break! Major choking hazard! I would NOT recommend these biscuits.I love all of the other Earth's Best products though..."
1,are you kidding me?,"This is only 1.54 in Target, are you kidding me? Twenty some dollars for the teething biscuits, am I buying gold biscuit."
5,Dave S...NPO consultant,"This book hits the spot...a blend of theory and practice that will help you discover what leadership qualities you posess and how to use them to your advantage! What to know the secret of how to ""lead"" from within? Get reading..."
5,Spot-On Leadership Advice for Fundraisers!,"Dr. Wagner does it again!Simply put, she helps fundraisers gain the mindset and skills to become effective leaders. No matter the position a person holds in the fundraising field, he/she can lead! She rebuffs the myths that leadership is about title and authority. She goes further to extol the principles of great leadership by Drucker, Kotter and a host of others. Dr. Wagner really knows the subject matter!Then, through her unique model, she helps the reader understand the difference between managing and leading. She provides practical exercises that help the reader discover his/her talents as a leader. By learning to lead through stewardship or as servants to a cause, every fundraiser who reads this book can instantly gain insights on how to ""lead up."""
4,Transforming for the future...,I have always been a fan of books that encourage the concept of servant leadership (Greenleaf). Serving while you lead is a concept that many other fields do not address. I enjoyed the way the author transformed this to apply to the everyday position that a fundraiser may take with an organization and enhance their ability to make a difference with their leadership in that organization. I also enjoyed the fact that the author gave you others great leaders insights in the area. The extensive bibliography led to more interesting reading for me that I really appreciated. This book helps show how any position can be used to serve and change an environment.
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't let the jacket copy and chapter titles tempt you. Leading Up by Lilya Wagner raises a myriad of questions, but supplies no concrete advice or examples on how mid-level fundraisers may implement leadership. Wagner says the same things over and over largely by quoting other sources. The result is a confusing array of leadership definitions, characteristics, and skills, but zero inspiration and ample frustration.The middle of the book, which promises a new model for leadership, instead gives such elementary information as descriptions of tasks fundraisers must accomplish and titles fundraisers may have. Wagner cites no case studies with answers or examples from fundraisers successfully leading those in higher positions or on their boards. The only transformation this book will produce is in your wallet. If you are a college sophomore majoring in fundraising, this book may be required reading. I'll give you my copy."
5,Best Hot Sauce...Period,"Belizean food consists of the standard Central American fare: rice, beans, and meat. From Costa Rica to Guatemala, one can order this ""comido tipico"" and e assured of what is going to be on their plate. It pretty much tastes the same, although Belizeans have found a way to make theirs taste the best...they have a bottle of Marie Sharp's hot sauce on every table.This carrot based habanero sauce (as well as others in the product line) makes Tabasco taste like vingar and Red Hot taste like a week old chicken wing. In fact, the flavors of this sauce are so subtlely blended that they compliment the taste of the food instead of overpowering it (such as the two aforementioned brands) C'mon, who wants their rice and beans to taste like a week old chicken wing?"
4,Lee and His pals,Lee Ritenour is one of the greatest guitar players I have ever heard. This DVD brings together some of his good friends. The way the friends and Lee are in a circle brings out the best way of playing to each other also brings out the talent.Any person who loves jazz. Will need to have this DVD.
4,Lee Ritenour - Overtime DVD,"If you have any previous footage of Lee Ritenour and the cast of superb musicians that he manages to gather around him, then you will not be disappointed with this latest offering. There are 2 discs, one covering more mainstream material and the second disc which is more in the Jazz-Funk vein and contaions some vocal tracks. The sound quality is good which helps to convey the craftsmanship of Lee's playing and those he has gathered around him. What did put me off a little was the fact that i could not help keep asking myself ""what is going on with his hair!"". Perhaps that is what keeps the magic going on. I bought the DVD and CD as a special offer. I would say that if you buy the DVD you don't really need the C.D and probably vice versa."
3,A Concert for the Band Less the Fans,"Good Music - Lame showThis is a concert for Ritenour's ardent fans only. The music is good, but there really isn't much worth seeing. A CD would provide compareable results.The performance is essentially a concert for the band, not the fan. Great muciscians with a good grove, but little else. It looks as if they crowded into a sound stage, threw in a few cameras and filmed the result. The result: a fine audio performance for a live jam, but fairly disapointing otherwise. Stage presence is non existent.Lee Ritenour - Overtime~m"
3,"This book is ""December 6"" with a different title.","For anyone that is not aware of it, this book is the British Edition of Martin Cruz's last published title ""December 6"", with a different title, assumably altered for some reason to better fit the British marketplace, although I'm sure the fact that many people will get confused and purchase the book twice is not a negative factor to the publisher. So if you have already read ""December 6"", there is no reason to get this book, unless you are a collector who wants the binding variant."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"Despite the previous Reviews, Amazon lists ""Tokyo Station"" and ""December 6th, 1941"" side by the side in the Category ""People who brought.."" as if these were different books. Why do they feel the need for such deceptive advertising? If it hadn't been for the reviews, I would have bought this book myself."
1,Not received,This item was suppost to arrive on Nov.23rd. It still isn't here. It's over a month now since I have ordered it.
1,Inferior quality,"These Hand towels do not match in color the Rattan Martex Egyptian Bath towels or washcloths!!! These hand towels are of inferior weight when compared to the Rattan Martex Egyptian Bath towels or washcloths...All in all, If you want MATCHING Bath Towels, Wash Cloths and Hand Towels, DO NOT order these!!!"
1,Not what's in the picture!!,The quality of this item is terrible it was not what was in the picture or what wat described. Do not buy this item.
1,"bad, bad, bad","The handtowels I ordered in Lemon Yellow came in a very ugly shade of brown. Also, the quality was not good. I returned the order for a full refund. Even though the order error was an amazon problem, i was charged for shipping. All in all a very bad escperience"
2,disappointing purchase,"These towels may be soft but they are not very good quality, and I definitely wouldn't purchase them again. I had only washed these towels once when I noticed that the hem was already unraveling on both towels, exposing an unattractive unfinished edge. Also, I think it's strange that the decorative bands (2 stripes of different textured fabric, same color as the towel) only appear on one edge of the towel. I don't understand why they made them asymmetrical like that. I suspect they sent me a batch of factory seconds."
2,WOW!,"What a CD! This new SClub7 CD offers a menagerie of S Club songs. It includes such hits as Natural, Two in a Million and the new hit, which is currently all over the radio waves, Never Had a Dream Come True. So I encourage all who read this, buy this CD, you will not regret it!"
4,It's Time To Groove With S Club,"This cd is a relatively good follow-up to their first album, ""S Club."" The cd released in America has different songs on it from the one released in England. ""Two in a Million"" was on their first album. ""7"" is missing a great song featuring Tina and Hannah, which I believe is called ""Stand By You."" ""7"" features more than it should, Bradley raps. ""All in Love Is Fair"" is a good song until Bradley raps in the way. ""Natural"" is a beautiful ballad featuring Rachel, who, I believe, also sings ""The Color of Blue,"" which is good. Also good fun are, ""Reach,"" ""Bring the House Down,"" ""Best Friend,"" ""I'll Be There."" All in all, a very good cd that has a lot of fun, dance to songs"
1,The Best Yet,"This cd is by far the best I have ever heard yet. Because it includes two bonous tracks, Lately and Never Had A Dream Come True, it says something. What does it say? That you can decide for your self. Me, personally, I think it gives it an extra oompf, something that it didn't have before. A really great hit song, Never Had A Dream Come True."
4,Rare in the US,"I bought this cd, for the fact of the 3 unreleased tracks, that were not on the Us Version of the cd. Tina and Hannah do amazing on ""Stand By You"" its one of the only songs where you hear Tina's voice anymore! I recommend this cd and Sunshine (And Dont Stop Moving if you want more unreleased tracks) Don't stop moving is a Payback CD to me, it seems that Sclub wanted to show Paul, that he wouldn't stop them, (As in showing him to feel good for leaving the band) the cd has alot of the Sunshine album songs on it, it seems that they wanted to pay him back good."
3,O.K. I Think,"I am a pop fan, but I had trouble getting this one. It's got good reviews by other listeners, but I must wonder why. ""Bring the House Down"" and ""Love Train"" made me laugh out-loud at the stupidity. I would recommend something else, but I don't get any of their music. ""Never Had A Dream Come True"" was good however, rather beautiful."
2,Corniness at it's best . . .,"From the reviews there are obviously a lot of S Club 7 fans out there, and just remember this review is one person's opinion. However I find this CD, well, to put it in a nice way, cheesy. From the 1st track Reach, which is the cliched best friends can do anything type song to the last song, Never Had A Dream Come True, which already has too much airplay on the radio, the album lacks originality. Natural is actually an okay song, as are some others that I can't name off the top of my head. However this will appeal greater to fans of stations such as Radio Disney or TV Channels such as Nickelodeon that listeners to regular mainstream radio and MTV Fans. It no doubt works well for younger kids, but I wouldn't suggest buying it if you are over 12."
5,5 Stars by FARRRRR!,"This is the BEST cd ever!( I don't actually have the cd yet but my friend does and I listen to hers) It rocks my world! I think the best song is Natural. Rach. is no doubt the greatest singer in the world! Natural makes me want to dance. I used to listen to the Natural clip on amazon over and over. All the other songs are awesome too! You should buy this cd right away! If you liked S Club 7 , there's no doubt that you'll like this newer and better version. With amazon's great prices, it's no prob. to get the cd so whata' waiting for?"
5,S Club 7 awesome!!!! buy it today!!!,"'7' is the best album out there. It has different styles of music, from R&B to pop and it also has amazing vocals. The S Club are at their best performance when they recorded this CD and it is a must have for anyone out there who enjoys quality music. Another good thing about this CD is that it has the extra tracks fr more listening pleasure!! Make sure that you go out and buy your copy of the S club 7 album '7' today!!!"
1,Ugh!,"This album would have been good had they included all the same songs as on their import. That one has 4 extra songs on it and it costs about the same. I give this shoddy album 1 star, and the import gets a 5!"
2,Unoriginal. Boring.,"This albulm sounds like it's made up of filler songs, with the single exception of Never Had a Dream Come True. All the others lack any thing that would make S Club 7 stand out from pack, as Britney Spears and Christina Agulara have done by developing a unique style."
1,Unlistenable,"Possibly the worst in a long line of teen pop groups to come down the line is the male/female crew known as S Club 7. On this, their second album, they continue to prove that lack of discernable talent can at least get you a record contract. It's quite telling when the best song on the album('Never Had A Dream Come True')was tacked on to the inital tracklist after the first pressrun. The only other track remotely listenable is 'Natural'--both of the above are available elsewhere, so don't waste your time here--you'd just assume be chewing off one of your limbs than listen to this dreck."
1,OG Style is washed up,"My god, OG Style is well over 30yrs old now and he dropped 2 albums that were so bad that they never made ANY noise. I'd be surprised if anyone actually owned this album. OG Style, it's a good thing you finally gave up trying to rap and realized that you suck. Artists can sell more copies out of their trunk than you did with this."
1,"Predessor model LT2722 turns itself off, can't get support.","I bought a Norcent LT2722 in November of 2006. A few months ago it started turning itself off spontaneously after an hour or two of operation. Now the times have considerably shortened until it sometimes won't stay on at all. Others have reported the same problem on forums. I first tried to get a local repair shop to look at it, but no one has parts or schematics. I e-mailed Norcent support on September 26th and followed up on October 2nd. No reply. I've also had no reply to other inquiries in the past year or so. This problem may be corrected on the newer models, but I'd try contacting their support before buying anything."
3,3.5 stars- On a decline after the mega hit Long Distance Voyager,"This is definitely not in the same league as LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, but that one's definitely hard to beat. The songs that make this album desirable are ""Blue World"", ""Sitting At The Wheel"", and ""Meet Me Halfway"". Not really a bad album though, it just doesn't have the six great songs that LDV did. But everybody's different and some Moody Blues fans might just fall in love with this one. Enjoy!!!"
3,Long Distance Voyager Leftovers,"Okay, as a huge Moody Blues fan, I'll admit this is not one of their strongest albums. The songs on this release, with the exception of the minor hit single ""Sitting At The Wheel"" (which is one of the best rockers the Moodies have ever done) sound like the cuts that were deemed ""not good enough"" to be included in their previous album ""Long Distance Voyager"", which went to #1 on the album chart in 1981. My advice is to first obtain and absorb The Moody Blues ""Magic 7"" albums (Days of Future Passed thru Seventh Sojourn), then bounce back and grab this album so it will be more appreciated. Worthy of 3 1/2 stars."
1,Another dull album,"Every album The Moody Blues has released after ""Long Distance Voyager"" has been fairly worthless. For some reason, I used to like this lame stuff back when I was in high school. As I've grown older and wiser, I have come to realize the error of my ways. ""The Present"" is a thoroughly mediocre album from a bunch of washed up hippie has-beens that barely has enough energy to power your speakers. Stick to classic Moody Blues material instead."
5,IT'S A TRULY BLUE WORLD,"The Moody Blues' career has spanned four decades, their synthesized/symphonic sound has endeared them to millions of fans, myself included. While Justin Hayward and John Lodge's vocal prowess is limited, they write great melodies and imaginative lyrics. Their ability to construct layered vocals and music have made them a definitive band in this esoteric arena.This 1983 release offers their bouncy pop style, their majestic ballads and even a country-tinged cry-in-your-beer song. The opener, BLUE WORLD, is my favorite track, capitalizing on all their best qualities. The raucuous SITTING AT THE WHEEL is a rocking addition. RUNNING WATER is an emotionally charged ballad. IT'S COLD OUTSIDE OF YOUR HEART is the country-tinged effort but a little too noticeable departure for a more cosmopolitan band.THE PRESENT is not an exemplary entry in the band's catalogue, but it's welcome in my collection!"
4,Overlooked Album,"An intermediate quality album by the prolific group, I still think it a necessary addition of supporters of The Moody Blues."
2,Love the story; hate the editting!,"I love Murder She Wrote - the books, the characters, the stories, the TV series - everything about it, I enjoy. But the with the transition of written to e-books, the Murder She Wrote books -all that I bought, not just this one - leaves much to be desired. Someone should have taken the time to go through the final e-book and changed back what scanning did to the story! When words are ""scanned,"" they are sometimes ""mis-scanned"": the letters ""r n"" are sometimes scanned as ""m,"" i.e., ""corner"" becomes ""comer"". This is only one example of the MANY words that the reader has to supply when reading these books, because the publisher of the e-book didn't take the time to edit the final product. It becomes frustrating and diminishes the pleasure of reading the books. In fact, I bought several and read them but got so frustrated I refuse to buy anymore!"
2,Disappointing,"My husband stubbled upon Manhattans & Murder and gave it to me as a gift as I am a huge fan of the TV series and of Angela Landsbury. Manhattans & Murder is written in ""Jessica's"" voice. So I was looking for more books to read and decided to try Martinis and Mayhem based on the customer reviews. I was totally disppointed. Couldn't picture Jessica saying the lines in this book. Plus, it didn't progress the way the other book did - she all of a sudden seemed to solve the case at the end. Not a recommendation from this fan of Murder She Wrote."
3,Christmas gift for grandson,Purchased this toy for a 4 year old grandson who enjoys playing with it fighting dragons and rescuing princesses. So far it has stood up to the rigors of a 4 year old and his three year old sister when she is allowed to play with it.
2,Dollar store quality,"Don't waste your money. Helmet is too small. Sword bent after 5 minutes of play. Poor quality overall, would not buy it again"
3,If they like it then I love it!,"All of a sudden my 3 year old twins want to knights, so bought 2 of these. When they got the item they were excited. They love it. I think the sword is too long for them but they don't care of course. It makes them happy to be able to protect their Queen (me) so that makes me happy and they take that job very seriously. Lol. They learned to identify each part of the knight costume correctly and it seems to be holding up even though it is plastic. Not my favorite item for them but they like it so I love it! Lol."
2,Should have just bought this at the Dollar Store,My child had been asking for this toy set for months. I finally purchased it and was disappointed with the quality of the product. I could have purchased each item at the Dollar Tree around Halloween.
3,"My son loves it, but have super or hot glue handy","My son absolutely loved getting this as a fifth birthday present; it was the highlight of his party. The quality isn't very good, though, and the shield was cracked the next day. I hot glued it together and he still loves it. I've also had to replace the sword twice."
4,Rare Blues Compilation With Two Aileen Stanley Songs,"This is one of Document's best compilations of rare female blues singers of the 1920's. Unfortunately nothing is done to clean up the sound of the old discs, but if you don't mind listening to rare 78s, then that won't be a problem. Of special interest are the two tracks by ""Georgia Gorham,"" who we now know is actually white vaudeville star Aileen Stanley, who recorded for Black Swan Records (a race label) under two pseudonyms--""Mamie Jones"" and ""Georgia Gorham."" A rare example of a white artist ""passing"" for black, but sounding just as authentic."
5,BLast from My Past,My parents use to listen to Mantovani alot when I was younger. I bought this to relax in the car and at home as well as relive my past. The strings of Mantovani sing through recognizable songs from my past ans are very relaxing. If you want to relax and dream through soaring string sections then this is the record for you.
4,Again the Strings Cascade,"Mantovani has become synonymous with ""elevator music."" Aside from the fact that about as many elevators still carry music as they do operators, this is cruel injustice. Arguably more than anyone else, Mantovani perfected a particular kind of ""light classicism"" in the 1950s and early 60s. The arrangements he commissioned were at once lush yet restrained. At the podium he was an exacting taskmaster, and his talented musicians rose to the maestro's challenge. The result, in this CD, is a dozen of his best-known covers--and this is Mantovani, not simply the eponymous orchestra that would later travel under his name.Duke Ellington said that there is, finally, only two kinds of music: good and bad. Of its kind, this is very, very good. If this is ""lounge music,"" then show me the way. I could lounge here for a very long time."
3,Very Classic,If you are strictly in traditional orchestra music- you will like it... maybe because I had different expectations I did not completely enjoy it. Wanted more contemporary sound of great artist.
1,"Painfully dull, cluelessly retro","It's possible that someone out there might still find favor with the over-orchestrated, over-produced music here - the kind that was once commonly used in dentist's offices and elevators to soothe the listener's nerves. These days, while other retro music like Martin Denny can have an agreeably continental flair, Mantovani is just plain dull. This is music of the worst possible type: drained of personality and soul, where even the occasional more modern song (mid sixties) comes off as stilted. This kind of thing has long been replaced by easy-listening jazz; not even the uncoolest of the Star Search generation would be caught dead with this in their closet.This kind of dreck gives you sympathy for the poor listener whose musical background is so impoverished as to make this music an option."
5,common people,"this last season of season seven was good for a season ending. It showed cop are human beings who at times make bad decisions like everyday people then learn from them, sometimes they don't. the show sheds light on the inner workings of being a peace officer I loved the acting by andre braugher who is supreme talent in my view of him. I can't forget the african king yaphet koto playing watch father over his children. the show is great."
2,Jumped The Shark,"Homicide died the moment that Andre Braugher left the show. The slippage was showing during Season 6, but there were still a lot of moments to watch. The addition of Michael Michele was horrible. She's such a lightweight actress, even being too wretched for ER. The Ballard/Falsone romance was pointless, and went against the grain of the show's earlier tone. As for Bayliss's bisexuality--the Big Man would shudder. And what was up with repainting the squad room blue? Or, as Pembleton would remark in the movie finale: ""Cerulian."" Of course, we completists will buy this set, if only to recall how far this show fell from greatness."
4,Season Six and Seven have their great moments...,"While the level of Seasons Six and Seven is not anywhere as consistently good as the earlier seasons, there is much to appreciate. Season Six's episode ""Finnegan's Wake"" is perhaps the best stand-alone episode of the series, and Season Seven offers the taut and moving ""Lines of Fire"" and, of course, the last words of Clark Johnson at the end of the last episode, bringing the series full circle from the first words of the first episode."
2,buckley fans beware,This is a collection of early recordings in no way representative of either his voice or his potential.He sounds super straight very noble in the bard way as if wearing a tie. In no way reflective of maturity of later recordings and I don't mean the far out stuff either.Tim Buckley had a huge spectrum as an artist - sad or wild or space cadet or experimental genius or haunting ballards or brawly bluesmanBut it all takes abit of sifting some albums are better or different collections of his songs than others. This album is more for the disciple who wants a taste of all his incarnations....
3,"Inventing America, Second Edition, Volume 1",The book took along time to get here. The condition was not what I expected. All in all it was ok.
1,Shabby rehash,"This is the so-called sequel to ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", which was a well-written, absorbing story with interesting characters. Far from being a sequel, however, this novel is a sad rehash of the earlier success. Shaw revisits his characters from ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", but they do nothing more than reminisce about plotlines from the original novel. Please be diligent about recycling your post-consumer waste, but don't disappoint yourself by reading a recycled book."
5,i love this album!,wow!!! this is possibly the south at their greatest ever! its their FIRST album a first CLASS album and my first CHOICE album! it features their first single 'song for whoever' plus the fantastic 'sail this ship alone' and 'you keep it all in'....plus many more equally great and strong songs that could all have been singles!!! top stuff! buy it now! oh yeah check out MY FAVOURITE SONG off the album titled 'woman in the wall'
1,"If you like Housemartins, you won't necessarily like this","I enjoyed the Housemartins albums. I tried this album because Housemartins member P.D. Heaton was also a leader of this group. Unfortunately, I found this album (Welcome To The Beautiful South) quite dull. Many other Housemartins fans obviously enjoy this album, so you may, too; however, you should definitely listen to this album before buying it. Musically, it is NOT like the Housemartins."
5,Fabulous,"This disc is a wonderful compilation of very dark songs. The music is extremely listenable and the lyrics, cloaked by the upbeat music, are wonderfully ironic and absurd. My wife loved & listened to ""woman in the wall"" at least a dozen times before she finally realized what the lyrics were about!"
5,"remember the ""housemartins""","this is the band who formed from the ""housemartins"" they are a quirky and yet easy listening group, with both a female and male lead singer who are brilliant"
2,Software does not integrate well,"This is a well made product, but the software is a bit clumsy and does not integrate well. The first set of drivers caused it too crash Microsoft Word. The second drivers worked okay. The software was clumsy. When writing on a document, you could only write on what appeared on your computer screen. You had to then save the writing to the document before you could move down the page. It made it too slow to quickly move through a document in a meeting or other situation. The PDF document writing did not work well at all. After you marked on the screen, you had to save the writing as in Word, but when it saved, it ended up in a different place on the document. It was a significant shift.If you just want to take notes and transfer them to the computer, I would recommend it. But if you want to do on the fly mark up during a meeting or other situation, I think a full tablet PC might be a better choice. That is where I am not looking."
1,Horrible Documentation,"I purchased this tablet because I develop e-learning and I wanted to have the option to include handwritten annotations, examples etc., into my courses. I got as far as installing the software and I could see that the tablet 'recorded' my sample note, but I can't figure out how to get it out of the tablet. The documentation is absolutely horrible and believe me, I should know since I develop training for a living! There are 3 books that you have to surf through to get answers to your questions, which simply aren't there. The product itself seems to be fine, it's just figuring out how to use it... I am disappointed, but will have to return it. No point in keeping it, if I can't get it to work."
1,Not Worth The Time or Effort or Price Tag of $149.00+,"The My Notebook Premium is not well made nor does it have any other redeming qualities. The manuals are very non specific and are not related to the exact product so you have no idea what to download. When you do, the software is not anything to ""write"" home (or anyone else about) - it was not easy to understand - not for me at least. The pen stopped working right away and overall I would trash this entire thing before keeping it. I am returning it tomorrow!"
1,false advertising,"My husband was diagnosed with a cyst on his vocal chord and was unable to speak for 3 weeks. We ordered this product to use during this time. The item with picture was listed at $139 with a 90% discount. When we received the confirmation of order email, the item being shipped to us was a car adapter. My husband forwarded the email to Amazon with a complaint. Amazon credited us the amount we paid, but we never received an apology or digital notepad. Obviously, we were EXTREMELY disappointed!!!"
3,Okay but not very practical.,It dose exactly what the label says. Works fine. The major downside is that it is also a pain in the butt to use. I will say that it works as a excellent input device for pc and it comes with some pretty neat software.
2,I've had better,This is okay but I don't think I'd buy it again. I was looking for a low carb chai and this isn't all that. Plus I was expecting bigger cans and it tasted really watered down no matter how many scoops you added.
2,below average,Flavor is bland needed to nearly double the amount to get it where I liked. Warning as well product has Maltodextrin its the equivalent of sugar for diabetics. Will not buy again may be fine for those who like there Chai with a weaker flavor
5,Our 4 Year Old Loves This Video!,"We have purchased this and all other available MSB videos. This one is one of my child's favourites. It focuses on the human digestive system. He has been watching this video since he was 2 and can tell you all about the digestive tract, villi, and the rest. I highly recommend this video and most in this series."
4,"Errrp! "" 'Scuse Me!""","Well, lots of info on the digestive tract and the answer to the mystical question, ""Is it really bad for you to swallow gum?"" Even a creative ""ending"" to avoid the unpleasant natural ""ending""! Alittle too much story at the beginning for me, but my kids (4 and 8) didn't mind it a bit."
4,Predictable but still liked it,"I have read so many Hannah Howell books that you begin to see they all have the same plot pretty much. They are just so predictable and this one is no exception, but I am a sucker for Beauty and the Beast stories, where the heroine can see beyond the scars and less than handsome features of a man, to see the goodness inside, and love him for that alone. So even though the plot holds no surprises, I gave it a 4 star for that."
3,Not her best,"I love romance novels and read on average about one or two a week. Hannah Howell is one of my favorite authors, and I liked the main characters. Thayer was a nice change from the stero typical romance hero. My disappointment came from the frequent switching POV. Gytha held on to a grudge based on a facial expression, which was weak for any plot. I got the impression that Hannah didn't write it. The ideas were much like hers but the prose was not up to her usual standard. NH"
3,Not to Bad,"The main problem with Hanna's books is the repeating of thoughts the characters have. The Heroine will think a thought about the problems or situations she has, she will then tell the friend almost word for word what her thoughts are and the friend proceeds to parrot it back to the heroin almost word for word. Then the heroine will think over what was just said and say it again. Then she will tell the Hero the Hero parrots it back then he tells his friend who parrots it back to the hero. It goes on most of the book. The themes and characters are good but the parroting of each other's thoughts drives me crazy by the end of the book."
1,Not interesting enough...,"I too found it unbelievable that the main character (a warrior) would be so insecure about his looks. The conversations with his friend about his ""ugliness"" became irritating and redundant. I put it down after a 100 pages. It just was not that interesting. The main characters were basically in ""love"" and in bed by page 50."
2,Had to stop after 200 pages...didn't like it...,"I've only read one other Hannah Howell book and I loved it so I had high hopes for this book but I just didn't care for it at all. I understand the title of this book is Beauty and the Beast but when the hero of the book is so overly obsessed with his ugliness it got pretty annoying. He can't possibly believe that the Heroine could actually like him and want to be with him so he doubts her and really studies her the entire time trying to see in her looks and expressions what the truth truly is. He also stresses over the fact that he just knows without a doubt that she will eventually take other men since she can't possibly be happy with him. It was just so annoying.The 200 pages that I read was so repetitive that I just totally lost interest. After the wedding, they make love, travel, get attacked, make love, travel, get attacked, make love, travel, and on and on. I was getting very bored and finally had to shut the book for good."
5,One of the Must-Read books in philosophy of art,Read it yourself and make up you own mind. Danto is one of the few philosophers with a functional right hemisphere of the brain.
5,Eyewitness to the Indian Wars,Great historical work. Chock full of differing accounts of incidents from the regular foot soldier to the Indians themselves. Every page lends insights to life in the late 19 century and the fate of the American Indians battle against civilization.
4,Good music,"I just got the DVD yesterday and watched it all. The music was great. As others have said he is the master of his domain. The music is great and I was/am excited to see him onstage since he is not coming around these parts on his summer or fall tour this year. However, I guess I could have done with out the pee, fart, and picking nose antics between songs. I don't really know what I expected his personal life to be like but hell, he came off as a dork on the DVD. I wondered if they caught a sober side of him at all, which is a little disturbing thinking that many of the shots were of him and the others behind the wheel of the bus, driving. Anyway... Its well worth it if you want it for the music and stage performance. If your hoping to catch a little peek into his personal life, you'll be a bit disappointed.Jason"
2,Overrated,I've seen Keller live a few times and every one of those shows was better than this DVD. This is a really mediocre show and it does not come close to showing his musical ability. The songs on here get tiresome because the entire DVD is only ONE show. They should have taken songs from different concerts so you could get a better idea of what he can do. Borrow this from a friend but don't buy it.
5,Finally Season #4 is Here!,Facts of Life fans dreams have finally been answered. After a long delay Season 4 is coming out in early May. I can't wait to pick up the adventures of the girls! I hope we won't have to wait so long for Season #5 !!!
4,facts of life season 4 info,"It looks like all episodes including the movie will be uncut, however technically there were only 23 episodes in season 4 if they split the graduation episode up than those two episodes could be syndicated but lets hope they are not!!!!Just got my set the graduation is a one hour block so it is uncut along with all the other episodes!! Hope Shout releases all the other seasons faster than Sony did"
5,Please continue the releases,"Season 4 onwards is when Facts of Life really took off and hit it's stride! After the rather serious 'issue laden' 3rd season, the world is waiting for the fun seasons to begin. Don't forget the George Clooney seasons which I'm sure will do well with his fanbase. Sony, please don't keep us waiting any longer!!!"
5,Bee Gees,I am so glad that I found this cd and was able to purchase it. My older copy was badly scratched and I could no longer listen to it.
4,Their greatest songs on a 2 disk set,I bought this CD a long time ago from one of those CD clubs and at some point in my life lost it or had it stolen. There are so many good songs on it that it just made more sense to purchase the CD then to download the individual tracks digitally. So glad to finally have back in my collection.
5,Nice Compilation,"All the greatest and my personal favorite songs of the Bee Gees is here so what can I ask for, a must for the Bee Gees Loverdon't missed this CD!!!"
2,Time Heals,"Fortunately time does act to heal most wounds, including those of Disco. This music is rarely heard any more unless you inflict it upon yourself."
4,helpful supplemental guide,"Just got this one and I'm finding it really useful. It's not the most comprehensive book on the subject, but what it does have is really well done. Only briefly mention of the Bach flower essences, focusing instead on less well known flowers, mainly from Australia."
4,Stands the test of time,"Almost 30 years down the road this albums still sounds good. As much Rush as Motley Crue, there's some serious music in Vandenberg, despite the glam trappings. It's a shame that Adrian Vandenberg succumbed to the lure of fame and money with Whitesnake."
5,Eighties rock,The strongest album performance wise of their catalogue. Everything is spot on with good melodies.
1,Good music but....,"My bad rating isn't for the music , which rocks - it's for the piss poor mastering ! This sounds WORSE than my old CD's - if you buy this get it for the great music but DON'T buy to get a disc that sounds better than your old ones ."
5,great diaper cover,"These are great! the snaps work forever and dont get all fuzzed up like hook and loop/Velcro. I bought 3 size large for my 15lb baby knowing they would be huge. I wanted them to last me a while as she grew. There is a whole line of snaps so I figured I would just snap the snaps tight, since she was small. It works great! These things are industral strength. I only have the three of them, and rarely use desposable. I wash one each day and have been doing this way for 2 months now. Just throw Bummis in with regular laundry. Very easy very clean A+"
5,If you saw Pilot Candidate it would be your favorie to !!!!,"This series is the BEST!!! I have seen all the episodes shown on adult swim. I taped all of them and watched them over and over, but unfortunatly the tapes were corrupted and now I'm buying the whole series on DVD. The series isn't a copy off of anything, but the only disappointing part is that the series is cut off when it could have and should have gone a lot further."
4,What? That's it?!,"Pilot Candidate managed to tell a weaving tale, which ended very suddenly, it seems.Just as a couple of the candidates you've been following through three DVD's seem on the verge of becoming top candidate, if not, a pilot, the series seems to have ended.Now, some people have accused this series of being an ""Eva clone"". This series actually turned out much more interesting. The characters, for the most part, don't have major neurosis, and the plot doesn't get mired in theologies and mythologies. It flows very evenly, and gets you to ask questions about what you've seen.My only real complaints are that the english voices are very detached, and the subtitles aren't a translation, so much as a transcript of the english dialogue, a lot of which isn't what was said in the Japanese text.Overall, the title is extremely solid and consistent. I just wish there was more!"
3,"Well, I think you people need to be more open minded.","I saw two episodes of this on Cartoon Network and I loved it! It may not be the best, but it was good, and it deserves a chance."
4,Tim Buckley - avant-garde contemporary song writing,"I remember the day I bought this album after listening thousands of time to the Happy/Sad and Blue Afternoon albums. It was a real cultural shock. The Lorca song with its contemporary approach and the exploration Tim Buckley was doing with his voice blew me away. For a young singer in his early twenties, one wouldn't expect such a mature understanding of song writing in avant-garde style as well as in romantic ballads like I Had A Talk With My Woman. Definitely worlds ahead of his time... a timeless musical statement."
5,For more open-minded listeners only...,"IT's one of the most adventurous record of Buckley's. IF you look for ""Tim Buckley"" or ""Happy/sad""'s romantic tinge you may be disappointed, but don't worry, you will soon find that it's replaced by the innovative, atonal yet impressive, stark yet brillant music. Best Cut: Driftin' and Anonymous Proposition. The lyric include romanticized sex, but unlike ""greetings from LA"", it's not as explicit, and are treated with beautiness. Also, Underwood's guitar, excellent. One week moment is the last track ""nobody walkin"", it seems to be suggesting his latter soul adventure (which for many is quite disappointing one)... but overall speaking you should try it, unless you are used to those rubbish pop nowadays. Still, it's a shame that starsailor, reportedly his best, is out of print! Also blue afternoon..."
5,i'd give it six if i could,"so, so stark venture into Tim Buckley's heroin drenched vision. royal trux (even when they were good) wished that they could touch the sentiment that, throughout this recording, Timbo uses to beat you over the head with. this is an immaculate, stunning representation of a very high, very desolate individual who can flat sing. good lord."
2,Still Feeling Uninformed,"I read this book when I was first diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.I was uninformed and confused about my condition,I picked up this book because it had rave reviews.In short,I still feel uninformed and this book confused me more!"
3,borderline at best,"this book is dated (published in 1989 a lot can happen in 20 years), and heavy on annecdotal recollections. for every nugget of useful information/advise, there are two or three examples of borderlines in action. these ""war stories"" do not offer much in the way of advice or coping options. anyone who has been in a relationship with a BPD (marriage/divorce, professional, friendship, etc.) knows the drill. I agree with the reviewer who advises ""don't make this your first BPD book"". the book has value, but I found the helpful parts few and far between. put this fourth on fifth on your reading list."
5,Cover 2 Cover!,Living with a wife who has this issue has been very difficult. We've been married for 24 years. We have four beautiful children...so it is possible. This book helped explain the issues and gave me some new ideas for responding to the next crisis.
2,"Get his latest book ""Sometimes I Act Crazy"" instead!!","I've been researching BPD full time for weeks now, and I've read several books on the subject so far. While this one is spoken of as the canonical book since it was one of the first, it is inferior to Kreisman's latest revision entitled ""Sometimes I Act Crazy"". I Hate You Don't Leave Me suffers from all the problems already mentioned by other reviewers -- outdated information about the treatment, prognosis, and even mechanisms of the disorder, as well as being somewhat dry. The new book includes all the same information, but also describes the narratives of several very different cases of BPD; the new one does a much better job of helping non-BPD's understand the disorder, and of demonstrating the spectrum of behavior that can result because of BPD."
2,if you aren't BP,"This book would be very helpful for those who just want more info about the sickness. It's right on and very informative. However, as I have BP, it made me feel worse than I already did. I hoped to find a way to deal wth this sickness, and it just made me feel crazy and hopeless. I received it on the weekend, and it really messed up my weekend. If you have BP, I wouldn't recommend it, because it's a book about things you already know about yourself, the way you act, etc. It won't make you feel good about yourself or justified."
1,Outdated and Biased...,"Being Borderline and having read many books on the topic, I think I am in a position to say that this book is both outdated and biased. It references the DSM III which still says in it that homosexuality is a mental disorder. I found the book rather offensive. It makes us seem like we are manipulative on purpose. No wonder some therapists are scared to take on a borederline patient. I have been in therapy more than 15 years and am currently in a DBT group. This is the best therapy. Marsha Linehan Ph.D. is a goddess. If you want to find GOOD books on borderline personality disorder, I recommend: Lost in the Mirror, Walking on Eggshells, and anything by Dr. John Gunderson (McLean Hospital in Belmont, MA) and Marsha Linehan.Don't waste your money or time on ""I Hate You, Don't Leave Me."""
1,Stone Age,"On the positive side, this is the first book I'm aware of that delineates the difficulties of having BPD or loving a person who does. However, it is a dinosaur that has outlived its usefulness. There are so many effective therapeutic treatments and useful pharmaceuticals now available to treat BPD. This guide, while it deserves respect as a venerable pioneer in explaining this confusing mood disorder, needs to be put at the bottom of the reading list for anyone interested in obtaining BPD information. It is far too negative and antiquated. It makes it sound as if there is no way out of BPD. But there is."
3,Not Much Hope For Partners Of BPD's,"I agree with the November 30, 1998 reviewer's comments. This was a good overview of what someone with BPD might be going through. Unfortunately, as that reviewer said, you can't fix someone else's problems. As someone who's read all there is on BPD (including SWOE) and who's begged their spouse to seek therapy, I've learned that there is no realistic way to cope with BPD if they won't even admit they have a problem. Sadly, divorce or breaking up might be the only way out unless you are willing to close yourself down emotionally. If you have kids, things are pretty bleak (at least until they are out of the house)."
2,Poorly written,"It seems as though the editor spell-checked this but that was all. Here are some examples of the poor writing:He feel (sic) compelled to self punishThe borderline may often by (sic) the victim of recurrent quasi-accidentsThe doctors could not nothing (sic) to help MargaretGive me a break. Some interesting information, but I could not wait to be done with this book."
4,One of the best books out there on Borderline Personality Disorder,I purchased this book for a friend. She wanted to give it to her Doctor. She was so impressed with this book she wanted everyone to read it. It is very well thought out and easy to understand for the lay person. A must read if have Borderline Personality Disorder or just know someone that does.
2,"i hate you, don't leave me","The book arrived i one week, however it was not in the condition advertised. i would be careful purchasing from this seller. the book though is amazing if you are a borderline patient or a family member of such. it is easy to read for a lay person. i recommend the book highly."
4,I Hate You Don't Leave ME,Great job! I recieve my book very quickly and in good shape. I would strongly recomed this book for any one who has to deal with someone who suffers from boarderline personality dissorder. It's an easy read and oh so true.
4,Helped me understand and let go,"Many years ago I came across this book by accident after a painful and confusing breakup, and it was a Godsend. It helped me to understand what I'd been through and begin to heal, and I came back to it again and again when I needed reassurance that I'd made the right decision. Nine months after our breakup my ex was dx with BPD and his therapist recommended this book to him, although he never read it. I would recommend this book to anyone who is, or has been, in a relationship with someone who has BPD. It can help you make sense of it all and, if need be, let go and move on with your life."
4,"I Hate you, Don't Leave Me","When I first read this book, I had to stop after each chapter..sometimes after each paragraph to cry. At last, there were people who understood and felt what I had been going through my whole life. It was such a relief. The only down side is that the book is a bit dated.After a few weeks, I got up the courage to show the book to my husband and suggest that he read it. After all, I'm the one with BPD. When I showed him the book, he said, ""Oh, our marriage therapist gave me this book to help me understand you better."" My only regret is that I didn't learn about this book sooner."
3,Information in this book is too old,"I agree that this book is well written, but I, as someone with borderline personality disorder, believe that when this book was written, treatment for the disorder was not establised in an organized way. I think this book writes about the disorder as if there is no hope for those who have the disorder. I know that is isn't author's fault. When the book was written, it was probably true that there was nothing to help individuals with the disorder. I admit that this book gives me a good understanding about the disorder, but I am concerned that someone thinks there is no hope if you are diagnosed with the disorder. In terms of treatment and therapy, what the book is telling us is no longer true today. The borderline personality disorder is treatable today."
3,Staple BPD But Difficult To Read,"I Hate You, Don't Leave Me is packed full of useful information if you are a clinician. It is very useful in understanding BPD but falls short in entertaining the reader. I have referred this book to many of my clients, but more times then not the client returns saying they could not finish the book because it was so difficult to read. Unfortunately, there are very few noteworthy books about BPD on the market. The exceptions and what I recommend if you are involved in a BPD relationship (friends, family, significant other) is #1 One Way Ticket To Kansas by Ozzie Tinman, #2 Stop Walking on Eggshells by Randi Kreger."
3,A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO BPD,"I was so confused, wondering what was wrong with me. I was told I wasn't good enough. I went to therapy trying to find out what was wrong with me. My therapist finally told me my wife was manic depressive but I was okay, only angry about being verbally and emotionally abused for years. I still didn't understand. Years later, I discovered an affair, then another and another. As I reviewed our past, I discovered I lived in denial and failed to recognize my wife's manipulations and how she hid her affairs. The discovery was shocking. I was totally confused. I couldn't make any sense out of it. What was going on? This book helped me understand. I became more aware. I was a co-dependent to a BPD. The book helped me cope through the SET principle, but had mixed results with her because Borderlines question empathic words. A great introductory book to become more aware. Learning more about BPD isn't as important as learning to deal with it on a daily basis with loved ones."
5,I hate you don't Leave me,"This book is an excellent and must read for anyone dealing with a person with Borderline Disorder. It is clear and concise and offers an excellent approach to dealing with a person with Borderline Disorder. It is an important book that both persons with the disorder, as well as, loved ones and those closest to the person with the disorder should read. I would highly recommend it."
4,Helped some,I was told I had BPD at a young age but didn't really understand what that meant..Borderline of what I kept asking but still never got a good answer. I came across this book and it was my life summed up. It helped me understand what I was doing and how to deal with it for the most part.The end was a little dry but I felt better just knowing I was not the only person with BPD.
4,Very Informative,This book is very interesting but informative at the same time. Sometimes these disorders are hard to relate to but this author gives a name and a face to BPD. Overall a great book.
1,Don't Read,"There are several problems with this book.1 - Extremely outdated2 - Gives the impression that people with BPD are hopeless3 - Very disocouraging reading for anyone with BPD4 - Kreisman isn't the BPD expert he makes himself out to be, trust me, I've met him before."
5,Intense,Excellent explanation of a familiar behavior pattern and lifestyle causing total chaos and impossibility in relationships. Intense is what you wanted -- right?
1,Chapter 1,"I don't know if this book will be any help to you but it was NOT to me...My wife only read the 1st chapter, ""I HATE YOU..."" and then she stopped...I think she found her answer :)"
5,borderline,"very good book for those just learning about the illness,it iseasy to understand. not a hard book to read. the only problem is there has been more research since back then and I encourage others to read other sources too."
5,Allowing empathy for the hated,"Many people seem to see borderlines as impossible to deal with, hopeless, and beyond comprehension and human emotion. This book gives people the chance to connect emotionally with the pain of borderline personality disorder AND offers hope for change and healing. I recommend it to anyone diagnosed with BPD, close to someone with BPD, or treating someone with BPD."
3,Out of date but should be read,"This book presents the many medical opinions on BPD through the 1970's in an elementary and readable style, but today's therapy and medication improve the outlook presented in this book. Still, the title describes the situation PERFECTLY, and it can be easily read by family and friends (although I wouldn't recommend it to newly diagnosed BPD's), along with ""Stop Walking on Eggshells"" and others, when BPD enters your life. Authors: please bring out a revised edition!"
3,Great book for its time but outdated and needs updating,"Borderline personality disorder has levels of prevalence, social dysfunction, health care utilization, and chronicity that make its public health significance similar to that of other major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression, yet it has not received comparable attention.This was one of the first books offered to the broader public, and as such deserves its place in the BPD literature.Borderline personality disorder often leaves those who become intimately involved feeling guilty, helpless, and like they have personally failed. For an excellent example of this sense captured in a book, read Walker's THE SIREN'S DANCE: MY MARRIAGE TO A BORDERLINE, which also has clinical appendices discussing DBT, etc.Both of these books will give the reader a great understaning of this very complicated and hard to treat condition."
5,Answers at last!,"This book was very informative on BPD. The case studies included were very helpful in helping to understand more clearly. This book is user friendly. I ran through this book very quickly, I had a hard time putting it down. After reading this book I felt so much more informed about BPD which seems to be a mystery to so many."
1,I found this book to be very negative.,I have BPD and did not find this book to be helpful. It was extremely negative. The persons suffering with this disorder were portrayed as manipulative and very difficult. These people caused so much pain and suffering for others. I felt horrible after seeing myself described this way. There is a continium of severity of symptoms. We are not all like the patients portrayed in the book. I was very disturbed by the bleak outlook on the possibility of recovery. My psychiatrist and I discussed the book and my reaction. He said that other patients had similar reactions.
1,truth,"I read this book several years ago and was left with nothing but a feeling of utter despair and hopelesness. Contrary to man's attempt to analyze and proclaim that which he can only rationalize, there is a cure. But we all have the choice --beleive the lie or learn the TRUTH. The theories and lies of this world are many but through just a small step of faith you will see. ""And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."" (John 8:32)."
1,Terrible,"Don't read it; don't get involved with it. It's just another book written by people who don't have the slightest idea what their writing about. Don't be mislead by them, and most of all don't buy this book."
1,A reader from washington state,I have picked it up several times but never copletly fished it because of the difcult content.
2,Outdated and Poorly Written,"I have to give this book props for being one of the early ones out there about BPD. However, now it is extremely outdated and gives the reader just enough information about BPD to make the BPD person suicidal and those that know one to run for the hills.It's also very poorly written with bad grammar and sentence structures that are distracting. Did the proofer give up on the book, too? My copy is from many years ago, so maybe the grammar has been fixed in subsequent runs...at least I hope so. Another thing I hope was updated in reprints are the statistics that would make any statistician cringe...they're that riddled with error.It does have some good information about what might be going on, but there are much better books out there now.Read with caution."
3,An easy to understand overview of BPD,This book is a good introduction to the subject of Borderline Personality Disorders. Much of what is said can be found in the DSM IV. The suggestions as to how to deal with BPD makes this a book more for families and sufferers of BPD. Most other books seem directed towards profesionals
2,untitled,"My therapist lent me this book 3 years ago. Reading it upset me so much I posted it back to her. Its reference to a therapist who momentarily wished his client would just kill herself led me to believe that she wished me dead. Two weeks ago I suggested to her I may have BPD. She concurred and I asked to borrow it again. This time I found parts of it helpful eg descriptions of certain mental experiences which I had always thought of as personal quirks/difficulties. One thing I strongly objected to was the constant use of the label the borderlinewhen referring to people who experience these difficulties .When you have no sense of self it is only too easy to pin your whole identity on a label,without having others do the same.I am ambiguous in my overall view of this book.Although I found parts of it informative and helpful, I was still left in tears at the end of it because of the gloomy outcome it suggestedI wouldnt recommend reading it to anyone feeling vulnerable.Great title though!......"
4,"Good explanation, need more advice though","This book did a good job of explaining BPD. I can imagine many people saying BPB does not exist, that it is just an excuse people give for bad behavior and not taking responsiblity for their own actions. BPD is all too real and it is too bad the therapy community does not address it head-on. If you are involved with someone who has BPD, good luck. You are in for a tough time. Unfortunately, getting out of the relationship is something you will need to consider, as the book rightly says you cannot ""fix"" someone else's problems. I wanted the book to offer more advice on how to deal with someone who has BPD, but I agree with the reviewer who thought that section was too thin. Could be because there is no realistic way to deal with a BPD without shutting yourself down."
2,In need of updating,"I have some borderline traits, and this book came highly recomended to me. I wasn't impressed at all. First, it simply needs updating to include newer medications and treatment options. That was a big thing that I noticed. The other major problem that I had with the book is that it seems much more geared towards people who know someone with BPD and not people who have (or think they may have) BPD. I walked away from the book feeling like I hadn't learned anything useful that could help me understand and work towards overcoming my extreme anger issues. Fortunatley, this is my second BPD book to read, so I did not walk away from it thinking there was no hope. The first book I read was ""Get Me Out of Here"", an autobiographical book from a BPD sufferer, Rachel Reiland. I would definitely recommend her book over this one."
4,Great Book,Outstanding Book.Whas hard to find it for me here in Brasil....Amazon.com is a great Tool:-)Delievert right on time.Thanks
4,Good service,"The book was not in as good of condition as promised. However, when I asked about it, they promptly refunded my money."
3,Struggled to finish.....,This book did not hold my attention--my mind would wander. Put it aside several times but I finished with a struggle.
5,Great Music!,"The DVD is great watching! If anyone is a Fan of either Band, pick this one up! If You are a Fan of any of the Bands on this DVD, AND give it anything less than 5 stars. I don't "" get it"". Sit back enjoy and ,"" Burn One""."
3,Short dvd leaves you wanting just a little more,"This dvd is kind of what I expected in terms of sound and video quality based on when it was recorded. It's less than an hour long and includes 2-3 songs from each band. I have to say that I was a little distracted by the long cuts to dancing girls since you don't really get to see that much of the bands playing. Not a huge deal, just a little frustrating. This dvd is fun to watch if you already love the music, which I do. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this dvd unless you love these bands and want a taste of nostalgia."
4,a treat,"first, i am very impressed with the quality of the recording! to be able to see this historic event is awesome. now the review; first santana;5 stars; incredible performance .. the entire band is way first rate,wow are these guys awesome musicans!!! can't say enough good things.if carlos played like this for 25 yrs. he would be one of the most popular bands ever.!!..next grateful dead; 4 stars;nice, but short set of period standards, but somewhat hard to follow santana and the energy his band put out;; still enjoyable for sure. love the girls dancing on stage.. groovy.. next jefferson airplane; 3 stars; seems to me you can already pick up on the vibe that splintered this band into 2 factions.jack and jorma absolutely smoke everyone else off the stage...man those 2 were amazing. that said the band chemistry is just not that good. they were a powerhouse none the less and thier influence in san fran and then nationally can not be overlooked. summary; a must see !!"
1,Green or great health hazards???,"I bought a 32 oz bottle from local Whole Foods Market. There are no ingredients listed on the product, so I checked Ecover's website. I was totally shocked: how can one claim this is a healthy product when the 2nd ingredient (only next to water) is Sodium Laureth Sulfate and it also contains 2-BROMO-2-NITROPROPANE-1,3-DIOL?If you are not familiar with the above two ingredients, just google them yourself.Here is the list of all ingredients on Ecover's website:Aqua Sodium Laureth Sulfate Lauryl Polyglucose Sodium Chloride Whey Citric Acid Parfum Limonene 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol Calendula Officinalis Extract Chamomilla Recutita Extract"
1,Deceiving product labeling (harmful ingredients),"Like the previous reviews, after buying its laundry and dish detergent, I have found out Ecover products contains 2 potential cancer causing ingredients (Sodium Laureth Sulfate & 2-BROMO-2-NITROPROPANE-1,3-DIOL). The deceiving part is on the product labeling, no where it shows the product contains these 2 harmful ingredients. You will have to read the back fine print and go to its website to read the full product ingredients to find out these 2 bad ingredients."
4,Good book,This book does a great job of showing the entirety of God's plan starting in Genesis and going through the end times.
4,Works as advertisied,Works very well. Allows batteries to be charged outside of the camera. The cigar lighter adapter is handy when away from home.Would make this purchase again.
1,This POS deserves NO stars.,"This is trash. I was looking for a holder for a 9 inch plate--if I stretch it to fit the plate, the prongs bend. Went right into the recycling bin."
1,Too Small,"I have a 9"" display plate that I was trying to hang. When I tried to attach this hanger, it bent. It is supposed to fit 7-10 inches but cannot span a plat at the upper end of this range."
1,Do not purchase,Do not purchase this item. It did not stretch to hold the recommended size plate. It broke when I tried to stretch it.
4,Weird even for Star Wars sci-fi,"Okay so the romance parts are just weird and the whole concept and who the bad guys are and such. Still, call me an addict, whatever, I liked it.I'm looking forward to the next two books. They had better straighten a few things out by the end though.Plot was confusing but interesting. Not the best star wars book I've ever read but a valiant effort and a decent story."
4,an excelent follow up after the New Jedi Order,"When beginning this book i didnt know what to expect after NJO i was a little concerned about how the expanded Universe would be changed. But my worries soon dissapeared, the book stays true to the saga.Ok so it begins with jacen feeling a stong call in the force from an uknown being that is coming from the unkonwn regions.when he arrives he discovers that all the surviving membersfrom the Myrker mission were also called to the place.If i tell any more i will be giving it all away however in the book luke finally begins to unravel the mystery of who his mother was. I would recomend this book to all starwars lovers from 12 and up."
2,the joiner king star wars book1. dark nest.,the job of an author is to make you care about the subject they are written about and to see what what they do to example harms way. well the chiss is just a horrible idea. the only reason why this series makes any sense at all is because its got some info about stuff that happens in the series. like how jacen gets twisted and follows his greatgrandfathers fate. other than that i see no reason this book should have been written . i was horrible bored while reading this book. if the auther wanted to do a story like this should have been a stand alone. not a tie in to another series.
1,Typical,"This book has two bad elements---the tedious Solo babies (Jaina and the insanely dull Jacen), and its author Troy Denning. As bad elements go, these are large. The 'new look' Force, instigated by ""Traitor""'s Matthew Stover (who imagines he is some giant philosopher, when he is merely a sophomoric hack), is not a good sign either. But Lucas has pretty well destroyed his own work before, why should we be surprised?But the times when new Star Wars novels garnered 400 reviews on Amazon are long, long gone."
2,Another Creepy Enemy ??,"I was really looking forward to a new story featuring the ""original gang"" from the first three films but disappointment soon set in when I began to read this latest 3-book series (with a story that as usual could be told in 2 books). Just what Luke, Leia, and Han needed---another creepy enemy breathing down their necks and messing with the children's Jedi minds! This involves a hive-mind of ants---the Vong were a hive-mind of horrors, and there is little difference between them. They want to take over the New Republic's territory and make everyone do their bidding. Yawn. I just reread Timothy Zahn's trilogy (""Heir to the Empire"", etc) and really believe it set a standard for continuation of the adventures of the original characters. So far, this current trio of novels doesn't prove itself worthy to be included in the storyline (or timeline)."
1,blistered my babylove's feet,we took some scissors to thesebought for a special vacation visit to a certain mousehad to remove the whole back sectionlove these as flip-flops
4,Janney Engraaving Guide,"I ordered two books on this subject at the same time. This book was clear and to the point--and very helpful. The other ""Custom Gunstock Carving"" was a big disappointment.The Janney book was better illustrated, better written, and had better sequences of what to do next. Gunstock Carving had a list of suppliers which was extremely helpful especially for us beginners."
5,Excellent character study....,"I've read all of Kienzle's books and would definitely rate this one towards the top of the list. I would agree with the previous review that if someone is expecting a good mystery (ie. The Rosary Murders or Death Wears a Red Hat) they will be greatly disappointed. I would not consider this book a mystery at all but rather an excellent character study of an interesting family. Being Catholic, i also was fascinated with the descriptions of the priesthood and Church pre and post Vatican II (though, someone who is not Catholic might not be interested at all in these passages). The only minor criticism i have is that most of the characters we've come to know in Kienzle's other books were not here (or if they were then only briefly). Im looking forward to his next book!"
3,Not a tangled mystery,"This is a good book, but bogs down in a lot of church teachings. All in all a good quick read."
4,Back In Animaniac!,Love the Animaniacs! Still a little mature for my two year old but I look forward to sharing them with her in the years to come.
5,"Volume 4 in the near future, Please","Animaniacs is really zany, and fun at the same time. Wouldn't it nice if the final volume of Animaniacs came out on DVD? I hope Animaniacs Volume 4, which will be the last of the show, is released on DVD, after the production of Tiny Toon Adventures, and Freakazoid! Warner Bros., please say you have plans of releasing Animaniacs Volume 4 in the near future."
3,Not what I expected,I searched for the Pinky and The Brain cartoon series on DVD when I came across this set of DVD's. I thought I had purchased something else when I received my package. It does have the cartoons inside but it also has everything else. The entire DVD set wasn't what I liked.
3,Good news/bad news!,"Two of Disney's excellent live action adventures are nicely packaged together in this affordable 2-disc set. They are both in the full-screen mode. This works fine for the 1950 ""Treasure Island"". A great version of the Robert Louis Stevenson story starring Robert Newton. Now the bad news: Jules Verne's ""In Search Of The Castaways"" is shown here in full-screen and suffers for the treatment. This would have been much improved if shown in a widescreen version. Shame that Disney doesn't give this entertaining movie with Hayley Mills a proper release. Cmon, Disney! Get with the program."
4,Surprising,"The story was interesting, and the cast and the direction really seemed to be aligned. Even the events that seemed to be over the top initially came back to a believable situation. It has a mix of drama and comedy, with a black comedy approach, that was surprisingly good!"
1,Intermission - so boring,"So boring and contrived yes, yes, yes, boring and contrived, and so tedious, could not make it to the end"
2,No Scenery,"While we knew going into the movie that it didn't ""smack"" of our usual preferred show, we thought we would see some scenery in Ireland. Except for the accents and dated buildings/surroundings, it might as well have been shot on a lot in Hollywood. In fairness, we didn't finish watching the movie. It could have gotten better toward the end."
1,"I hate myself for this, but...","I am open-minded, I swear; I am a critical care nurse, so I am NOT squeamish. But aster the girl got punched in the face, I stopped watching; it was repugnant. And, unless you're a girl who's been sucker-punched in the face and mugged, please don't flame me. Shoes and Miles and all that."
5,If you are a Cillian Murphy Fan...,Then you'll love this quirky Irish Comedy. Cillian plays John an average guy who -with his randy sidekick Oscar- creates his own problems when it comes to love when he tests his girlfriend's loyalty by suggesting they break up. Big mistake! Colm Meaney & Colin Farrell round out the cast with their own facets of dramedy which all come together brilliantly in the end.(About as brilliant as Cillian's bright blue eyes... SIGH!) Anyway it's definitely worth the watch. Enjoy!
4,Hilarious comedy,"I just saw this film....thought it was very very funny. Non Irish people might have difficulty with the Irish accents,not to mention the ""colorful""language. The story is full of surprises and it is great to see the quality of the acting in this terrific cast.......Ireland (and the movies) sure have changed since I lived in that country 40 years ago.....a great advancement"
3,Darkside through the Middle,"This Tarantino-meets-""Full Monty"" and ""Trainspotting"" film slices life through the middle where normal people live, but slices with a dark knife of eroticism, violence, anarchy, and rage. Despite its subjet and approach, it manages to deliver a hopeful ending and relentless comedy that throws light in nearly all the shadows."
2,gritty film about weird nasty people,"This movie was gross. It had profanity in about every sentence . . . American f word profanity. They even doubled the usage in most lines. It was about losers who ran around beating up people stealing robbing and sleeping with one another. Even the ""good"" people were gross . . . . Even when the good people had bad things done to them it was gross. For example one girl was used by a former bf for money. It wasn't that she was just used like a lot of people in teh real world are . . . ""taken for a ride"". . . he did that, tied her up, and defecated on her chest leaving here there for days before she was found. You don't see this scene . . . you hear about it. It was just perverse. It is movies like this and Angela's Ashes that really make Ireland a depressingly sad pit of a place in my mind. And the weird thing is that these movies are about Irish written by the Irish. So I guess from what I get is that most Irish think the same thing about their own country."
2,Intermission - You'll take a lot of them during this movie,"Clever opening with Colin Farrell lulls you into thinking you are about to watch a slam dunk of a movie only it ends there. The talent is wasted in this flick, and that is what disappoints the most. The dialogue and Irish accents for American audiences might be hard to follow, but there are always subtitles for those that get lost. Not much more to say on this one, just not worth the view. I'll stick with Guy Ritchie movies (whose movies are hard hitting and put the viewer in the action)."
4,Who would have thought Black Sabbath could sound so excellent?,"The CD is best when the choices are least expected: ""All Cats are Grey"" (The Cure), ""Planet Caravan"" (Black Sabbath), ""Metal Heart"" (Cat Power), ""P.L.A."" (Robert Wyatt), ""Cousin Jane"" (Troggs) are all fantastic, and fantastically unexpected. I can live without some of the movie-soundtrack selections (esp. Tan Dun) and the foray into kitsch - Minnie Riperton's ""Lovin' You"" (wretched stuff, plus it sounds completely out of place here) - but these compilation albums are always a bit hit-and-miss, for whatever reason, and this one is no exception. By my calculation, there are NINE stellar tracks here, and that's enough for me (for the price I paid). I've downloaded the best tracks onto my IPod, along with some of my favorite moody Air tracks (""Bathroom Girl,"" ""Les Professionnels""), and the results are exceptional LateNight music."
4,Legitimate Review of the Album,"This album is part of a series of late-night mixtapes, called ""Late Night Tales."" This series (similar to other dj-mixtape series) allows artists to come up with a range of songs that express their tastes, stories, inspirations, and identities. Air's version is quite excellent and goes beyond the ordinary mixtape. They really set the mood for a ""late night"" chillout-including a range of artists and genres that blend together smoothly (and surprisingly-see the Cat Power-Minnie Riperton, or Black Sabbath-Nino Rota transitions). Definitely a purchase for the well-versed fan, not the ordinary Air fan. The majority of people who are rating this as low either didn't understand what the Late Night Tales series was, or misread the product description. Do not consider these reviews as legitimate."
1,dissapointed,"Not what i was expecting.What i would like is the Air Late Night Tales initial mix.The one they did first . Check the internet on info...it's a whole other bag of tricks.(original 21 TRACK line up) Air Late Light TALES""Way To Blue"" - Nick Drake""Out Of Time"" - Blur""Run Run Run"" - Phoenix""California Soul"" - Marlena Shaw""Wichita Lineman"" - Glen Campbell""The Old Man's Back Again"" - Scott Walker""Mongoloid"" - Devo""Tattoo"" - The Who""My Autumns Done Come"" - Lee Hazlewood""It's Different For Girls"" - Joe Jackson""My Women, My Guitars"" - Cody ChesnuTT""A Song For You"" - Dusty Springfield""Pusherman"" - Curtis Mayfield""La Ritournelle"" - Sébastien Tellier""Brass Buttons"" - Gram Parsons""P.L.A."" - Robert Wyatt""Cousin Jane"" - The Troggs""Pavane Pour Une Infante Défunte"" - composed by Maurice Ravel, performed by The Cleveland Symphony Orchestra""Perfect Day"" - Lou Reed""Maggot Brain"" (Funkadelic cover) - Air""Spoken Word"" - read by David Shrigley"
1,These songs have nothing to do with the Frech band Air.,"The songs on this ""album"" were not written, recorded, produced or even covered by Air. They have nothing to do with Air. YOU could have made this exact album by getting on to itunes, downloading the same songs, burn them to a disc and put your name on that disc and claiming it as your new album.You've got to be a pretty mindless Air fan to give this album 5 out of 5 stars when anyone in the world could have done exactly what they did."
1,Not worth the money,"The songs on this album are not AIR originals nor played by AIR. Besides, most of them suck!"
2,Unbreathable Air...,"First, let me say what a huge Air fan I am. ""Moon Safari"" and ""Talkie Walkie"" two of my favorite albums. They are truly stunning musical achievements. What happened here?What we have with ""LateNight Tales,"" simply put, is a really bad remix album of sorts, mainly due to bad song selections. They are drab, drudging, uncomfortable and bleak. Some of the songs sound like they belong in a low budget inde film. They are nothing like the Air that I know and have come to love. They could definitely take a look at groups like Thievery Corporation, and take some remixing notes. There are a couple good songs on ""Tales."" ""Le Long De la Riveire Tendre"" is a beautiful soundscape in typical Air fashion, and the first track ""All Cats are Grey"" by the Cure is mysteriously dark and interesting.I bought this record without a prior listen. Air was one of those groups I blindly trusted and bought without doubt. I will no longer be doing that. This record is a huge disappointment."
2,Air to Breathe,"Not impressive at all. Rather disappointing. Nothing compares to what they are capable of doing, I'd rather have their own work."
4,once Paul Oakenfold started mixing their songs they're good,"I bought this CD before I knew how to find any decent electronic music. Now I still like songs 7 to the end, my favorite being ""Stinkin Thinking"". It sounds a bit dated by I really liked it at the time."
3,"If you have Pills, Thrills, and Bellyaches you don't neet it",If you don't have any HM albums this is a good choice. There is not much here that is any good that you can't get on PTBA though. I would get that instead.
4,A Slice of Story Please,"Even if you can't visit the bakeries and restaurants of the Lower East Side (and you should) you can enjoy the ethnic flavors by reading Joyce Mendelsohn's book. Like the best historians, she tells stories of the past from a present-day perspective. New York is a city of remakes, architectural and cultural--Mendelsohn combines both. As a former History teacher, I recommend it for a good read."
5,"Enlighting, inspirational and useful!","Whether you live in New York City and want to understand how to synchronize your life with the city's rhythm, or you are just a visitor eager to taste both the past and the present of one of America's most vibrant neigborhoods-the Lower East Side-this book is an excellent companion."
5,It's Not Your Fault: How Healing Relationships Change Your Brain,"This is a common sense approach to phyisological & phsychological issues suffered by abused people.I really enjoyed the basic needs being met for the patients in the mental & phsycial realms, by the most fundamental way; caring & connecting instead of giving a pill or powder to shut them up or quickly get them on to another program that won't work.Every one on the planet that has ever had or will a have a relationship with anyone should read this; professionals in this field especially!"
3,What about GETTING healing relationships?,"I need a book on that. I was in the mental health system for 20 + years and never had one. And they all missed the point of my real problems. Then when you try to get a doctor like her to have a healing relationship, she does everything under the sun to keep her distance from you while at the same time pretending not to, which is a specific example of a general affliction of so many people in the mental health field which is having an expert ability to lie as well as being a hypocrite when needed (convenience) and then covering it up. Where is the honesty? How many therapists are the same way as people as they are as therapists. And that is a real problem for the whole mental health system."
3,"Be careful, its packaged spring loaded","It's packaged spring loaded, so will jump out at you if not careful. It says so on box but I don't read that first. Seems to do good for shading, but frustrating the spring wire that's made into it will go back when you push canopy back to put in your baby, but snaps back in your face. The material is soft."
3,Doesn't work well with Chicco travel system stroller,I think this product is better for a peg prego or quinny stroller - it really doesn't fit well with my chicco.
3,"Not the best baby item, but couldn't find anything better","Why doesn't it come in bright color???It took me a while to find the best way to attach to the Bugaboo, so we wouldn't have to redo it everytime.Using on daily basis.My little one likes the canopy, but hates the mosquitoes net :))It is not a bad product, but not THE ONE I was looking for."
2,Needs to be bigger,"I have a Chicco Cortina stroller and this shade does not fully cover the stroller. I live in Texas so my little one needs all the protection he can get from the sun and from bugs. Insects can still find their way into the stroller by the foot rest and also through the back of the stroller. Currently, my workaround is spraying a blanket or towel with organic insect repellant and placing it near the ""openings"" where the bugs can get into the stroller.Plus side is the UV protection, however UV can still touch my little one via the netting on the sides.I would not recommend this shade to my friends."
4,Good shade,We are going to disney world next month and we needed something to keep the sun off our 9 month old and to let him nap in stroller. This is the best we could find. I have a graco stroller for my son and this fit just fine. It's a bit of a pain to take the top away so I can put him in and take him out. I wish it came in more colors.
5,Great buy!,"Needed something to keep the sun off of my 8 month old. I live in Alaska, and in the summer the sun is up almost all the time, and it tends to shine at strange angles. This shade is easy to put on, and great to use. I walked for 45 minutes and kept my son in complete shade the whole time!"
4,"NIce shade, versatile and worked great for us","We used this a lot in our first summer with our daughter as she was sensitive to the sun as a lot of new babies are. It allows the air to flow freely through it, versatile and adaptable to most if not all strollers. Later on as our daughter grew bigger, she would play with it too, constantly pulling on it. I would say you will not use it much after your child grows past the 6 month mark."
2,too much work!,"I bought this for my jogging stroller to run and protect my babe from the sun...but when all said and done, it is simply too complicated! Everything has to be tied on, and then you have to untie everything to get your little one out! I wish they would have used velcro, it would have made more sense. I think for walking every once in awhile it would be fine, but for an avid runner who needs something every day, not worth it. I will be spending the extra $$$ and buying the BOB sunshade."
2,Not a good fit for the InStep Safari,"The canopy of the InStep Safari stroller is too wide for this sunshade. It fits well in the visor position, but when used in tent style it leaves small holes on each side and the sun falls directly on my daughter's head and face. It is also very cumbersome to change from visor to tent position and back. It also looks rather cheap for the money you pay. I expected something more sophisticated, fitting and easier to use."
4,I like it but...,"I live in a very sunny/tropical area and walk every day atleast 2 miles. I like the stroller shade, it is great quality and does a great job of blocking the sun. The only thing I don't like is that the straps that are used to secure the shade to the stoller are too short to tie in a tight bow so I have to tie them in a knot to keep it in place. So when it comes time to remove the shade from the stroller it is too hard to un-knot and by that time my baby is throwing a fit waiting to get out of the stroller becasue she's hot and I'm dripping sweat from the heat. Some type of strong velcro closure or atleast longer straps would be nice."
5,Great for sun protection!,"My husband has really sensitive skin so naturally we want to help our newborn son prevent any problems in case he has his dad's complexion! The shade is really easy to use. I usually just use the mesh cover because I imagine it's hot under there! But my baby likes it, it's easy to put on our Graco stroller, and most important, it's the only thing I found that is easy, doesn't look ridiculous, and works! Ingenious invention."
4,Love This,What a great product. This is SUPER protective for both sun and UV. I used this with my newborn so I could enjoy some time outside over the summer. Fit GREAT with my jogging stroller and I can see how it would be really easy to use with my Bugaboo.
4,When a small pebble isn't good enough,"If you want to be really accurate with a slingshot, you need quality ammunition.These are slightly small for my purposes...gives great range, but can be a little difficult to hold, depending on the size of your hands. They're also a bit pricey, at about six cents per shot. Still, I found them to fly straight and true, and to be much, much more accurate than the sort of small pebbles and other things I might normally use in a slingshot.If you're looking to hit a 1"" target at 30 yards, this is what you're going to need."
3,A better substitute,"All 3/8 shot is essentially the same. The gator in my pond hates them. In this order, the vendor substituted Daisy brand shot which comes in a plastic snap-top box. This packaging is far easier and faster to use - it makes a difference when you need to get off that fast shot."
4,Ok,They are not that accurate because of flats sides. But they are still good for hunting squirrel and rabbit. EASY KILL
5,It NEVER Gets Old,"This is one of the BEST hard rock CD's from the early days. I NEVER get tired of listening to this. Each song rocks like there is no tomorrow. These guys gave it all and it really shows on this recording.I've always wished there was more music like this, but I'm also glad that this CD exists. It'll definetly get you through the day!!! This CD is definetly hard rock heaven!!!"
4,"Salvaje, demoledor, agotador...","Arrasadora y vigorosa expresión musical que arremete con furia, de una virulencia inusual para la época. Mensajes movilizadores y revolucionarios en sus letras, cuando todavía el rock no había sido domesticado ni vendido al mejor postor. Hoy, casi cuarenta y dos años después, ""KICK OUT THE JAMS"" sigue sonando peligroso...Más allá del sonido sucio y poderoso de la grabación original en vivo, la calidad sonora del CD es un tanto inferior a la del compilado ""Big Bang: Best of the Mc5"", que fue remasterizado."
3,"MC5,huh?",I never got the MC5.I always thought the Stooges were better.But it is still a revolutionary album.AND I do suppose a must have.
3,Disappointed,"I heard the song Kick Out the Jams a while ago and, being interested in punk rock, I wanted to hear that band that helped bridge the gap between the classic rock of the early 70's and the punk revolution of the late 70's.Unfortunately, this album feels more like a heavy version of classic rock than an early version of punk rock. Upon my first listen, I was thinking ""The Doors"" more than I was thinking ""The Ramones."" Eight minute jam songs and extensive guitar solos don't help the sound very much. Kick Out the Jams still hits all the right notes, but not much else does.It's an interesting album from a historical perspective, but it's not going to see a lot of play."
4,Perfect wig,"Bought this for a Luna Lovegood costume. It fit the bill perfectly. It tangled quickly - even in a ponytail. But it stayed together and for the price, it was perfect!"
4,My girlfriend liked it?,"Purchased this for my girlfriend so she could make her Khalisi outfit for one of the comicons in Dallas. It turned out pretty well, so I guess the wig is good?"
2,"Too thin, too long",I returned this item because it was just too thin on the head piece and my dark hair showed through. It was also way too long and the ends were getting frizzy just by pulling it out of the package and trying it on. I got another wig that worked out much better.
4,fun!,"Bought this for a halloween party-- lots of hair. Color is a very bright blonde as pictured.Be forewarned, runs small."
4,Classic English Blues CD,"This is a classic release which contains peak career performances by all. Recorded when these youngsters had lots of fire and talent. Sure they sound young and out of place compared to the work of bluesmasters two and three times their age but so what, somehow they pull it off. As someone else mentioned, the only thing that dosen't make this a FIVE star CD is Mayall's lame contributions in 'What'd I Say' and 'It Ain't Right'."
5,Definitive Version,"This remastered release features both mono and stereo versions of each cut, and the differences are astounding. Eric Clapton did some his most inspired playing with John Mayall."
5,If you like this check these out...,"It's great... a classic.But, if you want some more... then check out: John Mayall (particularly ""London Blues 1964 - 1969"" and ""The Turning Point""), Gary Moore's ""Blues For Greeny"", Fleetwood Mac's early work (particularly ""The Pious Bird Of Good Omen"" - UK only) and Keef Hartley's ""Halfbreed""."
3,"A great place to hear the young Clapton, but with real flaws","Clapton was only about 21 or so when he made this recording. The youngster got the typical support from Mayall, who, then and now, had a keen ear for talent on the rise and was willing to give that talent space in his band. Slowhand plays well on this raw and unrefined recording, but the work here is more of a look back to his influences than it is a definition of what Clapton was destined to become.I've docked this CD one star for the atrocious cover of ""What'd I Say."" Not only doesn't it improve on the Ray Charles original (it would be nearly impossible to do that anyway), but drummer Hughie Flint should have been jailed for his ham-handed playing. This is the WORST drum solo ever put down on tape by a major artist."
5,Best pot cleaner,Both my mother and myself have experienced this product and think it does the best possible job and will continue to use it as long as it is available. Thanks for making it Kuhn Rikon
4,"Catchy, infectious, Velvety, thinking-person's rock.","This is the type of album that grows on you with repeated listenings. I liked it initially, put it back in the rack, picked it out a few months later, and didn't put it back in the rack for a long time. The melodies grow on you, as do the quirky lyrics. The vocals are also an acquired taste that, like a fine wine, get more palatable with time until they are one of the sweetest delights you've had the pleasure to imbibe. Standout tracks include ""Smile,"" ""I Can't Wait,"" and ""We're Both Confused."" A fine addition to any music lover's collection."
3,I love Luna,"I have seen Luna several times in concert, and they're a great band. Particularly if one is feeling mopey, resentful or disconnected from oneself. Hey, everyone needs that kind of thing once in a while. The lyrics from Lunapark in particular are just spectacular-- just from ""Slide,"" we have ""You could never give/The finger to the blind"" and other great little quasi-zen one liners. Definitely pick this one up if you like their newer songs like ""IHOP."""
4,use regularly,I use the product regularly for energy and for heart health. No side effectsthat I am aware of.
4,7 Faces of Dr. Lao,This movie is a blast. It goes to show you just what Tony Randell can do with a movie. I watched it years ago and have never been able to get tired of it. Decided to purchase it so I wouldn't be left to the mercy of TV and when they'd play it again and when and where is just about impossible to find. Definately a must see.
5,Can't beat Tony Randall,"One of my favorite childhood memories. Given the time of the movie, ethnic issues arise, but I believe Mr. Randall deals with this favorably."
4,Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,Tony Randall dose a great job of playing the 7 faces of Dr. Lao. Interesting story line. Great make-up and special effects.
4,Its a classic,"I have seen this movie on tv when I was a kid and loved it. I got a copy for my sister, my mom and myself. The effects are very good considering the year it was made. It also has a very good story."
2,7 faces too many,"If you enjoyed the original novel The Circus of Dr. Lao, you probably won't enjoy The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. And if you didn't enjoy the novel, you probably won't like The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. There is some great make-up in the old theatrical tradition, and the special features has a short documentary on the creation of make-up from the period of the film. However, this probably isn't worth owning the whole movie. Part of the problem is that the novel is a little transgressive, while the film transmits none of this quality. E.g., in the scene where the satyr seduces the school marm, the book is visceral, physical, and erotic, whereas the film is timid, clueless, and uncomfortable. This film could stand a re-make today, but they would ruin it with overdone CGI."
3,seven faces of Dr. loa,"It was a great story, could be done much better now with the special effects..I've already watched three times."
1,Piece of junk,"This VHS tape was not worth a plug nickle. My VCR is in working order, but as soon as I put this tape in it it got ate. Wasn't worth the money I spent on it. Live and learn."
5,A CLASSIC GEM THAT YOU'VE GOT TO SEE,"This little sleeper is a gem that you've got to experience. Doesn't matter if you're a child or an adult, it's an imaginative, humorous and as enlightening experience you'll want to share with everyone. Tony Randall was born to play the role of Dr. Lao (and his six cohorts). Thoughtful and provoking to watch with an open mind."
4,my friend says this is a great movie,"I bought this title because it was cheaper on vhs than dvd. My closest friend loves this movie. At first the vhs tape stopped alittle into the beginning of the movie, He still is going to puirchase the movie when it is cheaper, on dvd. Right now the price is SO high. but then I told him he had to bang the tape cartridge onto a countertop, and flip it over and do the same on the other side. That this would LOOSEN the tightness of the tape. IT WORKED!!!He enjoyed watching the movie that day."
4,Randall is great!,"I had seen this many times when my kids were young, and we loved it. Sure, it's corny and over the top sometimes, but it's thoroughly entertaining. Having read the book, I find they did a good job of conveying its flavor. A classic!"
3,thoughtful,Tony Randell was always good in any work he did. This movie asks the same age old questions in a off beat way. Would you share the very goodness of your soul with others and make life so much more nicer or would you sell out for a few dollars?
5,seven faces of Dr lao,"I saw this film when i was a little girl and it blew me away,and understanding that there was a cause and effect value to the film,Also that you have to look inside, was pretty insightful for a child to grasp...butI caught the end of it just recently and now i have discided it is my all time favorite..."
4,Possibly One of the Strangest Movies Ever Made,"The comment in the title above is not meant to be detrimental to this fine, if offbeat, movie. ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,"" with excellent stop-motion animation from Harryhausen, is an unusual blend of Eastern mysticism (Hollywood-style), Old West myth, psuedo-Freudian psychology, Old World fantasy, and 60's film storytelling. With a great Tony Randall performance, the sight of a pre-Jeannie Barbara Eden, and a most unique transformation from fish to reptile, the movie is a lot of fun. Not just for kiddies, ""Lao"" may not be a classic, but it is one that still holds up after all these years."
2,not very good,"I have other punk-o-rama CD's and they aren't half bad. I thought this CD might be good, so i bought it. well, it pretty much sucks. i don't know how to describe it. Punk music always makes my legs shake or makes me antsy, but this just makes me sit there. it is a pretty boring CD and a let down."
3,decent cd 4 punk fans,i think punk rock is awesome. this cd has a few good punk songs but u could listen 2 a lot of it buy it u wont regret it but it is not as good as the first 5
1,Punk???,"Calling this punk is wrong. If you call it punk, it gets 1/2 a star. The Punk-o-Rama series has been degrading over the years. This is lame pop. It has just gotten worse. P-o-R 5 was awful. I strongly recommend against this album if you are looking for a punk compilation. Epitaph has some good bands, but the compilations are going downhill. I'd recommend comps from Fat Wreck, Asian Man, Hopeless, Tooth & Nail, and others."
2,A good POP compilation,"If you're looking for punk, don't buy this album, but if you call that stuff on mtv punk, go for it. This is just pop. It will appeal to you Blink-182 fans that never knew the band until they were on MTV. Some of these bands are good, such as NOFX, Millencollin, Bad Religion, etc... but the punk-o-rama series has just been degrading over the years. I suggest going with the Fat Music comp line, although lately they have begun to dissappoint me as well."
1,Rich White Boy (puke) not PUNK,Quite calling this PUNK. This is nothing more that RICH SNOTNOSED WHITE KIDS.
5,Sturdy pole,Excellent construction. Matches color and fits Architectural mailbox. Set in sufficient concrete I feel confident this post will last for a long time.
1,Wackiki Wabbit,"Buyer beware! The episode listing is very wrong; it lists titles that aren't there & doesn't list some titles that are there. With the exception of Bugs Bunny, it's a weak collection of animation. I only paid a dollar, though, so I got what I deserved."
5,bookcritic,"This book is beautifully illustrated and presented. Intended for my 4-yr-old, even my 2-yr-old now knows the names of most of the planets and understands their orientation. I would recommend this book to any and every parent."
4,Rickie,"Always love her music; met a long time ago with a mutual best friend; and her brother; all good people, and very artistic."
5,A Haunting Seduction.....,"Rickie was in 1979, and is still today in 2005, my favorite female singer. While critics compared her to Joni Mitchell and Laura Nyro, Rickie was in a class all by herself. No one has ever come close to imitating her style- lyrically or musically. Listening to this wonderful masterpiece on cd is like being given a gift from Rickie herself. Play this cd late at night with the lights out and you'd swear this artist is singing directly to you, for you. Every composition is that personal. Every song on this cd is my favorite, so I can't recommend listening to one over the other. Just trust me, you need this in your collection of must-haves. She is that good. P.S. Thank God ""Girl At Her Volcano"", her third LP, is now finally on cd!! I've completely worn out the original 10"" vinyl LP and cassette."
4,Takes me to another place and time...,"Music has always conjured up vivid images for me. In my opinion, Rickie Lee Jones is possibly one of the most evocative composers of our time. Like one of the other reviewers said, she takes you to Philly hanging out on the stoop. Pretty amazing feat since I grew up in the Midwest with a totally different background.""Woody and Dutch"" is unhesitatingly my favorite of the songs on this CD and any other RLJ recording. Her use of taps as percussion with the scat-style singing is great.Also enjoy ""PIrates"" and ""We belong Together."""
5,How it was meant to sound,"I can't speak about the SACD portion of the Mobile Fidelity Pirates, but the regular CD is my dream come true about how this album is meant to sound. Pirateshas soft lows and then thunderous drums and back again, and these low-high transitions I remember so well from the LP were not handled well on the original CD. On this release everything sounds just right to me. The softer parts weave their spell, the drums have impact again, the piano sounds wonderful, the bass on Woody And Dutch throbs just perfectly, RLJ's enchanting voice is captured wonderfully. As for the album itself, I consider it Rickie Lee's Astral Weeks or What's Going On - a mystical powerful unconventional song cycle where the songs and the playing fell into place just perfectly and could not be repeated again. All 3 of equally worth it for more expensive better sounding editions."
3,Cute movie,"This is a cute movie but definitely not an a-lister. Acting could be better but my son, who loves elephants, liked it. He doesn't pick it first but has watched it more then once. I would not pay full price for it."
4,Great Book,Awesome book for an inside look into youth culture. Parents and youth workers should read this book.
1,A Waste Of Money,"This product should never be offered on Amazon. The visuals speed by at double time with no narration, no music, no sound whatsoever. Only rapid movement, and the music portion is so broken up and scratchy as to be unwatchable."
5,loved it!,"Amanda Bell Brown, the spunky Girl Columbo, is back, and this story about Bell and her man Jazz , faith, and love is even better than the first book in the series. Death, Deceit, & Some Smooth Jazz is the funniest crime novel I've read, and I laughed even in situations that were deadly serious because of Bell's quirky personality and her outlook on her circumstances. Burney's honest, raw depiction of maintaining faith in the midst of great personal struggles is encouraging. She isn't afraid to address issues that most Christian novels avoid, and her voice is much appreciated."
3,Pay Attention,"Just wanted to make note that the Text to Speech feature for the kindle is disabled, so if your visually disabled or just like to have the book read to you, find someone who can read it to you."
3,"Okay, but not excellent","This book is a good source for any Re2 novice, but there are a lot of flaws that turned me away from it. For example, there are several places that lack information, which end up leading the player into a dead end. And don't bother looking for the secret codes... there are none."
1,Unnecessarily Complicated,"This is not a soap box, so I'll try to get to the point quickly. I get that there are hidden agendas and meanings behind poetry, children's movies, and I guess even children's literature. There are biases from the author that kids will subconsciously pick up on. But this book was unnecessarily complicated. I literally could not understand the messages trying to be conveyed from any of the chapters. I can somewhat understand the hidden meanings behind children's literature if I care to read it for more than the surface story, but I could not understand this book trying to help me understand children's literature. Too much academic jargon and not enough getting to the point (something children's literature is good at!)"
1,Incredible,This one should be the first work from a bad movie?s student.It?s a very good exemple about you can?t do. Probably one of the worst things I have bought ever. Don?t follow me. Don?t waist you time and money.
2,weakest link,Of the series of Pose Files this volume is the weakest. That is unless the artist is looking for static and mime poses with the series' least physically interesting models. This is the only pose file in the first nine volumes to include male models in largely disappointing para-martial poses. A model from Pose File 4 figures in several sitting poses using a white box. These constitute the most useful elements of the volume. Pose Files 2 & 3 offer more artistically interesting static poses.
2,"Volume 1 was scratchy, volume 2 is worse","Great old time gospel but this volume is only for the hardcore collector. Many songs are unintelligible because of the quality, or lack of it, of the recordings. I wouldn't buy it knowing what I now know."
1,Quality of CD,Ordered the NEW CD and was very disappointed with the quality. It's very scratchy - like listening to 'Old Scratchy Records'.
3,Not for limbs,Called kolpin regarding their rake attachment and asked how it would work for limbs on a pecan farm and they thought it would work well. My concerns of getting over the top of the limb to grab came true. Probably will work well for feed plots and leveling.
1,Fine writer gets trapped in bad plan,"Theroux's interesting but illstarred plan was to meet the English by travelling around the coast, on foot and by train. Real English, real conversations. He was twenty years too late. About a month into this disaster it's becoming obvious that even the lower middle class have abandoned the gray, chilly English coastal towns for cheap jumbo jets to sunny climes. The old resorts have become God's Waiting Room and battlegrounds for the skinhead urban poor. Chapters go by without him seeing a child, or a real family, only potty old people who hate foreigners. These aren't ""the English."" Poor Theroux. Read his fine book on China instead."
1,depressing writer,"i had given up on this writer years ago as one of the most bad tempered, crotchety, and ill-advised that i had ever read, but when this popped up at my library as an ebook i figured i would give it a try. my first impression stands. i have never been to the UK; i might yet. i won't be reading Theroux again, though. why on earth such a cantankerous man decided on travel at all, much less travel writing, continues to elude me."
2,Less than what I wanted,"I ordered this book inorder to be better informed about traveling to the southwest coast of England this year...It was seemingly a personal journal of someone who was traveling via train along the coast. The reading experience was that the writer was very negative and critical of the people and places visted.....It wasn't very informative about the scenery, people or towns visited......Very disappointing to my desire for information."
2,A Kingdom Not Entered.,"I found ""The Kingdom by the Sea"", read by William Hootkins, snooty and offensive. Its picture of the British is projected right out of the jerkish Theroux's psyche, and does not represent the way one sees a country if one wishes to UNDERSTAND it, which is to see it as it is through the frame of mind of the inhabitants, and with transcendent human sympathy and a great deal of imagination. One goes to another country, first of all, to learn something about ONESELF.Britain is a country to love, not to hate. Having lived there a year, in 1977-8, it still has my heart, and my embarrassed admiration as an American.This is the second Theroux audiobook I have found a failure, the first being his book on Latin America.- Patrick Gunkel (Woods Hole, Massachusetts)"
3,Pinky and the Brain Fan,"DVD set came in quick and I really enjoy this product... My only issue is that I happened to go through Big Lots and found this DVD series for sale for $5. So I lost some money if I waited, but my son loves these guys, and so do I."
5,"Gee Brain, but where will we find rubber pants in our size?",This is more P&B than anyone should do at one sitting.! Narf!! I had to stay up three nights to do it.
4,Flip Flap Shoulder Pads,"Would have given five stars, but the shoulder pads keep slipping out from under the bra strap."
3,"Fun, and for fun only","It is a interesting book to read. But only for fun, can not be treated as ""real science"" book, since he did not present any real evidence (either exoperimental or statistical)to support his conclusion. But, it is always fun to understand such a great scientist's opinion on Creativity."
4,Memories of Old Habana,"Very lovely CD of mostly the Buena Vista Social Club people in a more mellow mood.It transports me to a nightclub before the revolution. There are some new tunes, my favorite is Manolito"" Locos por mi Habana"".I would have preferred more of the newer songs, by the popular artists of today, and less of the BVSC. I have several records by those artists."
5,great story for kids,"Betsy is back in an all new adventure. This time she is off to second grade. She and her best friend Billy are always up to something. This time they fight over who will lose their first tooth first, make great Halloween costumes, and make a big mess in the kitchen when making a snack.You just never know where the book will take you next!The chapters are short and easy to read. There is no violence of any kind in the book. Readers who need gentle book will enjoy this very much.I would recommend this book to kids in second grade. They will be able to relate to the book and the characters in the book well."
3,A field-and-travel tripod that travels well in the field,"I bought this product recently in order to tape a few of my childrens' soccer games. I found that it's light weight was usefull, but the supposedly easy length adjustment was not as advertised. I found that the product was difficult to use in this way and caused way too much shaking for my vid cam. I also had problems with the rubber leg mounts that seemed to ""scuff"" the tiles at home. But I did like the the solidity of the product when correctly positioned. I would suggest you search elsewhere unless the price comes down from $89.95"
4,'Twould be a four-&-a-half...,"I picked this up on a lark, having heard nothing priorly from these Gainesville stalwarts, & knowing only that until a member of Chicago's Tom Sawyer corrected me (when I commented on his Hot Water Music hooded sweatshirt at a show his & a friend's band played & that I organized) I thought HWM was a hippie-jam-band deal since the name reminded me of the 60s band Hot Tuna. But from the word go, the insistence of ""A Flight & a Crash"" hit me. & though I can't always pick up the lyrics --- I know I should be able to since they're supposed be important for a band like this --- I come away from any listen to this record reinvigorated, my creative juices as an aspiring, perspiring hack (writer) replenished. Oh, & bonus points for the band's presumably unironic crib from Bush's ""Everything Zen"" for the last cut."
5,IF YOU WANT TO PASS BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought a few Review books for the NCLEX-PN, and this is the best. BUY it and you will pass!!! It comes with a CD with over 3000 question exactly like the test."
5,Good review book,"Saunder's is a good book to review for the nclex pn. However, for me, I found it to be TMI(to much information). The study questions were easy questions that you could clearly see what the answers were BUT I liked the way it explain it in the rationales. I mostly studied from Mosby's. I pass my test on the first and I am now a LPN!"
5,Excellent review book,I used notes from [...]and used Saunder's Book. I HIGHLY recommend this book. I passed my boards 85 questions this past Feb 6th first try!
5,Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX-PN Examination,the book is good. but the shipment is bad. (my first shipment was lost in the mail. I got my second shipment almost a month late.
5,Saunders Comprehensive review for the NCLEX-PN exam,Book received in a timely manner and in good condition. I am impressed with my Amazon.com purchases.
4,an essential tool for the lpn student,"I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE A GREAT HELP TO ME AND MY STUDY GROUP. I EVEN USED THE BOOK TO PREPARE FOR MY FINAL EXAM AND FOUND IT TO BE AN ESSENTIAL TOOL WHICH HELPED ME A GREAT DEAL. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE SEEN OUT THERE IN REGARDS TO NCLEX BOOKS. THE DISK THAT COMES WITH THE BOOK IS ALSO GREAT, WITH 3000 QUESTIONS THAT HELP YOU PREPARE FOR THE BOARDS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL LPN STUDENTS ITS WORTH GETTING YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE WITH A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE."
4,Good Book Bad CD,"This is a good book, good informational sections like ""Care of client with a tube"" Book is outline form, with ""pyramid points"" that the publishers think are the crucial elements to understand. I would buuy this book again if I had to go through nursing school again, BUT! the CD crashes on me everytime I try to complete a long comprehensive exam, WHICH IS VERY FRUSTRATING! And my faulty CD isnt an isolated incident, a few other students have had the same problem. The Book gets 4 stars the CD gets 1 star because it crashes. If you want to pass your board buy this book, buy Mosby's Book by Mary O. Eyles, use both CDs, take a month off work, study full time and youre almost guaranteed to pass the NCLEX. BTW the Mosby's Book and CD are better than this book (ie no crashes) but this book has some good info the Mosby's doesnt. If you can buy only one book, buy the Mosby's."
5,"Saunders Comprehensive Review for trhe NCLEX-PN Examination,Edition 3",We ordered this book to help our daughter study for her NCLEX exam. It was very helpful and we are happy to say that she passed the test and is now a Licensed Practical Nurse.
5,BEST NCLEX-PN REVIEW BOOK! STILL USING IT!,"I had several different NCLEX study books but this is the one that I used most. It is my LPN BIBLE STILL! I also had the Saunders Q & A, which I liked, but this one is so well organized. I still carry it in my nursing bag for reference. This book was recommended to me by one of my clinical instructors and I'm glad I bought it. I passed NCLEX-PN with 85 questions in Jan 2008. My cd worked pretty well. I did 3000-4000 questions before testing which is recommended. I will be using it again to study for an RN Bridge program. I wish I would have used it more during LPN school."
3,Didnt do it for me.,"I brought the first album because I loved ""Lovin YOu for Life"" and I enjoyed about 5 other songs on that cd. And I brought this one only on the strength of the first one and it just didnt do it for me.Don't want to say anything bad but it all sound so familiar."
3,Good but not Great,"When i heard Methrone's single ""double play"", i was mesmorized by it.It is still one of my favorite songs to dis day. But when i got tha cd, i was a little disappointed. The cd is decent, but not nearly as good as i thought it would be."
5,great even when u r 10!,my aunt got this 4 me 4 christmas(she just bought this becuse i like starwars)and i thought oh crud i opend up the box and supriseingly it was one of my faivorate presants it is coool but the engine sound bites and the obi-wan vvoice tht says use the force or etc.and th lasers are great they fall off all the ime so i hot glued mine on and it worked it comes with luke and r2!
2,"Beautiful plates, bad translation","Reading this book is really a chore. The phrasing is disjointed and flies off on fanciful tangents and metaphors that sound awkward and serve only to confuse the reader. I attribute this to the translation, though some of the original scholarship may be faulty. The real reason for owning this book (and I bought it with full knowledge of its flaws) is its fabulously beautiful color plates. They are stunning, almost all full-page-- the best Cranach plates that I have seen anywhere. There are some interesting outlines comparing the development of Cranach's work with the development of Western Art in general in the back as well. Some of the opinions are interesting, though not ground-breakingly so, if you can manage to wade through the excessive language."
4,Excellent colour plates; lousy choice of typeface.,"Cranach was an extraordinary painter whose work deserves a beautiful book. This would be that book, if it hadn't been set in a horrible type which makes it very difficult to read. The flowery style of Mr. Stepanov seems to have been somewhat clumsily translated, with some long-winded phrasing. The plates are absolutely beautiful, which makes the book a bargain. I feel thoroughly satisfied, even with these small complaints."
5,Dilla's Donuts,"""The only drawback is that ""Donuts"" on a whole carries the stamp of something manufactured or, like the scarecrow in Oz, lacking a heart""As I was reading that I was wondering if you even listened to the cd? Donuts is anything but manufactured, amazing beats like this CAN'T be manufactured. This cd is a classic, 31 tracks of the dopest beats you will ever hear from the most under appreciated producer/rapper of all time. Don't waste your time reading reviews on this cd, just buy it!R.I.P Dilla Dog"
3,OK BUT NOT GREAT,"THIS WAS AN OK ALBUM, GREAT PRODUCTION BUT THE ONLY GRIPE I HAVE IS THERE ISN'T A SINGLE SONG ON HERE THATS LONGER THAN 2 MINUTES, RIDICULOUS"
3,For beat heads,"This album was good. I would have liked if there were full length instrumentals on here but whatever. Some of the beats on here are pretty dope, Some of the best ones are the shortest. If you are looking to complete your Dilla collection or just love beats then get it."
4,Man what a shame,Man what A Shame to here that Jay Dee died of the Lukemia virus I believe it was. The guy just turned 32 on 2/7 and Died on my 21'st Birthday. He had a great thing on the Hip Hop circle and I even saw some videos he produced on MTV and BET. Instead of playing the crappy artist such as D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz they got to play some of his stuff. Man we will never forget you all the true Hip Hop Believers. As for the music it is a Instrumental album an is pretty good it is not the greatest beats he ever produced but it is sure to sell pretty good as it should because he died of a terrible Dissease and he was a very talented producer to. Rest in Peace J-Dilla
3,RIP: this is a Pretty Good Album,"J Dilla was a Good Producer who had a hand in creating a Sound within Hip-Hop that alot of folks truly appreciated. the Brother died way too young,but has left a Lastign Musical Inpression on so many folks.He had his own Signature&beats."
3,RIP DILLA,this album may not be that great..but theres no doubt dilla influenced thousands. His production has inspired producers everywhere. RIP DILLA
5,Disney is the best for great family fun.,"There is nothing as good as a Disney movie on the weekend with your family. The Shaggy Dog and the Shaggy D.A. have been favorites of mine for years and now that I own them, I watch them over and over again."
5,The Shaggy D.A./The Shaggy Dog (Combo Pack),"Excellent! Just as I remembered them! (And NOT CD (OR DVD -R) ""Made on Demand"" copies, but rather Studio releases.) Shipping was quick, merchandise arrived well-packaged and in good condition."
5,It's just cool...,"Because of them, I made a trip from Far East to Europe. They're the best. And you have to hear them by yourselves."
1,A waste of money,"I had to listen to this by myself. I wouldn't want to subject this ""music"" to others. It's not that I'm new to ""noise/fuzz"" pop. I own and enjoy many CDs by Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr., but this band just lacks the ability to put together listenable tunes. I had to sell this sorry collection of ""tunes"" after 3 or 4 listens. I gave it a chance but each time I listened to it, I lost even more interest."
2,not waterproof,I got five of these diaper covers (after having another brand that worked fine) and I was surprised to discover that they are not waterproof at all ... my son's bed is wet after an hour nap!!!
2,Brotherhood of the Cobra Slaughters the English Language,"While the plot for this book was fairly good, the English language was slaughtered. The book was badly in need of some editing for its grammar, spelling and punctuation. Mason's high school English teacher must be turning over in her grave."
5,How To Use Your Mac,"Your book, How To Use Your Mac, is excellent. I wish I had it even earlier in my learning curve. Beautifully organized and easy to find subjects.Illustrations are very reader friendly for the beginner. A nice piece of work that I hope receives the recognition it deserves. This is the real missing manual for beginners."
5,Historical Treasures,"""Black Vocal Groups, Volume 8"" is a great collection of vintage, pre-war 78 rpm records. After reading the previous posting, all I have to say is that he must have been unaware of what Document Records is all about....the preservation of these old records without altering them in any way, this practice gives you the feeling of listening to the old 78's on an old record player....a purely nostalgic feeling. For those who enjoy old, pre-war gospel music, this collection is for you...for others, it will be of little interest."
3,Can't really go wrong with Space,"I bought the Space Ibiza CD from 2000, which is a masterpiece, recorded live in the club so I had to buy this disk. This disk has a great complication of music, though I prefer house/dance music with some vocals, which this has little. Other than that, this disk provides some great funky music."
2,This Book Is OK,I read this book and I was happy because I never see any stories about skateboarding and it is very fun to read.
2,no surprises here,"If you were hoping for the visual rehash of THE CLIMB or INTO THIN AIR keep looking. This video's another poorly shot saga of a middled aged dude with summit fever and the guide who lost his toes deciding between nobility and a life wracked with guilt. There's not much to engage the viewer on a personal, emotional level in spite of the dramatic circumstances. But if watching a talking head shot of a moody guy in a tent is your idea of good video...."
5,Sensational and tragic - an epic story - excellent.,"The Fatal Climb takes you as high as you can go on Everest - the summit! The story is inspiring and tragic all at the same time, with live footage from the very spot (just above the 2nd Step on the North Ridge) where disaster strikes. It is a story of one man's obsession with reaching Everest's summit (at all costs) and another man's battle with feelings of incredible guilt. I thoroughly recommend this video to anyone who has ever wanted to see what it's really like at extreme altitude and how dangerous it really is. This video will make you laugh and cry - it's incredible!"
1,Fatal Game,"The Fatal Climb story was told in 1997 - The Fatal Game - [...] even the log line is the same - ""One mans dream became another mans nightmare"". How do I know? I produced The Fatal Game. It sold into every territory in the world and won 28 awards. Its a fantastic story and deserves to be told in as many iterations as possible. I guess plagery is the best kind of flattery."
4,Helpful Programming Reference,"A more accurate title may be ""The Under-Documented PC."" There seems to be a lot of information about the PC on a higher level, but very little is applicable to the programmer that wants to access the hardware directly or at the BIOS level. This book fills much of the information gap.The revised, second, edition has been improved in several areas while retaining the overall format of the original volume.Highly recommended for those who write operating system and similar software for the PC platform. Also valuable for those who want to know more about ""what's under the hood."""
3,"A little dated, but still great for 16-bit development","This is a great book, or I should say WAS a great book. While the information is still 100% applicable if you are still writing code for a 16-bit operating system (DOS), or writing your own operating system, much of the information becomes somewhat useless when applied to 32-bit operating systems (Windows 2000, Linux).Still, when writing low-level code it is still a useful reference, one of the few out there.Gilluwe includes source code samples, and is one of the most comprehensive books on the PC architecture.Unfortunately, this book is now somewhat dated. The BIOS is no longer the de-facto method of controlling the hardware, and is a big headache under 32 bit protected operating systems (Linux, Windows 2000, etc). Newer features, like PCI configuration space, NVRAM, BIOS 32 directory services, DMI and SMBIOS are not covered."
5,One of 10 best this year,"I buy way too many cds, so the fact that this cd is one of my top 10 favorite 2001 releases that I bought this year make it my sleeper pick of the year. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
5,One fine CD,Reminiscent of Six String Drag and the Bottle Rockets. Joe's voice is strong and deep. I happened on this record at emusic and was pleasantly amazed at the depth and quality. Would love to catch one of this guy's live shows.
4,Loved by man and beast,"My husband really wanted one of these. It came in really quickly. He didn't even let me wash it before he put it on. He's 6'2"" 200lbs. I got him the XL and it fits perfectly. I've since washed it and it still fits well. The only thing that would make it better if #1- it came in other colors, and #2- it had a snap or button flap on the butt. The back opening is more like the opening on men's brief. My husband's is active duty, and it would be helpful if he could wear these under his uniforms when he's ""active"" down range or in the field. It's doable, but not as practical as it could be. Nonetheless, we love it... and he looks really cute in it."
4,Indera Union Suit - Reccomended Buy,"Perfect fit and perfectly warm. Bargain priced too. The perfect combination for a union suit. If I could change anything it would be the color as Red is not my favorite. But then these are under the layers and not on top, at least if you are doing it right. I reccomend this item."
4,old fashion long underwear,"The garment fit well as sized, spot on. It is cotton, so it is not a geez whiz, keep you warm in any temperature, fabric. I got it more for the nostalgia and the fact that it is a one-piece; I always seem to loose the other half. Buttons are well placed and where you need them."
2,Flap is terrible,These are nice underwear but not really what you would call thermal. The reason for the low rating is the lack of a rear flap. They just put a vertical slit with 1 button. Very uncomfortable to use if you have to sit down and do your thing
2,Way to big,sizes are very misleading. If you order them get two sizes smaller. Just because im bigger around doesn't mean im 8 feet tall. So thin you can actually see through them. will not order again.
2,cheap Chinese made junk,"Product is Chinese made of light, tee shirt material and not suitable for 'mastering' the cold weather, as advertised. Also Labelled with a generic industrial brand name (ROTHCO) and not 'Indera Mills'Threads were loose and pulling from the seams out of the package and buttons popped when i tried it on.Junk. Junk. Junk"
2,Button holes too small/buttons came off,My son was so excited to wear these... The first hour they kept coming unbutton up & down the length of the union suit ... Basically the buttons were too small for the button holes ... Even a button came off the rear end ... Very disappointed... Even paid extra for tall size ... Sending them back ;(
3,Not what I expected.,"This book really was an analysis of several leader development programs as they existed a decade or so ago. I'm sure it was more helpful then than it is now.It can be helpful to read a book like this if you are interested in how to assess the value of those types of programs or how to develop them, but it should now be read not for the particulars of those that were covered (they've all changed to a degree, some considerably), but to gain an appreciation for how to approach leader development programs in general."
3,Too much spesialized,"The book is useful only to actors because it contains too many exercises and details on voice production and support. It's very complicated and very large. However as the actors said, it's a bible for them. Buy it only if you are an actor..."
5,another desert island disc with my favorite cure songs!,this is a compilation of the cure's singles 1987-1997. every song on here is a classic. my favorite is wrong number. get the video for this too! they also make sweet music videos.
4,A great find!,"This is the album that introduced me to The Cure. I found it in a box of random cds near a dumpster of an apartment complex. Now I don't know why someone would want to throw this cd away because I think it is fantastic, I guess one persons trash is anothers treasure. Personally I like the first half of the album better than the second, but in general all the songs are decent. My favorite is lullaby! Like another reviewer wrote it is eerie and I love the lyrics and the video as well--go check it out. Other than lullaby my other favorites are why can't I be you, hot hot hot, fascination street, wrong number and gone! I give it a 4/ 5 and definitely recommend it!"
3,Best of? Not really.,"Though ""Galore"" holds a lot of really good songs (""Friday I'm In Love"", ""Love Song""), this really isn't the best place to start with the Cure.The problem? This is the weakest time period in the Cure's recording history. Sure they made ""Disintigration"" during this time period, but they also made ""Wild Mood Swings"". Do you see what I'm talking about?Of the songs on here, there are some really stellar numbers, like ""Just Like Heaven"", ""Friday I'm In Love"", ""Just Like Heaven"" and all of the Cure's good singles from ""Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me"" to ""Wild Mood Swings"". But why do you need to shorten ""Pictures of You""? And why even bother putting songs from ""Wild Mood Swings"" on because they are just going to bring you down.If you are just getting into the Cure, ""Staring at the Sea"" is a better place to start. After you get that, go ahead and get this one, because it will show you whether or not you'll get into latter day Cure."
3,commercial ventures,"I love The Cure. They are brilliant and have generated a lasting catalogue of memorable music. My problem with this collection is that there are some truly great bands, whose finer repertoire is seen by going past the ""singles"" and into the meat of each disc.I understand that commercial interests won out with this one and I have no problem with procuring a collections disc on top of all the others; but what I would have liked is more sauce with the meal. Most Cure enthusiasts like me already have these singles within the regular discs. Please give us interesting remixes and more new singles - something to make the purchase truly worthwhile!Don't taunt us with just a few new things and a bunch of stuff we already have! Thank you.In the age of burning and file sharing, we deserve a lot more for our money."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT,Enough said LOVE IT! A mix of some of the more popular Cure songs....if you are a fan....and don't have this CD...get it :))
4,not quite there,"to be as indisputably inferior to the cure's first singles comp, _staring at the sea_ (one of the ten greatest albums of the 80s), as this is, it's still a tasty plateful of poppy goth music. it's funny how the cure is always seen as this mopey, depressed, death-obsessed bunch of guys, while their singles always seem so full of life and celebration. who knows why? here we have ""why can't i be you,"" ""friday i'm in love,"" ""lovesong,"" and even the fun techno remix of my favorite cure song, ""close to me."" two entirely different and simply fantastic greatest hits collections for one band...believe it."
4,Simple rundown,"This is a simple breakdown of the cure's greatest/most popular songs. Period. I would reccommend it for people who are interested/enjoy the Cure but dont feel the need to listen to all the ""other"" songs on their albums. Plain and simple, but this CD, listen to it in the car, and smile at where you were when you first heard these excellent and well-written tunes."
3,"Sound Check, please!","The songs themselves are as good as everyone says, however, there's a major problem with the mastering on this collection! Some songs (e.g., ""Close to Me"") are so soft that I have to crank up the volume on my headphones to make out the words, and then when louder songs come on (e.g., ""Friday I'm in Love""), my ears get blasted and I have to rush to turn it back down again. Not a fun listening experience, despite the brilliant tunes! I'd be interested to hear if people buying the CD version have the same problem or if it's just the mp3 album."
5,Excellent educational toy!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 8 months old. That was over a year ago and she STILL plays with this toy! She was able to do simple wooden puzzles at a very young age (by 12 months or so), and I give credit to this toy for helping her learn to do that.The cookies are magnetic, so if your child puts them in the general direction of the matching hole, they will slide right in. They also stick together (I loved watching her put two together and then look confused when the third wouldn't stick because of the magnetic quality!).One drawback...this toy is rather loud for my taste. The music is catchy and there are two settings - one for music and one for learning. But a lower volume would make this the perfect toy to keep in the car."
4,Fun toy,"I bought this toy for my son when he was around 6 months old and it is still a daily favorite at 14 months. I agree with the review about the possessed gingerbread man. Randomly, the toy goes off without anyone touching it."
4,A very clever toy!,"My 11-month old daughter is really enjoying this toy. It lights up, plays music, and teaches about different textures, shapes, and colors. Designed in an adorable cookie tray, this toy is perfect for any infant."
3,Good for teething,"I purchased this for my 8 mos old grandson for Christmas, the coloful blinking lights and music get his attention, however, he prefers to pick up the ""cookie"" and chew on it as if chewing on a teething ring. I don't think at this age he gets the concept yet. My 2 1/2 grandaughter played with it briefly but didn't hold her attention for any lenght of time."
4,Squishy Cookie,"My 11 month old son especially likes the texture of the squishy cookie. There are four cookies/shapes to this puzzle and he doesn't know how to fit any of them back into the ""puzzle"" yet, but he still LOVES this toy. He loves the silly song it sings, the noises it makes, the textures and sounds of each individual piece. I couldn't be more pleased and pleasantly surprised with what a hit this simple toy is."
5,Really Great Toy!,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 15 months old. He has loved it and played with it practically every day since I purchased it. The sounds are nice, not annoying like some toys."
1,A choking hazard!,"I bought this toy for my child. She loved it until this morning! She just got one of her first teeth the other day. She was playing with this today and somehow bit a piece of fabric right off of the whoozit's nose. It landed way back in her throat and she was gagging on it. Finally she must have swallowed it...I was not able to get it out. Be very careful if you buy this. Once they get teeth, it is NOT safe for you baby!"
1,Complete waste of money.,"My husband and I bought this combo for the humm dinger. What a horrible purchase! These don't really vibe all that much, and the band to hold them on is thin and snapped(which was very unpleasant!!!)."
3,Dill Scallion rides again!,"This is a pleasant little film with an amiable cast. It's always fun to see Billy Burke in a starring role. You may think you know where this is going from the first view of the corpse in the trunk, but you'd probably be wrong. There's a touching side trip to Charleston, where Jimmy (Burke) faces down some old demons, even if the film never knows quite what to do with the Jake Busey character after this, and Neve Campbell is properly enigmatic as ""the girl""--she's femme enough without being overly fatale. My favorite scene is when Dill, er, Billy, er, Jimmy sings along with a tape of Fred Neil on ""Other Side of This Life."" If you've never seen ""Dill Scallion,"" it's a much better film than ""Lost Junction,"" but this one is okay, an agreeable time-waster, if a bit more beige than noir. But that's fine too."
4,Lost Junction,"This movie start's out with a twist and it stays there until the end. Ifyou like Neve Campbell this is your movie, she is at her best. She playsa woman of mystery on a mission. Not great, but a good movie."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This movie doesn't even deserve a *star*.Lousy movie.......instead of Lost Junction, it should be called LOST TIME!"
5,Very cool Hobo Knife!!,At work we are always out of silverware. So I bought this to fill the void. The fact that it separates easily is awesome!! Works great!
2,Let the Reader Beware!,"Nobody denies the quantity of research that has gone into this book and its successor volume. But can it be trusted? Unfortunately, not altogether. I have not gone through all of the notes. Probably nobody has. Many of the sources are hard to access, after all, and there are hundreds of them. But, like several colleagues and acquaintances, I have examined a number of the notes very carefully. What I have discovered casts real doubt on Quinn's reputation for meticulousness. Often, the notes appear to be padded with irrelevant material. Frequently, too, the sources don't say what Quinn says they do. Sadly, I conclude from my sample that this book cannot be trusted."
1,Origins of Nonsense,Dr. Quinn is very skilled at presenting the form of history without the substance. An interesting exercise is to follow up on his references. He carefully manipulates many of these to destroy the original context and support his personal views.
1,Inaccurate,"Mr. Quinn is biased and unfortunately these spill over into the work. I know of a man who said he had been told that Mormons believed this-or-that (it is unimportant except that it wasn't true). When told that it wasn't true he protested ""But I was told that by my minister."" I asked him who he worked for. ""I sell for Xerox"" My response was ""Can I believe what IBM says about your product?"" He said ""Your point is made... I should go to the source."" The same is true here and I am at the source, and this is inaccurate."
3,convincing but only a part of the discourse,"The book is an interesting one. I found it somewhat persuasive in its arguments, however some of the primary sources that he uses could be interpreted differently. I've read a couple of reviews that said after reading Quinn's work they left the LDS church, that is unfortunate because Quinn is not the final word on the topics he treats. One should always look at author's who offer a different picture using the same primary sources that Quinn uses. Also, one could argue that Quinn is a biased historian since he was excommunicated from the church he is writing about. It's like writing a book about the IRS just after they've audited you and took everything you had. Would your book be considered objective? Apply that logic to Quinn's work and enjoy."
4,Good Stuff,"If you don't like music in this genre, you won't like this CD. I think that should justify any negative ratings this CD would recieve. On the other hand, if you have a sensible reason for not liking this CD I would like to hear it (haven't heard any so far)... I like this CD. Definitely not their greatest album, but, as the song implies, its ""good""."
5,Great Cd from a great band,"This is a great CD that you can listen to over and over agian. They had a couple big hits with this CD(i.e ""Good"")but my personal favorites are ""Heaven"" and ""This Time of Year"" It is a must have CD for any Alternative Rock fan."
5,Great sound...,"Not as jarring on the senses as a lot of things I've heard lately, this CD (while older) is still one of the better debuts I've heard. Kudos especially to ""Porcelein"" and ""Coyote""...it's a rare rock-genre band that can incorporate so much of a country twang without becoming harsh and annoying."
5,Great First Release,"Better Than Ezra first release Deluxe is a hit. The songs are real catchy and all the songs are great. My favorite two is ""Good"" and ""Teenager"" this is a must buy!"
3,Hit and Miss pop record,"I like most people (everybody) bought this album because of the song ""Good."" Hey, it's one of the greatest songs of the '90s, no doubt. And there were a few one-hit wonders from the '90s that actually made some quality albums, the Wallflowers and Gin Blossoms come to mind. Well, Better than Ezra has not really made a great album, but they made a pretty good one. Yes, ""Good"" is the best song on the album, probably followed by ""Rosealia."" The songs are very pop and might seem a tad light to some people that like their rock a little harder, but if you want some mellow and non-threatening tunes to chill to, this is the ticket."
2,They May Be Better Than Ezra,But they can't match the peerless genius of Nehemiah! I recommend the NRSV!
4,Good,"Back in 1995, BTE was still recovering from the accidental death of their lead guitarist, and--to some degree--stuggling to find a sound of the own (for BTE's mature sound, check out the just released CLOSER). The result on DELUXE is a record of songs the are equal parts The Replacements and Cheap Trick. I'm sure you've heard the hit single ""Good,"" and your opinion of that song is a pretty good indicator. If you don't like it, there's probably nothing else on the disc that's going to change your mind. Other highlights include ""Roselia,"" ""This Time of Year,"" ""In the Blood,"" ""Porcelain,"" and ""Killer Inside."""
4,U2 Plays Loud and Tough,"This was the third U2 album I bought, after Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree. There's nothing like listening to the young, raw, drive of 'Like a Song' when you're in a down mood. It's a good third album to buy if you're exploring U2. This is a great display of U2's early fire, without the almost untrained (but still fun to hear) music on Boy or October. If you start here, and then listen to later U2 songs, like 'Some Days Are Better Than Others' on Zooropa, or 'New York' on All That You Can't Leave Behind, you'll get a taste for just how much staying power and talent this band really has. No band has experimented as broadly and well with so many sounds and styles as U2 has.Only 4 stars, though, because the lyrics and musicality on some of the tracks seem a little trite. U2 doesn't grow into their angst for a couple of albums =)."
2,"Great songs, lousy cd pressing.","This cd is a classic for it's songs. ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"", ""New Year's Day"", ""Two Hearts Beat as One"" and others on this are outstanding.However, Comparing the sound quality between say Vinyl Special Edition LPs and this cd is apples and oranges. It is heavy with that annoying CD brightness.songs a 10, sound not worth it. I once owned a 45 LP of A:""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"", and B:""New Year's Day"" english only pressing. That was fantastic."
5,U2's best,"I wrote a review on U2's newest ablum, ""How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"" and forgot to mention a few things. I have loved U2 since first seeing the video for ""Gloria"". I can't remember how old I was, maybe 12, and that image has been burned in my brain. I am now 35, and still love U2. This album is U2 at their absolute best. I think everyone who is too young to remember or who weren't born yet and like the new stuff, to listen to this. This is truly a masterpiece. So much better then anything recent or from Achtung Baby. I give credit to U2 for staying together for 25+ years but sometimes I just long for bands like Nirvana, The Clash, or The Sex Pistols. Theese bands had a brief moment of fame, but are remembered for greatness. It is a shame that U2 is leaving legacy of medicore music that may just make everyone forget just how great they were at one time. Please, listen to this album, and see just how inspirational music from U2 can be."
3,It's A Good Listen,"I've been playing U2's 1983 album ""War"" for the past few days now, given it numerous spins, but I'm a little dissopointed. With only ten tracks, I was expecting them to rip through it. Having been told it was such a political album and a must have for any U2 fan, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.Sure, it's a really good listen. The first four or five tracks are amazing, the standouts being ""New Year's Day"" and ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"". I can't get enough of the latter, it's got such deep verses, great instruments and such an addictive chorus. With such an amazing opening to the album with these few tracks, I was sure it was going to be a classic. However, the second half of the album is weak. It's listenable and I do like it, I just tend to loose focus and interest at about track seven.If you're a U2 fan of any description, I really do reccommend it. If not, you can pass on this. I was really let down. 3 stars."
3,The beginning of something great,"With this album, U2 reach the international market with hits like ""Sunday bloody Sunday"", and ""New year's day"". Other tracks are really good like ""Surrender"" and ""40"", the rest is good but not great.The best was just coming soon..."
5,Best U2 Album!!!,U2 arrived with this album. Intense songwriting and just plain great music. A staple for every music fan's library. I never get bored listening to this CD. Do your ears a favor and buy this work of art.
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"Raw, energy filled, CLASSIC--MUST HAVE for anyone wanting to remember when U2 still had some of that punk in them. Absolutely have to have!!!"
4,Buen rock,"Esta grabación contiene temas muy buenos del grupo, un sonido único y para tener como colección de un seguidor de estos grandes músicos."
4,RAW U2!!!!,"This must be the rawest U2 album...In my opinion, it's from WAR that U2 really start to create solid songs...in the first 2 records, the band is very young and BONO wasn't the GREAT vocalist he will become...the EDGE too...WAR got some U2 ALL time classics NEW YEAR'S DAY, SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY and Two hearts beat as one...Really like WAR, but U2 still will become a ROCK LEGEND after this..."
4,"Great album, great packaging, not so great b-sides","I love this album. This is what got me fired up about U2. I love the passion, the frustration, the emotion of this album. This album was the end of an era for U2 as they would go on to break new ground. However, I always go back to this album as the pinnacle of their ""passionate period""...sort of a trilogy beginning with Boy, moving on to October and then War....these are my favorite U2 albums.- I'm not as thrilled with the b-sides (probably my least favorite of the remastered deluxe edition b-sides). A lot of remixes, etc.However, i love the packaging, pictures, lyrics, etc and am glad to have made the purchase (a used copy...the new price is a bit high)."
2,"Love the Album, Hate the Remaster","I was SO looking forward to hearing this remastered CD because War is by far my favorite U2 album, largely because it was my introduction to the band back in the early 80s. I was also really looking forward to the remaster because I always thought that the original War album sounded incredibly tinny with very little low end. I was hoping the remaster would fix this, but it really does not. What a bummer! One listen to Sunday Bloody Sunday shows how little ""bottom"" there is to this remaster (and the original). When the bass guitar finally kicks in at about 0:30, you have to listen to hear it practically. The bass simply has no punch on the remaster. Despite this I still love the album, but I hate the remaster. Don't buy this just for the remaster."
5,U2 Break Through,"WAR was a breakthrough for U2, after the slight stumble of OCTOBER, and the remastering treatment that Universal has given it is warm and crisp, not harsh and shrill, so that you feel like you're in the room with the band. On this album, the band's sound and style, which combines new wave with 70s hard rock, starts to peak, with political, spiritual, and romantic concerns being given equal weight lyrically. Now that this album, THE JOSHUA TREE, and the first two albums have been remastered, now we can all hope for THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE to receive the same treatment."
5,U2's best?,"Well, either that or The Joshua Tree. This is a must-have for any self-respecting fan of the group. Everybody knows the cathariatic protest Sunday Bloody Sunday, a driving antiwar song and a true classic. Even better (to me, anyway) is New Year's Day, the album's other big hit - unforgettable indeed. You don't hear much about Seconds, Like a Song..., Two Hearts Beat As One, Red Light or the vaguely Talking Heads-esque Refugee, but they're all as good as the hits, and Bono's vocals are at their peak. Drowning Man is filler, but overall War is one of U2's greatest albums."
3,How did U2 get this one so wrong?,"I was really excited to have the first three U2 albums remastered with bonus tracks for the first time. These are my favorite U2 records (I am off the train after The Joshua Tree) and the b-sides, single only cuts and live tracks are nice to have in one package. So, how did the band screw up War's bonus material? By including some lame New Year's Day Ferry Corsten remixes instead of the original 12"" versions. It's really nothing short of a slap in the face to the fans, whom i'm sure would like to have seen only original period songs included. October makes the same mistake by adding the Common Ground remix of Tomorrow, but that's a minor quibble. And while I know it would have been impossible to get ALL the War versions on the 2nd cd, it would have been in keeping with the spirit of the records to just play it straight. A five star record knocked down to three - what a shame....The other cds BOY **** and OCTOBER *****"
3,Worth listenting to,"As a confirmed pacifist, U2's War was one of a selection of tapes I played as the Gulf War raged on, sort of as a protest to war in general. Listening to it alongside works by the Clash and Bob Dylan, I was surprised to find how dated the album sounds. Certainly, the first three tracks are political anthems, and ""Surrender"" swings along, but the middle portion of the album sounds musically stale with the notable exception of ""Two Hearts Beat As One."" This is unfortunate for Bono finally has some great lyrical ideas; it's just that he has precious little to hang them on. When I first bought this album, I would have given it at least a 4 star rating, but for now it just doesn't move me as much as it used to."
3,U2-War,"I recently listened to this cd, and i enjoyed it, but i wouldn't buy the cd given the chance. With only 10 songs on the album, too many of the songs came off week. The greatest songs on this album were probably, ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""Like A Song"". So i would recommend trying to listen to the cd before going and spending your money on it."
4,great sound from an at the time young firey band,"This album has just an awesome classic analog tape sound. I wouldn't be surprised if these were recorded live in the studio. 'sunday, bloody sunday' and 'new years day' are my two favorites but this is an ALBUM in the true sense of the word. its a well rounded collection of songs the flow together well and have a certain relativity to one another. All in all, an excellent record from a young angry band who were speaking out about the things going on in the world and the solution we should all strive for."
5,Fantastic Follow-Up To Worldwide Smash,"The problem with having a worldwide smash debut that wins 5 Grammys is, ""How do you follow THAT?"" Christopher Cross managed to do it beautifully with these songs that capture his quiet grace along with his now classic ""Pop n'Roll"".The fantastic mix includes fun, up tempo tunes like ""Deal 'Em Again"", ""No Time For Talk"" and ""All Right"" along with the quiet, introspective compositions ""Long World"", ""Talking In My Sleep"" and the hit ""Think Of Laura"".This album may not have escaped the shadow of Cross' 1st album at the time of its release, but looking back now, it's every bit as good -- if not just a little bit better."
4,THIS ONE WAS DECENT AS WELL,"i did not enjoy this one as much as the other one, but i do love THINK OF LAURA and ALL RIGHT. the first for the arragement and the other for the inspiration. this is an album i can just enjoy a lazy day to."
3,Low recording levels???,Is it just me or was this tranfered at a very low volume level?Anyone happen to know if the limited edition out there now has been improved ?
4,Purchase-related review,"The product came impecable, inside the normal plastic seal.The delivery (in normal mode) was very slow, although within the previewed date"
5,This is a very wonderful song by a very wonderfull artist,"I personnaly view this classical song as a very challenging one. I love it's composition, rhythm, tune and classical beats. The classical composition of this wonderful song has not yet been challenged by any of the upcoming classical musicians."
3,Pictures of Ziggy,"Great songs, and overall good performances, but most of these versions are close to note-for-note versions of the originals. The Bowie version of ""Pictures of Lily"" is the one real departure, and it works on several levels. The tempo, production, and instrumentation are reminiscent of Ziggy-era Bowie (especially ""All the Young Dudes"" or ""Ziggy Stardust""). In this context, the lyrics take on extra meaning--you can imagine the young boy ""relieved"" by the pictures of Lily Langtry on the wall inspired to grow up to be a cross-dressing glam rocker. A great version, and one truer to the spirit of a good cover--respecting the original, but making it your own."
4,"Good, but definitely not great","I liked all the songs except Paul Weller's ""Circles"" and David Bowie doing ""Pictures Of Lilly"" way to slowly, these guys are the grandfathers of punk, why is that song so slow. It's twice as long as the original. some songs were standouts: Sheryl Crow's rendition of ""Behind Blue Eyes"" was great, Phish doing ""5.15"" is excellent."
3,"Overlooking 'The Who""",Although this collection covers most of the most popular pieces recorded by The Who it lacks the unique artistry of the original recordings. The fresh approach by the different artists can evoke a new interest in the pieces and stimulate people to investigate the original.
1,b-list kareoke,"Once again the Who get dissed! They had to scrape the bottom of the barrel for half the ""talent"" on this disc. The idea of a tribute album is for the artist paying tribute to arrange the song in their own style. That does not happen here. Only Bowie does the job right. Most of this drek is taken from live shows where b-list groups attempt to pull off a Who song. I had to play Who's Next at full volume to get this crap out of my head!! Phish doing 5:15??? Run from this mess!"
3,Bowie's Fantastic,"I absolutley love David Bowie's version of Pictures of Lily! I put it on repeat over and over, I can't stop!! Buy this album, even if it's only to hear Bowie's version of Pictures of lily! It's worth it!!"
1,Don't Bother,"This piffle of a book can be read in one short sitting. If not for the extra-large typeface and huge margins that take up half of each page, the text would probably run about 30 pages. Here you will learn little about the Black Dahlia murder, less about surrealism, and next to nothing about any connection between the two. Can I have my money back?I think it is indicative of the poor quality and sleazy nature of this book that all the positive reviews posted here were written by people who know the authors personally. Most are mentioned by name in the book's ackowledgments. Yet most pretend to be ""average readers"" just discoving the book. Don't fall for this swindle!"
1,Diaphanous,"A complete and utter misrepresentation of the Surrealist movement and its various ethics and ideologies. The layman's text spills ambivalent from the page in a tawdry and lurid... almost ""gossip column"" and ersatz distortion of the period in which the murder actually occurred. Sensationalism and faux-intellectualism run rampant, bleeding and sore... a trifle; a magazine of a book.Flimsy connections that you could pick out of a hat and downright ignorance of the subject matter, on the end of both the murder and the ""connection(s)"" to Man Ray; thus connections to the Surrealist movement.If you plan for extended defecations, this book may serve you well... convulsive images..."
1,Rotten,"I can't see anyone finding much value in this book except the kind of people who enjoy looking at pictures of mutilated dead bodies. Even that group ought to save their money, as the photos here have probably already been scanned and posted all over the internet by now, thanks to the more industrious members of that particular club. What little else there is of this book hardly bears mentioning. It amounts to little more than a poorly organized magazine article attempting to connect an almost random selection of art works to the crime. Sort of throw back to the old-time practice of dressing up prurient material as ""educational,"" I suppose."
4,"Strange, Yet Convincing",This unusual book argues that the killer of Elizabeth Short aka the Black Dahlia was a Surrealist who worked on the Hollywood scene. It does provide a surprisingly convincing case that the killer was a member of a particular artistic school that had a particularly strong influence on the movies of the time.The book is very well illustrated with ghastly photos from the crime scene and is recommended to all true crime buffs.
3,Mandor's rampage,Hello are you a G Gundam fan? If so listen up! This is a Gundam unlike any other. It does not have legs and half the face is covered. This is not the toy for impatient people because of the constant re assembling. Though he has a wicked weapon they could have done better
4,"Different species, different language.","As the owner of a 50-pound terrier mix who was not trained correctly and then experienced a period of abuse and neglect, this book has been extremely influential in how I communicate with my dog, and how I recognize what my dog is communicating to me. The book was recommended to me by an excellent trainer from Las Vegas, Nevada, and I have relied on it ever since to help me recognize signs of stress and boredom in my dog, develop a more effective training program, and recognize the true causes and remedies for destructive behaviors. This book should be required reading for all pet owners. There would be many more happy pets and happy owners."
5,RARE and cancelled...,"YOU are lucky if you find it beacause it was release and a few time after cancelled... so a FEW of them were sold ! And B-sides on it are ...WOW! ""Never Be Free"" is one of my favorite B-side !! this is even better than ""enough is never enough"" and ""girl don't come""!MAB"
5,The Best Garbage Single Ever!!!,"I purchased this single and let me tell you the b-sides are unbelievable! You simply have to hear Never Be Free....it will blow you away! The very first time I heard Never Be Free, I literally had to sit down because I could not believe what I was hearing. The other b-sides, Honeybee and Badass are also great! Honeybee was to be included on Bleed Like Me; however, it was taken off. The track is very reminiscent of the sound of the album. Now Badass is just a fun song to listen to. It will most likely take a few listens, but you will love it, I guarantee it!"
3,Mediocre,"I waited for a review on this single for a while, but when no one posted one I just went ahead and bought it... and now I'm thinking I should have just waited longer. It's not that the included b-sides are 'bad' per se, it's just that they're nothing special. The 'ruff demo' is definitely 'ruff' and you probably won't listen to it more than once. The other 2 b-sides are very generic rockers. The 'why do you love me' b-sides are much better."
5,attracted to the light,The starn twins have always broadened the confines of the photographic world. A must have if you are interested in non-traditional photography. Graphic images of insects up close and made to look like the fragile beings that they are.
2,Waste of money,"This is not what you would think it is, not worth the money Pierce Bronan is only on a small part of the DVD.There are 6 DVD's to the set and only 2 or 3 are worth watching."
2,"Rubs off on towel, stains shower floor, reduces shine","I give this stars because it does condition. However, it stained the shower floor, rubbed off on my white towel and reduced the shine in my hair. When my hair is short and layered, as it is now, I use the True Red shampoo and the Leave-In conditioner, which I wash out. If I want to air dry curly, I towel dry, rub (don't comb) in a dab of Brilliantine and just a touch of B&B Curl Mousse, fluff and scrunch and leave to dry. If I want to blow dry, I use just a dab of Super Rich conditioner instead, wash out, rub and comb in just a dab of Brilliantine and blow dry without further product. I use henna - no chemicals - and B&B has always worked better for me than any other product."
3,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed that ""modern"" music was put along with the Silent films on this DVD. Not very authentic."
4,Charming historical stories,"The stories are written in the charming style familiar to me from stories by my great-aunts' youth. The pacing isn't always as fast as we're now used to, but it's fun to read if you're into history.My one gripe is that the scan clean-up is inconsistent. Most parts are perfect, but there are sections where it's distractingly littered with random consonants, mainly an accented ""r"", and run-on words. There have been a few places where I'm unsure if the entire sentence is there. Apparently one of the volunteers wasn't as good at this as the others."
2,Historical Mysteries,"THis book was boring, boring, boring and too technical. Therefore I did not finish reading it. I could not recommend it to anyone who doesn't like cereberial (?) reading."
2,Really Dry,"I normally ready mysteries, thrillers, spy and intrique and real-crime stories if they are well written. I am not sure what I expected from this book but it read like a text book rather than a myster/crime story that should flow."
3,"Okay, not great","The Innocent was a good book but I didn't love it. There wasn't too much romance and I never felt like I got to know the hero. The suspense was pretty good though. I think gt6243c, the first reviewer, is talking about the second book in the Eden's Children series, The Tempted. That book does have a lot of flashbacks that seem to take up a lot of the book. The Innocent doesn't. It all takes place in the present and it IS the first book in the series."
3,Kind of Confusing,"This book is part of a miniseries, which seems to be centered around the disappearance of children in Eden, Mississippi. Because this is the first book I had read but not the first in the series, it took me a few chapters to get into the story. The story relies heavily on flashbacks that make it more difficult for the story to flow. The story's resolution is a too neat in some ways but does not give the reader that sense of closure that I feel is important."
1,well....,"I guess there is a reason why an item that has an MSRP of $318 is selling for around $100. It looks so plastic and cheap. The battery compartment door barely sits in place and the whole unit feels NOT so sturdy. The only heavy duty item in this package is the carrying case, not the unit. Mine didn't even work and was DOA. It was funny, as I was inspecting the unit trying to figure out why it didn't work and I noticed the QA tag on the bottom of the unit and the date and the initials of the person who had tested the unit. Well the most important test was forgotten I guess!?!? I have called and got a replacement unit on the way, but I was a second away from just returning the whole thing and getting something else. If you're looking for a heavy duty and professional tool, look elsewhere, it isn't this one!"
1,Junk,Rust! Rust! Rust! Just after a year I have holes in this crap. Pay the extra money n buy the chrome. This is junk!!!!
3,hitch step,"The product seems sturdy, easy to install, i hope the anti rattle bracket doesnt fall off, but i do have one cracked end cap, wonder how to go about getting a new one."
4,Works OK,"Works OK for the purpose I bought it, however it is a little loose in the hitch socket the clamp on th e bottom is a nice touch"
4,Looks Good,"Seems to be well designed and made. Fits nicely on my Dodge Ram, but is a little lose in the receiver. It has a a anti-rattle devise that works pretty well."
5,dirt farmer,"this is a fantastic product!!! I have 2 of them, on each of my pickup trucks. At age 65 it makes getting up in the truck bed much easier and also much safer. I wouldn't be without this product. Thanks to ""Go Rhino"" for coming up with this handy device."
3,So-so.,"I'm moving to the South so I thought I should learn a few things about the culture. I learned a few new things, but a lot of this book is just fluff - bland lists of things you don't need to know. Lists of football championships, who to mail-order hams from, etc. I did like the info dealing with Southern religions as I didn't know much about the difference between say Baptists and Holy Rollers."
3,Workmanlike Western,"Texas Spurs was originally published in 1955 and is a typical Western paperback original of its period being undistinguished but perfectly readable ,if this type of book is your thing.Its hero is Mark Regan ,part owner of a cattle herd newly arrived in Colorado from Texas.His partner is ambushed and killed by a man employed by a local businessman ,and crook ,Ed Varden ,a man whose methods of expanding his ranching empire pay but scant regard to the law .Varden has the local lawman,Moody ,in his back pocket and he also indulges in blackmail in order to get his way.A nasty piece of work in short.Regan sets out to bring him down in a sturdy if stereotypical plot with one interesting twist -it is a minor character rather than the hero who plays a decisive role in the climax .The prose is functional ,the characterisataion lacks depth but the plot is just about lively enough to sustain interest ,if you are a genre devotee ."
4,Good knives for the money,"I needed a new set of knives that didn't have the ragged edges so saw this one for a fair price.They're a little more maintenance than my other knives as they need to be washed by hand and dried immediately so they won't rust. Can't throw them in the dishwasher either (that rust thing again).Also, the handles on the image looks like it's the same finish as the blade but in fact, has a painted gray looking finish. They're sharp and needs little maintenance in that department.Overall, if you want to upgrade your knives but don't want to spend a bundle, then this set is for you. I highly recomend it for that purpose."
4,Good knives for the price,These knives are very lightweight and have a matte finish which matches great with our cookware. I recommend them!
5,Awesome!!,"I like this whole set alot. I think they are even sharper and more easy to handle than my Caphalon knives. The handles are comfortable, the blades are sharp, this set came with bonus shears and a knife sharpener also. I like them so much, I am hand-washing them to keep them in perfect condition."
4,Very Nice Knife Set - Recommended,"We have used the Chicago Cutlery Insignia Matte 12-Piece Block Set for about three years. This set has held up well and has been fairly easy to maintain, as the knives keep their edges for a long time. They do have to be hand washed after each use, but that is to be expected with this type of good quality cutlery.The set includes a 3.5"" paring knife, 5"" utility knife, 8"" bread knife, 8"" chef knife, 8"" sharpening steel, six 4.5"" steak knives, and a hardwood block.We are very pleased with this set, Recommended!"
5,"Very long, and very good",This movie is really really long.. it felt like it went on forever. But it was really interesting and they really backed everything up with well documented evidence
1,Not Up to Par,This one doesn't cmpare in quality to Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings. They dropped the ball on this one.
4,Better that Volume 1,"It felt like this Volume 2 had more substance to it than compared to volume 1. I enjoyed watching it, and I think they put a bit more effort into the graphics and special effects, compared to the first volume, overall something worthwhile to watch."
5,gingerAZ,This DVD goes into much detail in the symbols in the capital building and other monuments in the DC area. It shows the controversy of different opinions of the planning of the street layouts. It poses a question if America was established as a Christian nation then why is there so much pagan imagery in the architecture. The imagery is explained according to the thinking of the founding Fathers.
4,Awesome voice,"I have to say, if it wasn't for Jessie's voice, I would probably give this album three stars. The music in itself is nothing amazing (except for a few tunes like Riverwide and Monkey), but Jessie's voice is what makes this band. She's just got something that I can't really explain. I really like this album, but sometimes I'm just wishing they would get a little funkier. They got everything they need to go there, but other than a few moments on a few songs, they really don't go there. I think they have the potential in the future to get a little harder edge, so I'll be watching them."
1,Romanov's Russian/English dictionary,"I guess that I should have asked for details before ordering the dictionary; probably, the Russian name of the author should have made me reflect, but it did not. My problem with the dictionary is that I am not familiar with the cyrillic alphabet and could therefore not use it. It would be helpful if that were specified."
1,No good,"I bought Romanov's Dictionary because of many possitive comments has been posted in amazon.com about this Dicitonary, there's no avialable in bookstore in my area , I had to make special order. After I openned it and found disappointment, it has the blurry typeface and fonts that makes all the Cyrillic letters very hard to distinguish. For the same price I would recommend Collins Gem Russian Dictionary; ISBN: 0007143044 instead."
3,"Truth, or at least care, in advertising.","I have not bought or seen the book, but only stumbled upon the item on the website. What drew my attention to it was the author's name as given in the ad: ""Pomahova"".The imbecile who wrote this looked at the dust cover, where the name ""Romanova"" is printed in Cyrillic characters that fortuitously resemble Latin characters: ""POMAHOBA"", and pretended that they were already Latin letters, thus ""Pomahoba"".The mind simply boggles. Keep up the good work, Amazon. And for lunch today, go out to a good neighborhood PECTOPAH to celebrate."
2,Typeface of dictionary is nearly impossible to read.,"An inexpensive dictionary alternative, Romanov's Dictionary has proved to be extremely unreliable in my experience. For newcomers to the Russian language, the blurry typeface make all the new Cyrillic letters hard to distinguish. Also, I personally have been informed by my native speaking Russian professor, many of the words I have sought in Romanov's have been incorrect."
1,Blurry print. Unreadable,And that was before I wore reading glasses.It looks like they use an old Soviet typeface.I still have mine but will probably throw it away.
2,Not my favorite Heep album.,"Like many of their albums, this one is a mixed bag. ""Lady in Black"" and ""The Park"" are both great, haunting tracks that rank among Heep's best. The rest I can take or leave. Songs like ""High Priestess"" are okay, I guess, but nothing really special. The title track is IMHO a big mistake from beginning to end. This one is recommended for hard-core Heep fans only.The UK version of Salisbury, by the way, includes ""Bird of Prey"", which is one of my 3 or so favorite Heep tracks of all time. It does not appear on the US version of this album."
2,not all that great,"in many respects,a debut album to me.nothing remotely in common with uriah heep and look at yourself.only saving graces are""time to live"" and""simon the bullet freak"".the rest,a psychodelic prog-rock 60's nightmare.makes me wished they never even made this album.only buy it if you are a completist."
5,Sensitive music,"There were 2 magical albums in the summer 1970 of the new heavy and mellow sound in Germany: ""Deep Purple in Rock"" and ""Salisbury"". Many youngsters got access to the new brigdege of the link of the Hitparade and Groups like Yes and Emerson Lake & Palmer. Uriah Heep was the bridge. It was a wonderful time. Everything seemed to be young and fresh, innocent and new. Typically for the german taste of music: Mellow, sweet, malancholically ballads and hard tunes both. When we were 12. we felt ourselves newborn Progressives with this album in school, now I am 40 and I love this album still. The title track is very sensitive and sad music of a broken love. This is no haeavy rock, its an own style.I love it, my first record for Christmas. The European Cover was better, but not suitable as the american. Better would have been some drawings like ""Demons and Wizards"". It reminds me of old times and impressive sound for innocent ears. Kind regards."
1,DON'T get this version - get the import,"without 'bird of prey', salisbury is like tarzan without the loin-cloth!'bird of prey' is to uriah heep, what 'child in time' is to deep purple or 'immigrant song' is to led zeppelin. ie nobody else could have done the song but david byron.get the import version. it opens up with 'bird of prey'."
2,Joan Crawford was ashamed of this film,"There are so many good Crawford titles yet to be released on DVD that you have to wonder why they are releasing this trash which Crawford herself hated. She said that if she was ever to suffer for her past sins, this is the movie that would be shown to her over and over again. She also found John Wayne to be miscast.Also to be released on DVD around the same time as ""Reunion in France"" is another of Crawford's worst films ""Trog"". Seriously, who decides these releases? What fans want most of all are the unreleased Crawford classics such as ""Story of Esther Costello"", ""A Woman's Face', ""Strange Cargo"" and ""Susan and God"". Besides the DVD releases of ""Baby Jane"", ""Grand Hotel"" and ""Mildred Pierce"" some years back, the DVD releases for Crawford so far have been dismal and look set to continue.Warner Bros and MGM take note: please release the better films from Crawford's catalogue and stop wasting time with films like ""Reunion in France"" and ""Trog""."
2,Wartime Propaganda movie with stars,"This is a wartime movie with a main purpose of advancing the wartime effort. John Wayne plays a rather minor supporting role in this film which is rather transparent. You can solve the mystery early on. But it was done for a purpose and during wartime. Taken for what it was, it's not a bad flick but the expectations then and now are quite different as they should be. In context, a not a bad movie."
3,Wayne and Crawford in wartorn France,"Glossy, entertaining WWII era propaganda and the only time John Wayne and Joan Crawford appeared together in the same film. Not as good as CASABLANCA or MRS. MINIVER but still a must see for fans of films made about the war between the years 1939 and 1945. Keep an eye out for Natalie Schafer (""Mrs. Howell"" from GILLIGAN'S ISLAND) as a pushy Nazi officer's wife and Ava Gardner as a salesgirl who says ""Gutentag""."
3,Joan in drips and drabs,"WHY are we getting Joan Crawford DVDs in drips and drabs? Not only few and far between but SCHLOCK! WHO do we have to give back rubs to in order to get the good stuff? Flamingo Road, Torch Song, Autumn Leaves, Female on the Beach, Susan and God, Strange Cargo, When Ladies Meet...I could go on. I simply do not understand the poor mistreatment of Miss Crawford. Is Christina in charge of the releases?? THAT might explain TROG being released before MUCH better fare. Also, I am tired of all the teasing on Amazon about Johnny Guitar. They must have 4 different DVDs pictured and yet NONE are available. TEASES! lol I DO hope the Powers That Be come to their senses about Miss Crawfords DVD releases.Oh, and this DVD isn't my fave but Joan LOOKS wonderful in it. She simply HATED this film but it is a fun way to pass a rainy sunday afternoon."
3,Reunion In France,"Reunion in FranceThe MovieBasically it's the occupation of France with John Wayne in it. It on par with his B pictures it's not very well paced nor is it very interesting to watch. I personally think this may have been and attempt to squash the dukes guilt at not being able to serve in WWII. He is the only bright spot on this horrible movie.The VideoIn need of a restoration, it has some grain issues and focus problems. It is in black and white full frame and shows its age.The Audio1.0 mono no extra treatment hereThe ExtrasWe Do It BecauseA look at the customs of manners and there origins they came from. This feature is actually better than the movie.War DogsHere a cartoon about dogs in boot camp and there training just a propaganda film for our side I had not seen this one before but did enjoy it."
4,Best fiction horse book I've read,Scarlet Royal is so much better than any of the series out there. This book actually has *life* to it. Very good read for anyone who loves horses.
1,THE MOVIE DESCRIPTION ON AMAZON'S PAGE IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THIS MOVIE,"Viewing this tenuous, torpid, tedious and talky film was like living one of those nightmares where one runs and runs and gets nowhere. Perhaps the dullest movie ever made supposedly involving sex.Or maybe involving anything. Certainly the very least-engaging, unenjoyable movie I've ever seen. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
5,"Not a comedy, just another masterpiece from the great Catherine....","Catherine Breillat is one of the greatest filmmakers working today. Her films are extraordinarily accurate in their depiction of the war between the sexes. Too often people are terrified of her work (both the public and the critics), because it's so truthful. This film is a companion piece to her masterpiece Fat Girl, in that it is a depiction of the making of the scene where the older sister ends up having sex with a local suitor. It is not a comedy, it is a Catherine Brelliat film. Many people rent this film thinking it's going to be fun. It's a great film, and it's not frivilous. If you admire Breillat (which you should), you should rent this. If you hate her, stay away, and it's your loss..."
2,Oh la la - Quel desastre!,"I bought this movie to catch up on Gregoire Colin's antics - to see how he'd graduated from Olivier Olivier and Beau Travail for example. Although there was nothing wrong with his performance, I felt that the script was so lamentable and so laboured that there was no way I would recommend this jejeune movie to anyone without jeopardising the friendship. It is just wet! Praise the Lord it is available at a Loss Leader price, otherwise I would be liable to self flagellate with a plastic appendage. Catherine, what were you thinking?"
1,Travelpro Briefcase,"Charge has hit credit card, but still have not received product as they are on backorder. Very dis-satisfied by the lack of communication between Amazon and Luggage Source provider. Customer should not be charged until product has been shipped."
3,Dated Prose,"Set in the hills of Piedmont, Pavese's fine novel casts his characters in a summer of existentialized rumination. A group of young friends spend their time idling in vacuous thought--until they meet Poli, a somewhat mysterious and rich figure who shares an open marriage with Gabriella and uses cocaine. As a result of the somewhat dated existential content of the dialogue, Pavese's novel fails to develop. Although there are many passages here and a dark, sonorous voice, the text has become rather stale."
1,Christian Book...NOT a Celtic Pagan book,I agree with Kaell'n Wolfsong's review. This book is misleading in its title and subtitle. It speaks about the Celtic people but really bashes Pagan traditions and glorifies christian conversion. This book is horrible.
3,"good product , service sucks !!!","I received what I thought was the previous foundation I ordered in the pass , but it wasn't the accurate one. They sent me a bronzer. later I find out the original foundation was taken off the market and the item # was given to a different product( a bronzer ) but they never mentioned it. I made the seller aware, she apologized and said she would send the original, It never happened !!! I'M STILL WAITING !! And they still have it listed with the same stock number and name, "" Dual Powder Foundation "" knowing very well that it's notwhat comes in the mail."
5,Pinky and the brain pretty much best ever,Pinky and the brain is all laughs and smiles. Having a bad day? Pop in this and you just might turn your day around. Two mice trying to prove their mousy worth and take over the world? Who wouldn't love this?
2,Why bother?,"Hello Dolly is a dumb show. It is inane, frothy, and utterly empty; nonetheless, the score is catchy, and if you're really in need of some suffocatingly sweet tunes, its a good go. I am not totally averse to frothiness. This recording, however, is not the best representation of this score (which has been recorded quite a few times.) Streisand may have a great belter's voice, but she is totally wrong for this part; she is way WAY too young. The other women in the cast make no impression whatsoever. Michael Crawford sounds like he's about twelve; i have never been a fan of his nasal, forced voice anyway. Matthau is the only one who does good by the material; unfortunately, his big song early on, It Takes A Woman, suffers because it is essentially the same as the more well-known We Need a Little Christmas from Mame, and this is a big distraction. Dont bother with this CD; watch the movie if only for its truly amazing production design (and Louis Armstrong's 30 second cameo.)"
3,"This is a wonderful cd, but...","This is a great album. Barbra Striesand, Walter Matthau, and Michael Crawford are all wonderful, but there wonderful songs that are missing. In addition to that the songs that are there are missing whole verses. This cd also doesn't capture the whole spirit of the show (believe me I just did this show). If you are looking for a great recording try one of the two Carol Channing ones. I don't really like her voice, but she is the best Dolly there has been."
3,Works better as an album than as a movie!,"Didn't care for the film, with Streisand battling stuffy Walter Matthau for the spotlight, but the soundtrack is everything the movie was not: pert, perky, bubbly, sensual, humorous and grand. ""Just Leave Everything To Me"" is a perfect vehicle for Streisand's rapid-fire delivery and ""Before The Parade Passes By"" is amazing(Barbra re-recorded this song for 45 single release--a shorter, more ""pop"" version, and it's terrible; stick with this version). ""So Long Dearie"" is another Streisand triumph, one of those lost Streisand numbers that never pops up on any of her ""best of"" packages. I think some of this music suits her better than the pop songs she was doing on her solo outings. B+"
1,YOU HAVE THE WRONG SONGS FOR PURCHASE,"What is going on here? This page is for the movie soundtrack, not the Broadway version with Mary Martin (even though I love Mary Martin). The songs to download for purchase on this page are NOT sung by Barbra Streisand or Michael Crawford. Are the individual songs from the soundtrack a available for purchase and download? If so, why aren't they on THIS page?"
1,what are the names of ALL songs in the album?,"It would be nice to be able to find a listing of the songs other than ""Hello Dolly"" which are in the ablum. :("
3,Fox needs to reissue this CD,"There are very few soundtrack Cds from this period that haven't had a makeover (even ""Goodbye Mr Chips"" which has yet to be released on DVD)This CD is only the LP version cleaned up and transferred, leaving so much of the lavish music which can be heard in the film, on the cutting room floor. You will wonder at the end of ""Just leave Everything to Me"" where is the sparkling overture we are so used to in the film? You wont hear it here, nor the full dance segments from ""Dancing"", nor the Waiter's Gallop AT ALL. Can someone please shake up Fox and get them to release a restored and complete version of this classic score?"
4,Buying this for my 6 year old son,I am buying this cd for my 6 year old son. He heard this soundtrack in the movie WALL-E and immediately fell in love with it. I had heard the soundtrack many times and have seen the movie but did not realize that Michael Crawford was in it. Can't wait to receive the cd. Patty R CT
4,the movie version,i'm preparing to audition for a local production of Hell o Dolly and bought the CD to get musical inspiration. I like that Streisand's Dolly is younger than some of the others who played the roll.
2,Lasted just over a year,"I have had this model for just over a year and it spontaneously died. This is the second rice maker to die after a short time, so the failure is the reason for 2 stars. While it WAS working, it cooked rice just fine. Ours came with a veggie steamer which worked well, just remember to put a little less water for the rice if you make rice along side it as the veggies will add water to the rice.Aside from the failure this was a good rice maker, if it hadn't failed I'd have rated it 4 stars, because sometimes the cooker would switch spontaneously to warm mode before finishing cooking the rice."
1,Don't waste your money on this flimsy rice cooker!,"After three months of use, this rice cooker stopped working. The problem was that it would stop cooking, even though the rice wasn't close to being done. I called the service number and they sent me a new one (for which I had to pay $6 for shipping). I used it once and it worked fine, but it stopped working the second time I tried to use it. I will never buy this brand of rice cooker again."
2,What happened?,"I bought this approx. 6 months ago. When I got it, it worked alright. We used it almost everynight, which is why i give it 2 stars.I moved and didn't use it for about a month. When i pulled it out of the cupboard to use it for dinner, it had stopped working. It would shut off as soon as I would turn it on. I don't know what happened. Now its in the dumpster.I would not recommend getting this product. Unless it is just for a short period of time."
5,Poor man's answer for protecting his Rights.,"""Super Threats"" is the poor man's answer to fighting back. When I first heard about this book I had just lost some money to some one promising me they could get me a homr equity loan. But I had to put some money up front to ""process"" the paper work. After getting this book and reading it I decided to launch my own ""Super Threat"" to try and see if I could get all or part of my money back. Following the books instructions to the letter I sent a letter in the format outlined in the book. I even went out and got the ""Certified Mail"" stamps with the certified number so I could put that number in my letter. One of the tips in the book. Within four days I not only got my all my money back, I got a great letter of apolagy from the CEO of the company. Need I say more?"
2,ugh disappointed,"One thing i do love about the bra is that it has great side support but thats it. the lace in front is bulky and shows through most shirts, it also gives the 'torpedo' effect. Worse of all its a 'final sale item' and you can't return it. Idk when i'll wear it. Maybe in winter under a very thick sweater"
5,Firm and Sexy,"Absolutely superb panty. The microfiber front panel is smooth, silky, and has a bit of tummy control to it. The lace stretches to fit one's bottom, actually provides a certain amount of lift, and stays in place all day long. While providing full coverage, it still is extremely sexy. The panty does not bind or pinch and moves with you for all day comfort and support. These panties are my little sexy secret at work."
3,OK,"It works but there really isn't enough power to suck much up, i had to take parts off to make it work."
3,"a mystery, not!","this is a panegyric to liberal catholicism wrapped inside a supposed mystery novel. rather than playing means, opportunity and motive, we have a rehash of the culture wars within the us catholic church since the mid-1960's. the white hats are the liberals, the guys in black (not all priests) are the more orthodox folks.while an interesting tour if you are a liberal catholic, a tremendous disappointment if you were expecting a mystery novel."
2,I was disappointed,"This novel is the first William X. Kienzle book I have read in about 7 years and I could wait another 7 years if future books will be like this one. The beginning is very well written and gets you prepared for a wonderful story, but then the body of the novel slows to a crawl with more talk of Church teaching than actual mystery. This book started promising then went down hill, even the ending was a little boring. The earlier books are much better."
4,Much better than that other album!,"Better Than Ezra made a much, much better album with Friction Baby than the previous one. The lead singer sounds very good and the band just is dynamic on all the songs. Desperately Wanting, King of New Orleans and numerous other songs are winners here. Considering that Don Gehman was a hot producer between 1994 and 1996 with Hootie and the Blowfish, he produced a very fine effort for BTE. They deserve kudos for making this effort and showing their artistic growth as a band."
3,Some songs are great...some not,"Well, this is a CD which is average in all meanings. The melodies and lyrics are okay, but somehow theres something missing. The very special thing that makes you say ""I love this album"".""King of New Orleans"" is a good opener...but after that there isnt much happening.The main reason why you should buy the album is ""WWOZ"", the (only real) highlight on ""Friction, Baby""."
5,Refreshing/Addictive,"After listening to ""How Does your Garden Grow"" & ""Deluxe"", I keep coming back to ""Friction Baby"". I also bought the CD for Desperately Wanting & King of New Orleans, but absolutely love WWOZ (and many others), the songs create a sensory image. Each is unique; rough but polished, perdictible, yet not. Not only are the lyrics espcially compelling, the music itself remains in memory.""Deluxe"" seems like an amatuer effort in comparison to ""Friction"". Although there are many good efforts on ""Deluxe"". In my opinion ""Friction"" can hold its own against the best.""How Does Your Garden Grow"" seems to be too much of a departure from ""Friction"" and doesn't have the 'mesh' to bind it together as a whole like ""Friction"". Lacking the soul of ""Friction"" and more of an experiment in which direction to go; unfortunately not arriving at the destination."
4,A fresh and insightful reading of major modern thinkers.,"Elshtain rocks. A tremendous writer whose acute philosophical sensibilities she combines with her interest in gender and moral discourse to reveal sophisticated and poignant prose on modern thought. Thinkers examined include: Luther, Weil, Jane Addams, Hegel, Freud, Machiavelli, Kant, and Arendt."
5,Understanding your limits,"This is a scholarly work which is accessible to lay readers while informative to trained physiologists. The language is polished, well edited and communicates easily. The chapter length is convenient to a 20-30 minute session making this rather slender volume very enjoyable to read as pleasure. Its well documented material makes it wonderfully informative. Many excellent reports of heroic and sometimes tragic outcomes of man's intrepid adventures. The topics cover everything from the ocean depths (pressure and cold) to deserts to outer space. A great read."
4,Too Cute!,"my son loves this phone! only thing i would change about it would be the cord.. i would prefer a curly plastic, slightly longer cord, aswell as the hand held to look like an actual phone. but it works great overall. He did loose the phone's ""hand held"" piece because it detaches very easily."
4,pretty good album blows my mind,"This is simply the sexiest music Doug Pinnick has ever made. Pinnick's work with King's X has always been highly praised as being soulful and powerful but the last thing anybody could say was that the music was sexy. With Pinappleskunk we still get Pinnick's trademark bass and vocals but delivered with more sophistication, self assurance, and joy than in any of his previous work. Potency like this could carry the band for another twenty years."
3,Dug's second effort takes some growing,"Growing on you that is. He's always pushed in experimenting, and some of these, didn't really work well for me. However, there are some gems on here that are all Dug for sure. I thought that if he would have added some vocals (with other singers) to his own voice it may have made the audio texture a bit more rich and exciting. Jerry G. didn't sing at all on this, even though he drums the whole thing, and he's one third of the great harmony of King's X. But, I guess sometimes it's all about Dug."
2,"Stick to playing bass, Doug.","After semi-enjoying the detuned slow tunes on Doug Pinnick's first Poundhound effort,I took a chance on the second offering.This is more of the same only worse.Doug should hire a guitar player,try a different drummer and try writing some upbeat stuff even if still in ""detuned mode"".I love King's X.I have all of their CD's and have been following them for six years.I will,however,not buy any more Poundhound...."
2,Very disappointing followup,"I really loved the first Poundhound album, and I'm about to put this one on e Bay already. My main problem is with the vocals. Most of the songs here have good choruses, but the distorted/half-spoken vocals on the verses get old after about one song. Sing, darnit, you have a great voice. I do not want to hear you talk. Track # 5 is a great song though. Waiting for the next King's X album now."
4,Rice Cakes,"Could be 35 calories instead of 40 like the Quakers brand, but it's a good buy from Amazon. One order lasts a long time!"
2,2 1/2 stars worked just really cheap,it worked but is just cheap. bearings are not the best you can feel it when u spin it but for the price it worked fine
2,"Important subject, but the book does not quite match",This is a very important subject but I felt the book did not quite come to terms with it. I had no real sense of how Pastors should approach these soldiers so deeply wounded.
2,Wah wah wah,"Found the main character very annoying--unlike Ferris in ""Ferris Buellers Day Off,"" the narration by the lead found me liking him less and less."
5,Tub Safety Bar to the Rescue!,My mom is getting to that age where she wanted some extra security and support when using the tub and shower and this safety bar fills the bill. It is very sturdy and well made and super easy to install or adjust. She loves it!
3,Tube Safety Bar,I was unable to use this particular item because the bar did not fit over the top of the side of my bathtub which is curved. The review required I rate the item so my rating is arbitrary since I didn't use it. I will say Amazon's return policy is great and I give it five stars.
5,Tub Safety Rail,"I recently purchased this item for my 86 year old mother and then again for my 84 year old uncle. I tested the bar, once I put it on the tub, and found it to be very, very supportive. My Mom loves getting a bath again because she can get in and out with ease."
5,Got this for my 80 yr old grandma,I feel better knowing she can get in and out of the tub safer...came very fart and was easy to install
5,Amazing!!,"Worth the money especially for an elderly person..My grandma; 80 yrs old, absolutely loves it.. before the grip she would shower herself, and would literally grab onto the wall to get out the bathtub, which is a scary thing!!!!"
4,Adaptive Design meets Mother-in-law's Expectations,"After extensive research the Moen DN7005 was purchased for mother-in-law who had specific expectations in a safety bar. The design is adaptive to mount anywhere on the tub and can be switched around in either direction for shower or bath use. The clamping design as well as the textured grips gives extra security rather than the suction design of many other products.Assembly was a little difficult and tedious but this was the downside of having such a flexible, adaptive design. Not sure if this safety bar would support the weight of a heavy person.Mother-in-law is happy."
2,Not Up to Par,"I thought a product made by Moen would be top quality, but this Safety Bar is not. It seems to grip the tub side securely enough, but the bar itself wobbles when you grab hold of it. A wobbly bar is almost worse than no bar at all."
4,I just finished reading Paris 1919,"[...]My father had graduated from Law School before enlisting in the Army Air Corps. He told us that his transport ship arrived in Le Havre three days after the Armistice, but he also told us that he got to ""march through Paris with ""cornstalks"" (which might have been apocryphal). I just finished reading Paris 1919 by Margaret MacMillan (six months that changed the World -- the three top hats, Wilson, George, and Clemenceau, the ""lasting peace"", and the birth of Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Palestine)."
5,History woven with personalities and culture,"What an incredibly powerful point in history. The ending of an era of dynasties lasting centuries and monarchy for several countries along with the evolution of communism. The personalities of the leaders and how they related in the process is fascinating. The process of breaking up the Austrian-Hungary empire as well as the Ottoman empire and the ramifications resulting are worth the read.I enjoyed the cultural differences outlined between the French, English, American and Italian as well, not to mention the German, Japanese, Chinese, Greek and others. The evolution of America and the American position on foreign affairs is also worthy of note.There is much complex material and much history of the areas in question but I recommend this book highly."
4,Great insight.,"I bought this book to better understand some of the historical events that happened during the earlier years of our century. This book describes in great detail how our leaders of the time changed history for better or for worse. depends on your point of view. The author described in detail every leaders character, background and decision process during that time period. The author has a fluid style enabling the reader to follow her thoughts and perceptions, then tie them into the overall environment.I would recommend this book to all readers trying to understand our current status by looking back in a detailed past."
5,Brilliant book,just wish she had carried on and explained why the British Govt. didn't support the Hasemites against the Saud's in the civil war in Arabia in the 20's
2,A poor narrative,"A bit unconnected and fleshless account of the Peace Conference, it tries to cover the whole array of negotiatinos and peace treaties leaving a rather superficial taste. It may be good for an introduction to the topic but it is definitely not a deep analysis or a main source."
4,Real history need not be dull,"A wonderful book, proving that 'real' history with exaustive research need not be dull or focus on minor issues of little interest to the general reader. The author is a great granddaughter of Lloyd George, but it is not biased in any significant way. Interesting portraits of the people and countries involved. While you may not agree with the analysis, you will find it both engaging and well researched by a professional historian. Oxford has done it again, why can't our American Uni's teach historians to write??"
3,Books should be made to last...,"This was a very comprehensive and well-researched book, far superior to anything I have read on the topic. It is well organized and very readable, filled with facts and wonderful anecdotes.However, I paid full retail for this book, brand new off the shelf, and the book fell apart in my hands on the first reading! I know how to take care of a book, and when a book cannot endure a single reading without the binding coming apart, I can only conclude that the publisher has lost control of its manufacturing process.I offer my kudos to Ms. MacMillan for her fine work. Shame on Random House for such shoddy manufacturing and quality control."
3,A must read...,"... but not as good as other great history books. Still, I would recommend people to read the book to get some perspective on what happened in those six months. What went wrong and what some of the reasons are. If you are looking for perspective, this book will give you some of that. I didn't think it was as well written as some of Robert K Massie's books (Dreadnought is a much better read for example).If you are interested in multiple perspectives about WWI I would recommend to read the following:1) Dreadnought - Robert K. Massie2) Guns of August - Barbara Tuchman (excellent in itself)3) Paris 1919 (as reviewed above)These three books will give you the lead-in to the war, the early days of the actual war (and why the Germans failed) and some perspective on the aftermath..."
5,A Change in History's Judgement,"The Big Three deserve a revised judgment from historians. When you consider the state of the world in 1919 and the conflicting pressures between expectations and realities, the decisions made then which are still reverberating around us today were the best that could be made by fallible human beings. Rather than decry the results of the Versailles Conference and the peacemakers' attempts to make a better world, it would be more fitting to criticize the next generation (or what was left of it) which failed to pursue what the peacemakers had envisioned."
3,PARIS 1919,"Too many names and dates and very light analisis.However, it gives you a reasonable view of what happened at the end of the war"
4,tedious at times,"A very good and thorough history lesson, but it does get tedious and repetitive. I learned more though about that period in American history (and indeed world history) than I ever knew before. Just when I thought the world leaders actually knew what they were doing, you find out that they were basically winging it."
1,Couldn't get past page 12,"The tone of the writing in this book is like a middle school girls' cliquey catfight. I thought I could stomach that at least for a few chapters, but page 12 has this rant which can be summarized as: Wilson failed to determine what the perfect ultimate form of government should be, was hiding in his cabin (when he was not out taking walks, arm and arm with Mrs. Wilson (not one of the ""lesser wives"" you know)), failed to tell his advisors what this ultimate perfect form of government should be, and more horrific than that used lofty words in his speeches that made people sad and disappointed later.I was glad to leave middle school. Didn't feel like returning for the hundreds of pages of this it would take to read this book. If it gets better later, let me know what chapter."
1,"Superficial, overblown and biased account","...P>This is fashionable history seen through the prism of personalities, the `great man' approach to history. No wonder that Blair, we are told, liked this book!"
4,Good for my purpose,"Okay I had no interest in reading this book at first. I read Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto for a world governments course that I am currently enrolled in for college. I really don't agree with many of the opinions voiced in either book, but I take them at face value. Weather you agree with Hitler or not he was able to control the masses. My purpose for reading the book was to understand the man. The ""method to the madness"" if you will. Reading this book helped me to understand where he was comming from with some of his ideals. I don't agree with him, but atleast now I understand it. There's really no since in bashing something you know nothing about. I'm not saying that you should follow the ""teachings"" in this book. I'm only saying that you need to know what you are talking about if you are gonna bash something."
3,Mein Kampf Official Nazi Translation,"Unless you are a hard-core student of history, this translation isn't really necessary. It is incomplete and the original translator didn't even finish it, since he fled Germany before it was finished (he was English). There are a lot of inaccuracies built in to the translation. If you read a Mein Kampf, a Translation Controversy, you will get the gist of the errors in this one. For that reason, Mein Kampf, a Translation Controversy should have been fleshed out more to include more examples (as I stated in my review of that one)."
2,"For comparisons only, not for those interested in the book itself","I bought this book in hopes of reading what Hitler's motives were. However, this book is incredibly hard to read. Not only are there grammar mistakes but also many punctuation mishaps which make this book almost entirely unreadable. I don't suggest this book to anyone unless you are only wishing to know the difference between this and one of the other versions available."
3,Book,This book anticipates in great detail the sickness within this man. He foretells what he will do and does when in power. Very sobering to say the least.
1,Kindle Fire edition,Has anybody actually got this on Kindle fire? Every time I click the Kindle like it takes me to a 1939 photo book. That's not the one I want... Just curious to see if anybody has gotten it or is it marked wrong.
3,Only Worth Reading for the Chapter on Propaganda,"I put my ego aside and read this book, it started out interesting and I was intrigued by Part 1. But Part 2 put me to sleep and I felt like Hitler was just rambling from there on out. The only chapter that I think is great, is chapter 6 about propaganda. A lot of the principles he lays out in that chapter can be seen in society today, everywhere from marketing, politics and even business. Probably his best contribution to society."
2,Publisher's Thoughts Reflected,"I just began reading this book, and immediately, I picked up lots of typos in just 2 pages:Among, spelled ""Amnng"" (I mistook this typo for a name and had the re-read the sentence several times to figure it out)the name, spelled ""thename""execution was, spelled ""executionwas""as a, spelled ""asa""him on, spelled ""himon""Perhaps this carelessness reflects the publisher's disrespect toward the author?Now, These typos all appear in the publisher's add-on background information, which is made to help us understand Mein Kampf better. But still, I expect better works from a $3 buy. And although I'm not a big fan of Hitler, I do expect a historical document to be exact and mistake-free. That expectation is completely extinguished by these typos."
3,Important historical document,"Many people would like to ban this book, Germany has already done it. Personally I think that banning words is the worst way of dealing with history. People need to read, they need to learn how to think: and one shuld prevent a book's attraction to rise, which does seem to happen, just as result of banning it in the first place.Read this book, take it as a historic document, build your own opinion. There is no good and evil in ths world, but there are prejudices and ways that lead to distruction of parts of humanity, which can only be a loss. Looking back into history, we know what this book has caused. In order to prevent such a history from happening again, we all need to read this book in to recognize a similar handwriting in our future."
2,Wow worse than I thought it would be,"I didn't think I would be reading something as enjoyable as say Mark Twain or Ernest Hemingway but I couldn't get through the first two pages of this thing before I had to put it down. It was so choppy and misplaced and required so much attention on my part (probably more than I am willing to give this book), when I looked to see it was something like 800 pages I couldn't imagine putting in the required effort to reading this book. You read this book if you have to (maybe a research project or something) not because you want to. I thought I would be getting a real good snapshot into Hitler's mind, which you probably will, but you might as well watch a documentary on him and get the same information in one or two hours that it would take to read this entire book."
4,Nazi,"This is a book that has an historical value, first of all of what it represent. And second you can know all the efforts of Nazis to make people know his theories."
4,Up and Down,"Although some parts of this work contain interesting pieces about Hitler's life and moral conduct, it's mostly filled with boring, watered-down political ideologies."
2,In A Literary Sense It's Junk,"Hitler, although extremely evil, was possibly one of the best orators of all time. He could move crowds like no one else with his powerful speeches and yet virtually nothing he said is still quoted today. Why? Because it was not what Hitler said, but rather how he said it. Do not buy Mein Kampf if you want an entertaining, well written read; rather buy this book for its historical significance. Were this book written by some other unknown man the ramblings about racial purity and Jews as parasitic sub humans would enthrall very few and put most to sleep. However for those interested in how Hitler's mind worked there can be no better direct example than his book, but in literary quality two stars is very generous."
4,Great book,I ordered this for my brother and he was very pleased. I recommend it for any historian. Priced very reasonably.
2,None,OMG! WHAT FREAK! THIS WAS THE ANSWER TO TO DEMOCRACY! MASSES RALLIED TO THIS TRIPE! MEIN KAMPF ! IN DEED! TO READ IT! BRILLIANT MIND! GAGGING! REPLACE THE 80 YEARS OF TREES OWED FOR REPRINTIG!
2,Even the Publisher Thinks This a Poor Translation,"Michael Ford, who self-publishes this under his ""Elite Minds"" logo, writes the following about this translation in his ""Mein Kampf: A Translation Controversy"":This version ""had many gross misspellings, punctuation errors, and grammar errors. Apparently, an English speaking Nazi Party member took James Murphy's unpolished translation and tried to finish it. The result is very poor and this may be part of the reason it was not more widely distributed.""If one is really interested in ""Mein Kampf,"" this translation may be of marginal interest. However, since it never had significant distribution, and since in the publisher's own words the translation is poor, why would the average person interested in what Hitler had to say buy this translation? Go with Ralph Manheim's translation, the one most scholars use."
3,Could it happen again?,"Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler is a horrible but absolutely necessary read. We need to teach this evil theory to our young people so that they can see what can happen if good people stand aside because the actions of a demagogue don't affect their day-to-day life. Take the word Jew and insert Irish, French, Italian or Muslim and see how easily Hitler's beliefs can be used to justify in the minds of some the heinous treatment of others. Lest we forget."
4,Great,The delivery was prompt and the price was just right. The translation is gets a little weird with all the punctuation but other than that it's a great purchase.
4,Hitler and current events,"What prompted me to read Mein Kampf by Adolf Hiller was the reading of ""They Came in Peace by Ann Watson. And Rules For Radicals by Sal Alinsky, which was brought to my attention by Dreams from my Father by Barack Obama."
1,Disappointed,"2x TEKTON 19558 1-3/16-Inch Jumbo Combination WrenchSold by Boston Industrial Inc. (Boston Industrial)Condition: newI received the wrenches today, which was good as it was ahead of the anticipated delivery date. However, I did not receive what I ordered and paid for.I received wrenches (which were the correct size) made by a company called Valley.I would like to know why I did not get what I ordered. I have emailed the company but have not received a response. At, this point I say.... steer clear it's a rip off."
2,I say NO...,"Hard to believe this cd is sandwiched in between British Steel and Screaming for Vengeance. In the liner notes it reveals this album was written mostly in the studio... and it shows. Many of the songs, at least half, seem half-hearted and shallow. It's pretty clear that the band didn't live with these songs enough to make them ""special"". Tracks, 7, 8, 9, 10 are ALL totally forgettable.Still, like many things Priest it's pretty much a necessity at any rate. Solar Angels being my fave with Desert Plains being right behind.The ""bonus track"" is poorly produced and has low sound quality, add to that a forgettable rendition of Desert Plains and you have two extras right out the window. If your looking for the best of what IS JP, try British Steel, or my favorite Sin After Sin. Buy Point of Entry ONLY after all other cd's have been exhausted and even then... tread lightly."
2,"Priest ""pops"" all night and parties every day","This is probably what happens when you're trying to make a record in ""Party Paradise"" Ibiza. In the sleeve notes the group talk about their alcohol abuse and other excesses during their stay on the island and this record is the result of what was going on at that time. The music is simple, straightforward, poppy and pretty uninspired. No duelling guitars, no tempo changes, no surprises. Apart from Solar Angels, Desert Plains and Heading out to the highway this album hasn't got a lot to offer. The band took a holiday ..."
2,the worst album by Judas Priest,"I think there are lots of weak songs on this album, that's why I give his album 2 stars. I like Judas Priest very much, but this album is the album that I never listen because this kinda sucks. Believe me, I have tried to get into this album, but it jsut didn't work. I hope that this review is helpful to you."
2,What the hell?,"I bought this album knowing of only Heading out to the Highway which is a very kool song. When I listned to the whole album I was not too happy. Desert Plains,Solar Angels and Heading Out To The Highway are the only 3 I like on this album. JP were criticized more for TURBO than POINT OF ENTRY. I find TURBO to be better than POINT OF ENTRY. It sounds like JP didnt work very hard on this album. While the 3 songs I mentioned are very good I just don't care for the remaining songs."
4,The point of entry case,"This is not the best JP album neither the worst. It contains great tracks as ""Desert Plains"" but contains mediocre tracks as ""You say yes"" too. The first 5 tracks are excellent but the remainder of the cd is not worth much.If you are a Priest fan buy it! If you aren't, I recommend you British Steel!"
2,Priest Goes Pop,"Here's all you need to know about the albums Judas Priest put out in the 1980's: Half of the them were good or great, and half of them were pretty bad. POINT OF ENTRY falls into the latter category.Following the enormous success of the hard-hitting BRITISH STEEL album, Priest decided to try to capitalize on the American market by going in a more commercial direction with the follow-up. The result is a collection of mostly forgetable songs. There are three good songs here: ""Heading Out To The Highway,"" ""Hot Rockin'"" & ""Desert Plains."" The instrumental intro to ""Solar Angels"" is pretty cool also.Simply put, this is an album that was made more for pop music fans as opposed to metalheads. Just look at the album cover!!!! It doesn't exactly scream ""Metal"" now does it? If you need further proof, just look at the track listings on the live albums Priest have put out since the early 1980's. How many songs from POINT OF ENTRY do you see?"
4,"JP Go AOR, and I Like It...","Someone once called this album the Load (by Metallica) of the 1980s. In other words, where the ultimate metal band of that particular generation decided to sell out. This is not true. Point of Entry is a fine album, just not one of Priest' absolute best. They decide to keep all the songs here short and sweet and not as heavy, thus more radio (AOR) oriented, but you'll never confuse them with Journey or REO Speedwagon. More like AC/DC, I dare say. ""On The Run"" features some awesome vocals and a driving beat...in fact, it's funny I say ""driving."" This is one of my favorite CD's to drive to and from work to. Yes, at times all the songs sound alike and as far as subject matter, every song seems to be about either riding your Harley through the desert or kinky sex, but so what? It's not PC alternative stuff. Enjoy."
3,Only for die-hard fans or pop-metal fans,"One of Priest's weaker CDs. A few good songs (Heading Out On the Highway, Hot Rockin')but mostly filler. For the longest time Priest would continue to play Desert Plains live, and I could never figure out why ... an average hard rock song at best."
4,A classic release but not original cover,"Almost everyone mention ""BRITISH STEEL"" (1980) and ""SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE"" (1982) when it comes to Judas Priest's finest work. This album, ""POINT OF ENTRY"" (1981) is kind of Priest's lost album even though it's a great album. It might not be as hard and heavy as ""BRITISH STEEL"", nor as catchy and melodic as ""SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE"" but Halford & Co delivers a great bunch of rocking tunes; especially ""Heading out to the highway"" and ""Hot rocking"" which both are among the best in Judas Priest's recording career. I dare to say that all of the songs on this album are good indeed and ""POINT OF ENTRY"" is without doubt one of the classic Priest albums. All of the songs have character and the material does not melt together which makes the album very pleasant. I assure you that you'll play this one year after year without growing tired of it"
4,Very Good Album,Judas Priest is an amazing band. I'm more of a classic rock fan than metal but Priest rocks. This album is by far different from their other work as far as the metal sound goes. Much more mello but still some great guitar work found here.This is a great album for someone who is not the biggest metal fan from a great metal band.
3,good but not brilliant,"basically this album pretty much has a strong track followed by a weak one all the way through. heading out to the highway is genius, along with turning circles (which does sound like spinal tap!)which i found quite amusing, along with desert plains, solar angels, on the run-are all good songs. the bonus track thunderoad is also enjoyable. however it does have patchy and embarassing moments such as you say yes"
5,Great Priest,"Ok, so this is not Screming for Vengance or Defenders of the Faith, but it still rocks. Heading out to the Highway should be in everybody's cd player. Great work"
2,Samsung SV-LB6 SLA Camcorder Battery from Batteries,"Got theses for an old camcorder,,The batteries work fine for about five months then they started to leak...ughh waste of $$$ #1"
3,Overall good but a different approach...,"I'm a huge GlobeTrekker fan so I'm very familiar with their productions and style....the first part of this, in Cyprus with KT Comer, is very typical...well produced, upbeat and informative and gives you a pretty good summary of the whole island. The second part, while Adela Ucar is a good host, she spends nearly all of her time devoted to the German invasion of Crete, talking to veterans and survivors of the experience and she only visits war sites and cities on the eastern third of the island and never goes anywhere else. For example, she only mentions on of Crete's most major cities and portals, Heraklion, but she doesn't actually go there. All in all, the but about Cyprus is well done, but Samantha Brown's show on Crete is far better than this one. Kind of a disappointment for me as I'm love the whole GlobeTrekker series."
1,Avoid Print Edition - horrible formatting,"This is a review of the paperback version of this book, not of the wonderful text by Edith Nesbit. This paperback edition appears to be a print-off of the out-of-copyright Kindle edition. It has terrible formatting, with margins that make reading very tiring. Get a different edition."
5,Loved it,my mum bought this book for my kindle and I loved reading it! I really enjoyed the story and the characters.
2,Not readable,"This version has a nice cover but is not readable. The font is extremely tiny and the pages look like they were photocopied. No illustrations, no formatting. If you just wanted it as a reference, I suppose it would work. I know my 8-year old for whom this was purchased would not read this copy. Amazon was nice enough to refund our money while allowing us to keep the book, which I will probably donate to my daughter's school's used book sale this spring."
4,A charming story,This a story of a family who move to the country during the absence of the husband and father. The children are left to their own devices as Mother writes stories to support them. The children are fascinated by a nearby railway line and station and through these make interesting friends and have exciting adventures. A most satisfying read!
3,Great story but some parts are missing on the free Kindle edn,"I never read this book as a child but I have thoroughly enjoyed the story. Considering that the children she writes about would have been between 90 and 100 years old now, the story is fresh and the childrens' interactions are timeless. It is an interesting social document too. Plus it is interesting to see how people lived when the newspapers, the Royal Mail and even the trains were the chief means of communication.On the other hand, there are some parts of the text - mostly the verses and writings of the children and their mother which don't come through (possibly because they were originally printed in a different font). Being able to read them would have added greatly to my enjoyment and earned the Kindle edition 5 stars instead of the 3 that I am giving it now. The story itself richly deserves 5 stars!"
1,BORING,"I absoloutly hated this book, it is extremely pointless and stupid and I couldnt make out much of a plot. It is interesting how it has been kept in print after 100 years.""Look here comes the train""""Lets wave flags at it and stand in the middle of the track to make it stop!""""Roberta get out of the way!""""But it hasn't..."" SPLAT!!Thats what should have happened, if you read this book you will see why.There is nothing more to say."
5,Read It!!!,"This is not simply a children's book. It is an extremely touching story of three children whose father is suddenly taken away from them and how they cope with the changed circumstances, how they adjust to ""play at being poor"" as their mother says. It is a book that is bound to enthrall you."
5,it was a great book,The story is about a rich and prefect family and how they turned to a very poor family.It was a great book.
5,The Railway Children,"Of all the books that charm people, this one has some fun, and some brave children.A mother, a father, and their three kids lived a great life. Until Father was accused of being a Russian spy and was put in prison. This event made it hard for his wife and 3 children. So they lived in a poor house near the train station. Phyllis (girl), Peter, and Bobbie (girl) had all sorts of adventures. From making Mr. Perks (a train guy) a birthday that he never celebrated, to watching a game and saved one of the games players. I can't tell you all that they did, it would make reading it easier!This book is pretty good (don't watch the movies unless you have finished the book.) I hope you get this book and enjoy it. I just finished it."
2,Disappointing,"Extreamly tedious to set. Ok, impossible. You receive a 40 page instruction booklet (you will need a magnifying glass). Good luck with that one. It has an easy to read face for the time. That's it. Date too small to easily read. Has three or four buttons, each seem to do 50 different functions. Who can figure out what? The alarm: the main reason to buy - remember the VCR that continuously blinks only one hour, welcome to the alarm beep... cavet emptor"
4,great,this product is great....i only wish the face and numbers were bigger. Otherwise I like this digi-watch very much andwill reorder to give as gift to friends.
5,excelent till now,"it's excellent till now! it's beautiful, and easy to use. functions are excellent. however, the instruction manual is so small."
3,better product description,"The watch is visually appealing. I would have preferred knowing there was no second hand and that the clasp was plastic not metal and I would have moved ""upscale"" a little bit."
1,Poor quality,"While the watch worked perfectly for several months, the plastic hinge connecting the strap to the watch broke for no apparent reason. As the watch only cost $15, it didn't pay to make a warranty claim."
4,Beautifully written and illustrated,This is a charming story that teaches children to care for others and for our Earth. Beautifully written and illustrated. Makes a great gift.
4,What this book is good for,"This is not a how to or tutorial book. It was written to convey the specifics of the ECMAScript standard so that web developers who are writing script can be assured of the highest level of browser compatibility. It you have to write a truly ""run anywhere on anything"" script, you should have this reference. Just don't read it when you are sleepy.The four star rating is not due to a lack of quality. As a PerfectScript programmer, I can tell you that Gordon McComb always does quality work. However, you can only do so much with a very dry and technical subject."
4,Surprisingly Thralling Read,"This book takes awhile to take off, with the first few chapters slow and thick. However, once you are introduced to the characters of Andrew and Sir John, it develops into a surprisingly gripping read. You'll want to know what Ellen Andrew wrote to the Boileaus, or what the Bishop of Norwich is up to. All in all, an interesting depiction of an unordinary example of a common relationship in 19th century Britain."
4,Just like old-fashioned rubber pants.,"These are super! Bought several pairs for each of my daughters for their baby showers and they loved them. They launder great, last long, and provide nearly the same over the diaper protection as regular ordinary rubber pants do."
3,Mediocre cover,"The cover was very big on my daughter when she was in the weight range for her size, although she is tall and slender. It was also much messier than the velcro covers at times. Can't beat the price, but I use them only as a last resort."
4,Love it but the strap can be better,My daughter is learning to tell time and this watch works out well. My only complain is the strap is hard to get on and off and gets loose easily.
2,Not a great first watch for a child.,"We purchased the Timex Children's Heart and Butterfly watch for our 5 year old daughter for Christmas. For a watch claiming to help children learn to tell time, the face and numbers are quite small and hard to see. The face is plastic, which became scratched the first time she wore it. Which leads me to the clasp...there is no way to adjust this watch for a small wrist. It is way too big for a 5 year old, and I had to sew it together to make it fit her wrist. The cheap metal clasp does not adjust....so keep that in mind!I would not recommend this product."
5,5-year-old's delight,My five year old granddaughter is delighted to have this watch. We'll see if she'll learn to tell time.
1,TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY,"This is the third Timex kids watch I have bought; I bought it to replace one that stopped working after a few months. I thought, oh well, it must have just been a lemon. WRONG. I gave this one to my daughter for her birthday, it worked for 6 days. I assumed it was the battery that wasn't working, ordered new batteries and replaced it, but it does not work. Tried to contact Timex about it, but it costs more to repair it than it cost to buy. Don't waste your money."
2,Not so water resistant,"My daughter ADORED her watch which was purchased in March, but after a few weeks of summertime use, this ""water resistant to 99 feet"" watch has been destroyed by a few trips to the neighborhood pool. The inside has condensation, the hands have stopped moving and the band is frayed and washed out. Very disappointed in the quality."
4,MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES IT.,THIS WATCH HAS A VERY CUTE DESIGN AND IT IS REALLY LOVED MY GRANDDAUGHTER. WE HAD GIVEN IT TO HER FOR CHRISTMAS..
3,"Watch good, but battery dead on delivery.",Good first watch for my first grader who is just learning to tell time. Not so happy with quality of product from Amazon. Watch arrived and battery was dead. Instead of going through the hassle of returning and the possibility of the same thing happening again we just replaced the battery. Not happy that I had to purchase a new battery for a brand new watch.
2,"Bag is good, plastic mount is not","After one use, the plastic handlebar mount was chewed up by the screws. The bag seems great otherwise but it needs more durable hardware. I wish I had spent more money on a better quality product."
4,Great if you don't want to take everything including the kitchen sink,"This bag is a little smaller than the one it replaces, which will make me take less in the bag, which may end up to be a good thing. If you want to take the camera, binoculars, wallet, cell phone and some snacks to eat along the way you would probably want to get a bigger bag. I love the removable map cover so I don't have to have it on while commuting around town, and is easily attached for my tours."
2,Tour Guid Bike Bag,"Although Topeak is a reputable name among recreational bikers, this particular bag has a problem slipping and flopping around. It was next to impossible to get it stationary on the handlebars, which made the map compartment an unusable feature."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I wouldn't call this a stylish watch by any stretch of the imagination. It's smaller than it looks in ads and looks like a fake watch you might have found in a Cracker Jack or cereal box. The band is very thin and I can't see it holding up for long.But it's a $10 watch. Personally, I'd rather pay a little more and get something with more features and better potential durability at double or triple the cost."
3,Difficult to read dial,"I have had several of these <$10 Casio watches (cheaper to buy a new one that to get a new battery put in) but this particular model has gold hands on a gold background. I recommend this watch with other faces, but not this one. It is extremely difficult to tell the time with it!"
1,Who would have thought....,"Who would have thought Casio would put gold hands on a gold faced dial. It makes telling time, even in daylight, nearly impossible. I put the watch in the Goodwill donation bag and chalked it up to a bad choice at the time."
4,I can see it!,"I bought this watch because I wanted a black watch I could wear all doing almost anything. It's thin and easy to wear, light weight and the face is large and light so it's easily read.My 27yr old son looked sideways at me because the band is plastic...perfect for me and all the things I get into during the course of the day. I love it.When this one wears out, I'll probably buy another. It fills all the slots."
5,Probably the best band to emerge out of Aussie!,"This CD is sooo underrated that it's almost non-existent, I'm sad to say. Let's get this band recognized, people! I don't have just one ""favorite"" on this album. THE WHOLE ENTIRE ALBUM IS EXCELLENT!!! They should be up there onstage receiving video music awards for there debut album that REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN the rock album of 2001! I think they should be just as popular as Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, or ANY post-grunge artists. They possess the uncanny ability to write amazingly mind-blowing guitar hooks that are very catchy, and deliver SO much power and emotion that it really is damn ""Perfect"" (hence the hit single.) Do yourself a favor, crash the party with Crash Palace, and buy this album because brother, these guys kick a-- and just plain ROCK, HANDS DOWN!!!"
4,But where are they now?????????,"I got this album a while back. Very Very good throughout.Putting on my sound-a-like, I would say a cross between Stone Temple Pilots and early Oasis, perhaps a dash of the Verve. They certainly can rock hard an heavy, some tunes have a nice trippy feel, some others are on softer side. Every time I pop this CD in for a listen, it stays in for a few days longer, and I find myself checking to see if they have some out with something new, then searching for any info. Such an ambitious release and no follow-up?"
1,"Elegant, but useless","Beautiful to look at, but a waste of money. I purchased the brass version of this lighter, I liked how it looked, it was very attractive, very elegant, but it was difficult to ignite, and after only using it a few times it completely stopped working."
2,"readable introduction, but flawed","""Celluloid Indians"" takes on a lengthy and complex history of Natives Americans in film from D.W. Griffith to Sherman Alexie. It offers discussions of nearly 60 films spanning the twentieth century. It highlights some general trends from negative to positive stereotypes, and then towards the depiction of Native Americans as human beings. The author's discussion of such films as ""Pocahontas"" and ""Sunchaser"" are perceptive. However, much of what she offers is derivative of the works of others, the research is thin, and there are egregious errors in her discussion of Federal Indian policy. Because of the general level of ignorance in American society of some of the political and historical context that Kilpatrick rightly identifies as relevant to these films, this book is horribly dangerous.The book offers a useful general overview, but readers must labor to verify many of her statements of fact."
1,Contributes Nothing New to the Field,"Celluloid Indians offers on overview of the history of Indians in the movies but rehases much of what has been done before. The author cuts and pastes long previously published excerpts from other articles and calls them her own. She adds merely a few comments to issues that have already been thoroughly discussed elsewhere. She knows little of Hollywood history, which makes her book nothing more than a superficial study of Native American images in the motion picture business. But perhaps the most annoying aspect of this book is that it's so one sided and determined to fault everything on Hollywood that it gets tiresome after a while. Isn't it time for this field to move beyond that stereotype?"
5,An Edge-of-Your-Seat Must-Read,"I'm a long-time fan of Rochelle Krich, and have always admired her intelligent writing in her finely crafted mysteries. Krich's ongoing development of Detective Jessie Drake, the ""star"" of many of her novels to date, has also added a deeper personal dimension to her mysteries, as Drake has uncovered some secrets of her own past (in previous novels) and continues to explore her own, previously unknown, Jewish identity.Other reviews here have given the basic storyline, so I'll just add that, having read nearly all Krich's other books, I felt that Shadows of Sin is among her very best, one that had me really on the edge of my proverbial seat. As with any good mystery, Krich packed a surprise ending, but one which was consistent with the rest of the story. It's a cliffhanger, to be sure. I don't think you'll be able to put it down!"
5,Great 80's Flashback,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, the 80's were a fun time. There are 2 songs that really stand out on this soundtrack, ""The Dream"" by Irene Cara and ""Single Heart"" by DeBarge."
3,"80's Nostalgia Mr. T and ""Chucks"" Adam Baldwin",DC Cab is a movie for those who aren't too critical of overall plot and performance. It was made in the early 80's as such it does have its share of cheesy overtones. It is enjoyable but perhaps maybe more geared to the cheesy 80's sitcom crowd.
4,good,this item arrived on time i watched it the other day was very funny and i recoomend if you want to watch a funny movie then this might be worth considering
4,Cab Comedy,"With the current movie ""Taxi"" with Queen Latifah, we can only hope they recognize that comedies about cab companies and cabbies can be funny. D.C. Cab is a sleeper of comedies that should be on DVD. Not many people have seen it, but those that have know that it is well worth your time. This cast mix is great and Mr. T is super as the lead. It is a nice look at the music and clothes at the time it was made in the 1980s. It is a in depth look at what cab drivers and cab companies are about and the day to day life for a driver. I have recommended this movie to a number of friends. Most are surprised at how funny the movie is and that they haven't heard of it before. I recommend this movie. Unfortunately it is hard to find on VHS. Let us hope the studio wises up and gets this on DVD as soon as possible."
1,i pity this...,"i dont know what the rest of the people who gave this movie five stars were smoking, but this movie was terrible! The only funny person in the movie is Mr. T, and thats just because of his tight clothes and deep comical voice. He wasn't even wearing his gold!"
1,Garbage,"I saw this film becuase people tell me I remind them of the Gary Busey character. I don't know what they are talking about- he played an annoying, loud buffoon.Besides that, the movie is just stupid. Mr. T got top billing and he was barely in it. He was much better as Clubber Lang.Bill Maher has moved on to much better things as well.Skip this turkey and see something worthwhile. ""Murder in the First"", perhaps."
3,Different And Fun,"Rival taxi companies, Mr. T... What else is there? Oh, yeah, a gang of clowns and Gary Busey. So, it's not an award winner. But with all the makings of a cult fave, it deserves a chance. Lots of fun, I say. My only complaint is that Mr T. didn't show up more often. And I don't think he said ""I pity the fool."" Oh well, I think you owe it to yourself to experience D.C. Cab, at least once."
5,All-time best Mr. T movie about D.C. cab drivers!,"Mr. T's performance in ""D.C. Cab"" must be seen to be believed! He is so committed to the role that when you see him driving a cab, you really feel like Mr. T could drive a car! I think he probably udnerwent some special training in preparation for his role, kinda like how Dustin Hoffman hung out with autistic people before making ""Rain Man."" The amount of research Mr. T put into his part in this film is simply astounding. When Mr. T wants the cab to go left, he turns the wheel to the left rather than rely on some cheesy special effects to make it look like he turned the wheel to the left. How did Mr. T undergo such comprehensive training and still maintain his superbly developed physique? Sheer willpower! Mr. T drinks his milk and pities the fool who doesn't think he can drive a cab just like the professionals!"
4,Still a smash 23 years later,"I really enjoyed DC Cab, it was always one of my favorite movies.To see some of the stars from the eighties and compare them to where they are today was interesting to say the least. The music was excellent for that time period, brought back fond memories."
3,Cheesy but funny,if you think your Roger Ebert don't watch the movie it's a low budget film with some up and comming actors for there time(Bill Mahr)(MR.T)I liked the movie as a kid and think it's funny to some degree now
1,Rampant cocaine use during entire filing,"I was ""around"" during the filming of D C Cab and most of the actors and most of the crew were coked up throughout the filming. Most scenes were shot and not even edited because of budget restraints. Look carefully at Gary Busey's eyes during every single scene. He's so high he can hardly slow down his lines. The same is true of most of the other actors who are either conspiculously quiet and speechless in scenes or are over animated. Coke is the reason that this film has so few close up shots and why, in almost every scene, the actors are just running, jumping around and/or screaming- both inside the cab sets and out. This movie, from my view, is a sad example of a possibly funny movie devolving into a cocaine fueled manic mess of scenes strung together into a releasable product. The project was such a negative experience that few or none of those involved would ever work together again."
3,d c cab,We loved the movie when it was on tv. I did not realize there was nudity in it though. I wish it was not there because I do not want my granddaughter watching it now.
5,Great guide...,Possibly the best available guide when you start getting acquainted with debating societies.
3,A good book for debate,"This book is good for students as well as teachers to identify how to debate, and has a lot of controversial topics to argue. Through this book, you are going to broaden your horizon, and have confidence whenever you debate with others."
5,Nothing BUT pros.........,"This is the most usefull book I have ever read. Suppling excellent arguments for and against topical points that are easily understood, this has proved its value on more than one occasion(sic) for me."
1,Famous Maker Supima Bath Towel 2-Pack with Free Washcloth,Unfortunately these towels are not so good.After drying myself with them the towels left behind small little dust sized pieces on my body that I'll just call towel fragments. And small tiny tiny pieces of fabric are now missing from the towel itself.It's especially bothersome when I shave and then use the towel to dry my face. There are tiny fragments of the towel on my face that I have to remove.Now I'm told to always look for combed yarn towels. He told me that the Supima Bath Towels are carded. That they used a cheaper yarn in the carded towels. And that combed yarn is more money.
5,A beautiful and uplifting book,"I first read this book in college in 1987, and go back to it every few years when I need to be reminded how wonderful life is. It is beautifully written, incredibly funny and very, very moving. I don't know why this book isn't more widely read, it certainly deserves to be."
4,Outstanding Novel,"My first exposure to Howard Frank Mosher will lead me back to his other books immediately. This is one of the best written books of fiction I have read. There is a sharp turn away from the story about 3/4 of the way through that is momentariliy disconnecting. I bounced through it and found I needed to pay close attention the rest of the way. This book is hilarious, colorful, whimsical but in an eloquent sense. 4 stars is my highest rating and this greatly deserves it."
5,"Cute, quick read for my son","My son likes owls so I bought this book and ""Ollie"" the Owl for him for Christmas. He is two and seems really interested in the pictures and story. The story is three owls wake up and their mommy is not there, it's dark and they're scared. It's good on many levels - mommy comes back, there was no reason for all the fuss, no need to be afraid of the dark, etc. So, if you're having nighttime or separation anxiety problems, it's a good story to help reinforce that it's ok. You'd probably have to ""link"" the story to the issue for your child by talking to them but I think it could be a good tool.The story is sweet as just a story too. The pictures are nicely done. I guess I too have a soft spot in my heart for owls..."
5,Great Book,My son fell in love with this book at the library so we bought a copy. Now my daughter wants to read it every night.
5,Owl Babies,"I clicked in a hurry and didn't notice that this included a DVD story along with the book, but I LOVED it! My students LOVED it and I have many colleagues asking to borrow it."
5,Great bedtime read!,"This book has been one of my toddler's bedtime favorites for the last few months. She loves to hear how Sarah, Percy, and Bill wait for their mommy in the dark of the woods, and how their mommy always comes back. It has helped her understand that even when Mommy or Daddy go to work, they will be back soon and will miss her all the while. At first, I thought the concept or dark pages would scare her, but she loves this book and asks for it every night. I recommend it!"
3,This is UK version,I was trying to purchase the cd version I had checked out of the library - read by Lorelei King - and this is not it.
2,Owl Babies,I was a little disappointed in this book. It was not a smooth story that was easy for toddlers to understand. the graphics were not sharp and clear like toddlers like to see.
2,Owl Babies (The board book),"Three baby owls awake one night to find their mother gone. Alone in the dark and understandably frightened, the older babies discuss where she may be while the youngest cries, ""I want my mommy!"" Mom owl finally appears and assures her babies that she will always come back. Although this book addresses a common concept familiar to toddlers and pre-schoolers-Will Mommy come back if she leaves?-I have to say that it should have remained a picture book. Although the black ink and watercolor crosshatched illustrations on a black background are very realistic, they set an ominous tone that, in tandem with the plot, I am not certain should be introduced to very young children; at least not introduced before bed time..."
2,Terrified Owl Babies,"The beautiful artwork in this book doesn't mask a storyline that is way too upsetting for a young child. From the perspective of a 3-year old, mama owl disappears on page 1 and doesn't return until the last page. The pages inbetween show 3 gorgeously drawn little birds in the throes of anxiety over the loss of their mama. As an adult, I found it unsettling as well. Too bad the talented artist got hooked up with a hold-over author from Grimm's Fairy Tales."
2,A Tale of Abandonment that is not reassuring,"My mom has her BA in child psychology and she thinks this is a great book, my sister with two sons loves it but I as the aunt with no children dislike it.This book tells the story of three baby bird who wake up to discover they are alone. The best part of this book is that there discussion about where mom has gone keeps them from getting into mischief. The worst part is that it gives the impression that mom will sneak out during the night without so much as a goodbye-I don't personally know a good mother that will do that as it just increases the anxiety experienced by a child.Gave it 2 rating because somehow my nephews love it. I personally prefer other books like the editor said that create a better scenario to help children cope with separation anxiety."
4,Owl Babies for my babies,"I picked this book up at our local library on impulse. I didn't think it'd be a huge hit with my youngest (2 years old), but thought my early readers might enjoy it. Turns out I was half right. My 2, 4 and 7 year olds all love this book! My 10 year old volunteers to read it to them daily. After having a library copy for only a few days I realized this one needed to be added to our personal collection. The illustrations are beautiful, the repetition is great and the moral of the story is lovely."
3,"For some reason, it falls flat for us","It's a good little book - mom is gone, the kids worry, mom comes back and everybody is happy.But I really can't get the kids to show very much interest in it, and I don't often choose it to read either."
5,An immediate favorite (at under 4 months!),"My best friend, a teacher, gave me this book as a shower gift and stated it was her children's favorite book. I started reading to my son at 3 months and found it hard to keep his attention (go figure) until I picked up this book. It has been his absolute favorite from the beginning. I never would have imagined a baby so young having preferences, but he absolutely did. He could be crying, I would pull out this book and start reading, and he would immediately calm down. If I switched to another book, the fussing would again begin. He is now 6 months old and I believe it was because of this book that he looks forward to story time every night. We are up to 5 board books a night, and always end with Owl Babies. The best part for me - it is beautifully drawn and is a sweet, well told story that does not make you feel like pulling your hair out because you have to read it again (and again, and again!)"
5,Favorite for preschoolers,"One of my favorite books to read aloud to preschoolers. The illustrations are beautiful and realistic. The story is sweet and loving, and the children love the predictability."
5,Indestructable Version of a Book We Already Loved,"When my oldest was a baby, we read this book so much to her that she started reciting it out loud to herself by memory but almost had us fooled into thinking she could read at 2! After my third child ripped the paperback version of this much-loved book to shreds, we were so happy to discover it came in board book form. Great story and illustrations. You can't go wrong with this book, especially with the toddler set."
4,Poor Bill~,"This is a funny little book~ Poor little ""Bill"" is clearly the littlest owl, and he just misses his momma. My children have enjoyed this book from the Eldest to the Youngest."
5,2 year old loves it!,My daughter asks us to read this book to her often. It's such a sweet story - it helps explain to the little ones that even if mommy leaves for a bit - she will come back. Great book!
5,"Buy this book for your baby, child, friend..","Based on positive reviews, I ordered Owl Babies for my 3 yr old daughter. The story is enchanting, 3 owl babies wake up alone and fret over their missing mommy owl. Of course, mom comes back and all is well. The art work is incredible, you will feel the need in the babies eyes as they wait for their mommy. We now read this book every night before bedtime, and it brings us to a very intimate point before the little one nods off to sleep."
5,Utterly perfect,"I first came across this truly beautiful book when it was read on Teletubbies one morning. I cried! - and simply had to buy a copy for my little girl. Abby is now almost two and we read this book every night - often more than once. It is the most interactive book she has - she pulls sad faces and everytime Bill says ""I want my mummy"", Abby screws up her face and says ""Ohhhh poor Bill!"" When mummy finally comes home she is so excited that she too flaps up and down! She adores its. I couldn't recommend this book highly enough. Every child needs their own copy of this, Martin Waddell's and Patrick Benson's finest work."
5,Great gift book.,I bought these for my wife as she loves to give this book as gifts. We bought one for a baby gift and another to have when the opportunity arises again. Our kids loved for us to read this book to them when they were young.
5,Five stars!,"Very funny! I always love a book that makes students call out, ""read it again!"" this edition came with a CD, but I prefer to read it myself."
5,A Must Read,"Every teacher, politician, and school administrator in the United States should be required to read this book. Unlike the usual ""school reform"" books, its purpose is not to point fingers and assign blame- its written so that people better understand the central problem. You won't agree with 100% of the author's conclusions, but you'll see value and truth in at least 95%. An excellent book. Period."
2,"Decent story, but not very well-produced","Not very good in any respect. Just half-hearted acting, writing, producing and music. The ending is predictable but I felt like they just looked for a spot to end the flick and used it. Don't bother buying this one.They never did come out with a sound track since I heard John Oates had a song on it called ""You Can't Get There From Here""."
2,"Okay, but needs to be updated","This book definitely needs to be updated. I was able to use it for general information, but when it came to actually getting around and practical advice for restaurants, hotels, etc., I found the Top Ten guide much more helpful. In retrospect, I would not have purchased this book."
2,Pick up your game lonely planet,"Can lonely planet just photocopy a book, put online and call it an ebook?Maps were completely unreadable.Very difficult to flip between text and the relevant maps. I had to actually go and buy the the hard copy.I WANT MY MONEY BACK!I only use LP travel guides. Won't be using the ebook version til they bring themselves into the 21st century. Let me know when this happens.Very disappointed."
4,Helpful,I found this book helpful and easy to use. I liked it better that Fodor's. Those travelling in Barcelona should be warned against the muggers. I was violently mugged less than a block from my hotel off of La Rambla. I heard many other similar tales from those who were in Barcelona at the time or have been there at other times.
2,Old Information,"We used Lonely Planet guidebooks all over Europe while we were there with our kids for 7 months. This book was the first time Lonely Planet let us down.The book is organized badly and it was full of bad information. Two of the restaurants that were recommended in the book (both of which sounded as if they had been there forever) were nowhere to be found. In fact, one was a pile of rubble. This was very frustrating when you're hungry and you're dragging four kids around the city looking for a place to eat."
1,Get what you pay for,"Not good at all. Just wanted to make milkshakes and smoothies. Ice cream and solid items stay on side and need to be pushed into blade by hand. Cover does not ""lock"" on blender and needs to be held in place. Went for low price at Rite-Aid and lost. I'd recommend another blender."
1,4 smoothies in it broke!,"I liked the small footprint and low price of this blender. And it seemed to do well even crushing frozen strawberries for smoothies, but the parts do not fit snuggly together and I think this caused it to break. The entire spinning mechanism under the jug splintered and sent out acrid smoke one morning and that was it for this blender. It is worth it to get a slightly pricy model made with hardier materials."
3,a bargain,"This blender is very inexpensive and the price affects its performance. The jar is plastic, and it became dull after just several uses. The motor is powerful, but the controls are not very precise. However, it does very well what I bought it for- to make smoothies for my kid."
2,"Good for smoothies, not much else","It's definitely cheap and a bargain. The blades are great but there will be some chunky bits at the sides and you have to shake the jar a bit to ensure a smooth texture at the end. I tried using it to make sauces and that doesn't work very well.However, all the jug parts were detachable and it's very easy to clean.Bottom line: Works okay but not great. ConsiderBraun MR430HC/AC Multiquick Deluxe Hand Blender & Chopper"
1,Replacing It Immediately,"This blender is a great design for easy storage in minimal space. However, performance is poor. The lid does not fit securely on the pitcher and rotates as you use the blender. This allows the spout to be exposed and whatever you are blending to come flying out. It is underpowered for making smoothies or milk shakes and the small pitcher is not really helpful in a family setting. After replacing my 20-year old Oster Blender with this one I was really disappointed in the lack of improvement in blenders. I will be replacing it this evening with something better designed, probably from Williams Sonoma - Right after I clean up the spray from the spout in my kitchen."
1,Cats would not use this!,I bought this item for my cats a few years ago. I thought they would love to go in and out of it and sleep in it too. Well they both looked at it once and then ignored it! They NEVER went in it or even looked at it after that. I ended up selling it to a neighbor along with my cat hammock (another loser!)
1,Tired Breath of the Heart,"I've really enjoyed the other Krishna Das music I've heard, but this album is a terrible departure from his traditional work. The first song/chant about Hanuman is really beautiful and might be a good enough reason to buy the album. The rest of the album s..ks. It is pathetic. I got the impression he was phoning in his lines. like they say of bored actors who can't get motivated for a performance. The other Krishna Das albums are worth getting, at least the ones I've listened to and bought. But LEAVE THIS ONE ON THE SHELF."
5,Love it,"I first heard this record at my yoga studio and looked forward to hearing it in class when it was included in the mix. Naturally, I had to have it at home. It really keeps me going when I'm cleaning the house or doing a lot of cooking. I bring it on long road trips when I know I'm going to need a bit of a zen/""serenity now"" moment."
5,Great,Going on the computer was easy and quick. I got what I needed at a good price. Great job I will use you again.
4,Let us now praise John Updike,"The finest writer of post WWII fiction is still at it. With ""Licks of Love,"" ""More Matter,"" and ""Gertrude and Claudius"" all published very recently--John Updike, hopefully, has secured his Nobel Prize. Let us hope he gets while he is still around."
4,The 70's meets the 90's!,"""Halifax's bastard sons do it again for the first time."" That's the catch-phrase for Thrush Hermit's '97 effort, Sweet Homewrecker, their first major label release. Sweet Homewrecker, recorded in Memphis, Tn. delivers a sound that is one part classic 70's rock and one part 90's Halifax pop which makes it hard to resist. From the single, ""North Dakota"" to the witty ""Heart Wrenching Man"", ""Skip the Life"" and ""I'm Sorry That Your Heart Has No More Room"", Sweet Homewrecker Rocks!"
4,Well worth the $$,"I can highly recommend this album/band for fans of Superchunk, the Replacements or the Mayflies. It is definitely power pop at it's best. I can say that because the lyrics are intelligent, interesting and at times sweet. The singer's voice reminds me of Superchunk. The guitars rock out, very simple, garage, indie rock sound. The production is great, overlaying great guitar parts. I would highly recommend this album."
3,two songwriters.....and one of them must be stopped.,"on the whole, this is a good album...but it would have been a GREAT one if j. plasket had written all the songs. i don't know why they let the other guy, r. benvie, anywhere near a pen. consequently, the album has more peaks and valleys than an e.k.g.. fortunately 8 of the 14 songs are plasket's, so go buy it, filter the benvie cuts out of your playlist, and enjoy your mini l.p.."
4,"""Carny"" Time","It's ""Carny"" time folks. Tom Russell explores another music style blending story telling, talking blues and biographies in this album. ""Van Ronk"" tells the behind the scenes story of hanging out with Dave Van Ronk, talking music, political and drinking white wine. The West Coast and the beat generation is introduced as well as the hard times in Bakersfield on ""Grapevine"" The stories are spell-binding. It's an album that you need to sit down and listen to...there's just so much that if you drive and listen you'll miss out."
5,confortable,"very easy to use. It is small but with great simplicity. The stripper is strong. No heavy, and cut very clear"
4,Remastered but cheated...,"It sounds great but would it have killed the owners of the respective licences to include a select few bonus cuts, say Laura Branigan's GLORIA, which played a pivotal role in one of the film's scenes.FAME and FOOTLOOSE (companion pieces to FLASHDANCE) were re-issued with additional tracks so what gives?"
5,Good music,Its been a long time since I listened to the Flashdance Soundtrack. But this brought back some good memories to me. I even copied a couple of the songs to my Computer.
5,Empowering,"A true gem. If you are an eighties child or not, consider your selfquite lucky to be able to discover this album on your own and bathein its rare qualities of having the appeal to womens empowerment andthe softer sensitive side of male reverence for femininity.Surpisingly stacked with winning numbers that are at wideturns foot-stomping, melodic, hip swaying, hypnotic and evento use the words just plain awe inspiring is not to beoverly gratituous.This is how all music from the eighties through to the ninetiesshould have stayed.This music is a gift you give to your self and a secret youlet only your best of friends in on."
4,Misses one song?,"Original soundtrack from the montion picture doesn't have the song ""Gloria"" (From the iceskating scene) on it."
2,Outside of Maniac...where is the good songs,"Maniac sealed the deal and for some long forgotten reason, I thought that the tunes were here as the movie did rock or was it just Jennifer Beals who did?"
3,Flash dance the soundtrack.,"there are only a few songs that i enjoy on the sound track, but other than that i think the soundtrack is good."
3,Pretty good better at the time,this disc was better at the time but is still pretty good.Irene Cara sang the Lights out of Flashdance what a feeling.i used to have a crush on her.her voice&beauty went hand&hand.Maniac was catchy as well by Michael Sembello.
2,Unwanted order got ordered,"Undesirable and undesired item that I did not prder (or did not intend to order) but somehow managed to place in my basket is the same BAD, terrible soundtrack (save Irene Cara's finale) from the same abysmal movie we all hated (but made a hit) in the 1980s and wish we never had to hear again. And now I own one! I hope none of my friends see this. Ugh!"
1,this keyboard looks cool but it is a peice of cr*p,"I purchased this keyboard a month ago and the letters started chipping off about a week ago..a, s, m, and e are almost completely chipped off now and suddenly the r wont type when I hit it sometimes..I have to now proof read what I type and fill in the r's hitting it 2 or 3 times before it will type one..the keyboard sure looks cool, it is small so saves space, and best of all it lights up!! but dont let all that fool you..it is unreliable."
1,Very disappointing!,"Although this does show you some aspects of how to assess a shelter dog, this video barely teaches anything useful. It is very incomplete. It is a recording of a class the instructor was giving to a group of people. It is not the entire class, and mentions things she discussed previously without explaining them. It also almost exclusively shows well behaved dogs. The very few aggressive dogs that are filmed, do not show very much. The instructor says things like; ""I can't tell you how to understand this, it is something you'll just know with experience."" Well, if we have to learn it by ourselves, why are we buying the DVD? It also did not include the forms and rating scales it advertised, so you never really understand how the dogs are rated and what the ratings mean. I was very disappointed in this video. I would not recommend it."
3,The Three Stooges.The Early Years.,"This DVD is great value for the price.Even more worthwhile if your interested in film history.Four of these shorts are well known classics featuring either Curly or Shemp Howard as the third Stooge.Some of the other shorts on this disc feature members of the Three Stooges in solo film before they came together as a team.A couple feature the full Stooges line-up with Ted Healy.I find the Ted Healy stuff very poor quality,but interesting if you are interested in seeing how their early vaudeville performance would have been like on stage."
5,"Good, but it get a little boring when viewed over and over.","I have to say it. ""Disorder in the Court"" is one fo the funniest, especially when Larry and Curly play Moe's ribs like an accordion. ""Malice in the Palace"" is okay, with the funniest scene being when Shemp and Moe think Larry killed the cat and the dog and served it to the diners."
1,3 stooges Global Classics Colorized DVD,"only 2 shorts, both of which have been on numerous cheap dvds. the print quality is fair and the colorization is a distraction. a big difference from the Columbia/Sony release of color shorts which are much higher quality."
1,Can someone list the shorts on this DVD?,"Having recently seen the Warner Archives DVD of THE LOST STOOGES hosted by Leonard Maltin, I am interested in seeing as many of the non-Columbia shorts (and clips from features) as possible featuring the Stooges (both together, separately, and with Ted Healy). I nearly purchased the SHEMP COCKTAIL DVD until I found that it only contained 3 shorts that I hadn't seen, and those in very poor condition.Can someone who has this collection list the shorts collected on this DVD?"
1,This Sucked!,"I bought this and NONE of the old shorts talked about in the reviews above are there. Only the standard 4, ya know, ""those"" four...."
5,A Gem,"If you can find a used copy of this, snatch it up. Yes, we don't need more copies of DISORDER, BRIDELESS, MALICE and SING but that's not the reason to buy this. The other 8 shorts are rare and for some of them this is the only DVD release they have gotten or will get. Shemp solo shorts are especially hard to find."
2,Historical but very disappointing,"I love the Stooges but this was very disappointing. This focuses primarily on Ted Healy. Some of the shorts don't even have all of the stooges in them. This is a good look at the pre-stooge era but it isn't the Three Stooges. The one bright spot was ""Disorder In The Court"". I have a few other Stooge videos and DVD's and I don't think that this one is on any of the ones I own. The other Three Stooges shorts I already have."
3,Retro Humor,"You have to be in the right frame of mind to get a chuckle out of ""The Three Stooges"" as advanced techniques have raised expectations, but if you can transport yourself back in time, some of the routines are still cute. ""Malice in the Palace"" is the best on this DVD. It's based on misunderstanding and inaccurate assumptions, like most Stooge pieces are.""Disorder in the Court"" plays on another recurring Stooge theme, that of taking yourself and life too seriously. In the end the hapless baffoons save the day. It isn't as well written as ""Malice,"" but is still an interesting piece to look at in terms of representing comedy of the era."
2,Fergitaboutit,"The four public domain shorts are good, but everywhere.Ted Healy was incredibly UNfunny. He held the Stooges down.When the Stooges left that jerk, they soared. Historicly interesting;Yes. Funny;No It's a small wonder Healy got stomped to death in a bar-room."
1,You won't laugh at this turkey!,"If you bought this useless DVD already, then I have some bad news for ya! This only has two shorts, and all four public domain shorts are now available on a single DVD, restored, in color, and in B&W! It was released in early 2005 on 20th Century Fox, and for the same price as this joke! It's called ""Three Stooges In Color"", and is available right here at Amazon! If you're considering buying this, buy the other one instead, or I'll tear your tonsils out! Sure, three of those shorts feature Shemp, but who back then could get away with saying ""Go on, sister, or I'll knock your brains out!"" on film?!"
2,Not Very Good,"Disorder In The Court&Brideless GroomThose are the only two comedy shortson the entire disc; what was the point?Not a bad idea for a DVD release,but come on...fill the DVD up more.This was just a waste."
3,poor quality made up by rarities,"Buy this if you are interested in Ted Healy's productions from really early Stooge days. If not, skip it. The quality (audio and video) of the DVD is shabby...hence, the low price. There are only 4 of 12 shorts really worth owning, available on other, higher quality products."
4,"O'Connor's complexity and beauty, but this is not her greatest work","Tarwater, a fourteen year-old boy, has been groomed by his religious-zealot uncle to be a prophet and to baptize his mentally handicapped cousin. When his uncle dies at the breakfast table, Tarwater attempts to reject his destiny and goes to live with his other uncle (a realist philosopher) and cousin. He equally rejects this realist version of the world as much as he desires to reject his destiny as a prophet. The bizarre story is typical O'Connor irony, mixed with the grotesque and the sacred, revealing the warped souls and minds of man, while revealing the beauty of our world. It is unearthly and completely bound to the earth. The book has some stunning baptismal imagery and symbolism, a confusing and wondrous theme. But the book meanders and disappoints. Though I adore her amazing short stories, novels are not her strength. Grade: B"
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this cat toy! Last year I bought one each for my cat, my daughter's cat, and my friend's cat; the three cats were different ages (from 4 to 14) and different sizes. Not one of the three would have anything to do with this: they looked at it once, then walked away."
1,Couldn't get my cats inside even once,"I thought this item was cute and bought three for my cats. Being cats, they decided that they didn't like these fish bags one bit. The product was cute, and well made. It just didn't appeal to my cats.If you have multiple cats, just buy one and see what the cats think before ordering more."
2,Common Knowledge....No Practical Advice,"This is a good book for those scientists who are really, truly hiding under a rock, but will not be helpful for most others. The book can be summed up in a few sentences: Be nice to everyone you meet. Do good work. Don't allow yourself to get walked on. Now you can move on to a book with some practical advice like ""Tomorrow's Professor."""
3,"Smoke Machine, Leather Teddy, Black Widow Guitar, Gigantic Hair.....Check","This is a great little disk. If you are familiar with Lita Ford because of her smash album ""Lita"" only, do yourself a favor and pick up this disk. Outside of showing her butt in various leather G-strings, Lita Ford is also known for being able to shred a mean guitar, and proves it with this disk. The tunes presented here aren't as ""pop metal"" as what is featured on later releases. The title song is a straight up hair metal rocker. ""Ready Willing and Able"" is nice bluesy rock tune while ""Rock and Roll made Me What I am Today"" is a cool tune featuring a very cool guitar track.If you are a fan of hair metal, this disk is well worth the $[...] investment. Lita Ford was one of the only women to ""break"" into the world of hair metal, and it wasn't on looks alone. She is a solid guitarist, and writes some great tunes."
3,handbook,"This is a used copy - it's fine and arrived swiftly. A good handbook for teaching ESL writing. Plenty of grammar exercises, reading - closed-ended to more open-ended by the end of the book. Exercises progress from easier to more challenging by the end of the book."
2,Not what is shown in the picture,"The item seen online is difinitly not wwhat was shipped. Online it states the tea set is ceramic(actually tin). It has no pink mostly red, black and white. It is very tiny and not what was expected. I was purchasing this set for my seven year old for christmas to replace a ceramic set she has since she was 2 yrs. This set was a disappointment when i recieved it, I could because of the size and especially because it's not ceramic. I should have added $5-$10 more and purchase something that had a basket, napkins etc. Not pleased with this purcahse at all. It's a wastes of money. Check a department store for this item it'll be a lot cheaper that $18.99."
2,Too Smart For Thier Own Good,"Lockridge, a new socialist writer, bases his text on wills, deeds, and other hard evidence. This makes for an acedemically full but un-interesting read. He does do a good job of showing how the Puritans failed by succeeding. For anyone looking for the most complete view of early New England, this is it."
3,Contentment Plantation Original Nomenclature,Double descendent of founders. No doubt distressed given current antithesis to their strict mores.O tempora! O mores!
5,Music from our colonial heritage,"Historical and entertaining. This CD presents many songs from the Colonial era as they would have been played and heard then on period instrumentation.Songs: Brookline/Dwell at EaseOne Evening Having Lost My WayHopkinson's Dedication to George Washington: Come Fair Rosina/My Love Has Gone to SeaFrom Erin to the New World: O Blame Not/Ned of the HillSergeant Champe (Barbara Allen)Across the Waters: The Banks of Newfoundland/The Greenland Whale Fishery/ShenandoahWould Fate to Me Belinda GiveAmerica, Commerce, And FreedomOh Dear, What Can the Matter BeThe Lass of Pattie's Mill/Down in the North CountryCornwallis' Country Dance: Yankee Doodle/Quick Step/Brighton CampWould Fate to Me Belinda Give (Reprise)"
5,This works.,"More painful than shaving and way less painful than waxing. The first time I used this product, I used it on my bikini line. The hair didn't return for over a week. There was no irritation either like with shaving and waxing. I convinced myself to buy this product because if the hair remover didn't work I could still use the electric razor... but honestly I haven't even tried that part yet because I've been so pleased with the hair remover."
3,Easy but slow,I wanted some easy razor mainly for leg hair but versatile enough for other body hair. My only concern about this item is its low potency... it takes forever for the legs. I had an other before that was really more powerfull. After reading the manual I realized there is an other model that has two power levels!! if you can go for this one!
2,High expectation,Item was a great idea but it couldn't do its job efficiently. I was okay with the pain which most of us already know it from waxing but eppilator's functionality was not unique enough for all those comments from other users. Sorry but I don't recommend this product. Maybe with different maker.
3,Half good in my opinion,"I liked Sander's disc a lot. His style is very off-beat and different than most of his peers. He has a taste for mixing unusual trance and house tracks as his style. I enjoyed his mix as much as his other ""This is Everybody"" compilations and perhaps the best of the 5 total discs in his sets.On the otherhand, I cannot say much for the Burridge compilation. To me, it was boring. It didn't have the flash and sounds I have come to love in the Electronica genre. His style is much more subtle than the multi-layered and complex rhythms of most trance/house stylings. Much more simple synth cords over solid beats. Not quite my taste, but perhaps others differ."
1,Disappointing,There's nothing here but a bunch of disjointed tracks mixed together. The only outstanding track is: Dark Matter(Original)/West London Deep which I listen to over & over. The rest is a strain to listen to.
5,Pretty darn good,"Both CD's are excellent. I prefer Lee's CD slightly over Sanders, but I truly enjoy both. Both house/tech, a bit dark & funky. My new favorite song is 2 Bullets by Michoacan. Both CD's are worth the price I paid."
1,Sander seems to release one great recording for a while,"and since the previous one was absolutely amazing, this one is....I threw it out the car window. I've never heard such boring and random acts wimp ness as this recording is. So sticking to my trend next one should be much better."
5,Takes some getting used to,"Once I heard muscle car I was instantly hooked. This is the same track on Cream Summer 2006. I have to admit, I didn't like this cd at first, but I gave it a chance and it is rocking. A lot of fuzzy distorted techno beats make for a solid progressive album. Tracks 2, 6 & 9 shine. Mr Roboto is a catchy track too, pretty cool. Sander's set ends with a bang with the last two tracks, 12 & 13. Lee Burridge's set is a unique as they come and takes some getting used to."
4,Well worth the money,"I'm going to disagree with the other reviewers and say that the Sander K disc is much better than the Lee disc. Don't get me wrong as they are both very good...however the Sander disc really gives you an idea on what a live set would sound like from a talented DJ.Sadly, I have seen Sander K live several times and have been disappointed each and every time."
1,what is this?,"I bought On Tour expecting to have another amazing set of music from Sander K, but I was terribly wrong. The style of both CDs is electro and it will give you a headache after 15 minutes of listening to it. Sander K has always been one of my top 5 favorite DJs, but this is so disappointing. I try to avoid writing negative reviews, but I want to give a sign of warning for those who bought the first two sets. Listening to this set makes you wonder if this was even produced by the same DJ. It is good for artists to change up their music and crossover into new boundaries, however, this is not what you'd expect compared to the previous releases. This album may strike your taste buds and if you like listening to what sounds like machine chatter then look no further."
4,i liked it,"not a totally jaw dropping mix or anything, but i definately wont be deleting any of this off my ipod. got some really catchy songs."
1,What's in a PhD.?,"A sad, obviously biased, non objective vituperation by an angry man. A non imaginative, over simplistic expostulation by a mind that because of its obvious limitations, translates what it cannot comprehend into terms which it can: a regrettable purchase and waste of time."
4,good,"i like these, however both of my girls have skinny legs so they tend to leak. these are better for chunky thighs... if your kid has skinny legs try the bummis whisper wrap///well worth the investment..."
1,Horrible fit,I bought these for my 12lb infant and found that they did not breath or fit very well and leaked right away. They were too big and did not hold the cloth diaper at all. The cloth diaper fell apart under the cover even with the use of snappies holding them on. Also the legs holes seemed to be cut too low compared to the rise and my infant has chunky thighs and the elastic leg holes pinched his skin too much. I do not recommend these and would recommend a fitted diaper cover with velcro so it can conform to your babies shape.
2,Cheap price = cheap bag,"Real camera bags of the same size with more recognizable names (Lowepro, Kata, Crumpler, etc.) will run you about three times the price of this bag, but the extra money is worth it. After only the fourth day of use, the plastic strap buckle broke, and sent my camera and lenses straight to the pavement. My advice to you is to think about how much you paid for the photo equipment your bag is supposed to protect, and spend accordingly."
3,"Does the trick, feels cheap though","Good size pockets, customizable, feels cheap and unsubstantial. Would be fine for an amateur/lower end dslr kit but not sufficient for a professional."
5,One bag carries all...,"Large enough For my T1i with lense on + Extra telephoto lense, Sony camcorder, Canon Powershot, Chargers for all those, USB cables and wires,batteries, Memory card and few pens as well. I had space left for manuals as well (Just in case).Only accessory left out was of course the tripod :). If you know how to arrange properly, this is the right choice. :)"
5,Love It !,"Soothing , inspiring and timeless . I never get tired of this and it is UPLIFTING ! If you like this check out Barry Phillips, ans William Coulter also . Lovely to the nth degree !"
3,Just about works,works most of the times. Switching on/off is a trial and error. But works well once it starts.I got 2 pieces. One worked other did not.
2,Terrible product...,"I bought this watch and about a week after I bought it started to get scratches all over the face. Then only about a month later the watch started randomly stopping and ticking backwards. Don't buy this watch, it's not worth it."
3,"Great looking, not durable","This watch lasted about six months. During that time, I had to frequently push the stem in get the watch to run -- reset the correct time and then maybe it would go a couple of days before repeating this pattern. Now, a piece of the case that holds the band on, broke-off and there is no way to repair this inexpensive watch. Great that it has a battery that is stated as lasting ""ten years,"" but this watch will not likely last one tenth of that time period."
4,Great Value,"This is a great product. I was expecting it to look cheap (because it was) but I am really happy with the materials and quality. Super comfort fit. Will defenally recomend if you are looking for a cheap, reliable and durable watch."
4,Sony digital voice recorder review,Product was in perfect condition. Packaged was shipped in time and good quality. Very satisfied.
1,do not do it,"It is so very tiny you can't put a finger on the extremely tiny buttons I tried to stop the delivery 5 minutes after I purchased and Amazon and ANT whom I got it from all but ignored me and sure enough,,there it was anyway at my door...a week later I opened it, reluctantly...ugh..can not even hear the sound all the way up!!!"
2,"May be good, but Sony's sales policy is horrible","Sony may make good products, but when they renew a product, they don't always follow up on their former products and these may become useless.I bought a Sony ICD-R100 voice recorder when it was one of their most advanced products. It connected to my PC with a special connection cable so that I could transfer sound files easily. PCs changed, USB became generalized and the Sony cable didn't fit to my new PC. Sony didn't do anything to update hardware or software. They just wanted me to buy a new voice recorder.I think this is bad sales policy, and I recommend that you buy a product from a company that does not force you to buy new products all the time."
5,Great for lessons,"We are very pleased with our Sony Digital Voice Recorders. The one we purchased from you is our third, and we received the best price from Amazon. We use them to take to record music lessons. It is very helpful to hear the lesson again ""from the outside"" so to speak. My son uses his with his French horn and flute lessons, and I with my voice lessons. The sound quality is very good when not using the internal speaker. It is easy to plug into the computer or into my i-Pod speaker system. I have edited and downloaded some lessons onto my i-Pod itself. My husband uses his for dictation and uses it with ""Dragon-speak"" to transcribe into his Word program."
2,Not clear enough for my class- but was on wrong setting.,"I tried this for class, but it didn't pick up the professor's voice. It was probably due to the fact that I had the speed set on long- not meant for that type of recording. So this product may really be good, it's just I returned it already. Sorry for the low, misleading 2 stars, but I can't change that now."
4,very dependable dvr,"Have had for about a year now. Works great! Good value for money. I use it to create podcastgs for an Online course Iteach and it's a snap to create a file and upload to the Internet. What amazes me is the really small file size (mp3) I get after talking for about 1 hour.Finally, with respect to battery life, you can save power by pushing the ""hold"" button until the recorder turns off."
1,"Horrible, not what you expect from Sony","I don't know if the copy I purchased was bad, but the sound quality was just terrible. There was a hiss sound present during all recordings that really starts to drive you nuts when you want to listen to a recording. I was driven to purchase this recorder due to the Sony name and I became tired of using my MP3 player with a built in recorder as my conference recorder. Long story short, I'm going back to the MP3 player as my recorder. The initial purchase price was lower and the sound quality of the recordings is stellar in comparison."
4,Voice recorder,This voice recorder enables me to download lectures onto my pc and to make copies of them if I wish to. I can listen to myself rehearse a topic and critique it for improvement and clarity. It has been a great purchase and a good investment.
2,a disappointment,"I wanted to like this item. It is plastic, but sturdy and nicely styled, but it only seems well-designed when it is Not compared to the Olympus models. Fortunately, mine went through the washing machine, and I now have the great experience of the Olympus."
2,Not good for recording music,"This recorder is good for recording lecturers. It is not good for recording music. I bought one for my daughter for her piano lesson. The playback of the lecture (from either the device itself or after I downloaded it to PC) was good, but the sound quality of piano was terrible, with lots of noises. I ended up returning it to the store."
2,Good while it lasted,"This recorder does a pretty good job. When it actual records, that is. It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow because it never actually turns itself off from what I can tell. You can put it on hold, but it's never really off until you take the batteries out. So if you want to buy this, be sure to carry extra AAA batteries with you just incase. Although you should probably warned further that I had this recorder for a few months and one day it just all the sudden stoped working. Stone cold died on me. I put fresh batteries in, was about to use it and it just would not turn on. It's dead to this day, will not work, will not turn on, not even able to function when I plug it into the computer to get the audio I had recorded off of it.Basically, this is, in my opinion, not worth the price. You're much better off finding an Olympus digital recorder and spend the extra money on something that's more reliable and records at a better quality."
4,Soft Relaxing Instrumental,Pan Flute is one of my favourites. This Zamfir CD is my first and is just wonderful. Very soothing stuff.
2,Pan Flute Muzak,"I purchased this CD on the recommendations of other reviews on this site and found this effort by Zamfir to be one of his poorest. He's an excellent musician and I rate this two stars because of that, but otherwise it's a CD with mostly covers of tired songs that don't translate well to pan flute."
5,Excellent,"This was first purchase of a CD from Amazon. I was very leery about the condition it would be in. I didn't need to be,I had purchased two and they were both in excelent condition.I see now that I can always count on Amazon!!SincerelyGeorgia Ziller"
2,VMWARE,"Old fashioned, I bought this book because it was the more actual I found. Topics are described but no explained in deep. Just a short reference."
3,Not that good,"This David Banner CD, as well as the other ones he has put out, is not that good with the exception of a couple bangers. I am not feeling most of the songs on Certified mainly because they sound pretty much like his other songs on previous albums, and they kinda slow. His lyrics are not the best either.However, the songs that I do recommend are: Treat Me Like and Play. The ones I think are good are: On Everything and Certified, while Gangster Walk, Westside and X-ed are ok. The other ones I usually skip when I hear this cd."
5,"The reality of how to find, evaluate and obtain a winner",This book is a master businessman shareing the fruit of many years of experience and achievement. He takes you from the beginning to end of succesful business acqusition by maximizing the financial resources available in the market place and using the pschology that is in play when it is time to sell a profitable business.
3,A Nice Intro to the Subject,"This is a decent intro to the subject, but it lacks detail. The devil is in the detail as the old saying goes. If you want to learn how to buy a business you will need to learn a lot more than this short book has to offer."
1,Zzzzzzz!!,"I'd rather watch Twilight movie than read this book, which I presume was written by the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.....after he lost his personality. Seriously, terribly written, confusing, and impractical in a real business environment. I only read this for one of my MBA courses, otherwise I would have stopped at page 3. If you aren't being forced to read it, run screaming."
1,Not Particularly Helpful,This was a required text for a college course. It is a very dry read and although it outlines the principles of Action Research it was not as helpful or as reader friendly as some other texts that we used.
5,Photographic Gem,"What a delightful surprise this book! As a photo enthusiast I was not expecting much from such a simple , inexpensive book. But, was I wrong! The photos are gorgeous, very skillfully composed! And the light used in a very seductive way. The photos "" Delano "" and "" Light Carving "" in particular are real gems. Others, like "" Neon Ocean Drive"" has a subtle use of contrast that creates a very interesting mood.It's clear that after living in South Beach for so long he definetely knows his subject!And the printing also was another pleasant surprise, comparable to the more costly fine art photo books.Later I found out that Paul Clemence has a thriving photographic career in Miami. I have a feeling we'll still hear a lot about him!"
5,Great memories,"After moving away from Miami Beach it was great to find this book! It shows some of my favourite places there and in very cool photos.It totally sends me back, I can just see myself walking again on Ocean Dr., enjoying the breeze, the palm trees and the Art Deco. And the little texts with people's view on South Beach definetely reminded me of many conversations I had with the people I met down there. Kudos for the layout too; it is just as stylish as the photos themselves. Great job!"
4,Let's Go 2002 Israel is #1!,"I spent two weeks in Israel recently and brought along Fodor's and Let's Go travel books. I found Let's Go far better than Fodors because it had intricate details on the hotel properties, prices, border crossings into Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, etc., and tourist sites. Fodors did have more information on the history, politics, conflicts, art, and religion, but for a quick reference book to carry in a backpack, my vote goes to Let's Go."
4,The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus,"This book provided a thouightful review of the pertinent scriptural bases for the resurrection. It also explained alternate theories for what happened to Jesus. What I didn't expect was the author assuming that the reader was looking for arguments to convince others of the validity of the resurrection. Several times the author made the point that the reader could use this or that position that he had just laid out as an argument to persuade others of Jesus' resurrection. The book would have been stronger without these reminders. Nevertheless, the book is well worth having in one's reference library."
3,Wood pulp charmer,Robert Farrar's book is a 'coming of age' tale that is told with more than a soupcon of knowingly innocent charm.
5,Great for Bonding,My daughter (5 years old) loves this series of videos. We watch them together and it is great for bonding and communicating.
3,Good.......,"1.It`s fun....2.Pretty....3.Sweet.....4.Some of the music was bad.....5.Just ok....6.Pretty Bibble.....7.Beautiful graphics....8.Barbie is nice.....9.Magical......10.But........Well I like this movie,but it`s not good as the Princess and the Pauper and Rapuzel."
3,"Cute, but lacking","Of course, my 4 year old daughter loves this movie and can't get enough of it so far, but it is not the same quality as the other Barbie fairy tale movies (Princess and Pauper, Rapunzel, Swan Lake, and Nutcracker). The biggest disappointment for me as a parent is the bad attitude and slang teen talk of most of the characters. The main character is sweet and polite, but most of the others are not--at least at first. Just not great examples for young children who imitate everything. It is hard to go wrong with fairies, mermaids, and magic, so I'm sure your daughters will love it, too!"
3,My daughter likes it,"I'm not crazy about it, but as long as she likes it, I'm ok with it. Compared to what else there is out there for children her age to watch, it is ok."
5,It's Barbie,"It gets harder and harder to review Barbie dvds, as they are all pretty similar, but like all the others, this one still gets watched two years after being purchased. That is well worth 5 stars."
5,very good,i gess its good i only bought it cause of my sis and i didnt get to watch the whole thin becausemy internet was off but any thing other than that the movie was good!
1,A FAIRY EPIDEMIC???,"How scary! If your child is scared of Hospital and Medicaldramas, scary movies, and stuff like that, this movie does notbelong in your collection. Who knows what happens?"
2,Fair,"This wasnt my most favored barbie movie, I found it to be a bit slow paced and boring compared to most. I can't recall any particular negative content though so if you like barbie films it is worth at least watching this one."
4,"it's good,I guess","I watched this at my Nana's house,and the games were not that good.It was a little bit good.I want to see the Barbie and the magic of peagasus 3-d movie that is coming out next year and I think it will be much beter"
3,"Fun for the kids, but not as much for the parents.","This movie was not as much fun as previous Barbie movies. My husband and I have really enjoyed all of the others, but this one lacked something in the story.My daughter liked it, but she still prefers the other Barbie movies when she wants to watch one. She is 5 and said it was kind of boring.It's not that bad and we will watch it several times before my daughter outgrows it. A sign of a better movie is my husband going around reciting line and singing songs from Princess and the Pauper, and he's not the type to do that.People who hate the Barbie movies with a passion have obviously not watched them. Even the worst is better then most movies that have come out in the theater for kids."
4,A good barbie movie.,"It's a good barbie movie. For the price, if you have a Barbie fan in your home then I would definitely buy it. That being said, I don't think it's the BEST barbie movie out of all of them but it is still very cute and my daughter loves it."
2,"Disappointing, but worth it for 'Someday'","After the universal acclaim of 'Gap Band IV', their 5th was a bit of a disappointment. The uptempo tracks have a tendency to 'rock' instead of 'funk'. However, if you're a fan of the Wilson brothers more laid back grooves, then this album will hold a few pleasant surprises for you. The final track 'Someday' is a classic! It was a big hit in the UK but surprisingly it doesn't appear on any of the compilation albums. It is without a doubt one The Gap Band's most inspired moments"
3,Pretty Good,this Album didn't hit like the one in 82 but it still has moments such as Party Train.their Synth sound influenced the WHole New Jack Swing Era.also Charlie WIlsons Vocals.this album started sounding like their other albums a little too much so here but this was still worthy of a listen or two.
2,Much as it pains me --,"It pains me to not recommend any TMBG album, but I have to disagree with consensus on this one. I liked this version of ""Why does the sun shine?"" unti I heard the faster, more rocked out version on ""Severe Tire Damage."" I liked the sparsely instrumented ""Whirlpool,"" until I heard the 10-times better original. ""Jessica"" is fine, but not a compelling reason to buy an album. ""Spy"" is on John Henry, identical except for the improv at the end.I would only recommend this to those who want everything TMBG's ever done. Kinda bugs me that this one is still available, but the GREAT EP's for ""The Guitar"" and ""Istanbul"" are not to be had."
5,Interesting piece of music,"Although their raucous live version on ""Severe Tire Damage"" is superior to this version it's still fun to listen to this album. The original version of ""Spy"" is here, but the real treasure is their cover of the Meatpuppets song ""Whirlpool"" with the spare saxophone supporting the vocals. The imagery and wackyness of that song, in particular, are what makes it interesting. It's one of my favorite songs by TMBG of all time."
4,Good buy!,"Not a bad purchase, You get everything you need to enjoy your crab or lobster. Be careful, when your butter gets really hot and low it will begin to splat hot butter on you and your table. Just keep it 1/3 full or turn it off once you get near the end of your meal or low on butter. This box come with everything you need to enjoy a nice seafood dinner."
4,A series to tickle your funny bone,"This is a strange and funny show that will amuse viewers with its bizarre melding of early Kyoto and modern day technology. More of an heir apparent to ""Ranma 1/2"" than the epic ""Inuyasha"" could ever be, this mindless but entertaining series is highly recommended to comedy fans and those who enjoy switching off their brains as they watch anime."
2,forgettable,"I bought this ova because the character art was reportedly from Rumiko Takahashi. Maybe the original sketches were, but the animation is subpar. The story is threadbare, childish and repetitious, and the relationship to japanese legends is lame pretense. Only the music sounds good-but there are only a few seconds of it. Sorry."
2,"Good premise, not so good execution.","I had heard a bit about this OVA when I began watching it. The list of people involved was impressive, (How can you beat Character designs by Rumiko Takahashi?) and the story sounded great as well. Three daughters of Shinsengumi swordsmen protecting a town against monsters and demons, all while the townspeople resist the westernization of their village.By the second episode, though, I was beginning to have my doubts. Each episode involves the girls fighting some sort of monster (After going through a stock-animation ""shielding up"" sequence.) and revealing a tiny bit about their past, with very little to hold them all together but a side-story about a necklace.In the end, I lost interest in this anime and stopped watching it about ten minutes in to the last episode. The only true bright spots about this OVA are the character designs and the theme song. This is one DVD you can easily pass up."
2,Oh Why GOD!,"an anime of great potential wasted. Dirty Pair + one goes to the Meji Restoration. While the techinal quailty of the DVD is good, the story owes more to the Dirty Pair idea of girls are chaos in action. not to metion the kommi reconstrustion company is alive and well in this past era. Plots are a streight line and character development is non exsistant and the cat demons has some of the better lines.On the other hand if your young enough not to care about that or if your in the right frame of mind it can quaility as a gulity pleasure."
3,Disappointment after Failer,"Failer is one of my top five favorite albums of all time, and I eagerly awaited this follow-up for two years. The care and inspiration that Edwards put into her debut is absent here. Don McLeese said it a little kinder than I would have, but hits the nail on the head: a few good cuts, but way too much of the same-sounding stuff to round out the disc. The production and mixing of the album don't help engender it either -- the vocals are too dominant, and the drums are so overwhelming (not to mention simplistic and uninspired -- human, or drum machine??) that the punch of the guitar and bass found on Failer is non-existant. Who had control of sequencing the tracks? Obviously not someone who wanted to keep the listener engaged through the entire album. Overall, a great disappointment after Failer and the wait. I give it 3 stars over 2 because I'm hoping it grows on me, and I hope Kathleen's next picks up the ball."
2,Fails,"I was eagerly anticipating Kathleen's new album, but it seems a little too country-pop. A lot of the songs have simular-sounding verses to te ones on her debut cd. I'd say the only ""interesting"" tracks are Back To Me, Old Time Sake, Independent Theif, Good Things, and Summerlong. I miss the edge to the songs on her debut cd Failer. The guitar olos were so awesome n that cd and they are strongly lacking on this cd."
1,Failer #2,"Based on the video for Back To Me and a few short clips from the other songs, I gave Kathleen Edwards the benefit of the doubt. Now it's all cleared up. Back To Me is the only song I like. I can't fast forward through the rest fast enough. What was I thinking? I have to wonder and that's all I'll do about her first cd ""FAILER""."
2,Insipid lyrics and lousy voice,"I got this album because it was favorably reviewed in Acoustic Guitar magazine.First, there isn't much acoustic guitar on this. It's a lot of effect driven electric and some slide. The guitar playing is uninspired.Next, the lyrics are laughably bad. My daughter and I literally laughed out loud at several points.Also, the tunes are pretty tuneless.But worst of all, her voice is horrid. She's out of key almost all the time (and with a monotone tuneless tune, to boot)."
4,When Does Her Next One Come Out?,"It's only 4-stars here because 5 is perfect and rarely is anything perfect. But Kathleen Edwards is a fantastic artist - and this disc is more than I ever expected following an amazing ""Failer"" debut! Enough of the Lucinda Williams comparisons - I love Lucinda Williams, but Kathleen Edwards is original in her style and music - extraordinary song writing and a haunting voice! My 5-star songs here are Pink Emerson Radio, Old Time Sake, and Copied Keys (which grabbed me on the first listen, before it even finished). If you own Failer...buy this - if you don't - buy both!"
3,check back later,"I completely agree with all the reviewers who find her voice, style, and artistry promising great things to come. Clearly she has an enormous talent. As I start out listening from the beginning, I think wow this is good, really good. Further through I start thinking along the lines of what others here have said - gee it kind of all sounds the same, but then musically it's good enough I don't mind that so much. Finally I get most of the way through and I just turn it off. There's a theme, and it's not something I want to feed my soul repeatedly. Her songs are not just about relationship aches - those kind of songs can be truly great. In the end she just sounds bitter and angry and like she's not really getting over it. There is no GRACE in this music. Maybe she just needs to get a little older and have some kind of spiritual epiphany, acquire a little balance - then all that talent might go somewhere."
2,Back to average,"ALL the ingredients of 'Failer' (a CD I really like!) are there on 'Back to Me'. And they are used in EXACTLY the same way. Sounds like the same dish. I would not have mind that, but 'Back to Me' sound so predictable, so 'uninspired'. Gone are the memorable hooks and melody lines and freshness of 'Failer'. Give it a spin, before you buy it."
4,An over-elaborated album,"Goodbye and Hello is usually regarded as the best of Tim Buckley... I'm reserved about that. Lyrically speaking it's excellent, and TIm's singing is brillant too. But The over-complex arrangement seems not fit and sometimes makes the should-be benign song sounds loud. As a result, it lost the key merit of the simple yet brilliant debut ""Tim Buckley"". It could be regarded as a Transitional record... Of course,despite this shortcomings there are lots of gems. e.g. ""Pleasant Street"",""Once I was"", and ""morning glory"". Still worth 4 stars."
2,Not for the squeemish,"I first became acquainted with Tim Buckley's music in the early 70's when I was a disc jockey for the AM radio station at the college I was attending. Buckley has a way of ""sneaking up"" on you when listening to his music. Lots of his music begins with soft introductions and then, like a split personality, changes into a wildman. The first time I auditioned one of his toons, I almost fell off my swivel chair! It was almost like an audible version of ""Friday the 13th, Part 1"".Buckley has a spine tingling way of entertaining you. He is bizarre, strange, wierd, unusual and most of all quite effective in scaring the ""willies"" out of many listeners. Personally, I don't like him, but if you'd like an audible roller coaster ride, then by all means buy this or any one of his albums. But if you're the type that is faint of heart... well, beware!"
1,GOODBYE AND HELLO BY TIM BUCKLEY,NOT ABLE TO REVIEW DVD WAS NOT WORKING. I GOT ANOTHER TO REPLACE AND THAT ONE DID NOT WORK EITHER
2,LATE arrival,Arrived in mid-January for a Christmas gift for my husband. Fortunately he received other gifts in time for the holiday.
5,finding old vinal on cd,i had no idea that amazon had so many old vinal selections on cd.in perfect condition with same old album covers for the cd. happy happy joy joy
3,Reproduction values not entirely up to par...,"The stories and artwork in this volume are classic, but I find it disappointing that a substantial chunk of the book suffers from poor, muddy reproduction of the linework. This is not a minor point since (1) Byrne's artwork is detailed, and easily suffers from dropouts and blotchiness if it isn't reproduced carefully and (2) the original publication dates of these comics wasn't so long ago that there isn't any reason not to put out a top quality job. Fortunately, only a portion of the reprints in this edition suffer from this problem, and the other volumes in this series have crisp reproduction throughout (as of this writing, Volume 5 is the most recent volume to be published)."
5,First rate,A very good book review journal with a much different take than the New York Review of Books (also excellent)and I particularly like have that difference in viewpoint not only from a cultural and geographical perspective but because the educational systems emphasize different things and I enjoy benefiting form that added value.
3,not bad,"This product looks great but it just doesn't seem as sturdy as nurf bars are. They bolts on to sheet metal not to the frame, so when the spring is fully stretched you can still feel the step give a little bit as the sheet metal bends. I catch myself avoiding steping on the step which defeats the whole purpose of why I got them. I drive a 2008 dodge ram so I can't say how they work on any other make, but regardless they will still attatch to sheet metal not the frame."
4,Memories,"These songs are great, and brought back memories of my youth. I would suggest getting this album for those who grew up in the 60's."
5,"Great songs, great sound!","I have owned this CD for many years, and I still play it from time to time because the songs are so good and the artist is so talented. One great thing about it is that the digital transfer is so good. The songs sound as if they were recorded just yesterday, so clear and with excellent dynamics. Even though one reviewer mentioned that there is a song that has a different ""mix"" from the original, I did not detect that in any of the many hits that I am so familiar with. Indeed, since this CD actually has 2-cds of songs on it, I also discovered some great songs by Lesley Gore that I did not know exist. While most CDs I own have only one or 2 good songs, this one has song after song that is so much fun to listen to. In fact I cannot find even one song here that I do not like. (Obviously, I like melodic pop!)"
4,Where are the bloopers?,"Amazon is not the only place where the ""bloopers"" are listed as part of the DVD set. ""Political Missteps"" is also listed on the DVD set box, but I haven't been able to find them on the disks. If someone knows where they are hiding, I'd appreciate being enlightened."
3,This is so so DVD,Not too interesting. All people are pretentious in the DVDs. Well maybe it's just my own taste.
5,Best show on TV,West Wing was one of the top 5 best shows ever on TV. This episode was definitely one of the best and an A+
5,I'd rate it 10 stars but 5 is the most Amazon offers,"Awesome, superb, flawless, brilliant ... the English language is a wonderful thing but it does not have enough superlatives to describe the masterpiece that is The West Wing. Anyone remotely interested in poltics and public policy must watch this. Watching it over and over again is a guilty pleasure and so much more worthwhile than all those Star Trek re-runs (sorry Klingon dudes, it's true). The West Wing has seven series in all and they are all highly recommended."
3,damaged,"The west wing had damaged sections on at least two discs. My player skipped over it but they still were damaged.,,"
5,This Classic show hits it's peak and stride.,"The Third season was The West Wing at it's best. Intricately woven story arcs and a set of characters fleshed out with love and honesty. Seasons 1 and 2 were great because of the earnestness of the writing, directing and acting. Everyone gave it a little extra. By season 3 we began to anticipate the characters and their actions. But instead of simply complying in character, they breathed new vitality. Donna became more than an assistant with Sexual Tension growing between her and Josh. Toby and his inner demons were realized. This is simply the best written and realized TV program in many years and belongs in the Pantheon of All Time Great TV programs."
3,Mediocre at best,I don't know about anyone else but I found that this product distributed by Warner Home Video was very lacking. I received two different copies from Amazon and neither one had the 'Political Missteps' that the box implied. I have no fault with Amazon; I find fault with Warner Home Video for distributing such a shoddy product to such a quality distributor like Amazon. I let Warner Home Video know of my dissatisfaction and I encourage anyone to do the same. The West Wing is too good a show to be distributed in this lackluster way.
5,Wife is hooked.,"I gave my wife this for Christmas. I know shes loves this show - I can't get any TV time, because she's always watching it. :-)"
5,MOST EXCELLENT,One of the BEST television programs ever produced! Aaron Sorkin has to be one of the best writers around. Superb!
4,Great show!,"We're hooked. It's good TV, as long as you can get past the very liberal opinion of the writers, actors and [probably] most of the viewers as well. They lead a horribly busy life and I can't imagine ever working there. Great tv."
5,Jed Bartlett for President,I miss quality TV like this. I enjoyed the series when it first aired and enjoying once more. I would highly recommend all seasons of West Wing.
2,Issac and Ishmael - Portion missing indeed!,"As the other poster mentioned, there are 10 minutes missing from the ""Issac and Ishmael"" episode, which includes a good section with Toby and Sam, and some integral plot developments with the secondary storyline. It's very annoying to purchase the episode and find key parts missing. The entire show is just over 30 minutes. Why would they cut 10 minutes out?I wasted money buying this shortened version, so I ended up buying a full version on iTunes for just $1.00 more."
5,Amazing,"I have never really been a fan of garage rock. When Veni Vidi Vicious came out, i absolutely hated it. How could a band who had lame songwriting and big egos be any good? Well, i've given T-Hives a listen, and i was completely blown away. I have new found respect for The Hives, and I have listened to their earlier albums. They're great. And like I said before, T-Hives is no exception. Song after song comes a simple but raucous sound that if you actually listen to it, it is quite sophisticated. Their songwriting has obviously improved, and their egos actually seem charming. Two Timimg Touch and Broken Bones has to be one of the catchiest punk songs ever written. T-Hives shows that The Hives are more than just a garage rock band who will come and go. They'll be here for a long time to come."
5,Saw the Hives Live after taking this dive,"Let me tsart by saying that this is my favorite band ever so this reveiw may seem a little biased.While not as Fast as Barely Legal or headturning as Veni Vidi Vicious, Tyrannousaurus Hives is by far the Hives most polised album.It still thrills, with my favorite songs being Abra Cadaver, Missing Link, and Antidote.And for those of you who enjoy this, make sure you go an support The Hives next time they go on tour. I was lucky enough to see them at the Warfield in San Francisco earlier this month, and I have to say the CD doesn't do them justice, they are mindblowing live. All the energy from a song like Abra Cadaver is increased ten fold live, and Howlin Pelle puts on quite a show, even addressing us Bay Areanan as ""God-Damn Hippies"" for most of the show.Make sure you support these guys, they are for real."
5,Hives rock motor-city style.,"The latest Hives record is an improvement on their previous releases, the production is great, the songs are stronger throughout, and the vocals are much more focused and intense. Lacking an ultra-cool single like ""Hate to say I told you so"" does nothing to tarnish this extremely strong album with at least six songs that should be singles, (but won't be in today's jock-rock climate.) If you've never heard from or of the Hives they are a Swedish ""garage-punk"" band that blasts out a kind of MC5, Stooges, 60's styled retro-rock. Tyrannosaurus Hives proves that the Hives just might live up to the ""next big thing"" talk that surrounded them when they broke through to a more mainstream audience, and unlike the Strokes, White Stripes, and the highly overrated Vines, The Hives have significantly improved their sound."
2,Hard to listen too,"I love this band but I think they went overboard on the hyped up, digitally distorted sound of this album. In the old days of punk and garage bands there was always distortion but it was analog and not digital.....a big difference. I think a lot of people will find that they won't play this album as often as they first thought they might because there are frequencies in this record that just don't make you feel good. Give me analog distortion any day. Favorite songs ""Abra Cadaver"", ""Two-Timing Touch And Broken Bones"", ""Walk Idiot Walk"" and ""No Pun Intended"""
4,I've got the hives (literally),"I picked up this Hives album; and I had a chance to listen in depth now; I must say, its quite infectious. THe most readily listenable thing on there is two timing touch- and thenthe other songs grow on you more slowly.At times there is a digital quality to the punk music here; a ratcheted up drum quality; there is some really catchy frenetic quality to it; and although there isn't remotely the depth or tonal quality of say, the Strokes, its still fantastic and a must have for your New millenium sort-a-punk CD collection"
3,Incredibly mediocre,"My heading says everything about this album- it's simply not very good. Every frickin' track has the annoying singer yelling as loud as he possibly can over the, I'll admit, at times pretty good melodies. But, as I wasn't surprised to find out, they didn't write their own songs! If you look inside the booklet, it says that every song is written by some guy named Randy Fitzsimmons who is not a member of the band. Sorry, I just can't stand bands that don't write their own songs. That's the main reason I gave this album such a low rating. Maybe that's not fair. There were a few songs on it I kind of liked like ""No Pun Intended,"" ""A Little More for Little You,"" and ""Dead Quote Olympics,"" showing the Hives do have some talent of their own. In fact, I was going to give this album two stars, but I think I'll make it three for the few songs I do like. I don't think this album is worth what you have to pay for it, though."
1,So Derivative...and Out of TUNE!,"Ugh. Bands like this make money while bands like The Dickies languish in obscurity. All this modern ""music"" is nothing but blatant derivative junk. This album is heinous as it steals from the best and yet manages to rend every note to shreds. If I want to listen to Devo, Dickies, Residents etc., I'll spin THOSE albums. The problem today is that consumers cannot bear to listen to albums repeatedly, so they search for replication of the things they're used to. Therefore, derivation takes over and bands like The Hives gain fame. Ick. Folks, just purchase the old stuff--the classic stuff--you will never go wrong. Moreover, listen to it until you know the music inside-out, to where you can anticipate each note, each lyrical inflection. Just say no to the junk that clutters the racks and hopefully the music industry will get a clue. We'll still find the bands like Nirvana but in the meantime we can avoid garbage like The Hives. Phew!"
5,Watch Out!,"I totally feel connected to the cat who saw these guys July 24, 2004 on David Letterman. These guys blew me away. Their lead singer is just awesome. He totally reminded me of Iggy Pop with all that energy, the camera closeups and his honesty. I loved it. I haven't seen somebody swing a mic like that since watching some old Who back from the early 70's! The only band thats given me the willies like that on TV were the Foo-Fighters on Letterman as well about 5 years ago. The Hives rock and rock well!!"
4,Dude it's a Manic Episode!,"To mania or not to mania,that is the question! Yes my fellow punk rockers ""The Hives"" rocks a** and if you simply disgree with my opinion i advise you to listen to one of their tracks,just make sure you have your speakers turned high,and i assure you if you don't feel like there is a bubbly Tyrannosaurus hopping with you,just try to jump & fly! Yes everybody it's a rockin punkin album,and those lyrics,i don't know where on earth do they come up with such disoriented lyrics,but i know when you're feeling low and you want to hyper your senses,just play this album. I mean after Franz Ferdinand's ""take me out"", i thought they'll never be a good punk rock song but then i heard The Hives'""Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones"" and I'm like,wait,what was that? then came ""Walk Idiot Walk"" and I was like,no wait,seriously what was that?? Then I bought the album and thought this is pure mania,like awesome music you maniacs,ditch the lithium,get The Hives. Batteries not included..."
5,Great Album,My second favorite Hives album behind The Black and White album. If you enjoy any type of rock and roll music please buy this.
4,knock em out,"this is a great work out cd...its fast, high energy, and serious fun. it lags toward the end though and the screaming diabolical scheme i cant even listen to. Overall its fabulous."
2,high energy & a good sound,"I got this album after hearing Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones. I was hoping that every song had as many cool hooks. Abra Cadabra and Love in Plaster are ok tunes but nothing too memorable.The energy of the album is high but the problem is it starts feeling like a wash of white noise with trite riffs and silly lyrics. As much as I like Two-Timing Touch and Broken Bones the guitar riffs are right off of I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone"" by the Monkees.There are plenty of bands imitating the garage sound of the 60's with varying success, certainly the Strokes seem to be leading the pack. From all the hype about this album I think it's dud that lacks originality. but it's not the worse thing I've ever heard. ;)"
2,"Good design, sloppy execution","I received this lamp and am disappointed in poor workmanship. The jar is placed off center on the base and it has large gaps between two parts of the jar. In addition, the coloring and glazing are sloppy leaving gray areas around and underneath the jar.The color is beautiful though and the lamp is large and makes a statement in my room. Too bad you can clearly see poor workmanship close up."
3,arrived damaged,"1. the lamp arrived damaged, the socket had been ripped off of the top of the lamp before it was even packed and was entirely missing. The remnant metal base was mangled. We had to take the lamp apart and install a new socket from the hardware store.2. the picture does not accurately display what the lamp really looks like. The lamp is handsome enough but several more accurate pictures would be proper.3. the listed height of 20"" is wrong, it is 23"" tall. The amazon listing should accurately describe all three dimensions."
5,George B-NH,"Just received this hat and I am very pleased with it's warmth and style.I have had many comments about it's style. Suggest you get the XL size, as it can be a little snug for the regular size head. Buy one you will not be disappointed."
3,Live and More is really Live and Less,"With the deletion of MacArthur Park Suite, a 17 minute masterpiece, this CD is not worth purchasing. If you can get a hold of the original vinyl 2lp set you'll know what I mean. Why would any record company remove the gem of this release? Just think - someone consciously made that decision.RJM"
3,This misleading CD is not the original vinyl album version!!,"Having owned the original vinyl album, this CD is missing the all important 18 minute studio recording of the ""MacArthur Park Suite"".Even though there is a disclaimer in fine print on the inside jacket explaining why the ""Suite"" had to be removed and replaced with a numbing slow-tempo track, the record company was wrong in releasing this CD with the original jacket cover from the vinyl. Without opening the jewel box plastic wrapping, one would never know why the original live and studio recorded tracks were not faithfully reproduced.However, in my opinion, this CD contains the greatest live disco recording ever: on a scale similar to Peter Frampton's ""Frampton Comes Alive"" 1976 album.If this CD was a true reproduction of the vinyl, I would have rated it 5 out of 5 stars."
5,Donna Summers Live and More,I was very pleased with my purchase. The CD was in excellent condition and arrived when promised. I will shop again from this seller.djleone
1,This needs a MAJOR reissue,Okay...this needs to be REISSUED like YEsterday...and WITH The Missing Macarthur Park suite and the ornigal art work..grrrrrrrr...
3,background noise,"of course, is a concert, what am i gonna expect but background noise & she talking to death, but i love donna summer & had to have it."
5,A Year And A Half In The Life Of Metallica Part 2,"If you want to start to be a fan on Metallica they say that the best album to buy would be the Black album. I agree. This video has the highs and lows of the live shows that they did in that time. It features an excellent live version of Harvestor Of Sorrow and Kirk in a pair a red underpants. If you like Metallica this is probably the best buy you can ever make. It is funny, crazy but great. Enjoy"
3,Mixed Bag,"Even a weak Nanci Griffith album is better than many artist's best ones, and ""Blue Roses"" is no exception.There are some great cuts here. ""Wouldn't That Be Fine,"" ""Battlefield,"" ""St. Teresa of Avila,"" ""Not My Way Home,"" ""I'll Move Along"" and ""She Ain't Going Nowhere."" Even her cover of ""I Fought The Law"" (with the Crickets) is surprisingly sturdy.But at the same time there are some tracks that don't really measure up to her previous work. Most notably a new version of one of her all time best songs ""Gulf Coast Highway."" This song was recorded to perfection on her ""Little Love Affairs"" album, and all the version here does is remind one of how much better the original was.All in all a good, and frequently underrated effort, but hardly the cream of Nanci's crop."
2,Poorest entry in Nanci's list of great CDs,"I am sorry to say that Nanci Griffith is becoming to sound like a parady of herself! The songs themselves are not to bad, but there really is not one among them to really grab you, as there have been in her past efforts. Perhaps she SHOULD give up music for a while as the rummors have reported."
2,Nothing New. Just a Micro-USB charger,This item isn't anything special. It's just a Nokia Micro-USB charger. The same one that ships with the N97. Better off getting it from eBay.
4,I'm spooked,"As a resident of the Greater St. Louis area, I was immediately drawn into the stories in this book. I was REALLY weirded out to know that the Book House, which is a store that I have visited in the past, is supposed to be haunted.The fact that the book didn't contain any ""pictures"" of ghosts lost it a point."
3,Not many layers on this onion,"Despite an excellent lead-off track, most of the album sounds like outtakes or studio improvisations. For any mortal group this would be a decent effort but for Ozrics it falls far short of their best work that is multilayered and constantly changing. Also, John (flute) appears to be entirely absent. Even so, Steep is a must-have although at 3:09 on the short side for these guys. Also included is a studio version of Spice Doubt (appearing here as Space Out, but not too different from the version on the webcast album ""Spice Doubt""), and Kick 98, a remixed version of Kick Muck with different keyboard parts but the same guitar riff as the version on ""Pungent Efflugent"" (which in turn is that same as the version on ""Sliding Gliding Worlds"" minus the 2 min ambient ending). The album is 45 min, also on the short side for Ozric."
2,"Disappointing, but still, Ozrics!","Revamped 80's era classics with different names. Much more dark and flakey than anything previously released, perhaps the least innovative. Kick 98, for example, is Kick Muck with more techno-effects. Still, if you have an Ozrics collection, add this, worth it for the cover graphics alone. Hopefully the group will release something beyond where Waterfall Cities left off. Nice background music, but sadly not so stonking."
4,Interesting,"Fred is recruited by Wessex Academy after failing Senior year, and deciding to take it over again. He doesn't have the money that most of the other students have, but the faculty want him for basketball. Fred soon meets Noah, Sunday, Mackenzie, and Allison. Four spoiled rich kids who have never heard the word ""no."" Soon Fred is thrown into a school and world full of lies, cheating, scam, and more.This is an excellent book that all fans of the movie ""Cruel Intentions would enjoy."
5,Noah is my god!,"Okay so let's face it some of these kids have issues...but don't all us kids this age have some sort of issue? I mean drugs and relationships are things we're dealing with, and besides the whole gambling mafia conspiracy thing this was a book I could really relate to. Which is saying something because of all the ""literature"" they shove down our throats at school. In my mind it is a must read for all teenagers.My favorite character is Noah, despite his obvious issues I think that next to Fred he IS the most mentally stable person at the school for one reason, he understands how the system works and why things happen. He also has his own ways to abuse the system I can't wait to read #3!!!"
5,Great!!,"I'm not sure what Amazonian was saying about these being generic brands, but maybe they changed to the legitimate ones afterwards. I ordered 8 applicators total (4 sets of 2 pack) and they all come with the Meguiar's packaging and imprint on the foam pads. They're clean and seems to be brand new. A great buy for anyone looking to wax their vehicle without worrying about the quality of the products you are using."
5,AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM by Alexander Pope,"My English Professor Mark Kobler wrote on Classroom board; ""An Essay on Criticism"" by Alexander Pope (English poet c. 1725*)True Ease in Writing comes from Art, not chance,As those move easiest who have learned to dance,'Tis not enough no Harshness gives offense,The sound must seem an echo to the sense.* Actual published date was Tuesday, May 15, 1711. Mr. Kobler remembered parts of the essay by heart.I was so impressed I ordered the book through Amazon. Here it is from page 18 line 14 - 17.I have another jewel, ""The imitation of Christ"" Re-edited into modern English by W Raynal, OSB 1872through Amazon. Thank you Amazon and generous sellers (offer).Kang."
2,nothing like his first 2 books,"I hoped for the best when I bought this, but was very disappointed. The heroine, a Type A successful American brat, never won my empathy until the last 10 pages (of a book over 600), and then it was too late. The plot dragged on and on and on. The information about vodka held this thing together...don't waste your money."
1,Let the action begin!,"But it never really does. There is not much compelling action at all.Or maybe the problem is that the characters are of little interest. Who cares about them?I started this thinking it to be in the fun genre of DeMille, Grisham, or Follett. Wrong.What is of interest is the glimpse into vodka and the situation at the fall of the Soviet Union. But one gains that understanding very quickly, in the first few pages.If one is looking for a nice, quality, action sort of read, this is not the book to select."
2,Fair,"A relative multitude of storylines and a colorful backdrop are almost enough to save ""Vodka"" from being what it is, another generic entry in the commercial thriller/intrigue genre."
4,Too Long In Exile,"I will be brief. When I was in college in the late 70s we thought these guys really rocked. Their female vocalist reminds one possibly of Heart's Wilson sisters, although with considerable more vocal power. The band's cover versions of several of the theme songs from Clint Eastwood's ""spaghetti westerns"" are real good, real loud, but the tune that I have been searching the net for, for years is the one that I remember the best screaming from my dorm room stereo, is ""Fascination"". Babe Ruth's music may be a little dated now, but I'm sure glad someone out there thought they were worthy of CD rebirth."
1,this is also not what i wanted,"now the logo changed to mi. when I ordered it, it still shows IBM and I received the white and blue one. It's okay as I don't really care the brand. besides, it should bare the same features as the IBM one as it was posted. but after I see the real mouse today, I feel angry. The mouse only has PS/2 interface, no USB connector at all. I won't be able to use it for my laptop!! So it has no relationship with that IBM mouse and don't have the feature as what the logo shows."
5,wierdness,"Describing this music is very difficult, but I'll try. Nico sings, and on all tracks but the last one done a cappella, plays an instrument called the harmonium, which apparantly is a cross between a theramin (the wierd instrument in ""Good Vibrations"" and amny spooky effects in movies) and an accordian. Her voice is thick, expressive yet monotone, and the European accents show through. I'm not sure of the standards for the harmonium, but her playing seems to these untrained ears to be very proficient. John Cale, her old Velvet Underground cohort, adds some great noises here and there. The music is very human, not really rock but unbelievably powerful, and VERY unique. Stories of hopelessness, love, dead insects...this is a one of a kind. mandatory purchase."
5,"An odd new meaning or the word ""classic""","Taking in to account that a cd mostly made over 40 years ago continues to draw the strongest attraction from us, ""The Marble Index"" most likely should be called a classic. However, while listening to this works, encoutering the subtlety and force of Nico's voice and the richness of her compositions, the variety in sounds and atmospheres created, one is convinced that such an adjective would not serve propperly to this complex cd. If it were a classic, today's music should offer us a completely different outlook. ""The Marble Index"" remains a ouvre of the margins, an obscure work still waiting to be thoroughly listened at. Let us."
5,The Marble Index,"Cold and stark as the marble of the title. How many albums will you be listening to 30 years after you first bought them ? This is a journey to the edge where it leaves you with no way home. Each sound cuts through the rubbish around you and leaves you bleeding in the snow. If you want instant satsifaction this album is not for you. If you want something which will last, buy it. If you have it on vinyl, get it for the extra two tracks. Join me in the evening of light, and stay."
1,So horrible,"Too bad I couldn't give this 0 stars....I've never heard a more horrible, depressing album in my life. If you enjoy listening to a woman with a awful voice speak in confusing codes and metaphors without any type of beat structure or musical talent, this album is for you.100% nausea; I can't believe I suffered through this review."
2,How can this average 5 stars,I bought this because i like the velvet undergrond and nico and chelsele girl so i wanted a another Nico cd. But what made those 2 cds great is that she did not write any of the songs except the one i usually skip on chesle girl it was a preasure then. You probably already know that she slept with most or all of the people who wrote and performed with her on chesle girls and this cd. I listen to this cd 2 times to give a chance it is ok background music but it is dull and boring most of the songs sound the same but the one about her son is good and moving but that is it.And by the way Nico thought later on that her early work was boring she was right.
1,not a good choice,dosent work like the same type of noise maker a friend bought at Walgreens... don't buy it111
4,FARM MECHANIZATION HANDBOOK (Purchased on 04/17/2009),The service was very good and the book is a valuable old edition which I was delighted to be able to source.
1,"BUY Plus, Also, Too; He's Drunk; Smallmouth","I was an early fan of Scrawl so I'm not going to apologize to anyone for saying this CD is bad. There's one good song: the ""at the piano"" version of Story Musgrave. He Cleaned Up is OK. The remainder meanders around, at best it's not memorable but sadly most tunes rate a rapid fast-forward.Good buys = Plus, Also, Too; He's Drunk; Smallmouth. Not this."
2,"Convenient, but messy","Coffee quality is fine. The ""go"" cups can be very convenient.However, the base of the machine, where the carafe sits, is very slick with no indentations to help you seat the carafe properly. If the carafe is even slightly out of place, coffee will go EVERYWHERE. I've cleaned up after this thing more times than I can count.The top of the carafe is also poorly designed for pouring, and drips and spills a great deal. I wouldn't buy this product again."
2,"Not hot enough, leaks a lot!","The coffee tastes fine. The unit is still working. The carafe concept is good, as the coffee never gets that burned flavor you get when using a burner-based coffee maker. However, the unit doesn't have a pause and brew function. It leaks...a lot...onto the unit, onto my counter, it even leaks after brewing has stopped (fyi this is with a half filled water reserve so that isn't the problem). Secondly, the coffee doesn't come out hot enough and after about an hour (definitely after 2 hours) you have to microwave your coffee. I have had it for about a year and have not been satisfied. I am looking for one that doesn't leak (very tired of wiping up the mess all the time) and makes & keeps the coffee hot."
5,my favorite sacto hardcore band,this cd shows an example of the music that this is one of the best bands in the scene out there. End of days is classic hardcore. This cd is a good example of great hardcore.
5,Pleased,I installed this modem to avoid having a phone line connected directly to a stand-alone control system. The setup was quick and the modem has worked flawlessly through several hundred calls and a significant lightning storm.
2,didn't hold up to Aikido training,"I have owned 2 of these Hakama for Aikido training. I bought the first one about 4 years ago. In less than a year of training the seam connecting the bottom right side of the koshita separated. I repaired it myself. A few months later the same seam, this time on the left bottom side of the koshita, separated. I repaired it myself. Months later, seams on the himo began to separate. I have a cheap $25 spare hakama that held up much better.I thought I was just rough on my hakama, until I recently purchased another one of these. I had the hakama for less than 10 hours of training when the seam at the bottom of the koshita separated. I sent an e-mail to returns@e-bogu.com approximately 2 weeks ago asking for a refund for this failed hakama. I have not received a response.The only positive I can say is that I liked the feel of the material. The downside of the material is that it didn't retain the pleats as well as I would like, regardless of how carefully I folded it."
1,trash,"Surprising someone would go to all the effort to write such a boring book. He seemed to have his heart in it when he talks about the bears, but when it includes people, he loses it. I threw it in the trash where it belongs. I normally recycle everything."
4,FUN TO SHARE WITH THE GIRLS,"Me and the girls play this game at our birthday club when we meet once a month, Some very good questions are in there and some make you say who wrote this but over all a good table conversation game."
4,Good Conversation Starts But Safe,"I ordered this for my best friend's bachelorette party thinking it would be the perfect start to our lingerie party. While most questions were fun (though a few were boring) it was a lot ""safer"" than I thought it'd be. We didn't have body parts or strippers at the party but I figured a naughty and personal questions would be enough. There were maybe 10 questions out of the whole pack that fit what I was looking for. It did help a group of girls who didn't know each other very well open up for the night though. I'd recommend this game, but I'd use it as an opening for a more risque game like ""I've Never"""
5,Great Idea!,I've played with a couple of these Table Topics Conversation Cards and love them! I got these for a bridesmaid's weekend and we had a blast! You learn all kinds of things about each other you never knew. Great for getting to know a couple of the women since we were meeting for the first time. Lots of fun cards but some are more serious and really make you think. Thinking of picking up some of the other sets.
3,"If you are an American skinhead, you may get bored.","Why? Because it's about a young skinhead and his crew in late-60's England. They are MAD about football (soccer) and I honestly can't think of anything more boring than 13 year olds hero worshipping some team playing some sport that never fully entered the American conciseness. I wanted to read about the music, the brawling and the boozing. I got very little of that. However I did keep reading and read it pretty quick - it kept my interest enough to turn the page and I kept thinking Joe Hawkins was on the next page. He wasn't. I was looking for pulp fiction - what I got was a fairly interesting coming of age story."
3,Historically Important--But She's Just Getting Started,"These are the first recordings of the most important woman blues vocalist of the early twentieth century. Notice that I said ""first,"" not ""best."" By the time Ma Rainey got to record, other African American women had been making blues records for three years. Even though Rainey was the mother of them all, she was following in their footsteps when it came to recording. On this disc, you hear her adjusting to a brandnew medium. This is definitely worth owning if you're a hardcore fan, but if you just want to get to know Rainey, the Fantasy/Milestone selection of her later tracks is probably your best bet."
3,The mother of the blues,"Enjoyable if you want to learn what early commerically made blues sounded like. It's importantto remember this is as primitive a recording as you will hear as recording was relativitly new. Moreover, Ma Rainey was more known for her vaudevillian showmanship than her recording. I say if you buy this then buy Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters and Billie Holiday as these were the three most importnat women of jazz/blues. And you can see just how far and fast blues eveolved in a relitively short period of time."
2,"ehh, this albums ok.","i've tried in the past to get into this band but i always come back to a few of their songs. this album, like many of the others, just gets boring real fast. the singers not the best and her monotone-like singing gets old. the beats are basic and not very imaginative. maybe it's big in canada?"
2,Couldn't hear the difference between songs,"After reading all the great reviews of the cd, I went ahead and bought it. After listening to it once, i haven't put it back in since. I think I'm going to try again, but the problem I had with the cd is that it all sounded the same. French, slow, and boring. The vocals were very pretty and relaxing though. I think it just might be that I am used to really upbeat stuff. Don't get this unless you know what to expect."
4,Excellent album for anyone who can enjoy vintage synth sounds and french lyrics,"Excellent Stereolab album, ""Metronomic Underground"" is a great opener. Stand out tracks in this one are ""Spark Plug"" and ""The Noise of Carpet"". The CD is packed with Stereolab vintage synths, interesting sounds and an intertwining of Anglo-Franco leftist songwriting and female vocals with interesting female back-ups, for those who may appreciate it. ""Refried Ectoplasm 'Switched On', Volume 2"", an album full of Stereolab odds and ends, yet good ones, is also recommended as a nice complement."
3,A bit disappointing. But still Stereolab.,"I was kind of disappointed with this album. I was under the impression that this was Stereolab's best album because of all the hype around it. I should have known better. When this album came out I heard about it a lot but never heard it. Years later I heard their track ""Lo Boob Oscillator"" in the film ""High Fidelity"" and really liked it. I knew that one had to buy and beware with Stereolab, a friend had bought ""Transient Noise..."" and it was completely different. However after hearing ""Dots and Loops"" I thought Stereolab were absolutely amazing and couldn't believe that I took so long to get into them. I consider it an absolute masterpiece.""Emperor Tomato Ketchup"" was my second purchase and I had hoped that it was similar to ""Dots and Loops"" but it really isn't. Stereolab are still an amazing band and this album is still good but if you are looking for them to keep the same sound from album to album this is not the band for you."
5,Stereolab in their prime!,"I own all of their CDs and have been to numerous shows. Believe me, this is Stereolab at their best. Aluminum Tunes is close but that is because it contains outakes from this CD. This CD has everything; hooking vocal melodies, great string arrangements, intricate guitar rhythms and different tempo signatures. You'll know after one listening that this is a CD you need to own for repeated listenings. My favorite tracks include Cybele's Reverie and Motoroller Scalatron. If you want to hear more of an electronic synthesis feel, buy their more experimental releases, Dots and Loops or Cobra and Phases Group. Both of these are good CDs but take more time to appreciate."
4,Hypnotic hypothesis,"Constantly on the cusp of brilliance, this beautifully bubbling electro-pop rests quite comfortably in an impressive discography."
2,what went worng here?,"THis could be, definitely, not a bad CD or a bad remaster. But it is bad.First, the bonus tracks:To put the worst track of the album (HEAVY DUTY) as a live bonus must only be a joke.THen, in the brief text written by the band in the booklet, they say that they did not understand why the tune TURN ON YOUR LIGHT was kept out of the original album. It was left out because it's a sugary, faceless ballad reminiscent of Poison, that's all!!As for the original album, it starts pretty well and goes all the way greatly until SOME HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL. Then everything crumbles miserably, with some of the worst Priest tracks ever: HEAVY DUTY, OUT IN THE COLD and NIGHT COMES DOWN, all unashamed pop-metal tunes with lousy drums. Anyway you look at it, you see DEFENDER is a good album, but pointed the way for terrible things to come (TURBO and RAM IT DOWN)."
4,"Rock hard,ride free.","This is the album that put Judas Priest forever on top of metal Olympus,in fact,it is quite hard to review this,since for legions of metal fans it is almost sacred.Anyway...even though many critics see 1982's 'Screaming for Vengeance'as their pinnacle,I believe that it is on this record that Judas reached their climax with heavy,powerful,authoritative songs that defined the genre and opened up paths for bands to come.In terms of metal,this is where it's at!"
4,Love it!,"Definitely the last of the classic albums. It's a solid rocker, but I still hold Stained Class as the ultimate Priest masterpiece."
5,DEVASTATING!!!!!!,"WOW..That's the only thing that comes to mind after listening to this. With the exception of Master of Puppets, I haven't heard anything as powerful as this. Whether you're a fan of Priestm or not, this cd should please you. As a matter of fact, it should blow your mind."
1,"Great Album, Horrible Remaster!","This is the worst remaster I have ever heard and it's a shame because I loved this album. There is no ther way to hear it either, unless you have the original vinyl and a good turntable. The remaster sounds like a cassette tape that was recorded to loud. It's distorted! I ripped it into my .wav editor and couldn't believe my eyes. Instead of seeing the peaks and valleys that a good .wav is supposed to have, this thing was all over-peak! I could have done a better job. Remaster does not always mean better. Metallica's first 3 cd's are lower in volume than other cd's for a reason: clarity! All you have to do is turn up your stereo. I'd say do not buy, but if you want the music I see no other choice, unless you hunt down the Japanese Digi-pack, which I have not heard but I have yet to hear a negative review on one of those. Love Bites! So does this mix!"
5,"Sworn To Avenge, Condemned To Hell","This album was the last of the great Judas Priest era of British heavy metal music, and deserves to be put into the same class as their best 70's and early 80's albums, from Rocka Rolla to Screaming For Vengeance.When you try to deny it, it throws great songs at you like ""The Sentinel, ""Love Bites,"" ""Freewheel Burning,"" ""Some Heads Are Gonna Roll,"" ""Night Comes Down,"" - every song on this album is very good. This is even an accomplishment for Priest.While I still enjoyed Halford's incredible range and their songs into the late 80's, ""Defenders"" was their last dark, genuine and complete album. That they still are releasing music and touring, is strange to me, in that I consider this album their Swan Song, in 1984.It was great to pull this vinyl record out of my old collection and find it in such good condition. There is absolutely nothing like listening to the original, master vinyl recordings on today's technology. CD's do not sound nearly this good.Rock on."
2,ANOTHER SELL OUT,"There's no shame in PRIEST releasing this album. If their only option was to sell out, use puffy hair and thing like that, they even managed to release a stisfactory pop-metal album. I must remember you that this was not a ""phenomenom"" that occured only with the mighty Priest, during the middle eighties: it also happened with SAXON, SCORPIONS, MICHAEL SCHENKER, RAVEN, ACCEPT, and other greta European bands, who tried hard to ""make America"". In Judas case, they had already ""made America"" with their previous albuns, but probably greedy executive men made up their minds about selling out and making even more money. So, in DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH we have the first clear signs of what we should have to endure with the release of the ""great"" TURBO.."
1,"Musically catchy, lyrically embarassing","One of the most consistent Judas Priest albums on a musical level. Every song is very catchy and fun. Even the slow songs are slick and well-written. Side one, in particular has a catchy nonstop momentum. A major, problem, however, are the lyrics, particularly the song Eat Me Alive. Musically, the song jams and is very rocking. The words, however, appear to be written by a very spiteful, mean-spirited 10-year old.This album made me rethink my interest in heavy metal. Sure, the music's great, but with lyrics that embarassing, is it even worth listening to?I was recently tempted to buy the remastered CD used, but at the last minute I bought Joni Mitchell's For The Roses instead. What a great decision. The songs don't rock as much, but the melodies are intriguing and beautiful, the lyrics are infinitely more interesting and the music doesn't make me feel like I drank too much coffee."
5,At the peak,"My opinion, the very best of Priest albums. Still listen to it regularly. I think it one-upped Vengeance (and Vengeance was a great album)."
5,Brilliant,"I finally have a chance to to comment on this cd. No doubt, is brilliant. I think is Priest's best. Maybe metal's best, but that's another question."
4,Correction,"For some reason, I posted in my earlier review that this album is less than phenomenal. Please forgive me. If you take this album and spin in a good stereo (which I did not have at the time) and crank the volume WAY the heck up, this album is a thundering metal masterpiece! The first 4 tracks will drive you into oblivion! Almost all the songs on this album are metal classics. I don't much care for ""Some Heads are Gonna Roll"" or ""Heavy Duty."" However, they are still good songs, just not much my cup of tea. Let me put it simply: if you don't own this album, you're NOT a heavy metal fan."
2,DEFENDERS OF THE GLAM,"This album rocks. It has Halford singing in real fine form, the songs are tight and strong. So why I rated it two stars? Simple: I just would like to know why (...) producer Tom Allom (or the band) decided to kill Dave Holland's drumming in this album????!!!! Why his precise and simple sound (which flourished in BRITISH STELL and POINT OF ENTRY) was replaced by the horrible kind of electronic / reverb sound disgracefully associated forever with hair metal???!!! IF you can sort of ""not listen"" the drums in this album, you will find DEFENDERS OF THE FATIH is very good."
4,Great no worth buying yes,"Trying to capture the magic of Screaming Priest copied the look and feel of their 1982 release with this 1984 release. Although this is a good album it almost sounds like an album of songs that just weren't good enough to make it on Screaming. Even the album cover looks like it could have been an inlay for Screaming. Stand out songs, The Sentinal & Jawbreaker followed by Freewheel Burnin'. Without those songs the album is just plain average. True priest fans get it anyone else look for those song an a compulation disc."
3,Not too great.,"This album is by no means bad, but it lacks the energy of British Steel or Screaming for Vengeance. The album sounds like ""Ok, we're famous now. Let's put out an album."" It's got some good tunes, a few headbangers, but lacks, IMHO, creativity and the freshness of their earlier work."
4,last of the good priest album`s,"priest were one of the most consistant metal bands ever.you knew that you were getting some quality music every time you got a priest disc.from rocka rolla to defenders of the faith it`s all good, after that your on your own"
2,LOST OPPORTUNITY...,"I'll stick to my old CD from this album than to the remastered version. What a dissapointment.. After so much publicity before releasing them, we've got almost the same thing, with bad extra tracks and no great insight in the booklet."
3,"When you feel safe, when you feel warm . . .","There are a lot of similarities between this c.d. and Sreamin'- poor production and lousy drumming. But forget about that for a second! Just buy this c.d. for the guitar solos, man! The solos are intense and definitely over the top! (I've always hated the term ""over the top""). K.K and Glenn do these back and forth solos, and although I'm the only one who seems to like the song ""Eat me Alive"", it sounds as if they're having a guitar solo showdown! If you don't buy this c.d., the monster on the cover will come after you!!"
2,"It has some Priest classic, but it's not their best at all!!","Fans from Judas: this record has some classic Juadas material, very, very good: ""The Sentinel"", ""Frewheel Burning"" and ""JAwbreaker"", for example. But it is definitely not their best effort!. PLease, listen to ""BRitish Steel"", ""Screaming for Vengeance"", the soft ""SIn After Sin"", and their ultimate metal masterpiece, ""Painkiller"". In none of this records are the digitalized and monotonous drums used in ""Defenders"", the band are not tranvested into glam. Listen to it and never say again that ""Defenders"" is the best Judas album, please!!!!"
5,Heavy Duty Metal!,"This album is sometimes overshadowed by the glorious 'Screaming For Vengeance'. But honestly, I like 'Defenders Of The Faith' a little bit better. In my opinion, 'Screaming' has two weak tracks (""Fever"" and ""Devil's Child""), whereas 'Defenders' doesn't have any weak tracks. Both albums represent Judas Priest at their 80's peak. As a point of reference, I have listed my top 5 Judas Priest albums in order:1. Defenders Of The Faith2. Screaming For Vengeance3. Painkiller4. Stained Class5. British Steel"
5,Defenders Of Heavy Metal,"Defenders is often said to be one of the best Priest albums, And their right. From the adrenaline rush of Freewheel Burning, To religious chanting of ""Defenders Of The Faith"" This album will not disappoint EVER.Probably the best song writing of Rob Halford's Career was put into The Sentinel, And the emotional stage favorite Night Comes Down are only a few of the Gems in this album. This album is worth buying for Rock Hard Ride Free alone! (My Favorite Judas Priest Song...)"
5,Amazing Material,"I have been a Priest fan since high school. Being a guitarist myself I listen to music more than lyrics. I prefer Priest due to their sharp, clear and melodic sound. Glenn Tipton is a phenomenal songwriter who has written most Priest material since the mid-70's. He is also the finest metal guitarist, besides Dave Murray of Iron Maiden. Every song on this album is outstanding. It is must for every metal collector!"
1,BUll.....ish,this thing sucks....it busted on me...its not a strong materialand it sis slow....better buy a speed air pump
4,GO KATELL!,I had never heard of Katell Keineg before but bought this CD because Liz Phair propped it on amazon.com. Thanks Liz and thanks Katell! This is beautiful and moving music.
5,Gently Possessed,"Katell Keineg is possessed by a gentle demon that makes her crazy. There is some of that on Jet, but more on her earlier ""O Seasons O Castle."" Jet shows much richer songwriting, fluttery voices and an aching in your throat when you listen.I've been playing this alot since 1997, it's that good. Recommended for people who like Happy Rhodes, Coctaeu Twins, Tori Amos or Throwing Muses."
4,Good Product,"I bought it to replace my older FIAMM. This model is lighter mostly because it is made of plastic, whereas the older model had metal parts, which I liked. Overall, it functions as intended."
1,very discriminatory book.,"I think this book was written by a bunch of liberals from the upper east side. It tries to be a ""good"" book for hispanics to associate with. No!! it is not good to be reminded over and over on how different you are from the rest of the white americans. I thought this book was about learning some reading skills."
1,True I'Vibes Fan Truly Disappointed,"I love Israel Vibration and I was thrilled to hear that they had released a new dub album. I already own their other dub album (Israel Dub) and was very impressed. So I popped in the cd and I felt disappointed by the first song. I ended up going through the whole c.d. to find that my disappointment never withdrew. Israel Vibration is one of reggae's most harmonic trios, but if you are looking into buying an album by Israel Vibration, don't buy this one. Their unique style that can be found on the other albums will not be found on this one. Sorry guys, maybe better luck next time. If you are looking into buying Israel Vibration for the first time, do not buy this one. The sound on this album is not their usual style."
4,solid dub,"This dub album isn't traditional rootsy dub, but it's a good album nonetheless. Isi Vibs use intersting sound effects in their dub on this album."
2,Just an extract,"Buy the book ""Harpo Speaks"". This is merely a coffee table extract from the FULL book, available..."
1,BUY HARPO SPEAKS INSTEAD!!!,"I loved the book Harpo Speaks so very much -- I've bought it for birthday presents for 2 different people so far. It's one of my top 10 favorite books. The first 80 - 100 pages are a little slow but after that? It takes off at a gallop and reads like fantastic fiction -- drama and comedy and heart -- and all of it actually happened! Well, out of love for this book, I wanted anything else by Harpo Marx and Rowland Barber and bought this book without much thought. Or research. And found, much to my chagrin, just like a previous reviewer noted, it's just THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS OF HARPO SPEAKS!!! NOTHING NEW!!! I reiterate: BUY HARPO SPEAKS INSTEAD!!!"
3,O.K.,"Sound quality is great for every song but, ""Widowmaker"" sounds like microphones and additional dubbing took the night off."
5,Easy Listening,"My hubby has been wanting this CD for a long time. Previously owned it, but wore it out. Now he has another one."
5,Where Has He Been,I have had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman in person and I can only say he is Wonderful. I must admit that I had never heard of him before but by the time I had finished litening to his album I felt like I knew him. This artist certainly deseves more exposure. He is definately a well kept secret that needs to be told.
4,"Versatile, musical - they GROOVE!","I've owned a million cymbals it seem in the past 25 years including some of the industry standard, go-to hats. 14 Regular K's, 13"" K/Z, some old 15"" Ufips, New Beats, Z Customs, Paiste Signature Dark Crisps and even a Sabian HH Fusion set. But these groove hats really have a special sound - I don't find them to be quiet at all. In fact, they're a great replacement for the K/Z's I had at one time and I've used them so far on rock and blues gigs - no problem. Mine are the natural finish - which I think brings a little more of that crunchy ""bite"" sound when playing closed. The foot splash is a little clangy and the chick is where some might think it's thin. But I haven't played too many 13""s that sound like 14's with a mid range chick sound. Overall I'm very pleased and I certainly liked these hands above the Evolutions or any of the other AAX/AA series I demoed. They are a bit pricey so stay on the lookout for a deal..."
2,Not selective enough for general use,"As the subtitle indicates, this is not a reconstruction, but materials for one. Before they can be made general use of, they have to be screened by specialists of the different subfamilies. In the present state of the work, Orel & Stolbova's comparisons are often laxist both on the phonological and the semantic sides. In addition, the tables on pages 1-5 have several printing errors. See review article (in German) by Kammerzell in Indogermanische Forschungen 101, 268-290 (1996)."
5,Cooking School In A Box,"This is a great DVD collection that teaches all the basic techniques you need to know about cooking - whether you are a novice or a fairly experienced chef. It starts with the basics that you normally don't see on the cooking shows; how to equip your kitchen, the basic pots, pans, spices, and knives you need (plus how to use the knives); the proper - and healthy - way to shop. It then expands into all the preparation basics; how to make soups, salad dressings, how to braise meats, the proper way to cook pasta. For instance, I learned that my habit of putting oil in the boiling water to cook pasta was completely wrong. It even shows you how to make the perfect omelet. I was suprised at all the things I thought I knew that I was actually doing wrong. The DVD sections are clear and easy to follow, and Kierstin the host is terrific. I'm going to make this my standard wedding gift this year."
4,Love everything about it but one thing,"This video is perfect at helping us novices in the kitchen learn the basics and more. The only problem I have with this DVD set is that the companion guide DOESN'T have all of the recipes listed. This has created a lot of extra work for me because I have to go through and watch the video and then type out the recipe as I watch, and then go get everything at the store and then go watch it again and follow along with her so that I can learn to make it. ALL recipes written would be so much easier so that I could just spend my time learning to cook rather than writing out recipes first and watching each video twice."
5,"Love it, so does my 5 yr. old granddaughter.","I purchased Cooking from A to Zest for my 20 yr. old granddaughter. I decided to review it first. My 5 yr. old granddaughter just loves it. When I attempted to give it to my older granddaughter, who was leaving to move to another state, the younger one protested. I now will have to buy another copy so that they can both have one. This would be an excellant wedding gift for a new cook. There are a lot of basics, as well as, some excellant advanced cooking techniques in these videos. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the videos. I have spent many years cooking at home and also several as a prep cook in a restaurant. Kierstin Buchner does an excellant job in her presentation and can even hold the attention of some of the youngest cooks."
3,Great for amateurs.,"Don't buy if you are an experienced cook and looking for recipes to experiment with. However, if you are now starting out or want to teach your teenage daughter how to cook, go right ahead and buy it."
3,In the absence of the full-length...,"Candy was an amazing 1980s power pop band whose one and only album ""Whatever Happened To Fun"" was a lost classic. In the absence of that being available, however, you'll have to make due with this.""Teenage Neon Jungle"" contains some great Candy songs, some demos, and some random weird stuff like audio clips from Rick Dees' radio show. While this album is worth it for those ""great Candy songs"", keep hoping for that reissue."
3,The Tense Life on a Merchant Ship during war,"Although a slow paced movie, there is an underlying tension as everyday life of merchant sailors as they labor and die to deliver crucial supplies as war rages far away or is it just over the horizon. From one scene to another, the dreams and fears of crew members are exposed. Many of the crew show their emotions as tension peaks and wanes. These are men here who would rather be somewhere else or who don't know any other life or who have hidden from the reality of their lives on a ship that is sailing in waters where U-Boats could be sighted at any moment. The Kreigsmarine is looking for you as the Nazi's have declared an open season on you and other Allied shipping. Will the next ship torpedoed and sent to the bottom be one of those others or will it be you? Enjoy the sound track as it has some wonderful music that you might otherwise miss. It is a gem of a movie you will be able to appreciate, if you just take the time."
3,Buyer beware,"This book may have lots of good information, but according to Salon.com, it is ""riddled with errors,"" including some incorrect background information, addresses, and client lists. Double-check before sending off that query letter."
3,Not exactly what I needed or expected,"This book might help some writers, but I'm not one of them. If you are writing for children, it doesn't list many potential agents for you. The most helpful hints I found were in the introduction, not really from reading what each agent had to say. Plus, the book is more outdated than I realized (1997-98 interviews). I got more info out of just googling some agents and tips. It was cheaper, too!"
4,"I prefer Blues for the Red Sun, but still a worthy effort","I like this album. With that said, I am disappointed in the quality of the recording. What happened to the vocal mix on the first few tracks? It is as if they were embarrassed of the lyrical content and chose to just mumble along with the music. The music is great but I have never been a big fan of the 10 minute silence breaks in the CD format. I am a car music listener and if I wanted extended moments of silence I would turn off the stereo altogether, not put in a CD for it. Almost all of the reviews I have read refer to Welcome to Sky Valley or this as the ""Must Own"" Kyuss albums, but for my 2 cents worth, Blues for the Red Sun is where you should start and my bet is that that is the album that will gravitate to your CD player more often than the other two mentioned."
5,Grandiose,"If you don't get it straight off, give it time.This is far better than anything by Zeppelin, Metallica, and even Tool; and those are three of the greatest bands in history; period. I've heard countless Black Sabbath covers, but Kyuss' rendition of Into the Void (on the album after ""Circus"")is the best, with the heaviest opening since Korn's ""Blind"".""Sky Valley"" is a classic, but ""Circus"" is more inventive and extremely powerful. I say buy all the Kyuss albums if you really want to hear rock perfection. Their sound is vast and purifying.I wish more people had appreciated Kyuss while they were around, but it always gives me a kick to throw in this CD for those who've never heard it."
5,"ride the high, low notes",rodeo puts me in the mood to ride the sweet rideto enjoy tunes and life as the dish is revealedout of sight
5,Immense!,"This really is one of the finest pieces of rock music you are ever likely to hear. I would put it into my top 100 records and that includes the likes of Chris Isaak, The Beatles, Led Zep, Lauren Hill etc. Just listen to El Rodeo with its understated, somewhat distant vocals and the heavy riffs.This really is warm music...heavy riffs and great melodies. Better than most rock music released in 90's. I think its a fair prediction that in 20 or 30 years time Kyuss will be rediscovered by rock music lovers and hailed as one of the all time great rock bands."
