5,Christina Amphlett and the Divinyls at their best!,"Why this album wasn't a huge success in the USA is well beyond me. Undoubtedly one of the best if not the best ablum by this band.If I had not found it on amazon I would have never known that it existed at all (thanks to the Big A for that).If you enjoy this band, you will delight in this album."
5,OMG ths was soooo good.,"im Sicilian although raised in the states, my parents werrn,t and i often saw the stubborn attitudes and fierce pride displayed in this book. This book had me crying, made me angry an curse all Sicilian men for their shortsightedness and stupid vendettas and pride. This is a must read. I will remember this story always and reread it."
3,Something was missing....,"Everyone seemed to enjoy this book but for me, it was a complete bore. It wasn't as fast paced as I expected it to be. I like the characters, but I wasn't 'feeling' the chemistry one bit, and it was such a serious read, no time for humor, and I can understand, with the kidnapp and all..... Yes, something was missing: humor and chemistry!"
1,this book brought me to tears...of bordom!,"i never write reviews, but i couldnt help it on this one. i fealt like i was drowning in fluff the whole time and i found myself screaming....""grow a friggin spine already"". Nic throws his wife out and his child cause he thinks he was betrayed, comes back in the picture 3 years later and she lets him completly railroad here right back into bed and then allows him to push her around the whole book!"
5,Great book,"My three year old daughter loves this book. She reads it along with me. She can't read yet, but she remembers and loves the fact that she knows what's coming next."
4,"Brad's reveiw that will totally help you out, i rock!","This book ""If you give a mouse a cookie"" is a great childrens book! It""s one of Laura Numeroff's great books. Its appropriate for age groups k-5 and maybe younger. Its a book that has a little boy that offers a mouse a cookie then the mouse will keep asking for more and more stuff. It's a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat to see what the mouse will ask for next."
4,Great picture book,"This is an excellent book about the different things that can happen when you give a mouse a cookie. This is a great book to read aloud to young children, as well as to use to teach organization of writing to older students."
5,We loved it,"This short book was such a favorite in our house when the kids were small, it fell apart. It was a read-aloud for the most part, but also helped the children recognize words.They memorized the wonderful story, and could then recognize the words as we read together.It's a repetitive tale, but cute in the same way as Seuss stories, and my kids loved it just as much.I'm at long last trying to trim the picture book collection down from several hundred volumes, and this one is not going anywhere, I'm afraid. The children, even in their teens, can't part with it.A real classic."
4,Cute!,Cute book for kids. Thought the pictures were fun and it has a funny story line. My 3 year old loved it.
5,if you give...,i love this series (and so does my 4yr old!) you should give all of these a shot they are cute and i think they teach kids how not to be so needy (a real plus)
5,Children's Book Purchased from Amazon:Best decision ever!,The seller was wonderful! She refunded us the money we spent on expedited shipping because she said she always sends it USPS. She sent it immediately and we got it in plenty of time to deliver as gifts. The product was in mint condition and she was wonderful to communicate with. I would order from this seller again!
2,Not really a fun book,"I have heard so many good things about these ""If you give a ..."" books. So I finally ordered two, the mouse and the dog book.And I am quite disappointed. It does not rhyme, and to me it appears the animals are bossing around their little human friend.My kids (2 and 4) did not like, and neither did we parents.Sorry."
3,Give a Mouse a Cookie,The book was too small. I wanted the regular size book which I had to go to a local retailer to get one due to its out-of-date production that Amazon does not carry. They should because this is a classic children's book.
3,mouse cookie,"I like the book, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie because it's funny. The story is about a mouse and a little boy. This book reminds me of the time I wanted cookies so bad. People who want to laugh will love this deliciously funny book!"
3,If I Give a Mouse a Cookie,I really like the older children's books but several friends were raving about these types of books. There are several in the series. Maybe I;m not the best one to rate since I am from an older generation.
5,"It's a really cute book, but it gets my toddler very upset!",There is a page where the mouse wants to draw. The picture shows a blank piece of paper and half a dozen crayons. My toddler can't understand why he can't pick up the crayons and he gets REALLY UPSET! I think I'll put this book away until he's older.
5,Great for preschoolers,"My 3 year old LOVES LOVES LOVES this book. She can almost read it to herself now. The illustrations are great and the mouse is an endearing character that kids will love. There is minimal text on each page, so it keeps even busy spirited kids interested with so many cute pictures. Also, the mouse is a ""he"" in this book as well as the boy who gives him the cookie, whereas,""If you give a Pig a Pancake"" is the ""she"" version with both female characters. They make great companion books."
2,good,"This is a nice book that is simple, but interesting, and fun for kids and adults to share time with."
2,Very Disappointed,The book arrived without the doll. I returned it for a full refund. It was a Christmas gift so I had to shop elsewhere.
5,If you give a child this book...,...make sure to have cookies and milk to share right after you are done reading it! What a fun book for preschoolers and a good book for introducing sequence of events. One of my son's favorites.
5,A classic ............,As a teacher I can tell you first hand that children love this book. The children want to hear it over and over again. All of Laura Joffe Numeroff's books are great hits with the kids. I give her books away as presents because I know the children will love them as much as I do.
3,"A Weak Version of ""If You Give A Pig...""","We purchased this book because of the otherwise excellent works of the author. Unfortunately, this is a weak story with strained narration. Stick with the Pig version, the Mouse will only let you down."
2,Not what I thought,Looking for a large e the book was didn't realize the book was small since I didn't choose any mini books
5,"Just add a few cookies, and you've got the perfect gift!","We've finally grown out of this book at our house - but it took a long time. My soon-to-be 9 year old will occasionally (in secret)read this book now, but from age 3 to 6, it was a bed time favorite!The story is funny, as are the illustrations of the little mouse, making a mess and asking for more things - and it all started by just giving the little fellow a cookie.The hardcover book alone is a great gift item, but it's better yet as a mini book with the cute little stuffed mouse. If you add a small package of chocolate chip cookies, this would make an exceptional gift. Or, if not cookies, a crayon set with some paper is ideal (you have to read the story to understand why!)For kids who want to read and listen, the audio tape will be listened to again and again. This is also one of those books that adults enjoy reading to their children!"
3,"Not Great, just ""OK""","This is an ""OK"" book. Was good enough for couple readings. Unlike some other books, this one is not so popular with my little one - he never asks to read it again."
5,the BESTEST,"This is a great children's book!!!!I loved it when I was a kid and I still do. I have shared this book with lots of children I know also! I have 4 different copies, I highly recommend this for any child!"
5,great book!!!,"This is a good choice even for children younger than four years (the recommended age). My son is 17 months old and he really likes this book. It is the only one out of all his books that he will sit still long enough to listen to. He will actually go and get it and bring it to me to read. We really like it, and I would recommend it to everyone."
4,so cute!,"this is a very cute book that my son loves!! but having it play in the car is the best, it has a song and a fill in the blank game that my 2 year old absolutely loved!"
3,"got the mini book, but no CD","got the mini book, but no CD, enjoy the book for a good price, so didn't worry about the hassle"
5,If you give a mouse a cookie,"Fantastic seller. Quick delivery, even to Hawaii. Book was in great condition. Thank you"
4,Cookie Book,"I bought this for my 2 year old as I heard so many good things about it. I think it's a really cute story, but he doesn't seem to be into it yet. Maybe he will grow into it later? I liked it. Good service and fast shipping."
3,"Nice, but small","The two books in hard cover are great if you only plan on reading it with one child. It measures 5.5x6 inches, so it is too small to use with a group of children."
4,T. Connection's mature sound.,"By mostly including tracks from the classic ""Everything is Cool"" album, this should be a very good compilation of the band's mature sound.""The Best of My Love"" , as others mentioned is a very nice track, it has a distinctive T. Connection sound. Although I think that ""Paradise"" stands out as the band's masterpiece.Another album by T. Connection that should also be rereleased is ""Totally Connected""."
5,"Dust IN THE Wind was a exceptional song, but the group was a disappointment to me. They were to loud.",I would recommend this product if you wanted to have a recording of Dust In The Wind and for that reason only.
1,Not Satified,I bought this collection becuase of carry on wayward son and dust in the wind but when i got the album in the mail it didnt have carry on wayward son but it did have dust in the wind i was dispointed because i bought it for that song an it dint have it even though they avertised it on here as it being on the album .
2,COVER IS USELESS,"The silicone skin looked great when it arrived in its packaging. I had a terrible time trying to get it to fit on my Vision:M; the M is quite thick, and the skin is just a hair too tight. This would be forgiveable if the effect was simply cosmetic, but the with it being just slightly too tight keeps the four large buttons on the front stuck in their pressed positions. Therefore, My daughter cannot use the cover at all because the Zen will not turn on while in the cover. Also, the two nodes at the top corners of the screen opening are pulled away from one another very slightly, just enough to make it impossible to attach the plastic cover. I struggled and stretched and pulled and pushed to try to get enough slack around the front of the device, I had no luck.The chargers work fine, keeps me from having to boot up computer to charget the Zen."
3,Does Not Fit the 60 Gig Zen Vision M,It's made for the 30 gig version. I however have the 60 gig which is slightly thicker. It didn't fit. also the plastic screen cover is detachable from the silicon cover which i didn't really like. It could get lost if you bump it off.
5,works perfectly!,"The chargers in this bundle are wonderful because you don't have to constantly carry around an adapter! They fit in perfectly and charge the MP3 player very quickly! I love the belt clip that comes with the skin, although it was tricky putting it on. You have to unscrew the round part and put it through the hole on the inside of the skin. This was such a great deal!!!!"
3,good bundle; bad skin,"One of the reasons we bought this kit is because of the adapter wall charger.The skin is flimsy; doesn't have a snug fit and looks cheap:( The kick stand is not very strong. My daugher will probably never use the skin. Only keeping it for the sake of having the wall charger.We also bought the leather cover, which is sturdy and attractive."
1,Do not buy,"I loved the case when I first got it. It fit well, seemed to protect it very well. Then I took my Zen out of the case, and it was scatched terribly. The case just rubs dirt that gets in there against your player and messes it up. Get a hard case instead."
5,Great bundle,"Buying these items bundled saved a good deal of money and it's nice that the adapter is built into each cord. Priced individually, it's like the skin is free ($9.99 at Fry's). The vendor shipped right away and I received the package in two days!"
3,Vision M silicone skin,"This package is definitely worth every penny. I got it because of the chargers. The silicone skin cover is great for exercising when using the provided armband, otherwise i would liked to have been able to use it 24/7 but the button symbols on the skin are not transparent at all and you can't see the buttons light up in the dark. So if you don't mind not seeing the buttons light up, then I definitely recommend this kit."
3,good product but beware!!!,This particular case for the zen vision M is excellent. I ave had my Zen vision M for well over a year and have triede many cases. Of those cases this one was deffinetly one of my top 2. There are 2 drawbacks that I can think of. Only one is a major flaw the other isn't. First due to the material it uses it attracts dust andlent like a magnet. Second the plastic cover will easily come off of the case if you bump into someone. You may notice that it fell but it is a clear screen cover goodluck in finding it. Other than those to things it is a great product.
4,Great buy,"I love it. The only thing is that the clear protective screen that came with it came off, and now I can't find it. Too bad they only send one."
5,This one grows on you,"I bought this record when it was released and thought at first that it was a bit lightweight (especially after Walk On). BUT, a few years down the road and I now rate it as one of his very best. There really isn't a bad song on here, and there are several great ones. Sure Pinnocchio is superb, and, well, so are the rest. Buy it."
3,Not Hiatt's Best Work,"The best song on this album is Pirate Radio, other than than, most of the songs seem a bit uninspired. Not my favorite Hiatt album by long shot. Still, long time fans will be pleased, but be advised, he has better stuff out there."
3,Not his best but still some fun,"This is a fun, highly listenable CD. It may not be on par with my favorites 'Bring the Family', 'Slow Turning', or his more recent 'Beneath This Gruff Exterior' and 'The Tiki Bar Is Open', but it has its moments. More production in this one than typical for a John Hiatt record, particularly with the Tower of Power horns on a couple of tracks. But that's good, adding to some weaker lyrics than usual. Highlights include Pirate Radio, Graduated, and Sure Pinocchio."
2,Not one of Hiatt's best efforts,"After the brilliant Walk On, this record was a letdown. The songs are just weak. Not up to John's usual standards. The lyrics are rather generic and musically, it's kind of dull. Does not leave the lasting impression that his best work can. Really did nothing for me and I sold it back because I never played it."
2,"OK, but I've heard much better songs from John Hiatt","This CD disappoints after years of listening to his other works. The songs are enjoyable enough (for a while) but on the whole, the CD just doesn't connect and stay with you unlike many of his other CDs. The title song is a one trick pony. I sold my copy and now I'm waiting for some new material from Mr. Hiatt (please no more ""best of"" CDs)."
2,"I'm a HUGE fan, but this album ain't no good","Walk On, Hiatt's previous album, evokes all the emotive, lyrical power of JH at his best. An absolute must have. This, its successor, is a waste. A few great hooks in some catchy songs and a lot of filler. Brainless for the most part as Hiatt trades in his characteristic raw, brilliant, knifing songwriting for dull sentimentality. Get Walk On, get Two-Bit Monsters, discover Hiatt when he was a crazed hellion, not a derrivative reminiscent."
3,"not his best, but still fun","hiatt's had some great albums (bring the family, slow turning, walk on among the best) and this one isn't too far behind, but is without the style that made his finest outings what they were. Little Head has more pop and maybe ""soft"" rock sounds than previous records, which is not hiatt's strongest suit. By far the best song is the closer, ""after all this time"" which is reminiscent of ""have a little faith"" and ""angel eyes."" ""little head,"" the first track of this disc, is particularly weak, and it's irritating to have to start the cd on track two."
1,If it is the same as the one that came with my pool then don't waste your money(I think it is),I have a cover that came with my pool and it had holes for water to drain(and all the crap on the cover went right into the pool). Needless to say this cover ripped and did not stay on the pool within months.It isn't worth covering my wood pile.
1,Pool cover worthless in windy weather,"The pool cover isn't even paid for yet and has already torn to shreds after last night's storm came through. The same thing happened with the original cover. For a month we could not get it to stay on the pool. We tried several different solutions, even clamped it on the frame. It blew off three times, then tore to shreds last night. I emailed Intex for suggestions on how to keep the cover on the frame but received no reply. Now we have two useless covers and will have to drain the pool for the winter. What a bummer."
5,Not a toy--Pool cover,"Nice pool cover for the money. I added extra tie down strings like recommended from other reviews on it. It stayed in place the 2 wks we were gone, so that's a BIG PLUS!!"
1,Doesn't last; you'll waste your $,"These covers are not cheap so you'd expect them to at least least 6 months, but it only lasted 4 month! It has air holes where the water slowly leaks through and makes it heave so it sinks it all the time. With time it just made it vulnerable to tear."
1,Pool Cover (not a toy),"The pool cover worked for a bit, but then teared when a tree branch fell on it. It also tore where the rope is to tighten it. Then it was very difficult to use."
4,Packed with good stuff,The only problem with this books is that there is so much information it's hard to keep track of what you learned. this isn't the sort of thing you should blitz through then set down. It's the kind of book you need to keep returning to over and over again to make sure you are applying the principles within.
3,Needs Freshening,"Kouzes and Posner do a good job of outlining the importance of Credility to leadership, but this book could use a post-September-11 update. Especially in light of such serious and public, ethical bumbling as Enron and Global Crossing, the authors' advice often sounds candy-coated and overly optimistic. Developing credibility as a leader is a complex process, and is even more important in today's celebrity CEO climate. The book overlooks that fact that a leader can appear credible to one group but not to another, furthering divisiveness in an organization. (See American politics for more information.) But, the book does a good service by making us think about what it means to be credible, honest and ethical in business, which is something that is often deep below the surface of everyday operations. Aspiring to what is written in this book is an admirable goal for any leader."
4,"Funny, riveting, eclectic","Funny, riveting, eclectic. This book manages to beautifully describe the small-town mentality of staff - both teaching and administrative - in a typical 'red-brick' university and its constraining effect on an English Jew of prodigious appetites.The writing is masterful, funny and entertaining. The shortcomings of its antihero, Selwyn Goldberg, explored in excruciatingly forensic detail. The book has a great atmospheric feel and Jacobson's descriptive talents are used to the full. Go buy it!"
4,Must-groove CD for Shannon Wright fans,"Crowsdell was a scary good band in the mid-'90s based out of Jacksonville; Shannon Wright played guitar and sang, and fans of hers will like the muted passion of her playing and her tawny, roaring voice. Standout tracks are ""Down"" and ""Sugar Coated."" It's a sexy record. Stephen Malkmus produced."
2,Not 'ANYone',The book should be titled 'Get the facts on anyone important' as it mostly deals with corporate big-wigs.It's also quite out of date.
3,Didn't change my pathetic little life one iota,This was originally published in Denmark in 1957 and it was either poorly written or has lost something in translation.Ostensibly an existentialist novel it does not measure up to Camus' The Outsider or Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground. The problem is not the theme of the book but the characterisation. The main character is miserable but he does not make us feel who he is. This could be a consequence of the translation because the English seems stilted. If in doubt; shoot the translator.The end of the book includes an afterward by Niels Ingwersen in which we get an idea of what this book could have been (or perhaps is in Danish). It could have been great but it fails to deliver.
3,Custom cargo net,This cargo net is made for Yakima and has double-sided hooks made to fit the bars (thick and thin) precisely. I thought it was way overpriced but figured it was made for this rack in particular so I bought it and will probably use it repeatedly.
5,Great product,Mounted on a 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe with no problems. Looks good and very little if no wind noise. Very satisfied.
5,Yakima Love,I bought this stretch net for my Yakima Loadwarrior. It fit perfect and I actually sold my Loadwarrior and still use this net on my custom made roof rack.
1,"really, really disappointed","Yeah, read great reviews and then look at wasted money. In short movie goes like this-everything bad in the wolrd is blamed on US; ok, who is talking--some chick who at tender age of 20th something knows everything and illegally in US. If the US is so bad what you doing here? ok.In addition she is regular slut claiming that is the way it should be. ok. Then she decided her lover has to be a gay too--after all she knows everything, right? Add to this wooden acting, excess of sex for unknown reason, primitive dialogs etc. OK.Suddenly Actiongirls started look really good--at least nobody talk."
5,now & later,"the deleted bite on the film was a lot better than the film is self , but the film was sill a good film , thank you."
3,Not bad,This was a lot better than I thought it would be. Could have done with out some of the dialog and bashing. But overall it was not bad.
2,Not what we were looking for,"Decent enough story for an adult movie, but we (wife and I) were a little dismayed by how little ""action"" there is in this movie. There may be 5-6 scenes that are of short duration, and they are separated by 20 minutes of political/philosophical dialogue. Not a bad film, just not what we were hoping/looking for."
2,Amazing Imagery!,"Startling images very well depicted in an unusual & surprisingly engaging format. I resisted this one, since I couldn't imagine a book-length story told in verse form. Now, I'm glad I gave in & checked it out. Excellent writing & beautiful, deeply-moving story. Topnotch work!"
1,Waste of Money,My daughter received this for her 6th birthday. It is a big piece of junk. The nail polish bottles were only half full and the polish was really thick. The glitter dome did not work at all how it was described. The compact in the middle can only open if the top is turned a certain way (it rotates on its base) otherwise it knocks over everything in the additional storage spots (For nail polish and glitter). Do not waste your money on this!
1,"If you get it for free, it might be worth it","Santa brought this for our girls. They like the idea of it but get a little frustrated. The nail polish washes off and wont' stay on at all on the plastic fake nails. Plus the fake nails wont stay on their fingers. The stickers fall off, the mirror broke off almost immediately, the glitter dome/nail dryer doesn't work at all. Overall, it is very disappointing and frustrating. Skip this one."
1,sham and spackle,"Do NOT waste your money. Instead of ""Shimmer n' Sparkle"" - it's more like ""Sham n' Spackle"". There is not enough storage space for all of the ""parts"", the sticker roll is a nightmare-it will not hold the stickers, the glitter dome does not work-the glitter just lies there, the nail polish is cheap and peals or washes right off (althought the blue polish did stain my nails after the polish pealed off)-it also does not stick well to the plastic nails, the drying station makes a lot of noise but doesn't do any drying, need I go on...? I'm looking for my receipt now to return this hunk o' junk"
1,Waste of Money,"Not worth the money - the glitter station doesn't work very well, the fake nails don't stay on, the polish is pretty bad, and the sticker roll doesn't hold the stickers right. But my 6 year old and my 3 year old really like it."
1,Don't buy!,"This so-called toy should be one of the cheap $5 toys at a dollar store. The only things that seemed to be entertaining was the nail polish and bottles of glitter. The glitter is of course everywhere since there is not a salt shakers type cap, no portion control. For $20 I expected better than this. Not only was I disappointed, but so was my 4 year old. It's super hard to disappoint a small child with a new toy but she didn't like it either."
1,STAY AWAY OR SUFFER IOMEGA'S WRATH,"Not only does Iomega ship brand new products that don't work at all. They don't want to fix or replace them either. Fortunately, I screamed loud enogh that they sent me an RMA, but I had to pay the freight on a brand new unit. The replacement they sent was bad as well. They made me jump through hoops and I still have no working unit. Terrible company!"
1,Watch out for IOmega Storage centers,I purchased the 1T version of this unit. I never got the wireless to work. I didn't try the USB ports. Installation was easy. After 1 month the drive crashed and wouldn't connect to the network. Iomega replaced it. The new drive ran for 9 months and crashed again in the same way. They claimed only a 90 day warranty on the unit they had sent. I don't scream and yell at the poor Tech. I just said I'd never buy another IOMega product again. I hope you don't either.
4,Retouching Stalin's Moustache by Thomas P. Muhl,This novel is a historical autobiographical narrative about the author's life experiences. From his childhood to his career and divorce the author flashes back sporadically from memory to other arbitrarily chosen memory and this serves to keep the reader on his toes throughout the reading. The historical detailing is detailed without being boring and the stories are told without dragging out any emotional wrenching. The tone of the narrative is very matter of fact and leaves the reader to take what he wants from it without forcing a moral.
4,Spectacular,The book Retouching Stalin's Moustache was an amazing story. The book is very well written and keeps your attention on it. I really liked the flashbacks of the book. How at one place I was reading about the tanks and Molotov cocktails and in the next I am reading about the communist manifesto in 1945. The jumping around of the flashbacks keeps the story interesting. The book is very detailed and makes you feel like you are in the same place as the characters and the fact that it is so detailed makes it more exciting. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the story of a man and his wife and their journey towards the United States to escape the Hungarian revolution.
3,Reconnecting with the past,"Retouching Stalin's Moustache was an interesting book. It took you back and forth through different time periods in Tamas life. His dream and determination to become an artist even when serving in the military. Once in the army he had the chance to paint a portrait of Stalin in which he paints it wrong and has to re do it, and that is where the title of the book comes from. His escape and moving out of Hungary, surviving the Holocaust and having to deal with his return to Hungary yet again to deal with the past all capture your heart. Retouching Stalin's Moustache I think is symbolic to his life, in that he has to go back and retouch the past."
4,Delightful novel that is historically informative,"In my opinion, the best stories come from your own personal experiences. Thomas Muhl hit the nail right on the head with his gripping novel ""Retouching Stalin's Moustache"". This root of this book is in history. The Hungarian Revolution, World War II, and the Holocaust are all things that Thomas Muhl lived through. He later documented his lifes events, and managed to give us insight into the historical background of these events, but still make it interesting enough to keep the readers attention. After reading about Muhl's experience in Hungary it is obvious to all that he is one of the few people that survived that horrific time, and managed to live to tell the tale. This book is a great read for anyone who wants to read about a real life hero. Muhl's story is brilliant on every level, and I highly praise him for being courageous enough to write about such a difficult time in his life."
4,Retouching Stalin's Moustache,"Every life has a story and this story captures the richness of Thomas P. Muhl's life. Retouching Stalin's Moustache spans sixty years of Muhl's life including the hardships, successes, and failures he had to endure. The story tells about the author's life growing up in a world of chaos. He survived the Nazis, communism, and the harsh realities of the ghetto. The book shows the triumph of his life and shows Thomas P. Muhl as a survivor and a leader of his time."
4,"Reaction to ""Retouching Stalin's Moustache""","In a time where anything about World War II and the Holocaust are over done and unoriginal, Thomas Muhl creates a spin on the terror-ridden era by writing a memoir of his experiences as a painter in Stalin's army in ""Retouching Stalin's Moustache"", a very solid debut from a promising writer. This book helps to give a greater insight about living in this time period in Europe. This is what ""The Pianist"" was hoping to be, a moving story about survival and one man's struggle to keep his life. Hopefully Mr. Muhl will continue to write more, giving us other great stories about his time in Europe. This is a man with true talent, who knows how to keep the focus of his readers, both with his gut-wrenching action and his ability to spark intellect in a person's mind."
5,Very Touching,"I truly enjoyed the novel "" Retouching Stalin's Moustache "" The book was full of excitement and very sad times. The author, Thomas P. Muhl, wrote about his night , and scary experience with Grandpa Flody. Also, the author wrote of his attempt to escape war torn Hungary. I loved the description in this novel. I actually felt like I was in the Budapest Ghetto; smelling and seeing the corpses in the street. I really liked this autobiography of Muhls life, and recommend it to everyone!"
4,An Amazing Story,"An amazing book written by somebody who has been through so much in his life. A great book that takes you into the mind of a soldier and the struggles that face him everyday as he is battling not only for his country, but also for his life. This book reminds us that we should remember and be thankful for those who are fighting for our country. We sometimes get caught up into an illusion about what war is really about and forget about the small details, but this book really gives you an understanding about how times were for the soldiers. A beautifully written book that portrays a soldiers battle not only with war, but also with himself."
4,Not Just Paint,"Don't judge a book by its cover I was once told. This is a perfect example of that saying. Expecting a book surrounding painting in its entirety, I didn't approach this book the right way. I began reading as if it were just another book. A few chapters into the book I began to realize that I had taken this book for granted. So I started over and was actually quite impressed with ""Retouching Stalin's Moustache"" by Thomas Muhl. A lifelong journey to feed his passion for painting and writing leads Thomas all over the world. Eventually ending up in Florida, the Hungarian born Muhl overcomes outside adversities such as a death of a grandfather and a divorce which leaves him almost alone on his journey. A true survivor story, ""Retouching Stalin's Moustache"" is highly recommended and is only the first book written by Thomas Muhl. A great book for inspiration."
4,Stalin's Moustache,"The author of this book describes his life as a child living through the holocaust facing hunger, trying to stay alive with his mother and father making sure not to get caught by Nazi's and being sent to the concentration camps. Then moving to America finding a new way of life receiving help from family members in order to find a job in order to keep going. The book was very in depth, the pain , and hard ache, the author faced must have been very difficult. Yet the author was able to become something great even with such a horrible childhood."
4,Inspiring story!,"Sometimes the best types of books are those written through true-life experiences. ""Retouching Stalin's Moustache"" is a story of how an artist survives through dramatic situations in his life. Just the fact that it is told from a first hand survivor of WWII makes the story a must read. The events in this story are told through flash backs and forward making the story interesting and captivating. Thomas creates a sense of trust with his readers, as he writes everything truthfully and honestly. It was interesting to hear how the Jews were mistreated and how they sometimes fooled the soldiers, especially Thomas' stories. Painful, yet the reality this book helps you understand how life truly was and how ignorant people can be. It is always good to hear how despite the many hardships Thomas succeeded in life through his advertising job and artistic gift."
3,Good story but not well written,"This was a very good story of a man comming to this country with nothing and making something out of himself with his talent. He came and found the american dream in the sense of money and success. Yet there was so much missing in his life and you can tell the the author does not even know what it is s he was writing the book. My problem with the book is the way it was writen. He is not a skilled writer by any means. He does not have a ""voice"" or personality as a writer to be able to grab the reader. He just lays the story in front of you and adds a bunch of information that is not only useless but could drift your attention from the actual story. For those thinking about reading the book, understand that it is a rich story but there will be times where you will want to just skip some pages cause they are irrelevant."
4,Worthwhile reading,"Thomas Muhl escaped from the tyrannical government of Hungary and decided to write a spectacular novel about his experiences that forever sullied his soul. It's very interesting how one event can lead to the opening of many doors to destiny. This novel tells us the story of a young man who encounters this curious turn of fate. We see the process of it all and what becomes of Muhl after this event. In turn, the novel ends up being the story about a hero in the sense that he survives many obstacles. Adjustment, suicide, a divorce, and depression are some to name. He is truly someone to look up to. His great sense of detail elevates his novel.To anyone who, like Muhl, has fled a country because of politcal problems, this book is highly great to relate to. Many people will never find peace with themselves because adjusting to a new country with completely different customs. Leaving behind your home land will never be replaced. Muhl will surely forever be ""permanently displaced."""
3,retouching stalin's moustache review,"Retouching Stalin's Moustache is a book that is reads well and is thoroughly thought out. Tom Muhl, the Author relives his childhood through this book. The reader takes a journey right beside him throughout the entire novel. Some rough memories pour out like the time when he escapes the concentration camp and lives in hiding with his father. Later his mother is freed but the struggles of living continue on. This is a good book to read and has some historical references."
4,A True Survivor,"Retouching Stalin's Moustache was a great book to read. I finished reading it in a few days because I couldn't put it down. It was very interesting to read on what a person has gone through in their life, and know that they survived it and are doing perfectly well. One thing in this book that was very important was that everything was explained in the preface. I learned more about Thomas Muhl in the beginning and it helped me understand the rest of the book. Reading this book made me realize that as long as you have something you love it is worth living for. For Mr. Muhl it was painting and it helped him survive the rough times."
1,Only the the beginner,"My co-worker bought this book and wonder how to return it to Amazon. This book is not worth the buck if you're looking for writing rather complex SQL. It only shows the VERY basic of SQL. Easy to read, but not much content. Don't waste your time here. Go find some other book!"
2,More like a pamphlet!,"Be aware that this 'book' is only 120 Pages on 8"" * 5.5"" pages.If you want more detail, don't buy this book. When it shows up in an envelope, you might be surprised."
1,Where's the index?,"This is probably the worst book I've ever bought. There is no index to help you locate procedures, commands, or concepts. Who has the time to flip through looking for something that approximates what you are trying to do? If you just want some light reading before you go to bed, by all means, buy this book. If you are trying to teach yourself SQL, run as fast as you can in the other direction. This book is useless as a teaching tool inless you are interested in learning a little terminology to impress your friends/colleagues but you aren't really going to do any real work."
3,"oh, well","Was looking for more with this CD. The tempo and rhythm did not keep me excited throughout more than 1/2 of the selections. The first 3 selections were fine, but I was then tempted to listen to other classical CD's."
2,tiny,"very small item, the price per gram is very high, I should have read the details more careful,it's my fault not the sellers."
4,A romantic classic?,His new girl friend is a crip.A very talented song writing crippled rich girl falls for a handsome lawyer.The slow romantic drama of the heart gets to you.The lawyer can't take it.She is the brave one who must go it alone.She fails.
4,Hawkwind - 'Undisclosed Files:Addendum' (Griffin),"Another decent Hawkwind compilation release from the Griffin label.Eleven tracks,total duration of nearly one hour with the tracks here,being pulled from two different concerts.The first one is probably the better of the two,having taken place in Sheffield,UK on Feb.21,1984,when Nik Turner was allowed back in the band.The tunes are great to hear,""Orgone Accumulator"",one of Turner's true pieces of performance art ""Ghost Dance"",""Sonic Attack"",""Watching The Grass Grow"",""Coded Languages"" and a Michael Moorcock recital I've never heard before ""Damned By The Curse Of Man""(deep lyrics).Personally,I'd like to hear this entire gig sometime.The next five cuts,""Ejection"",""Motorway City"" and three others are from an unidentified 1989 gig.It's good,just not as good as the first segment.Pretty much another title for all of us Hawkwind completists."
3,Hub seems OK,It runs a little hot and I did not acheive a fast net/1000 rate. The fastest my NAS drive to my Apple G5 thru the hub was 2megs per second rate at best.
3,I liked it.,"Okay, so it's not perfectly written or researched in detail, but then what porn star's life is really available to research adequately. I enjoyed reading about Al Parker and I would agree the stories about his early years and childhood tell a lot about the person he came to be and his outlook on the way he lived his life. Personally, I believe most people would admire his courage in not caring what others thought of his choices and lifestyle. I certainly do admire him regardless of whether it is a path I would choose. At least no one can say his life was uneventful."
1,Threw this in the Dumpster --,"-- immediately after our hero tells us how he found his rape at knifepoint, at the age of 15, to be exciting and stimulating. Knowing survivors of sexual violence, I found this totally unacceptable. One could almost say Okun/Parker got what he deserved. No apologies."
2,A Phlat compilation of Greatest Hits,"This Greatest Hits Album of Procol Harum has not impressed me. All the songs are there, but are really two-dimensional. Its as if they had been cut from some demo tracts and are devoid of PH's lead ins, background sounds, and depth. I got this album almost principally for their great song Conquistidor and was really dispointed with it - no big horn, no orchestra sound. It may be the band didn't leave great cuts behind after disbanding, but that's pretty hard to believe. You will certainly hear all the greatest hits, but if you are after great sounding album look somewhere else."
2,Not a good movie,"Abhishek Bachchan is one of my favorite Bollywood actors, but this was not a good movie. A song that was on youtube was cut from this movie. There's no good songs from the movie either."
2,Three days to ultimate destruction,"I had hoped that this toy might prove more durable than all of the other toys we've been buying for Ruby, our seven-month old mixed breed puppy (35 lbs), but three days after receiving this from Amazon it was completely destroyed. Oh well. Maybe this was the penultimate fish? Is there another, even more indestructible dog toy out there somewhere? She chewed the last Kong toy into pieces."
5,A Cinderella Story,"If you like the story of Cinderella you'll like this story. It's about a woman who grew up in a Christian home, however, her father was a tyrant. All of the chhildren were afraid of him. The story continues with teenage rebellion that leads to...??? The love and grace of God redeems the situation and changes her life forever."
5,Thoughtful music,"The MJQ doesn't get any better than this. Call it jazz, classical, third stream. It doesn't matter. John Lewis is a master composer and pianist. The blend of the instruments achieves a high level musicality that's almost mystical. Fontessa is a highlight, and Woody'n You swings relentlessly."
5,FINE SWINGIN LYRICAL ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There is no reason why this album by the Modern Jazz Quartet should not get five stars. This particular album swings a litte bit more agressively than some albums before it, but still has the lyrical/classical influences of their past albums. It starts off with the swingin Versailles than goes in to the slow rather boring Angel Eyes, than comes the masterpiece. A four movement composition, Fontessa. It's great. Other ground breaking songs like Bluesology, Jackson's more early popular blues piece, and Dizzy Gillespie's Woody n' You. Over all this album is bright, fresh, melodic, soul clensing, soothing, brialliant, beatiful, clean jazz records of MJQ history. And record history of all time."
3,MJQ Fontessa,I must say that Fontessa was a bit of a disappointment. It has none of the mellow sounds that Milt was famous for. Thats why I couldn't rate it better than three stars
2,N/A Unable to play,"Gave this as a give adn the CD does not play on a brand new notebook with CD/DVD player using Windows 7. Don't understand that with today's technology, this should not be an issue and is unacceptable."
3,Missing an important song,"Great compilation, but missing one critical song - ""I Want You."" Who wants to hear Marvin without that song? I would have given 5 stars otherwise."
3,The Songs,Some I know and love others I don't like so much but Marvin Gaye was a great all around singer.
5,"Great Watch, Even for Everyday Use",I bought this watch for everyday use. It really is great. I love the style and it's not too fancy to wear around campus or work. The date it easy to set and read. Not too cluttered of a face and easy to see minute/hour hands really make this watch worth the price (which was discounted HEAVILY on amazon.com). All in all the best watch I've ever owned.
3,Brush on Highlights,"I used this kit tonight. This is only the 3rd time I have used a brush on kit. I usually use a cap or have my hair foiled at the salon. I have to say this technique takes a lot of practice. About two minutes in to the application I gave up on the brush and used my fingers to select the hair pieces. I have shoulder length, very thin hair and I did not have enough product to finish the job. I will have to purchase another box tomorrow. Good thing the price is very reasonable."
1,uneven,"I am rather upset, I went to highlight my hair today, and in the box it didnt come with enough product to even cover my whole head! and i have shoulder length hair! if you have shoulder length or longer hair, find another product, this hardly comes with enough for one side of a head!"
2,Shotgun Wedding,"Problem here is that it isn't Barber's book. Creamer, about as southern as Halifax, slicks matters. Skip this. Look at Barber's work without Creamer on 1947 or actual NPR broadcast transcripts, edited, but not intruded upon by Bob Edwards."
1,Expensive harsh toilet paper.,"85% Ads, short articles, nothing really new or informative. You would be hard pressed to find more than 5 pages without at least 1 ad, most have half page ads actually. Junk, pure junk."
3,Half the issues don't arrive,"I bought this magazine subscription for a friend who also enjoys custom knives. It's a good magazine, but about half the issues never make it to his house. I'm not sure whether this is a problem with Blade, or what."
4,Blade magazine,This is a great magazing and I have been a suscriber for years. Very happy with my purchase and enjoy the articles.
4,Came along 20 years to late.,"If this cd had been released in 1964, it would have sold millions and Campbell would be a hall of famer. But, unfortunately, it was realeased in the 1990's and went totally unnoticed.Pure honky tonk, with steel guitars and telecasters. You can almost picture him standing in a honky tonk singing these songs.Campbell's career is one of the casualties of the Garth-era. A complete entertainer with 3 solid albums, whose cd's go for the minimum on music sites.Spend a few cents and get this cd. It will blow you away."
2,The song HURT CITY is a smash!!!,"The song HURT CITY is a smash!!! It's too bad nobody knows that!!! A great theme song for the album's laments. The song was written by hit songwriter Bill LaBounty. There are a couple of cover tunes on here that would have probably got this artist some notice if they would have been singles! Mark my words, the song HURT CITY is a smash!!!"
5,Great watch,"Works like a champ, comfortable and I have gotten many compliments on how it looks. It is good while hiking, biking and rafting. Doesn't pinch or fog up."
2,Need more than a bb gun...,"We bought this thinking our daisy and red rider BB guns would flip it but they do not. My daughter's T200 air rifle can though. Bummer, we were hoping we could get something like this resetting target that would get the boys away from the recycling ;) I have had it with shot up cans and cardboard targets. LOL"
3,Small,"Even after looking at the product size, the targets are really small. I'm assuming it's weight concern so they flip up, but as this is basically meant for kids shooting their first gun, a BB gun, it's not great for their self-esteem to miss 80% of their shots.Materials-wise, it's fine. Stuck it in the ground and it's held up for almost a year now, still outside."
2,Target for BB Guns?,"I bought this for my son to use with his new BB Gun. Unfortunately the gun isn't powerful enough to make the targets swing up. Totally uneffective. I wish that it was returnable, but after a few hits by the BB's the item looks damaged. Live and learn!"
4,Mom quilts to cope in modern suburbia,"I found this to be a fun little book in which the readers gets some painless doses of unpretentious, down-to-earth philosophy along with a picture of the pressurized life in nineties suburbia. I think quilters and soccer moms, in particular, will enjoy the commentaries. I particularly liked a story about a swim meet. It put the scene clearly in my mind's eye -- rambunctious teens and eager, anxious parents both spring to life amid the pressures of competition. A second favorite tells of the making of a community quilt. Conflict vies with cooperation (just like real life!, but when it's over accomplishment and sentiment rule the day. This book is a modest and humorous look at today's typical American families. It's like reading about yourself and your friends down the block!"
4,Fine Pavement,"I've heard this album referred to as the first one where they don't sound like they're just putting muddy demos on store shelves. In some ways, I agree. In other ways, it still has that muddy sound that many love about Pavement.It's definitely the most accessible Pavement album, possibly second to Terror Twilight, but if you're interested in them either album is a great place to start.But is it good? Yes! The riffs are catchy, the guys are adding new sounds to their style, and you just have a good time hearing the songs. Malkmus continues to belt out absurdist lyrics in his quirky yet alluring voice, and the rest of the band backs him with equally quirky charm. Give it a spin."
1,Never recieved the item,"Maybe the seller made a mistake, but I never recieved the CD. At least I didn't pay much so I am not especially upset."
1,too bad,"Pavement's genre might be described as punk or ""angry white boy"". The lyrics are rather intriguing when read but Stephen Malkmus' vocal range of two notes (both of which strain his talents) are overtaxed by the tunes. Let me soften this by adding that there are moments of transcendent guitar but, despite being recommended by The Very Short List, give it a pass. Download: Roll With the Wind (or even) Date w/ IKEA"
1,Don't believe the hype,"These guys are atrocious. If you want to listen to some real music played on something other than low-wattage amps, try Oasis' ""Be Here Now"""
5,Dans Review,"I think that this is the best punk album ever because it is so tremendous,faboulous, cool,good, neat,exellent,nice,and family like .I think that everyone should buy this Cd so they can have a nice start for the day.I would this cd every day of the weak, thank you!"
4,it's not On The Corner but it's still pretty hip,"I am awre I've reviewed BTC here before. I'm going to revise it since by having the audacity to declare it slow &/or boring I had virtual stone thrown @ me. There is some tremendous energy here, it's just only in about 3 or 4 songs, i.e. Stereo, Shady Lane, Embassy Row. The lyrics are as intelligent, not to mention catchy as any others in existence. The 2 Spiral Stairs tunes Date w/ Ikea & Passat Dream are unpopular w/ a lot of folk but the latter I'm quite fond of. The final track which is called Fin on the ceedee is called Infinite Spark on the elpee & has a great fadeout solofest which might have been interesting to hear the whole lot of. Slightly less overall brilliant than Slanted & Crooked but well worthy of a spot on yr shelf. I typed this @ a moderate speed [injoke]."
4,Give this album a chance!,"I bought this when it first came out, listened to it once or twice and then shelved it. I just couldn't get into it. I just recently picked it up and listened to it again. A much better album now that I've heard it a few more times. Moral: this album has to grow on you a little. And I'm a big Pavement fan. I saw them in concert about 5 years ago, thought they were the coolest because they came out and set up their own instruments!! All I can say is ""Embassy Row"" is one of the best songs they've done. It hit me like a 10-ton truck. It should've been a massive hit on all these indie-progressive-alterna radio stations. ""Stereo"",""Shady Lane"", ""Date w/ IKEA"", and ""Passat Dream"" are awesome as well. Can't wait to hear their new one - ""Terror Twilight""."
2,"A disappointment, though not completely lacking in merit.","If you liked Crooked Rain, stick with it. Everything you've come to expect from Pavement, and less. After the third time through, I found myself wondering, ""Why is this so boring?"""
4,"Eclectic, creative song structures from a great, great band","Brighten The Corners is typical of most Pavement releases in its sound - as with The Pixies, Yo La Tengo or Elliott Smith, the quietest, most tranquil phrases are often buttressed against an abrasive wall of guitars. Lead by Stephen Malkmus, song structures are eclectic and complex. If you find yourself tracking The Pixies' chord structures, or trying to figure out Sonic Youth's many tunings, these guys are for you. In which case, you probably already know about them, but who cares - Pavement was brilliant. Sample the song ""Stereo"" - I rest my case. Love it! GENRES: Alternative, Indie Rock.BUY IF YOU LIKE: Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Cake, The Pixies/Frank Black/Black Francis, Beck, Nirvana.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""Stereo,"" ""Shady Lane,"" ""Embassy Row."""
5,One of my all time favorites,"I still listen this cd every now and then. It's one of Pavements best. Every song is worth listening to. Plus the band seem to be becoming better muscians and Malkmus and Kannbergs lyrics are even stronger on this albulm. Still remains true to their indy rock roots. Best songs: The clever rocker Stereo, Starlings in Slipstream and the incredible ending epic Fin."
5,A mix blended to perfection,"BTC is not as thematically cohesive as Crooked Rain and not as meandering as Wowee Zowee, but the end result is the same as both those albums, the pinnacle of modern rock music. If you don't understand at first, and believe me, I didn't, just keep listening, eventually that first recognition of genius will peep into your conciousness, and then... life will unfold from the seemingly senseless lyrics of s.m. and the music will represent the structure of your mind."
3,Okay,Only get this tape if you have the patience to hear someone speak in portugese under someone translationg in english. The quality is great...........If you dont train in Capoeira I dont recommend this because you will not understand the movements and may hurt yourself! .....Also you could find better toturials on youtube honestly.........Good LuckSatisfied Customer!
1,no good as a max 8 guide,"Like a lot of publishers, this one has just repackaged an old max guide as a max 8 one. There is just nothing on the features new to max 8 -- cloth, hair and fur, mental ray, etc. At best this is just deceptive marketing.The book is still good as a general intro to 3ds max, but I have found New Riders 3ds max fundamentals better."
1,Lousy,"It's rare I give a book such low marks, but this one really shows what a lousy book is like. This simplistic text doesn't go into very much detail on any topics, leaving all but the greenest novice looking elsewhere for assistance. This book serves only to annoy me when I look for answers because it has none to give.The cover is completely deceptive; the author and illustrators have no such talent with 3dsMax. The examples inside are meaningless and tacky, showing only a cursory knowledge of the program itself. This book feels like it was written in haste.I would not purchase this again, given the chance. Not for the 50 dollars it sold for. Not for the 20 dollars it sells for now. Not for 45 cents. It's just not worth it."
1,Please save your money!,"Shame on me for not realizing this CD is a compilation of poorly covered songs...and when covered, done in a sappy style by less than stellar vocalists. (One exception - the gospel inspired ""Lean on Me"" is great.) I cancelled the Volume 3 CD, which thankfully could not be shipped immediately."
4,Excellent read,"This was the best of the trilogy. It made me want to read the rest. Scott and Susan were very likeable characters. Sawyer and Abbey's love did seem a bit too perfect. I wish more was said about Abbey's first marriage.My favorite of the trilogy was Charles and Lanni's story. It was the right amount of conflict/resolution. It shows that there are other factors to consider about being in love, such as how family can be affected. You root for them to overcome their problems."
1,"Too naive, too predictable","I had read This Matter of Marriage and loved it, that's why a bought the Midnight Sons series. Boy was I ever so disappointed! The characters are sketchy at best, everybody is just plain good, not an ounce of meanness in them. They just fall in love at first sight, I mean the ones who should, and everybody else just cheers. Nobody is heartbroken for more than a few lines, nobody is jealous, everybody is friendly, generous and understanding. Even for fiction it's too much."
4,DVD on The Wheels on the Bus,My grand daughter enjoyed this DVD and we have played it several times.Great for kids and the songs are enjoyed.
4,Metal Thrashing Mad,"Anthrax caught live in london on the among the living tour. They play everything from metal thrashing mad to madusa to among the living to i'm the man. Great song selection right there. when i first saw this video i was amazed at how heavy and tight these guys sounded. The only thing i didn't like (the only reason i didn't give this a five) is because of joey's pathetic attempt at trying to get the crowd going and some of his vocal screams get a little annoying. Otherwise if you dig metal, you will enjoy this."
5,Really good quality,"I purchase this Uruguayan flag together with the one from Austria, since I am from Uruguay and my wife is Austrian, and we wanted to personalize a little bit our car < :).The quality of the material is really really good, I think will take a few year before the sun would destroy it."
3,Only time will tell,"First off, I ordered one and recieved two, both of which I was charged for. I've decided to keep the second bottle for now until I can determine whether it's worthwhile or not. I've been using this stuff for about a month now, and honestly I haven't noticed much of a difference. But, I haven't given up on it yet. In another month I should be able to tell whether it's working. It's more reasonably priced than other products that are available, but if it doesn't work then it doesn't really matter how much it costs."
2,Not even single action...,I have couple years old stretch marks on my upper arms and other places from over flexing and I used this for couple weeks but haven't seen any significant results. I don't know if I'm not using it properly or this is more of stretch mark prevention cream. Or maybe my marks are too old... I wished it worked but anyway time to look for something new...
1,I still got stretch marks,I was using this thing religiously from my 5th month with coco butter as well. I still got stretch marks bad
4,Guessing game for COM4,The device works fine after I disabled all comports and enabled COM4. Took a while to figuere this one out since the manual and instruction is pretty bad (maybe it should have said in the phone manual). I use the bluetooth adapter with T68i and a PC.
1,poor product quality and poor support,"i have a nokia n-gage which runs on the symbian OS. upon installing this i realized that this product does not support the profiles required to run the mrouter program for the phone. so i called the company, which doesn't have a 1-800 number, to see what they could do about it. I spoke to the rudest customer support rep i've ever encounted. he barely spoke english and when i asked him what kind of profiles did this bluetooth usb adapter support and he didnt even know what i was talking about. i will never even touch another product made by hawkin ever again!"
1,Absolutely does not work with Nokia 3650,"This product just does not work with Nokia 3650. I had to return it back after two days. The customer service does not even have a toll free number, so you got to call long distance. The e-mail support I got was of no use. Looked like they did not even read the error message I was getting. This product uses 1.2.2.18, a totally outdated version of Widcomm driver. There are no new drivers available. After returning it, I bought Belkin F8T001 from amazon.com and it worked just great. I never had problem connecting Nokia 3650. I think the extra $10 or so I spent for Belkin are worth it."
1,Hawking is most definitely not for me,"I'm a very computer-savy person having assembled all my computers and wired all my own networks. Yet for some reason, I wasn't at all able to get this bluetooth module to work correctly on my computer.To make a long story short, the hardware wasn't being recognized correctly and Hawking tech support sent a generic ""reinstall driver"" email--that was in response to my email where I told them that I had already reinstalled drivers/software/etc.Hours of my time wasted. Never again. negative-5 stars if it would allow me to"
2,It works but not compatible,"I have a Nokia 3650 cell phone that this adapter is not compatible with. The adapter was able to pair with the phone, but the adapter did not support bluetooth serial port profile. It would be nice if Hawking technologies would list in the description which profiles it supported. It obviously doesn't support them all."
1,I can't get it to work with an Sony Ericsson T610,"I recently purchased a Sony Ericsson T610 which comes with Bluetooth. I purchased this adapter because it was the cheapest one which was a mistake. I have tried both the software that came with this thing as well as the updated stuff on the Hawking website. Neither one allowed me to setup a virtual serial port with my phone. I tried this on my Dell laptop (running Win2k), my work laptop (running Win2k), and my home desktop (running Win98 SE). One all 3 computers I can find the phone and pair it but the software won't discover any of the phones services. This might be a problem with the phone's firmware. However, I did try to connect to a Sony PDA of a friends at work (and 2 laptop's at work) and the software would find any of the Bluetooth services. I hope others have better luck with this product then I have."
4,Worked with Tungsten T3,"I first bought the iogear bluetooth dongle - it claims a greater range - but it didn't work. Intending to suprise me, my husband bought me this one from Hawking and it worked right away!Palm support claimed the web pro client couldn't use the bluetooth connection for websurfing (idiots) lots of folks do. Palm just doesn't make it easy and its not written up anywhere. Several different solutions are out there if you search, I tried 4 before landing on this one and it worked for me - http://www.whizoo.com/bt_setup/"
5,Using Bluetooth couldn't get any easier!!,"After extensive research I decided on purchasing the Hawking H-BT10U Bluetooth USB Adapter to use with my Sony Clie TG50. The set up was a breeze and I was already using Bluetooth hotsync in an hour. I just needed some fine tweaking on my clie however the installation of the drivers was effortless on my Windows XP pro machine. I just ignored the warnings that the drivers are not certified for use on Windows XP although it states on the box ""Works with WinXP."" I would recommend this to anyone who needs Bluetooth."
1,New driver on CD works with Nokia 3650 but will expire,"I bought the dongle to use with my nokia 3650. The supplied driver version is 1.4.2.10. The setup took minutes and it worked fine on both Windows XP professional and Win98SE desktops. However, within a few weeks, the drivers stops working, prompting ""Bluetooth license check failed."" Hawkings support has not returned my emails after two weeks."
2,Enormous,"Technically, the device seems to be working fine with Mac OS X 10.3.1 (7C107). However it's far larger than other similar adapters. Granted, it's the size of three postage stamps side by side. Not completely unwieldy, but not as compact as it should be."
4,Easy to use,"I've used this to connect a PDA to a winXP laptop, and it works great. Activesync and internet sharing over bluetooth works fine, although the set-up is a little tedious. Make sure to install the latest drivers, and to follow the steps presented by the bluetooth wizard on the PDA exactly. And remember that if you want to use this to give the PDA internet connectivity, you have to share the outgoing connection (local area connection or whatever)."
4,sophisticated maths treatment,"Active noise cancellation is one of these nifty ideas that can be quickly described and understood using high school physics. And in the last 10 years, there have been more products out on in the marketplace, that apply this idea.But if you want to delve deeper into the field, this book will give an appreciation of the complexity. Hansen takes you beyond a simple brochureware explanation. The subject combines electronics and mechanics, along with control systems. The discussion is sophisticated. Hopefully, the maths won't deter you. Though it can be formidable, even to someone with an undergraduate degree in engineering or the physical sciences.He also gives a good discussion of the various commercial usages."
4,We loved Harriet's spirit!,"This story moves quickly, a tribute to Sara Craven's style. Butit is not in my opinion her best story. Still, it is an easyread, with strong characters. My sisters and cousins agree--the lead character's moxy is terrific!from the back cover:Harriet had forgotten her dead brother in-law's words until she stood opposite the fiercest opponent of her life---the autocractic and unyielding Alex Marcos. He had no scruples about taking her orphaned nephew Nicky, away from Harriet, claiming the boy was his heir. But Harriet wouldn't let Nicky go--even if it meant abandoning herself to the savage demands of Alex's lovemaking. For if the only weapon she had to fight Alex with was the effect of her body on his, then she'd use it, no matter what the cost!"
5,Great Buy,This watch is definitely a great buy. Highly recommend it to anyone that wants a classy yet reasonable priced watch.
5,The Truth,"Probably one of the most insightful and visionary books ever written. Rand's prose, diction and imagery are flawless. She paints a clear colorful picture of her scenes that pull the reader into the setting. The philosophical underpinnings are rock solid. An incredibly awesome read and one you will always remember.My only criticism is that some characters need more development. Only a minor shortcoming given its depth."
3,Where was the editor?,"This book disappointed me because I expected to find the quality of writing in A Year in Tuscany. Instead, A Year in the World rambled along interminably. Where was the editor of this overwritten book? Too much erudite history and too many long attempts at poetic description make getting to the end a long slog. Also, I would have liked some description of husband Ed. Occasional, brief, stilted conversations between Frances and Ed revealed next to nothing about Ed's personality, background, thoughts or appearance. Finally, I can't help wondering how much Frances and Ed weigh? A great deal of the book is about food, and the many snacks and meals they enjoyed each day. A photo of the two would satisfy this reader's curiosity. I liked A Year in Tuscany, but A Year in the World is about six months too long."
2,A disappointment,"I liked Under a Tuscan Sun, loved Bella Tuscany, but A Year is one solipsism after another. Frances Mayes, you are FORBIDDEN from using the following words again: limpid, emerge, taproot. Enough! Overall, the book is little too precious. Some metaphors ring true, while others are mediocre. Mantova is built as if with a child's building blocks. Uninspired."
2,I forced myself to finish,"For some reason, this was on my library's Hot Read list. I found the beginning to be self important and annoying. It gets a little better in spots, but is disjointed. Not really `A year', but rather four, or so, quarters. I enjoyed much of the food discussion but I am easily entertained reading cookbooks."
1,A Year in the World: Jouneys of a Passionate Traveller,"I am sorry to say that I did not like this book and in fact did not read the whole thing. This was recommended to me by a friend but unfortunately I did not find it as entertaining as she did. Since I am going to Spain and Italy, I was interested in learning a bit of where to go and what to see. I lost interest in the details. I was interested in St Simons Island and Georgia but unfortunately never got that far. Maybe another time."
2,I tried but this was brutal,"The problem with this is I found her husband's comments far more interesting when she quoted him. Basically, the wrong person wrote this book. I gave up halfway through the second country (Portugal after Spain) she visited as the writing bored me beyond belief. It just seemed that she made no effort to meet interesting people. She also seemed to have swallowed a dictionary which is a killer for me as it just makes the writer sound pretentious. Shame this travel book blows as the places the writer visits are ones I'm totally interested in."
3,Not Ms. Mayes best book,"I agree with many of the other reviewers who found Ms. Mayes to be condescending now that she's clearly in the ranks of the luxury traveler. I bought the book at a Smithsonian lecture, where Ms. Mayes gave a fine lecture with beautiful photos. The book style however did not live up to the theme. I haven't read more recent books so hope she's more down-to-earth. Travel is not just about places but people. I too recall trips where I was astonished at what folks wore -- think tiny bikinis by large Brazilians in Rio (smile). But that didn't detract from my trips -- just added to my understanding of cultural diversity. I can think fondly on my travels, and know I'm lucky to have seen so much of the world."
2,The Long Yawn,"Gad! Such a looooooong book! This would better be called ""A Year (or Maybe 5) in Only Part of the World"" since most of the places visited were European. Long-winded and loopy with adjectives, Mayes writes about food, literature, food, art, food, architecture, and food. I'm surprised she and her husband don't roll around the places they visit - they must each weigh a ton or two by now. I did enjoy the descriptions of the crazy Italian traffic HOWEVER I got a wee bit tired of hearing how fantastic European cities are compared to poor little ole' San Francisco. Traffic bad in Portugal? Look at San Francisco! Beggars in Naples? Just look at San Francisco! No place is perfect, and I'd much rather read travel stuff written by someone who has a more balanced prospective."
2,Sounds Like Somebody Needs a Nap,"I couldn't help thinking, as I jumped from chapter to chapter, looking to recapture that melting-in-the-chair feeling from previous books, that Frances Mayes has turned into a cranky, jaded baby. I don't hear her fascination and delight anymore - or at least I don't hear the authenticity. I can imagine she's tired, and that a million obligations come with being so successful. So then, just...stop. Stop writing until you're ready to write and have something you really want to say. I started growing basil in my garden because of your books on Tuscany. The only thing this latest book made me want to do is stop reading."
2,Disappointing,"I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it."
2,This book was not edited!,"Frances Mayes has had so much success as a writer. No doubt she never dreamed that her adventures in Tuscany would bring her best-selling books and a film based on the first book. That must have been very exciting and gratifying--beyond words. We all can't wait to read what she has to say next. I think that's why there is so much disappointment about this book. I mean why is it that once a writer had so much success the editors no longer cut as much as they should? She is so full of herself in this book, whereas in her other books her writing was delicate and poetic.It's not to say that this book doesn't have it's moments. In fact, I am inspired by some of her perceptions of her destinations and many of them are similar to ours. But some of her perceptions are way over the top. That last chapter is some sort of fantasy that, frankly, I wish she had kept to herself! Her inflated self-image needs to calm down a bit."
2,Bored and Disappointed,"Wallowing through this book I found myself checking other readers reviews and found the same sentiments I had been having since the end of the second chapter. This book offers very little and seems to serve as a pulpit for Mayes to look down on the rest of us with scathing detail. After reading Under the Tuscan Sun and Bella Tuscany I looked forward to the genuine, gushing details that Mayes is famous for. However, this book was dry and lackluster at best. Rent it from the library if you must and put it down when you feel like taking a nap."
4,I liked it,"I really liked this book only because I just came back from a trip to Spain, Portugal and Scotland and shared many of France's opinions and observations. I can see where others would be annoyed by her flowerly language and occasional overblown descriptions. I'm buying this to keep (the copy I originally read was borrowed from the library) just to remind me of my latest vacation!"
1,AVOID the AUDIO VERSION,"I am a big fan of Frances Mayes' prose...and thoroughly enjoyed the audio version of Under the Tuscan Sun on Recorded Books so I was looking forward to listening to this new book. Unfortunately, the reader chosen for A Year in the World is unbearable...droning on in a near monotone her voice is nearly lifeless. I could not get past the first 30 minutes! It seems as though the reader was told: ""be somber, be serious...and never, NEVER let any light into your voice!"" A total antithesis to Mayes' writing."
2,Boring snob,"This book is okay - not great. I love travel books but the author's snobbish attitude got on my nerves. She deigns to go on a cruise and then cruelly mocks the tacky fat vacationers. She is constantly writing with disdain about tours and group travel and pointing out the superiority of her way of travel, renting houses. Near the end, she sees a group of tacky ppl and she and her husband run away, afraid that they will be Americans. Sounds like she went on some great trips, but I don't care to travel with such an obnoxious brat."
5,A Year in the World,"I purchased this book on CD just before leaving on a very long and boring road trip from the Midwest to the West Coast. The CD transported me from freeway flanked by vast nothingness, to the cobblestone streets and cafes of Europe. Instead of ""dining"" on Lunchables and Diet Cokes, I was enjoying fine wines and decadent meals as I drove. I thoroughly got lost in A Year in the World, and, like all of Frances' other books (which I have read at least once), I thought it was fantastic."
4,What An Album!!!!,"What A Life is, in my opinion, the best of The Divinyls releases. Much better than their breakthrough self titled 1991 effort. Christina Amphlett's angry and demonic voice blazes through this disc like a bat out of hell. From her schoolgirl confessions on ""In My Life"" to her pleadings with an abusive lover in ""Pleasure And Pain"", her vocals are downright saucy. At her best, she sounds like an angel with hell scorched wings on the haunting ""Dear Diary"". To put it plainly, there is NO voice today like Christina Amphlett's. This cd is out of print in the US, so snap it up before it becomes unavailable forever!!! A great price, too."
2,phrases are spoken too fast!,"The audio with this book has useful phrases that would be great to learn before your trip, however the phrases are spoken to quickly for a beginner to learn. Also, the format is inconsistent. In the beginning they start off first giving you the word/phrases in english followed by spanish. Then, without any warning, it changes to giving you the spanish word first and then the english. This makes learning even more difficult. This is not a good program for beginners. Maybe if you have taken spanish classes and know some basic spanish vocabulary, grammer, and phonics then this would be a helpful review. If you are a beginner like me with one semester in college completed years ago this program is not for you."
1,One of the worst movies I have even seen,"This movie is so bad. I hate it so much. I don't know why it achieved cult status, but it really is horrendous. The acting is garbage. It's a joke of a movie.I would recommend X-Men Origins Wolverine instead, that's how bad it is."
1,Terrible,"This movie is not funny.The scene when the people roll over the kid's head is not at all funny,just gross."
4,It's just excellent fun!,"I fell in love with ""Toxic Avenger"" the very first time I saw it when it first came out. Wanted the DVD version and found it here on Amazon. They say this version is digitally remastered...??? The video was somewhat dirty in parts...and the sound was not excellent. But I'll have to tell you...you'll have to pry this copy out of my cold dead hands...! Love it!!!"
2,bargin bin,Not worth paying a whole lot for... wait until you find it in a bargin bin somewhere for cheap and then get it. Amusing at times but mostly bad acting.
4,For all of you new Troma fans out there...HOLD IT !!,"If you are a new Troma fan, get this video. BUT, make damn sure that you get Toxic Avenger IV (Citizen Toxie). It is better and quite a bit funnier. Don't worry, you won't be missing anything by skipping Toxic Avenger II and III. (II and III suck anyway.) Just make sure you get Citizen Toxie. IT IS FAR AND AWAY TROMA'S BEST WORK TO DATE !!! Trust me, you won't be sorry. You'll have to pick your ass up off the ground because you will laugh your ass off after watching this flick. Don't buy TA I without getting Citizen Toxie."
1,"bad, but not even bad in the entertaining way","I'm a fan of b-movies, I can handle bad acting and whatnot, but this is just eye-rollingly stupid and boring. Everything about it tastes of lowclass amateurish ""don't know what I'm doing"" filmmaking. Bad on all counts. But the biggest sin is the bad story and bad writing. If you can get through this pile without rolling your eyes or shaking your head in shame, then you all the more power to you."
3,HULK-LIKE SUPERHERO IS A TREAT!,"I just bought this recently and I thought it was good, crowd-pleasing fare, a trashy, tongue-in-cheek superhero spoof that is best enjoyed if you don't take it seriously. The way in which the Toxic Avenger kills the baddies is often gruesome, but inventive and I particularly liked his relationship with the blind girl. One classic piece of action is when our hero teaches a hit-and-run sadist a valuable lesson, culminating in the creep's car exploding into a spectacular ball of flame! Despite a sentimental finale, this is a cult gem that pokes some fun at the '80s."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Yes this is gross, immature, tasteless, misogynist (did I miss anything?) but I couldn't stop laughing. It starts out like Revenge of the Nerds but once Melvin becomes The Toxic Avenger it plays like a H.G. Lewis film. Obviously inspired by schlock horror films, the special effects are purposely over the top. This is a manufactured cult film, unlike say anything by Ed Wood, for example, in that it was specifically designed to be a cult movie. Yes you don't eat ketchup potato chips or cheese whiz every day either but if you want a good laugh around a lot of really gross special effects and a totally unpolitically comedy, The Toxic Avenger will more than meet your expectations."
5,TOXIC AVENGER Is A Tromatic Classic!,"I'm a big fan of TROMA movies...so I guess that's why I liked THE TOXIC AVENGER! The film is about a high-school mop boy who gets chased by a gang, jumps out a window and falls into a vat of toxic waste...thus transforming into a mutant superhero. That's all I'm going to give away for now, but I'll tell you that this movie has a lot of violence, a lot of humor, a lot of nudity, and a ""head crushing"" scene that is not for those who have weak stomachs. The unrated directors cut DVD is loaded with lots of extra TROMA goodies!"
3,Really good,Just another nerdy pool attendant tossed into a tub of toxic waste becomes muntant crimefighter picture.Actually this low buget horror spoof has a number of inspired moments.If you aer looking for sick humor and creative bloodshed.Enjoy.
5,Showing Rabbish Talentedly,"Probably, mixing unstoppable murdering with sexism and good laugh is really a talent producers and performers display while satirised still existing US devotion to gyms, cars and guns in a world/the USA particularly consuming artificially created products increasingly since this work appeared decades ago.A world is still here in spite growing up of generations of pre-mature then kids watching this adult movie addictively."
3,too old,a little weird but funny. Ok for the older generation' WAY too long and old school. the price was to high also.
5,great find,I was happily amazed to find this dvd at a great price. The movie was in great condition. Thank you.
4,Against All Odds...,"Few would have bet on Pete Way's career resurrection after quitting ailing rockers UFO in 1982. But despite umpteen line-up changes and a reputation for excess that matched his old band, Way's new project put out an impressive body of work - of which this album is, arguably, the best. Splicing AC/DC-ish swagger with a fresh injection of melodic nous (courtesy of newly recruited ex-UFO guitarist, Paul ""Tonka"" Chapman), the likes of Hang 'Em High, Manuel and the distinctly UFO-ish Heaven Tonight more than cut the mustard. It was also to prove a swansong for charismatic Glaswegian frontman Fin Muir. Marvellous stuff."
5,So Sweet,I keep it around for when I need a warm fuzzy story. I bought one for my granddaughter because see has two furry friends.
5,Chicken soup for the cat lovers soul,"I dearly love this book, a great read for any cat lover or animal lover in general. This book lifts my spirts and makes me feel warm and fuzzy after reading it improves my mood for the day. Highly recommeded."
3,Medieval Noir? As if medieval wasn't noir enough.,"The book did not seem to have a ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"" or even a truly conclusive ending. Everybody had a flaw that brought each other down one way or another: the Inquisitor's self-righteousness, Gower and his family's greed and selfishness, the townspeople's ignorance and superstition, and the distrust between unlikely partners Alys and Selendrile. Most of the action took place at night and the duo conspire in seedy places: an old farmhouse, an inn (a medieval equivalent of the seedy motel), behind the bushes, etc. There is a revenge plot, but Vivian Vande Velde seems more interested in the character interaction than the revenge or its payoff (or lack of). The book , on the whole, is better than any other ""teenage romance"" novel I've read, but there could have been a clearer description of the characters. Vande Velde wrote a better description of the Inquisitor than any other character in the book and that isn't saying much."
2,Pretty bor-ing,"This book was okay near the beginning, but once you get past chapter seven it's pretty boring. I began reading this book and quit at chapter ten, then I finished it three years later. Quite a long time to read a book with less than 150 pages. It's an interesting look at witchcraft and dragons, though, so you may enjoy it. The plot itself is fascinating, if only it had been written differently."
3,A book about revenge,"I thought this book was ok. It wasn't as good as the other reviews claimed that it was. I thought the main female character was whiny and couldn't make up her mind about what she felt. Also, the theme of revenge was carried out for far too long. It glorified it for so long, I was beginning to wonder if this girl would ever come to her senses.I also thought too much modern religion, specifically Christianity, was mixed into this book. The people in this book condem this girl for being a supposed witch, yet don't think twice about the fact that dragons are flying around and such. To me, the realms of fantasy and modern religion just don't mix.I wasn't very impressed with this book at all."
2,Spolier Free Review,"I have read 2 other titles by this author, and liked them quite a but (especially ""Heir Apparent""). However, this one lacked the humor of her other works. Furthermore, it felt like it was written in one afternoon. Every possible chance to expand on the story or characters was simply avoided for no apparent reason except to get to the end as soon as possible."
3,HoHum!,"Same old stuff, and using too much from the old-timey Bram Stoker junk. Make something new about these nightpeople instead of recycling the same old same old."
5,Loved it - Too Short,"Velde did an excellent job. You get attached to the characters as if you knew them for a lifetime. It is well written and has several unexpected twits and happenings that are truly cunning and have the reader with their eyes glued to the page. It is way to short but there is room for a book two if Velde decides to do that. Amazingly, Velde can convince you in such a little amount of pages. The plot is great and entirely original i have never read anything quite like it! it is easily a rainy Saturday book I finished it in one day. It was great, not a book to pass up despite its size."
5,Definetely a favorite from Velde...,"I truly loved this book but I just wished there was more to it. Alys made a wonderful heroine: spunky, brave, and intelligent--(definetely a welcome change from the character of Lylene in ""The Conjurer Princess""), and Selendrile was truly one dragon I wouldn't have minded meeting-(even if he is a little scary in his attitude and way of thinking). The ending was nice, with them choosing to stay together, though I wish that there could be a sequel to see how a dragon and a human girl get along together and maybe see where (if at all) their relationship can go. All in all I would recommend this book to anyone, and not just to little kids either-but to teenagers and maybe even some adults who enjoy a good fantasy with a dash of romance."
5,Dragon's Bait: Serendrile and Alys capture your heart!,"Dragon's Bait was a truly terriffic book. Alys and Seredrile are some really interesting characters. I just could not put the book down. I really loved the book, and I believe that Vivian Vande-Velde had a natural gift for writing. I just started 'Compassions of the Night,' and that seems to be a very good book!"
2,Not his best!,"But okay, but many of the songs are bland and not innovative as his previous albums. It seems to be missing an ""edge"" which he always had with his albums. Prince is a follower instead a leader on this cd. Though the best is the 3rd disc, I think he wasted his time with 3 hours of music and should had only gave us about an hour. I would recommend to people who are are ""die-hard"" fans but for people just want to hear good ""Prince music"" get, ""Gold Experience"", ""Dirty Mind"", ""Rave"" and ""Sign of the Times"" is all all time classic and nothing can surpass it! His greatest hits cd is better than this one. And if you want to hear better love songs try, ""Sign of the Times""! ""Emancipation"" doesn't cut it with the love songs!"
2,Three disks of new music. One disk of good music.,"Don't expect too much out of this album. The second disk is terrific from beginning to end. The sad part is, you have to buy all three disks to get it. I like two songs on the 1st disk, ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" and ""White Mansion"". I also like two songs on the 3rd disk, ""My Computer"" and ""One of Us"". Over all, it's not worth the price of the set."
5,JOY FANTASTIC TOUR DE FORCE,EMANCIPATION IS INDEED THE ALBUM HE WAS BORN TO MAKE...THE ARTIST CREATIVITY AND MUSICAL GENIUS SHINES WELL INTO THE YEAR 1999 AND BEYOND.WHETHER PRINCE OR THE ARTIST THE MUSIC CAN NEVER BE UNDERESTIMATED OR FOR THAT MATTER DENIED! IT'S ONE HIS FINEST ALBUMS YET... SINCE PURPLERAIN.
5,A mixture of his old music with a twist of new,THE LOVE WE MAKE***** Is the highest of highlights from this CD. It has a little of that OLD FRIENDS FOR SALE feeling to it that is unique with his new sound.
4,A flawlessly performed masterpiece,"Those of you expecting the old Prince will be disappointed. While I agree this album marks the end of innovation we came to expect from him in the 80's and the beginning of a familiar mixture of funk, rock and R & B, this is nonetheless a masterpiece. Prince would not elect to put out a 3 record set unless he was dropping a bomb on us, and it is. This album is produced, performed and mixed flawlessly, a nasty stew here. The first disc consists mainly of funk and rock with a few surprises jabbed in. Disc 2 is mostly ballads and disc III is a mixture of dance, techno, rap, hip-hop and more funk! Perfection must have been on his mind when he made this. Beautiful ballads and freaky funk; the Beauty and the Beast. Best tracks are ""Jam Of The Year,"" ""White Mansion,"" ""Emale,"" ""Dreamin' About U,"" ""Style,"" and ""Sleep Around."" Get this if you like traveling in the constellations he creates...."
2,"Spotty, Expensive, and Somewhat Disappointing",Maybe I did not hear the same CDs everyone else did but these CDs have a few good songs but nothing like I would have expected from such a hyped up CD. Too many mediocre songs with no depth. Too many boring songs that obviously are only pleasing to him. Don't get me wrong there are a few songs that are good but not worth the price of the entire CD collection. Hoped it would be a lot better especially from a long time Prince fan.
4,The truth about Princes rib surgeon,"Ok, so prince supposedly had his rib surgeon flown in especially for the production of this album, I think it's pretty evident after listening to a few of the tracks. Songs like friend lover sister mother/wife and one kiss at a time can only be written when that 'special someone' dangles above you upside down from Egyptian cotton sheets while you kill it on the the piano below. The best songs are below, I know because prince told me in a dream, he whispered 'These are the best songs my little brother, I'm something otherworldly no one can imagine'.Jam Of The YearRight Back Here In My ArmsSomebody's SomebodyEmaleFriend Lover Sister Mother WifeSaviourThe Holy RiverJoint To JointOne Kiss At A TimeThe Love We Make"
4,great!,"This album is probably his peak artistically from all the albums he has done in the 90s.The first cd is fun and is extremely funky and soulful.Disk 2 is the best, with prince ranging from soft ballads like The Holy River to funky as hell songs like Joint 2 Joint.The third cd is a bit of a disappointment but it does have its moments.All in all, If your still stuck with the 80s sound,go buy something else like purple rain or sign o the times.If you like all of princes music,you'll treasure this album for years to come."
4,NOT INSANE ENOUGH FOR ME,You've got to hand it to him for releasing a three-hour triple disc set and charging you only a double disc price. But why just three discs? How about four! :)
2,12 songs was more than enough,despite this being his first independent multi-disc release it sounds very contrived and very commercial.these discs try to tackle more than they can chew.over-produced and lack of harmony.one disc would have been justice.
3,Another packed album from former Mr. 0(+>,"Emacnipation.... A great r & b soul album. There are some great tunes on this triple album. Curios Child, The Love We Make are just a sample. Many thought Prince was slacking off and not applying all of his genious talent to his albums. Emacnipation was a comback for Prince even recieving a Grammy nominee. If you can sit through listening to this album I praise you as a true Prince fan. Many people dont understand Prince's message in some of his albums, Emanicaption is pretty understandable. A great soothfull album to relax too. Great!"
3,A little word of advice Prince,"Can you do us all a favor Prince and drop Mayte as your inspiration because it's not cutting it anymore. There are great songs here like ""Soul Santuary"", ""Sleep Around"", ""Face Down"" but the rest sound he did it in a rush. I miss his originality on this one."
3,Surprisingly good,"This album isn't as bad as critics would like one to believe. I wouldn't say it's worth the purchase for someone that is a casual listener, but it has it's high points, particularly the 3rd disc."
5,Prince,"It is the best Cd what Ihave ever heard. It so pure and the feeling are so good, the words can it not say. It is really natural."
3,The beginning of the end...,"A very long and mushy affair,'Emancipation'betrays its name with its long and unjustified collection of fillers,covers and flops.This is the former Prince and the future Prince of covers!"
2,Somewhat disappointing...,"As so many people seem to have enjoyed emancipation wildly I just would like to add that I really was disappointed. I think perhaps 6-8 songs meet ""old"" prince standards, of course I should add that I loved his music till let's say 1990-92, after that I was more or less disappointed by every new album, because I neither see his old magnificent style nor any real development. I still love the whole lovesexy, sign o' the times etc. music, but his new style is just mainstream pop-soul...what a pity..."
3,"THIS MAY BE A DECADE OLD:BUT IF YOU NEVER HEARD IT ""IT'S NEW""","TO ALL THE PRINCE FAN'S OUT THERE.IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?JUST PLAIN AND SIMPLE IT IS A CD PACKAGE THAT HAS 3 CD'S OF ALL NEW MUSIC.YOU MAY NEVER HEAR IT ON THE RADIO OR TV.BUT IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN LIKE A LOT OF YOU CLAIM TO BE.WHO CARES HOW OLD IT IS!HOW MANY OTHER ARTIST COME OUT WITH A 3 CD PACKAGE.TO A FAN THAT IS A DREAM COME TRUE 3 HOURS OF MUSIC ON ONE PURCHASE.THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER PURPLE RAIN ALBUM.AND TO MANY PEOPLE COMPARE HIS MUSIC OF THE 90'S AND EVEN THE 2000'S TO HIS CLASSIC'S OF THE 80'S.THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER DECADE LIKE THE 80'S.SO JUST FOR A MOMENT PUT DOWN HIS GREATEST HIT'S CD.AND CHECK OUT WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED IN THE DECADE CALLED THE 1990'SAND THIS CD PACKAGE IS HANDS DOWN IS HIS BEST OF THE 90'SPLUS IT IS PERFECT FOR A LONG ROAD TRIP?[ROME,NEW YORK:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999]"
5,The Second Greatest Album ever released,The artist---the genius...the only person who's made an album better than this is Prince...(Sign O the Times)....Playing all instruments leading all vocals...produces all tracks...the only true musician of our time....we sadly have 2 compare him with the image conscious Madonna and Michael Jackson--only 4 star power...The Artist is the only musician...highly recommended..he has never released a bad album.
4,Emacipation is a new beginning,"The Artist's music is ever evolving. Since he decided to change his name to an unpronouncable symbol there has been a drastic change in the Artist. This album is almost a crossroads. A compilation of both the old and the new and a searching for which way to go. Through all this the music lover is rewarded with such great tunes as ""Get Your Grove On"" and ""Jam of the Year"". Every song is an experience in itself and all of Disc 2 just screams of turning the lights low and letting the music take you. This album is already a classic."
4,reviewing possibly one of the best singers in all of music,i find Emancipation one of the best albums by any singer in all music here's a guy like it's been said before boldly goes where no popster dares to go i also find betcha by golly wow one of the best if not the best song on the album it's also one of my favorite songs he is also my favorite male singer in any kind of music in my opion i'm sure he could beat Michael Jackson in a wrestler match by golly wow wouldn't that be fun if they ever did i'd be there to watch and then some also in my opion prince probably could beat all the male singers in any music awards show if he really wanted to and of course i'd try to be at every awards show that he's at.
1,Broken,I ordered this in November just received it and the case was broken and one of the CD's scrtached( so not useful) I contacted the seller did received a response that they would replace the case if possible and give me $1.55 back as a partial refund...that is why I keep saying if the seller is not Amazon I am never doing that again just does not work out. so I guess the other two disk are ok have not checked...frustrated.
1,THE ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS GOOD,"wait for it in the charity shops and the buy the mauve binchy novel next to it for a slighty less cheesy and self obsessed load of bollocks.emancipation,next to the prince of old pangs of mid-life crisis.sorry...."
5,Delightful Journey,"From the Great Wound was an exceptional adventure fantasy novel. It has everything you would expect in either genre. I was hooked from the beginning when the melder saved the wolf, and the entire book was a wonderful journey for me as I followed along with the two on their quest. This marvelous story had suspense, humor and delightful characters. I highly recommend this book."
2,A disappointment,"This 102 page book was much too short--nor was it as good as I expected. A much better book on Margot Fonteyn would be her own autobiography--which, alas, is probably out of print. I am looking forward to the book by Daneman coming out later this year."
2,Loud,"The fan works well enough but I can't get over how remarkably LOUD it is. It sounds like there's a jet engine in my computer. Needless to say, it's going back."
3,Can you copyright Brian Wilsons music?,"This CD is an absolute hoot! I expected the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds""/""Smile"" comparisons, but this is ridiculous. Okay, so the first track sounds like ""Keep An Eye on Summer""; another repeats the line ""Get a breath of that Country Air"". But then there's the complete re-making of ""Smile"" outtakes (""Airkiss"" will be recognized by anyone with the bootlegs), and even a version of ""Trombone Dixie"" with lyrics (""This Day"")! These are not songs that ""evoke"" the Beach Boys sound; these are faithful reproductions with added vocals. Its funny stuff, and any Beach Boys fan who knows their stuff will have a good laugh. Stereolab? That's even funnier. I only wish the AIS originals were as compelling as their remakes."
4,Would-Be 60s Pop Classics,"The only way I can come up with a description of this band is Shelley Fabares(Johnny Angel) backed by the Cranberries.An absolutely brilliant recording, the disk opens with a number that, if you're a guy, will have you wondering if you should call up that little honey you let slip through your fingers years ago and see if she's still available. The best cuts, in my opinion, are Dust To Ashes and Touch The Rain. Both would have been clear high chart topping classics in the days of AM radio.The band behind this angelic voice is tight, rhythmic, solid and conjures days of the British Invasion....but after some thought, the ""sound"" could very well be B-52ish or Go-Go ish. This is the kind of cd you play for your friends and say, ""Chick THIS out.""But only if you're a dyed-in-the-wool lover of classic pop music.Otherwise, you might blush!"
3,A Sunny Afternoon,"Mysteriously compared to Stereolab, Adventures in Stereo sound more like The Primitives filtered through Phil Spector. Monomania, their second full length release, is like a sunny afternoon: pleasant, achingly beautiful, easy to forget when the next one rolls around. Memorable cuts: ""Behind the Trees"", ""Airkiss""."
5,Perfect,"I love this magnet, and it definitely goes with all the other cat magnets/stickers on my ""Kitty Mobile""!!Remember to remove it before going through the car wash!"
5,Animal Ribbon Review,"Very hardy, magnetic ribbon sticks to all parts of my car. Just remove it before going through a drive through car wash!"
4,Great Reference,"As a pharmacy student, I found this to be an excellent reference - it covers an incredibly wide variety of topics in fantastic detail. However, the book is a little too wordy and detailed to get the overall grasp of a subject if you are covering it for the first time. But if you just need to look up that certain drug, side effect, condition or other similar information this is the book for you! There are great summary and comparison charts, easy to follow headings and a great index."
5,True to its name!,"Being English and living in the U.S., this takes me back to being a kid in England. My husband (also English)and I listen to this CD over and over again at xmas while putting up the tree and drinking eggnog (with Brandy of course!). Anyway, it is a must in your CD collection no matter where you come from. It has some great pop/rock tunes as well as old classics. You will not be disappointed. I don't think this is the edition that I have, but from the other reviews, it looks as good as the one I have. Enjoy!!"
5,"Again, true to title!","My husband bought this cd when he lived in England, and brought it over when he moved to the states. I immediately loved it! It has a great compilation of songs and artists, and I find myself listening to it even when he isn't home.We had an issue with the second disc (crack) so we bought the newer version, but aren't too keen on the added songs."
5,Iron Horse of Racing,"When you read this book and see how much Dr Fager accomplisheed in his career, you have to marvel at this horse.While everyone points to Secretariat as the greatest os all time, I bet Dr Fager would have give him a run for his money ESPECIALLY if they ran in a sprint race(a race uner 1 mile).The single most amazing record Dr Fager held was his 1:20, 7 Furlong time. Its not just the time, look at the weight he carried ! Most horses would have collapsed or pulled up in distress, but the Dr kept on rolling strong.Steve Haskin did another noteworthy job on this one and it deserves to be in your Library.Best Regards to all, MC - TheStickRules.Com"
4,Disappointed,"I wanted interiors, not courtyards. Based on what little info Amazon has provided I expected interiors to be ""behind the doors"". As for courtyard ideas it is good but not great. Most are a little better than average. I didn't want to rate the book lower just because it isn't what I wanted and the title is a little misleading. The author's book ""The Doors of SMA"" is very good. It shows doors. - jim"
1,IF YOU LIKE PHOTOS...THIS IS YOUR BOOK,"However, If you would like to read about San Miguel, then this is not the book for you. There are about 8-9 pages of reading, then 80 pages of photos. Not very much info on San Miguel.Not what I was looking for."
4,I stayed up all night with this one!,"This book is a definate read. Daniel has always been one of my favorite brother's, and this book allows you to get a better feel for him as a character. Karlee is so dynamic and brave, yet she's always filled with self-doubt. Watching these two fall in love was such an enjoyable experience. But to avoid confusion, be sure to read, ""The Texan's Touch"" and ""To Kiss a Texan"""
4,Glad I Took a Chance,"When I had heard that the guy who does the ""Hi, I'm a Mac"" t.v. commercial was in this film, my interest was piqued. Didn't know who the other actors were.... didn't matter: the story, a variation on the David vs Goliath theme, was compelling. It is unfortunate that the cover art of the DVD gives the impression of this being a teenage romantic comedy. The movie itself belies that image - it's a complex, textured story about good and evil, innocence and knowing, honesty and deceit. My only criticism: perhaps the movie tries to take on too many deep contradictions. Even so, ""Taking Chances"" is worth watching."
2,Taking Chances Is A Disappointment,"Justin Long plus an indie film should equal a great movie but Taking Chances falls flat. The majority of the movie is predictable. The story line is under developed. The suspense was nonexistent. The ending is unsatisfying. It did have some laughable moments so it wasn't all a waste.Chase Revere (Justin Long) loves the history of the little town he where he resides. The residents of the town are at their wits end trying to keep the town afloat. When the town gets the answer to their prayers in the form of an Indian casino, Chase desperately seeks to stop the destruction of the towns historic battle site. Chase turns to his best friend and the new girl (cue romance music) in town to aide Chase in his quest to save the town."
5,Janis Ian at her Best,"I have treasured this album since it was released in 1978. This eponymous set features Janis Ian's best piano playing and some of her most heart wrenching lyrics. The singing and harmonies are outstanding as well.The achingly beautiful Hopper Painting and Do You Wanna Dance stand out as slow, moving pieces that show the writer poignantly reaching out but perhaps not expecting to find her love match. Silly Habits is perhaps her best jazz song and That Grand Illusion should have been an Adult Contemporary hit. I Need To Live Alone Again may be the saddest song in her repertoire, but coming from Janis, the pain seems so real, yet we can believe in her strength to overcome heartache and continue delivering powerful, gorgeous music.I'm so glad to find that this is finally on CD at a reasonable price (though I paid a fair share more for the handwritten lyrics to a couple of these songs when she held a charity auction in tribute to her mother in 1998)."
4,Phantom Stallion # 13: Heartbreak Bronco,"This book is good. Jinx is cute, and HARP is a neat idea, but this Phantom Stallion book lacks some of the luster that the others in the series have. Same case with Moonrise. It a good read though, something to pass the time. Have fun with it! I would recommend getting Red Feather Filly or Free Again, though."
5,Phantom Stallion,My granddaughter is 11 and currently loves this series of books. This was a Christmas gift and I don't think she has read it yet.
4,Very nice book,"This book is a little ""fast-paced"" I think: they solve everything so quickly and easily that is a bit silly. I don't think some of the problems could have been fixed in just a few days like it was in the book. Also, Slocum's behavior is getting a little extreme and unrealistic to me though. I mean, yes he is a rich, spoiled jerk but he is starting to act like some silly character from a morning cartoon, always cursing Samantha and blaming her for everything. It seems a bit extreme to me.However, I do like Jinx a lot and the story itself was a lot of fun to read and very enjoyable."
2,invisibly heavy,"In the dark, the second is visible but the minute and the hour are almost invisible; though I don't live by the second. It's heavy too. But it is reliable so far."
1,Bad item; Good service,The book came in very bad condition. Literally fell apart in my hands. Seller was most concerned and offered full credit.
1,Quack,"Stephen Barrett, M.D.On Nov. 24, 1997, Kurt W. Donsbach, D.C., was sentenced to a year in federal prison by a federal judge in San Diego. In 1996, Donsbach pled guilty to smuggling unapproved drugs into the U.S. and not paying income tax on the money he made for selling them. In a plea bargain with the U.S. Attorney's office he forfeited about $165,000 and paid an additional $150,000 in back taxes. Donsbach was scheduled to report to prison on April 27, 1998, but his attorney said that sentence might be modified after Donsbach testified in a trial scheduled for next year in Texas. However, the trial was not held and Donsbach has yet to be imprisoned."
3,Real or not real? That is the question,"Who knows if this bag is truly authentic, but I purchased it without really knowing or edcuating myself about ""knock-off"" replicas. I trust Amazon.com wouldn't sell such ""knock-off's,"" but sometimes you never know when purchasing items over the internet. The authenticity of this product still remains in question.The purse itself is not the best. I didn't return it because I love the color of the bag, it's mauve and I have plenty of outfits that will go with it perfectly. I also never received a dust cover or sleeper (which I thought it should have came with). I despise the fact that this handbag doesn't have a zipped pocket inside and the handle could have been made of leather rather than this canvas/cotton-like material. I would definitely expect much more from Prada (if this is the real deal), but you get what you paid for if you decide to keep it. All in all, this little handbag holds all my necessary essentials."
1,Boaring,"Somehow the story is very predictable, and none of the characters made me feel anything for them.While the girl (Ruth) is stupid enough, it does not stop everyone to like her because of her looks. I also do not see many excuses for seducing the minor (as she is in her spirits and mental development)."
4,A Great Read with a Wonderful Message,"I loved Ruth! I was completely enthralled by the characters, the message, the story, the style of writing... it was all beautifully spun together by Elizabeth Gaskell to create a masterpiece; a tale of sin and redemption, of loss and true gain."
3,New to Coin Collecting,"This magazine basically only gives current values of coins, etc. I thought it would give ideas on how to get started, where to look for information on collecting or where to order things like coin folders, etc. The prices in this magazine were very different from the the red book and blue book. Who is right?"
5,A VIDEO GAME WITH A MASTERPIECE MUSIC!,"I'm a fan of MGS series, I like this game because of its plot and action, but those aren't the only reason I like this game, its music is amazing too, thats why I bought this CD single, that contains some tracks (including the ""Snake Eater"" song by Cynthia Harrell). If you are a fan of this game this cd is absolutely a must-have (it also have some bonus if you insert it, in your playstation!)I never expected a videogame to have such music as a movie."
4,Great Mental Workout,"Brainfit is a great course of mental workouts to help you improve your skills to remember names, dates, places and many other things. The book offers a 9-week course with mental activities that focus on different themes. We all have some area we'd like to work on and this can help you do it. Another great book that comes at brain fitness from a different perspective isBrainFit For Life. This book goes beyond mental workouts to also detail brain healthy nutrition, physical exercise for the brain and how focus on optimal sleep helps improve memory and learning. Together these two books make a great pair."
2,I couldn't make it past 2 chapters.,I didn't get far in this book the suggested activites just couldn't be done in my lifestyle. No time or motivation to go this direction at this time.
2,rip-off compilation,"The majority of these tunes are from Smith's 1950s album called ""Moonlight in Vermont"" which Smith made famous. He has Stan Getz with him on this one. Of the 16 tunes on this recording,13 were on the 2 set Lp issued in the 50s. The only difference is that the sound (remastered) is better. Had I known this when I ordered it from Amazon I wouldn't have bothered. These compilations are a waste of time & money. If you have never heard Johnny Smith play jazz guitar before, buy it. I am giving it only 2 stars, but not because of Johnny Smith, but because I have heard them all before. Smith has amazing technique, although his sound is too ""arranged"" (which he has admitted), but I love him anyway."
2,modernization ruined the rhyme and meter,"Unfortunately, the subtitle of the book, ""edited and mildly modernized"" is too mildly stated! It is heavily modernized. It's one thing to remove some of the thees and thous, especially from the prose sections, but it goes much further than that. In the poetry section, it restructures sentences and changes words so that poems that ought to rhyme, no longer do. For sonnets, that's horrible since the rhyme structure is critical to the sonnet form of Donne.And there are editing mistakes. For example, on the very first poem, ""The Crown"", there is an entire line missing (the second to last line). And #4, ""The Temple"", has an extra line (lines 7 & 8 should be one line, but it's been butchered into two lines that throw off the sonnet).Also, Donne's poems have great emotional intensity. Somehow these modernizations manage to suppress that intensity and make them pretty mellow. That's really too bad.It's a nice attempt, but it just doesn't work."
2,Teach Your Child the Multiplication Tables,I give this book 2 stars because it contains no answer sheets. If you need answers you must spend another $18 to purchase the teacher's book. That may be fine if you are teaching 30 children but for us who home school it is an unnessary expence.
4,Good deal,"I ordered the watch on a Tuesday evening from the UK and received it on Friday morning. Free UK Delivery was bonus, however be warned you will receive a separate Duty tax charge once the goods have been delivered for 15. Despite the great exchange rate, you will have to fork out a little extra. In total the watch still worked out half of most UK retailers cost."
1,Absolute junk! Buy 4-5 if you want 1 to work.,"Beware any HoMedics fountain products. On the average, if they even work to begin with, expect the fountain to leak or fail in a few days or weeks. DO NOT put these things on or near anything that may be damaged by water. I have returned 11 various models of HoMedics fountains in the past 8 months including no less than 4 of the ""Shimmering Tower"". At this point you would be correct in assuming I am an idiot for continuing to buy this JUNK.Were it not for our pets, who will only drink from a source of running water,we would have given up long ago. Quality is non-existant."
5,cool board for pastels,"Ampersand's art supplies are all great. Their Pastelbord is designed to have a unique sandy clay coating over a strong wooden board. Its unique, fine grain tooth holds pastels and other dry media like no other pastel surface. I really preferred this to the pastel papers I've tried.The fine ""tooth"" of the surface makes it easy to blend colors, layer, and experiment with pastel techniques.Some people also use Pastelbords for water media, since they are so extremely absorbent. I haven't tried that, but I have used the ""untoothed"" Claybord 11""x14"" Smooth and Claybord 11""x14"" Textured for water media, with good results.These are available in lots of sizes and colors, so be careful to pick the right boards before you check out!"
5,just what he needed,The cloths are wonderful. He had used them in the hospital and I am so glad I can order them .
5,Gentle on skin,Wipes are gentle on sensitive skin and preferable to cloth washcloths for perineal care as they are so soft and include barrier cream. They are larger than baby wipes so you use fewer.
5,These are the BEST,"These cloths are the best we've used and cut down extensively on the need for creams and ointments for my wheelchair bound husband. We've tried everything and I will use only these now. They are soft and leave a clean, clear barrier to wetness. A great product."
2,Real slow,This calculator would be good for a user who only occasionally uses it. For a heavy user this unit is extremely slow.
4,decent calculator,"Decent calculator for the price, does the basic very well. The fact that it feeds through the back for the tape is really convenient and helps keep the tape from coming unrolled. Recommend it for balancing your checkbook."
2,Poor compared to other Sharps,"We have a variety of Sharp calculators in our office. This model was by far the slowest and loudest, and despite being the most recently purchased unit, it was the first to break. The description on this page calls it ""high speed"", but at only 2.0 lines per second, it pales in comparison to the 3.5 lines per second of Sharp's EL-2196BL. On top of that, I think the lps rating is done with simple keystrokes. This unit was very slow to print special lines (memory functions, # key entries, etc.) compared to our other models."
2,Constantly replacing adding machine,"In the 15 years I have been working at my office, I have had to replace this machine 3 times. The ink rollers constantly deteriorate and leave residue on the number keys and the printing becomes blurry and unclear. I think it is time to change brands."
1,Not a good item,I have used calculators my entire business and retired life. This is one of the worst ones I ever purchased. It is noisy and slow. The directions are written so small you need a magnifier to read them. It's not an easy unit to use and there are much better ones available than this one. I was so disgusted with this item I threw it out.
5,Great Watch,"This is the first time I made a purchase through Amazon.com. I must say, the delivery was as expected, no delays. The watch was a gift for my wife on Christmas. She was thrilled and the watch is very classy and well made. I would recommend this purchase to everyone. Highly satisfied!"
5,Easy to use,"I could have probably used pliers and drill bits to do this job, but it was nice have tools especially for it. Besides, it would suck to break off a small drill bit or score the engine internals with pliers."
4,car charger,"Works well, made of thin plastic (afraid it might break if I press too hard), but great price!"
2,A classic pretender.,"Sorry, I just dont get it. This cd is just not that good, there are no compelling reasons to grant it the must have status. Before all you Radiohead fans lynch me, let me point out I liked"" Pablo Honey"", and loved ""The Bends"". I guess I just prefer song structure, melody, hooks, etc."
5,AWESOME !,"First ever Live concert. The last song ""El Rey del Glam"" Alaska sings along with Miranda!, la terremoto de Alcorcon and Nancy Rubias !!! This CD/DVD is AWESOME !!!! una plegaria atendida. get it while you can !"
5,Take A Picture of Your Life with Janis Ian,"It can be argued that Stars is Janis Ian's best album. With lyrics, vocals and melodys that speak to just about every emotion, this album is a true classic. It should be required listening to anyone who picks up a guitar and wants to sing and write their own songs. The title track is a simple masterpiece - just voice and acoustic guitar musing about the price of fame. Jesse is another classic. Can't listen to this one without getting a lump in my throat (even after all these years). Dance with Me is a graphic anti-war song set to the most joyous melody you could imagine. It's perfection. All the other songs are extremely well done and really show Ian's range as a singer and musician. Just buy this album and let it become part of your life. You'll be better off by having heard Stars."
5,One of Janis Ian's classics,"This CD is from her earlier years and is one of Janis Ian's best. The title track is haunting and prescient, very beautiful. In her live CD, she quiets the crowd because it's best heard without distracting noise. But the star of Stars has got to be ""Jesse"". If you listen to one song from this CD, make it ""Jesse"". The give you an acoustic bonus track of ""Jesse"" but it really doesn't matter. The song is just drop-dead gorgeous. My wife and I dance to this song whenever it comes on. ""Sweet Sympathy"", ""You've Got Me on a String"", ""Applause"" and ""Without You"" are all great and infectious tunes that will stick with you a long time. It's a very good CD to sing along with. I heartily recommend this CD to all music lovers with discriminating taste."
5,Huge !!!!!!!,As far as heaviness goes this is a 10. The song writing is way above par compared to others of the genre. If stoner was going to go bigtime this would be the album to do it. Its incredible that no one really knows about these guys outside of the hardcore stoner fans because this album is a masterpiece. These songs will blow away anything on MTV like a bowling ball knocking down bowling pins after getting shot out of a cannon.
2,Wrong band!,Unfortunately there are two artists that go by the name Solace. This is the heavy metal band not the middle-eastern guy.
1,Felt EXTREMELY Cheap,"I was highly disappointed with this item. It took forever to get here and then when it did it looked and felt so cheap. It is extremely light weight and feels like plastic. I have A LOT of sterling silver and this is not real!! If you're thinking about buying this, think again!! You'd be better off to go with a different one from a different company!!"
4,Bolero Falaz,"Es un album muy real, demuestra situaciones comunes de la vida.Tiene un lenguaje sencillo.It is a very real album, demonstrates common situations of the life. It has a simple language."
4,Secret Sense,"Mrs. Francine Craft takes you on a mission when this young lady is determine to figure out her mother's death which was let go as a cold case but when things goes wrong Detective Ritchey is like the K9 of the staff because she has her heart set on finding the truth but will that truth cost her, her love one their lives, or will it cost her a friendship?Mrs. Craft writes a interesting yet mysterious story the pieces are never there so it can't really been known as a dead giveaway for she never lets you on to the murder she just gives you a hint or two that comes up much later and then the story well lets just say the story answer its own questions."
3,One Thumb Up~One Thumb Down!,"BORN TO LOVE YOU should be catergorized as Murder mystery instead of Contemporary Romance. While this was a good story, it dwelt too much on the murder mystery and not the romance between Danielle and Whit, the two supposedly main characters. You really don't get to know Whit's character I don't feel the relationship was very well developed. They fell in love at first sight and then she went to work as a police lieutenant and he as a gospel singer. The romance was secondary to the murder in the story. If you can struggle through the unending descriptions and long gaps between the times the characters get together, it can be a good book."
3,Maybe 3.5 stars,"The production, the composition, the lyrics. Everything is better on Wings of tomorrow. I would have given even a 4 stars but Wings is so much better.A must for a fan. I like it very much in fact, but I got the feeling I will listen to Wings much mor often."
1,Book review...a lesson in futility,"The author of this book apparantly does not know the value of proof reading. So many mistakes and items that either are misdirected, or do not exist in the text altogether. Never a more frustrating experience than reading and trying to decipher this poorly written book."
1,Terrible tights,Don't waste your money on these. They are baggy! There's absolutely no elasticity to them. I also bought Capezio's Child Ultra Soft Footed Tight - 1815C and they are perfect. Worth the $2 more.
1,Old Product,These tights are OLD product.....do not buy......these have not been available from Capezio for over 5 years so if you buy them the product will have age and nylon does not age well.....beware
5,The single best thing you can add to your computer!,"I've had this product for less than a week and I don't know how I did without it. Installation was easy (15 minutes tops), and the thing works like a charm. I'm now backing up the files I always meant to copy to floppy and never did. It's wonderfully easy to use. It also works great for burning audio cd's using MusicMatch. I give this product my highest recommendation."
4,Good Products but....,"this is a great cdrw to have, the only problem with this product is that it lack a user's manual. To a experienced user it might not be a problem but to a novice it might cause some inconvenience. I consider myself a experienced user and I install cdrw and use it w/o any problem, it's just that I prefer to have a manual which can tell me that it is normal for the cdrw reading light to stay on whenever there is a disc inside the cdrw. But if you think you don't need any manual then this product is for you."
2,Useless with out directions,"It always amazes me that computer companies think it ok to sell you a product and not give decent directions on how to use it. This one tops all - directions beyond installation are, for all practical purposes, non-existant. I've had mine for a week and still can't get it to store any photos for me. The help site doesn't address photo storage. All I can figure is HP must get some sort of kick back from the phone company, because the only way you can make this work is to spend a lot on long distance phone calls to their tech support"
2,Good product if you can figure out how to use it,"I ordered 2 of the 9100i machines and installed them with relatively little problem. HOWEVER, I was distressed to discover: a) no hard copy of a manual (common these days); and b) no ""pdf"" file with a printable electronic manual! There was a supposed ""link"" to an on-line manual which did not work at all, as no file by that name existed. As there is no toll-free support number, and no easy way to email HP (that I could discover), I must say that they have really fallen down on this one. What good is a great product that an average person cannot make the best use of? I am not an electronics wizard, and can't always figure these things out on my own. I know I'm not alone! What's even more distressing is that the HP web site says that there is NO MANUAL AVAILABLE for download for this model!"
3,pretty good cd burner,"this cd burner is pretty good for its price. it burns a cd in no more then 15 mins. the quality is good on the cds, except for a certain brand of cds there was static, but i think that was the cds, not the burner. some problems with the burner is that when burning mp3 files for your computer on a cd, almost every time it troubleshoots and u have to do it again, wasting a cd. also, a few songs arent burnable which is annnoying. either way, all in all, its a good cd burner for the money and if your only using it to make music cds its good."
2,This product is kind of pricy don't you think?,"This CDRW drive is way to [pricy] for its speed. Yes, it may be a high quality product...I believe this is a good product, but it needs to be cheaper."
1,just a question..,i want to know if you can put mp3's from napster onto cd's with this system and is it easy to do? i havent actually bought it yet so ignore the star rating.
3,Plastic covers,"The light covers are just fair. They are not as rugged or as good looking as the chrome grills KC used to sell. They made a big mistake as most after market companies do. The lights themselves are all Stainless Steel, but the chrome mesh light covers were just some cheap steel that rusted in no time at all. If this company was smart, they would offer the mesh gril covers in all stainless steel.The plastic covers look as cheap as you can get."
5,Just take a listen and you will know why.,"I have listened to a lot of music over the years and every once a awhile a musician, band or just a tune really stops me from just hearing a listen to the conversation. Man The Jarrett Cherner Trio is just one of those bands, tight, smooth and horned. After replaying this CD several times, I still enjoy it each time as thru it was my first listen, each tune gives each musician a chance to voice there tune and explain to you whats on there mind and man its interesting, but just like the intro, take a listen and you will know what I mean, enjoy."
5,five stars for the download version,"The cd version of ""European Concert"" that was in my library included spoken intros by John Lewis on a number of tracks; however, after repeated listenings these intros become an annoyance, disrupting the flow of the music. I don't know whether or not the current cd(s) include the spoken intros, but the download version does not, and I was happy to spend another $10 to get this talk-free version of what is arguably one of the finest MJQ albums out there. The sound has also been fiddled with - hard to say if it's been remastered - because the vibes and piano are reversed on the channels from the original cd edition. This is not a negative, just an alteration.If you have the budget for only one MJQ recording, this one should be it. Five stars."
3,"Excellent music, flawed release","In my estimation, this music represents the MJQ at its best. I have waited years for the original to be re-released in CD format. Unfortunately, it appears that the ""master"" from which the CD is produced is flawed. I have played two copies, and the same flaw was found in both. There is a ""skip"" in the ""Pyramid"" track; in fact, it sounds as if the ""master"" was made from a vinyl recording, and that the needle jumped a groove, unbeknownst to the engineer."
4,A perfect tool for the daily genetic consult,"This is a perfect book for reference, gives you an idea about what to look for in your patient and the approach section is very useful tool in the daily consult"
4,Extensive guide to clinical geneticist,"This reference book has provided useful notes for a list of diseases and conditions one may need to look up from time to time. Geneticists would benefit the most, especially in my opinion, ones that have not specifically worked in the clinical field. As mediterrenean folks, we were surprised to find out FMF was left out. Some other common dysmorphic features were not as comprehensive as others. Nevertheless, I think this book is a must in a hospital genetician's library; hence the title ""desk reference""."

1,Size 3 ball is a joke,"I ordered the size 3 ball and paid around $7. Well, I got what I paid for. This ball is a joke. It is basically a white rubber ball with black pentagons painted on it. The larger ones may be stitched, but the size 3 is not. Some of the black patches had black marker on it, I'm assuming to cover scratches. I wasn't even looking for a top quality ball (this is for my 3 year old) but honestly I wouldn't keep it if it were free. Well, maybe as a dog toy."
1,"Wow, what a dude","Over my lifetime of playing and coaching soccer, I had some good soccer balls and some bad. This ball is in name only, a ball, but not much more beyond that.While trying to be somewhat polite about this write up, the ball is more of a plastic bubble that is extremely poor in quality, feel, texture, and even labeling. One of the best features of this ball is the continual losing of air from day one. Nothing like kicking a soft piece of rubber. I would actually speculate that MacGregor used a smaller measuring standard than the Official Size and Weight one used by other soccer brands. Compared to two other size 3 balls, this one was smaller than them, which made me investigate what the official measurements were. Needless to say, MacGregor may have made their own standards up.If you care about your child, never buy this ball."
1,Toxic Chemicals,"The Macgregor Rubber Soccer Ball, size 5, came in the mail today and along with the ball was a warning label: ""These products contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" The inclusion of this warning is part of Cali's ""proposition 65,"" and is not required by US Federal law. That may be the reason the warning is not found anywhere in the Amazon description. I got the ball for me and my 2-year-old to play around with, but I don't feel comfortable using it now. I'm going to return it. Otherwise, if the whole chemical deal doesn't bother you, the ball seems fine to play with."
2,Ok but a little suspect,"I got the blue color, and it makes it so that you can't even see your contact in there to get it out, so that sucks. And I just am not sure about the quality of these, theyre so much lighter than the ones from the store. Ehhh..."
1,i dont like it,i dont like these cases because the color of the picture are dont have anything to do with the picture an i think my have a licking problem and its really small.
4,chram,"This charm is a little small, but other than that it is nice. It will look nice on my braclet."
5,great puzzle for a preschooler,"Finding a good durable puzzle for my preschooler kid is a bit of a challenge. Kids are usually not so careful with the puzzle pieces, so I need something that will withstand a bit of abuse. Also for kids the puzzles have to have lots of colors and be relatively easy to put together so they won't get frustrated while trying to figure it out. This puzzle fits the bill perfectly, and the sea life makes a good conversation piece too - I got the kid interested in a visit to the aquarium, so that counts as a hit."
5,love Ravensburger&#8203;,She loved it and could put this together very easy she was 3 1/2 years old and did good. I taught her how to look for the outside pieces first. Then look at the box top to see how things would match up. My kids had Ravensburger when they were young 30 years ago and they still know how to put a good puzzle or game together and make it fun and challenging for the child.
5,Incredibly Encouraging Book!,"Casey Treat has an incredible gift that encourages believers to stepout and do great things that can only be done with God as our helper.This book will have you dreaming bigger dreams, and giving you the faith to see them come to pass!...."
3,One-Minute Church Leadership,"This title by Malphurs is written in the One Minute Manager parable style made popular by Ken Blanchard. Even though the book is a very easy read, the content is significant. Throughout his other works, Malphurs demonstrates that he has an excellent grasp on principles essential to Christian leadership. Here however, he attempts to cover too much ground in too simplistic of a fashion. So while this book is helpful, there are much better volumes on the market that address Christian leadership, a few of which are written by Malphurs himself.If a pastor wants a quick, easy-to-read sampling of Christian leadership principles, then this book is the one to buy."
4,Great communications book,"Used this book for my Com 102 class. Loved the book, the chapters are roughly 30 pages long and has interesting content. Uses a lot of day to day examples, good information on cultures and great chapter layout. The one detail I was uninterested in is how the chapters seem to drag along on some subjects."
2,Not worth the effort,"I am new to woodworking (and planing), and wanted to try handplaning a wooden bench surface instead of sanding. Found it for $10 at Lowes, but I found it impossible to get the blade level, causing gouges. No matter how tight the screw is, the constant pushing pressure causes te blade to slip the tiniest amount to where it is not level. I wouldn't recommend."
3,Only half as useful as it looks,This plane works only on very soft wood and usually not a level plane. It is notoriously hard to adjust and I just found it easier to disassemble items to be planed and do them with my bench plane.
1,paperweight,"An excellent paperweight. If you want to actually use a tool...get yourself a box plane. I just returned this to the store. Try harder, Stanley."
1,Stanley 12-105 RB5 Plane,"Poor finish & quality, not comfortable to use, difficult to adjust, can't sharpen the blade and very ordinary results when trying to use in both modes. DONT GO NEAR IT!!!!"
4,Who Needs Enemies?,"This book is a wonderful story about relationships that can build us up as well as tear us down. The main character, Amber Thompson, is at a difficult time in her life dealing with a wayward husband, a new love interest, family, friends, and her job situation. However, she manages to handle everything like a sophisticated lady including her three growing sons. Told with doses of humor and sarcasm, this was a truly enjoyable read that was hard to put down from a debut author.Don't be discouraged by the size of the book (over 500 pages) because it'll be worth it when you reach the surprise ending. Gigi has an amazing imagination that will capture and hold your attention to the very last word. As an avid reader, I recommend this book to those looking for mystery, romance, suspense, and everything in-between. It'll leave you asking that age old question: With friends and family like this, who needs enemies?Barbara Joe-WilliamsAuthor of ""Falling for Lies"""
3,Argent in over their heads on this one.,"Argent's schizoid tendencies really started to flare up on ""In Deep."" You've got Russ Ballard's hard-rock screamers trying to peacefully co-exist with Rod Argent's more proggier epics. The two different approaches actually work well together on the classic ""God Gave Rock n' Roll To You"" but on the rest of the tracks, you either love 'em or you hate 'em. Ballard rocks out on the overly long ""It's Only Money Pt. I & II"" while Argent does his best Keith Emmerson impersonation on ""Be Glad."" After Argent's prog-leaning follow-up, ""Nexus,"" Ballard split for a solo career. The only head-scratcher on this CD reissue is why they included ""Hold Your Head Up"" as a bonus cut. That track originally appeared on the previous ""All Together Now"" album. (Note to Collectables: Although we appreciate your reissuing the Argent catalog, why the cheesey, lame inserts? Why not include the art work and photos from the original album sleeves?)"
3,Learning punctuation can be fun.,"This is a punctuation lesson in the form a mystery book. I wish I had read it in grade school or high school. After reading it, I found remembering the proper way to punctuate much easier. It is not as well written as an Agatha Christie mystery, but I cannot think of a more entertaining way to learn."
3,should have bought new,"has a grinding sound, like it wasn't repaired right. Too hard to ship back so I guess I'm stuck with it."
1,"Poor transmission, noisy",We've had this unit for years. Transmission is noisy and has to be run several minutes prior to using to 'warm it up'. Just replaced gears in the tranny that were shelled. Kitchenaid was no help getting the unit fixed. Buy your parts on Amazon online though since the local shops like to mark them up 400-500%. This is not the mixer we expected with the HD label. I've run more bread through the older one I own with fewer busted gears. Kitchenaid has really ruined these mixers. The one my mom owned got 10x the use ours has seen and she had zero problems with it.
2,Refurbished might not be worth it!,"I received this refurbished mixer and the flat beater kept hitting the bottom of the bowl. I tried the adjustments recommended by the owner's manual, but it still did not fix it. I ended up replacing this mixer with another refurbished from Amazon, but it did the exact same thing. Please be aware of this problem. It can scratch your bowl. Amazon was great about replacement/refund, though!"
3,2nd time a charm,I recieved my mixer quite fast. Only problem was when I plug it in and started it up. It took off to full speed at first setting then ran for 10 seconds then shut off. I was disappointed. I call Kitchenaid. The Operator was extremely nice and helpfull. She sent a replacement out immediatly. Receive in 4 days and pickup old one in 5 days. The repacement work fine.
1,Engine Trouble,"My machine is not powerful. It strains to beat even the most light batters. Unfortunately, I did not use it right away so the limited warranty had expired by the time I noticed the problem."
1,DOA,This product came Dead On Arrival ( DOA ) I am in the process of returning it to Amazon. I will say UPS came quickly to pick it up but Im out my money until a refund is given and I have no mixer to show for it.
3,Ok,"These were a bit disappointing. I thought these would adhere to the skin like moleskin does, but they definitely fall off with very little rubbing. I have to put sport tape over the top of them to keep them on. Having said that, they do provide a very nice barrier, especially if a blister is already starting."
2,"Not for blisters, but...","It's hard to review this item for the intended use since I was hoping the strips would act like the hydrocolloid blister bandages sold in drug stores. These don't stick to the skin but merely act as buffering layer to reduce friction, ie in running."
4,Cool Tunes,Great cd if you like alternative versions of classic rock. 60-70's style. some are just funny. The doors versions are especially comical. Your grandparents will love them.
4,Enjoyed,"I bought this CD for only one song. ""Love Ambition"" is a really nice stepper cut. If you like that style of music you need this song in your library."
1,BAD ON WINTER,"I'm very upset, first winter and the battery is already giving me hard time.Woke up early in the morning with 18 degrees here in Jersey to go to dentist, when i attempted to turn on the car, the battery fails on me. all i here is clicks, no amps.The Battery is less than a year old and on its first winter it show its quality.I drive a base version of Nissan Sentra S 08. no alarm, nothing fancy, and the battery won't work.LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT BRAND."
2,Dying after only 2 years,"I purchased this battery for my Subaru WRX hoping to do away with having to clean acid and corrosion that inevitably occurs on traditional acid battery models. It has met that expectation, however after leaving the car parked for a month it wouldn't start. Checked for any current leaks revealed no culprit in the car's electrics. Was able to jump start the car and been using it for few more months now. But there are days when it barely cranks enough to start the engine. My mechanic load tested it and voltage drops under 8 Volts after 10 seconds, so it is on it's last breath, have to start shopping for a new one. It will definitely not be an Optima."
1,Shipping unacceptable,"I refused to accept delivery of this item. It was shipped with absolutely no protection. No padding, no box, nothing but a wrap of plastic to hold the spacer in place. The shipping labels were stuck directly to the bare battery. One entire lower corner was destroyed, broken plastic all the way into the actual cell. Since this is a gel cell type battery, no liquid leaked out, but I certainly was not going to accept a battery with a hole in the actual cell. These may be wonderful batteries, but shipping totally unprotected is idiocy."
1,this battery stinks and amazon stinks too,"I have had this battery for less than two weeks and it's failed already.Amazon won't take it back (something about it being hazardous). I contacted optima and theysaid I have to take it back to amazon. Amazon said to talk to optima. Major run around.Optima said that I should have bought it from a local dealer, blaming amazon. Amazon won't even reply to me.This is the worse experience ever. This battery is not cheap either. It claims to have a 3 year replacement warranty and I can't even get it to work for two weeks and all I get is a run-around and customer no-service.Jeers to amazon and optima.now I'm not only out $130, I have to go buy another battery so I can get to work.:( :( :("
5,"Good Battery, Bad service","This is a great battery, however the people at Amazon were giving me much trouble for something that was their own fault. Either way, the battery is with me, although it arrived in a broken box!Also, This battery DOES fit the Subaru WRX, this is the correct battery (8020-164), although all the other information on this page is incorrect (which I found out after talking with Optima themself)"
2,I'm Not Buying Optima Again,I had to get a new battery today and since this one didn't last even 3 yrs. I got one through AAA that has a 3 year free replacement warranty and prorated for 3 more years after that and it was $40 cheaper. They check the alternator and the battery and replace it for you. I was up and running in about 40 min. after I called.
4,NEVER BUY from AMAZON!!!,"Yes, yet another reviewer advising you NOT to buy this battery from here!The battery itself is great, however I have a defect where it only would crank at 170cca and still started. But, Optima states Amazon is NOT an authorized seller and Amazon will NOT return or exchange the battery.Optima was reluctant at 1st call to exchange it for me but ended up having me take it to an Interstate Battery shop for them to test and exchange it, LUCKILY.I see some other reviewers weren't so lucky and I suggest they look into contacting Optima for the Interstate Battery store route.Amazon claims it is a hazardous item but the OPTIMA battery is a sealed battery. Its the fact that Amazon is not authorized to sell them that really bothers me...Bottom line ::DO BUY AN OPTIMA BATTERY, BUT DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON!I took off 1 star for the experience, being mostly Amazon's fault. But the battery should not have failed so soon..."
1,DO NOT purchase on Amazon. Improper Packaging.,"I was really on the fence with purchasing this battery online. Batteries are heavy--the carrier (in my case, UPS), will treat this battery like they treat any other heavy package and toss it around. I read the reviews (the good and the bad) and thought that they had resolved the poor packaging issue. Sadly, they have not. My battery arrived with three of the four corners of the base snapped off, and the negative post bent.Until Amazon realizes that these batteries need to be packaged better, they should not sell them.UPDATE: I requested a return, but since this battery is considered a hazardous material, they didn't want the battery back but issued a full refund. I tried it in my car and it worked great for three months. The battery was manufactured in February 2012, but can barely hold a charge now."
4,"Great product, suspect packaging","The product itself is great. I had this particular battery recommended to me multiple times and it lives up to the hype and well worth the asking price.Amazon shipped the battery without a box. Yes, they slapped a label on the battery itself and shipped it. That's just ridiculous. I guess ""hassle-free packaging"" still applies if there's no packaging at all. Slight transit damage but did not effect functionality luckily. I would buy locally."
2,Product arrived broken,"Do not order this item as with all of the reviews the item arrived broken. The bottom corner was cracked, I would have thought more care would be taken but apparently no one looks at the reviews and changes the way things are sent out."
5,Best batteries I have ever purchased,"I use these Optima Red Top batteries in all my vehicles and they do extremely well, especially in cold weather conditions. But I have a few cars that I seldomly drive, so I do recommend that if you don't frequently drive your vehicles during the winter that you keep the batteries maintained with a smart charger or tender. I personally useNOCO Genius G3500 6V/12V 3.5A Automatic Multi-Purpose Battery Charger and Maintainer (Grey)but there are other less expensive chargers on the market too, I just know that this charger is top notch and has kept all my Optima Rep Tops successfully charged."
1,WARNING: NO Warranty if purchased from Amazon,"Optima red top batteries normally come with a full 3 year replacement warranty, but not if you purchase it from Amazon. My 16 month old Optima failed and Optima customer service said Amazon is responsible for warranty claims. The Amazon CSR stated there is only the normal 30 day warranty on these items, they do not honor or assist you in getting regular warranty service. I would NEVER consider making a similar purchase from Amazon again."
1,Not what they used to be,"Have a friend who has had one for almost ten years and still going strong. That was enough to convince me to get one for my car, but after 15 months, it is now dead. Purchased from Interstate, and they or Optima will not honor warranty. Ended up putting the OEM battery back in, and at 300 less CCA's, my car turns over much faster than it ever did with the Optima.I wish I would have listened to others, and went with a high quality sealed lead acid battery. Never again!"
5,Best battery available!,"Best battery I have bought ever. I don't take the car out of the garage too often, just on some weekends and nicer days, so the car `sits' there a lot. Past batteries would lose charge, and would require a jump start almost every time. Now that I have the Optima Battery in there, the car starts up ever time without jumping it. And if you notice the cold cranking amps (CCA) is about double the average battery, which is good in the winter if you live in the colder areas.The other thing I really like about this battery is that I have yet seen any corrosion build up, and I have owned the Optima Battery for about a year or so. The price is pretty steep, and probably gives more than what the average driver needs. But for me, I think it was worth the money, and helps me save time by skipping the step of jumping my car every time I feel like taking it out of the garage."
5,You can't go wrong...,No one else could come close to shipping almost 40 pounds for this price. Great product from a great service!
1,Used to be a good product---no more,"My 1st Red Top lasted almost 8 years. The last 2 have lasted less than 12 months each.My buddy works for Costco and he says they have dropped the Optima line, due to so manyreturns.It appears the new owners of Optima are after profit only, not quality.Type ""Optima battery problems"" into Google---the list will go on forever!"
4,Possibly not the best cold-cranking amps,I felt like my last battery did better in the cold starts before it died. Unfortunately this battery does not have any sort of indicator window to see how much battery life is left.
3,Should have gone with the Yellow Top,"This is a great battery, But the yellow top one is better. This battery doesn't last more than a couple times of being drained and recharged. I wish I would have spent the extra $20 bucks and gone with the Yellow Top."
1,"Worthless, no customer service","I owned a 7"" vector waxer/polisher for 2 years. After using it twice, it died half-way through the third usage. Tried to send it back to Vector --- they didn't even open the package. Spend a few more bucks and get a proper waxer... most will last a lifetime. Not this one."
5,"Sing, oh Sing!","What a joy! I am a member of Pastor Goddard's congregation, so I have been privileged enough to sit under his teaching for the last few years. He has always been an excellent communicator, but what he accomplishes with ""I Will Sing of My Redeemer"" is unmatched! What is so great about this book (if I had to sum it up in one statement) is that it unapologetically presents the true gospel of Jesus Christ, with all of its misinterpretations and offenses, leaving the reader quenched of thirst for indisputable truth, for lavished grace, and for unconditional love. I highly recommend that you take the little time that it requires to read this book (as it is easy to read and laced with humor) and be blessed!"
5,Classic!!,This Album truly brought back a whole lot of memories I love the Bass of the Beats and the way AMG can easily talk about stuff that we all can relate to at one time in our lives.
3,REVIEW,this cd is decent the movie contains street ball from rucker park and many other street courts bound to play ball this cd unfortunly isn't as great as the movie but is by AMG and if i were you i wouldn't burn or spend money on not worth your time but maybe burning.
5,very good binocular bag,"I have an old world War 11 era pair of binoculars and leather bag which has long been too dried out and weak to use with the binoculars. It was difficult to find a size match replacement bag because more modern binoculars are smaller as well as the carrying bags they use. This Steiner Binobag fits like a custom made binocular bag and is much lighter, making it easier to carry and use my fine old pair of 7x50 binculars."
1,Disappointed in the book,"This book covered only a few of the many tipping questions I had. It covered only the most common examples such as cabs, hairdresses, waiters, bellhops, etc. - where most people have a good idea. There was literally no information on tipping in other countries which was my motivation for buying a book on the subject."
5,A Wonderful Learning Tool,"These books are a GREAT tool for any physics teacher! It is true that they are very challenging, and sometimes not very pleasurable for the students as they are working through the tutorials, but the reward in the end IS worth it! It is very apparent that the physics education research team at UW spent many semesters putting together these sets of tutorials. I have seen my students retain earlier concepts much better after using the tutorials. This is a must have in any college physics class.Just a warning... these tutorials are ment to be performed in small groups, and typically need a lot of guidence from an instructor or a lab aid. In a class of 24 studnets, there should be at least 2 ""instructors"" or an instructor or and a helper that can guide groups through the process."
1,Physics,this is not suitable for high school. I expected more pictures and there were none. It is not good for a beginner teacher and someone who does not have any background in the subject.
5,Mesmerizing,This unique true-life adventure takes on the wonders and excitement of touring multiple European cities and has a very blunt and genuine southern Texas perspective that makes you want to see what happens to him next. Great read. Hope Author follows it up....
4,My cat loves it,My one cat loves this toy. He will carry it around and play fetch. It has plastic eyes which some people might want to take off in case their cats could chew them off and swallow.
5,Good for calligraphy lovers,This book is a reprint of cooperplate writing from XVIII century.If you like calligraphy you will enjoy it!
2,Time is Noon by P. S. Buck,I did not end up finishing this book because the print was so small that it was uncomfortable to read. I will probably not pick it up again.
2,Buy the originals,"Miriam Makeba was- is an amazing singer but this collection falls short. I would advise older original recording like: Africa, Pata Pata, even Live from Paris. You won't regret it."
4,Very nice,"Buy this just for tracks 1,4,15 and so on. To hear the early version of this voice is a pleasure in it self. But to hear the growth and development of an artist of this caliber is a rare treat indeed. Oh go ahead you know you want it."
2,Don't Purchase This CD for Pata Pata,"When you play the Pata Pata ""Sample"" for this CD, you will hear the popular ""Hit"" version. However, when you play the actual CD, you will hear a completely different version. In my view, this is very deceptive!! The primary reason I purchaed this CD was for the ""Hit"" version of Pata Pata. What a disappointment!! However, I do like many of the songs on this CD and will not return it. Please be warned. Do not purchase this CD for Pata Pata!"
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I was expecting to hear some of the old songs with the same arrangements and backup bands. I was surprised to find not one single piece the same as I remembered. If you have no comparison, you would probably enjoy this gifted songstress. I found the quality overall to be disappointing."
1,Disappointed,"I was glad to find you had a heatsink that I was looking for that met the specs I needed for my motherboard and cpu. It was received very promptly, in a matter of days. But, it seems the heatsink did not fit after all. So, I am returning it and will have to go elsewhere to buy another one."
1,Vaio Premium Horrors,"I was reasonably happy with my premium SZ260P despite some misgivings about the keyboard and the heat generated by it.Within four months, keys on the keyboard have begun to fall out. Problems with the spacebar have been well documented...all in all, the build quality has basic design faults despite the beautiful screen and efficient processors etc.Given that the new Core 2 range also use these keyboards, one couldn't recommend VAIO SZ's as long as the keyboard is made so cheaply. Also watch out for the fact that despite the thinness of the machine, the AC adapter is gigantic!"
1,careful with electric shock,"This is a nice machine except for the fact that when it is plugged it gives an electric shock to the user. Please search your favorite engine with ""sony vaio sz electrick shock"" and you will see that this is a common event. In the next month or so I will try to see if this machine can be returned to Sony and/or file a complaint with my state's attorney general. This is completely unnaceptable."
3,Does what I expected but not for the sweetener user,"Works great for sugar pouring, but for those of us that use Splenda or other artificial powdery type sweeteners, it won't pour due to the weight of the metal piece on top :("
2,Not the best.,"The little pouring flap is poorly made and doesn't look like it will last, but that's not really important since the glass part of the sugar container arrived cracked to pieces. Sent it back."
1,Not as I had hoped,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. Sadly, the sugar flap does not lie flat or close. Also, I was hoping that it was made in America. It clearly has ""Made in China"" on the bottom. I am returning it for a refund and will continue my search for something of better quality."
3,Nostalgic,"Takes me down memory lane and reminds me of the sugar pourers I used to have to fill at the coffee shop I worked at many, many years ago. Also does a fine job dispensing sugar."
4,Mix of Indian Ragas and Trinidadian Calypso,"Mungal Patasar, a Trinidadian sitarist, joins forces with a great band of Trinidadian steel drummers as well as his own son, who plays the tablas. Trinidad is known for its calypso and soca music, as well as reggae, each of which appears in fine form here. What makes this album unusual is Patasar's ability to integrate the sitar into these Caribbean music forms and to interact with the steel drummers to create harmonies and melodies unlike anything ever produced on any album. Patasar studied classical sitar in India for many years and employs his knowledge of the instrument to bend traditions. The Steel drummers also appear in good shape here, and provide a taste of what can be done with the ""steel pan""--a multitimbral percussion instrument invented in Trinidad decades ago."
3,Good beats,"There are some good beats on this album. It was too slow at times though. Other than that, good sound and rhythms. I heard this on a cruise to Jamaica, and bought it to remind of the Jamaican atmosphere. If you like island type music you should get this. It is good for a dance or party with a island theme or if you just like this type of music."
3,Review and question,I remember reading this book as a child and I read the cover off of it. I was wondering does anyone know if there was a follow up to the book? Why do I think there was one?
2,I think I missed something!,"I found myself extremely excited to find a book by hodges after ""Gilbert Grape"". I finished the book dissapointed. The book was so much focused on naming products from the era that it lacked the crucial parts of a good story. I was expecting a website on the back cover that would direct me to a site where I could by memorabilia from the 60's & 70's. There was potential for a great story but I do not believe it was developed. This book is great for those who want to take a trip down memory lane (sort of like flipping through an old yearbook)."
5,my fave book on earth,"This is my favorite book on earth. It makes you cry and laugh in the space of one page. The best, buy it!"
2,Where's the plot?,"The author does a good job with the character's in the book. He really drew me in. I kept reading to see what was going to happen and then ... nothing did. The character's were great but the plot wasn't there. I was waiting for a climax, then all the sudden I was on the last page. Frustrating, because it could've been really good."
4,"Poignant and often moving, with precise '60's feeling","If your experienced a 1960's childhood in the Midwest, you'll find a lot to connect with in this poignant and often moving story of a 7-year-old boy struggling to emerge unscathed from a troubled home and unpredictable neighborhood characters.I was especially touched by Scotty Ocean's relationship with his estranged mother, who leaves her family without warning and spirals downward through alcoholism, within a stone's throw of Scotty. The exchanges between Scotty and mom during her random and unsettling visits are laden with meaning and emotion."
4,A Good Commute Book,"Not as large or as devastating as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" Nevertheless, a worthy read. The scenes that mark the milestones of Scotty Ocean's seventh year make for delightful quick reads--ideal for train riders and carpool passengers. The episodic nature of the novel, in fact, is part of what makes the 7-year-old POV so convincing. Minor and major traumas and victories are given equal attention and equal weight....there is no sense of ""proportion"" in the mind of a second grader. While this is a wonderful accomplishment, I look forward to Hedges return to the adult world--he's a wonderful painter of off-kilter emotional landscape, and Scotty, though he is lovable, isn't the kind of character with whom I can identify and commisserate (as I did with Gilbert)."
4,Author Peter Hedges does a great job with this book.,"I was most intrigued by the movie, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" - also written by author Peter Hedges. Because of this, decided to get ""An Ocean in Iowa"" to see what else this author could crank out. To my delight, the book was a marvel. Little Scotty Ocean is one cool, introspective kid. The story reads from a 7 year old's perspective and some of the cute and ingenious things this kid thinks about are incredibly witty. I like the fact that in this split-up household, neither parent is held out to readers as a failure. Both parents are lovable characters, even though flaws are apparent. I looked at the picture of author Peter Hedges on the bookjacket and really wondered if Scotty's character was partially based on Peter's own perception of things when he was a kid. Peter Hedges eyes tell it all; he looks to me as I'd pictured Scotty. Great story Mr. Hedges."
3,Recomendation of An Ocean in Iowa,"The story started off well, capturing my interest by developing the characters and giving background about the family. My favorite thing about the book is that has many fun flashbacks that give us a better understanding of the characters and their past. It doesn't take long for the author to present us with the main conflict in the story. We learn that Scotty's mom leaves the family and we see throughout the book how he struggles to get her back. There comes a time in the story though that it seems like nothing happens. The plot sort of just stops right were it is and it become rather boring to read. Overall it was a decent read I would recommend it to those looking for a leisure book rather than a mandatory reading."
4,Great product.. just not for me.,"Looking for a new messenger bag for work so I bought thism, liking the backpack option. I LOVE the number of pockets and the product itself seems qute durable. If you get the XL it can almost double as a suitcase which is great if you commute or bring a lot of items with you to and from work every day.After looking at the product further it seems very similar to my current bag so I am returning this particular one for something different.Nothing wrong with the product though and it would be a great fit for the right person!"
5,Excellent product,My husband loves this bag. It is durable and roomy. He loves that it can be carried as a backpack or over the shoulder.
5,great,sometimes when you orderthings like this online you think your gettin one thing then are disapointed this bag was well worth it. fits my 17 inch widescreen perfect and all that i have to carry. love the bag and recomend to anyone.
3,Nice classy finish but breaks like any wood toilet seat.,I love the classy white finish but I wish it is made with a sturdier plastic material. This is the 2nd time my husband broke the seat.
3,Good...,"...but not as good as I Should Coco, I think. A lot of the songs are kinda impenetrable, but all is forgiven by the singles Late in the Day and Sun Hits the Sky. And the bonus CD, while also inconsistent, features a few genuinely great b-sides (not ""unreleased tracks,"" thank you) in Nothing More's Gonna Get in my Way and 20-Ft Halo. Worthwhile."
4,In my top 5 of all time,"Without a doubt one of the best feel good albums of the decade, up there with the Manics and Stereophonics they kick everyone elses sorry butts"
5,This is a must have album for 90's indie rock,"This album was the first that I ever heard of the Archers of Loaf. As soon as I listened to it, they hooked me with the incredible melodies, versatility, and Eric Bachmann's crooning voice. I soon bought up all of their albums - Vee Vee, The Speed of Cattle, Icky Mettle, and White Trash heroes...all of which are excellent albums and have great songwriting. I've also seen AoL a few times live and Bachmann's new project, Crooked Fingers - great live shows. I've had all of these other albums in regular rotation over the last 7 years and just last week I happened upon the first album that turned me onto them, All the Nations Airports. It was like hearing AoL for the first time, it truly is an amazing album. Highly recommended."
2,Heartbreak,"This is the album that removed the Archers from their spot as my favorite band and made me stop attending their shows. The catchy, fast-paced guitar rock of Icky Mettle, Vs., and Vee Vee is virtually nonexistent on Airports. Although the first three tracks are brilliant, the album deteriorates into Bachmann moaning and moaning in his less-than-appealing mumble. This album made me feel almost as betrayed as I felt when U2 produced Zooropa."
2,Dissenting opinion?,"I feel so guilty bad-mouthing music recorded in Wisconsin, but this sadly fits in with my veritable stockpile of so-so just-above garage band rock albums. In fact, my friend the punk afficionado was getting rid of it, and I had to rescue it from becoming a colorful wall hanging. This album does not deserve decorative adornment of a dormitory wall, but it does precious little to make one want to take it down and play it."
3,Good harness,This harness appears to be well-constructed and is moderately comfortable to wear. I would have liked to know that it was made in China - this is not a European product.
3,O Brother Where Art Thou,"Last time I checked, an a capella song did not include a guitar part to it, which just might be the reason that ""Down to the River to Pray"" was not included in a guitar tab book... So don't complain about something that stupid, people. You're buying a freaking guitar tab book, so expect it to have guitar tabs in there!"
1,O Brother Where Art Thou,"Disappointed to find the accapella song, ""Down to the River to Pray"" was not included. I assumed since it was a book of the music from the movie it would be complete. Waste of my money."
3,Don't buy this doll here!,"Seriously, as the other reviewer said this doll is much cheaper bought somewhere else. I prefer the Takara doll makeup over Ashton-Drake personally but the hair on these kind is excellent."
5,"This album has ""SISTER CHRISTIAN""!","Boggie Nights is a terriffic sountrack! FOUR stars! But, the song ""Sister Christian"" carrys it into the 5 star catagory. ""Machine Gun"" is also a great song, and this one has Marvin Gaye, folks!"
4,Great fun!,This is the sound you're looking for when getting into the 70s mood. The album is especially good because it's not a standard off the rack 70s sampler. The whole is larger than the sum of the parts!
1,Didn't feel it...,"There are a lot of great songs on this CD, sure. But I only wanted one: Dirk Diggler's ""The Touch"". 'Nough said."
2,Boogie nighs soundtrack,Me personally I don't like it but the movie is pretty good. My husband likes the cd.
4,Boogie Nights is a great workout cd.,Love this cd. My children are 20 and 24; they took my cd so I had to order another one. I don't think you will be disappointed.
5,I really like this soundtrack!,"The songs that I wanted were on this disc, and I love every one of them. I highly suggest this album if you are looking for hits such as, War - Spill the wine, and ""Livin' Thing""Good choice."
2,Driver's Seat,"Where the heck is Sniff n' The Tears' ""Driver's Seat"" in this soundtrack. It plays at a definite changing point in the movie where Floyd comes to tell Jack that he needs to switch to video instead of film. It's a travesty that this song wasn't included. But a good soundtrack nonetheless"
2,Not a good movie track CD...,"In a few words: I saw the movie but the CD does not have the spirit of the movie. The CD is some kind of cuts of some music that appears on the movie, sorry for Eric Burdon and WAR, but somebody does not know about music... If you listen CD's of James Bond movies for example, you will noticed that there is a relationship between the CD and the movie.. but with Boogie Nights... is not the case. Excellent movie, very bad CD..."
3,"Where's ""Sniff 'n' the Tears""","This soundtrack doesn't include one of the best songs from the movie, ""Driver's Seat"" by Sniff 'n' the Tears. Only 3 stars due to this flaw!"
5,wunnerful!,This is definitely a weird mix of music ... and that's why it's so wonderful! Come on; Night Ranger and the Commodores and Walter Egan on the same album? Crazy and fabulous. This is music to bring a smile to your face and remember those good old crazy days. Enjoy!
1,Buyer beware,"When they don't list the ARTIST by the track listing, we should know that they didn't go to the effort (or money) to get the real artists. This happens FREQUENTLY on 'collection' CD's."
2,Untitled,"These are not the original songs from the movies; rather, they are inferior remixes. Very disappointing."
1,oh please....,"100 pages devoted to who's going to take the trash out and half again on how to manipulate and coerce and, finally, how to play golf as a replacement for good old fashioned sex"
5,Excellent,"These cookbooks are excellent for anyone who wants to enjoy authentic Nonya Cuisine. My favorite dishes are ""Chicken wrapped in Paper"" and ""Curry Devil."" These dishes are delectable and the directions are easy to follow. Even though I love cooking I do not have much experience cooking Asian cuisine. What I find most difficult about Asian cuisine is that I am unfamiliar with the ingredients and I don't even know what most ingredients look like. However, with both of these volumes at my side, I was able to go into my grocery store and get the ingredients I needed because each book has a photo glossary of all the ingredient that are needed to make every dish. In addition, the cookbooks are truly beautiful; every recipe has a final picture of what the dish should look like as well has useful tips and basic cooking techniques to make sure that each dish is authentic. I highly recommend these books to anyone who loves Asian cuisine."
4,Review of Mrs Lee's Cookbook,"After a recent trip to Malacca, Malaysia I became acquainted with Nonya cuisine, which is a fusion of Indian, Chinese and Malay cusine, reflecting the ethnic make-up of Malaysia. This is a beautifully presented book with some excellent recipes from the kitchen of Mrs Lee (mother of Singapore former Prime Minister) and a lovely souvenir of the region.Linda Pilling"
1,"if you want your laptop/pc to stay in one peice, don't buy this!","the product must be hooked up to a computer. since we only have laptops, my son has access to their keyboards when he plays with this... we've already lost a few letters for typing, and they can't be put back. don't want to think what would have happened if he would have swallowed the keys.my son is 13 months. he can activate the controls and all, but gets bored very quickly - and then goes straight for the laptop.i think it would be even more boring for an older child. I only have the first disk that comes with the controls, so maybe other disks are more interesting (I should hope).it's good for 5-10 minutes of activity, but the damage to the laptops is not worth it."
4,My son loves this!,"For Christmas, my mother bought this keyboard for my son. He was just a few days shy if his first birthday. Since he is always fascinated by Mommy and Daddy on their computers we all thought this would be a good idea. He absolutely was fascinated the first time we put this in front of him. I completely agree with previous people that the software that comes with this is basic. It is completely age appropriate for him since he's 1, but I couldn't imagine in 6 months this software keeping him interested in the slightest. For now though, it does. We do have the additional software as well and my only complaint is for the ones with an overlay I have to physically tape them to the keyboard for him to play with them. Once he's older that shouldn't be necessary but try to explain the logic of an overlay to a 1 year old is not really an option."
1,Bad Quality Bad Customer Service,"I did a lot of research before purchasing this computer. I read a lot of rave reviews,but was greatly dissapointed! First it was great (1 week), then we had problems, it would show upside down on the screen, we fixed that, then we had no keyboard, the cd itself worked. I have written twice to the customer service over the span of 7months and I still haven't got a response. I would call, but no number on their website. go with Leapster instead, don't waste your money."
3,My daughter loves it!,"This toy is definately different. My 2 year old daughter loves it! She plays with it several times a day. It keeps her interested for short bursts. Not really something that should/could be used without supervision. I thought it would have a lot more to interact with, but all in all it is a pretty good toy. Wish it had more keys!"
4,Watch and realize why there is so much said about him...,"Video has some footage of Senna's early go-cart years, interviews with mechanics, and nice 80's and early '90s Formula 1 images. Not to speak about Senna himself, in some almost intimate interviews. Great. Would be better if brought more go-cart and formula Ford images... But still great, a must for any car racing fan, Formula 1 fan or not, Ayrton Senna da Silva supporter or not. Watch this video and realize why there is so much writen, said and discussed about this genious. It doesn't show the dark side of Senna (victory at any price), but still a must. And it makes current F1 starts look so... insipid."
3,Flashback: When we enjoy motor Racing,"This video does include Senna's principles of racing, not only on the racetrack, but at home in his beloved Brazil. My approach to this Video is similar to my feelings through Ayrton's career:an unfinished masterpiece.It has on the other hand great footage of racing incidents, including a Pole earning full onboard lap from Senna's car in Monaco¡¡¡It avoids to show the darkest moment of the late champion: his crash with Prost's Ferrari in 1990 not to talk of the 1993 season that many of us regard as his best season ever."
4,A true racing legend,One of the best videos of a great race driver.From his child hood to winning his 3 F-1 world championships.I cant wait for his other documentary scheduled to be released on dvd.
3,enjoy the music and the time period,"I am a big fan of Brian Jonestown Massacre and got interested in the Dandy Warhols fromthe documentary DIG! They have many great songs, but still like BJM better."
5,Love can be even better the second time around ...,"Rekindled is a rare & delightful love story. While most romances (which I greatly enjoy) are stories of people meeting and falling in love, Tamera Alexander takes a different, refreshing direction. She pulls us deep into the lives of Kathryn and Larson Jennings, a couple married for ten years, and shows how God can take love even deeper--""rekindling"" it--even when every outward sign indicates their love, and marriage, are over. This was an amazing first novel, and I greatly look forward to reading more compelling stories from Tamera."
4,"Quick-Moving, Intriguing Plot","After ten years of marriage, Kathryn Jennings longs to know her husband Larson more deeply, but his insecurities about his past and his alienation from God prevent the couple from connecting at a soul level. Through a dramatic event and an unwelcome separation from his wife, Larson is forced to reevaluate his priorities, all the while wondering whether Kathryn will still love and accept him when he returns, changed beyond recognition.Rekindled is the story of two individuals responding to the true Lover of their souls and allowing Him to fan the spark of their romance into an undying blaze. Tamara Alexander expertly balances the novel's quick-moving, intriguing plot with the complex emotions of the characters, but she wraps up the ending so tidily that readers may not be enticed to read the second and third books in the Fountain Creek Chronicles series."
3,"The good, the bad and the unclear","This book started out great. I enjoyed the character development and even the character flaws. It was well written albeit somewhat unbelievable. But the part that bothered me the most was that it almost seemed as though the author met her word quota and simply decided to end the book. No transition, just an abrupt ending which didn't answer all the unanswered questions. I mentally wrote my own ending which was much, much better. It could have been a five star book otherwise."
5,refreshing!,"I picked this up, not knowing what to expect, but it was an extremely well-crafted novel!! The plot has already been well described by other reviewers, so I'll just say that it was very well written and a refreshing change from so many cliched plots. I definitely felt for both the hero and heroine, and the element of faith was carefully woven into the story, but not in an overpowering way. It's nice to read a good clean romance novel that can address faith without beating you over the head with it. I enjoyed reading this book very much!!"
5,Loved it!!,"This book was awesome!! It was a page turner to the end......I actually had to force myself to go to bed one night because I wanted so desperatly to see how it ended. This book is a true love story if ever I had read one, with God so embedded that you can't deny it. I will be reading more of this author in the future!"
5,One of the best written books I've read,"""Rekindled"" is one of the best written books I've read. Ms. Alexander's characters are true to form and very realistic. I found it difficult to put this book down, as did one of my friends whom I loaned it to after I was finished reading it. I am looking forward to reading ""Revealed"" and the third book in the Fountain Creek Chronicles series as well. Ms. Alexander brings this story to life and includes an excellent insight into the characters' faith. As a matter of fact, her own strong faith shows through in her writing. This book is a must for any book collection!"
5,A stunning debut!,"Rekindled is a wonderful, rich story about faith, love, and loyalty. Tamera Alexander has written a book that leaves the reader well satisfied. A must read for historical romance fans!"
2,disappointed,I was really disappointed in this book after all of the excellent reviews. I feel that the Christian references on almost every page overwhelm the plot and made for a cumbersome read. Subtle illusions to belief might have been more effective. I stopped reading a little over 1/3 of the way through.
3,"Way too long and repetitive, though an incredible plot line","The storyline was amazing, which is why I was determined to finish it. However, it was unnecessarily long and repetitive. I loved Larson's character, though he frustrated me with his many assumptions. Kathryn was a little bit too picture perfect. I think it ended abruptly, though I wasn't sure how else it could've ended. I really appreciated the message."
5,"The undiluted, untammed Gato!!!","This and ""Bolivia"" are my favorite Gato records. I have been listening to this one since it came out in the early 70's. It doesn't age, is a classic. Here you find the loud, untammed ""gato"" with a lot of drive. The sidemen are awesome: Lonnie Liston Smith, Ron Carter, Joe Beck, Lennie White, Gene Golden and Nana Vasconcelos. All tracks are great and cover a wide spectrum of Latin American stuff: Brazilian, Argentinian and Caribbean. My favorite is ""Carnavalito"". A must for early Gato fans."
1,dude get somthing else like the longest yard,this was a total let down not only was it stupid it had no point if you are goning t get somthing get somthing like tghe longest yard that is the best movie for psp they have peace out
2,Item received did not match picture when ordered.,"The case I received did not match the picture you see with this review. Also, when I clicked on the original picture prior to ordering, it did not match the item I received. The pictures showed a blue case with attached water bottle which I did not receive. The case looks good but I am not pleased with the pictures not matching what I received."
3,"Good music, but a little uninspired.","I really love the tracks ""Sky"" and ""Private Roots"" (I heard SKY on the Drone Zone radio station), but the other sogns on this album feel a little flat or ununspired. Of course with any form of ambient music, the non-fan listener will become easily bored. So it's not really boredom that I'm complaining about, but instead just a lack of a specific mood or atmosphere.To see what I'm saying, head to subsource.de and try out submix026(free), a very chilled out downtempo mix, and you will see that the music & instruments are very similar but the atmosphere in ""Clear Future"" is a little more defined: urban, nighttime, classy, tight, compared to this ""Private"", which has a more scattered feel but with a few well-defined tracks as mentioned above."
2,looks better than it feels,"These slippers look great, and have good quality materials but are not very comfortable. There is absolutely no arch support - it feels as if you are simply walking on concrete. I would NOT recommend these to anyone and had I tried these on in person, I would have not bought them."
3,Good--sort of,"These are great slippers--well made, nice looking (for old guys) and warm too. The price was right as well. However, the ones I received didn't match. One was wide and the other was noticably more narrow. Fortunately the slippers were both the same length so I kept them and hope the narrow one will eventually stretch out enough to look like the other one. Besides, walking around in mismatched slippers is kind of funny and good for a laugh."
3,Tamarac Slippers Cheap at a Price,"I wondered why Amazon could sell these slippers so cheap compared to other outlets. The reason appears to be that the slippers are factory seconds, but really what else could you expect for the price. I feel that I got what I paid for, but it would have been nice to be informed about what I was buying before the fact."
5,MY HUSBAND LOVES THESE SLIPPERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My husband is so happy with these slippers. Totally top quality for the price.
4,Fun but hard,"Command & conquer Red Alert is a game I usually play at my friends house. Its a pretty fun video game. If you like strategy games which makes you think you will love this game. Its really hard as well. You can choose your country and have an army. You start off with $10,000 and you buy things that will keep your base safe because the other country is trying to kill you and destroy your land. You must get lots of soliders and good buildings and planes and lots of other things in order to defeat them."
3,Dated,"Unfortunately I got this as a gift AFTER already playing the new Tiberian Sun version of C&C. While this game might have been state of the art 3 years ago, now it appears dated. So if you're deciding on this versus Tiberian Sun, go with Tiberian Sun."
1,unfair,"the game is good..excellent strategy game...so why one star?.the game is made UNFAIRLY. The russians are way much stronger and powerful than the allies. Eventough by playing on the allies side is very challenging, the fact that the game is made unfairly and so i gave it one star.the best is still the original C&C by westwood."
5,Command & Conquer: Red Alert,"Of all the strategic games I have ever played, I'd have to say Command & Conquer Red Alert is the all time best. My reason for liking this game so much is that it kept me excited and occupied the whole time I played it. There seemed to be an endless amount of scenarios and endings to each campaign. But the one feature about the game that I liked the most by far is the Skirmish Mode, which allows you to play the computer on one battlefield to conquer eachother's base. I also enjoyed playing over the internet against human players, which gave me a sense of actually playing another person with different strategies and skills. The way it allows you to build your own base and conquer others gives you a sense of complete control over what happens next. You can control individual soldiers or a group of tanks, men, and aircraft to attack enemy structures. If you are a big strategic game fan this is a must have. You won't be dissapointed!"
3,"Good Game, Some Problems","I've always like this game. It tends to be one of those I choose to play whenever I want a game to just relax with. I tends to create my own maps and that makes it more enjoyable. One thing. The game will, on occasions, playing user designed maps, just lock up. This shows up as an ""illegal operation"" and you can usually hit ESC and then tell Windows to close the game. I tend to play this game under Win98se as it runs better under that OS. It will runs under XP, but not very well and the lockups seem more numerous there. This doesn't totally keep the game from running, just really creates a problem running the self created maps. The campaign game seems to run fine without the lock-ups."
4,"Stunning, but it could be better!","Definatly an improvement to Comand & Conquer. Its great portrail of the worlds history brings out the beauty of the games wonders. Although it coule be much better, it does lack in certain qualities but not many or majoy ones. You would think that the follow up - Tiberian Sun would have tried to follow on Red Alerts great game play but sadly no. It just came up far behind being way to dark and mystereous. Red Alerts weapons, vehicles, people and buildings are just right and not futuristiky which is good. And to top it all off it is just sooooo adictive once you start playing it. You just have to get to the next level, thats why it is so good and worth what you will pay for it."
4,The Best Red Alert Ever!!,"-This is the best version of Red Alert. The Expansion version of this one (Red Alert Counterstrike) is even better!! I have tried many other strategy game by this same company, but the original Red Alert and its expansion is by far the best!!"
3,Red Alert is a fun buy but not as good as RA2,"Red Alert has awesome items like the telsa coils and the mig airplanes and some other EXTREMELY NEAT STUFF! But the game is very fun but not as good as RA2. RA2 Has alot more neat stuff than this does. Now to make Red Alert really fun though, buy Aftermath and Counterstrike. Also the single player missions are fun at first, and are very challanging, I just have to say that red alert to is for people who like the classics and fair graphics games."
1,Crap,"This game was crap, it came scratched. It didn't work with my computer. Now I have no use for it and it was a waste of money. Don't waste your time"
5,Command & Conquer: Red Alert,"My review on this game is biased as I played this game a lot when I was young with my family and it was a huge thing. I can't speak highly enough of this game. It truly means a lot to me personally and possibly nothing to others.The storyline is flawless and the rts aspect of it is quite pleasing. It's a finished game with no to minimal flaws game play wise. The game does lack challenge for the experienced rts, but that's mainly due to the limited AI back than. It's also a unique game and can't really be compared to any other game off the top of my head at least."
2,windows 95 only????,"i ordered this game and 1st of all,its windows 95 only and i got windows xp..and 2nd,on the case it says 2 cd but there was only 1 in it! but i guess that dosen't matter considering i casnt play it anyways.hope i can find a way to return this and get my money back.this was my 1st time doing this"
5,A classic that every aspiring player should memorize!,"This little book may well be the best 8 bucks one may ever spend on a chess book. The authors illustrate all the mates and their variations in well thought out examples and games. If you cannot picture Legal's, Anastasia's, Morphy's, smothered, Greco's (eyc., etc.) in your mind right now, you don't really know them. This is a great book for 1200-1800 strength players and stronger players will have a lot of fun with it, too. This is another great Dover chess book."
5,Checkmate after checkmate,This is one of those books that promises to seal your checkmate troubles and I highly recommend it to beginner/intermediate players.Go through the motions with a real chess set and run through this book for a month or two and you will have people scratching their heads at how you trapped and mated them. This book really helped my checkmates and I am giving it a 5 star review. Absolutely essential for anyone who wants to close the deal with style and deception. I really love this book. It is my favorite checkmating book and I don't believe there is another out there quite like it.
4,Glorious book!!,"(The writer of this review is rated around 2200 and owns above 100 chess books)Absolutely glorious! A great book to have!nicely put together showing time after time the themes that initiate certain tactics.only one minus, it's in descriptive notation, other than that - glorious!"
1,Do not buy this edition,"The Amazon website showed this edition was updated with algebraic notation when I ordered it days ago (now this description is gone). But when it arrived. I found no updates at all. It is still the old descriptive notation and still 208 pages (the same as old edition), not the 216 pages as Amazon states. The copyright dates 2008 not 2009 as Amazon states. But the ISBN number is same as Amazon states.Something is wrong?! Buy the old edition instead, the old one is cheaper, this edition only has a new cover, other than that, there is no difference with the old edition I think."
5,great book,i find myself reading and going back to this book often though you do have to learn the non standard descriptive chess notation but that didnt take long and its useful to know cause lots of older books are written the same
3,Not ranked,Read Bobby Fischer book. Thought this would build on that knowledge. It is not accessible for a casual player. We over my head.
2,Not for beginner's,"I am disappointed in this book not for its content, which I believe is very valuable to the experienced player, but for its average 5-star rating. This book is not for early chess players (even adults like myself). Written in 1953, the notation used is NOT the typical algebraic notation that is basically ubiquitous today. It uses what I think is called descriptive notation - very counter-intuitive to the novice (ergo, the eventual replacement with the algebraic variety). Unfortunately, none of the prominent reviews on Amazon mention this fact!Aside from the notation, the book mires down in historical examples. While occasionally useful to prove a point, this text goes overboard. For a casual player like myself who is looking for a book on endgame strategies, this is not it. I guess I will keep looking, but either find a modern book on Amazon or browse the text myself in a bookstore to be certain I can understand it."
1,bunch of better books out there.,"contents are so basic. you can choose better books at sameprice.if you are an utter novice, pick pandolfini's more chessersize.if notchoose classic 1001s by reinfeld."
2,If you're potty training - pick something else,We bought this for our toddler for potty training. I usually always brings reviews to Toys-r-Us before I buy anything but this was a spur of the moment purchase. This doll smells horrible(my daughters room smells like it now) and she potty's out of her neck. Not great.
1,Fun but Smelly,My daughter received this doll for her 2nd birthday and loves it! However it is extremely smelly. When she plays with it she starts to cough. I have washed it many times and the smell will not fade. I would not recomend this doll.
2,useless for potty training,"Got this doll to aid in potty training. It's really cute, and realistic (except the neck joint is a little wierd), but it wets as it is drinking, and leaks out the joints. The doll is perfumed, which is ok, but they might mention that on the box. The smell is a little strong. The clothes that came with it were a little tight, too. Pretty much impossible for my two-year-old to put them on."
3,"Cute doll, but STRONG lavender scent","My daughter got this doll for her second birthday. She likes the doll, but seems to get very congested if she plays with the doll for any length of time. When we first opened the package, the scent was overwhelming. Any relatives that walked in the room wondered who was wearing heavy perfume.So, if you don't like lavender, don't get this doll. The manufacturer said they are looking into making dolls that are unscented, but for now, not much you can do to get rid of the smell."
3,Fine,"Game was purchased for my 4 and 5 year olds. They love anything car related, so there's not much to complain about for us personally, however I will say that for an older player, the graphics are lacking as is the audio and the car controls aren't as delicate as in other games. Overall, for me, it was a good purchase.(used for around $8)"
1,One of the worst games ever,"Okay, I don't mind the cell shaded graphics. But I do mind the horrible controls, sound, and physics. These cars do not drive correctly. They all sound the same. And steering is for the birds. Save your money and get Excite Truck - it might not be realistic in the physics department either, but at least it is fun."
1,don't waste your money on this port,"Yes, Wii is not about high end graphics, but this game is definitely not maximizing Wii's capability. Graphics is just plain awful. The text is so small that you can barely read. Controls are frustrating. I gave ip up right away, tried Excite Truck -- A much much better and much fun experience. They give you the wheel to sucker you in, don't get it. Excite truck is a much better designed and developed game. What is this? A port from N64!?"
4,Good to have on you,"I keep one with my keys for security. I like that it fits well in my hand. I also like that I can take it off my key ring easily if I enter a building where it's not allowed, like a courthouse. I gave it 4 stars because thank God I've never had to use it, so I don't know if it works as it claims, and I pray I never have to find out."
4,Good Purchase,"We purchased two the these for when we go hiking and camping. Have not had to use it hope it says that way, but it is nice to know we have some protection if we needed it. The size is great to hang on your pack for quick access, and the price is right. I would recommend this product."
4,mace spray review,"Service was very good and speedy for USPS, but the postage costs were very high compared to the actual cost of the product. The 1st one they sent was faulty but they replaced it immediatly on request without asking me to send back the faulty one, which would have been very difficult considering the nature of the product. No complaints in the circumstances."
1,Product did not arrive,I got the crap beat out of me recently. I bought mace. I sent them photos of me after I got attacked. They still just did not deliver the Mace. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. The product itself seems to work just fine. Its the merchant. I have never had to use the Mace but it seemed just fine. The merchant was the problem.
4,works OK i guess,got these for my wife and sister-in-law. it arrived promptly and seemed solid construction. I test sprayed it once and it traveled about 10ft.
5,Worth every penny!,"Before I bought the phone for my parents, my dad wouldn't stay on the phone for more than a minute. Now, we can have a much longer conversation before he passes the phone to my mom. He refuses to wear his hearing aid, so this solution is the next best thing for us, to communicate with him. The sound on the phone is clear, and the volume of the ringing is strong.It's a very good value!"
3,good amplification; poor features,"the amplification is wonderful, and that's the main purpose. I am returning mine, as there is no caller ID and I can not find a redial. I still plan to get another similar phone with all the features."
2,disappointing,"The quality seems fine, they just don't fit me very well. The rise on the waistband is not sufficient to make them comfortable. I wish the old George Forman boxer briefs were still around."
3,No Strings Attached,"A mixed review here. I bought six pairs of these, and one of them has literally fell apart. The threads that connect the band to the underwear just released completely. The others seem to be holding up ok. Maybe just one bad apple but I will let you know if the others fall apart."
2,Roll type squeeze too difficult to use,I thought the squeeze tube with the roll-type tube would make the grout easier to manipulate properly into place. Wrong. The tube fights you every step of the way. As a result you either get too much grout or too little.
4,ALMOST perfect,"I am pleased with this watch. I've wanted a Movado for a long time and this one is certainly affordable. I was a little surprised at the size of the watch face, it's small for a mans watch. It is not 37mm as advertized, it 33mm.The leather band JUST fits on the first hole, and I have small wrists. Men with mediam/large wrist won't be able to use this band. Over all it a keeper, looks very nice."
5,love it love it,"I love my Movado watch. Looks great with a suit and with jeans. I don't the feel of jewelry on my hands and wrist, but I forget the watch is there. Bought it several years ago, still looks and runs great. Great value."
1,What a ridiculous watch,"The face is so small and the band is so short. It's good for a boy or a woman , not a man. I gave it to my wife. What a rip off.Addendum: I realized that [...] sent me the wrong watch. They put the woman's version of the watch in the men's watch box. They'd better resolve this for me next week."
4,Movado Men's Watch,"I purchased the watch as a birthday gift for my husband. It arrived in time and he was very pleased with it - he has been wearing it ever since! It is of good quality. His main comment is regarding the strap clasp which presents a problem in that the stem is not long enough to stay in the hole - it may not be as heavy duty as the leather band. Also, the battery has already had to be replaced after 3 months usage."
5,A great classic style watch,"Bought this for my son, he loves the stylish museum look; he gets complements every time he wears it he says it keeps good time. The face was a little smaller then he thought it would be"
5,Wort buying it!,Its very elegant. Won't hole your wallet :-) I gifted a Movado set to my friend on his marriage. I think I'll buy one for myself too.P.S. I found same watch model at a store in a Shopping Mall. They were selling it for $450!!!
5,Like the good old stuff,"I prefer this to the scented versions available. Also, it is concentrated.The price is very good compared to the stuff you buy at the supermarket."
3,Short but sweet,"Bought this book for my wife, but she said that it Just wasnt what She expected. She expeceded a more involved story."
5,A very very special book,I can't say enough about how special this book is. Must be given to every child by someone who loves them very much.
1,Too sad for me,"I've never liked this story and I had to hear it a lot as a child since it's a ""classic."" The rabbit's martyrdom made me cry every time it was read to me and actually gave me nightmares as a young child. This is one book from my childhood I will not be reading to my son."
5,Give This To Every Child (GrownUp or not) You Know,"My sister cried at the ending of this book, and still does when she reads it to her kids. I don't show the tears, but it has made me more real. It is a deeply tender and beautiful story. This book is the first birthday present I reach for to give to nieces, nephews, cousins. I even gave it to my own parents recently (in a Classic Books basket). The story, like its characters, has a life of its own. The connection is all about love, and these are the authors who open us to the true magic of life and within each of us."
1,Very Bad,This book will drive you insane...the directions are extremely hard to understand.The focus of the book is on mindless duplication of ugly projects instead of learning the tools to create. The focus on detail in the step by step directions is maddening (go to pixel located at x234 y250 and click mouse button three times)This book is a actually harmful to the learning processAvoid it.
1,worst book i have ever read in my life,listen to these directions ..click selection tool..click edit ..paste in front..then move bracket to center and copy text.. !?that's what you're getting here..STAY AWAY..I can't believe teachers use this garbage
4,not great,"i have other nonslip hangers that i got from somewhere else and i thought these would be as good. they are thinner, and actually i pulled a blouse off one and the hanger actually broke. it just snapped ! i don't like the grooves on the top either. they get caught onto your clothes. i would look elsewhere for comparable hangers but if you couldn't find them, then these are ok. just be gentle with them. to this date, i snapped 3 already."
5,Contents,"samplers you can usea handweaver's guide to creative explorationbypenelope b. drookerFrom the back cover: The learning value of making a woven sampler, the excitement of creating a well-designed functional piece - Samplers give you both at once.........Planning & designing many types of samplers and includes a dozen actual sampler projects with complete instructions."
5,Fantastic Toy!!!,"My stepmother gave this toy to my son when he was about 4 months old. Even at that young age, he loved to watch the lights and hear the songs. He is now 8 months old and drags it along as he crawls. He still loves the toy and the more his motor skills develop, the more things he finds to do with this toy. He still can't get the shapes into the holes, but that doesn't seem to bother him. In fact, if I put the shapes into their places, he promptly pulls them back out."
2,Not bad,"I bought this toy for my 16 month old son, who seems to enjoy it, but gets bored with it quickly. I find it to be very annoying, mostly because it does not say the words entirely correct. It pronounces Ladybug as LadybuD. It does the same for a couple other words as well. The difference is not really enought to concern me, but I would prefer a teaching toy, to teach correctly. I would not buy this toy again."
2,ANNOYING!,"This is one of the most annoying toys on the planet. My daughter likes it, but the voice is SO irritating. Worse yet even when she is not playing with it, it ""talks"" and beeps. The best thing about this toy is the off switch."
3,Great Songs! But...,"This CD, musically, has to be one of the best grunge albums I've ever heard. However, there is one huge letdown I wish I would've known before I bought the CD. This album has some of the absolute worst sound quality I've heard and almost isn't worth it just because of the terrible quality. I mean, it's better if you're listening to it on your mp3 player at a high volume, otherwise, I can't stand it.Some of the songs, I've had to listen VERY carefully to hear what they sound like. So, look up some songs of theirs on Youtube. If you think the sound quality can't be that bad, see for yourself."
1,book was in bad shape,"the book was not anywhere near good shape the front cover was torn pretty badly and it was quite dinged up, i was not pleased."
5,a little disappointing,This book was a little disappointing. Of course I'm sure she'll continue in the next book but I wanted to know what happened to Blaze and the other dogs in this book instead of having to buy the other one in a couple of months. I like most of the phantom stallion books although this one defintley wasn't my favorite it was still a good book. In real life I do own a mustang and I might get a wild one soon. I can't wait till the other books come out and I can learn about one of the newer books that are coming out in November and September(Firefly is one of the books names). I think Terri is a very talented writer and I hope she continues writing books. The other book that is coming out is Mountain Mare.
1,Absolute Garbage,"I recently went on a documentary binge and after tons of great shows I came to this trash. I thought it might at least be mildly interesting, but it wasn't even close. The film features random sex scenes with nerds talking about how awful and immoral everything is. Why have very unattractive boring people evaluate sex? Sure they can have their opinion on it, but I simply don't care what they have to say! At one point there is a ugly guy talking about after he gets off watching porn that he feels so bad for the porn actress as she is on her knees in front of some men. Seriously guy? You just got off to that! Why not just stop being a big baby about sex and stop being ashamed of what you like? This documentary is absolute trash and is hardly even at high school project level. Save yourselves the time and don't watch this!"
1,So Bad it's Good? No just bad.,This one really walks the fine line between being a documentary and being straight up anti porn propaganda. The bias is blatant which is one of the few things that I thought were positive about it. The subject matter is all over the place and they can't seem to dig in to any subject at length. Really really bad stuff.
1,BEWARE,Buyer Beware NOT AS PICTURED ... both PC micro store and SF planet do not send the item pictured. You will get the cheap case with a white plastic clip that just hangs from one side and is not adjustable. It is becoming more and more difficult to find the case as pictured with a sturdy clear clip.
2,incorrect picture,"the clip on the picture is nothing like the one i received. disappointed because if ih ad wanted the one i received i could have bought for half the price from another seller. i picked this one because of the clip. the case is very hard to remove and i have to remove it to fit on my timex clock radio/charger. case its self is nice, much better than the old one. the clip screws on and swivels WAY to easliy."
2,poems and pages differ from the 2006 version,"Auguries of Innocence ""to see the world in a grain of sand"" is missing in the edition which I could see online - I bought it as a gift and my friend told me that the pages numbers do not match the description and the index of first lines - which puts the poem on a page that is not there. There are fewer pages than described"
2,Formatting,"Formatting is a key consideration to writing and reading poetry. This edition has no line breaks, and the formatting is very poor. But the text is intact, and how can you argue with free?"
2,Odd formatting for Kindle,"I was looking forward to reading this, but the formatting on the Kindle edition is quite disjointed and makes it hard to appreciate the poems. The poems are not his greatest work, but aren't bad. It's just a shame that reading it is ""disrupted"" by the way it is presented here. Oh, well."
4,this was a Smooth Slow Jam,I dug how Coko&Babyface sung this song. this was a cool Jam Written by Rod Temperton. my favorite line in the Song is give me Everything that R.kelly sings. I co-Sign that Statement Musically as well.this is a Laid-back slow Jam.
4,building to seek out,I spent 2 weeks in Barcelona and only saw one of these buildings. The usual ones are not included which shows that Barcelona has a lot more to seek out. They are opulent and amazing to look at over and over. It reminds one of the power that Spain once was. Not recommended for the casual tourist but for those who are looking for a new set of buildings to admire and love.
4,Glow in the Dark,"I bought this product for my niece who is 9yrs old, for her room because i have them in my daughtr's room and she wanted them. So i decided to get her her own. She is so excited about her stars, and she loves them very much."
4,momof4,"This is a really good product. My kids really enjoyed learning about certain animals and etc.. These cards go with the Quizard Learning System which along with the cards are hard to find at times. It seems it is fading out. Otherwise, it is a really fun and entertaining learning system. I would recommend it to anyone with young kids especially if they love animals."
2,Poor Quality Paddle,"Based on the low price I expected an economy paddle, but these are very poor quality for a product that so proudly labels made in the U.S.A. Not only is the varnish rough, the handles are bound to give splinters they are so poorly finished. Also, one of blades has a split between the joined wood which is bound to crack further in normal usage. About all they are good for is wall art."
3,Good,"It works as advertised, but it leave things behind if you try removing it.you will be in for a clean up if you what to remove it."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"This product seals all gaps and prevents dust and air drafts very effectively. Make sure to measure the gaps to get the right size fit for the foam, so that it's not too thin or too thick."
1,Intermittent Connection Problems,"I'm using this with Time Warner Cable in Dallas, TX. It was intermittent connection issues. It looses the upstream connection every few hours and I have to disconnect and reconnect the coaxial cable. Two months later and it is still having problems. My advice is to buy a different modem. I switched with the SB5101U and am having no problems. The SB5101 is a piece of junk and trying to get warranty repair through Motorola is a nightmare."
3,Cable Modem,Bought this because Time Warner doubled my monthly cable modem rental. Started out renting to be sure service was OK and would keep the service. Bought this modem refurbished. It performs as well as the cable company rental BUT the send and receive lights are always on steadily without blinking. This is an important deficit because I often look and the send and receive lights when I get slow responses to be sure that the communication is going on. I would have bought something different if I had known this.
4,Does not support telephony,"I bought this modem after Time Warner Cable started charging $4.00 per month for the cable modem they issued with the service. I bought it because it was on their list of supported modems customers may purchase to overcome the monthly fee. However, I didn't realize until I purchased the modem I needed support for telephony because I have both Time Warner broadband internet service and digital phone service.This device does not support both.I say this not as a criticism of the product but a heads up to anyone who may be looking to buy a cable modem for the same reason."
4,Works fine,I have Cox internet and was tired of paying the rental fee so I bought this Surfboard. I had to call cox and they reset the stuff on thier end and it works fine.
5,Works Great,"Got tired of leasing my older cable modem with Comcast, and also wondered if I could improve speed. Yup. My internet transfer rates doubled with this modem. Very happy."
1,Dead On Arrival,"It seemed like it would have been a pretty good product. However, I hooked it up and it would not even power on. Hopefully that won't happen to you."
1,Had to Return Product,"Although we were highly satisfied with the item in the first few days, it died within a week. We thought the source of the problem was our cable company, and we tried to troubleshoot with them for over a week. In the end, the problem was with the modem. All of the lights on the unit were lit, yet there was no signal being transmitted.While we may have received the only faulty unit from the bunch, I have no other choice than to say I would not recommend this product."
5,A fantastic cable modem at a reasonable price,I ordered it on 07/23 & received it on 07/28. I paid $39.02 shipped. Installation was a breeze. It took me one phone call to Comcast customer support to activate the modem. The speed improvement is enormous: 20 down and 7 up. Unbelievable. Thanks Amazon for the fast shipping.
4,Motorala Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem,"I am completely satisfied with the SB5101. Set up and installation was fast and easy. I called the cable company and gave them the MAC ID. And couple minutes later, I was online. If only dealing with the cable company was this easy. This modem is fast."
5,Good Motorola Product,Good price for a great product. The extra feature that allows disconnecting the LAN while keeping connected to the WAN is a great security feature.
5,A good choice for my home network.,Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem is an ideal choice for home networking setup. It's easy to install and connect with COMCAST.
4,seems fine,"When I first got it, it seemed to speed up my laptop... but didn't do much for the desktop that was attached to it. May be a little peppier, but seems to have settled to seem about the same as the old Motorola 3000 I had.Oh well..."
3,Must be released,"I haven't been able to try this product. It is sold by comcast and I purchased used from another party. But the unit needs to be removed from any accounts in order to add to your account. I emailed the seller to get it released, but no response. I couldn't believe comcast couldn't figure this out and remove it from any existing accounts so I could use it. Don't waste your money and learn from my mistake."
5,Fine product,Easy installation and works like a champ. Saves money as cable Internet company was charging for rental of same.
4,great modem for the money,I had problems with an RCA modem I was using prior to this Moto modem. I would regularly need to unplug the modem and restart my computer since I was losing the signal frequently. This modem is easy to set up and I have been using it for weeks without a single problem.
4,Appears to be working great!,"Item arrived on time and in working condition. Box was a bit beat up, but nothing was damaged."
5,Simply as advertised,"I've had Motorola modems before and this one works flawlessly, just like the others. Reason for the very-well-priced purchase at Amazon?...to save $10 / month ""rental"" charge by Cox for a product that will probably last 3-4+ years."
5,Great Reliable Modem,"I bought this modem for my cable internet service. It's very easy to setup, connect to a router, and broadcast the service wirelessly if you choose to. I've had no downtime with this router and would recommend it to anyone who needs a modem for new cable service."
4,Seems to be faster than my other modem,"I bought this modem because Comcast told me that was my problem with internet connectivity issues. It was not, but I did find that the internet worked faster with this one vs. my Linksys modem."
3,surfboard sinking,"I bought the SB-5101 surfboard because it had a standby button. Well that was short lived. I have had the thing a few months and the day before yesterday it stopped standing by & stays on all the time. I can't get inside it cause it's glued together. Rather than chop it up i had to add a line switch. Works just as good, but now i'm wondering what is going to go next, nothing i hope. I know you guys can't stop these things from happening, but you asked for a review."
3,Obsolete Technology - Slow on Comcast,"Don't get me wrong, this was a great product for its time. However, it runs DOCSIS 2.0 and the current technology by many providers is DOCSIS 3.0. I used this modem on Comcast for many years and it worked very well until a few months ago. My speed dropped to 5 MB/s download and the connection was spotty. I do NOT think that it is the fault of the modem, but with Comcast's support for it.I upgraded to the SB6121 which is DOCSIS 3 compatible and my speed shot up to about 18 MB/s.Spend the extra $25 and get the newer technology. Let this modem retire in comfort."
3,Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem,I chose this rating because I felt that the description of the product wasn't accurate. I have no problem with the modem as it works perfectly. The problem I had was that it was scratched and didn't appear to be in the just like new condition.
3,Does not work for Cox!,"All,I read the reviews and bought this modem for cox installation, but the cox technician did not accept this product instead I had to buy it from cox.Warning!!Make sure your cable operators accept this, as there are latest products out in the market."
1,Motorola Warranty? Impossible!,"I bought a SURFboard Cable ModemMotorola SURFboard SB5101U DOCSIS 2.0 Cable Modemthrough Amazon less than 5 months ago. I emailed Tech support and was given directions for checking the signal levels. No lights were coming on except PC Activity. So it was obviously faulty. I contacted Motorola by phone per their email response and was given a case number and asked to email or FAX verification of my purchase. I emailed a Word copy of the Amazon receipt. I called back later per their instructions and was told that this was unacceptable because I could have modified it. Motorola wanted the original document, which was an email from Amazon. At this point I went out locally and bought a Cisco modem because I'd been without a connection for three days. Motorola Tech support was a total run around."
5,Works great dont pay cable company rent,Great product plugged in called cable company gave them # off unit it was working that easy. I have 10mb speed it usually runs a little over 10 with this unit for some reason it gets a little over 13 MB like 13.3 or 13.4 extremely fast. good price I recommend it.
4,Replaced my comcast modem,"I purchased this modem to replace a rented modem from Comcast. I opened the box, plugged it in and it works great. No more comcast rental fees. I didn't even need to phone them."
4,comcast cable modem,wanted to save $5 a month on comcast modem fees . Looked online new one was around $60. bought a used one from Amazon for $35. doing great
4,Not Disconnections! Super consistent,"I love this modem! So far I've had it for over a month without any issues. Stupid Cox was charging me an arm and a leg for there so called ""fancy"" modem! This runs fast and does the job! Don't spend your money on a modem just because its expensive. More money does not equal better product. I got this at a great price and it hasn't disappointed me yet! I had a Linksys that I bought and it never worked. The set up is quick and easy. Helpful Advice: Just make sure to call your cable company and let them know you have a new modem because that caused initial problems with set up!"
5,Works well!,"We got the modem to replace the one we were renting from Comcast. When searching for this modem, I just looked to confirm that it was on Comcast's list of approved modems. It was! Setup/installation was super easy. Just called tech support and they walked me right through it on how to complete the installation. I was done in less than 10 minutes altogether. Oh-and my download speeds are just the same as before! So no loss there."
3,Better upgrade to new series,There is nothing wrong with this modem except the fact that it has an upgraded version available that suits the requirements of the cable television.
5,Surfboard Modem,"The Motorola Surfboard modem I bought works exactly as it is supposed to, and the seller, Joo Books, was terrific in their service to me. I would give Joo Books the highest rating possible."
3,Modem is good,Overall this is a good modem but the power button is erratic in behavior. Sometimes you have to press too hard
4,No-brainer expense saver!,Has worked fine as an economical and wise replacement for the monthly-rental from my cable-company. Will pay for itself soon. It's purchase was a no-brainer except for people who still rent their Princess(R) phone from their local telephone company.
4,Perfectly fine replacement,"Our SB5101 was purchased used, but worked perfectly when swapped out for our old (hired) Comcast SB5100. Roughly half an hour of setting up with the company & rebooting a few times & it works just as well as the old one.NB if buying used, be prepared for it to arrive in some primitive packaging (ie. newspaper)."
1,Cable Modem,The modem itself works reasonably well. Unfortunately it came with a cheap transformer plug (120volt to 12 volt DC) which did not work (DOA).
5,Time Warner,This is compatible with roadrunner internet from time warner. I have had no problems with it and use the internet all over my house.
1,"Seller sent used unit, not a new unit as stated on the invoice","I purchased this unit based on reviews. Received the unit promptly and it was packaged very well. All the accessories were their, however, the Ethernet cables would not lock into place. I called Motorola and gave the ssn and they said that the unit was out of warranty. IT WAS USED. My invoice specifically called for a new unit. I called amazon and they immediately took care of the problem with a return authorization and credit for the unit."
4,a used modem,"the modem is on time and works good, but coming without power cable, so i need to find that on another place, its a good price, and works it's most important"
1,Inferior,"The product was inferior and didn't work with my system. I was very disappointed and I had to buy a modem at Best Buy. This caused alot of axiety in my household because my huband uses the same modem for his lap top. His patience wore very thin. By the way, this was a used produMotorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modemct registered in someone elses name. We were never told this information when I bought it.Sharon Pawlowski"
3,crapped out in 1.5 years,"It's sad that Motorola can't be depended on to last much longer than a year. Shortly after a year I began having problems where the lights would blink up to the send light, then blank out and repeat. The cable was tested fine. Took it off a splitter.. hooked it directly into the wall and presto. It worked again. . . for awhile... then the problem returned.I repeated the process and got it working again. .. for awhile... then the problem returned. today it finally crapped out altogether. Comcast suggested while waiting a callback for service that i buy a different modem to see if the line was bad or the modem. I got a linksys and it worked straight away without a hiccup.Conclusion: a very so-so product."
1,UNRELIABLE,"If you use the only modem and connect it directly to your computer or laptop, this is a good modem. But if you try to use it with any other laptop or computer or even a wifi router, THIS MODEM IS GARBAGE. I really dont like this one"
1,Shame shame,"Purchased in good faith and didn't immediately set up service until it was too late for a return.A complete rip off of a product that probably works, but we'll never know since the previous owner didn't officially release it when service was disconnected somewhere in Ill.Leaves me out in CA. Thanks a whole pant load."
2,good purchase,was pleased with the cable modem...it was as stated and pictured. Motorola was one recommended to me and it is working fine.
3,Caution: No phone jack.,"My cable company Cox communications tech support recommended this modem so I wouldn't need to rent one from them. However it had no phone jack to plug in my modular phone cord, like on the rental. Oops!"
5,Works good,"I got this item for a practice, and it works really good. Item arrive in time, new and I am happy with it."
5,Big Improvement in Throughput!,"I recently upgraded my 6Mbps internet service with Cox to 10Mbps, and was dismayed to find that my max downstream throughput was no higher than 5.8Mbps. Decided it was time to refresh my network attach infrastructure, which consisted of a Belkin N1 Router and Toshiba PCX2200 cable modem (DOCSIS 1.0). Switched to an Apple Airport Extreme router and the Motorola SB5101 modem. WHAM!!! Speed test results on [...] jumped to 19.7Mbps! Zero problems installing, and holds the cable signal tighter than a pit bull. AAAA++++"
1,Digital Media Source is CROOKED!!,"I purchased my modem, received it after 2 weeks. It worked fine for about a month then just stopped working. I thought it was Comcast but it wasn't. So, I emailed Digital Media to let them know my one month old modem is bad. Their response, ""Call Motorola"" LOL. No phone number, no suggestions and it took them 3 days to email THAT! AND... when I took my modem in...I FOUND OUT IT WAS A REFURB MODEM!!!! NOWHERE on the item page did it even mention this modem being a refurb!!!!! WATCH OUT!!"
1,used modem shipped as new,"I thought my 3 yr old TWC cable modem was malfunctioning cuz I sometimes got a slow connection. I ordered the Motorola SB5101 [NEW, not refurbished] because of all the 5* reviews...I should have paid more attention to the 1* reviews. I connected the modem per instructions and...nothing. I called TWC and the tech told me his system showed that my Motorola had tried connecting to the internet over 100 times and had failed about 90 times! We tried the usual routine of power off/on the computer [a brand new HP Pavillion] and disconnect/reconnect/ power on/off the modem. Even though all the lights on the modem were lit up...I got nothing. I told the rep I was going to reconnect the old RCA DCM425 they had supplied me with. The TWC rep re-initialed the old modem on their side and I was back watching YouTube videos in about 2 minutes. I'd look elsewhere...such as buying it new from a bricks & mortar store. Lesson? If it ain't broke don't fix it."
3,Great while It Lasted,"Bought this modem brand new 2 years ago and before we had COX cable with no issues at all with this modem, would stay lit up and super fast too! However when we recently moved to DC and switched to COMCAST, we been having MODEM problems where it would reboot about 20 times per day or not reboot for hours. We had strong signals but the modem kept acting up so we finally caved and payed the outrageous rental fee of $7 per month that comcast charges to use their modem. I dont know if in time we had water damage or something to cause this but it has happend and read the other 1 star reviews it has happend to them, be cautious if its slow or rebooting you might need to reconsider another modem."
1,Motorola surfboard,"Owned this surfboard before and worked fine. This one did not work for me. Couldn't figure out the problem, never had a problem using a modem before."
5,Cable Modem,"My cable company charges $5 a month to rent a modem, so at $58.98 this was a very good buy"
1,Lost signal continually,"When I had comcast install my cable modem, the technician worked with this particular product for 2 hours. It continually lost the signal and would not stay continually connected."
5,Cable Modem,Arrived on time and worked exactly as it should. Takes 5 minutes to set up with your local ISP.
5,As expected,"Works right off the box no setup necessary. Strong signal and ease of use make this cable modem ideal for home and small businesses. I use it with a wireless router and despite having 3 computers sharing the same connection, there is no slow down in performance. A must have!!"
4,A good DOCSIS 2.0 Cable modem,"Hey, it works as advertised. I just wish TWC had been prepared for people buying their own modems. I bought one for my Sister, and the idiot at TWC she talked to told her to immediately connect the new modem even though it took 48 hours to complete the switch, so she had no internet for a while. Once the work ticket went through, the SB5101 came online fine and has worked flawlessly."
5,This works great!,"This Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem product is great! Glad I bought it because it works just fine. Price was right also. Thanks, Amazon"
2,"Works for a couple months, then repeated dropped connections","The modem worked fine for a few months, but then started dropping connections. Have to reboot modem more and more frequently. After researching this, it seems like this is a common problem with this and other Motorola modems? It seems like there is very little competition from others out there, so there are not many other choices? I guess Comcast is not the only monopoly out there."
4,Good cable modem,Brought one for use with comcast. So far so good. Very easy to set up after ignoring the comcast customer service rep's instruction.
2,Not Compatible With Windows 7,"Be aware that Motorola does not have USB drivers for Windows 7. Also, I couldn't install the software using the CD ROM. My new Dell laptop has 1.9 GB RAM available. The install wizard said I didn't have the 32MB needed for install. This also happened with the 5120 model. Contacted Motorola, Dell and Geek Squad. None knew what the problem was."
4,Faithful and reliable,Does what it says it will do. I have had it for quite awhile. For the money it is well worth the expense.
4,Just what I was looking for,I w as looking to replace one I had. It is the exact model and works just like the old one.
2,check this seller before you buy,bought a used internet modem from amazing value. MOTOROLA SB5101. modem belonged to time warner cable. owner closed the account and never returned it. modem would not work on my twc system. by the time i return it it will cost me more in shipping(have to pay both ways without reimbursement)plus cost of packaging etc. twc tech told me they charge $200.00 for it. they will not charge if returned to them. please do the right thing . mac# is 0018CODBF6DC
5,Works just like it should.,I need a cable modem for my cable internet service. This was cheap and it is very reliable. Much better than paying $5 a month for a rental modem.
4,As expected,"I've found the product to perform its function. I'm not very hardware savvy, but it was simple to use; basically plug-n-play. There have been no poor connection issues related to the modem. My current internet provider is Cox."
1,Won't work with a router,"I can't believe the hours I've spent trying to get this thing to function with a router, any router. I actually own three routers, 2 d-links and 1 Apple, and it just will NOT work with any of them. According to the documentation, the modem requires a crossover Ethernet cable (which is pretty unusual by itself). I've tried two different brand new crossover cables plus three regular Ethernet cables and it just doesn't work. This setup worked perfectly prior to installing the new cable modem (my previous d-Link modem died.)Unless your cable company forces this one down your throat, or if you never plan to add a router, I recommend staying away from this one. I'm returning mine tonight."
1,"It is supposed to be the best, alas alak tis not so true","Wouldn't function correctly.Getting service out of Motorola is like pulling teeth, your teeth, by yourself, without novacaine."
5,Motorola Surfboard cable modem,Switched out a rebuilt modem that needed to be reset by the cable company occasionally. This is a GREAT modem! No problems and it is reliable and easy to set up and use. Good user interface.
5,works great,"In 1 month, only needed to reboot it once. Not sure why, but is strong and fast as a cable modem. Easy to install."
3,Must Know Info,"Had major league difficulty with the Road Runner tech because the zeros in the Mac ID number are not slashed, so they had to try various combinations of zeros and ""o""s to find the correct one. Also, using Internet Explorer I had to select ""Compatibility View"" to get it recognize Google.com - all other websites work except Google. (Chrome has no ""Compatibility View"" so I can't get on Google.com with Chrome, but everything else works fine.)"
5,Motorolla Surfurboard Modem,a very solid modem. i previously owned one with no issues and is installing this one in another house.
5,Motorola sb5101 cable modem,"Unit works great, no problems of any kind.I do have a small hint so some one doesn't have to spend long useless time with their cable customer service that takes forever to get to the tech people. If you have a router or even a voip (phone box). Most have built in fire walls. If when installing every thing is on and looks to be working but you can't get online; before calling for help. Unplug the modem, router and phone box if have. Then in order plug back in 1-modem, 2-router, and lastly 3-phone box if you have and this will set you up so the other fire walls won't block the modem. Hope this helps.Best price was found at [...] I looked and reviewed for the better part of three months for modems and price.JW"
4,Cable Modem easy to install & use,"No issues with the modem, and once I contacted the cable provider with the product information, the signal came through without any problem. It would have been nice to have a product manual with it, but I downloaded one off the Motorola web site. I really like the sleep button so I cna shut down the signal when I'm not using it."
2,Long waiting time.,Long waiting period and can not find a way to get in touch with the seller. I tried to cancel with no luck.
2,too may misspellings due to the publisher,"I found this difficult to read, too many misspellings. I downloaded a free copy from [...] and it is much better.Their FAQ states: ""Why are there so many typos in my paperback?We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos. We would really like to manually proof read and correct the typos. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies so that would add hundreds of dollars to the cover price. And nobody wants to pay that. If you need to see the original text, you can download a copy for free."""
1,Misleading author information,"""The Ramayana - Valmiki"" is abridged and translated by Arshia Sattar. The author information does not appear with the book. The author as ""Valmiki"" is misleading.This book is NOT by C. Rajagopalachari as mentioned by few reviewers."
4,"If you're interested in out of body experiences, this is a must-read","Fly alongside Bob Monroe as he intrigues you with engaging stories about his first out of body experiences. Monroe does not ask you to believe in a word he says, but rather only asks that you consider the possibility that you are more than your physical body.Don't take it from him though, his book is intended to enlighten, excite, and encourage you to seek out your own answers."
5,This book will take you to the top of the mountain!,"If you ever wondered what dreams are made of, and how and why the Baby Boomers think like they do, then read this book. Think about it...how about the story of Superman, and of Peter Pan and Never Never land, and of Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz, Plastic man comic books, the super heroes, and on and on and on... where did the ideas come from? This book tells...from where! Out of Body experiences are real and frightening at times. I can't imagine being able to have some control over it...but Monroe claims that you can. Is this in fact the ultimate truth? I got so much from this book that it has changed the way I look at life forever..for the better. Remember, the reader will only take from this book what he or she brings to it. Like so much else in life..come to the river to drink the water and it will quench your thirst....this book has a permanent place in my library, it is the water..........."
3,cool,Great book to start out with if you want some information on what out of body experiences feel like because it's a bunch of stories. there's some better information on the web about astral projection though
2,Good book for it's time. Wrong conclusion by author.,"I read this book many years ago. I thought it was the answer to some of the things that I had experienced (sleep paralysis, floating/flying, extreme reality, etc.). However I believe I now know that ""Lucid Dreaming"" was really what was happening to me. After reading Dr. Stephen LaBerge's 1st book on the subject, I became convinced that OBE's are really Lucid Dreams. Check out www.lucidity.com for more objective info. Then make up your own mind!"
3,Just plain weird!,"I purchased this book because I had heard of Robert Monroe's work with binaural beats: a subject that interests me. I really wasn't prepared; however, for the strange nature of this book which takes a look at numerous ""experiments"" Monroe conducted on his own, personal, ""out of body"" experiences. While the book reads like a science fiction diary, Monroe actually believes in and lucidly describes his journeys. It's difficult to categorize this book but should interest those who have an open mind regarding the world of the bizarre."
2,NOT GREAT - the Style and Content is Self-centered narrative,"I have ordered this book because it claimed to be the ""definitive book"" on the subject, much to my dismay it is a pseudo-scientific babble from the point of view of the author who, had no doubt experienced something like OOB. This book is typical to the myriads of modern, new age, phenomena based books. self-centered and pseudo-scientific. I.e. I do not need Monroe attempting to explain the phenomena. Also his conclusions are mostly wrong. Fortunately I ordered a used copy to save some dollars. Out of body experience can be spontaneous (mostly with children, myself included) and can be induced, read/check(google) the Russian expert M. Raduga on the Internet, or just use meditation techniques, whose main purpose, if done right, for the extended period of time, is to achieve out-of-body travel, at will, at any place ands any time."
2,An interesting book of dreams,"I found the book to be an interesting description of an illustrative man's dreams. DREAMS. Monroe makes a giant leap of faith and disregards any connection towards a logical, believable explanation of the events that occured to him. Maybe he should consider different states of consciousness as possible explanations? Or lucid dreaming? People seem to underestimate the power of the brain to make up experiences that seem incredibly realistic. Most people believe what they so desperately want to believe, whether in an OBE or flying turtles. Whatever makes you feel better. Its just a shame when a man such as Monroe capitalizes on such a desire for understanding."
4,Excellent Book- Probably Not For Beginners,"I thought the personal accounts in this book were incredible. As a guide, however, it is a bit fast-paced. I have projected many times, but always spontaneously. I have tried the techniques in this book and came close to inducing projection on my own, but never could fully project. I think that people should master the art of relaxation and become very emotionally stable before trying these relatively advanced techniques."
4,nice,"nice, very nice indeed:) like it. Monroe describes his travels in very vivid and reportive way. Find it interesting - especialy for people interested in astral travels or lucid dreaming."
4,He's just not that into you...,Don't sit by the phone waiting for him to call... read Jane Austen! Learn how to find the right man to love you forever. Simple lessons learned to make a life time of heartache disappear. Sometime for every girl that is still dating. A must read.
4,Wonderful little accompaniment to Jane's novels.,"This is a wonderful addition to the Jane Austen enthusiest's library. It explains the etiquette and lifestyle of the time, using scriptures from the novels themselves as examples. At the time I bought this, I had only just seen the Pride & Prejudice movie. I had yet to read the novel. I found myself wondering why Elizabeth Bennet was so upset by her sister's elopement. This small companion does such a good job of explaining this and much more. Now I can pick up on many more things in the movie that I missed before that give it more meaning- All the little manners and behaviors that have been forgotten over the years are concisely laid out here, in this tiny book."
3,Average Dog Whistle,"DO NOT GET FOOLED BY THE WORD ""SILENT"" DOG WHISTLE. MOST ON THE MARKET ARE LOUD AND CLEAR~ TO OUR HUMAN EARS. HOWEVER, FEW I HAVE FOUND TO BE A ""REAL"" SILENT DOG WHISTLE. THE SHORTER THE BETTER WITH HIGH FREQUENCY SOUND, AND TRAVELS FAR MORE DISTANCE THAN THE LONGER, LARGER ONES. THIS WHISTLE IS OK IF YOU WANT TO TRAIN DOGS AROUND A HOUSE WITH IN VISIBLE DISTANCE. YOU MUST OBEDIENCE TRAIN YOUR DOG BY VERBAL COMMAND, OR HAND SIGNAL, THEN ADD WHISTLE TO MAKE AN ASSOCIATION WITH THE COMMAND THE DOG HAD ALREADY LEARNED. BY THE WAY, MY HUSBAND IS VERY ANNOYED BY THIS ""NOISE"" I THINK HE HAS A CHIWAWA IN HIM."
1,Not Silent!,"I bought this thinking it would be a SILENT whistle. Guess I was fooled by the ""silent whistle"" description. It's not silent. It's loud, high pitched, and obnoxious. My elderly dad can't hear it, but everybody else I know can. It does startle my dog, but only for a moment and frankly it's not worth the annoyance to me or the neighbors."
4,The continuing saga,"This book continues the storyline started with the Rissa trilogy (""Young Rissa,"" ""Rissa and Tregare,"" and ""The Long View""). After ""The Long View"" comes ""The Alien Debt"" and then ""Rebel's Seed."" This story is of Lisele, daughter of Rissa Kerguelen and Bran Tregare. In many ways Lisele is similar to her parents in personality ... yet without their early harsh years of development. Too, this is the story of Arlen Limmer, son of Derek Limmer and Felcie Parager who were main characters in the earlier books as well. Arlen is even more sheltered than Lisele and this plays out in their interraction and developing relationship. It was good to see a continuation in this series, though we lose contact with many of the earlier main characters in this book."
3,"Easily application, color not perfect",I almost felt like the color had a bluish tint when applied. Other than that the application is very easy especially with the pen tip.
1,Don't but from this supplier-- EXPIRED,The brand is fantastic but after purchasing from this supplier I've noticed all their products are expired. My face broke ou after a few uses and I have been using Ultracalming for over a year now with no problems before. It's best to pay the crazy prices at the stores that supply Dermalogica.
5,AMAZING,"Please try this product if you have sensitive skin. Honestly, I had tried everything- organic, neem oil, everything imaginable-and this stuff works. It is amazing."
2,Rape is not romantic,"Drunken debauchery leads to rape of a teenager. Of course the required guilt comes into play. The hero and heroine spend more time apart than together so it is really implausible that they suddenly fall in love. I know this is the romance genre but c'mon, get a little closer to reality."
2,Not very good at all,"This was Joan Wolf's first novel, and any writer who gets a book written & published deserves at least one star. But, in terms of plot and character development, I'd say this story really shows ""first time writer"" syndrome. This is a romance novel, and therefore I could NOT get over the fact that the hero actually rapes the heroine. He's not much of a hero to begin with (too rich, too controlling, and too spoiled by women). And the circumstances surrounding the heroine's rape! The heroine can't talk or scream because her throat is very sore & she's recovering from flu? And the way she's kidnapped by the hero's drunken friend, while out riding? The whole scenario just seemed too unreal and overdone.I never believed these two people could fall in love with each other after such a beginning, and Ms. Wolf did not convince me otherwise."
1,Well...,"The man was at first upset he'd committed rape... but his friend was worse. He threatened to break her arm if she didn't allow him to deliver her to the 'hero'. And later, the jerk bemoans the fact that he was too drunk to remember 'raping that because of her beauty"
4,Needs new beginning,"I often wish for a different ending in books, but this is one where I wish the author had chosen a different beginning. Couldn't she have found another reason for a forced marriage than a brutal, drunken rape? That being said, the rest of the book is great, if you can suspend your disbelief that the drunken rapist is really a nice guy and concentrate on the development of the love story."
5,"Lovely, moving story","Joan Wolf has the incredible writing skill of turning an ugly situation -- a rape , into a beautiful and moving story of love . The suffering of both the hero and heroine in the process wrenches your heart but you would be touched by the tenderness of budding love and the satisfying conclusion. A highly-recommended read."
1,Cheap imitation,"This product is made of cheap plastic, it is not working properly when tried and it is a nice-looking imitation to the metal openers. Dont waste your time and money and buy the real thing. I returned it as I was sure it will break when openning the next bottle"
3,Okay for cost.,Okay deal for the money but I was hoping for a sturdier product. The teeth are plastic and will not hold up for as long as I would like and you have to be careful. That said it was not $100 and I have opened many bottles with it without any problem.
1,Houdini,Product does not work as advertised. I could not get the corkscrew inserted no matter how much pressure I applied.
5,Great product!!,"It took me a couple tries to get the hang of this wine bottle opener, but once I did, I love it!! It is very easy to use, and so far I have had zero broken corks with it!"
2,Houdini corkscrew,This arrived and it was packaged in a hard plastic case which was scratched so badly I would have to believe this item was not brand new. I was very disappointed because I ordered this item as part of a wedding gift and it looked like crap!
1,hard to use!,i've used several lever corkscrews but this one is really hard to operate! it constantly gets stuck :( i bought it as a gift and every time i'm over for drinks with the recipient she asks me to show her again how to work it - it's really embarrassing!
3,its ok,The unit arrived in a timely manner. The leverage is not as easy as a simple waiter corkscrew. Hopefully it will last longer.
1,I hate gadgets smarter than me!,"And this is one of them - I just can't figure it out. I've gotten corks partially out, chewed a couple up, stuffed one down inside the bollle, sent a bottle skittering across the table, stabbed my finger and, yes, I did get one cork out like magic. I just can't remember how I did it.The directions consist of 3 small drawings I found quite unhelpful."
1,Waste of packaging,"I haven't even used it yet, but I would never have bought this. I got it as a gift. It VERY securely fastened to its 2 pounds of plastic packaging, which you can't do anything with except throw away. I also cut my finger trying to separate it from the tray it was in. Horrible product. And it's made in China. 0/5 stars if that was possible."
3,It's plastic,Seems to work fine. It doesn't feel very sturdy though. Also didn't know it was plastic.
3,Broke so easily....!,"I had one of these that lasted years. I think it was of higher quality. I bought this one in September, it broke in November. Total bummer. Don't waste your money -- these are not as well-made as they used to be!!!"
1,Save Your Money,"Had it 2 weeks and it broke. It looks sturdy but it isn't. It got off kilter and just wouldn't open bottles anymore. For all their advertizing, etc. you would think it would be a better product."
2,Houdini not all it's cracked up to be,"I purchased the Houdini and it worked great--for 5 bottles of wine. On the 6th, the handle cracked completely in half. I thought it was made of metal, but turns out it was just made of cheap plastic with a clever metallic coating. Not worth the money to me if it breaks after a few short uses. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,broke,It looked great. Was fairly easy to operate and then it broke after only a few usages. Don't know how to get it fixed and can't find the receipt to replace it.
2,Failed after a couple of years of use,The gears on this opener stripped after a couple of years of use. Not sure I would get another one.
2,ok,The actual product I am sure was fine. This was the 8th item I bought from amazon this Christmas that was damaged. The plastic storage case was shattered. It was purchased to be given as a gift. Luckily for me I found same product else where ( not broken) for 1/2 the price. I returned this item.
2,Looks like Rabbit but cheap repo,"I had my rabbit for several years and ordered this one to replace it...The other was quite hardy, this is made cheap of plastic, feels like it is going to break everytime I open a bottle which has only been a few times because I thought it would break do not recommend keep looking."
4,corkscrew,bought as gift after previous screw broke(Houdini knockoff) . ..... ..... ..... ............... ...................... ................. ............... ....... ..... ..... ......
5,Must have if you love wine,I have own the same model for the past five years and it has nevered failed me. Recently I brought one for my brother in-law who is even more of a wine drinker than me. He has always commented how easy it is to use and pretty cool looking tool too.
4,Metrokane Houdini Lever-Style Corkscrew,"We have finally found the perfect Corkscrew, the Houdini!! Other wine openers have not lasted and have broken easily! This one is sturdy, and so easy to use. First saw it on TV and ordered it through Amazon and received it within a week. The price was right!!"
4,Houdini corkscrew,"Solid product; very easy to use. My only problem thus far, has been with removing the cork from the corkscrew. Nonetheless, compared with other corkscrews, this one is excellent!"
4,wine openers,Works better than the Rabbit but still requires a little stength on some corks. Very good on most bottles.
3,Mostly plastic with dead weight in packaging,"The Houdini handles are made from cheap, coated plastic. To make the Houdini appear well built for in-store purchases they actually include a piece of concrete inside the plastic case to make it feel like the entire thing is metal. Simply remove the backing and you'll find dead weight. I wish they would have just spent the money to make the handles out of metal instead of wasting the effort in the package. The opener is okay for the price but I doubt it will last that long."
1,piece of junk,This particular opener is a piece of junk. The handle snapped in two before it was one month old. I bought it because I had a previous one that lasted years. What happened? The handle needs reinforcement all the way to the end. We are pressing on it. It could not withstand the pressure. Get back to the drawing board and redesign this.
3,"Buy a corkscrew, get a free rock!","OK, the Houdini seems to work pretty well so far. But here's the thing: hidden behind the glued-in-place cardboard sheet on the back of the case is...a rock. Carefully screwed to the plastic. You can't make this stuff up!I can only assume that the rock is there to make the package feel heavier. (I'm flashing back to Jurassic Park: ""Is that heavy? Then it's expensive! Put it down!"")I'm not sure what to think. It's a) hilarious, and b) somewhat deceptive. I'm actually kind of glad someone is doing this in the world. On the other hand, as a person who stood and held the Rabbit and Houdini cases and scrutinized the differences between them, I do feel duped. But maybe the Rabbit has a rock of its own."
2,Do not buy,Total junk.Cheap and clunky. I have had other cork pulling devices of the same general design and all of them worked better then this unit. The foil cutter does not work either.If this is the brands' typical design; buy another brand.I gave it a 2 star over 1 only due to the fact that it does manage to pull out a cork 75% of the time.
3,Fair opener,"This opener has lasted longer than some of the other openers I have bought. It is a cheap plastic however the nice metal one I bought, broke much quicker."
4,I do love my wine,"The cork is my nemesis. It is the one thing standing between my wine and I so that why I love my Houdini because it makes the removal of the cork so quick and efficient.Without, I've spent wasted minutes messing with a half pulled cork, or a mutilated cork because I angled the corkscrew.To the inventor of this gadget - well done."
5,Highly recommend!,This makes wine opening so much easier and faster. All the tools are right there. Recommend this by far! Great for any gift.
1,Hard to get corks out,"I found this corkscrew difficult to use. The problem was that the lever was not long enough to get good leaverage. I have owned other corskrew of this type that had longer levers, and were much easier to use."
2,"Aesthetically pleasing, but....",It broke after two uses. I was very disappointed. The foil cutter doesn't really do it's job either which may have helped lead to the early demise of the corkscrew.
5,One of the best alternative/rock CD's I've ever heard.,"This is one of those CD's that you buy for a couple of songs but it ends up having tons of great songs. I can listen to this whole CD all the way through without finding one song that I don't like. The music varies a little though, from songs like Doll and then Monkey Wrench. This is a must buy."
4,More of the same solidity from the Foo Fighters,"This album released in 1997 'The Colour And The Shape' spearheaded the rock group into the worldwide rock stage and brought them many new fans in turn. This is rock music with a splash of grunge mixed in. With the album under the stewardship of Gil Norton (who has been in the rock genre industry for a long time) the Foo Fighters have put out a solid album fit for all ages. This is unlike other Foo Fighter's releases and the listener will notice the definite differance within the second song 'Monkey Wrench' and 'Hey, Johnny Park'. This was near the beginning of their career as a band and were just starting out with their signature sound.Other songs that I liked were 'My Hero', 'See You' and 'Everlong'. Rock music never sounded any better - with the new invigorated sound of Foo Fighters."
5,Emotional rock at its best,"Everyone knows the good songs on this album, hey Johnny park, my poor brain, wind up,monkey wrench and my hero. EVERLONG however, is out of this world. I have never listened to rock with such emotion. The haunitng guitar rifts leading to the chorus are only surpassed by the brilliance and emotional plea of Grohl's voice as he screams ""and i wonder..."" Makes me shiver every time i listen to this outstanding piece of art. The only song that comes close to everlong in meaning and emotion is tonight, tonight by the pumpkins. Tough luck Corgan, Grohl has got the edge this time."
2,I've tried to like this for 13 years,"Except for ""Everlong,"" most of the music here just doesn't stick in your head. It all sounds the same: ferocious guitars, pounding drums, urgent vocals. And yet, no tunes. ""Everlong,"" though, is a beaut."
4,"VINYL review, not content","The original CD is about as brickwalled sound-wise as they come. The vinyl is better just not stunningly better. More mid-range and a bit more dynamic, I suppose. Most noteable on songs like ""My Poor Brain"". I will listen to the LP more than the CD (but the bonus tracks on the CD are tasty). Packaging-wise, there is just the cover, no gatefold or anything. Decently quiet vinyl. Cymbals are still plenty bright."
5,Best of the 90's-essential.,"Some other people have done a good job of summerizing the tracks here-most of you know the singles already. But in my opinion, buy this just for ""February Stars"" and ""New Way Home"" which are incredible. Do not pass over this disc-it is the best work FOO has done to date. I have been thoroughly impressed with Grohl's ability to remake himself after Nirvana. After hearing this disc years ago, I began to change my feelings on Nirvana-they DID actually have talent...DAVE GROHL was it!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Killer stuff,"I may be an over-50 geezer but from time to time I like to pop this one in and hear some serious in-your-face rock and roll. So many modern bands these days just dip their toes into the rock waters but these guys jump in with both feet and submerge themselves in its power. I love a good screamer and Dave's one of the best (along with Roger Daltrey and Tom Petty from the old days). ""Monkey Wrench"" just flat tears it up right and ""Everlong"" is one great song. This cd's just perfect when driving home from a hard day at work and you just want to vent."
4,foo fighters at start of their peak,"If you are interested in getting into the foo fighters, then this is the place to start. The underrated gem ""hey, johnny, Park!"" is in my opinion, the best foo fighters song still to date. what this album lacks in rawness from their debut, they make up with emotion and more textured songcraft. the production is very slick, maybe a bit overproduced but the songs show Grohl in top form. A true 90's alt rock gem and songs to listen for besides HJP are Wind Up, Doll and February Stars. A good follow up purchase if you like this album would be their follwing record ""There Is Nothing Left To Lose"""
3,could've been better,"I respect when a band tries to change its sound and evolve, but im sorry i just cant help thinking Grohl sold out on this album. Instead of appealing to his hardcore fans, who loved his first album, he tends to apeal more to the 15 year old girl with unicorn posters. Its not a bad album, in fact it has its good points, one being that they are trying to change, and do something different, and thats fine, but they could still rock while doing it couldnt they? But anyone who owns their first album will note that the name Seattle appears more than twice. On this album the name Los Angeles apears. I think Grohl needs to go back to his roots."
5,foo fighters rock,the main reason i got this album is because my hero is probably myfavorite foo fighters song of all time
2,"good, not great","I just bought this album again. I owned it many years ago but lost it when some one broke into my car. I always meant to pick it up again, I had memories of it being a great CD and finding it re-released with bonus songs was a pleasant surprise.Maybe getting older has helped me appreciate things I once did not have time for, but it has also changed my perspective on a lot of things I enjoyed in my youth. This CD, as with Foo Fighters in general, is only OK, and overrated by many. They have a few hits and singles, but so much of their music is so easily forgettable. I've had all their newer CD's to listen to on our network at work and have never been able to really go through a whole CD. Now going back to this one I can see it was just not as great as I remember. I hate buying single songs, I enjoy owning a whole CD. But if you really do know and enjoy 1 or 2 songs on this CD, just buy the mp3's."
5,Good ole rock n' roll,"I know. Some people can look at this CD and see nothing original, nothing special. But the pure energy and power of the Foo Fighters is amazing. Musically, the music is catchy and radio-friendly while still being unique, innovative and intricate. The Foos somehow make catchy songs without losing the emotion in their music. This CD in particular catches the anger and beauty the Foos are capable of. Heck yeah, the Foos are cool. Get this CD!"
3,Fair CD but doesnt live up to Nirvanas music,"This CD is alright. David Grohl puts too much soft junk in here. Alot of people like me want to hear loud crunching guitars and screaming that Nirvana had. Yes this CD does have that in some songs, but not enough. Monkey Wrench, My Poor Brain, Wind up and Everlong are the best tracks. I just dont understand why they put in meaningless songs like Doll and See You. You will like this album if you like Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana or the Smashing Pumpkins you will probably enjoy this."
5,Kick Butt,"This album is the best I've bought in about 5 years. No question. Grohl, in my opinion, has issued the finest rock work of his career even including his work with Nirvana. Excellent."
3,A very solid album,"The Foo Fighters are not the best band in the world. In fact, they don't even make the top 20 bands from the 90s in my opinion, BUT they do occasionally come up with some solid rock music that can get me through when I'm bored of listening to the ""classics.""I haven't heard the last couple of Foo Fighters albums, but this is the best one I've listened to. Everlong is a really good song, and My Hero is another. If this was a tribute to Kurt Cobain, it was a pretty good one."
5,Really great album.,"These are the classics. Yes, the songs that so well defined my adolescents. Like, ""My Hero"", ""Everlong"", and ""Monkey Wrench"". I can still recall in vivid detail the first time I ever saw the music video for ""My Hero."" I remeber being blown away. The Foo Fighters are essential ninetys rock, and for those of us who have fond memeories of those days, The Colour and The Shape is an esstenial."
5,The heart of good music.,"The Colour and the Shape is the album that began my adventure into rock and roll music. With everything from hard screaming guitar riffs in ""Monkey Wrench"" to beautiful acoustic guitars in ""Walking After You""...This cd has something for everyone. As with all Foo Fighter cd's, you can expect a nice blend of hard rocking songs, mellow ballads, and every form of Dave Grohl's exceptional singing voice. (The reason Kurt never let him sing is beyond me.) This cd will become a perfect addition to any rock fans collection, and will live in your minds forever.Familiar Songs: Everlong, Monkey Wrench, My Hero, Hey Johnny Park."
2,very bland album,"After the grunge scene died down, some bands decided to ride the cotails of previous great acts and deliver a watered down version of music that used to have some passion and emotion going into it. The Foo Fighters can be catergorised as ""grunge-lite"" - harmless almost dancible tunes that will not offend anyone and are sure to be played in every radio station around.When listening to this, I cannot say that it is a terrible album. The band does know how to write some catchy music - ""Everlong"", but these songs are too harsh to be pop, to weak to be considered rock and they lack the bitterness of grunge. I am reminded a lot of Silverchair's 1st three albums as they are very similar to this - neither of those making any impression on me at all.In the end like many bands this music falls into the ""cute"" category - read: background music."
2,Decent,"Foo Fighters are all right, but the overall problem with them is blandness. How do you work with Kurt Cobain and churn out music so boring? Didn't Kurt play Dave any Sonic Youth albums? Not to mention the horrible sound quality."
2,lame,This album is totally middle of the road whether it be the boring and unimaginetive guitar riffs or the one dimensional lyrics and vocals of Dave grohl. Everlong is an instant classic but nothing else here bares repeated listens. Stick to your Nirvana and Pixies albums.
2,Disappointed,"Bought this thinking it would have the quiet, melodic version of Everlong. It doesn't. I also thought I might like the rest of the CD. I didn't. Nirvana wanna be's but nowhere near as good, and all the rifts sound the same. I did like a couple of the slower, quieter songs. But as a whole, a waste of $13.49."
3,Great Grohl,"3 1/2Aside from a few clunkers, this is surprisingly staying, sometimes slaying power-rock, producing a balanced male and female energy to aid some of the best hooks the Foo's have grooved, and arguably their only vital work."
4,"Good Album, but would be better with W. Goldsmith on drums","This album was good, but Dave's drumming can't compare to William Goldsmith's. It is unfortunate that he left the band."
5,I can't believe how good this CD is,"From the slow rock of ""Doll"" and ""February Stars"" to the unbelievably loud ""Monkey Wrench"" and ""Wind Up"" to the energized ""Everlong"" (as well as all the awesome guitar licks in between), this CD will blow you away. Stop reading and buy it, NOW."
5,What is there to say about this awesome album?,"I'll tell you what to say...awesome, maybe?! Wind up and Walking After You are the best tracks on this album, with My Hero and Everlong right behind them. Monkey Wrench could have been kicked off though."
5,This is the best cd I have ever bought,"If I could have just one cd with me on a desert island it would be The Colour and the Shape. The cd starts off slow with doll, and then hits you with Monkey Wrench, a fun loving song. Hey, Johnny Park! is a very well constructed song. My poor Brain and Wind Up shook me up. Up in arms slowed it down, but brought it right back up. My Hero is a powerful song with plenty of power. Everlong shows a mature and passionate side of the Foo Fighters. Walking After you is a nice slow song, and lulls you into thinking the cd is ending, but New way Home smacks you in the face and wakes you. All in all, The Colour and the Shape is a lively diversified record. It will never grow old."
3,A Different Direction For Me,"I'm probably quite different from the other people who've reviewed this album--most of whom seem to be Nirvana fans. I bought it because I heard ""Walking After You"" and thought it was haunting and beautiful. (No, not very profound--but still moving both lyrically and musically). Well, the song's not typical for the album--but still I was intrigued by the mixture of pop (very listenable melodies) and punk/alternative. In the end, a bit too much screaming for me, but that's my musical taste. This album just misses making me a fan--but not by much."
5,THE BEST CD I HAVE,"THE FOO FIGHTERS ""THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE"" IS THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. IT HAS THE COOLEST SONGS ON IT YOU GROW ATTACHED TO AFTER AWHILE, SUCH AS EVERLONG, AND MY HERO. THEY ARE MY FAVORITE BAND AS WELL, AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!"
4,One of the Top 20 or the 90's,"a great CD that features consummate production, great songwriting and generally just ROCKS! this is also one of the loudest (a shout out to Spinal Tap) CD's you'll ever put in your CD player. you engineers know what i'm talkin about. anyway, hats off to Grohl (sp?) and company. their latest is also worth checking out, although not as loud...""i like that Rock and Roll music but sometimes it hurts my ears."""
4,Foo Fighters are still tight!,I have loved these guys since their forming after the passing of Cobain. A great album I still enjoy listening to.
4,good but not foo fighters at their best,"this album is good but is no where near as good as the other two foo fighters albums. such songs as everlong, wind up and hey johny park are awesome but their is two many songs that lack the foo fighters edge."
4,"I'm scared, I'm 46 and I'm buying this CD for myself!!!","Originally was listening to this album for one song ""Walking After You"" and suddenly I am buying it... what does that tell ya?"
4,The albums good.....,"I like the album but, Dave Grohl will never be compared to Kurt Cobain nomatter what he does. I love the Foo Fighters dont get me wrong, its just that a friend and I where arguing about Kurt and Dave. I was in 12th grade when Nevermind came out. it seemed like the biggest thing since like The Beatles or something, If you want better Foo Fighters roots, get Nevermind(Nirvana)."
5,Looks Great,"Confession: I did not purchase this to play on a record player, because I don't have one. As a wall hanging, this looks great. The colors are rich and it is big enough to make an impact. Strongly recommend as apartment art!"
2,Just didn't live up...,"I bought this way back when the songs from this album got airplay. And sure, I thought for a LONG time before buying it (this was before I found places where I could listen to CDs) and, I decided to buy it because of the number of airplay singles.So...I thought it would be good. I thought that the same amount of heart would be put into other songs. Well...that wasn't the case. A lot of the songs seemed to be 'filler.' I have sold this album, so I can't give a song-by-song relay. I DO remember that ""Hey, Johnny Park"" was pretty good though. So, to anyone reading this, listen to the samples (i know they're only 30 seconds, that sucks) and try to find a place near you that lets you listen to CDs or borrow this first. I'm giving this 2 stars because the 'radio' singles were good."
4,It's about time...,"I'm so sick of books that you read just so you can feel intelligent and converse with other people who read the same book so they could feel intelligent and so on and so forth - WAKE UP PEOPLE! - with Poop With Flies, you can actually sit down, look at cartoons of poop with flies, and just let your mind go. There's no need to be embarrassed of poop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
4,Excellent,"I have been reading Christian fiction for 15 years, and have yet to find one as compelling and thrilling as this one. This book not only included suspense (the first time I have been actually INTO a book by the first page), but an interesting plot-though a bit unbelievable- it captured my interest and caused me to want to further research the culutre portrayed. For those who like a little romance-this definately has the perfect blend. There were few downfalls with book-the main one being the unlikeness of Erica enduring the prince's attitude problems...but otherwise...this book is incredible! I definately recommend it.It is obvious that the author has a wonderful talent that I am sure many will enjoy."
2,Where's the beef?,"IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE fans get a very short interview with Ray Bradbury, Bradbury's script and nothing else of interest. The rest is filler. Apparently NOT wanting to share the proceeds with Universal, there are only a few photos, horribly reproduced. For $125??! Bah."
2,"Random events strung together, with a really quick end.","I loved wind in your wheels, which is why i bought this book, but it seemed to be really hurridley written. The end stops quickly, with same abruptness you experience if you're the victim of a big pothole. Also, I appreciate the hassles that lone women travellers face, but as a man, the book made me feel that my section of the human race are irredeemable sex pests. Don't bother with it if you want a glow after reading."
4,Great chapstick for the price!,I originally got this chapstick to help my order qualify for free shipping. I was surprised at the good quality of the chapstick for such a low price. The chapstick moisturizes well and surprisingly has a decent taste.
1,Smells bad,The goats milk drew me and this may work really well but after the first application I felt like gagging. Didn't suit me.
3,Has a funky smell I can't get used to,"This feels pretty good on my lips, but there is a strange smell to it that I just don't like."
3,Not bad,"As far as lip balms go, this product is no better or worse than plain old Chapstick. I was expecting to be wowed but unfortunately this product isn't anything special."
3,"Love the smell, just didn't work that well for me","I wish I could have a whole house full of things that smell like this lip balm, but I see other reviewers are quite polarized about it. For me, the only downside is that it doesn't seem to moisturize my lips that well. But I have poor luck with all products listing Mentha oil or menthol as an ingredient, it is a skin irritant I believe."
2,It's okay,This item did not rub onto my lips easily and I would prefer and more smooth chap stick. Just personal preference really.
3,Basic balm. Creamy.,"Organic balm, hence the extra $$$. Don't know if it's worth it. Creamy, sometimes it breaks off. Not too happy about the formula. I really don't like ""white"" formulas. I prefer ""clear"" balms."
4,Nice and smooth,Nice texture and makes lips feel hydrated. If you like a minty lip balm than this is perfect. I would prefer it if it was unflavored or unscented.
1,Dried out my lips,"At first, I really liked this product, but after about two weeks of use, I started noticing my lips getting chapped and more dry than usual. There are some chapsticks that actually do the reverse of moisturizing your lips. This product completely dried out my lips as well as caused red blisters to form on the corners of my mouth. It's been a few weeks now since I stopped using the product and the corners of my mouth are still recovering from it. I've never had such an allergic reaction to any goat milk product, and I use goat milk serum and moisturizer al over my face from another company/ brand with no issues. I am not sure what is in this product that made my skin react this harshly but whatever it was, I have stopped using it and have returned to my original Chapstick brand which has not dried out my lips."
4,great stuff!!,"Have tried many lip balms and so far this is the best one...great stuff, not greasy, feels good for a long time and you don't have to re-apply as much as with others."
5,"Hydrating, not as sticky as ohters","It smell a little like goat I think (just kidding). Great product if you grade it on performance alone. Mint flavored with some un-identified herbal after-taste. Rolls on thin but penetrate deep into dry lips. It stays long time but not sticky. I'd get it again for myself and will give it as gifts, too."
1,Makes Your Lips Worse,I have used this for about a month now and have decided that this may be the worst chapstick I have ever used. It chaps your lips worse and you have to use it every half hour just to keep them from chapping again. Go for a different chapstick.
1,Not Good,Dried out my lips. Horrible fake spearmint flavor. I hated it. My daughter hated it. Will stick to Burt's in future. Burt's is the best out there. Period.
1,Irritating,This product actually dried out my lips and made the skin in the corners of my mouth crack.This product is not for everyone.
2,Disappointing.,"I have very dry lips, and have tried a variety of lip balms over the years, ranging from low-end (Chapstick, Vaseline, Neutrogena etc) to higher-end (Jack Black, Kiehl's, etc). I decided to try this Canus organic lip balm out, but I didn't care for it. Its performance didn't help nearly as much as other brands on my lips. I also thought the odor was a little strong, and the balm itself was too soft (so I would get small pieces of it on my lip after applying). Despite the low price, I won't be purchasing this again."
2,Elementary,"I didn't like the author's approach. I felt as if I were reading a book meant from my 6th grader. I was very offended by the repetitive statements; if I didn't get it the first time it was stated three more times. Duh! For the newcomer to DiSC or temperments, this book would be a find. But for someone wanting to deepen their knowledge, it was a waste. Too elementary. I would recommend ""Different Children, Different Needs"" (this author contributed) or ""Understanding How Others Misunderstand You."""
5,Modern Love Story,The book Allegiance is well written with likeable characters and real life situations. The love story does not just end with the marriage but starts the beginning of a stronger love. The author incorporates a modern situation that tears at the heart strings and makes the reader wonder about being in the same circumstance. This is a feel good book that leaves you with a smile.
1,Don't waste your money !!!!!,"If you want to learn anything about Beatles records, you are much better of getting copies of Bruce Spizers books,and tracking prices on Ebay. Forget about this overrated and out of date waste of money. I wish I found out before I blew a bunch of money on Ebay."
5,Great design,It is well thought out with interchangeable parts and pads. My ipod mini fits securely in the smaller optional sleeve. It came with a firecable ac plug for charging the unit. I havent run the battery down so no info on the battery life.
2,I had to skim to the end,I have read several other books by Katie Fforde and expected to enjoy this one. I should have left it on the shelf. It is dull and predictable and full of slightly annoying characters. Twas no fun at all...
3,A Tad Boring,"I have enjoyed several Katie Fforde's books, but I found this one boring and predictable and struggled to finish it. If this was the first Katie Fforde book, I would have not read another one by her. She has done much better - my favorites are Stately Pursuits and The Roses Revived."
3,Fun even if it doesn't make much sense,"I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to trying some of Fforde's others.This is basically a very light-hearted romance, with plenty of eccentric characters who become somewhat endearing once one knows them. The best part of the book is really the plot about trying to save a mill that has been mismanaged. The weakness is that the development of the romantic suspense does not fit in with what we know of the characters involved. We are told about their childhoods, etc. but there is no real effort to tie those factors into the story. Then one wonders why they are put in there. The heroine resists the pull of our romantic lead for reasons which make little sense overall.Fortunately the tone of the book is so light and frothy that the illogical bits almost seem irrelevant"
4,Another terifically determined Fforde heroine!,"I really enjoy Fforde's books, primarily because her heroines are strong, determined, and a little cranky sometimes. Even though Fforde's novels are light and fluffy for the most part, you can always count on Fforde to present a great protagonist.Katie Fforde is a great author to read when you don't want depressing, when you don't want to think too hard, when you need a smile.The only thing I didn't care for about Highland Fling was the sometimes in-depth information into the textile aspect of it; however, I understand there was a place for it and that those details were appropriate; they just bored me a little.I will continue to read Fforde's offerings with pleasure."
1,She's done so much better,"Katie Fforde's work is generally so much better than this annoying effort. The heroine's choices make NO sense, her motivations are childish in the extreme, and the whole book seems sloppy. Fforde's editor needs to work a little harder."
3,"Beautiful, but too small","I ordered these earrings for my Mom for Christmas... she actually picked them out & had seen the size indicated online & thought they'd be ok, but after she received them we realized they're actually quite small!! So just factor in to purchasing them that these are pretty teeny earrings. Other than that, they're nice - just to small for what my Mom was hoping for."
5,Captives,"Captives is a very enjoyable film. Tim Roth is superb and showed a full range of emotions during the movie from very quiet and emotional to violent when necessary. The relationship between Tim and Julie was thought provoking. As always, you must watch Tim Roth's face - it says so much more than just words. The other main characters were also very good."
4,good flick,"I just saw this movie the other day and waspleasantly surprised. Julia Ormond was fabulous.Her face conveys so much emotion, it's amazing.She made the movie. Overall a very watchable flick."
3,BLAND,"Despite your love of Tim Roth avoid this borefest. It's predictable, characters running in and out acting strange without explanation. Anyone could have done Roth's job, he brought nothing to the table. As a result the film falls flat on it's face."
2,Captives,"I have seen Julia Ormond in some good movies and she is a great actress. This is not one of them. Senseless subject. The audio is bad, or the language is not what I am used with, so I understood only half of what they said in the movie. Stay away from this one!"
3,"Pleasantly Surprised by Tim Roth in a ""Romantic"" Role","I totally disagreed with a review of this movie in which it was suggested that Tim Roth was not suited for this role. While I already knew that he is a brilliant actor, I was swept away by the chameleonic, sensual quality he displayed in Captives. Roth, like John Malkovich in Dangerous Liaisons, has proven that you don't have to look like Brad Pitt to be the romantic leading man.The ending was a bit rushed for me; however, Roth and Ormond are very successful in their attempts to portray the tortured characters in this strange and slightly twisted love story."
3,honest review,"I was very excited to try this program, but was soon disappointed.The program for making a slide show is very easy to use.My main complaint is the the quality of photos is less than I would like it to be. I have used other programs to create slide shows, with much better results. I wish I could find a program that is easy to use like VideoShow, and still have great quality in the end product.What I like best about the ease of use, is that when you add music to your photos, the program automatically time shifts the photos to adapt to the exact length of the photos.Until I find a better program, I will stick with PhotoStory3."
3,magnifying lens,I like the magnifying lens; however the diopter glass lens does not attach to the lamp as it shows on the description and on the box.
1,IT FELL APART AFTER ONLY TWO BOTTLES!!!!!,"This corkscrew worked very well. And it was well taken care of. It wasn't dropped or thrown around.But after opening only two bottles of wine, the corkscrew portion itself, the part that moves up and down stopped doing that. It will now only push a cork into a bottle. I almost did that before I realized that it wasn't going to work anymore.It just stopped turning the corkscrew.The idea is a good one but apparently you either have to spend more, or get a different brand.I may have gotten a dud, but, I remember thinking that the construction seemed a little loosey-goosey when I received it, but who knew."
5,Works as Advertised,"I love it, especially since I got it at a special price. Full Retail is extreme."
2,not impressed with all parts,"I opened three bottles of wine with the Houdini and after the second bottle I noticed that one of the rubber pieces that holds the bottle in place had torn. Maybe I happened to get a lemon, but I don't think that something well made should tear after a few uses."
1,this thing stinks,"After 6 bottles and 3 people trying we still can't get this gadget to perform. Frankly I am amazed that anyone would review this positively, the directions are horrible and we resorted to our old 25 cent cork screw which opened fine. I bought this as a gift for my husband and it is going in the trashbad bad bad"
2,Troubles,I had purchased a Rabbit earlier for $$$. It worked fine for just over a month and now it will not engage to extract the cork. I will have to send it back to New York for replacement. Unneeded expense and inconvenience. The Rabbit is a step up from the Houdini! What can we expect form this lesser model?
3,buy the rabbit instead,"Man...I thought our Houdini corkscrew was cool, until I saw my friend's Metrokane Rabbit corkscrew. The Rabbit is much more sturdy and well worth the extra couple dollars.The joints on the Houdini start getting a bit wiggly after a few uses, which really impedes on the usability of the product. My friend's Rabbit doesn't seem to have that problem.If you're looking for a spiffy contraption, yet only open about 5-10 bottles of wine in a year, than the Houdini should do you just fine. If you plan to use this on a regular basis, then splurge and upgrade to the Rabbit."
3,"For the cost, good, but otherwise...","For the same cost of traditional / ""ah-so"" prong type openers, this screwpull knockoff is a good buy (but must consider the bulky size tradeoff). However, when compared to the expensive versions it is a sorry substitute. I have used a LeCreuset Screwpull daily for the last year or two and it has been basically no-brainer flawless even with challenging corks. The Houdini requires one to manually confirm the point is going in centered and one must play with the grip to ensure the point ""catches"" in the cork. In the first week, I have ripped one cork and plunged another -- mistakes that the expensive models make nearly impossible. The unit is stylish and looks a lot more expensive than what it is going for, but the adage you get what you pay for still holds. If you open a lot of bottles pay the bucks and eliminate frustration. If you are debating between a ""waiter's"" corkscrew and this for the same price, and you don't mind the bulk, then this will suffice."
3,Bulky Contraption,"It opens wine bottles well enough, but then so has every other wine opener that I have ever owned. This one looks cool doing it, though. It requires some force to throw that lever over, so I wouldn't recommend it for the frail. It puts a bit of torque on the bottom of the bottle, causing me to worry that it is going to slip and take out some glassware. It doesn't work well with plastic corks. The foil cutter is of poor quality. It takes up a lot of room in a drawer."
2,Okay for a while...,"This worked really well when I first got it, but it seems as though it gets harder and harder to use as time goes by, almost as if it's wearing out. And it's not when you insert the corkscrew into the wine, it's when you try to pull the cork out - it's almost impossible now. So, bottom line is - it will work for maybe a year or two but then you'll need another, which to me isn't acceptable for the price I paid."
4,Reader from New York,"An excellent help to church leaders, pastors and pastoral search committees. A must reading for all in these situations.Anyone that is concerned about their church and the difficulties of a Firestorm should read and heed what the author has to say. His insight is filled with Holy Spirit boldness."
4,Good for working out when weather does not permit,"I normally work out by going on power walks with trekking poles or riding my mountain bike. But sometimes the weather is not permitting when I have free time: for example, in summer, on my middle of the day break from work, it's way too hot to be outside.It would be a better product with a way to vary the resistence. I believe gazelle makes a model that is more expensive that does have resistence."
2,Good Luck Finding Replacement Parts!,"My wife & I bought one of these & it wasn't too long before the bushing went bad in the upper control arm. I tried to call the company to order a new bushing, & it seems that they went out of business in November 2012. Looks like they are just trying to get rid of their extra surplus. Don't waist your money!"
3,Good Price but not an overall great workout.,"So now that I've been using my Gazelle for about a year, I'll update my original review. It's a great price, and honestly as long as you're moving it's better than sitting on the couch but I really don't get much out of it. It takes me about 20-25 minutes to get my heart rate up at all and by that time I'm pretty bored with it. It does fold nicely and it is very easy to move."
5,Economical & Convenient,"I love this machine! I've lost 15 pounds in a month combining 45 minutes of this machine and a good diet. I started using this a month after I had my third child and it was super easy. There are different ways of using this machine to really feel the burn in your legs, but if you use it the way you see on TV you will have a lot of cardio with little to no burn. I read a review about a motion sickness possibility and I can say that I get extremely sick in the car, boat, etc and I haven't felt motion sick at all while using this machine. It has a great calorie counter, timer, distance calculator, etc. I start watching a show and exercise and the time goes by in no time. I definitely recommend this product!"
5,Better than expected,I was surprised at how great this machine is. The first time I got on it was harder than I thought; but the thing I found out was that when my legs started to get tired I could use my arms to take up the slack a bit and vica versa. I burned 500 plus calories in 20 minutes! In the neutral position the Gazelle seems to gently make you keep up a steady pace. When you lean forward (and back) you use a different set of muscles in each position. And I work up a sweat each time I use this thing. I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to any one wanting a quality machine without spending a fortune!
4,I love this machine~,I ordered this off of amazon.com The shipping was prompt and this machine is fantastic! I bought this machine in lieu of a treadmill and I am glad I did! It is a good sound economical buy! I enjoy my workout and this machine was easy to put together and SO easy use! I definitely recommend it!
1,The Manufacturer is out of business,"If you buy this machine, you are on your own without a warranty because the manufacturer, Fitness Quest is OUT OF BUSINESS."
3,Mediocre workout,"I have been using the Gazelle Edge for a little over a month now and I am not that impressed with it. I don't break a sweat when using this machine, even after an hour. I think it is the same as walking down the street to get exercise...you don't exert yourself too much but it still keeps you active and burns a few calories. But by no means is this for someone wanting to get in shape or lose some serious weight. This machine is not for you if that is what you are looking for. I am content with using it while I watch TV. Its better than just sitting on the couch. So basically it is only a three star piece of equipment. If you are looking for something to give you a great, 1000 calorie burning workout then keep looking for something else."
4,Gazelle Edge Feedback,"I bought this off of Cragislist and it has kicked my butt. I really researched it prior to buying and noticed a person either hated it or loved it.Let me tell you, if you are doing it right...you WILL feel it. Especially in the whole thigh area. When I first started doing it, I wasn't getting much of a workout. I adjusted myself after 4 minutes my thigh muscles were straining so hard I had to stop.If you can buy it used, that is the best deal. I paid $50.I will write more feedback after I have had it a month."
2,Absolutely no Resistance!!!,"Okay, Im actually one of the people who read the reviews before purchasing. Although there were neg, there were more positive so I went on and bought it. however, I wish I could get my money back. This thing makes you feel like you are gliding on air. I didnt even sweat until like 20 minutes in and it was only a couple of beads of sweating? UGH, I am like a moderate workout person and since having a baby 10 weeks ago, I needed something to help shed the pounds, but this is not the machine for me. I ended getting a membership at the gym for only 20 bucks a month were their are real ellipticals and Im sweating in no time and doing 45 minutes. I now have my edge trainer listed on Craiglist for sale!!!!! There is absolutely no resistance on this thing!!!"
1,not good,"i have had this thing for under a month now and the display thing that tells your time, calories burned, distance is already broke, Ive done nothing harmful to break it, and im sure as hell not going to take it back apart to send it back for a new one, i tried changing to batteries and that didnt work, overall i wish i wouldnt have bought it, and went for a stationary bike instead."
3,Did the trick.,"Very cheap. I bought this b/c I wanted to get in shape but didn't know if I would so I went the cheap route. It did the trick for me. I had it one year, that's all it lasted. It squeaks after time, a short time. The calories burned are off and the distance is off. I ripped that off so I wouldn't concentrate on that."
1,Flawed Product,"Once assembled, the Gazelle does not sit flat on the floor. The back bar is not straight and I have to put a pile of papers under one corner to make it not rock from side to side. No way of knowing until assembled. Too much of a problem to send back."
1,Hurts the knees if you keep at it,"I have used this machine for a few months, initially it was only the feet that hurt, but as time went by, I feel the pain in my knees, they feel sore, simple physics, the elliptical makes u actually move your knees, with the gazelle, your knees are straight while just swinging your legs with pressure on your knees to accommodate the contraction and expansion of the swings.....messing up the cartilage of the knees. I would give this machine a no star....it HURTS your knees. Don't buy this piece of junk, $120 in the drain."
4,My kind of exercise,"I want an easy, enjoyable piece of exercise equipment. I have tried many kinds--elliptical, vibration platform, recumbent bicycle, etc. Without a doubt, this is the most fun and the easiest type of exercise I have ever done. That being said, it is probably the least effective as far as challenging your muscles (and therefore, only 4 stars). However, I look forward to my daily exercise as opposed to dreading it. I have had knee problems, and this seemes to be very easy on the knees, even noticeably helping me walk better. I'm happy. If the best exercise is the one that you do, this is the best!"
5,my gazelle,The Gazelle Edge was easy to put together. I did it by myself. I have been using it for three going on four weeks now and I love it!! I come home from work and put on my exercise outfit and put the Gazelle Edge in front of the TV and use it while I am watching Divine Design.
3,Squeak?!?!?!,"This work really good. I get on it everyday while watching Tv. Its a low impact work out so I can go a really long time on it and not get too tired, but when I am done I know it's worked me out cause the can feel the twitches in the back of my thigh. This would be a five except that it has an awful squeak when on it, and even spraying it with wd-40 hasn't work to stop it. The timer on this broke on the second day, which isn't a huge problem for me cause i dont count calories, and I got for on it for a tv show or two not an exact time limit, but for some it would be a real issue."
2,Kind of Goofy,"Using this machine feels like trying to run with a swing under each foot. Your legs will fly back and forth randomly and it feels awkward. It doesn't really feel like you're getting a good workout. Assembly was easy enough, but the machine was kind of flimsy. I would not recommend this product."
5,Just what I'd hoped for,This is a great machine for the price. My wife loves it. It got to us fairly quick and was easy to put together. I would recommend this to anyone.
3,So Far So Good,"This is the second day I have used this product, Im on a flex pay with Seventh Avenue, wish I knew how cheap it was on Amazon :(Anywho, I feel very sore from using it. Idk why people are saying they didnt work up a sweat because I definatly did. I love it! The only thing I really hate about it is how my feet burn after a few mins. So I have to take breaks. And I doubt im really burning that many calories in a 30 min workout, cmon lol. But I love this product. Like people have said, you can watch tv while using it, its not boring at all to use. You just have to really use your arms and you will feel the burn. I also glid just my legs only without using the handle bars and I feel the burn on those too. Right now my entire body is sore.To be honest, it was a bitch to put together. But Im a chick and I dont put stuff together much unless its like a toy for my son. I spent a long time cussing, but I just didnt understand the instructions lol."
5,gazelle edge,I bought this to start exercising and its been great. I just use it for thirty minutes a day and I feel so energetic and happy with it. Great product for anybody who wants to feel energetic and wants to be healthy.
4,Gazelle Edge,Took a while to assemble. Probably would have been easier with 2 people. Product is exactly as described. Wish it came with an instructional video for usage. Good equipment for the money.
1,Good for Beginners/Non-exercisers,"I borrowed this product from a family member and I am glad I didn't go out and buy one first. This machine would be acceptable for in between workouts of intense aerobic activity days. I worked out on it for 30 minutes (2.25 miles) and I didn't even break a sweat and my heart rate didn't even increase. I thought it was a glorified treadmill, because it's very easy on the joints. I did have a problem with my toes feeling a little numb after 20 minutes and I needed to adjust my feet every so often to make sure they were in the middle. I was a little disappointed I am used to getting a good aerobic workout (i.e, step aerobics, elliptical, etc)."
3,Works Muscles!,"Although this machine does not give a good cardio work out, it does work lots of muscles. When I use my Gazelle Edge I feel the burn in my legs and abs. If you use the machine at least 4 days a week, eat right, and add in 30 of a full body work out routine, you will see results! I lost 4 lbs and 2 inches in the waist after 2.5 weeks. It is true that you get what you pay for, but if you put in a little extra work on your own, you'll see the results that you want."
3,A decent product!,"I bought this product 2 weeks back from a local store! After using it heavily, I feel this product can do a lot better than what we expect it to do. Don't have very big expectations on this product. Lot of people talked about inaccurate calorie burnt counting, but the product I received counts calories burnt realistically (14 calories per min is not unrealistic). I guess they fixed that problem in new versions. But when I work out on it for like 15-20 mins, it starts squeaking loudly, and in spite of wearing shoes and working out on it, many a time my leg slips and I have a lot of uncomfortable and jerky movements while working out on it. For its price, its a good product but over expectations will make you dislike it. Its good for a 10 minute low to moderate intense workout session (you can divide up your total workout for the day into 10 min sessions). But working out for like 20-30 mins on it will surely make you feel uneasy and uncomfortable."
2,bad product,"its making noise after using it for a week.The display went off as the battery was drained with display on even when not using the machine the previous machine i was using didnot have these problems,Also the price went up."
4,gazelle is fun,"I bought this gazelle due to having had one years ago. It's as fun as I remember. Time goes by quickly. The calorie counter is not accurate though, but the others (time, distance, speed) seem to be ok. After several uses, the machine gets a little noisy, so will need WD40. Fairly easy to put together too. I would recommend this."
5,Mr. & Mrs. Bob Muir 2-3-10,"We are age 60, & 62. It is easy to use. We like it. You can do five minutes, or thirty minutes, more if you want. Turn on the t.v. or some tunes, you hardly know you're excercizing yet you're burning calories & strengthening muscle."
5,Good Exercise Machine,"Amazon once again was good to work with and the machine arrived as stated.The shipping box took a real beating but the product was packed very good and was not damaged.As a senior, I wanted a machine I would use and not stress my joints. I got to say, this is a great machine. I am very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it.The product must be assembled when it arrives, and if you have two people working on in, it is easier. It took me about an hour and I am not a mechanical inclined person.The only problem noted with the machine was a ""squeek"" after about an hour usage. I WD-40ed the ""axel bar"" and it is fine now. The bar comes pre-greased, but maybe needs a bit more grease.I am very satisfied with this product. It is the best exercise machine I've ever owned ... light weight, durable, easy to store, and provides a good workout."
4,Love2Run,"I purchased the Gazelle and received it a few days ago. I tried it out last night and WOW! I was simply floored and amazed by how sturdy this machine is. It really gives you a quality workout, unlike some of those other expensive machines. I LOVE IT!"
2,"Great for losing wieght, horrible noise after 1 month","I am giving this machine 2 stars because although it works -- I lost 10 pounds in a month by using it 3-4 times a week for 15-30 mins -- after 1 month of usage, the machine makes horrible noise. It is so loud, you cannot bear it, and if you turn the TV on to silence it, you can't even hear the TV! I used to use it late at night but now I can't because it wakes up my kids. I wish the part responsible for this was of better quality so that I could enjoy my machine much longer."
3,So far so good,I just bought this a couple weeks ago and so far I really enjoy it. Its very quiet and I am able to get a decent workout from it. It was fairly simple to put together and I was able to buy it at Walmart for $85. We'll see how I like it in a few months. Its folds easily and I store it against the wall in my living room for motivation.
3,good for the price,"I definitely get a pretty decent workout, but I'll definitely be upgrading to something better down the line. I like that you can create your own resistance and can work both your arms and legs at once and with low impact, and it is a pretty natural feeling motion, unlike some ellipticals. However... it doesn't feel totally stable. A bit wobbly. I would like to upgrade to something with built in resisitance training once my skills advance, it's definitely just for beginners."
5,Trying To Slim Down This Will Get You There!!!!,the gazelle is the best excercise machine. My wife uses it in conjunction with her treadmill and loves it. Not only can she see and fell results but i see them too. Every week she gets slimmer and more tone. There are so many variations of excersises to do on this thing. It is a fantastic tool for weight loss or just getting in shape. I would reccomend to 10 out of 10 people.
3,It's OK,"This machine is just okay. I bought it because it was cheap and light, and easy to use. The computer kapoot after about 2 weeks, so what's the point. They could knock $20 more off the price & sell it without a computer. It is easy to use, and very stable considering how light it is! It's a fun machine, I just don't feel like I'm getting a very good workout since there's no resistance. For the price, which was around $75 at Christmas, it's a good product. If you're looking for an elliptical, this isn't what you want."
4,Great for people who hate to exercise!,"This is a great machine for people like me who hate working out, but want to start getting back in shape. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who jogs every day, but for anyone who doesn't normally exercise and wants something low impact to start with - this is perfect. I love the gazelle because it's totally quiet, so it's ideal for anyone who lives in an apartment complex. The calorie counter doesn't seem to work, but for the price I think this is a great value. Best of all it's fun to do!"
4,Nice compact exersizer!,"Actually I really can't remember how fast the shipping was, but there was minimal, if any assembly needed. It folds up fairly easy for storage. I just about use this everyday. It is a total body workout, and because of a medication I was on, I have very weak hip muscles. I have found if you stand sideways on the gazelle and move your legs from side to side, it exercises your hips and thighs. The higher you hold the handles during your workout, the more your workout your biceps. It's awesome because you can work out right in front of the tv or play music or whatever. If you turn the opposite direction on it, you can sprint and only work your legs. The one downside is that it takes a vigorous and intense workout on this (probably 30+ minutes) to really work up a good sweat."
5,I'm a happy camper,I had recently lost my original Gazelle in the move to Texas from New York and was so unhappy because the price of a bran new full size one has gone up a lot in the ten years I've owned mine. I was so glad to see that the smaller Gazelle Edge was more in the price range and here at Amazon it was cheaper still plus free shipping days. Thank you for that. This small machine is the best thing for those of us who have back injuries and can't walk far or use a treadmill. This is the perfect workout for anyone. It does it all with ease.
3,Good for maintenance,"I feel ok about my purchase - at least it wasn't overly expensive. I am an overweight person - looking to lose about 50 lbs. I started using the Edge everyday for at least 30-45 minutes. My biggest issues with the machine are that my feet go numb after about 20 minutes. Also, even with pushing myself to go at a good clip - I'm not really getting enough of a cardio workout to burn the fat I need. I have a feeling once I lose more weight, it will be good in maintaining...."
2,Spacers,"*squeeeeeak*.....*squeeeeeeeak*.......*squeeeeeeak*. And that's within one month of owning it!!! Not a very sturdy product. The movement is fine, although it takes some getting used to. If there's a sturdier [and probably more expensive] version, it might be worth checking out."
1,Robot nuts can't be removed,"I am so anxiety to get this together and start using it. BUT I CAN'T REMOVE THE NUTS.I have even bought a nut remover to put on my electric drill to try to remove them.I am so aggravated, guess I will need to wait for a male friend to come around to try."
4,Gazelle this!,"Setting up was fairly easy and the documentation that is sent with it is awesome!It has a guide on how to eat right (which I have not used yet) and also a guide on stretches and warm-ups, which I found extremely helpful.It does need some getting used to when you start out, though.The display on the machine seems like it's a little bit too generous though (there's no way I burned 600 calories in 15 minutes!!)All in all, you get what you pay for. For the price, it's not a bad machine to warm up your whole body on."
5,very good,I'm very pleased with this product. Better construction than I had hoped for. It's easy to use and I would definitely buy it again.
3,"Nice little machine, conveniently folds away","Item arrived neatly packaged. The outside box took a beating. I also hope the poor mail person didn't have to carry this by himself. As for the machine itself, it was easy to set up. I had an issue with one of the arms not fitting into the slot because there was a large bubble inside the tube where someone must have slipped up in the welding process. I had to hammer the arm several times for it to finally fit in there. The machine also is squeaky after only a few days of using it.Overall I am happy with the purchase. I rate it 3.5 stars out of 5 because of the squeaking and the problem with the arm."
5,EDGING SUCCESS,I FINALLY GOT TO PUT MY GAZELLE EDGE TOGETHER WHICH IS A HUMUNGUOUS FEAT FOR ME.I AM SO PROUD OF MYSELF..BUT I NOW USE THE GAZELLE AND I LOVE IT. I LOOK FORWARD TO MY NEW PRIVATE TIME WITH MY SPECIAL FRIEND. I AM FEELING HEALTHIER ALREADY. I CAN ONLY USE CERTAIN FITNESS EQUIPMENT SINCE MY KNEE OPERATION AND THE GAZELLE IS ONE OF THEM. ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I HAVE MADE IN YEARS. THANKS.
4,Gazelle Edge,"I like the Gazelle alot, I wanted something where I could watch tv while I workout. I cant seem to dedicate myself to work out videos and thought I would try this. I can do it for 45-60min while watching a show that is interesting. It keeps me working out longer. Its easy and I can fold it right up when I'm done so it does not take up much space. I also like it because its for your whole body. I haven't had it long but I like it!"
3,Enjoyable,"I'm a teenager looking for something to get me off my rear. I can't do the whole ""running"" exercise because my knees aren't good for that. THIS however feels amazing all over. I just received it last night but I'm returning it for an exchange because it arrived with the clips broken on the computer timer device (it's plastic, go figure nothing fancy). I would definitely recommend this for beginners and anyone looking for a simple way to start losing weight that they can actually stick to. With this gazelle, working out doesn't seem like working out, it's a breeze and comes with a little diet booklet that reminds you how to be safe. However, you WILL feel that you've been exercising once you step off, but that's a positive because the endorphins are totally worth it. I'm only giving it three stars because I was upset with the defective plastic time with broken clips that I received. Hope to get my new one in the mail soon and I'll use it every day!"
4,Diabetics take note!,"I've had a Gazelle for nearly ten years. I've pretty much worn it out. I'm thinking about purchasing a new unit or perhaps upgrading to the more expensive model. I have diabetic neuropathy which particularly affects my feet and hands. I achieve a great workout without impact so my feet withstand the exercise very well. It's also not as tough on the knees as an eliptical can be. Pound for pound, on the days I don't care to traverse to the gym, it's a great piece of equipment."
4,Not bad for the price,"Bought this as a way to ease back into exercising. I think it is good for a beginner but you really have to work at it to work up a sweat. It's a good piece of equipment to get the heart pumping though. After a few days of using it, it started to make a squeaking noise but a few drops of 3-in-1 oil took care of it. The next week, a squeak from another spot. Keep the 3-in-1 oil handy!"
3,Gazelle Edge,This item is not the easiest to assemble. It takes two people to get it done. I believe it is worth the price but it could get very boring if there was no TV or music available. It does set up in a small space and seems to be relatively sturdy.
5,Lost 8 lb,"Used it for 2 months,5 days a week, 45 min, and lost 8 lbs!! With no diet at all.... didn't even sweat cause I don't like to sweat. But if you do it faster like the videos you do sweat. But anyhow I still lost some pounds..."
5,Awesome,"I'm not sure why people are saying this product doesn't offer much of work out because it does. Basically you get what you put into it. I love that it takes up very little room and folds up nicely. Better yet, when it's too cold and rainy outside, I can use this machine for a run that's just as good as the real thing. Very happy."
4,Decent workout for very little money,"My family had gym memberships until I became unemployed. This little machine is less than half the cost of one monthly payment to our old gym and gets our heart rates up and gives us all a good cardio workout. It is definitely NOT an elliptical machine, but it does the job at a fraction of the price."
4,I love it!!!!!,"I totally love this product! For the price, you just can't go wrong. My reason in purchasing the Gazelle was that it was getting increasingly difficult to get to the gym with a 6 year old, homework, and all her extra curricular activities. Also, treadmill and road running was becoming very hard on my knee and ankle joints. I needed somthing small and compact, but reliable. Now, I can get on it in front of the TV and just go to town. Before you know it, an hour has passed by and I am sweating. I can tell that I am getting a good workout. The next morning, I can feel the soreness my leg muscles. Assembling was quick and simple(with 2 people). The ONLY complaint is that the calorie counter is completely off. But you can estimate your calories burned by going to caloriesburned.com and type in the type of exercise and duration."
4,works well when i use it,"it works well, when i use it.purchased after my mom used hers to lose 65 lbs with nutrition and weights.a little mixing it up helps [holding handle bars vs holding the base bar; long strides vs quick strides]but it does what i need it to do indoors when it's cold or i'm just not feeling like leaving my house.dries clothing very well, too!"
5,Love this Machine,I love this machine. I get on it & go. It is soo easy to use. What a great workout you get. I would recommend this gazelle to anyone looking for a fun & rewarding workout.
3,Just ok,"I've had this for about a year and I have a few comments.Wear sneakers or it will hurt your feet.It is simple enough for my 6 year to do.It is not very resistant, if you want a hard workout where you'll be sweating afterwards this is not the machine for you.Make sure you dont kick your cat while doing it.Folds up easily but is pretty heavy, although I can move it myself.You will feel a slight ache in your muscles the next (atleast you know it is working) but not much, so if you are a beginner this is a great buy.The monitor on this is a joke, it will tell you how fast you are going, which doesn't seem to be very accurate, how far you have gone, the time you've been doing it, and how many calories you've burned (about 100 calories in 20 mins at a moderate pace).I couldn't afford a more expensive one, so I chose this one, I dont regret my decision, but would just say if you are looking for a REAL workout this is not the machine for you."
3,Gazelle,The gazelle was fairly easy to put together with the instructions and there were no problems. The item seems pretty sturdy.
4,Great value! Very easy!,"I just bought mine earlier this month. It arrived two days ago and tried it out yesterday for the first time. The only thing that seems off is the calorie counter. If only I did burn that many calories in 30 mins, I would be ready for summer in no time lol. There was no problem breaking a sweat as some people have mentioned. I am use to using the elliptical at the gym for about 60mins at the speed of 6.8, so I did not think I would sweat, but I did. My husband said he broke a sweat too, but only after, he started to put his all into it, same as I did.Each person has a different physical fitness base, and a different resting heart rate, along with hydration, these things can make the sweat factor different for each of us.I am curious to see if I can lose the weight as some of the other reviews claim, I hope to have as much lick as they did = )I will let you know in 3-4 month!Cheers!"
3,Not a real elliptical machine.,"This machine is not a true elliptical machine. It only allows you to do a half ellipse due to the swinging mechanism, so it'll feel weird the first couple of times you use it.I would recommend spending another $40 or so for a real elliptical machine so you get the full running motion.It is built well and there is minimal assembly required. For the price it's ok, but I would shell out an extra $40 to get a real elliptical machine."
3,"Good for burning calories, but not a real work out","The gazelle is a good little machine for burning some calories while watching TV (as opposed to just sitting on the couch) but it is no workout. There is no resistance and I don't work up a sweat while using it. It's a good price for what you get, but it is somewhat cheaply made. it squeaks and makes a lot of rackety noise. Overall I like it for what I paid for it."
3,ABBREVIATED LIFESPAN,"GAZELLE-EDGE IS A VERY GOOD ELLIPTICAL MACHINE; HOWEVER, BE PREPARED FOR THE MACHINE TO BECOME USELESS AFTER A FEW YEARS OF NORMAL USE [30-MIN/DAY~4-DAYS/WEEK]. THE PLASTIC TRACKING DEVICE DISINTEGRATES; THE SQUEAKING IS NEARLY UNBEARABLE AND LUBRICANTS ARE INEFFECTIVE [I WEIGH 160-LBS @ 5'8"" TALL]. IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO FIND NON-PLUG-IN-MACHINES [YEAH, THEY SURE DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT THE ... ahem ... HUGE POWER DRAIN PLUG IN MACHINES ARE INFAMOUS FOR]. THANKS, AND YOU HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS, TOO."
1,waste of money,i got this after i had my first baby. i used 5 to 7 days a week. i used it an hour each time and i also used the ab lounge 5 to 7 days a week for an hour each time with it. i did not lose any weight and did not have any result after 3 months using it. the only thing that work was going for a walk and doing yoga. the ab lounge and gazelle are both junk and a waste of money.
3,"Ok, not a real work out. Incorrect calories.","I've used this machine in the past and liked it for its compact storage, but I never worked out back then. I wanted to buy it to keep at home for when I didn't feel like going to the gym. I enjoy it and I get a little workout from it, but I think my calorie read-out is busted.So having been to a real gym and used real ellipticals, I can tell you that on THOSE hard-core machines, I burn about 20 calories per minute. According to the calorie counter on the Gazelle, I burn about 40. This is horribly incorrect and should not be followed by anyone. Instead, read the time spent on the machine and multiply it by 10.The resistance is so low on this machine I had to buy 2.5lb ankle weights to put on the lower poles. I'm considering buying more...."
1,"Squeaked for a year, then broke while I was using it.",Not very durable. I went through an entire can of WD-40 on this thing over the last year and it final broke on me this morning. You get what you pay for. Would not recommend this product.
3,Decent machine but it's not an elliptical,I bought this machine because I thought it would be like working out on an elliptical but it's not. Otherwise it's sturdy & great if you're not used to working out.
2,sucked!,i was so disappointed! the machine started to fall apart in less then 3 days. and after working out for an hour i didn't feel anything nor did i sweat.
2,Horrible instructions,"I ordered this machine after reading some reviews and doing independent research. The product got here quickly, but once I opened the packaging and attempted to put the machine together things started to become problematic. If the directions are followed exactly as they appear in the insert the machine will not come together as it is supposed to. However you will still get a decent workout hefting around the bulky pieces trying to get the machine to open properly, which becomes even more tricky as the factory lubricant smears all over the slick metal. It may be a decent work out once assembled properly, however after an hour and a half of attempting to assemble I decided to walk away."
3,Good low impact workout,"Great for someone just starting a fitness program. You can increase your heart rate by varying your speed and following the suggested exercises included in the product booklet. I have never used any exercise equipment for as long as I've used this one. (One draw back: after a bit of exercising, my feet feel as though they are going slightly numb, or ""going to sleep"". This is probably owing to poor circulation in my legs, but thought it was worth a mention)."
5,Love it,"It's different, the price is where most can acquire it. Lifetime use and helps with balance too. Tighten up connections every once in a while."
4,Gets you moving,"Great little workout machine for the price. Stows away nicely, too. Have had it for two years and use in constantly, especially in the winter months."
2,not worth it,"I have the Gazelle Edge two stars instead of one because it is at least decently made and reasonably sturdy once it is assembled. I bought this item because of the good reviews at Amazon. Unfortunately, it does not provide a good work out, and is only appropriate for people who have never exercised in their lives. It has a rather limited range of motion and is really nothing like an elliptical machine. Is it better than nothing? Of course it is, but not much."
4,Works well as designed,The gazelle is a good choice for the low impact trainer. The assemble is a bit tricky but once that is completed the machine is stable and a great value.
1,Inferior product,"I purchased this product almost a year ago. I have used it apx 20 times and it is now squeaking, has a broken piece and the calorie counter is broken. I would not purchase this product again. I failed to pay attention to the negative reviews that had similar experiences as mine. Please pay attention to all the reviews."
2,Youngsters....don't buy this!,"I bought this piece of junk about two months ago and now it has been placed in the garage. It does work out your calves but other than that you might break a drop of sweat, ONLY (that being my case). You really have no idea how fast I had to operate this machine so that i could feel that i was actually having a good workout. I think this machine is ok for older people who have knee problems and stuff like that, or for people who have never exercised in their life, but if you're trying to lose weight(after changing your eating habits...the gazelle does not complement your effort) and break a sweat consider spending more money. In addition, after 10 min my feet felt numb. After all, it was only 100 dollars, but i learned my lesson and pretty much you get for what you pay."
4,My 1st exercise machine that I actually like to use,"I really like it, it does everything like Tony said.The only cons:-lots of parts to assemble-the ""computer"" is flaky and stopped working only after a few months-rattle and creaks after a few months"
2,Alright....,This product would be ok if you were seriously obese or injured....otherwise not enough resistence. I will use it when there is no other option of working out...Waste of $100....
2,The Gazelle Edge,"I purchased the Gazelle Edge for my husband approx. 2 years ago. He uses it daily. The problems we have had are:1. We can't seem to get rid of the loud squeeking even though we have oiled it with WD-40.2. The frame has cracked twice now in the handle bar area.We would like to replace it, however I would like to know if they have improved on the frame."
2,Do not waste your MONEY!,"I have to say that I have used several of these Gazelles, I purshaed one new and it lasted about a year before the rubber on the cables wore out and broke. I have bad knees so this low impact machine is good for that reason. But they have NO durability what so ever. I am on my 5th machine now, I do not buy new ones any longer because they are not worth the price. I can find all I want on Craiglist for $25 to $50.00. So that is what I do, when one breaks down I just find another used one."
1,You can get a better workout by sitting on the couch kicking your legs in the air.,"Imagine a weight machine with no weights or an exercise bike without a chain. Do you think you could get a good workout with such equipment? No, you can't. The reason is because there wouldn't be any resistance, you would just be going through the motions, your body wouldn't be pushing or pulling against anything. Well that is exactly how I would describe the Gazelle Edge.IT HAS NO RESISTANCE.I put my index fingers on the top of the handle bars and was able to easily get this going without any effort from my legs. That's how little resistance there is. It's like the manufacturer wanted to make operating this as easy as possible. It is totally worthless.If you are looking for a workout then save your money and get something, no......ANYTHING else."
1,Great if just your calves need work...,"I've had this machine since it first hit the market a few years ago. Everyone in my family has tried it with little result. I used it for 1 - 3 hours EVERY DAY for a few weeks. I have great calves. It works no other area, I didn't lose a single pound with the gazelle. I hardly break a sweat even given the lengnth of time that I spend on it. Add that's it's absolutely dangerous to have around young children and you'll can bet your money will be better spent to swallow your pride, join a good fitness center, and dedicate yourself to going. --- Jeannie"
1,Tennis elbow,"I owned this untill it fell apart. I am a larger person, 250lbs. The rating of this junk is about 200lbs. Be small to get small. I could use this for 45 min to an hours 4 to 5 times a week UNTIL my arms started going to sleep. Little did I know that this was the first symptom of repetative motion problems (tennis elbow). There are other MUCH better machines out there to use unless you are already a small light person. Notice that no LARGE people are demonstrating these machines........."
1,"Looks flimsy, is flimsy.",I worked at GNC and when this came out it was on display and yes I did get on and try it! It seems like your feet go all over the place almost as I can remember. It is not sturdy. And to be honest it just looks so.....small! I would want something that at least looked macho! And I'm a girl. (acct holders wife hehe)
1,"Stay far, far away","We bought a Gazelle 3 1/2 years ago. I wish I could turn back the clock and erase that purchase. I used it for 6 months with no results. I decided to double my workout on the Gazelle. I've had knee pain ever sinse. My patellas no longer track properly. I can no longer run, jump, or walk long distances. Buying the Gazelle was the worst decision I have ever made in my life."
1,no benefits,I am an active person and no matter how i used this model i could not drop a bead of sweat. Of course i do not own this model and tested at a relatives. It is not worth the cost no matter how cheap.
4,Almost perfect workout machine,"I love my Gazelle; I've had it for about 8 months now and still use it daily. It is perfect for when you are watching tv and it is great for people with poor joints. I get a great arm and leg workout everytime and it has helped me to lose 25 pounds. It is also fairly easy to store; mine stays in the closet when not in use. I have encounted two minor problems however. One, it requires a good bit of WD40 to keep it squeek-free. Sometimes it is quite annoying if I am watching something on the tv while working out. The second problem is that the plastic pieces on the backs of the foot boards have broken away. Luckily the absence of these pieces doesn't cause your feet to slip off. Overall though a great product and I would recommend it to anyone, both novice and seasoned exerciser."
3,"Easy ride, ok workout","It is smooth and I haven't noticed all the squeeks that others have heard. However, I will say that for me personally, I really have to work to workout on this thing. It has no resistance and unless you are really out of shape, try something else. My other complaint is the footing, my feet are constantly sliding on this and I often wonder if my feet are going to fall off the peddled stance area. I often have to stop and move my feet back into place. Overall I should have opted for an actual eliptical machine. But, if you are really out of shape and want a smooth, easy machine that is semi fun, get it. If not, look elsewhere."
4,Good cardio work out,I bought this item after reading reviews on the web. I am very happy with the Gazelle Edge because it allows me to get a good cardio work out session whenever I am in the mood for it. Excellent ratio price/quality.
4,Gazelle - A good Deal for the money!,"My Equipment is everything I thought it would be! I even was able to put it together by myself and I am not mechanically minded!The price was great. I have even caught my teenage daughter using it.I have not yet had time to figure out how to put the monitor on it - the one that tells calories burned, time exercised, etc.A good incentive for me to get out of the winter blues and back to exercising."
4,Good for me,"I like it that it was easy to set up. For me as an on again off again exerciser, it's a good piece of equipment to have when you're trying to work up a sweat and build some stamina. I believe my buns will benefit the most. I would say that before anyone buys exercise equipment, to definitely try to visit a sports store to try out equipment. This way one will have an idea of what they really need before going online to shop around. I do feel I got value for my money. Thanks."
4,Really Good,"I love that this Edge is so silent that you can be watching tv and not have the volume up all the way like you do with a treadmill. The one thing I did notice is that it's not as light as it looks which is great which means it can support somone,I've only have only ever had one problem and that's storage because of the hand rails but I make do with where it is."
5,Gazelle is all that!!!,I so loved this exercise machine in my church's weight room that I bought one for my house. It is totally quiet!!! It is a very usable addition to anyone's exercise program. Especially effective on the hips and outer thighs!
2,Not good for people already in shape,"I bought this product a few months ago and honestly I should have listened to some of the reviews. This does not give you a cardio workout if you are already in shape. It does however, work the leg muscles and keeps them toned. I needed for the winter and I will probally be getting rid of it.The quaulty is poor as well. The clock that keeps track of distance etc., never worked from day 1. It is also ver noisy now and it has only been about 3 months.This product is more for people who just need to get moving, not for those who consider themselves inshape. I don't think I have sweated once using it and I rev it up in attempt to make the workout worth it."
5,isitu,"I love it. Both my son and I use it. It's great for cardio, arms, legs and butt. Best of all no strain on the knee's. I told all my friends and family about it."
4,Great Buy,Great machine for the money. Got one for my husband and my mother. Both are very happy with this item.
1,It does NOTHING for you!,"To give you an example of the type of workout it gives you, my resting heart rate is 76, if I walk around the house during normal activity, my heart rate is 100. If I do the Gazelle for 30 minutes, my heart rate is 106. So I dont reach my target aerobic workout heart rate, I don't burn any fat, and I wasted my time and money. Cleaning the house works me out better than this. Why do you think none of the other reviewers break a sweat? If you want to get great aerobic workout, spend $5, buy a jumprope and do that for 30 mins., that'll get your heartrate moving, no kidding!"
5,Got good use out of it for 3 years.,"I got good use out of this product for three years before it finally bit the dust a few weeks ago. That's more than I can say you'll get with other machines that are priced this low. I work out regularly and beat this thing to you know what,and got a challenging workout doing so.. Even though I am not buying another one I'll recommend this product for anyone looking for something affordable that's not cheaply made."
2,Easy but not so great,"Owned a Tony Little Gazelle (same as the Edge) for several years. Had NO problem with the cables as others have mentioned (probably because I didn't use it all that much). The comments about feet sliding are all true. When I nestled my sneaker against the front edge the sneaker ""lip"" was slightly too high and hurt my toe, so I tried to move back. As a result of moving back my foot would slide all over the platform. When I worked out until I raised a sweat I found that my knees would ""lock"" and for days after I'd be in pain. So I was left unmotivated to use it, wasn't worth the pain...wound up giving it away in perfect condition. Bought a treadmill instead and am a happy camper."
2,Not the swinger I expected.,"I had one of the original Tony Little Gazelle's in early 2000. It was white, very sturdy and with incredible balance. This Gazelle Edge is no comparison. Very tinny and unstable with a limited motion range. Sent it back."
5,love it!,"I'm participating in a family biggest loser challenge here at home. Because I have a bad knee I needed something that would help me work out without hurting my knee. Looks like I'll be hitting my goal weight for June, that's when the competition ends. I can go at my own pace and still get a great workout. I love that I can put it in the closet when it's not in use. Did I mention that I have very limited space? I love my Gazelle! Oh! and I put it together myself!"
4,Gazelle Edge Is Great!,"Received my Gazelle Edge 3 days sooner than expected. It is light, easy to put together, and quiet. I was addicted to it as soon as I started exercising with it. It doesn't slide around, feels great, and is smooth through out its range of motion. I really don't like running, treadmills, ellipticals, or bikes, but I do like this. My wife loves it too. We are impressed of the build quality (China is always a hit or a miss on this). It is easy for anyone to pick up and move to the closet for storage."
1,Did not stand up to our chewer.,"I have an 8mos old border collie mix that is the strongest chewer I've ever owned. Thankfully he only chews on his toys! Unfortunately it makes if very hard for us to find things that can withstand his jaws. I was so hopeful with this one. He had the sides chewed off in 15 minutes. I'm not lying. The stuffing was ripped out before I knew it, and within this mass of white cloud was one of the squeakers - which they market as being triple wrapped in ""tuff"" material to keep it in the toy. He really did LOVE this toy though, I'll give them that - but it definitely did NOT hold up at all.If your dog is a big time chewer, don't get this toy - it just won't last. I've had the best luck with a sherpa dragon - that at least lasted about 5 days before I had to throw it out."
1,Lasted 5 Minutes,"Fenway, our 5 month yellow lab chewed this to pieces in under 5 minutes. She did love the toy but it is kind of expensive for only 5 minutes. She loves the Cuz toys, they squeak and made of rubber. Hope this helps."
2,Weak seams,"Our 6 month old pitt mix tore the black seams out in about 10 mins. So, probably will only last us a week. Good toy for a chaser, but not for a dog who likes to sit and pull apart."
1,Doesn't Live Up to Advertisement/Description,"I was really hoping this toy would last, because my dog loves soft toys, but my 1 year old Golden Retriever tore a hole in this within the first 24 hours. It does not withstand voracious chewing as the packaging would lead you to believe and was a waste of money."
3,Tuff enough to last 3 months,"Considering how much I paid for this bone, my 11 month old English bulldog , popeye and I are satisfied that this bone lasted 3 months but I wish it would've lasted longer. Normally, stuffed toys only last 30 minutes to 1 week in his possession, but I don't mind because I purchase them from big lots for under $5. Tuffy's are a bit expensive to me but I will definitely purchase another one soon."
5,Still going strong after several years use.,These tuffy toys are so strong that they are carried and tugged on by our 5 bulldogs. Really a good toy. very few toys hold up this well!
3,The only soft toy that lasted > 30 minutes,"I have bought this toy a few times for our pups. They like to play with soft toys, but most last only a few minutes before being destroyed. The stone bones usually last 1-2 weeks before they are too torn up to be safe. Our pups are 8 month old, 45 lb. lab/terrier mixes."
2,"Great for a 5 minute tearing frenzy, but that's it.","Maybe it would thwart a chihuahua or a ""teacup"" dog, but nothing bigger or even remotely stronger. It's a waste. I have a 75 lb. easy-chewing dog and a 40 lb. more agressive chewer, and we gave the Stone Bone to them as a ""gift"" on Xmas. We continued opening presents as they busied themselves with their toy, and when we glanced over about 5 minutes later, stuffing and shreds of fabric where everywhere. It was a total loss, and a total waste. I know they're decent chewers, but I've had cheap stuffed-animal toys that lasted longer. We were very disappointed."
2,Lasted 3 hours,"We have an American Staffordshire Terrier. She had tons of fun tearing this bone apart. I knew she would destroy anything we bought, but I thought it would last longer than it did. All the stuffing and squeakers were gone in 3 hours."
5,3 Years and Still Ticking!,"My husband bought me this watch over 3 years ago for my birthday, and I've worn it nearly everyday since. I love it. It's small, light, stylish, and I've never even changed the battery in it. And it's very durable. Take it from me, after 3 years, 2 dogs, multiple moves, and a tour in Iraq with the Army, this watch has withstood every beating I've sujected it to. I had a small problem within the first month I had it when the clasp broke, but I was told it was a manufacturers defect and it was covered by the warranty. I haven't had another problem with it since. Bottom line, it's a great watch, and if I ever lost mine, I would definately replace it with another one."
5,Reasonable price for a beautiful watch,This watch was all that was expected and more. It was reasonably priced from a well-respected manufacturer and was perfect for work or dress.
5,Perfect Mom's Gift,Bought it for mother's day. She liked it and it's a reasonable price. Would recommed this as a gift a elder women.
1,Beware! It's abridged!,"Box of delights and its prequel The midnight folks are truly great classics of children literature, but beware: the editions present on Amazon are an heavily abridged version edited by Patricia Crampton (it's an english tv-movie tie-in, if i'm not wrong).Check Amazon.co.uk for the complete version (published by Egmont)of these two wonderful, ageless classics."
4,Worthwhile Children's Literature,"As an adult I take a great deal of interest in and concern for exposing our children to excellent children's literature. While not well known this book is a wonderful one to be read aloud to a child with a good imagination or as a way of helping them to develop one. The character of Kay, a young boy, being cared for by a governess and household of servants helps youngsters from the ages of 7-10 to strech their imaginations and expand their vocabulary. The story is an engaging fantasy and fortifies the virutes of honesty, courage, and intelligence that we should all encourage. Much of today's children's literature may be action packed but is simplistic and lacking in character building ideas. The Box Of Delights is acutally the sequel to the Midnight Folk but can be read on its own. It won't bore the parent reading it either!Follow Kay on his Christmas adventure!"
1,Disappointing,"My 11 year old son really didn't like this book. He struggled to get through it as he says it was really boring. We kept encouraging him to finish it but it was putting him off reading anything so about half we through we gave up. The wording was old fashioned, not enough happened in the story and on the odd occasion when it promised to get more exciting, it did not follow through so he was very disappointed. He likes books full of action and adventure and this has none (so he tells me!)."
3,"Good CD, but get the U.S. release version!","The Japanese version actually has two bonus tracks, but they're both remixes of ""Street Lullaby.""In the 1st one, the ""2 Banks of 4 Remix"", the instrumental portion of the track is more prominent. You get a really full sound. I prefer this one to the regular album version.The other one is the experimental (?) ""Fourtet remix"". It sounds like they've chopped each individual lyric into pieces and looped the fragments randomly over a programmed drum beat, with some keyboard loops in the background.These bonus tracks are interesting as just that - bonuses. They're not worth paying the import price though, which is why I gave this excellent album only 3 stars."
4,Very Fresh...,"For those that like jazz, but are tired of experimenting and getting burned, this is your pick. I'm not familiar with the history and makings of this CD, but its funky, smooth, good variety, likeable, but not commercial....similair to a ""Kind of Blue"" meets acid jazz meets a touch Roni Size. About half or so of the tunes have vocals mostly female, one or two male. This is the kind of music you hear at a cool Bronx cafe, and wish you knew who was playing. Its got that ""Massive Attack"" laid back flavor with ""Morcheeba"" style."
5,There Must Be More to Love Than This/ Jerry Lee Lewis LP record,This Album finds Jerry Lee in top form with some great songs from his peak country period. It also has the # one country hit There Must Be More to love than This-over-all a very excellent Jerry Lee Lewis release.
5,Good Sata Cables,"I ordered these cables for cleaner cable management inside my ""HAF X"" case; I don't like having cables stick straight out, especially when its a tight fit. What's more to say for ""Sata"" cables, they work, they are durable, and there are no issues. I would recommend these to anyone who has a lot of hard drives or those who want things to look and be cleaner; the angle really helps a lot."
5,Meets expectations,I got this to make the long travel from a newly acquired Sata DVD CD writer. It meets expecations. Buy it.
3,"Connection works, but feels loose","Good long cable, connection is electrically solid, but mechanically feels a little loose. Overall the cable works well. No complaints."
5,Cables that transfer data do indeed transfer data,"I used 2 of these in a RAID setup I did for a client. They are secure, point ""down"" and are decently long. Would recommend and buy again."
1,"Horrible ""B"" Horror Movie","Poor acting, scenery, and a plodding plot! Not much to commend this movie apart from seeing early roles for some actors and end of career roles for others. The leading lady is attractive and the script demonstrates sufficient content for a decent horror film, but the movie misses the mark on too many levels to be considered good entertainment."
2,really Bad,I watched this movie because Boris Karloff is in it but it is a really bad movie. The scrip & the actors.
1,Rubbish,"I have tried both the DVD-R and the DVD+RDL blank discs purchased through the Amazon but neither works. Neither my DVR-MC1 Direct accept or recognise them nor my Pioneer player. Neither our HPMedia Center PC m7250n recognise the discs. So far they are a waste of money and completely useless. However, the TDK-DVD-R and Ridata DVD-R bought locally at Fredmeyer and locally made home videos on TDK or Memorex DVD-R or DVD +R work very well with all the machines I use."
2,Connectors are different from what Amazon shows,"Connectors shown on the Amazon picture are molded onto the cable. Picture also shows gold plated connectors.What actually comes in the package are crimped-on nickel-plated connectors of much lower quality than those on the picture and they don't look like they are ""wheaterproof"", definitely not water proof. I had to cut off the ends and get a set of compression connectors. S"
4,great product,very satisfied with this. very good quality. quick shipping. great place to buy this item. i researched alot before buying and this is the best deal and best product i noticed for the price.
1,Plug popped off on first move,I was moving my gear around and the cable pulled right out of the F-connector on the end. It was not tugged any harder than say 1/2lb of force or so.It was only 8 days old when this happened.Shotty.
4,RG6 Coxial Cable,"Purchased 75' RG6 coax cable on Amazon. It arrived in a timely manner, was good quality, and as advertized. I will probably duplicate this purchase when/if necessary"
2,False Advertising,"A friend just got me this cd from my wish list for Christmas. I really wanted it since based on the reviews, there were a bunch of extended remixes on it. I've got most of the other tracks already. However, when it arrived, it turns out it only contains one disc, not two. There are no remixed tracks. Just 21 tracks and not even in the same order as listed on the track listing on this page. Needless to say I'm very disappointed and I feel badly that my friend paid out nearly $20 for something I don't really need."
3,The Most Complete Album From Bangles To These Days!,"I bought this album 2 years ago and it has all their hits and includes a bonus cd with their remixes, I think I'm lucky to have this one because,as I read in other reviews today it doesn't have the bonus cd with the remixes, That's why I rated with 3 stars, now."
3,"Pretty Catchy,Pretty Good","this is a Feel Good Group.the Bangles had Catchy Songs.Walk Like an Egyptian,If She Knew What She Wants,Hero Takes a Fall,Walking down your street.but it was The PRINCE SOng Manic Monday that took them over the top.that Song Captures The 60's Vibe in Early 80's Material.The Bangles had some Good Moments&this Set Captures that."
3,Jessica Alba is Paranoid,"If you are buying this for Jessica Alba nudity, don't. The story line is good and the acting is above average. However, this movie is nothing special."
2,One of The Worst Movies Ever,"I'm sorry, this movie is one of the worst movie I've seen in a while. I am a big Jessica Alba fan, but that doesn't mean I'll like this movie ... I must say I'm not surprise Jessica did it, It was one of those things she started with. But hopefully Jessica won't be caught died doing another... movie like this."
1,Paranoid,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen Jessica Alba in. Even her acting was poor. But then, I can't blame the girl. They didn't give her any good stuff to work with. She's a good actress, but sometimes, even that can't change the fact it was a crappy movie.It's very predictible and boring too. I don't need much to be entertained, but really, this is really bad. The story itself wasn't all that bad. Actually, it could've turned out to be a good movie, but it didn't. That's a shame.If you're an Alba fan, you could go and watch this movie, (she can't help it; she's always beautiful) but I don't recommend it. Buy Dark Angel season one and season 2 instead."
3,Okay movie,"The movie itself is okay. It's perhaps too predictable. Not particularly memorable, although Jessica Alba fans will probably like it.Mastering of the DVD was very poor. It's fullscreen only, black levels, color, and contrast are terrible. It is closer to VHS quality than DVD quality."
4,Nice suprise.,The only reason i bought this DVD was because Jessica Alba was in it. SO i really wasn't excpecting much but was plesently suprised that it was actually a good movie. Good performances by all. Definatly worth checking out.
2,Could've been better,"I only got this movie because Jessica Alba was on it, just because sh is in it doesnt mean that i like it. The movie was horrible to be honest, the story is good, but the movie is boring. Maybe if they only changed the location and raise the suspense a little, then it would have been a great success."
2,Sentimental.,This is certainly not Fontane's best book.The theme of a marriage of convenience and of social respectability is today a little bit out of date.The writing is sometimes too sentimental and the end is without surprise.
5,Clearly always will be Snoop's Best!!!!!,Big Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle!! is easily 1 of the my FAV albums of all time!!!!! everysingle song on this is A class material!i will never ever get sick of this album!!!!but i do have a favourite song which is.....Ain't No Fun!!!!!!!if for some reason u dont have this album!!!! u really shood go and get it!!!!! it is worth every cent!!u gotta luv snoop! even though he'z changed
5,CLASSIC BY THE SNOPPY D-O-G-G,"This is Snoop's best album. The beats are classic old school. The beats are great, since Dr. Dre produced them. The rapping is the old school type. Snoop's voice on his album isn't like it is now. It's cooler and makes the songs better. The flows are great, too. Most of the songs talk about getting high, pimpin, having sex and partying all night. But that doesn't bother me. As long as the songs are tight, I'm OK with it. All the songs are good, but the best ones are: G Funk Intro, Gin n Juice, Lodi Dodi, Murder Was The Case, GZ And Hustlas, Serial Killa, and Who Am I.If you want to hear some good old-school rap or just a big fan of Snoop Dogg, you gotta buy this album."
1,I feel cheated,"Don't get me wrong, I love this CD for the most part, but when they remastered the CD they left my absolute favorite track off. Most of you who've bought the CD probably notice that it ends at track 18 with a track called ""Pump Pump."" However, I dubbed the tape off of the original CD when it first came out (my older brother has a copy) and there are two differences. 1.) ""Tha Next Episode"" is listed as a track on the cover, and I'm guessing the track got cut from Snoop's album at the last minute, then Dre put in on The Chronic 2000 when he got the chance. 2.)there are 19 tracks on the original master. Track 19, entitled ""Gz Up Hoes Down"" was my favorite track, and I was utterly distraught to find it was cut from the remastered release, which is the only one you can find in stores now. I try not to download music off the internet, but now I think I will so I can get this track. To my knowledge, it's not on any other CD currently available. Big disappointment."
4,Doggystyle,"The cd is good, but definently not his best. It has a few good songs like ""Gin and Juice"" and ""What's my Name"", but compared to all the other gangsta 90's westcoast thug rap, this isn't that great."
4,4 1/2 stars. Pretty Good.,"This cd is not too bad. There are very few low points in this recording. There are many high points such as tha shiznit, who am i, doggy dogg world, and ain't no fun. This is a great cd, much better than the chronic. I would rate it even with tha dogg pound. Both cd's have strong beats and lyrics. It was worth the money i paid for it. It's a classic and one of the better cd's from deatrow. The few low points include serial killa and for all my.... Still this is a very good cd and i would stronly recommend that you buy this recording."
5,A RAP CLASSIC,This Disc is still Slammin'&SNOOP's Best all the way thru.HIM&Dre are UnFadeable TOgether.Ain't No Fun Is Still The Jam.Hearing Snoop Then&Now Is Very telling cuz He was Gamed Back then.Now He GOes Thru The Motions Too Much.But their was a Time when He Had THE VOICE IN RAP.if He&DRE Could Have Stayed Together then it would Have Been Over for everybody else.cuz Snoop Was Michael Jackson To Dre's Quincy Jones.Unstoppable&this Disc Proves that Point.SO Much Talent on This Disc.The Grooves Never end.
5,snoop rulz tha world,"All of snoops music's good, the doggystyle cd is his best. Get this one and all the others cause snoop rules."
5,The best of Snoop,The original gangsta. Nobody is cooler than snoop dogg. Nobody! This is the best of the best. This is a classic. You need to get it if you're into 90's rap instead of the crap we have now.
5,Tha Realest,You are not a true hip hop fan if you do not own this cd.and notorious big- ready to die tupac- all cd's jay-z- all cd's
4,Ain't Nuthin' Changed,"This is one of a batch of May 2001 released Death-Row remasters of popular Death Row produced albums. This cd also includes a cd-video not available on the original. If you already own Doggystle, this cd-extra isn't worth the extra money. The ""improved"" sound isn't something you can hear unless you own a [very expensive] stereo system. Instead, you should check out the import version, also available on Amazon, which some reviewers claim has some extra tracks not on this remastered version or the original."
5,mmmmmmmmmmmmm!,Doggy Style was the first solo outing by Snoop Doggy Dog. Incorporating a straight gangsta vibe into the deep funk grooves pioneered by George Clinton and his Parliament-Funkadelic ensemble. Snoop's lazy-yet-acrobatic rap/drawl is distinctive and undeniably entertaining. With additional vocals from Tha Dogg Pound this disc is deceptively professional and musically quite slick.
1,the final death nail for hip-hop,"THIS WAS WHEN I REALIZED THAT HIP-HOP'S CREATIVITY DIED WITH THIS RECORD WHATEVER SKILLS SNOOP HAS IS DROWNED WITH HIS TYPICAL TALES OF HATRED FOR WOMEN AND SMOKING HERB AND VIOLENT GUNPLAY FROM A MIDDLE - CLASS PREACHER'S KID WHO NEVER SAW NEITHER (HE LIVED IN LONG BEACH) WHILE UPPER-CLASS WHITE KIDS CAN SLUM GHETTO FANTAISES FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER LIVED THIS LIFESTYLE, IT HAS DONE MORE DAMAGE TO INNER-CITY BLACK KIDS KIDS AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP THERE THIS IDIOT IS A PIMP ALRIGHT SELLING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION FOR A GENERATION OF BLACK KIDS THE BEATS ARE TIGHT BUT LISTEN TO THE LYRICS AND THEN YOU WILL THROW THIS CD IN THE TRASH.""ONLY SOMEONE WHO NEVER CAME FROM THE GHETTO WILL CELEBRATE IT ""P.S. IF PEOPLE ARE SO BLOW AWAY BUY THE MUSIC GO BUY WHERE THEY ""STOLE "" THOSE BEATS GET PARLIAMENT-FUNKADELIC ALBUMS FROM 1970-1980 MOST ARE ALL ESSENTIAL"
2,A disappointment,"Snoop Dog was everywheres for the past few years..TV, Commerical, movies...you name it, he did it. Probably for the money because he couldnt rap about hos and weed. He is one dimensional, although he has a cool, unmistakable voice. Too bad he wasted his talent. To me he released only two cds worth listening to- Dr. Dre's The Chronic (Why does Dre put his name on cds and its a different artist on mostly every track but a couple, anyone notice that?) and this cd. This cd was praised for the longest time. The raps are good, the beats are so so but its the same old crap over and over. Can he think of anything else to rap about? I know your name is Snoop Dog, you like sex and weed..please tell me more."
2,Worse then 50.,"This is an example of self-confidence gone too far. Almost every track on this album talkz about Snoop, and how he's got all the girls, and how no one will ever touch him in the West Coaster Rap Wars. Don't buy this album. Period."
1,YO homies!,"YO dogg! dis be off da hizzle foshizzle! This be shizzle but da rap is no fizzy of da sheezzy when your hangin on da lizzy foshizbee! But snoop dogg cant rapp da shizzy of da hizzy forshizzly in the fizzy yo hizzy! Shizz da BIZZY! Seriously, he'z not da hizzy only the fizzy mizzy. now swallow this jizzy!"
4,I love this album even though I don't like rap,The first time I heard this I did not know who Snoop Dogg was. I thought it sounded more like R&B than rap. I like this whole album how he has merged the styles of R&B and rap into his own sound. Parents should definitely heed the explicit lyrics warning.
5,Snoop Doggy Dogg,Awesome! This has to be the best muther f*cking debut in the world! A really cool hits cd Cool Tracks like Gin And Juice'Who Am I this is a really cool Cd Buy It If U don't Have it
3,DOGGY STYLE JUS' HOW I LIKE IT,BOMB ISH HOMIE NIZZLE PICK THIS CIZZLE DIZZLE UP FO' RIZZLE! THIS ISH OFF THE HOOK OFF THA CHAIN IN DA SKREETS U KNO' HOW WE DO HOLLA! SNOOPY GOT DAT BLING BLING HOMIE THAT'S OFF THA CHIZZAIN AND THE BIZZLES ALL OVER MY DIZZLE WHEN I BUMP DIS IN MY FLY RIDE! GANGSTA STYLE FO REAL DOGG THIS BUMPS LIKE A FAT BIATCH RUNNIN ON A TREADMIZZLE! I'M OUT HOLLA AT YA BOY WESTSIDE EASTSIDE GANGSTA PLAYA FO LIFE!
3,"""AWOL"" ALBUM""","I paticularly could have waited a little while longer for a better attempt at a better album but, i guess when your starving for new talent you will except anything. WITH the death of N.W.A. and the emergence of ice cube you have to want something to compare to cube which nothing dosen't but you gladly except anything new, with that said honestly there aren't many tracks on this album that make me say ugh! compared to cube all we really hear is snoop laced over dre beats. IF you really want a decent album snatch that greatest hits album and you'd really be satisfied."
5,Classic,"This is one of the best hip hop albums ever. Snoop kills beats with his flow. All the songs on here are top notch, no fillers at all. His cover of Slick Rick's La Di Da Di (Lodi Dodi) is just as good as Rick's, if not better, and the beat is ill. Dre took his production to a new level on this cd. Everyone should have this album. Snoop is calm through most of the songs. This is gangsta-pimp rap. You can listen to this album while driving your car, having a barbecue, or going to bed. By the way, Deeyar's reviews are all plagiarized. Look at his review of this album below. I just looked at a bunch of his other reviews and googled them and he copied them word for word. His reviews should be deleted. Taking credit for someone else's work? What a phoney."
5,Doggystyle is rife with beauty,"I like to listen to Doggystyle late at night when the moon is out and cry. So passionate, so wonderful, Snoop Doggy Dogg is both a poet and a saint."
5,"E.D. Daniels, suck a d*ck!","This E.D. Daniels guy is about to get a kick, punch, slap, drop kick, something pain full if he doesn't shut the f*ck up. Saying Snoop ain't a g, and you know everything, you'd know wouldn't you. Not. Saying him Dre and Tupac didn't grow up in the ghetto. Well they did so you f*ckin sixth grader. Do your homework. Like anyones gonna take any notice of someone who bad mouths one of the greatest rap albums in history. You must have gotten dissed when you tried to get their autographs, its the only explanation. Or have you validated the fact that people can have an ignorance level that high? This guy is wack.This album absolutely rulz. The beats are fantastic, Snoop is fantastic. Every track on this is literally a classic. No fillin, just gangsta rap straight from Cali from a straight gangsta!Fav tracks: Gin And Juice, Tha Shiznit, Lodi Dodi, Murder Was The Case, Who Am I?, Gz And Hustlas"
3,pretty good,"this is the best of snoop right here. Ever since he left deathrow his music just aint as good. However he did very well on Dr. Dre 2001 & The Marshal Mather's Lp.Oh well, thats just my opinion"
3,CJ Pretty Good Album,"This album is good. It is not great. It is not horrible. This album is good and that is it. The beats on this cd are absolutely amazing. Dr. Dre is and always has been one of the best producers in the game and he shows it here. The only thing that brings this album down is the lack of lyrical content. The whole cd is about drugs, sex, and violence. It easily earned the parental advisory label and I dont think that this is a cd you would play at a family reunion or a Birthday party. Overall, this cd earned the three stars and that is it.RecommendationsTupac-All Eyez on MeTupac-Me Against The WorldJay-Z-Reasonable DoubtMobb Deep-InfamousKanye West-College Dropout"
5,Tha Bomb,"No Doubt, the greatest album to ever hit the streets.The year this album came out, people didn't even have CD-Players. HAHAHAH!Everybody would have clips and jack this album. If you had this Tape or CD, you got jacked like 6 times!!!. Greatest CD of all time even the songs that are not classics are still listenable"
5,Best ever!,This is easily the greates rap cd in music history. A classic and no cd collection would be complete without it. It features absolutely no dour songs and even the skits are hilarious. Snoop created this masterpiece in 93 and even today it maintains is greatness.
2,Love This Album But Its Just Stupid To Have The Curses Skipped Around...,"I Loved This Album,When I Downloaded It It Had 13 Tracks instead of 18. And They Were the Clean Versions,Look Into Further Research Before You Buy This..."
3,Snoop Dogg- Doggystyle my rating is misleading.,"3 Stars (with skits)/5 Stars (without skits)5 Stars- Tracks 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 184 Stars- Tracks 2, 5, 113 Stars- Track 92 Stars- N/A1 Star- Tracks 1, 4, 6, 13, 15, 17Okay before people see the stars I gave this and say WTF let me clarify a few things. I have the import version which has 18 total Tracks. Unfortunately most of these Tracks are skits, which in my rating system automatically get a one star rating. If you take out the skits and the Bathtub intro this album becomes a five star rated album. What I may do from now on is give two ratings at the beginning. I know some people don't even count skits and intros and stuff like that. So yes in reality this is a great Album ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME. Everybody should have this in their collection. This is a Classic from start to finish minus the skits, but even some of the skits have supplied jokes for years. Bottom Line Great Album buy it."
5,G.O.A.T.,This album is not only the greatest rap cd ever made but the greatest cd period. Snoop Doggy Dogg is the greatest rapper that has ever graced the mic. nuff said.
4,The first was the very best.,"Snoop Dogg's debut 'Doggy Style' was another classic in rap/Crip hop history. A Dr. Dre produced album just a year after ""The Chronic"" in 1993. Snoop introduced his layed back G-funk pre-crip hop flow Hit singles like ""Gin & Juice"" ""Whats my name"" ""Murder was the case"" and ""pump, pump"" made Snoop Dogg one of the most successful rapper's in rap/Crip hop history. Any fan of Snoop own's this lp, but for those who don't, let me tell its worth every penny you spend on it."
5,THE guide to Southwest Colorado Flora.,"In my opinion (and possibly in fact), this is the only field guide worth using. Ms. Komarek pays explicit attention to detail, and has created wonderful keys to quickly and reliably identify whatever plant you may be viewing.The book also lists many plants found in the lower elevations surrounding the San Juans, such as Durango, Bayfield, Pagosa, Mancos, and Cortez. If you are serious about plants in this area, or if you would simply like to identify them, this is the book that you need."
2,to small,"i was wanting something bigger, so i was very upset and it was too small it didnt even fit over my head :("
3,Lacks eroticism...,"I thought this was a very cute idea, writing a story about Nancy Drew... except that in this case Nancy is a lesbian! Sadly, it never really gets at all explicit. Mabel just doesn't know how to write fantasy erotica. There's one moment where the two women finally get together, but then it's the next morning and Nancy has left the building! No, I'm not asking for XXX porn, but maybe at least something R-rated? This is PG-13!"
1,A piece of junk,"Worked until U.S. went on daylight savings time and it went crazy. Couldn't reset the time. I purchased 2, 1 for me and the other for a friend. Neither one of could get it to set properly. I took mine to a jeweler and he couldn't set it. I'd like to wear it if someone could set the time."
2,A Customer Review,"I've seen a few examples of 'bending' the Amazon review guidelines so it was only a matter of time before cut'n paste reviews started to appear.As to the album, it is not good. The only songs worth listening to are the 'demo' for 'Windy' and(possibly)'Between the Lines'(but only because it has a playful charm). The majority of the recordings sound like unpolished nearly song-doodles and that's what they are. The thing that really lets it down is, not so much the twee naivety of the lyrics, as the bad singing. I think of myself as pretty tolerant of different vocal styles/sounds but I actually found myself wincing involuntarily during more than half of the songs on this album.This is one set of 'lost treasures' that should have stayed in a locked box."
4,Good snowboard,"My daughter used this and liked it. It does have shorter bindings, so finding boots to fit it were a challenge."
5,BCBGirls Limple,"Adorable and comfortable gladiator sandal. Found these to be true-to-size running a hair on the wide side. Look great with shorts, skirts and capris and always get plenty of compliments."
4,SUPERB,"The rendition by the BARON of all the Christmas carols and tunes is worthwhile listening to. This is a CD not only for Caribbean countries, but, would satisfy peoples of other countries. It was my joy to listen and really appreciate what a true balladier the Baron is. He is not only the King of Soca but a true all-rounder music wise."
2,Good for workstations and home use,"It works well in a simple case - 1 card in 1 box. The Dell server boot up recognizes it and the drives without a hitch.However, don't expect to be able to expand with more cards on 1 server. There is a bios conflict and in the words of the Promise Tech support - ""No 2 Promise Technology Inc. products work on 1 machine"".So either get more ports to start with or stick with Adaptec."
2,What you get is what you pay for,"I bought White W75 the other day, and sewed sleeves of a shirt, curtain perfectly. But certainly I'm not happy with the machine. It took a long time before I was able to actually use it. It's hard to adjust the tension of the top thread and the bottom thread. The tension is supposedly adjustable but the sweet spot is really narrow. It's either loose or the thread snaps. Thread guide near the spool holder doesn't do its job resulting the thread twining around the holder. These two are the major defects of this product. Also the motor makes big rattling noise. Otherwise it's OK for the price.For your information, pitch is not adjustable, no reverse/forward control. Foot pedal is either On or Off (no speed control)."
1,subscription takes forever to arrive,"Well, it's been a little over a month, and still have not received my first issue. Anyone ordering magazines should be aware of this."
1,Uncharacteristically bad Colorstay product!,"Terrible lipstick! Very, very sticky feeling on the lips, and it smears easily. It immediately got on my teeth, and was still there even after I brushed my teeth! I had to use eye makeup remover to take the lipstick off my teeth. True to its name, it does stay on, but that's not a good thing when it's so sticky and messy that you can't wait to get it off. I'm a big fan of Colorstay products, but they missed the boat on this one."
2,Get Part 1 instead,"I think they used up all the 'good' songs on the first On The Rocks compilation - this one seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel a bit. Part 1 is highly recommended for lovers of things tacky, but Part 2 is a bit thin."
4,ultra-lounge: on the rocks part 2,Another interesting collection in the long series from Capitol Records from the late 90's of Ultra Lounge cds. I wish that Capitol Records would have be now reissued most of Les Baxter's Lps from the 50's on cd instead have having to purchase imports that piece-meal the original lps.
5,My 5 year old daughter adores this album.,"My 5 year old daughter adores this album from start to finish, especially Puff and Man Come Into Egypt. She has been exposed to a variety of types of music, including Vivaldi, Bartok, Stravinsky, Copland, Prokofiev, Mahler, Bach, Handel, Beatles, Crosby Stills & Nash, Byrds, Kraftwerk, Human League, Yardbirds, B52s, Harry Belafonte, Judy Collins, Johnny Mathis, Byron Berline (bluegrass), The Coasters, The Temptations, The Drifters, Lesley Gore, and The Chipmunks. But she likes the album Moving the best. My daughter ""owns"" this album, because she has formulated a special solo dance for some of the songs on the album. It might be noted that her second favorite song is Windigo by Jim Post ..., while her third favorite is Yellow Submarine by the Fab Four."
5,"wnenever this title's songs listened,i felt comfortly",sometimes differented eastern's favorite songs from american's my country people liked 'gone the rainbow' rather than 'puff' such as johnny horton's 'all for the love a girl'elvis presley's 'anything that part of you' lobo's 'stoney'joan baez's 'the river in the pines'paul anka's 'papa'...etc
5,Belly Dance & Violin,Wonderful cd of Arabic belly dance music - different from Egyptian belly dance music. Great pieces that are good for dance or for listening.
5,Early American Rebel,"I was looking for a soldier's account of the Revolutionary War and came across this rare memoir in the Jamestown, Virgina Nationa Park Service bookstore. I sure was glad I did.I have read many soldier's memiors from from all periods of time but never during the Revolutionary War. We have heard about the sufferings of our country's first soldiers but Martin tells us like it was as he lived it. There is not a lot of battle descriptions but he is a master story teller who will take you back in time to the days of the colonies and George Washington's army during America's struggle for independence.If you love good personal history narratives and want to learn about the Revolutionary War then get this book. This would be an excellent book for classroom study or home school."
4,Marvin Gaye - In performance 1964-1981,A pleasure to watch and listen to one of the greatest entertainers who lost his life so tragically. A must for every Marvin Gaye fan.
4,Marvin Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi, this is a great DVD, but hey what happened to the other one I saw with 25 full length performances, the same title from Amazon.com which came on sale on Monday April 17th 2006.Please Amazon.com don't mislead your customers, you're here to satisfy us and to be the best company out there. So is that DVD with 25 full length performances still available or was that your mistake........Cause I would like to really purchase it. Let me know!!!!!!!! So I leave 4 stars for that reason alone."
3,Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing - In Performance 1964-1981,"I was looking forward to getting this Vidio as it was a suprise for my wife. The only problam with it was that when it came it was in a American format and would not play on any of my DVD players. I could not see the sense in sending it back at the price it was, so I changed the format on my computer and made a copy so that I could play it on my dvd players."
5,Marvin Gaye :The Real thing (1964-81),"I was very pleased with the DVD Real thing: In Performance 1964-1981. Since I am a fan of Marvin Gaye, I was very happy to find out that Amazon had this type of movie. It was clear and brought back my childhood music. The price was even a good buy."
5,That's my favourite country-rock album,"When I heard Walkin' the Country on CMT, I said:""man, that's just the sound I was looking for..."", and hurried up to buy the CD. I was so glad to listen to such a wonderful work.... just one more thing: I am still waiting for their next CD..... don't make me wait for so long, Ranch!!!"
5,The Greatest Black western ever told,"This book reads extremely well from front to back. Lanquage as well as the story flows smoothly. Full of action and vigilante type justice which was par for the course at the time of the story. The main character in the book was described so vivdedly, and his life from a small boy to a man goes along unimpeded. This is one that should have made the big screen in Hollywood. I probably will read it several more times."
3,CCNP Study Guides,"I used all four books and the Boson prep testing software to complete my CCNP tests. The books have many errors that are not mentioned in the errata sheets. In my opinion, the Switching book is the strongest, Remote Access is acceptable, Support is lacking in key areas (ISDN) and the Routing (especially access lists, OSPF and BGP topics) is unacceptable. I purchased the Cisco press books for Routing and Support. The Cisco books cover the material more accurately and in greater detail.If you are already familiar with the material and just need to refresh your memory, these are probably sufficient. If you are learning a specific topic like BGP for the first time or want to have a better understanding of the material, get the Cisco books."
3,Disappointed!,"I studied sybex ccna book for my ccna exam. It was amazing. I scored 935 without taking a course etc. Just 2 weeks of study with that book, boson router sim and boson exams. So I bought this set to study for those ccnp exams. I read the routing book first and tried some boson exams in order to evaluate myself. I was awful! and I assure you that was not my fault!I could not efford to buy another book about routing so I switched to the switching exam. And I wasted 2-3 weeks with that book too!! At first, that book seems to be satisfactory but if you read the exam topics on cisco web site, you will see that some of them are not even mentioned in that book.Today, I am going to start reading a cisco press book for that switching exam. I suggest you do the same and save money!"
5,Jon secada is a great solo artist,he is one of the best male artists around! I love too late to soon and the remix. The love songs are great balanced with some love/dance songs!
2,"Seems to work well, but unacceptably noisy","Despite there being no customer reviews for this item, I took a chance on it because it was the only compact Firewire hub without complaints about its performance or high-pitched whine that other hubs in its class, like the Kensington PocketHub, reportedly exhibit.These manufacturers must all be buying the same faulty components, because the IOGear has the same very noticeable whine, which you can hear as soon as you plug it into your computer and attach devices (in my case, a bus-powered hard drive and CompactFlash reader).That said, I'm not sure whether or not to return it. So far I've had no problems with data transfer between my MacBook and either of the storage devices I've attached. As annoying as the whine is, I can just work with headphones on when it's in use, and the noise is barely worse than my CPU fans. It's better than lugging around a larger hub when I'm traveling."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,This is the most useless product I have ever bought! Why in the world would anyone want a firewire port if it attaches to another firewire port. I needed something that attaches to a USB port since that's all we have on our computers! Why don't they make something like that?
1,No es lo que dicen,"La razon por la que yo compre este CD fue por que en la informacion del producto decia que este CD contenia los temas ""los restos de Santiago"" y ""Aicha"" lo cual no es verdad,ya que estos temas fueron parte de la edicion especial de ""Nueva Era"" y al parecer esta tienda no la tiene solo tienen la edicion regular,Asi que si su interes en este disco son los temas mencionados no lo compren pues no los contiene.La tienda se porto nada profesional cuando envie un par de e-mails para dejarles saber que su producto no era lo que yo queria ya que nunca me respondieron asi que sugiero que piensen dos veces antes de comprar de la tienda ""Galaxi"""
3,I was expecting something different,"I love the music of Amistades peligrosas but I frankly was expecting something else from this cd. I like most of the songs but it doesn't have the daring lyrics I was hoping to hear from them like the ones on ""me haces tanto bien"", some sound kind of good advise from your parents which to me is boring. Number 1 and number 11 and 12 are fantastic."
5,Exellent,"I don't why someone would not like this CD. They are great songs something new by the group and unfortunately their last new CD. I think this CD has great songs with some great lyrics to them. If you listen to their songs over their course as a group, Amistades Peligrosas sings about everything ranging from sex to religion. The name of the group and first album Relatos de una intriga is taken from the intro to Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses which translates into English as Dangerous friendships, and into Spanish as Amistades Peligrosas. I would recomend to everybody to get all four of the groups albums but if you only want one get the greatest hits CD but I still think youi will be missing some great songs that are on the other CDs. Anyways, ENJOY!"
1,"Good Voice, Bad Songs","All I can say about this CD is that I was so upset with the songs. Most of them got no interesting story to tell, unlike good songs that always do. I admit that he got a great voice, probably one of the most talented singers in the industry, but... If only he got better materials to record. He should learn something from his first album. 'Every light In The House' is still one among my all time favorits. Hope that he could get back on track ASAP"
3,"Big Time,",Just Like Comin' On strong this is not one Of Trace Adkins best cd's It has only two enjoyable songs which is Big Time & See Jane Run.If You Liked This Cd Check Out His Others1. Songs About me2. Greatest Hits Vol. 13. Comin' On Strong4. More5. Dreamin' Out loud6. Chrome
5,I loved it,"Wayfaring stranger, a song written over 200 years ago, has never been better than the way Trace does it. I will buy more of his recordings."
5,mother-in-law gift and she was thrilled,my mother-in-law had mentioned she wanted a Trace Adkins song but couldn't find it in the music stores. I found it on Amazon and she was thrilled.
4,very good,Good CD. Trace is always good. This was one of the first CD's for him. He did very well.B. Comstock
2,So glad I didn't buy it,"Although Anthony is a unique hero -- not drop-dead gorgeous or arrogant, but very charming and easy-going -- the plot is so unbelieveable and Georgy's adamant refusals of his attentions are incomprehensible. The secondary romance is also unlikely, although enjoyable to read (and that male a bit wishy-washy). Georgy's little sister is delightful and one of the best characters in the book. The interaction between the two leads in minimal; more happens to each one apart from the other than occurs with them together. Thus, we never get to see the relationship develop and it comes across as artificial."
2,Bad battery,"The watch is fine, but the battery died the first week. Seems like this must have been in stock a looooong time."
5,Love it!,This watch is just as pretty as it appears. Works really well and is dainty but easy to read. I'm very happy with it.
5,Satisfied Group,Books in Excellent condition. Speedy delivery and multiple qty a plus for group study. Very precise and informative for class/personal study. Future orders from supplier recommended. Thank You Very Much.
3,Too much caffeine in the writer's Java,"I'm an Idiot, so, I know what I'm, talking about. In an Idiot's book the writing style should be concise-it wasn't. He went into irrelevant analogies which just bored, he repeated himself, yes, he repeated himself. He introduces a new word and then defines it at the end of the paragraph. INTRODUCE-DEFINE-EXPLAIN-EXAMPLES-SUMMARISEI'll read again"
3,"Perfect for ""Complete Idiots""","The writing style of the Author left a great deal to be desired. The writing style was very American (perfect for Americans) but many of the metaphors which he uses to convey concepts just made things harder. For example, he is trying to explain that ""Run"" and ""Execute"" are the same thing. To do this he uses a basket ball analogy, where a play is ""Run"" and afterwards people say it was well ""Executed"". Frankly, just telling me the two words meant the same thing was enough for me. The book also took too long to get into any detail. The pages were cluttered, having captions on almost every page which squeezed text and code into small (harder to read) sections. Otherwise the explanations were clear and there was enough source code for you to catch on. One large plus is the apparent lack of typos!!"
2,"If you WANT to feel gloomy, it's powerful in a positive way","So you've either been looking for the version of ""When Doves Cry"" that was in the movie, or the first soundtrack wasn't enough. Well, if the former is true, you simply have to decide whether it's worth it to buy a whole album for one song. But in the other scenario, you have a bigger problem. This album is nothing like the first. I enjoy instrumental music, but this CD just depresses me. The album is amazing in that it has so much power to bring a person down. ""O Verona"" is great when you want to crank it up and yell along with the music, and the instrumental version of ""Kissing You"" is incredible. The second half of the album, however, actually made me cry...something a CD without memories attached to it has never done before. Buy it if you're really into classical or if you noticed that you enjoyed the background music during the movie. Do not buy it if you're looking for an encore to the first soundtrack."
4,i love this movie,i love the kissing you instrumental piece.. on the part where they are on the elevator and the balcony scene. the music fits the scenes PERFECTLY. beautiful performances by leo and claire too. it all falls perfectly together.
4,Captures The Feel of The Film,"This is an exciting and beautifully composed music CD. Almost every track contains short pieces of dialogue from the movie, which I find to be one of its best features. This is definitely a soundtrack that lives up to the hip and modern attitude of the film it's from. I like this volume even better than the first. #2, #9, #11, and #21 really got my attention."
5,Cool and spiritual,"This CD was almost better than vol.1 because, instead of just making a sound track, it interpreted the mood in the movie at that time. The 'Death Scene'was particularly touching. But the very best thing is that even though the music can be melancholy, it's never wimpy, just beautiful..."
3,A 3 only because its an Elizabeth Lowell book,"Even though I am working my way through every one of her books as I have thoroughly enjoyed most of them, I agree with most of the negative reviews. I would probably still read it, however. It was very hard to understand in several parts, and I believe that several incidents in the book were never explained. I had to go back and re-read the last chapter and a few other parts, and I am still not satisfied.Like I said, I would still read it if you are a fan. Some of her books are definitely better than others."
1,The Worst Book Ever,"I rarely take the time to review books or other items, but this book is just SO BAD I feel the need to let others know. In a word it is Bizarre. I am sorry I wasted the time on this one, I just kept thinking that the ending might redeem the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Tedious,"I listened to the MP3 version of this book. It was totally boring and irritating. (I kept listening because I was a captive audience and I wondered what the end twist would be. Unfortunately, it was just ugly.)Maybe when you hear the repetition involved in the way in which the characters speak to one another, it's worse because you don't skim it. Each time one character spoke to another, their conversation included a lesson in genealogy or some other topic. They never had ordinary--let alone sparkling or interesting--conversation! I agree with others--where is the EL who has written so many GOOD stories? Skip this one."
3,Plodding,"One of the best things about most of the books Elizabeth Lowell writes is her research, which can enhance her work enormously. In this case, however, the intricacies of genealogy weigh the story down at the expense of action and plot. While the characterizations start out strong, they also fall victim to way too many characters and genealogy threads.I read about two-thirds of this book in a day, then didn't pick it up again for weeks because it simply didn't hold my interest. Having said that, if you are interested in genealogy, you will probably enjoy this book a good deal more than I did. But if you're looking for a good romance/suspense novel, you may well be disappointed."
2,Where did Elizabeth Lowell Go?,"Since you already have reviewers who have given you the premise of the book I'll not duplicate. I never write reviews -- this book was so annoyingly poor that I was determined to say something. What happened to Elizabeth Lowell? Where's the author who wrote the other ""Always"" books or the ""Only"" series or the rest of her books?!! The premise was a good idea -- but I think she started to drown in all the characters that had to be brought in to make the premise work. And, one paragraph love scene, does not a Romance Novel make!! By the end of the book I couldn't have cared less about anyone of the characters -- I just wanted the book to be over! Do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback. The hardback was too expensive for the lack of pleasure you receive. Sorry Elizabeth, you're too talented a story teller to sell your public this lackluster excuse for a novel. I gave you two stars because you sat down and tried to write something!"
1,Always time to die,"Dumb. Too convoluted,the plot blew up at the end after pages and pages of exposition about the Governor, who was the murderer and who cares? The geneology was a mess, everyone was everyone else's mother and grandmother or father and grandfather and so inbred it's amazing they could see and walk. I'm sorry I wasted the time. One star is too many."
2,"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!","I cannot believe how slow, confusing and uninteresting this book was! I am a die-hard Elizabeth Lowell fan and this is the first book of hers I have not liked. I understand that she does not want to write novels with heavy character development anymore, but if she is not going to develop the characters, she should at least try to develop the plot in a more interesting way. It was all I could do to finish the book. This book is not up to Elizabeth Lowell's usual standard and I miss her old style of writing in which she develops the relationship between a man and a woman."
2,Lost in a maze!,"I bought this book because it was about three of my favorite things; It was a murder mystery, about a genealogist, and Taos.It became a mire of genealogy charts, DNA tests, families that had intermarried for 100 years, and characters that were dismally boring. Set in the winter, there was no taste of the Taos I know, none of the genealogy that I practice, and by the end I didn't care who had been murdered or who the murderer was!"
3,A captivating look at the work of a genealogist,"It is an intriguing inside look at the terms, search methods, and equipment, a genealogist uses to do her work. Carolina May comes to Taos, New Mexico at the request of Winifred Castillo, the aunt of Josh Quintrell, New Mexico's governor, to do her family's history. The novel starts with the death and burial of the Quintrell family patriarch Andrew Jackson Quintrell, III. Dan Duran and his father mysteriously watch from the distance. The instant attraction that Dan and Carolina feel for one another is not well developed. It does give her a cohort when someone tries their best to convice her to leave and when that does not work, to kill her. The mystery part is well done albeit the ending gets overly complicated. Nevertheless, an enjoyable read."
2,"Genealogy & Taos, OK, plot terrible","As a lover of New Mexico, I enjoyed thoroughly the descriptions of the area around Taos, and the New Mexico flavor. The info about genealological research was there, if you're interested in this sort of thing. But what a convuluted, insane plot! After awhile, the reader begins not to care about who is the second cousin of the illegitimate, incest produced granddaughter of whom. And the sex talk between Dan and Carly--sounds like a high school sophomore wrote it. Again, good book if you've nothing else, but grit your teeth over the plot."
2,What the...?,"I have to mirror some of the other reviews. I can normally read an Elizabeth Lowell book in a day or two; this one took weeks. The book was a slow start, and by the time it ended I was scratching my head. The plot was so convoluted and there were so many people brought up that it was hard to keep track of who was whom and who begot whom. I really hope the next book is better."
2,Always Time to Die,"I won't go over the plot again as it has already been written. Typically, I love Elizabeth Lowell, she in on my automatic buy list. However, this book was a real disappointment! At several points, I would just look at the book and say...""Is this really Elizabeth Lowell""? The book was so heavy with mundane detail that it got in the way of a slow story. The book never really picked up any pace, it just left me with wanting to put it down and not finish. Of course, I did finish but I could have skipped to the last five pages and had my conclusion. Wait for the used paperback."
3,DYING FOR AN ASPIRIN :D,"Good mystery based on a geneology chart and the accuracy of DNA. This mystery was so convoluted, it was more complex than a CSI investigation! At it's root was an ugly secret, altho a good guess would have saved us all a lot of time! I put the book down several times just to clear my thinking.Dan and Carly made a cute duo. And I am certain Ms. Lowell put a terrific amount of research into this book. The last several pages explain everything, I think! I was glad to see this book end. Whew!"
3,Genealogy hobbists will enjoy,Good explanation of DNA research in genealogy. Intricate plot with a cast of characters that was sometimes hard to follow in audiobook version. Great read for those heading to New Mexico for vacation as it gives an interesting history of that area as part of the plot. This is my first Lowell read and I will defintely look for other Lowell books.
1,who wrote this and what have you done with elizabeth?,"Having read most of elizabeth lowell/ann maxwell's books, I was severely disappointed with 'always time to die""...indeedy, quite an appropriate title. There was absolutely no life in this book. I'm almost convinced she didn't write it. Would have given 0 stars, it's that bad.The story has an overcomplicated, confusing plotline involving geneology, New Mexican land inheritance history, and a town full of unlikeable 'hispanos'. Most of elizabeth's books offer entertaining anecdotes, passionate, believable love stories, and interesting research on the part of the author. That's why I can't understand this book - it was uninteresting, the pacing nonexistent, the romance forced, and the storyline boring. The characters, the dialog, the descriptions - not the elizabeth lowell I know and love!I'm hoping that 'elizabeth' does read these reviews, seriously, if this is par for any future books - save the trees by all means!"
3,Just OK,"I love Elizabeth Lowell, but just couldn't connect with this one. It was a little too twisted, and then all of the sudden, it was resolved in the last 10 pages. But, I didn't care. There were too many damaged peopled and you couldn't really believe in any of them. Disappointing."
2,Slow to get going,This is not the best Lowell novel I've ever read. They storyline was slow to get started and wandered around a bit. I would not recommend this book.
5,I love this book & am amazed by the backlash,"I've had this book now since it was released in the UK several years ago and I have to say that I love it. Thomas Beller was a name I'd never heard of so I bought it on a whim and ended up so glad that I did. I've read it now six or seven times and each time I enjoy it as much as the last, maybe even more. Simple but beautiful writing, ""real"" stories of ""real"" lives, humorous in the right places and to see so many people criticizing the book because of Beller's appearance or how he was at school etc. amazes me. Who cares what an author looks like or who he or she is? If a book is good, it's good - period, and I for one wouldn't part with my copy. I give this one an unreserved 5 stars, and I look forward to reading more of his work."
3,A daring homoerotic undertaking,"Thomas Beller's ""Reduction Theory"" is a bold and timely account of a young man's quest to engage in bathroom sex with multiple male partners.Through the eyes of the hero, Alex, the reader is lured to the fascinating underworld of public restrooms. Normally such places are associated with the disposal of digestive toxins, but Beller cleverly reconstructs them as venues of seduction.Dark, smelly and at times lyrical--by the time you finish ""Reduction Theory"", you won't look at a public lavatory the same way again."
1,Isn't there a ZERO stars???,"Oh my! As a big fan of Ian McShane I had wanted the Mini-Series Marco Polo on DVD. McShane is NOT in this film thankfully!!! A friend gave this to me for my birthday, thinking it was the McShane version.Actually, this movie is really good for LAUGHS. This has to the the worst filmed, worst written, worst acted piece of JUNK. Surely, they could not have been that bad on purpose.Do not WASTE your money!"
1,Really Bad Movie,"I'm a high school history teacher and I though I might look at this movie to see if I could use it. Most Hollywood movies are not very accurate but they help students get a visual of the times. However, this movie is sooooo bad even ignorant teenagers would throw their books at the screen.Do NOT buy this movie!Dean from Knoxville"
2,well made flop,"disappointed to See Jack Palance in this well made flop, things run slow, acting is for the dogs, only 1 channel of rather bad sound and very patchy plot, hero attempt fails from the start, made me go to sleep"
2,"Probably a one, but I'll give it two for camp.","Straight to video release of a very bad movie. The only actor you'll recognize (unless you're a big fan of soap operas) is Jack Palance. Unless you're into cheesy Barbarian-Sci-Fi, I'd recommend staying away from this one."
2,Marco Polo,"The back of the dvd case says it has interactive menus, like a trailer, cast and crew biographies and Spanish subtitles but I dont see them on the dvd itself. I dont know if I got a different version of the dvd itself since its a used one.The scenes look like props really. Acting by most is amateurish. Don and some of the others in the cast, I am sure have done much better before and after this movie. Thanks!"
3,"Overall, a good book","Overall, ""Baja California Plant Field Guide"" is a good book for the naturalist. However, its design may not help the begginer since it assumes that the readear has a well developed knowledge in plant morphology. Introductions to Baja California and its bioregions are very good but the section for plant identification may cause some trouble to the naturalist that is trying to identify a new plant species (unless it is a common one). If the book is re-edited it might be good to incorporate a format similar to some bird guides and particularly, newer plant guides."
4,Good Guide for those New to the Baja Peninsula,This is an adequate field guide for those new to Baja. The classisfication system was not as well organized or indexed at the beginning as I would have preferred.
5,Great book,I got this book because it was free and I loved it there was a huge twist at the end that I didn't see coming. I would definitely tell my friends to read this book
5,Still lively and fresh,"It's Like This, Cat is a simply wonderful story of teen angst, cats, human relationships, and a vanished New York City. It's not an animal story, though Cat is the catalyst (pun intended) in the events. With Cat as the impetus, Dave explores his world, populates it with eccentrics and matures. The reader is right there with him as he goes on his first date, learns what makes a true friend, and comes to an understanding with his parents.I'd forgotten all about this book until I came across it on Project Gutenberg when I was looking for free books to download onto my new e-reader. I reread it in a couple of hours and marveled at how Emily Neville captured Dave's world. I don't know how this book would appeal to post-millenial pre-teens, but it sure enchanted this middle-aged adult for the second time since 1964."
5,This book was wonderful and exciting!,"This was a most exciting book! I loved It. I would encurage anyone to read it! But especaly all people who like animals and exitment because this book goes from a day at the beech, to an exiting adventure! You will not want to put this book down!"
3,"New York, New York","Emily Neville does a pretty good job capturing everyday life for a teenage boy. Her style is fluid and quick to read. The reader follows the main character through a year in New York city. The characters are fairly realistic if not a bit stereotypical.One of the downsides to the book is that it was anticlimactic. The changes that occurred in the main character were minor and predictable. There was also a passage that was unnecessarily violent, and it cast a pall on the rest of the story. It's not at the top of the Newbery list, but a decent book nonetheless."
3,Very Nice but....,"Made me extremely sad that the author had to kill off a kitten, AND in a terrible way as well.What was the point? There were so many other alternatives for ending this book....!"
2,A very boring read!,"B O R I N G ! ! !I was very disappointed when I read this book. I chose to read this book because it had so many good reviews and awards like the 1964 Newbery Medal Award and was a Notable Childrens Book of 1940-1970. I also chose this book because I love cats. I couldn't believe how boring it was when it had so many high quality awards! The reason I think this book is so dull is because it had no plot or problem to solve. The book is about a boy growing up in New York City, not getting along with his father and owning a pet cat named Cat. BORING! For one thing, the cat is named Cat. It sounds like the author was having a bad day and couldn't think of a better name. If anyone sees the book, It's like This, Cat by Emily Cheny Neville on a shelf somewhere, don't bother reading it, it's really boring. -Rachel Milliken"
4,Nice little read,"This book is written for the young teen but it's a nice book for anyone. I remember reading it when I was very young when it first came out, and the story always stuck with me. We seem to think that our pets are along with us for the ride but usually it's the other way around, and they can and do have profound influences on our lives and where we end up. It's also a nice perspective of a young teen growing up in New York City, as I grew up in a small town and the ease which the main character and his friends use the subway and bus systems to go for miles, being out in the big city on their own as such young ages, is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps in the timeline of this book it was a safer environment, but it's refreshing nonetheless."
5,I can understand why it has a newbery award,"It was marvelous, spectacular, genius, excellent, ete. One of my favorite books Ive ever read. I can connect to the book a lot because I used to live in New York and the setting is in New York, I knew almost all the streets this book was talking about. This book is very good with explaining things and putting it in details, If I could I would read it again."
2,Lacking Plot,"I read this book to help my son with his book report. I'm in awe that this book won a Newbery award. It tells about some exploits of a boy and his cat, but lacks a main plot. There isn't much action. I kept waiting for something to happen, maybe a twist at the end about Tom's dad. I was pretty disappointed at the end.My son has had problems finding good books to read for book reports. So many revolve around female main characters and narrators. He picked this book because it has a male main character and a cat - my son loves cats. Sadly this book is missing something vital."
3,OK BOOK FOR AGES 11 OR 10 AND UNDER,"I am 13 and I just finished this book. I got this book when I was about 8 years old but I never read it. It's not the type of book that I enjoy reading(I am a fan of horror books), but a 10 or 11 year old would probably enjoy it. Here's a bit of advice though DON'T DO A BOOKREPORT ON THIS BOOK. I felt that there was not really a main problem. There were small problems here and there, but there wasn't a real problem. That's another reason why I did not really enjoy this book."
2,Disappointing,"I'm always on the lookout for a good fantasy writer, and I had hoped Hunter was one. No such luck. The plot wanders with little direction from villain to seemingly indestructable villain, each of whom is dispatched in about four pages. The characters create neither sympathy nor revulsion - there is just very little here to care about. There are some inventive (fantasy) ideas, but nothing of interest to hang them on. Don't bother."
4,Caught me by surprise!,"I'd have to say this book was a complete surprise to me from what I was expecting. Right from the first chapter I was hooked and found it held my interest right to the end. The story was interesting as were the characters. It had a touch of fairytale, macabe, humor, romance great characters and lots of surprises.Kim Hunter doesn't hold back when it comes to gritty discriptions so be prepared to be grossed out at times. He is not afraid to describe things in it's rawest form.This just adds more believability to the story in my opinion. If you like peaches and cream fantasy then this book is not for you. Otherwise give it a try. I don't think you will be disapointed.I'm am definitely looking forward to reading the next book ""Wizard's Funeral"". I'd give this book 4 1/2 stars."
2,Disappointing erratic fantasy,"This book seemed to have great ideas, and I believe the story-line is quite good. The writing style is dry and uninspiring and at times the writer seems to forget previous information about characters and events. Some strange/fanciful events seem to be added for no reason, other than to help the ""hero"" escape from his latest problem, or as an attempt to enliven a part of the book. Towards the end of the book it gets a bit ridiculous.Overall - a great story that is badly told."
1,CD does not play correctly,This CD does not play the last 3 songs; it skips and has blank spots. The CD was advertised as excellent condition.
4,Not bad,"Nascar Road Racing is fun, but it's sort of hard to turn at corners. The names in the stats screen are all messed up. I haven't had any problems with it shutting off or crashing. It's hard to use it when you first get it, but when you get used to it, it's easier. That's why I give it 4 stars."
3,5/10,"First, this game was released before Windows XP was. That said, I couldn't get video in Windows ME, but it ran fine under Windows XP.Second, your controller options are severely limited. I am using an automatic transmission, because I can't switch the upshift and downshift buttons.Third, the game is fun, for the sake of being fun. I have Race, Race 07, GTR, GTR 2, GP3, GP4, and a whole bunch of other racing games. This game is just plain fun. I can't play it with my steering wheel, and I can't tweak the car to my liking, but with a simple gamepad, you can kill some time on a three hour flight.Overall, there are better racing sims, but this one is for those that cannot deal with the good ones and for those that just want something to kill some time."
2,"Nice at first, don't hold up well.","I bought many pairs over time and came to realize they weren't holding up well for long. Have since moved on to a similar style made of coolmax polyester that fit and work the same, feel as comfortable against the skin but last much longer that natural cotton fabric."
1,Okay but not what was expected.,I bought a pair by all the positive reviews I saw. Truth is they are not as supportive as advertised. It could be just me but I found that regular Hanes boxer briefs are more supportive and cheaper. I was disappointed with the fit but am gonna try to wash and really dry them a couple more times and maybe my opinion will change.
4,Comfortable - Runs big,"These are really comfortable. They run big though. I have about a 31-32"" waist and usually wear a med. However the mediums were really big. I was worried the smalls would be too small but they fit much better. If you are on the border consider the smaller size. I also wish they would offer these in a 2 pack of black only since the gray is not 100% cotton."
2,midnight sons 1 2 3,"I have read all 3 books and was glad I had all in hand before reading, I thought the outcomes were very predictable, I was disapointed that there was not more substance to the characters. If I had not had all 3 it would have been hard to follow. Hard Luck, Alaska was a great setting for these books, life is hard and time moves slowly when far removed from cities and family"
4,Ex-Tangerine Dream man moves on,"Peter Baumann left Tangerine Dream in the late 1970's and released a few albums before moving on to found Private Records. This album contains selections of that early work. Half of the album is from Baumann's first two, and mostly instrumental CD's Romance 76 and Transharmonic Nights. While the cuts were more structured than his former band, it wasn't until Repeat Repeat where he moved into a more mainstream, early New Wave sound with decent results. The best cuts from that album are contained here. The vocals are mixed, but the arrangements and production are top rate. No cuts are contained from Baumann's 4th album, Strangers in the Night, a slickly produced, but otherwise listenable album that had all but completely removed him from his T Dream days."
5,Great Book,"My teenage son was diagnosed recently with Type 1 Diabetes, it was very scary not knowing anything about Diabetes. This book is easy to understand and it explains everything about Type 1 diabetes. Wonderful help to me."
5,"Dr Stuart Brink, Senior Endocrinologist at NEDEC","Dr Hanas' diabetes instructional manual is well written, easy to read and understand. The book is filled with humor and common-sense advice which is practical, positive and upbeat! Dr Hanas includes the latest medical as well as psychosocial concepts gleaned from years of experience providing care to infants, toddlers, children, adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus aiming for the best glucose control possible. His approach provides information that allows parents and kids to take charge of their own diabetes care and slowly but surely become their own experts. Highly recommended :>Stuart Brink, MD Senior Endocrinologist at NEDEC: New England Diabetes and Endocrinology Center, Waltham, MA, USA and Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA"
5,Review of an excellent book on type I diabetes,"This book is a very well written, clear treatise on insulin dependent diabetes. As a practicing physician and diabetic of 36 years duration, I hiughly recommend it for anyone trying to learn more about this illness which often results in more questions than answers when trying to learn about management and how to approach the problems that one encounters in everyday life with this illness. Unlike many books on this subject it answers more questions than it produces. But it does also ask provocative questions of the reader.leaving the reader with material to discuss with their physicians."
5,A God Send,This book has helped us so much.The doctors don't help you too much so you are left with a million questions and this book has helped so much.This disease is so overwelming and this book is so helpful in easy to understand words.Instead of going into a panic when something happens we now just go to the book and it calms us right down.Thank God this book is here.
4,Great book for any skill level,"I'm a novice fly fisherman and learned a lot from this book. There are so many techniques in this book, that I think even the most advanced fisherman could learn from it, however. I've actually had the opportunity to seen the author of this book in action and he is truly an amazing fisherman."
5,A must have for the tribapella and the cd-rom video,"Yes indeed, Autralians are lucky. They get a video, a screensaver AND an exclusive thunderpuss2001 mix which I like even more than the original thunderpuss2001. This tribapella is a vocal dub mix with a little less sound effects than the original thunderpuss2001 (which is little too loaded in my opinion).One of the best Don't tell me imports (the part1 europe import is not to be missed either for the first thunderpuss mix-2000).Don't you ever tell her to stop."
5,This is a good edition.,I already have an earlier French version and also an earlier edition in English. This one is different.Can I have an E.Book version of this ? Is one available.John.
2,Not effective,"After using this product for nearly a month, I see no improvement in fine lines or elasticity, however, I now have acne. The product feels great when you apply it, but your face feels dry later and needs another application. In addition, I have developed acne. I know new products can cause acne, but typically after a week it clears up. The acne did not clear up for me. I plan to throw out and go back to neutrogena products. I am also using the night shift. I'm not sure which is causing the acne, but I assume both."
1,"Clearly written by a psychotic refusing to take his medication.,","Chamish sees ""writing"" as a substitute for taking his meds. But no one else should waste a nickle on his lunatic ravings and subliterate ""writing""."
2,ehhh,"I am a huge hockey fan, but found the video to be mildly entertaining. Dont expect it to be like Hoop Dreams or FRiday Night Lights."
2,Disappointing,"There is a great film to be made on this topic. Unfortunatley, this one is disappointing. I found that the movie does not capture the excitement, crazy humor and bonding between players, coaches and families that occurs in youth hockey. Hopefully, someone will try again!"
3,The hockey stars listed on the cover have nothing to do with the movie,If you were expecting to see Brendan Shanahan in a staring role think again. This is a story of a youth league team striving for a national title. Ok as a movie in that respect but the stars listed on the cover are very misleading.
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"Wouldn't recommend buying it. If you are dying to see it, try to rent or borrow it from someone."
5,Not Just for Hockey Players and Parents,"This is a great movie for young athletes to see the hard work and dedication necessary to achieve your dreams. My son and his friends watch it constantly as we drive to the rinks for practices and games. For hockey players and parents it will stay in your DVD player. For others, you'll really appreciate the dedication shown by the players and parents. It's tough to play hockey outside of Minnesota and the Northeast when ice rinks are few and far between. The California Wave proved its possible for teams from outside the hockey hotbeds to compete and ultimately claim a national championship. Great job by the producer and director capturing the players and parents and putting it all together into a compelling story. The musical score is outstanding also."
5,Works great with Shimano systems,"This cassette is inexpensive, yet works wonderfully over lots of miles. I have 4,000 miles on one cassette, and bought another for my other road bike, which I have 1000 miles on. Shifts very smoothly, no complaints at all."
5,go to reliability,"I don't even think of trying out some other brand. Excellent value too. Never a broken cog or tooth and I get about 7k dusty miles out of it. Tried a few ""non brand name"" cassettes and they cracked right away."
5,excellent,"excellent replacement, you may need to have mountain bike type derailleur for good shifting, because of the range of gears"
3,Good Cassette,"Good cassette, nothing out of the ordinary. Does the job. Not quite as good as Shimano cassettes, but couldn't get the size I wanted."
3,Lock Ring Not Included,"Came to me and the smallest gears were lost in the back of the box and the lock ring was nowhere to be found. Was able to pick one up at a bike shop, but was disappointed I had to make that extra stop."
5,Good Quality Cassette,"Replaced my Sunrace 12-25 in my Trek 1.1 with this. I also replaced the chain with sram 850 at the same time. It is definetely a better cassette, lighter and gear changes are smoother. I have a simillar cassette in my trek 7.2 and always notice the difference between the sram cassette and the sunrace. Sram is much smoother."
3,banged up but works well,"This item was not shipped in a box, it was packed in a heat sealed envelope and as a result it was banged up on all corners and the spine. It still works well as a binder but as a portfolio representing quality work it would totally send the wrong message."
