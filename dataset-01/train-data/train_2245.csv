4,"good price, book in good condition","only concern was that it arrived later than expected, yet still in time for me to use it. was overall satisfied with the order"
1,Learn Latin America,Very good book. It gives us a real idea of what was and is Latin America (since the enviroment is very much dinamic the last/last issues are not incorpoated in the book). Worth!
4,Great Job in Review,"Skidmore and Smith deliver a great historical review of the development of Latin America covering the span between the precolonial period and present time. These authors further engage in individualized analysis of some countries, though leave out some with great historic importance, like Bolivia. Overall however, this book serves as an outstanding reference guide to those interested in Latin American Studies."
3,Packed with Info... Lacking in Intrigue,"In my college going career, I have never crossed a book written by someone that is clearly so knowledgeable... unfortunately, the author is also so incredibly boring that I can't believe that they've read their own book. This one is a snoozer and I struggle to get through it."
5,great,"I have used and bought this item before. I got it for the price and it was great. all this taste so, so, but they do work. Just have to get passed the taste or get used to it."
4,great!,Great for pre-workout drink and getting you energized for a full and complete overall workout at the gym to give you the boost!
3,works but disgusting taste,ill have to say this stuff looks like something that would come out of the sewer system. taste about the same. i have used the fruit punch and blue flavor of no xplode and would highly recommend you stay with those flavors. I dont know who decided that this taste anything like lemon lime but i think they need to hire someone else for this is gross and no where near the flavor of any lemon lime product i have ever had
2,tastes horrible and only partly works,not the pumps described even though i tried everything else. I found that taking whey protein isolate at 200grams per day worked better at giving me a pump during my workouts.
5,Awesome and scary,This is a marvelous story of our efforts over the last 65+ years with very awe inspiring ptctures but scary as hell because we rarely knew what thety were doing to our planet.+
3,A History of Mount Peel Station (New Zealand High Country),"Mount Peel is a hundred, the story of the first high country sheep station in Canterbury. 1956, printed at the Herald Printing Works, Timaru, NZ. 83 pages.Contents:1. In the beginning2. West, the land is bright3. Settling Mt Peel4. Pioneering Days5. Thru the years6. From depression to prosperity7. The Acland Family8. The men who worked on Peel9. The Homestead and church10. Two strange Tales11. No answer to the snows12. Search for gold13. Men of faith."
3,Bad Remake,"This movie is a remake of the original 2 hour pilot which I knew that before I bought it. I am a big SG-1 fan and wanted to add this to my collection. It had scenes that were originally cut from the show(most for good reason) but they removed a scene or two for every one they added. I think it is shorter then the original too. It is worth seeing for the additional footage but not for the $20 I paid for it. If you can get it cheap, then pick it up but don't expect a great show."
4,Glad this was available.,So they put this up on AIV with all the seasons. I start watching Season 1. The first two episodes are a two parter but the second part is not available. Amazon says 'It is not us that decides the episodes that are available'. Very lame. Glad this redo of the first two episodes was available.
5,My problem was solved!,What a great product! I needed a way to have my TV play through my hot tub stereo speakers so we could hear our TV on the porch while we were in the hot tub. Sounds great with very minimal hum. I am very impressed with the $71 I spent on it.
4,easy to install - works as advertised,"Got it in the mail and had it up and running in about 15 minutes...dummy-proof...sound transmission quality is very good...was suprised how much bass came through.,..all in all...seems a bit overpriced for what it is, but it does what I need so go for it!"
4,Whole House Music At A Bargain,"I have been using this FM transmitter for a little over 2 years and remain very pleased with it. I originally turned it on only during the day to enhance transmitter longevity, but eventually have left it on 24/7 in the past year without any apparent adverse effect. It sent a weaker signal to the farthest room (approx 60 ft away from the transmitter) in our single level home; however, when I used our Philips clock/ipod/radio (DC290B/37)w/c has an external FM antenna and a definitely stronger signal pick-up than most table radios I've owned, the reception was near perfect. Needless to say, we've been enjoying whole house music from our central source at a small fraction of the usual cost of a whole house system. BTW, the staff at Whole House FM were tremendous: I missed their time-limited promotion by 2 days, but they gave me the promotional price (almost 40% off) anyway.The item arrived 3 days after order date."
1,Dissapointed,Very Dissapointed in this product. Gets a lot of hiss and interference on all frequencies and only works at all from within 10 feet or so.
2,Be careful,"I ordered this unit and tried all of the dip-switch combinations to vary the frequency, but was unable to get any of the frequencies to result in a clear signal. I live in a large city, and either other stations would drown out the signal coming from this unit or it gave a very low signal-to-noise ratio - reminded me of a crystal radio. I know others have said that it works great, but it did not work for me.Also be aware that the seller has a 30-day return policy that is strictly enforced. I wish I would have known that earlier. I got the unit during a period when work was very busy and didn't try it until it was too late."
4,"Expensive, but probably the best you'll get","Firstly, if you're not planning on using this product with batteries, then you're going to get a humming sound in the background. If you use batteries, then there's no interference.The transmission power is good, as stated.This product is expensive ($USD90). I bought a similar product, of lower quality, in Hong Kong for about HKD30 (~USD4), and it did the job, except that it would occasionally just turn off if it was knocked. Power output was OK. But I wanted something that was reliable. This prodcut, so far, is.Read the other reviews. Accept the fact that you're never going to get perfect transmission. Use batteries. If you want the best FM transmitter and acknowledge that none of them are perfect, then wear the cost and get this one."
1,Get the C.Crane FMT,"I purchased the ""C. Crane FMT"" and the ""Whole House FM Transmitter -Gold Edition"" for a two story 7,000 sq ft house to be connected to Sirius and an Ipod. The C. Crane FMT ROCKzzzz. The ""Whole House FM Transmitter -Gold Edition"" BLOWS. I used them in the same application, the Crane FMT needed the pot adjusted and then it covered the entire house... floor to floor. I connected the extender to the ""Whole House"" and still couldn't get it to stop dropping out, it is located about 20 feet from the receiver.C. Crane FMT is the way to go."
5,Nice Device,"The other positive comments for this product are accurate. This little box beams your audio all over your house. While there is some degredation of signal, this is reasonable to expect. Much easier than running speaker wires all over your house."
1,Weak,"I have been very disappointed with this product. From the start I have only been able to get the weakest signal. I called and they suggested ""putting it in a higher location"" and told me I could extend the antenna - it is just a wire, if it needs to be longer why doesn't it come that way? Even with the radio in the same room it is weak. They said that it doesn't work well with radios that don't have digital tuning - like most of the clock radios and boom boxes in my house! Also they said that often it doesn't work in bigger cities - too much interference. They should really put that on the website. And now, after a few months, I get nothing - seems to not work at all anymore."
3,Included RCA to 3.5mm adapter is MONO only,"I recently purchased the Whole House FM Transmitter direct from the company. It works great and I would give it 5 stars, except for one key cable that comes in the box: the cable to plug the transmitter to a L/R RCA output converts the audio to MONO! The transmitter and 3.5mm output work great in stereo, but the RCA adapter, which has a required volume control, makes both speakers play the combined sound. I contacted support from their website. They responded promptly, but informed me that my cable was working the way it was intended. I do recommend you buy this product, but you will absolutely want to go directly to Radio Shack and buy a stereo-RCA-to-3.5mm cable adapter $7.95 and an inline-volume control $7.99 (Radio Shack part #42-2559) to make it work properly."
1,Don't buy.,"I purchased this item thinking that I was going to get a good reception if I did what they explained to do. I get a lousy signal, and I done everyting that the instructions said to do."
1,Do not purchase this,This company is currently under investigation by the FCC because it is not properly certified and may be illegally overpowered.
5,Mythic Consciousness,"The 1995 edition of the brilliant work, ""Tracking the Gods: The Place of Myth in Modern Life"" is absolutely ""a must be read"" by all those who are interested in ""Myth"" and the importance of the mythological awareness, values, and meaning in the ""divided world"" today! James Hollis, the author, provided powerful stimuli for a quite necessary dialogue and awareness within our mind and thought regarding myth, image, divine mind, mythic consciousness, and the concept of ""God-image."" He also deeply and wisely illustrates ""how myths reflect the archetypal roots of our personal psychology, and explains how ancient drives influence and often dominate our behavior."" I strongly believe that this book on myth, God-image and values is a valuable mythic reference for all of us today."
3,interesting but slow paced,"This was a good book it told about what went wrong the night the japanese shot torpedoes at the U.S.S. Indianapolis, and some of the trials some of the crew members had to deal with like sharks, lack of food, and no floatation devices. It was a slow read I had to read each sentence a couple of times to process what was happening. I would recommend this book, but only to people that would like to learn more about this accident. Many people were harmed and killed during this accident so it is definately not something to take lightly. In the end none of the crew members belived it was the captains fault the whole incedent happened. Thanks to the help of Hunter Scott this was made possible!"
4,Interesting Read. Enjoyable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"From start to finish I enjoyed much of this novel. THere were times when i didn't understand all of the fancy language of the navy and ships, but it was a great read.THis novel is based on the story of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. THis ship sinks during the world war and everyone points their fingers at the captain. But a young boy chooses to aid this man who has been accused of this nonsense.This book is very interesting and every page had more detail and suspense that made it a great read. Usually I can't sit throughan entire book but i got through this one. I reccomend it toaanyone interested in suspense and tension. THis book is for you."
2,Huh?,"I can understand why some thought this book inspirational. The plot line had the potential to be very interesting and a great thing to read about. However,( no offense to other reviewers) the author managed to make it so. boring. I read it as a book club book for our county schools and it took me three times as long to read it as most other books! He just droned on and on about random statistics about the ship blah blah blah.... Every few chapters we would hear from the men actually on the ship. That was quite interesting. Everything else I found tedious and boring. Therefore, I advise others NOT TO READ THIS BOOK. GO DO SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING. LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY. If you really REALLY REALLY like boats and the military ( i mean really really REALLY like it) then go ahead and buy it. But its not really good for a wide audience."
5,Fascinating story on many levels,"I came across this book when looking for something for 6th graders to read. It looked exciting, and has the added interest of being motivated by a 6th grader's history fair project. The book itself hops back and forth between an ""as if you were there"" accounting of the events that led to and the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, and the story of Hunter Scott's efforts to have Captain McVay's name cleared. For me, it really worked. The parts from the past were riveting, as the men endured five horrible days in and on the sea. The parts from the present (fewer in length and number) also kept me interested. The map and photographs added a lot to my reading experiece as well. I think this would be a great choice for a teen reader looking for something substantial but exciting."
1,Horrible quality,"They advertise the necklace as being appraised, however, in a response to the complaint I sent the company replied:""Please understand that original appraisals from certified appraisers cost between $120 to $150 each in nationwide market. Thus we are not able to send the original appraisals along the order. The copy of the appraisal is for reference purposes only.""Obviously each individual necklace is not appraised, and the company sends a copy of an appraisal for a similar necklace. The appraisal itself refers to a particular necklace, not a group of necklaces. There is no guarantee that the necklace you receive has actually been appraised at all.The reason I am writing this is because I received a horrible quality necklace with many pits and a very dull luster. It is frustrating to me that the company thinks it is okay to present something as being actually appraised when it in fact has not been."
5,Excellent for beginners,"This book is excellent if you have no experience with writing to a windowing platform. It is good to have a grasp on C and basic coding experience. The book is well written and gives many examples along with warning tips, common pitfalls and known bugs. The chapters flow from one to another much like a school text book. I recommend this book highly if you want to learn OS2 programming in C."
3,Sweet movie,"It was a cute movie, but not anything as expected after reading the comments before purchase. TOTALLY unrealistic as far as the family and friends etc... Hollywood's version of reaction to cancer. Cancer,ben there done that, and am still. No matter the family dynamic,family ALWAYS steps up first. The friends part is true. They either are there for the long haul or abandon you due to their own issues. Would have to rate this as 2 1/2."
3,Not a Feel Good Movie,"The acting seemed fine, but the overall mood of the film seemed morose and lackluster. Not the kind of movie that I would wish to see again."
2,Certainly not a Rom-Com,"The movie is very slow. How the heaven and three wishes thing works, just doesn't fit well into the film. The romance doesn't work. I really expected to like this. My husband and three teenagers watched it with me, and all five of us were very disappointed. It's as if a melodrama, rom-com, and fantasy comedy were all on the drawing board, and the result was a mish-mash of nothing."
2,"Terrible Movie, Good Sevice","For fans of the romance genre ""A Little Bit of Heaven"" will seem poorly scripted with some mild high points. The acting for the most part is just mailed in, which is disappointing when you consider Kathy Bates is in this film. The plot is full of clichès and tries to be serious but fails in a laughable way. The comedic sections of the movie are not bad but still not worth money. The high points of this film are Whoopie Goldberg as God and a scene that involves the title phrase, which I will not spoil as it was the only scene really worth watching. As For Amazon's VOD service...couldn't be better."
2,A Little Bit of Heaven,"While I usually enjoy Kate Hudson movies, I wasn't impressed with this one. I didn't like the theme of ""party girl gets sick"". I also wasn't impressed by her Co-star's acting ability."
1,It is NOT a comedy!,"It is not a comedy! It is even not a melodrama - it is tragegy! I was surprise by performance of Hadson and the story itself, but also I was disappointed by misleading- when person is dying it difficult to laugh!"
4,Heartfelt & moving,"This movie is a little deeper than the typical romantic comedy Kate Hudson normally stars in, although not by much. It was a good, heartfelt love story with comedy throughout. A chick flick for sure, but one that guys can appreciate and not be completely bored with."
5,Kate Hudson's BEST Role Ever!,"Wow! All I can say is that all the negative reviews must be trolls. What has humanity sunk to when people can make some of the negative comments they have, unless they have ulterior motives that are completely unrelated to film appreciation?Story = great!Scripting = great!Acting = great!A very moving movie, touching some of the rawest emotions people face."
5,Amazing and Emotional Movie,"One of the most surprising movies she has been in, great love story and great story that is very realistic of people who have cancer and what they go thru...very heart touching!"
1,Terrible,Terrible movie. Character didnt learn anything. Kept treating people like crap. continued to do things her way without a thought and everything was ok. Unrealistic. This is more worldly without real love invovled. Treat people like crap and get love for it is really stupid.
4,Great movie,"Not too mushy, a bit silly with great plot. Id definitely watch again. Why hadn't I heard of this movie?"
5,amazing!,"this movie was so true to life! I've lost several family members and friends, and this emotional movie had the variety of ups and downs. But most importantly making you laugh, cry, and enjoy every remaining moment you have left!"
4,"Very Good, Chic Flic","Very good movie. Modern ""terms of endearment"". Single, powerful, self sustaining women, not looking for love but love finds her. Love Kate Hudson and her simplicity."
4,A Little Bit of Heaven,Funny and sad.....a rollercoaster of feelings.....laughed and cried....it captures the wide range of human emotions when dealing with life and with death. Good movie.
1,Heinous,"It wasn't even a GOOD story ... I almost turned it off 3 times because it was so awful/cheesy/boring/predictable ... but I was watching with friends, so we agreed to suffer through it together. In the end, we also agreed it wasn't worth it. Wish I could get my rental fee back!"
1,Skip it,Worst movie ever. Seriously. Don't waste your time. Depressing and ridiculously awful. You will have to watch another movie just to erase this one from your memory. Can't imagine what would possess Kate Hudson to do this.
1,this doesnt work on my dvd player i will be returning it,why doesnt this dvd work on my dvd player? it says its not in the right area? im very disappointed in this purchase
5,A little bit of heaven,"Dvd arrived in great shape for having been previously viewed. The DVD was set for region 2, however with the help of my computer I was able to change the setting."
5,Proper Perspective,"The Australian professor, previously unknown to me, has presented what appealed to me as a fresh perspective on the Watchmaker. It is the author's hope to attract readers to another pathway than ""the arid desert of naturalism."" The book challenged my own thinking."
1,Sheer Idiocy,"This book is unconvincing and childish. It's amazing to me that Broom believes himself to be a scientist. This book is a flailing attempt to discredit a theory that the author doesn't appear even to understand. It will convince only those who already deny evolution, and even many of them may be turned off by the weak arguments contained herein. Dumb."
5,Probably the best sled video currently out there,"The riding is solid as is the soundtrack and editing. If you can only own one sled video, this is probably the one you want. I cannot wait until I see the Slednecks 5 this fall!"
1,Wish I hadn't purchased,"I received this item via Super Saver shipping. Took 10 days to receive.Immediately, I filled with air and intended on using it later that night.8 hours later, it was nearly flat. No one had used it yet.I reinflated it and made sure all fill plugs were tightly sealed.Same thing happened again.Called Amazon for a return label and good riddance!This has to be the worst air mattress you can buy!"
3,Confused,"I am unsure how to order this shoe, your add is conflicting. I want the Tampa bay rays not the bucs. Your description goes both ways as well. The shoe picture is the rays emblem but advertised as bucs. I would like to order the TB shoe, but do not know how to contact you to insure I get the proper order."
2,Not all the information. Read before purchase.,"I purchased this bumper for a 2001 Yamaha Raptor. I got the bumper and thought it looked decent. Tubing is thin but ok. The issue I have, is when I got the bumper, it did not include installation instructions. It had a paper that said in order to install you need to purchase an additional bracket kit... Here is the website where you can purchase it. Very upsetting. No where on the description or informaion about the product did it detail that it needed the additional Brackets. So here I am a month later still waiting for the brackets to show up to install the bumper..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"IT IS ONLY 26% PROTEIN.The following is from a Nature's Best customer service representative:It is 131.96 calories per scoop. Additional information is below: Milk, Egg Whites, 1.168lbs is egg of the 25lbs Here is the information on the product: Our Classic Milk & Egg Protein consists of Whey Protein Concentrate, Whole Milk Powder, Egg White Powder, Pure Crystalline Fructose and Vanilla Flavor.

4,When innocence is lost,"I like Keri Russell, she good......enjoyed the movie, well put together. I know it hard to get movie with good ending"
2,I whish I'd received written conformation!,I paid for it and got an e-mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation. Called the 1800#. It's been a month. If it's this hard to get the plan I wonder how it will be if I need to replace my product.
1,Replacement Plans,"The plan came as promised, but the item that it covers is listed nowhere on the contract. If I needed to replace the item, would the contract cover it?"
3,"Have not had to use it yet, but will probably need it on a projector","Most projectors fail within a few years, this is a no brainer in my Opinion."
4,Never thought i'd use it,"was a good purchase since the product i purchased is defective, I'm out what i payed for this and shipping to the manufacturer. So pretty much it's like a %15 restocking fee."
2,"Released in 2005, Reference for PMBOK 2000","As I was looking for an updated book to study form my PMP certification, I bought this one. I thought it was updated with PMBOK 2004 reference. In fact, the authors say there is a new version of the PMBOK (2004 one), but it is dedicated for those who want to study for the PMBOK 2000 examination. I did not look well the material as I returned the item without using it. Probably it could be good for those who are studying the 2000 examination (it ends on september 2005), but as we have a reference PMBOK from 2004 I suppose a book released in 2005 should be updated with this reference."
2,Useful-ish,"This guide is basically a PM-BOK-lite. It is a good framework for studying but doesn't provide useful elaborations. Once you have worked your way through the PMBOK, switching to this book will make it more wieldy. Cetainly wouldn't spend the money on a new copy. The questions are poorly written and I've found a few that are just plain wrong."
2,false description,"Very good reference with examples, formulas, etc.BUT (capital BUT): It is written for the PMBOK version 2000, not version 3.The answers given to the sample exam questions are not in line with the PMBOK version 3, nor are some of the chaptersIt is still a good reference to understand the notions, but don't use to learn the key processes.The authors should updated it ! It would then be a great studying tool."
5,Fabulous CD!,"I was lucky enought to stumble on this CD and WOW it is fantastic. I'd forgotten what great songs the BeeGees put out. My teen years floated though my mind as I enjoyed listening to these songs over and over. I especially enjoyed ""Man in the Middle"" the tribute to brother Maurice Gibb. Great album!"
1,How many compilation of the same stuffs do we need?,"Don't get me wrong, I like the Bee Gees. But this one is just another compilation of the materials readily available. I bought it for the DVD (what a way to get people like me), and found out that the quality of the video and sound on the DVD is very very VERY lousy. Why not release ""Bunbury Tale"", ""Hawk"" soundtrack and some rare stuffs if they (I am not sure who they are) want to make some money?Disappointed."
5,Great deal!,"The BeeGees are my favorite group from the past. This is a wonderful album with almost all of their good songs. Takes me back to the 70s, and the deal was wonderful. I couldn't pass it up, even if I have almost all of their songs."
4,"Missing the #2's and #3's, etc.","This collection seems to shoot for the casual fan and fanatic at the same time. The DVD, which you might watch twice, is pretty much for the biggest of fans, while the CD is your basic single disc hits album. I often wonder why bands limit themselves to the #1 songs, but I guess that happens when you already have numerous ""Greatest Hits"" and ""Best Ofs"" out there. Anyway, there's no doubt these are all great songs, and I can't imagine how anyone could not like The Bee Gees. Of course there's alot missing here, and if you feel the same way, pick up the 2-disc ""The Record"" instead. It's twice as good."
4,All their best,A good mix of their early hits and their more popular hits too. Perfect for old fans and new ones alike.
3,Purchased for someone else,"I liked that it had so many ""hits"" on it.I would recommend this to Bee Gee lovers.Compared to other other CDs it was more bang for your buck"
2,Poor sound quality,I thought these were all Bee Gees hits not them singing others hits and should have done more research. I would like to get my money back if possible so I can buy a Bee Gees I like.
3,i don't speak anything but english,all of the programs are not in english must have a word guide some where that will let me know which song title is playing
3,Great deal,"Not a huge fan but almost everyone has one or two songs by these guys that you can't help but like. Maybe I was thinking of all the tragedies the family has been through but it seemed as though there a certain level of sadness, or melancholy, throughout the CD that I didn't expect."
5,Great album,What a great album. Great price @ .99 cents. All the great hits they are known for! Love to listen to while driving on the road traveling.
5,I LOVE IT!,I JUST GOT THE BEE GEES NUMBER 1 HITS CD YESTERDAY I LOVE IT THE SOUND IS FRESH ON IT ALSO I LIKE THE BONUS DVD WITH IT IT WAS GREAT!IT WAS NICE OF BARRY & ROBIN TO THINK OF MAURICE I WAS HAPPY & SAD AT THE SAME TIME!FROM A BIG BEE GEES & ROBIN GIBB FAN KIRSTEN
2,Number Ones-The Bee Gees,"Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector. The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable. Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off. Even Robin's latest redition ""A Live CD"" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies. And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family. Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers. So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.A devoted listener talisman, Dundee"
1,Amazon mp3 downloader fail,"This may be the greatest album ever, but I would not know because the Amazon mp3 downloader simply would not work. From the first attempt I was forced to reinstall the downloader and again for 13 subsequent attempts - even including working with Amazon tech support, I could never get the music on my box.This was several weeks ago and despite assurances from Amazon I have never been notified of a correction.I used to love Amazon mp3 music. I have probably downloaded in excess of 50 albums. Unfortunately the download software has become bugging and not reliable. It is a shame because Amazon has a great library to choose from and relatively fair pricing."
4,"Decent Pop, Awesome Disco","The pre-Saturday Night Fever stuff hasn't aged so well - mainly due to the production. Things liven up a lot once you get to ""How Deep Is Your Love."" ""You Win Again"" was a hit everywhere but the U.S., and I still can't figure that one out. A very good summation..."
5,Joey Deck !,"This is a great over all deck.It has good magic,trap,and monsters.A good way to build your deck is to get all the starter decks and two of each boster pack and...IT'S TIME TO DUEL!!!"
5,STARTER DECK JOEY IS THE BEST STARTER DECK EVER!!!!!!!,"the starter deck joey is off the hook. Ya know ya get a RED EYES BLACK DRAGON!!! Now THAT""S WHAT IM TALKING BOUT BABY!! YOU HAVE TO GET A STARTER DECK JOEY. IF YA DONT WANT TO GET IT THAT IS FINE BUT YOU ARE MISSING OUT OF A SUPREME DEAL!!"
5,Great gift idea,"Yu-Gi-Oh is a new card game that is a hit with kids of all ages,and this is a great way to start a duelest off. First of all you get 40 cards 3 holographic, a playing mat,and a guide on how to play.You and your child will spend hours playing with each other.The only problem is that you have to buy an other deck if you want to play too. If your child is having problems in math this is a fun solution.When you get the hang of it buy some boster packs to get more and sometimes better cards to add to your deck,There are 8 to chose from all with diffrent cards.I recommend yu-gi-oh an ihope you consider having it on your list of gifts this year."
5,Loads of fun!,"This deck (Joey) is one of the best. Your good magic and Trap cards include: Dark Hole, Dian Keto the Cure Master, Shield and Sword, Monster Reborn, Dragon Treasure, De-Spell, Trap Hole, Fissure, Change of Heart and my favorite POLYMERIZATION! But the monster cards are not as strong as I thought. I excpect Black Skull Dragon. But here are some good ones: Red Eyes Black Dragon, Time Wizard, Penguin Soldier, Harpie's Brother, Island Turtle, Magician of Faith, Spirit of the Harp, Baby Dragon (my favorite) and 7 Colored Fish. The two fusion monsters are Flame Swordsman (Flame Manipulator + Maskai the Ledgendary Swordsman) and Thousand Dragon (Baby Dragon + Time Wizard). That's why I love Baby Dragon. So get up and by a Joey Starter deck!"
5,joeys starter deck,joeys starter deack is soooo cool you get even the rarest cards like polymirization and red eyes black dragon and every thing so get it now before it's too late

4,For starters this is a good deck,I really like this deck. It's the best because you can get monsters on the field easier. There is only 1 monster with the highest stars and that's the powerful Red Eyes Black Dragon Level 7. So I think this is the best deck.
1,This toy = bad,Thees carks cusk. Yugioh!! is goood BUT THE STARTERSS^E( ARee bad I hatee tehm! teh STarDERsa re bad!!!11!11!!!111!1! Blu I's is the ony goob cark.
1,:(,I WAS HOPING TO GET A SAMMY SOSA ROOKIE CARD BUT ALL I GOT WAS A BUNCH OF DUMB DRAWINGS ON MY CARDS. I MUST CRY NOW.
3,Controversial,"I know a lot of the other(younger) reviewers will tell you how great this is however i feel that it is seriously missing some cards. for example the only cards a serious player will use is maha valio, gearfried and harpies brother thats it!"
5,awsome,this was an awsome deck it had alot of stratagies such as fusing baby dragon and time wizard together to make thousand dragon and use magician of faith to get your polermerization back and fuse two more cards to get flame swordsman and a lot more and best of all it comes wit da Red Eyes Black Dragon and if you are really good you can make your red eyes get up to 3700 atk points.
2,Last Choice of the current starter decks.,The monsters are all lame and the magic and spell can be found in the other decks which also include beter monster cards. I suggest getting the Yugi deck for your learners deck and then work your way from there if you buy another deck go with Kaiba unless you want a bunch of toon monsters. You can then start to customize your deck with boosters and eventually when you have lots of spare cards you may want to get a tin they come with the card pictured on front and 5 booster packs and are a good place to store your spare cards.
3,I'm glad I got the first edition.,This all started when I watched the TV show and became hooked. Then I just wanted to start collecting yu-gi-oh!This box contains the three holographic cards:Red eye's black dragonScapegoatPenguin soldier
2,Shop Manual doesn't get very technical,"I paid a lot more for this manual at a tractor supply store than what it is offer for here.I was having electrical problems and needed a schematic, and instructions on how to replace the points.This manual had no schematic for the 9N and didn't give any insight as to how to get to the inaccessable points. ""nseries.com"" had all the info I needed."
2,Same old story,"It is amazing that Koo Koo Boy's music is still being recycled. I do need to say that Scott Coblio has a tremendous voice and a lyrical gift. I saw Koo Koo Boy many times in Rocester in the early 1990's and loved the energy and sound, but it has worn thin. The age of ""shock"" really has passed, no matter what. The whole ""shock"" fad is old, and in all honesty, just watch MTV or BET...there is not much shocking anymore of a person jumping on stage in their underware..it is a common occurance. Scott Coblio still appears that he is still trying to piss off his old man or cause an elderly person to have a heart attack by his appearance or antics. Revitalize the image please. I would love to hear new, fresh material. Perhaps Koo Koo Boy can go further than being popular in central New York."
3,Received wrong item by same name,I was thinking I was ordering another DVD by the same name and got this instead. It should have been more clear as this was not the TV series. I did not even view it. It went straight in the trash. It did not get one star just because it was as pictured.
4,Nice gift,"Much nicer quality than the other multi-pack receiving blankets I've got: they're a little more expensive so maybe you'd expect that, but I've found that doesn't always mean anything. They came out of the laundry looking the same as they went in with no loss of softness or color. They're still a little skimpy but I've yet to find a lower-priced receiving blanket that isn't. I'm more hopeful that these will stand up better to the wear and tear I'm expecting them to get than the other brands."
1,"Ripoff, pure and simple","""Equator"" is an entertaining six-part series that aired on television (HD Theater) several times since 2006. It's being released on individual DVD's at $20 a pop, making this by far the most expensive nature series ever offered on amazon.com.This ridiculous packaging policy is an affront to purchasers. My advice is to wait and buy the entire set for a reasonable price when it shows up on ebay or through amazon's resale vendors."
2,Neat Philippino Flick; Not-so Neat DVD Presentation,"I grew up with the Philippino horror flicks (particularly the ""blood trilogy"") on cable TV in the 70's and was happy to see it available (at a budget price to boot) by Retromedia, but I have to agree with the previous reviewers with the headache-inducing ""print"" (probably from an old vhs tape, judging by the bleeding colors and lack of detail) that Retromedia used for the DVD. However, the same movie is available on DVD from Image Entertainment under the title of ""Blood Of The Vampires"" (from ""the blood collection"" series) that's vastly superior in terms of picture quality and special features (audio commentary track by Sam Sherman, video interview with Eddie Romero, still gallery, etc.) If you're a fan of Philippino horror (as I am), you won't be dissappointed.I'm sure Fred Olen Ray had good intentions releasing this disc, but it's not worth your valuable time and money. Stick to the Image DVD.Peace!"
2,Coulda been better...,"I saw this movie by way of CINEMATIC TITANIC and the way they riff on it,it's pretty funny.This has the look and feel of a good vampire movie,but what ruins it is that you have Filipino actors pretending to be Mexican.Filipino actors in black face.Bad dubbing.Why does the lead actor(Eddie Garcia,I think)let his mom(who is a vampire in the basement)bite him on the neck?? How come you can see his reflection in the mirror when he's a vampire?? How come the vampires don't fly away towards the end when the castle is burning?? There are probably more questions to ask,but I think you get the point.All in all,kind of entertaining in a cheesy way,but don't you expect something a little bit more out of your Filpino vampire movies??Well,maybe not.."
5,Terrific entertainment. Keri Russell is gorgeous!!,"Anyone who bought this movie thinking it was porn, needs to go back to school and learn how to read (and probably how to put half a thought together). If I were those two losers, I'd be ashamed to admit I was stupid enough to think this cast would be involved in a porn movie. Get your minds out of the cellar, boys! Oh, I forgot, you weren't blessed with brains. For your information, this movie has already become a cult favorite for those in the know.The Babysitter's Seduction is fun Friday night entertainment. Keri Russell is absolutely gorgeous and a darn good actress, especially considering she was only 17 or 18 when the movie was filmed.Take off your shoes, make yourself a bowl of popcorn, curl up on the couch and prepare to lose yourself in a really good movie. I especially enjoyed the non-stop action-packed ending. This one is going to become a classic!"
3,One of Keri Russell's first made for TV movies...,"not a GREAT movie, but its not bad either. If you like Keri Russell you should see it just cause she's cool to see in any movie. If not, you have a 50/50 chance of liking it. Other Keri movies to check out: The Curve, Eight Days a Week, Mad About Mambo, Honey I Blew Up the Kid (haha) and of course you can watch Felicity on the WB..."
1,Worst jewelry book I have ever seen,"I have about 40 books on jewelry and this is the absolute worst one I have ever seen.........what a waste of money! Half of the pictures are so out of focus that you cannot see any details on the jewelry, most pictures are in black and white, there are no dates, and any information in this book you can find in almost any other book on costume jewelry. I wouldn't advise that anyone, even beginners to collecting, spend their money on this book.........there are too many good books on the subject! Buy any other book rather than this one."
1,Costume Jewelry Variations: A Collector's Identification and Price Guide (Paperback),I echo the previous review. I bought the book last year and was very disappointed. I felt as if I got ripped off. The quality of the book was poor. Images were bad and blurry & black and white. There is no rhyme or reason for the book to even be printed. It did not add anything to the information out there on costume jewelry. Save your money.
4,Another Great 60's Band From Texas,"I really like this disc. Strong songs from start to finish, and talented musicianship. The vocals, while similar to Roky Erikson, shouldn't tempt you to dismiss this band as imitaters of the 13th Floor Elevators, though if you like them, you should like the Golden Dawn. The music kicks butt, and has the vibe of partying away a summer day, circa 1968. This album is a real blast of fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes Nuggets and 60's garage rock, though this hits above garage rock in places."
1,Stay away from this recording!,"The sound quality on this release is horrendous! The sound level is uneven from track to track. Most are clearly taken from vinyl, as you can clearly hear the pops and ticks! Too further add insult, the majority of these recordings are instrumental. While the music itself is pure 60's go-go, it can hardly be promoted as Andre Williams - if he appears nowhere on it! One would do better to purchase the release - Movin On: Greasy and Explicit Soul Movers 1956-1970 offered here: http://www.amazon.com/Movin-Greasy-Explicit-Movers-1956-1970/dp/B000ICMH0Q/ref=pd_sim_m_2"
5,"Really should be printed again, great book","It was a small island on the edge of the most massive empire the world would ever see.Coated with mist and covered with the magic of the druids.The many tribes fought constantly, and a mans honor was valued by the strength of his sword.Even woman were honored by the blood they had spilled in Battle.Then Rome turned its eye towards them.They never stood a chance.This is the a story of three people, brave, devoted and strong who fought for a cause they knew was hopeless from the start. They gave all they had, gambled all they knew and dedicated their whole lives to a simple ideal: freedom.This is beautifully written, even moving at times. Pauline Gedge is a wonderful writer, and this should be published again.If you like this also read The Light Bearer by Donna Gillespie.Five stars."
4,A novel of Boudicca,"If you've never encountered Boudicca in history, then you may want to do yourself a favor a pick this book up. Like Manda Scott (and soon Margaret George), Pauline Gedge has chosen one of the most famous female leaders of all time and given her a novel. I really enjoyed learning about Iceni culture, about how Boudicca tried to triumph against the invading Romans, and what life was like several thousand years ago in Britain. I really enjoyed this book, as well as Manda Scott's. I'm looking forward to Margaret George's take on this as well."
3,Just all right,"I feel really badly about not likely this book as much as all of the other reviewers clearly did. I had read Manda Scott's take on Boudica a while back,. and I remember her books with great detail and fondness. I figured I would be in for another pleasant read with this novel about Boudica, but I found myself disappointed. The writing is just okay, the descriptions seem mediocre, and the only high point for me was the history. But history alone can't carry a book, and I found my attention constantly wandering to other things like my laundry, my dishes, my chores. Not a good sign.While this book wasn't terrible - far from it - I wasn't carried away either. For me, it was just all right."
2,British goods,Nice pot. However the outside glaze cracked while on a tealiteYes a prepped it with hot water firstStill works fine
1,Who is G.S. Maiden,"If this is Gregory Scott Maiden who works for Tampa Educational Cable Consortium, why would you be giving a review on your own DVD?"
5,Not Just for the Kids,"We purchased Steve's CD, Spinning Tales and our 3 year old makes us bring it along in the car wherever we go. Check out these tunes and you'll be singing them everywhere too. Steve's lyrics and music are very catchy. We've also seen him live in concert and people can't help but getting into the ""Beans Band"" music. You too will have ""impatient feet"" listening to his music. Highly recommended music for the whole family. Buy this CD, even if you don't have children!"
1,Damaged During Shipping,"I ordered two of these refrigerators (one by mistake--wrong shipping address), and both arrived very damaged. Do not order this refrigerator from Amazon. There is no padding at all in the packaging, so the product will arrive dented, scratched and otherwise damaged."
2,"missing parts, poorly packed, arrived damaged","The fridge arrived in a cardboard box with no packing materials protecting it. It had several large dents from shipping. Worse, it was missing one of the screws that hold the bottom hinge assembly in place, preventing the door from opening and closing normally. The hole itself was stripped, so I couldn't even replace the screw. I had to epoxy the assembly in place to keep the hinge aligned properly."
5,Met all my expectations,My husband and I bought this fridge as a surprise for our teenaged son. It holds quite a bit and have no complaints.
3,A post-contemporary folk tale of man vs machine.,"Steeldriver is a contemporized version of the classic ""man vs. machine"" struggles common at the introduction of the Industrial Revolution. Jon Hundred must burrow through an enormous mountain before his computer adversary in order to win a wager. However, his own past and compassion catches up with him. Debrandt creates an effective tale, without the usual stereotypical branding found in the neo-folk tale (i.e., the ""evil"", soulless AI isn't played that way at all). He means to make a story that is supposed to stand out as archtypal for the time, with his larger than life Jon Hundred and MEL characters. Unfortunately though, the characters end up a bit too idealized, and you'll probably cringe through the ending (which I won't reveal here). However, if you like this sort of neo-frontier setting you should check out the (in my opinion) definitive work on the topic Mike Resnick's ""Santiago"""
5,as good as it gets,"I agree with the other reviewer here. I have a few of these ""As Good As It Gets"" compilations and they are all right on the money. This one has a lot of great stuff that you really never get to hear too much. Great artists, great songs, good recordings, and it only costs eleven bucks! Even liner notes! The dates on the songs here range from 1937-1948, most are from the late 40's and they are post-war jump blues, straight blues and boogie woogie."
2,Not a Great Book,"After reading the book, I read all of the reviews below. This book isn't as bad as the worst critics make it out to be, but it's not as good as the apologists purport. It's just another read. If you get assigned it for a feminist class, relax, read it, and move on. It's a strange book because it's not really about Bosnia - not having much to offer about politics or the war. It's not about sexual politics - being just another feminist screed. But it's mostly about the writer's own personal thoughts on rape as a military tool. If that interests you, you'll enjoy the book. If not, you probably won't be able to finish it."
1,Where is the Book ?,"I tried to read book, I read first half, but writer only talk about himself. Where is the book? Why does writer not talk about Bosnia? Who cares about writer? I did not intend to buy her biography. This book is useless."
1,Drivel,"This is a dreadful book. Didn't the writer do ANY research on Bosnia? When I got to the part where she said that describing the Bogomil philosophy was critical to understanding the mass rapes in 1992 and 1993, I nearly tossed the book in the trash. The Bogomils were a medieval religious sect that died out in the 1500s. Recent scholarship has questioned not only their influence, but also whether the Bosnian nobles were even Bogomils in the first place. The writer relies on a single interview with a seemingly distraught woman, she quotes extensively from the interview and decides that understanding this obscure theology is a useful tool for her readers. Maybe if she'd done the research instead of quoting someone she felt sorry for, the book would be better."
3,So-so,"The mood of this book is a little on the liberal side. I wasn't sure if the author was yelling at me at times or not. On the positive, gives information on the different divisions in Bosnia to include ethnic groups, religious groups, geopolitical and geoethnic groups. The most interesting thing I learned from the book is the pastoral cultural of the Balkans and the view of the knife. How the knife is a weapon/tool of great significant value and is very dear to the Balkan people."
3,Mediocre,"Mostly a personal account, not much real data. Sort of a feminist take on rape in wartime, but a little under-researched and over-dramatized. Not recommended."
3,"Funky and fusion, but not so good as Uberjam","I am a fan of John Scofield from the very beginning. The way he plays is ""unique"".But, sincerely, I expected more of the new album.In spite of this, Scofield bring us always fresh and new shemes of music."
1,Buyer Beware!,I bought this collection for the 50s & 60s songs. The 70s songs didn't interest me so it didn't bother me that they were covers. For the price the 50s & 60s songs would have been worth it. You should be aware BEFORE you buy this that only 2 of these songs are original recordings.
2,Just okay,"This budget cd,""Essentials Best of Bob Marley"" is just borderline average. As the above poster says--there is something wrong with the sound quality. And supposedly, this is a ""remastered"" cd. The actual sound of the music is faily good quality. What is bad is the vocals. Right away, I'm like, what? No, no ,no. This sounds like they mixed good music with the scratchy sound of a 45 rpm record and tried to sneak it past the consumer as remastered. There is some good here. It contains songs that are not ususally on a Bob Marley best of, like-- Duppy Conqueror, Soul Rebel and Soul Shakedown Party. Yes get this in a better quality, but if you must, don't pay more than four bucks for it."
4,k-d tool 2199 double flar tool set review,"one of my biggest concerns when purchasing an automotive tool is its accuracy. I used this tool to completely redo all the brake lines in my 1996 Jeep cherokee. Needless to say this tool more than paid for itself. All the flares are clean with minimal burr and flash. More importantly I had zero leak after all the brake lines were connected back on. Even after 2years after I performed the brake job with this flare tool, no leak. I trust this tool"
5,Jerry Garcia and Dylan,Many people attempt to sing Dylan songs. Jerry always seems to nail it; in his own style. This is a great two CD set. The cover is different as advertised. No Problem. It features the Jerry Garcia Band - Legion of Mary and of course the Dead. Jerry up front in all three. Highly recommended.
4,Nice,"This is quite good for anybody who wants a good representation of Jerry's interpretations of Dylan's music, with some fine versions of Tough Mama and Simple Twist of Fate. I must admit that I am a sucker for Jerry Band covers of Dylan. The Dylan lyric with the Jerry Band mojo is perfect for Jerry's style and soul to come shining through. A regrettable omission is Tears of Rage."
3,Poor sound,"Great songs, neat long versions - but the sound is so poor. On Track 1 CD 1 the vocals are so back in the mix, they are hardly noticeable. It gets only a little better after that."
3,Informative,"I found this book to be very helpful for researching Margaret Atwood's book ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Ms. Stein is very knowledgable on Margaret Atwood and her works, and her book was well organized so that I found the information I needed quite easily. Thanks to this book I will be able to achieve an A on my senior paper!"
3,"Confused, regarding other reviews...","This deck is as well constructed as a hobo's cardboard shack. What i mean to say, is that the only redeeming feature of the deck, is Relinquished and a few magic cards. The toon monsters you can forget; to actually use these monsters, one must draw one specific card out of 50 (of course the probability increases as you draw cards, but ur life points will tend to behave inversely) and by the time one actually draws Toon World, his/her life points are already down to nill. Had it not been for the fact that there was an extreme shortage of decent monsters, i would not be so condemning about this deck, but unfortunately that is not the case. In recent games, i found myself fending off direct hits to my life points with nothing more than a few magic cards. (And let me tell you that there is nothing ""more fun"" than receiving direct hits to your life points from 4 monsters.) This deck is a dud. Buy only for the sake of collecting."
5,This deck is a quick winner,"Well, no one wants to hear a 10-year old blab on and on about the pegasus starter deck, so I'll make it breif....Let's see pegasus has 2 more negation cards than joeys deck(magic jammer, mystical space typhoon) so it pretty much guarentees you get your toons out(unless you used all your negation cards) then play ultimate offering, summon all the toons and....ATTACK DIRECTLY!!!Joeys is good because it has scrapegoat but Pegasus is easier to use."
4,nice deck,"this deck has good cards. you pull out your relinquished after he fuses his blue eyes and Bingo, down he goes! plus, you get toon monsters. cool, right?"
5,fun!,This is one card game that is not complicated. It has less complication than any other trading card deck I know. This deck has great cards.
4,The cartoon man's deck has finally come out!,"I was happy when this deck came out so I could get three more holgraphic cards, which are Reinqueshed, Graceful Charity, and Griphon Wing.This series is different from pokemon{both the the anime and card game, which has the pokemon, energies, and trainers}.But yu-gi-oh has fushions, summons and rituals, magic and trap cards, and the monsters.With all the new character decks, I wouldn't be surpised if they came out with decks like Weevil, Mako, etc. But I'd really like to own Marik's deck."
3,Pegasus' deck is okay... Written by an experienced duelist,"My first impression of the deck was that it was going to be the most powerful deck ever. I was wrong. Toon World seems like a waste of time to me. They take a long time to get going and with magic jammer or another card like that, an opponent could stop your toon monsters right in their tracks. However, If you get lucky and you actually get some toon monsters on the field, you are in good shape. My favorite card in here by far is Relinquished. Ritual monsters can sometimes be a pain but it is worth it if you can get relinquished on the field. Overall, this deck will probably have just as many losses as wins if left alone. You may simply want to take out various cards and place them in a different deck. If this is your first time playing Yugioh, do not buy this deck. I reccomend begginers buy the Kaiba Evolution Deck. Hope this helps!"
5,"Daaaaaaang, this is fun.","This deck is awesome for someone who's been playing Yu-Gi-Oh! for a while, but for a beginner, sometimes it's a bit overwhelming. It's got Toon cards (yay!) and Toon World (YERY useful, one-time payment of LP!) Break out the card sleeves (trust me, put the cards in there), and get this!"
5,pegasus,"This deck is pretty cool becuase, of toon world and all of the other toon monsters. In my opinion the yugi deck would be a good beginer deck. his best card is relinquished even know it only has 0 attack and o defense it is still a pretty good card. My favorite deck is joey because it has polymerzation, red eyes and time wizard."
5,Very very good game,"The rules are very intricate and may take a while to completly grip, especially for 5 down or old up. All the decks have their charecter's traditional cards. [For this one, Toon World, the toon monsters, Relinquished, et cetra] I have all the decks and more so I should know."
3,probably THE WORST starter deck,I am now here to tell you the downside of this deck. ...i heard was this is the best deck well i say its the worst. 1st of all you need at least 3 cards in your hand to summon relinquished who [disappoint] if your opponent has de spell. then theres the awful toons that you have to pay 500 life points each toon to attack. well if you buy lots of other cards and get the right cards in your hand i guess it could be ok. but i think that joey and yugi decks are the best because they have good magic cards. ...
2,dont waste,this is the worst starter deck ever. next to yugis but graceful charity is the only worth while thing in this deck.Dont waste your time believe a master duelist.And if you dont believe me got to upperdeck.comand go to ranks my duelist name is RareHunter.
5,Destruction Deck,"The Pegasus deck can polverise your oponent, but only if you know how to use your cards. For example: using Sonic Bird's effect to get Black Illusionnist Ritual then use Witch of the Black Forest's effect to get Relinquished into your hand.If you get the Joey's deck and combine the two decks tand you have good stratigies, you'll be unbeatable!"
2,hitachi universal charger,"Product will not charge the drill , but will charge the lamp(flash Light). I have no idea why It will not charge the drill battery."
5,TREMENDOUS PRAISE & WORSHIP FOR THE LORD,"THIS IS A GOOD CLASSIC PRAISE AND WORSHIPBEAUTIFUL SLOW ADORATION AND WONDERFUL JUBILEE SONGS TO DANCE UNTO THE LORDYOU DON'T FIND THIS KIND OF WORSHIP ANYMORETHE LATE 80'S AND EARLY 90'S WERE A TIME OF RESTORATION AND AWAKENING TO PRAISE AND WORSHIP THAT WAS MORE BIBLE LIKE TO WORSHIP OUR MESSIAH JESUS IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH WITH UNDERSTANDING.NOW ADAYS WE HAVE MESSIANIC PRAISE & WORSHIP THAT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN SOUND BUT THEY ARE MUCH INTO JUDAISM WHICH IS CONTRARY TO REAL CHRISTIANY.NESSIANIC PRAISE AND WORSHIP MUST BE FOCUS ON THE SON OF GOD, JESUS, AND NOT ON JUDAISM WHICH IS THE LEGALISTIC RELIGIOUS JEWISH SYSTEM."

1,Stop The Insanity Right NOW!!!,"Don't waste your money on this. All of these crappy fizzled out pop songs are played repetitively on FM radio, so it's not like your life is going to fall apart if you don't have ""Don't Cha"" at your finger tips.

5,Yes!,"All the hits are RIGHT HERE on one album. It doesn't get any better than this. Thank goodness for these ""Now"" albums. Hip hop, dance, pop, and teen queens are right here!Now, I know a couple of people are going to counter this review. Go ahead. I dare you. See what happens."
3,still slipping..,"The NOW series was pretty revolutionary when it first started. The first several discs in the series are packed with great music, most of them #1 hits. The last few offerings seem a pale shadow of previous releases. Many #1 hits have been left out. It's still a decently good CD with the usualy varied types of music contained within. In all honesty, I think anyone who is seriously interested in collecting sets of music like this, is far better off getting the version of the series released in Europe. To give you a hint on the difference, the U.S. released series is up to NOW 20, the European released series is up to NOW 61. Although this is still a decent CD, it doesn't have anything I really ""can't live without"" contained on it. NOW 1-5 are probably the best discs released in the entire U.S. series. 6-10 are still pretty good overall. Any of the series, from NOW 11 on, all seem to slip further into bring an overall worse compilation of music than each previous year's release."
3,Yet another average Now compilation.,"Each time I know that a Now CD is going to be released, I become excited, hoping that this is the number that is going to be a CD that I can listen to all the way through. This was a promising release until I noticed the glaring omission of a few songs, including Shake It Off (how dare they)My vote for good song choices: Lose Control, Don't Phunk With My Heart, Don't Cha, Pon De Replay, Like You, Cater 2 U, Behind These Hazel Eyes, Just Want You To Know, Just The GirlSome songs I want to see on Now 21: Shake It Off, Luxurious, Gold Digger, Stickwitu, Hang Up, Stand Up For Love, Boyfriend, Shine On (couldn't hurt to include Ryan Cabrera), Dance Dance, We Be Burnin', If It's Lovin' That You Want, Can I Have It Like That, My Humps, Outta Control remix, I Don't Care (some of these are charted within Billboard's Hot 100)"

1,Why?,"Why do they constantly have to churn out these crappy compilations every few months, Why can't they wait like 6 months in between so that way they can pick the the best songs not just ones they hear constantly on the radio like the rap. And one other thing next time try to pick arists that everybody has heard of I don't even know who half of these people are but then again i don't watch much MTV or VH1 since they stopped playing music."
1,Let's Hope They End at 20!,"More of the same recycled hip hop, rap, garage band crap. Ludakwis, Keith Urban Cowboy, etc...Most of these songs/artists I have never even heard before. I give it 1 star for including Backstreet Boys though. For nostalgic purposes only!"
2,A+?!,"I highly disagree of a rating of A+ when there were loads of big hits that weren't chosen on the disc. Since TH is discontinued, they can use any song now, and this is the best they can come up with? Shake It Off? Wake Me Up When Septmember Ends? Gold Digger? More Than Words? Bananza? Cool? Scars? Get It Poppin? Hello? I do admit some of these picks are good, but if I don't know a song from a NOW album and the #1 song of the past month isn't on, no A+ from me.NOW 21 IDEAS:Because Of YouGold DiggerPhotographRun ItMy HumpsYour BodyStickwituDon't Forget About UsWe Be BurningLuxuoriousHung UpBoyfriendSoul SurvivorDirty Little SecretIf It's Lovin That You WantI'm $prungDon't BotherCheck On ItShe Says"
4,Now 20 saves the now that's what i call muzik series!,i was really worried about now 20 due to the fact that now 18 and now 19 were reeeeeealy dissapointing. sorry i am a huge rap fan. pleeeease forgive me all you non rap fans. my only real gripe is that 50 cent isn't on here. why not put him on here. disco inferno is no ruder than pimpin all over the world. still this is a good cd and it saves the now that's what i call muzik series (from my point of view)
1,"NOW,THIS IS TRASH","NOW 20 is the worst piece of trailer park trash available presently.It does not get any worse than this.This lousy compilation features eminently forgettable tripe like BLACK EYED PEAS,MISSY ELIOT,BOW WOW(WOOF WOOF),BACKSTREET BOYS,DESTINY'S CHILD PUSSYCAT DOLLS,CIARA and KELLY CLARKSON.You will instantly lose your credibility by being seen buying this trash.Get the best of FOGHAT instead."
1,Worst of the bunch,"I have listened to the first 20 now cds, and for the most part the earlier ones were better. Of the later group, this was by far the worst. It feels like the producers just picked 20 random songs, certainly not the best hits of the year, and slapped them together to cash in on the NOW name."
4,"1/2 good, 1/2 bad","I personally don't enjoy the NOW collections too much but this one is okay.1. Lose Control- 2/52. Don't Phunk With My Heart- 2/5 Couldn't they have picked a better Black Eyed Peas song like 'Don't Lie' 'Pump It' or 'My Humps'?3. Don't Cha- 5/54. Pon De Replay- 0/55. Pimpin' All Over The World- 3/56. Like You- 3/57. I Think they Like Me- 5/58. Cater 2 U- 0/59. Must Be Nice- 0/510. These Words- 0/511. Behind These Hazel Eyes- 3/512. Listen To Your Heart- 4/513. Just Want You To Know- 4/514. Just The Girl- 6/5 AWESOME SONG15. Do You Want To- 1/516. Beverly Hills- 5/517. Sugar, We're Goin Down- 5/518. You & Me- 3/519. Fix You- 4/520. You'll Think of Me 3/5"
1,BOYCOTT THE,TOP 40 IS FOR SISSIES! THERE IS NO DECENT MUSIC ON ANY NOW CD! GO CLASSIC ROCK! GO PROGRESSIVE! GO METAL! KILL TOP 40 AND ALL THE GREEDY [Girls] WHO MAKE IT!!!
4,Great mix,Now you can say this cd contains all of the songs that have been completly out played this season! Even the last song and the only country song has been played over and over again. Ironically they're all songs that I love to hang on to. It makes some great back ground music to break the ice at a party as well.
2,Not what I expected,"I have been a fan of Annie Haslam since her Renaissance days. I admit many people forewarned me about this record, but being Annie the kind of singer and songwriter she is, I decided to give the record a try. Adicionally, Larry Fast was involved in a couple of songs, so that added to my decision.To put it bluntly: I was dissapointed. The songs are too bland and ""syrupy"" to my liking (granted: What was I expecting from a record dedicated to angels? - my mistake!). The lyrics are good, though, if you are into this sort of thing...From a die-hard prog music fan: There are better records!"
5,Grossman's blues guitar instruction,Stefan Grossman's blues guitar instruction DVD(lesson 1) is excellent. He starts from the basics of tuning to clear examples of various finger styles and techniques with several songs. Each song is taught carefully and played slowly on a split screen--left and right hand. In my estimation it is like having a live teacher with you explaining these techniques. I highly recommend this and others in the series for guitarists on every level.jay alexander
4,Pretty good for an intermediate player,First thing: go to the TAB version in the back and print them out. Then use that along with Stefans lessons. This is easy going mostly open chord blues with twists - all at a moderate pace. It is not blues scales all over the guitar neck. But I did enjoy learning something different and found it worth the money.I am a rather advanced player and I picked up some now ideas and techniques by learning the songs he teaches and applying the ideas to my own style. You don't have to be very advanced but you need to at least know your basic open chords. He explains it well and then reviews it to help you 'get it.'
3,An OK Product,I felt that the instructor rushed through the CD. If he would have went slower and more methodical I would have understood it sooner and better.
4,"Quality tool, not as useful as expected","The tool bent tubing, 3/16"" steel and Cunifer brake line, effectively without marring or kinking the tubing. However in my application the tool was of limited use due to its inability to create small radius bends which are required in the fabrication of automotive brake lines."
4,"A Quick, yet interesting book","Russel Baker's style of writing doesn't confuse us with large impressive words. However, he does keep us interested. I found myself unable to put this book down. Baker takes us through the journy of his life. The good, bad, the sad, and the exciting. This is a book that everyone can relate to and im sure will be enjoyed by all who do read this book."
1,Incomplete?!,"Well, great story, but much of the text is omitted from the tapes. Unfortunately much of the stuff that was left out was integral to the story backdrop. You get 4 tapes and about 35 minutes for each- so they left a bunch of stuff out to make it fit. Otherwise it could have used at least on more tape, and that was probably too expensive to package... I am not happy with the result. However, the reading was very good, the story as read out loud leaves a bad thin film in the mouth, and a feeling that you were cheated out of the story entirely."
1,"nothing out of the ordinary, really","too long, boring, pointless.....if i wrote a book about coming of age, i would definitely have more action to report."
1,Unoriginal & Boring,"I read a lot of books, and I seldom find one as tedious and boring to read as this one. Nothing happens! As a family memoir (if I were in Baker's family), I'd appreciate this work, but as it is, I could not find anything to take with me. The character development is minimal at best; because of this, I felt nothing for the Depression-era struggles this family faced. Mr. Baker's descriptions are simplistic at best and he uses far too much foreshadowing to make you want to even continue to the next page because you know exactly what will happen. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Don't really know what all the fuss is about,"It's well written, certainly, but tends to get sentimental to the point of almost saccharine. Have I become used to the memoir as a genre, and this was a trailblazer that's no longer appreciated for the ground it broke, or was it just over-rated to begin with?"
3,Not his best work.....,"This is the second book in the Alex Benedict series. Alex is a dealer of antiquities who sets out, with his partner Chase Kolpath, to unravel the mysterious disappearanceof the entire crew of the Polaris.The story is good, but at times somewhat confusing. I would recommend reading this book in one sitting as to follow the plot and all the characters more easily."
1,Pointless waste of time.,"The mystery could have been so profound, but limped in front of me like a lame duck. The characters were shallow and undeveloped. There are cripples and elderly who move faster than this plot, seriously! I sincerely hope that future humans are nothing like this person writes them. If they are, let's pray for WW3."
4,Just try to have some fun with it,"Polaris is essentially a murder-mystery set in the far future. As long as you don't take it too seriously, and aren't looking for profound or challenging writing, you can have some fun reading it.I'm not a big McDevitt fan, but I like the Alex Benedict novels. They're reasonably well crafted, if a little trite in places. Just think of this book as a little ""roughage"" for your mind."
3,Plain Story,"I understand JMD wants to keep us engrossed and thrilled but why make AB and CK miraculously escape crashing TWICE! Isn't once enough? Besides, all the plot lies on the fact that a person, party concerned, having the key to the mystery didn't get questioned when the Polaris passengers were found missing. Isn't that a bit short and frail? That story tastes like a peppered rehash and some reworking would have been welcome before having it published. Well, let's be positive and say the book reads easily in spite of a repetitious and transparent plot thread."
4,Polaris,Terrific variation on the Mary Celeste incident of our era. Well written; however it wasn't entirely clear why the artifacts from the ship had to be systematically destroyed.
2,McDevitt's flat note,"The first McDevitt books I read,Seeker,Omega, andThe Engines of Godreally blew me away. So I was looking forward to ""Polaris.""It is too bad I had high expectations. This book comes complete with: stereotyped character types, an incomplete grasp of basic human psychology, stilted and uneven story pace, and a smattering of Big Ideas that become trivialized in the ho-hum of the plot.I grit my teeth and read till the end, but I was not rewarded for my efforts with any cookie.It is too bad, because the Big Ideas and awesome backdrops to his stories can make for wonderful reading. But this book is really all too boring.McDevitt has some very strong strengths as a writer, strengths that are emphasized in his earlier books, and some of his later books. Unless you are a devotee of this series, I wouldn't advise anyone to waste the time."
4,Go Audible,"I have to admit that I didn't read this book, I listened to the audion version by Audible. Non the less I found this to be a good story that certainly kept me guessing till the very end. I have become a huge fan of the Alex Benedict novels even though A Talent For War still remains the best of the series."
5,sponge bob is the bomb!!,i'd say sponge bob is very cool. this one was not the best one i'd say because 95% of the movie you could not hear what sponge bob was saying because he was talking all prehistoric like a cave man but i got to say it was very ummm lets see kind of interesting!
2,"Good Film, Poor Copy","""Banana Peel"" is a good French comedy by Marcel Ophuls,(son of Max!) excellently interpreted by some great actors such as J.P.Belmondo, Jeanne Moreau, Gert Froebe, J.P.Marielle and others, unfortunately it suffers from having been badly recorded on DVD. The DVD is most likely a copy of the VHS version. This good film deserves a better treatment and should have been remastered from the original. At least there is a version of it on DVD which has not yet been released in France"
3,Great Movie needs restoration,Just watched this movie. Loved it. It is obviously the inspiration for many con artist movies and television shows.It deserves restoration. It is pan and scan so in many scenes you lose the actors and only hear dubbed dialogue.The original french language version would do much to enhance the enjoyment of the film.
2,Over-Rated,"It only slightly improved my signal no matter where I positioned the antenna. But in all fairness I am using it inside a police station where there are rampant rf signals. However, these rf signals are on a 800 mhz. frequency band and should not cause any interference with wireless broadband signals."
2,Warning! Another cash-in compilation!,"This album was considerably less accomplished than I'd hoped (possibly like the movie?) It's a ragbag of trendy hopeful and has-been groups (I'll leave you to fill in the blanks), all creating their own sonic soup with no connection to anyone or anything else, and the newly-recorded versions of Bernard Herrmann's original score are fragmentary and simply faster. A dud."
4,A great soundtrack,"I don't know why people want this CD to be like the original one and they end up disappointed when listening to it...This album can't be like the original because it's from a remake. The purpose of the modern version movie was not to make an exactly copy of it but to recapture and make us relive the incredible story of psycho in our modern world. I think the CD recapture well the essence of this new version and if you are a fan of Psycho, you will certainly like it. It's special in its own way."
1,The most unacceptable thing that has ever been done...,"I can't belive they actually tried to recreate this Soundtrack.... All there is to hear is .... I can't belive what they did, they completely ruined the image of this movie and its soundtrack. I would have given it half a star but I can't in this web page!!! >:-("
2,An ok soundtrack,"The only good things on the soundtrack is Danny Elfman makeover of the origianl score and Rob Zombie's Living Dead Girl.Other then that,kind of a waste of your money."
5,This was something I heard and loved years ago..........glad to be able to get it!,This was the last CD you had of GLORY OF LOVE......the piano music is awesome and I gave it as a gift to my brother who loves piano...........thanx.........the price was great too! :)
4,STILL MISSING SOME TRACKS,"I'M STILL LOOKING FOR ""DISCO DANCIN"" CANT FIND IT ANYWHWERE...IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE JUST POST IT UP...IM FROM ATLANTA AND THEY USED TO PLAY THE HELL OUT OF G.Q. NEED THAT DISCO DANCIN..THEN MY COLLECTION WILL BE COMPLETE.."
4,Thanks to All!!,"Hello,My name is Herb Lane. I had the time of my lifeplaying the keys and back vocal (tenor) for the group GQ.Lots of fond memories and I truly miss the other tree Guys.I just wanted to say thanks to our fans and thatlife is beautiful and still amazing!Ofcourse I cannot rate my own product. Just filled it in to post.I am happy to see it still has merrit.Herb of GQ"
4,good disc,i've always enjoyed there flow and style.i do love you still sounds great as does disco nights. there voices were strong on these songs.a good collection to have.
4,GQ,"Excellent , good oldies 80;s music. memories galore, will not disappoint, highly recommended soulful remakes of classic songs plus original material included."
2,Heavy-handed underachiever,"Joyce Carol Oates is capable of much better. For proof, see novels like ""Them,"" ""Wonderland,"" or ""Expensive People"" - or short story collections like ""Heat."" But here, she takes a tragedy from over thirty years ago and exploits it to what I can only call ill effect.I am no great friend of Ted Kennedy. I'm ashamed of what he did when he drove Mary Jo Kopechne off a bridge in Chappaquiddick. But as painful as that must have been for Mary Jo and the Kopechne family, Oates wants us to feel that pain as well. The unfortunate result of her heavy-handed, self-righteous interpretation, though - and her inexplicable use of repetition - is that it's painful to read for the wrong reasons.Like I said, Oates is capable of much better, and I'm one of her great fans. But ""Black Water"" disappointed me, and I cannot recommend it."
1,Do not use for a book club!,We used this book for a book club book. It was horrible!! It is a repeating essay based on Ted Kennedy's car accident. It is an artistic story from the womans perspective. It took less than an hour to read and we all felt that we wasted an hour!Much better books out there!
5,"Drowning in the ""Black Water"" - you will feel it yourself!",This novel shows Kelly Kelleher drowning in the black water of a creek after a car accident with The Senator whom she met on a party that day. It tells again and again parts of her life while she is fighting for it trying to free herself out of the car. The accident is described many times but this repetitions are typical for the novel and every time we get more information about the accident itself and her life which is told by her thoughts and feelings.It is not easy to read but once you get used to it is a great experience.
3,Black Water,"I rated Black Water by Joyce Carol Oats a 3. I rated this a 3 because I really liked it, but at the same time I thought it was too old for me. Also, looking at the front cover and reading the title made me think it would be some sort of mystery, but looks can be deceiving. I thought it was a little old for me because I didn't understand some of the words. I thought they were too mature for me. I recommend this book to adult teens that like realistic fiction."
2,"catched my attention, but the whole thing was very confusing","I Read this book for my English III class, since i like mysteries, i figured this book would get my attention. but it didnt, i think this book skipped around a bunch, between the black water and the girls life. Overall, it was an ok book, but I would not read it again."
3,Horrifying,"As horror, Black Water is great. It's been about twenty years since I read the book, and I often still think of it as I'm driving over a bridge. As a supposed study of power and sexual politics, it's shallow at best."
4,Interesting,"I read this book in one sitting (almost). Of course, it was a familiar story - having been very much alive when the Chappaquiddick accident happened. I kept abreast through the years of every new discovery about the accident. Of course, in the fictional book, I kept hoping maybe she would escape. I liked this book and it certainly was unique."
4,Chillingly claustrophobic,"This chillingly claustrophobic narrative of a woman driven to her death by a senator she meets at an Independence Day party lies somewhere between Chappaquiddick and ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge."" According to Wikipedia, Mary Jo Kopechne ""lived for at least two hours down there.""Two hours trapped in an overturned car in freezing brackish water. Two hours with shattered bones. Two hours of twisting her body into unnatural shapes to keep her mouth from being submerged... to keep what little oxygen was available continuing to fill her lungs. Two hours to recall bits and pieces of a life lived until suddenly it wasn't.Joyce Carol Oates has a keen ability to pull the reader right into the black water along with the pretty young woman who went off a bit too eagerly with the senator and his two extra vodka-and-tonics for the road. The blackness closes in... And. She. Died."
4,An amazing novel written with much tension,"The book is a powerful description of the accident that really happened. It accuratly shows the feelings of the strongminded young woman - losing hope at last - drowning in the car. The book will bring you down to the process of dying. Joyce Carol Oates combines death with other themes: Politics, power and love.Don't read it before you go sleeping, otherwise you will get heavy nightmares."
3,A book to drown (in),"Fate: A young woman's fate drowning in a submerged car, constructed around a plot possibly summed up on one page (or three in this book) resembling the tragic Chappaquddick incident.When reading this, one is overwhelmed by Oates' narrative talent, being able to stretch the story throughout a 150-page book, using an exceeding stream-of-conscience. The story, however, lacks real character development. Depending on the contents, they are given no opportunity to go beyond their flat beings featured here.The issues dealt with are mostly connected with the motif of power and its destructive as well as fate-determining impact on the people's lifes - at least provoking.Interesting yet nothing else."
5,Feel the Death,"""Black Water"" is one of the most exciting book I've ever read!Joyce Carol Oates involves the reader in an unbelievable way. Read the book and feal close to death!"
3,Quick reading...quickly forgettable?,"This is not a bad book. This is my first Joyce Carol Oates book, and I don't know what I was expecting, but this certainly wasn't it. This is a small book about a small tragedy. The main strength of the book is its narrative form--short chapters written in a type of flashback-stream-of-consciousness-slowly-unraveling-and-fleshing-out way. The author's descriptions are certainly vivid enough to evoke emotion, but the lack of character development (or the almost-trite portrayal of the characters) detracts from the book. The best way to think of Black Water is as a study of theme and variations, a story that could be 3 pages long or could last forever.Verdict: a fun and engaging read, but for readers who are seeking depth and enjoy really committing to a book, this might be one to pass on."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I love just about anything boysenberry, and I have tasted quite a few syrups, jams etc. I used to use Smucker's mostly, but I noticed that the flavor of their syrups had diminished so I quit buying them. I thought I'd try Pioneer Valley ""Gourmet"" Boysenberry Syrup even though it cost me about $12 for an 11.5 oz bottle after shipping. It was not what I expected. It lacked the same rich boysenberry flavor I had missed in other syrups. Don't get me wrong, the ingredients are wholesome.... no water or corn syrup, and boysenberry juice is listed first on the bottle. In my opinion, the juice gets too diluted with the other ingredients, and a juice concentrate should be used instead."
3,Boysenberry Syrup,"My daughter's daughter likes Boysenberry Syrup and I couldn't find it in our local stores, I ordered it on line. We like it. Thank you."
5,A excellent compilation; a great intro to Real World Records,"I've long been a fan of Real World Records, led there by an interest in Peter Gabriel. This compilation reaffirms that interest with every listen.""A Week or Two in the Real World"" is a veritable cream of the crop. Every track is something new and unique.If you're new to the ambigiously named ""world music"" genre, this compilation is a great place to start. A smart way to get your feet wet in this extraordinarily broad and rich genre.Highly recommended."
1,Don't Buy,This product was by far one of the worst things that I have purchased on the internet. It didn't fit and of my multi. PSPs would charge the one that I tried to make it fit in and was blugged so bad I was afraid to put it in anything. So pissed about this product that I don't even want to talk to them about a refund. Duck and run.
1,"Disappointing for a ""Not So Big House"" fan","I agree with many of the poor reviews by fellow ""Not So Big House"" thinkers. I was very, very disappointed by the lack of practical information and very few useful principles for ""creating the landscape of home"".While I agree with and have used so many of the principles in her other books, this one left me with nothing I can use to landscape my property.While some of the examples are quite interesting, most are also quite unusual and there is not much to take away for those of us with average-sized, rectangular-shaped lots living in subdivisions filled with tract homes."
2,"Too much ""designspeak""","Having stumbled upon this book at the library and being familiar with the ""Not So Big"" approach I thought this book would be interesting. Not so. Lots of beautiful images at extraordinary locations but a surprising lack of concrete principles which one could apply to their own landscape. OK, I get ""places and paths"" and a few other concepts sprinkled throughout the book (""frames""comes to mind). But ""defusing the energy of the corner"" and many other abstract explanations for design decisions leaves the reader to guess as to what the designer was thinking.And the self-congratulatory remarks between authors are over the top..."
1,Not-So-Big out of gas,"The Not-So-Big franchise has run out of gas. I thought the first three books were helpful. This is no better than your average article on landscaping from a home magazine. It is a collection of projects that were done for not-so-poor clients. I would recommend that you purchase the book ""Pattern Language"" (Alexander, editor) where most of her good ideas came from in the first place."
3,"Beautiful book, but Not So Big - Not","It is a beautiful book that is well written and illustrated. So I'll give it 3 stars. But I don't believe it belongs in the Not So Big series. It feels like false advertising or misrepresentation. I appreciate the concept of connecting the outside and inside, but I expected to see ideas for small gardens/yards in small lots, not small planting areas within large lots and acreage attached to large houses."
4,Lovely addition to any Titanic/Celtic collection,"This awesome collection comes with 3 CDs of lovely music. The first CD includes a few songs from the movie as well as a number of classical pieces, some played on the real Titanic. The last two CDs are filled with traditional Irish songs. I was kinda dissapoined with the instrumentation, and most of the songs are played by harp. But other than that, the songs are really lovely. Get this if you are a fan of Celtic music."
1,not so much,"I was recently given this as a gift, and after listening to it my words of advice is don't waste your money. This cd consists of cheesy love ballades done on a synthetic keyboard. Despite the fact that the word Celtic is in the title of the cd, none of this music is Celtic. there isn't even so much as a fake fiddle. its all synthesized flutes and bad piano. I would have given it no stars if It were allowed.so my advise is to not waste your money or time on this one, if you liked the music from titanic buy that soundtrack if you like Celtic music I suggest you check out the movie and soundtrack to ""The Secret of Roan Inish"", the band ""The Irish Rovers"", ""The Corrs"" of even ""Enya"""
2,BAD COMMUNICATION RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDER,"When I placed the order I was not told this item was on back order. I was going on a diving vacation and found after I ordered, this item would not be available prior to my departure. The result was cancelling the order. However, on my vacation I found this shirt at a dive shop at a much lower price! So, the cancellation certainly worked to my advantage. I will not order from this company again for failing to note this item was not available when I ordered it."
1,Runs small,"I bought this product on the advice of a friend who lives on a boat in the Caribbean who wears a rash guard year round. I bought both a medium and a large as I am a women's size 10. The picture is accurate. You can see your lingerie through the shirt, and fits up to the base of your neck. I couldn't get into the medium. The large runs small and I found it hot. She likes them. I returned it."
2,Very disappointing,"Perhaps it is insightful into a composer's mind, to see whatHE thought was noteworthy, or of that which he is most proud,but this CD is unbelievably dull. I hoped for some of themore exciting and unusual stuff from, say, the film PRESSUREPOINT. Or some of tbe delightful bits from THE YOUNGPHILADELPHIAN. Frankly, this material would bore people in anICU. Skip it."
5,Perfecto!,"I don't know how she does it. Diane's truly awesome. All her characters are so realistic. I especially like this one, because sometimes Laurel doesn't know what she's feeling. How true is that? And she really does what her heart's saying is right. I admire her for that. One thing I didn't like, though, is that it almost seems like TOO much tragedy is happening in Laurel's life. I mean, good happens, too, but I've never had so much stuff happen to me as the Walker girls had. Awesome book, just like the others."
5,Book Full of Emotions,"""The Year I Turned Sixteen"" series is the best series I have ever read. All four of them touched my heart, but Laurel's was, in my opinion, the most touching of them all. Every girl has a long time friend, and suddenly when they want more than a friendship, things are really interesting. I felt like Laurel and Jack were real people and I cried when he would not accept her invitation to Rose's wedding. Daisy's death also made me cry because she was the glue that held them together. She was very positive. I also feel bad for Lily when she sends e-mails on the computer about her problems at home. For anyone who wants to read a series about love and life, I recommend this series. (Hint: Just read Rose's first because the characters are first mentioned in her book. The most interesting thing is seeing them grow up over a course of eight years.)"
5,The Suitcase,"The product is perfect, it is almost as new!The shipping was fast, it took even less than expected!!! A plus :)"
4,Loving Crabtree & Evelyn Spring Rain for 20 Years,"I have been using Spring Rain Bath & Shower gel as a bubble bath for maybe 20 years. I can no longer find it at Crabtree & Evelyn stores, so I order it online. I just hope it is never discontinued....that will make me so sad."
3,It's Surprisingly Not To bad!,"I bought this because I love all things Sabbath and have always respected Geezer Butler's talents. His amazing bass playing in Sabbath is legendary and his lyrical trips are very cool indeed.When I first tossed this sucker on I was like, well it's not bad at all. However after a few listens it has grown on me over time. The tunes are very tight and very refreshing. It's not Sabbath, it's something else and it's very good. The production is very good as well. The guitar tone is excellent and the chops are very good. The vocals go from straight on hard rock belting out to growls and it's great!! The Geezer signature sound is here (Gawd how I love that tone!!) and his parts are very well thought out. They are typical Geezer in that their not to overbearing, yet are very full and fat. The drums are right on and only add to an already enjoyable listening experience.This cd was a welcome surprise and probably a 3.5 stars out of 5."
5,"New Stuff, Awesome","I bought this expecting to hear some sabbath-style tracks but I found none of that. I found over-the-top aggression and power. The music is awesome and the vocals are great- right on the border between singing and screaming most of the time, which is pretty awesome. It sounds like an old guy trying to fit in with the new... and succeeding!"
3,Good Stuff but no Plastic Planet,A pretty good album from the best rock bassist in the Universe. I prefer Plastic Planet and especially Black Science.
2,Wow...,"What's with the grunge/Disturbed/GWAR-type sound? There's a couple of songs that are well written & played, but the rest sound like an old guy trying to fit in with the new. Stick to playing bass."
3,Geezer failed to bring it to the table,"I am a huge fan of Geezer's previous albums, but this album just does not live up to the others. To be honest, this album was rushed out because Geezer was caught up with the Sabbath reunion deal at the time and I read an interview before the album came out saying that it was written and recorded in a week and for this reason it shows (just look at the title of the album, super cheesy). The songs lack depth and it seems this album was just done to finish a record contract. I was greatly disappointed when I listened to this album and still agree that it is the weakest Geezer solo album. I wish he would put out another album on the level of the first two albums. If you are a fan of Sabbath/Geezer/Ozzy its obviously a must have."
3,movie back to novel,"after seeing tom ford's wonderful translation of ""a single man"" at my neighborhood cineplex, i wondered about the novel upon which it was based. i read early christopher isherwood in my 20's--berlin stories, prater violet--loved them but never read another isherwood story for the next 50 years. now the film aroused my curiosity & i ordered the book from amazon. reading it made me appreciate how beautifully ford found ways to convert the novel's rather dry & somewhat remote tragedy into a film of painfully close-up loss. short & well-worth reading--but don't miss the movie!"
3,"This book is very sad, except for the time spent with Charli","I thought George is a very sad person and we can understand why of course, he lost his best friend. But other than that, he's kind of weird. This book is a bit old so younger people might not be able to relate to it as well as older folks."
4,"Better than the movie, which was also good","I enjoyed theA Single Man, because I am a sucker for movies set in the late 60s. Having been born in the late 60s, the look of movies likeAwakenings, or evenAustin Powers in Goldmemberis rather comforting.However, I enjoyed this book even more, because it is so rich in describing not only how things look but how the main character feels and thinks.<Spoiler alert>The only beef I have with this story is the ending. To have George die in the end is a cheap way of closing. I am sure Isherwood did not mean that a gay man can only attain closure and contentment by dying, but it comes off that way. At least to me. I felt cheated.</spoiler alert>Other than that, a quick and enjoyable read."
4,Easy to put together.,"I would have rated this item 5 stars if it had a better way to keep it from falling over. The first night the wind was about 10mph and it blew over. Bent the top, but I was able to fix it. Otherwise this item is very well put together and the stainless steel looks like it will not rust after time. The controls are easy to use and all the parts fit real good."
2,fire sense deluxe patio heater,"I Initially loved this heater. However, after about 2 weeks the gas knob broke. I tried to contact them. After 10 days , they still have not responded. I do not love something that I can not turn on. If I receive a new knob, I would give this 5 stars."
2,Fire Sense Deluxe Patio Heater - Looks Good ... Doesn't Perform,"I thought we'd done our homework ... reviewed a few types and brands and watched a couple of demonstrations on YouTube. Our Patio Heater assembled easily and looks good but the slightest breeze totally messes up the flame. We live in Kansas by the way, so it's always breezy. To keep the flame inside the grid I have to turn the level down very low and the grid - which is supposed to turn orange from heat and radiate warmth - barely changes color. This thing has been very ineffective for us."
1,"Fire Sense Deluxe Patio Heater, Unpainted Stainless Steel","The aluminum cap is very thin. The material bends VERY easily. The Pilot light system is not reliable. This unit is VERY hard to light even on a zero wind (calm day). The flame adjustment knob movement is cheap. Not solid feel. Would not buy again, and if someone would give me my money back I'd be so pleased. VERY disappointed."
5,Deluxe patio heater,I agree with the other reviewers that this is the patio heater to buy. For the extra money this is a great buy. I really am fond of the shape. This heater not only looks great but works great as well. It is different than many of the others I have seen and I like to have something a little special. We use ours any night that we are outside which has been a lot lately. The heater is holding up well and appears to be of substantial quality. Pleased and proud.
4,"Yellow Leaf, Children's Story","Yellow Leaf is a Cherokee Indian child that gets left behind inadvertantly, on the Trail of Tears. A trapper named ""Cagle"" finds her, and they develop the most incredible bond. I have been trying to find this book for my children to read, I LOVED it as a child. And I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to share the culture of the Cherokee with their child, and the horror of the Trail of Tears. It's sad at times, but heartwarming always."
5,"UNO, DOS, TRES, ROCK!!!",This new release is sick. Melvins/Kyuss/Tool/Sabbath heavilyinfluence these guys. And did I say heavy? Different little birdytweetings separate each song of mental thrash rock these guys injectstraight into the brain. Lovely bass and guitar melodies break it up fora pleasant breather from time to time. This is one of the better newreleases I've heard. Heavily recommended! Jonathan Hay- Concussion Magazine/Issue No. 5
4,Good stuff,Good product. Its not head and shoulders above anything else I've ever used but it is good stuff. I would recommend this polish for newer paint.
4,"Nice product, easy to use.",I use Rejex on the leading edge surfaces of my airplane. Makes removing smashed bugs quite easy.
3,Partial Rejex,"The product does reduce the drudgery of ""bug removal"". However it is not quite the panacea that is cited in other reviews. Ie. the bugs do not come off with the casual wipe of a damp cloth and still do require an auto brush and soap--at least on my RV."
3,"Cute, but won't stay in place","This rug is cute and looks good in my son's nursery. However, even with carpet ""stay in place things"" it slides all around. Also the one braid has come loose after 5 months of use.I gave it 3 stars for cuteness, not for function."
5,"great value, great rug","This is a high quality rug for an amazing price. We bought it for our daughter's nursery and it works just fine. I wish I needed a rug like this in other places in the house, I would buy more.Shipping was very fast, and at a reasonable cost for a rug.One note: the color is not exactly as shown. This appears to be more of a pastel green sage, but the product is actually more of a gray sage. A small discrepancy -- I would have still bought it if I knew -- but worth mentioning."
3,Short Comment,"I've had this cd at one time.There are passages in Daphnis that are spectacular. However, it is not a complete Daphnis...in *part 2* there are selections missing.So sure it is something to listen to indeed, but as a completeist in ravel, I have to hear the score in its entireity.So if you want to hear a certain level of playing unlike any other, then go for it. The nuances are plenty.How i wish this was the complete Daphnis!!!I believe it was recorded just after the war, 1947ish?"
5,NOW YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF NICK JR. SHOWS ALL ON 1 DVD,"Excellent idea! Now you have the option of viewing Dora, Max & Ruby, Little Bill, Blue's Clues and Rugrats episodes all surrounding the subject of spring and summertime activities all on one dvd. I also Have the Nick Jr. Holiday sampler with Dora, Little Bill, Blue's Clues and Rugrats episodes all surrounding the topic of Christmas (Another BIG Hit!!!) Both are excellent to own and I can't wait for them to make more DVD's with this type of variety of Nick Jr. episodes! IF I HAD THE VIDEO VERSION, it would have been WARPED by now because these 2 DVD's get played OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. Thank Heaven for the amount of abuse a DVD can take! A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Bootleg?,This product came with a lot of scratches. The Disk Art seemed to be too large for the acutal disk which makes me believe it was bootleg. Didnt run that well without skipping. Ended up tossing it.
4,DREAMING ABOUT YOU,"THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED. SURPRISED THOUGH THAT NEITHER OF THE TWO BOYS EVER SUGGESTED THEY WERE TAKING CARE OF THEIR FANTASIES THE SUPPOSED TRADITIONAL WAY, UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THAT FIRST SCORE, ESPECIALLY THE CO-STAR WHO GOT OVERLY EXCITED ON TOP OF THAT ROOF, ALTHOUGH HE DID SEEM TO HINT WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO, WHEN THE MAIN PLAYER SHOWED HIM THE PAINTIES. DO BUY THIS MOVIE. ITS WORTH IT."
1,Not yet received,"Well, I have not yet received my items. I am disapointed as the item has not arreived. Order has not been received."
4,"Funny person, book","Someones I wonder if I person is really funny, or is alot of it an act the person places on the screen. I have no doubt Charles Barkley is truely funny, and I don't have any doubts that Bernie Mac is - or maybe, I don't care who he is in real life, and I don't want to find out. He is a funny person, and it shows up in this book."
3,Bernie Mac,"I enjoyed the book to an extent. I like Bernie Mac's wisdom for kids, however, the language was very offensive to me. If the language had not been in there, it would have been the best non-fiction book I've read in a while. I would've given it 5 stars, if the language was toned down. So what if that's the way Bernie talks? What about the rest of us who don't? That's just as real."
4,good read,"i've had this book for i don't know how many years and finally deceided to read it. i thought this was a really good read. he didn't let anyone or anything hold him down, worked hard at whatever job he could get and didn't turn his nose up at a job. he took whatever was available, which is a good lesson for lots of men these days. he did what he had to do to take care of his family. the stories about his friends and how he got started were funny, i found myself chuckling every now and then. you learned things about him that you would've never known and he talked about how his certain catch phrases got started. he will forever be missed."
1,Too vague and outdated!,"This book may have been good reading in the early 90's, but now it is only good if you are interested in reading about the good-ole-days of BBS's and 9600 baud modems. A little too anecdotal and vague for anyone interested in learning about the true methods of a hacker. For real info, read phrack: http://www.phrack.com"
3,"Dated, but entertaining","The book is entertaining, but it was written for a completely different era. This book can no longer be seriously accepted as a guide to computer hacking. If you know what a dial-up BBS was, you may be entertained by the stories within. If you're an old-timer techie, you may be amused with how the Knightmare describes how to repair a 5 1/4 inch disk; slice it open and place the magnetic material inside of a fresh disk. Other than the nostalgia, I do like how the book emphasizes hacker ethics, and the friendly pursuit of knowledge. If anything useful is to be gleaned from it besides that, it would be the segment on the lost art of social engineering. The book does not mention Unix, or the Internet.Simply put, this book may be entertaining, but is no longer useful."
3,"Good read, no useful technical info","To start, this text was published in 1994. I've read this book several time.Yes, it's outdated. The author him/herself notes that any real technical info would be outdated quickly. A lot of the social engineering advice is *STILL* useful. There are still plenty of people who will do silly, silly things that experts would facepalm over.The anecdotes are interesting, and provide some insight into an older ""spirit"" of hacking -- one of exploration and learning.One of the things that have stuck with me that came from this book was a statement of the reason that makes hacking/cracking/etc possible: ""Anything a human mind can achieve, so can another."""
1,re: Contents of the Book,"I read this book and I am glad I never bought it. I learned more by googling than here. A lot of this stuff is common sense, as if whoever wrote this was watching Hackers and Sneakers (both are movies)."
1,TROJAN LAND,"This book talks about trojan land when we had our Atari computers. I remember those days when very few knew what trojans were. Dude talks about sneaking on site and installing trojans and backdoors. Yeah, try doing that at Chase Manhattan Bank or Microsoft. See you in the slammer. Trojans land is over. Anyone can get a trojan and infect a Windows sytem, look through all their files. Trojans are known about by most people today. Maybe they don't know how to use them, but once I teach them, they say, ""Wow, this is easy!"" Word to the wise, this book is written for kids who liked Wargames back in the 80s. Check it off teaching you anything. If you want a nice laugh and discover those Pac-man days once again, go for it man! Maybe you can bring back the Regan Presidency. Least the Iran Contra was better than the Iraq war. It was all peace and love back then, and everyone drove a nice car."
2,Maybe for technophobes...,"All this book ever touches upon is hacking theory. Which is mostly common sense among the computer literate. When describing how to create a simulated logon screen, the knightmare includes the code (in BASIC, hah!) on how to print to screen and take input from the keyboard. Then uses remarks to tell you to save it to a file and send an error message, the most difficult part of the program (although still not at all difficult). Such half-baked examples plague this book and are much more common than any other usefull information."
2,"It's got a little good information, but it's mostly BS.","This book had some information that was useable, but most of it was just common sense. The other information was completely spurious. If you can discern between the two, it could be an educational book."
3,Good book for it's time--needs an Internet update,"Current reviewers aren't taking this book in context. It was published in 1994 just before the Internet explosion and just at the end of BBS' heyday. For the uniformed, it provides insight into how hackers gain access to systems and a generic idea of how an individual can render a system vulnerable.I'd like a see a similar book published updated for today's Internet environment. I bought this book shortly after it was published and just came back to it this week. In 1994, it seemed quite informative, but it appears merely quaint today."
4,I like this book,"Regardless of what anyone says, I say this book kicks ass. Its a book. It can't go into every detail on hacking. The guy who wrote this book is the most well known hacker on this planet. I heard his name before I heard of the book. The name of the book isn't what drew me to it, it was the name of the author on the front cover. If you want details go buy books on SPECIFIC SOFTWARE."
1,This book isn't for anyone!,"First of all i would like to point out that i read the book in a day! And that was about the slowest day of my life. I have come to the conclusion that this book isn't for anyone! First off if you are a ""hacker"" and you bought this book and followed the tips and thought they were helpful then you need to look up the word Hacker in the InterNet dictionary---then look up lamer---Get my drift! And for the general public who read this book it will give the wrong impression about us. But don't worry ppl the only people who actually bought and use the book for a guide are no threat to society they most likely have names like AcidBurn, ZeroCool, and CrashOveride, and they hang out in local IRC and or AOL chatrooms talking to other lamers about hacking the ""Gibson"". As for me i will stick to my UNIX Bible, NSA's Trusted networks, and my Man pages and my Linux and SunOS mans. I wouldn't suggest this book for anyone!!! BTW i slapped my friend who bought it and gave it to me!!!"
1,Not worth paper printed on...,I believe that this book is not worth the paper that it is printed on. ALL of the information included in this book can be easily found on the internet. Much of the information is very vague and for the most part just points out the obvious. I truly believe that this author's bigest Hack was to actually convince someone to publish this JUNK.
1,The book is for newbies and is outdated.,"Secrets of a Super Hacker is a complete waste of time. Anyone with some basic knowledge of computers would not even benefit one bit from reading it. The only reason that it got a 2 from me was because of the content. Yes, some of the content may be good, but it is very basic. You might like the book if you're a complete newbie to the subject only because it walks you through everything step by step."
1,Superhacker? Hardly!,I have been hacking since they invented the term and I have worked as a systems administrator and professional C programmer. I know just about all there is to know about hacking and any true hacker would agree that Knightmare is a novice whose methods are outdated and whose techniques are laughable. There is nothing to learn from this book.
1,Don`t waste your money!,"I borrowed this book on a library.As it was made 1994 I thought it could tell me about real hacking.I was wrong.I was stupid enough not to realize that this book was out of date,so I went around speaking about modem-hacking and brute force for a while,until I got smart. This is good trivia,but not a book for today.Sorry........."
3,Ok but not the best,I don't like the translation as pardo is not a word that I think most people in the US would use. Also this book just doesn't keep her attention like some others that she has.
3,"great story, terrible format","we have the english version, which is a board book. my son loves the book. so we got it in spanish so i could read it to him (my husband talks to him in english and i talk to him in spanish). i was disappointed in the format. it's hard cover, with paper pages. plus it has a glossy paper cover over the hard cover. how is a toddler suppose to handle that?! so what i did was that i memorized the spanish version and use the english board book with him. so when i'm ""reading"" him the english board book, i'm reciting the memorized spanish version.and i have one knock on the translation. pardo for brown? i've never heard that word. it's not in mexican spanish (i use cafe). our nanny is peruvian and she's never heard it either (she uses maron)."
5,Gran traducción de un libro clásico,Recordaremos siempre al abuelo leer a su nieta este libro (en español) cuando ella era un bebé. Teniendo un libro en inglés y español es una gran manera de tender un puente sobre idiomas y las generaciones.
2,routine,"The pieces in this collection are a cut above the pieces you find in other weeklies, like New York magazine, but they suffer in comparison to ""fact"" pieces published during the Shawn administration. A lot of these pieces were obviously written in a hurry, and the haste is evident. David Remnick is a capable editor, but he's not a genius. Shawn was a genius."
3,Entertaining Hope Vehicle,"A nice change of pace from the usual Bob Hope formula, ""The Seven Little Foys"" (1955) is a lively biopic with spirited performances and vibrant Technicolor photography. The tabletop dance with Hope and James Cagney (reprising George M. Cohan) is one of the Great Movie Moments. However, the film should be reissued on DVD in its original VistaVision format."
3,"Great costumes, sonderful dancing, and a few laughs","I'd read the previous reviews of this movies and saw it this weekend. While it was entertaining, it wasn't as funny as I'd anticipated. The story line was pretty weak too.On the other hand... The costumes were spectacular, and it was worth seeing the movie just for that!I was amazed as how great a dancer Bob Hope was! The table top dance duet with James Cagney was absolutely brilliant!This isn't really a musical in the sense that people don't suddenly burst into song. But, there is a lot of music, dance, and vaudvillian routines."
3,"Great costumes, wonderful dancing, and a few laughs","I'd read the previous reviews of this movies and saw it this weekend. While it was entertaining, it wasn't as funny as I'd anticipated.

3,The Seven Little Foys,The Seven Little Foys DVD is a great and entertaining show. I recommened it to everyone. I did not get to completely see the DVD due to a flaw in the disc. I shot an email to my seller and I was graciously refunded my money. They were delightful to do business with.
5,A book not for the faint of heart!,The book was well written. Nan Ryan is a great author. The book as I siad though is not for the faint of heart. The story makes u want to drop everything and read it. I recommend this book to all who like historical romances. Great book u gotta read it.
2,Surprised by the great reveiws!,"What I look for in a book is three stars for plot, 1 star for sex and 1 star for the Charisma of the couples relationship. This book got the 1 star for sex, and it was hot, steamy and plentiful, especially in the second half of the book... too plentiful for me, really. It barely got the 1 star Charisma for their relationship (but I liked the painful young love in the beginning of the book), and it missed totally my three stars for plot, it didn't have one... only wronged lovers coming back together. It sure wasn't a 5 star quality book for me. If you are into lots of steamy sex, this will be a great book for you but if you like more of a 'meaty' plot with a little less 'meaty' sex, give this book a pass or get it at your library."
5,Surprised to learn about the Haitian Composer,"""I shared your CD with the family--everyone liked it and was surprised to learn about the Haitian Composer. Do you have any other CD's on the market?If so I would like to order them and have them for my family reunion inJuly.""Elvin (Texas)"
5,Not Just a good novelist,"Greene is a master of the short essay. He's a particularly good book reviewer, with tastes ranging from Rider Haggard to Henry James. He is, in fact, particularly fine on James, which is somewhat surprising, since at first glance they wouldn't seem to have much in common. They both, however, were deeply concerned with the craft of fiction, and it is that interest in craftmanship, more so than Greene's political or religious views, which dominates these essays."
5,twelve great melodies!!,"Man, I've got to agree with everybody who told me to find this CD. I'm really into melodies, and this guy writes the best! Kyf and Jumpin' Dave are kings! Not sure which direction this guy is most comfortable with, but, hey, most one-directional albums get boring halfway through, anyway. Not this one - I love every song. Heard you guys on the radio and had to find ya. By the way, it's ""SalvaDOR Deli"", to the person who reviewed it last - great title! If you read this review, Kyf, you da man! Keep up the good work!!"
2,Tokina 3x telephoto lens,"Great delivery from the camera shop to NZ.Unfortunately, the results with a canon G6 are not acceptable: A dark ring is around all images, even on full zoom.It should not be sold as being compatable with the Canon G6.I tried it on a Fuji S3000: good resultsAlso on a Canon 52mm SLR lens: excellent results.The lens quality is superb, but caution as to which camera it is used on."
4,American Pie,It was an ok book. Not your fault that I didn't completely love it. Another required book for a book club.
2,Falls Short,"The prior six issues of Ripper Notes, I recommend. The last issue I gave five stars. There are usually half a dozen really good articles. This issue.... none. I believe it was thrown together."
5,Secrets to Drawing Realistic Faces,This book was recommended to me by someone who is an artists for crime victims. It was used in the classes she went to. I am practicing drawing eyes at the moment. I have to say that I am now drawing the best eyes ever. This book explains more that where to put the features. It explains how to make the features come to life.
1,LOL.,"How disappointing that the only Black person in this book is of a Criminal and the rest is of white men and woman and children laughing. I suppose the Author just couldn't help but to put 1 Black picture of a criminal. I mean why use any Black people at all if that's the case? And seriously, let's be serious how many Black people are actually in Idaho, I'm more than sure the majority of your criminals there were white."
1,Should be called Study in Great Britain for Dummies,"Having studied for two years in a non-English speaking country, I found that this book was extremely weak in presenting issues of study abroad in very different countries. I thought the title of the chapter ""Daring to be Different: The British University System"" was particularly laughable. It would have been better to have a more well-rounded author, or let this author write a specialty book from her own narrow experience."
4,You need to re-check your facts...,"First Rob Feinstein was 'fired' by ROH, he is the co-founder and still had a major part in the company after his public role ended. Secondly he was never fired from RF Video seeing as he is the owner and founder....look at the intials genius.Now, this DVD is exceptional, with great action, with a price that can't be beat. I recommend it to any wrestling, or even non wrestling fan."
1,ROH RUN BY CHILD MOLESTOR!!!!,"RING OF HONOR is a BUSH LEAGUE fed run by ROB FEINSTEIN, a CHILD MOLESTOR.Local news ran a story on him and how he goes after little boys. ALl this can be proven if you do any net search.the ROH Product is an ECW RIPOFF!!!!"
1,A big disappointment,"Ms. Jayanti is big on the history of tarot cards and obviously a psychology buff. She interprets the cards as a psychologist might see Rohrschach ink blots. ""I don't work with the tarot to predict the future,"" she says.Tarot is a great teaching tool for substance-abuse counselors, according to this author. She lets the client do the interpreting of the cards as pretty pictures, much as a psychiatrist might ask a patient to interpret ink blots.This author calls it a ""fallacy"" that some think tarot readings help you find out about your future. To her, the cards are merely a symbol system that can assist you in understanding yourself -- and you can forget about predictive readings for others. ""Lighting candles or saying prayers"" to her is ""just plain ignorant.""I'll take a book that tells me how to read the cards. If I want psychoanalysis, I'll go to a psychiatrist."
1,I wouldnt recomend it,"I guess I thought this book would have more to do with reading tarot cards and card meanings instead of a long history/symbology lesson. I understand that the cards are symbols that everyone sees differently but did she have to be so vague about EVERYTHING? I felt this book was more about Qabala than the cards themselves. And if your going to write a book for ""dummies"" try not making it so complicated. I bought this book three years ago and honestly got about a 3rd of the way through and put it and the deck away. Two days ago I decided to force myself to read the whole book. I understood what she was saying I just thought it should have been more card related information."
2,I tried to like this book....,"I really, really tried to. I just couldn't get into it. The author was kinda preachy for my taste. There was a lot of information on Qabala and mystery schools, which I didn't think went well with a book for begining tarot readers. She doesn't really believe or care that much about card reversals. Is this to save the space or was it too hard to explain to us ""dummies""? I read the whole book, but it took forever because I couldn't get into it. I've read many other tarot books, and I would reccommend any of them over this one. If you feel you have to read it, please check it out of the library or borrow from someone else. I found very little useful information here, and all that I did find was available in better books."
1,Possible side effects,"The product worked to minimize my hot flashes and night sweats, but I ended up with an unbelievable migraine as a side effect. I went to my doctor and he said that sometimes this happens to women who try to treat the menopausal symptoms with products that contain black cohash and soy. He said I could try to play with the dosage to see if I can get any benefit with a smaller amount of the product but my goal right now is to get rid of these awful headaches so I just stopped taking it. I may try again, every other day when the headache goes away completely."
1,Not effective for me,"I wanted a cheaper substitution for Remifemin so I tried Natrol Complete Balance, alas my hot flashes and night sweats returned with a vengeance.I am left with 2.5 months of a useless product. I have to go out and buy Remifemin because I cannot wait until I can have some delivered by Amazon.It may work for some people but sadly not for me."
4,"School Days"" Frame",This is a very nice frame but the product description said a picture from every year of your child's schooling. I guess they think kindergarten is not part of school! I was not happy to find out that the pictures start at first grade not kindergarten. It was a surprise when I opened the frame.
5,School Days Frame,This frame came package and in excellent shape. It's very good way to show off your children or grandchildren's school pictures except it doesn't have room for pre-school picture.
5,Be smart,"This stuff will truly help your workout, but be smart about it. It does have creatine in it, which I could write pages about. But if you live off this stuff it will stop having the same affect. For maximum results take for 1 month, then take one month off from all supplements except protein. You need to let your body get all that stuff out. Be patient and wait. That second month will be intense, but great results by the third. Trust me."
2,"Does what it says, but hurts your body","I purchased this item a few months ago, and have been using it 3 times a week (on average) and only one scoop per time. The workouts were good, and vascularity increased, however, after one month, I started having pain using the product and eventually I had to stop it completely as my doctor indicated that it was harming my digestive system. I'm sure that others have used it with no issues, however, it did not work out for me."
3,iTS OK,This product really gets me pumped up to do my workout but does not sit well wit hmy stomach. I found my self running t othe bathroom each time around an hour after taking the powder.
2,tastes like bad cough medicine.,"I personally think the fruit punch flavor tastes like bad cough medicine. i much prefer the grape flavor over this one, and, of course, they doesn't offer the grape flavor, the watermelon or sour apple. Target has the grape flavor in stock, but it costs $$ more per box."
3,Bad tasting,I used to use jack3d. It was way better and had a great flavor. It used to be illegal in the US as i was in Canada but i'm going to try and get my hands on it once i muscle through this.
4,Good stuff,"i take this about about 2o minutes before i work out and i have to say i dont plan on ever working out without something like this again! Gave me that extra kick somebody lazy like me needs to workout for an extended period of time. i dont have any problem with the taste, just mix with ice and water and its actually good to me. Iam able to lift about 10 more lbs than i normally could and definitely have more stamina after taking this. Only negatives are there is alot ! of caffeine in it, you probably shouldn't take it less than 4 hours before you go to sleep. Its a pretty clean feeling to me though and there is definitely more helping you than just caffeine (but i think caffeine is a big part of it)Probably not good for your kidenys for an extended period of time."
3,It's OK,"I am a woman who tries this product with weight training workouts. It works, but I have had better products. The BSN CELLMASS is awesome, but this sisterly product isn't as mind blowing."
2,It just did not work for me,A lot of guys at the gym use this so I gave it a try ...but it did not work for me at all I will use it up but so far not a thing ..not to say it's bad ..just not for me ..just sayin
4,Good for what it's meant for,"After trying a few other pre-workout products, we came back to NO-xplode. It tastes much better than the other we tried and you can really feel the kick of energy. It does tend to upset stomachs if you take too much, so I only use half a scoop.Wish we could find something healthier with the same effects..."
5,Awesome Energy,"Nearly instant energy coupled with sustained power throughout the workout whether running, cycling or lifting weights. The other huge benefit is increased perceived awareness, alertness and clarity of mind. Great product."
2,Tastes Terrible,"This stuff really works if you can get past the taste. There are tasteless version of this you can get and put in a recovery shake. I would go that route if you can. This basically hydrates your muscles and allows them to expand. If you use this during a work out it will help your muscles grow, but I couldnt take it long enough to comment on the type of results to expect. ended up giving what I had left away. it also doesnt mix well in water, you would need like a blender or something, otherwise it clumps, and the taste...."
2,No noticeable effect,"Compared to cough syrup it doesn't taste bad but by no means does it taste good. Two times it blew the lip off my shaker bottle when mixing (even after a very modest couple of shakes; yes the lid was secure)--just a little scary to think I was now going to drink this combustible cocktail. Bottom line: I stopped the coffee to ensure I was gauging the correct result/effects but to my disappointment I experienced no clear effect whatsoever. No burst of energy, no focus--nothing. Good news is I didn't get sick like some peeps. Bad news is I dumped about $25 in left over product in the trash. Perhaps the three scoops wasn't enough but I wasn't willing to stomach any more of the sickly sweet drink. Perhaps I'm just not hardcore enough. All I do know is that I won't be trying it again."
5,No Xplode,I got the item as indicated on the website. It has been useful in my workouts. I have used it for a year now and really like the concentration and great workout energy/stamina it provides. Of course you need to read the labels and be aware of what it says. Taking a month off or so after using for a while is a good idea. Helps your body not completely rely on the stuff. But I really like this product.
3,Missing Something,makes you feeeel good.. great energy rush without the jitters. have used for years. needs a little bump though. feels like they have taken something out of the formula.
1,"Very dangerous, Unhealthy, deadly...","I had bought this tub three weeks ago, used a scoop for each drink as directed for three days, then the following week and for three days, used one tea spoon (because the full scoops before cause me a lot of pain during #2. It caused extreme burning in my colon (through stool), and internal bleeding and discomfort for a week. I have been lifting weights for four years, used many products for pre-training and post training made by other companies, but this one is like others say, is not something you want to kill your self with. I'm planning on suing BSN for this crap they sell. We all know their athletes who sell these products use steroids, eat and exercise well, none of them will want to put these flammable unhealthy products in their system."
2,No effect....,"I wish I could say this product has worked or had any effect, but for me I really don't notice much difference in how I feel, any pump,etc...I have been following the directions. I'm pretty sure I ordered fruit punch, instead I got grape, which is not very tasty. The positive here is that it mixes real well."
2,works sometimes,Pros: Tastes great. Doesn't upset stomach.Cons: Only really gives you the kick about 30% of the time. Expensive. I feel light headed for about an hour after taking it. Will not buy again.
1,Awful,"It really doesn't give me more energy when I am working out, although it does seem to make me less tired and sore after my workout. The taste is what is making me give it 1 star. The taste is so awful it makes me gag, and it makes you not want to take it. I talked to a guy at GNC and he said Jack 3d works alot better, and it tastes like kool aid so I am going to buy some of that...."
3,Beware those with weak stomachs,"I used to be a heavy lifter who would only use protein shakes as supplements. After a few shoulder and knee injuries I stopped lifting and gained quite a bit of fat. About 6 months ago I started working out again but not heavy lifting as much. I started taking NOxplode about a month agoPros: I've never been able to work out this hard and for this long. my workout consisted of about a 3.5 mile jog then various dumbbell and body control exercises.Cons: My digestive track is having a rather obvious problem with this product. It seems regular that I will have to wait an hour after taking it so that I can get to the restroom without destroying my pants with not just doo doo.I will not be taking this supplement anymore as I was only taking up to 1.5 scoops of it and having serious digestive issues. If they can figure that out I will definitely be coming back to this product. I gave it 3 stars only because I'm hoping they fix that issue, doubtful."
4,"Great product, but read the label carefully...","I totally love NO-Xplode for the energy, focus and pumps it gives me prior to and during my workout. My only concern is the amount of caffeine in each scoop (approximately 100mg). If you're caffeine sensitive, this stuff could possibly give ya headaches, the shaves, anxiety and increased blood pressure. Ease in slow by taking one scoop when first trying this product. Just a precaution to potential side affects."
1,This is 2.0 NOT 1.0 and NOT eligible for return...,"I wanted to buy some original NO-XPLODE to compare it to the 2.0 version. This is NOT the original version and is NOT eligible for return. The description says ""2.25 lb"" in some places and ""2.0 lb (820 g)"" in others... apparently I was supposed to guess that ""2.0 lb"" means NO-XPLODE 2.0"
1,Hate No Xplode,"This stuff makes me crash HARD. So hard. About half an hour into my workout I become fatigued and sleepy. This stuff really sucks. At first I really liked this and it worked really well for my workouts, but I quickly built up a tolerance. I didn't even finish the tub of this because I found it to be completely useless and actually made my workouts and energy level worse than if I were to work out without it.Don't suggest it at all."
2,Watch the taste,The product is ok but it tastes like unsweetened Sweet-tarts awful yuck.....If anyone has any suggestions on how to make this product taste better I am all ears.
5,Crazy product.,"First time I took it my body felt weird and I could stop shaking. Never really use more than one scoop per day.Most definitely gives you a stronger lift and a drug or redbull style energy.Would recommend to take when you plateau on the gym or any other sport. Another warning would be not to take it too often, read about NO - nitrous oxide and you will understand why."
4,Excellent Outcome So Far,"So far after using NO Xplode for about 2 weeks I feel myself able to do more reps and lift more weight while at the gym. I havent felt any negative side effects yet, but while it apperas ok I'm likely going to get test done after about a month to be on the safe side, and would advise everyone else to do the same."
5,works for me,"I've been using x-plode for like 9 months and its the best thing I've ever taken. It gives me all the energy I need. I do more reps and i stay in the gym longer. I even run on the treadmill longer. It makes me burp a little though and if i take too much scoops i get a stomache ache. one scoop is enough for me. it makes me go to the bathroom too but once you get that out the way, its nothing but energy from then on."
1,Read Product Description CAREFULLY!,"It's not advanced or more powerful it is the old product 1.0so it is the same old stuff, not new 2.0"
3,Good but not Excelent,"I used this product for 6 months aprox. It did give me more strengh, resistance and energy just not as much as i spected (given some of the reviews i read here) that depends on your level of tolerance i think. It's worth trying it, but don't spect superman power.And if the first one doesn't give you the performance you expect, belive me, the second, third, etc. wont either.HC"
1,the worst business,"I had to return this item as it was not possible to get in my country.- As a surprise now they claim the package has no been returned although it was returned to the same address the day after it got to my courier!!!!I spent $32 of nothing.-Amazon should take care of better suppliers, as I've been Amazon customer for several years and this doesnt felt good.-"
3,Okay if you are comfortable with LOADS of caffeine,"I have taken this product before a few waterpolo games, practices, and when I hit the gym... And damn, I feel unstoppable, but strange at the same time. While I have enough energy to swim, and drowned anyone that I have to guard, I usually feel really itchy and end up itching everywhere... so everyone thinks that Im on meth, HAHAHAHA!Anyway, id say this product is good for OCCASIONAL use, and thats about it."
3,Has CONS and PROS...,"PROS:- PUMP- Never get Tired- My muscles feel like they are gonna xplode!- Mix well- Doesn't taste bad - Fruit punch flavor- Doesn't need to take the full serving size (I only take half)CONS:- Can't sleep -> HUGE CONS- PriceI usually have trouble to sleep, which is normal on me, maybe cause I suffer from anxiety attacks. But this thing, how can I explain... If I take this thing on other time than the morning I just can't sleep. I feel like my heart is beating too fast at night, and I feel even more anxious, like I have smoked tons of cigars, and drank red-bull and viagra at the same time. Also gave me soft headaches when I tried to close my eyes and rest. Oh, also your libido goes pretty down, 'cause of the anxiety."
3,gassy but works,hahah it works but leave me with a bloated feeling with a lot of gas. I took me a while to get used to it. You can definitely feel the pump for the first 40 minutes then it is downhill after that.
4,May not be good for people with anger management problems,"I have been using this for about a month now. It will give you a slight but noticeable boost in the gym, but there are already enough reviews about that. One thing to be careful of is that it will increase your aggressiveness. You will sometimes find yourself being angry for no reason after taking it. It may not be good for people with anger management problems or who are prone to road rage."
3,Kinda iffy,When I first started this product I was like holy cow!!! I had some awesome pumps. I began to up the dose but I never felt the same after the first week using this.. Kinda bummed but it helped to get my vains showing better. I took this with the Nitrix also
3,N.O. XPLODE,"If you like Xenadrine than you'll like N.O. Xplode. I did not care for it. Reason being, after taking N.O. Xplode it felt as if I could not catch my breath leaving me feeling faint. The poduct did not make me feel any stronger it just gave me a negative type of energy. If anyone decides to use this product, eat a little something just before you take the product. Saying that, I know it deviates from the directions but it will take the edge off the jittery effects."
3,Good but with some reservations,"If you get tired during the work-out and are looking for a supplement that keeps you focused and provides enough energy to get you through then it is a great stuff. And Fruit Punch tastes pretty good too. But then its goodness is limited to just that. I didn't feel any difference in my strength etc. It doesn't give you any burst of power but a steady dose of energy so its effect is more apparent towards the end of your workout session. When I realized this, I started using it judiciously and not everyday (including non-training days!) as the recommendation on it reads. I take it on days I'm training large muscle groups like legs and back to help me finish a relatively longer workout with many compound exercises.Hope it helps."
1,Not worth it!,"Don't buy this garbage! I took it as prescribed and became dizzy, lightheaded and felt nautious. In addition, there was ZERO energy spike and it just left me feeling sick! What a waste of money and the taste is downright awful! I know people react to products differently and I was exrtemely disappointed!"
3,I am not sure yet,I am a woman and I bought this product because I have been getting tired during my workouts and needed a boost. I'm strength training and doing cardio to loose some weight. So far I have noticed a slight increase in my energy level during a workout but it also made me sick to my stomach. I'm going to try taking it after a protein shake and see what happens.
4,"works well, but...","It does what it says, gives muscle pumps and adds umph to your workout. But, it does at a price: you feel like your wired for hours; it needs to pointed out that there is a lot of caffiene in this product."
5,Can't train without it,I have used this product for the last seven weeks with AMAZING results. I have gained 20 lbs quickly. The only side-effect has been mild heartburn while running. This product is well-worth trying for weight training.The fruit punch is easily the best flavor.
5,Amazon's prices for N.O. Xplode are tough to beat!,"Great Product and Great Price! Amazon's price combined with a Prime Membership is the way to go on this product.I find N.O. Xplode to be the best pre-workout product on the market. If taken first thing in the morning 1/2 or 45 minutes before a workout, it satisfies the morning hunger, gets the blood flowing, and makes you want to focus. Take that to the gym, and you'll have amazing results."
4,BSN N.O. Xplode works.,"This site is much cheaper then GNC. Product works well, but bother your stomach if not taken on an empty stomach."
5,Used for years,And YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS PRICE. A willingness to wait a few days for it to arrive = a huge cost savings.
5,No-xplode Product,works well to get me through my workouts. Gives me a lot of extra energy. Eat well before you use this product though.
1,This is not the new No2!,"This is NOT the new No2!!! NO-Xplode was good, but Jack3d is better. The new NO-Xplode 2.0. is even better than Jack3d. SO don't fall for this like I did and order this OLD NO-Xplode unless that is what you want. Very disappointing."
3,Not for newbie cooks!,"It's quite the bible of food and cooking. I found the explanation of certain food groups and handling helpful. For example, what types of meat are from what parts of animals, and the oils and consistencies differ.But as a newbie cook, I found little joy and little cooking. It's a good reference book, but much too intimidating. There's not enough beginner-type of explanations of cooking terminology or food prep techniques (nor are there pictures to help out)."
1,Miniscule worthless book,"Although most of the Joy of the Cooking books contain strong, solid recipes and useful hints, this tiny book is a joke. Most of the info is so basic that it offends those of us who know how to boil water. There are scant recipes and and the book is so incredibly small that it takes two hands just to open the awkward sized book."
1,not what you would expect,"I thought this would be a miniature version of the Joy of Cooking.It's not. Not useful at all, and not worth purchasing"
1,Never buy the Miniature Edition,"I bought this book and I didn't know it was the miniature edition. I'm very disappointed, but if I return it I have to pay to send it back. I'm keeping it in case someone else wants it."
1,Scam,Imagine trying to cook from a recipe book like The Joy of Cooking in a miniature smaller than a deck of cards. That's what you get with this digital slight of hand product. Buyer beware.
1,joy of cooking,very dissapointed in this minature version of this classis cookbook. I thought I was ordering a regular full sized joy of cooking. I saw nothing when ordering that indicated that this would be a minature (a joke perhaps). I'm concerned about returning it as I may be charged again and then have about 9 dollars wrapped up in shipping charges and no book. You've given me cold feet about ordering from Amazon again. Ken
5,IT WORKS!,I waited until something happened until I wrote a review because I was skeptical. To my surprise I've discovered 3 sprouts today hopefully more will follow...
3,Wrong picture,"This product is not at all what they show in the picture, but in fact, what turned out to be the kit I had bought before. I only bought this one because I thought that it might be an improvement on the one I had, but it was the EXACT SAME THING. Hopefully the tree will turn out better than last time, but if you are hoping for what is in the picture, don't count on it."
2,"""digitally enhanced' as in who do they think they're fooling!?!","""Now, I am only just beginning to read this book and it's very frustrating, ""Forgotten Books' Classic Repint Series utilizes the latest technology to regenerate facsimiles of historically important writings. Careful attention has been made to accurately preserve the original format of each page whilst digitally enhancing the quality of the aged text.""is the claim, the reality is that this volume is made up of poorly scanned pages at larger than 100% size in effect to read this book is to struggle with tenuous 18 point text with holes in it printed not even in black more like a grey. It's a trial and an error and a drag and a sham a scam in short a rip off. But where else can I find an English langage version of Goncourt's ""La Faustin"" which was such an important book to Wilde and I think maybe to Huysmans as well.Booo! I'll definitely do without the next time I can only find a [...] edition of some rare writing I hoped to peruse!"
2,Trophy Bass 2,"Ordered this for grandson as he liked Trophy Bass. However, I would not order ""2"" of any computer game again. Did not know that Trophy Bass 2 would override Trophy Bass on computer. Therefore, he cannot play the original game."
4,Marching through Sweden,"When searching for marches, you might not look to Sweden first, but the Royal Swedish Air Force Band does a creditable and energetic job with this compilation of march tunes. Twenty different composers are represented, many of them unfamiliar to the listener whose march experience begins and ends with Sousa, but all are excellent representatives of the march genre. Most pieces seem like straightforward renditions of the original scores, but I had a slight quibble with a quirky arrangement of Herbert's ""March of the Toys"". That should not dissuade any listener; this is an excellent cross-section of march selections from Schubert's ""March Militaire"" to more modern composers like Gershwin and Coates."
1,Not too good,"What's up with Lonely Planet? Their new titles have been stinking for the last couple of years. This book wasn't very well researched. The Haiti section was very bare bones, and the Dominican Republic section was okay, but missed out on most of the best nightlife spots in Santo Domingo, some of the best beaches, didn't cover large sections of the country. I was really disappointed."
2,The Dominican Republic & Haiti,"I try to buy used books, which this was, but I didn't realize this book was about 10 years old, so any of the guidance it had to travel about the DR was probably no good. That said, this is not the vendors fault, the vendor was very good, and shipped promptly, This review is says it is for the item so I want to be clear that it what is getting to low rating, not the seller"
2,Haiti - an afterthought?,Dominican Republic coverage was ok but Haiti seemed very ill served by this book.
2,all prices are wrong,"all prices are wrong, example:a language school that was recommended for 375$/month turned out to cost 1500$ a month. it appears that the author has never visited the most of the locations he wrote about! muchas gracias"
1,Is Lonely Planet Slipping,I have been a great fan of the Lonely Planet guides for years and have used them in Central America and Australia and places that I have just dreamed of going. But this one seems to be written by people who were just afraid to travel or only spent a week here. I have lived in the DR for two years now and once lived in Haiti. Sorry ' LP' I think perhaps your reporters are getting a bit soft. Where is my beloved guide to the world of toilet-seats-optional hotels. This one even rates some of the VERY pricey all inclusive resorts that are just Cancun. My former LP guides would not even include these monsters. Yup -the Rough Guide is better.
4,It's Perfect for First Time Travellers to the Dominican R.,"This book is a well written book that I really enjoyed. Even though at times I felt the book was a bit negative on some issues, over all it's great. It clearly post the different points of interests, restaurants, accommodations across the Dominican Republic. It gives some good detailed history of the country. I don't think the book did as good of a job with the Haiti section but the Dominican Republic section is stellar. Anyone travelling to the D.R. should not leave prior to buying this book!"
1,Teapot Has Spider Cracks,"I ordered this teapot for my English wife for Christmas. In less than 2 months of use, the teapot and the lid have developed spider cracks all over the teapot. At the present rate of progression, I think the teapot will fall apart within two months. And Amazon will not replace their defective merchandise since more than 30 days have passed since delivery.We are not happy customers."
3,Brown Betty OK,"The brown Betty looks good, is a bit heavy but this may be the characteristic of the clay used.The top seems loose, a little sloppy in comparison to my old Brown Betty bought about 10 or more years ago. I like the large capacity. I would have liked a strainer inside spout area; there was no mention of this feature in the pots I looked at on line. Would be fun if they offered a cozy with the pot. My regular ones are a bit snug for this large pot. I do use it daily and generally like it."
1,Disaster for sure,"This teapot was a disaster and a disappointment.Even while handling it with care, warming it before pouring boiling water into it, never putting it into the dishwasher, etc., IT CRACKED!Yes, within 2 weeks of receiving it, it showed hairline cracks and then split along those cracks.It has to have been made of inferior quality products and I would not recommend it to anyone!Do not waste your money!"
3,be careful - may be wrong version,"this is a great book, at least in it's original form. i first saw it in the doctor's office. our pediatrician says that it's his favorite kids' book. however, the 2 copies I received from amazon were a shorter version, only 24 pages. in this shorter version, the action ends abruptly with the house in a mess. in the real version (30 pages - the one that's advertised here) there is a final verse in which the animals hurriedly clean the house before the parents come home. make sure you get that one!"
3,An adapted version?,"My 11 month old loves her Wheels On The Bus book and as much as I love singing it to her 20 times a day, I'd like to have other options in our library! Skip To My Lou is a classic song but this version in the book is not quite the original. I'm not sure how to even sing the first 2 pages: Sitting on the front porch, painted like new. The farm's all in order, there's not much to do. Take care of the farm. We'll be back by two!"" And yes, just like all the other reviewers said, there are pages missing at the end so the story just ENDS..."
3,Ending spoils the book,"This is a well-written page-turner. Yet the characters, once you discover their motivations, are fairly one-dimensional: pretty near everyone is a ""goodie"" or a ""baddie."" Not much complexity or soul-searching among the characters.Also, the ending (which I won't reveal), is such a wildly impossible out-of-the-blue deus ex machina invention that it destroys any delusion the reader may have had that the author was writing about realistic events and characters."
3,A solid read and enjoyable,"This is a good, solid read. Michael Palmer's story about a female doctor who moves to a town with her fiance. She is employed in the emergency room and comes across patients tht she has no idea what is happening to them. At the same time her fiance is showing indications of the same thing and she wonders if his employer could somehow be involved. Then, the rest of the story.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Keeps you guessing,"As always, Mr. Palmer wrote a highly suspenseful and entertaining novel. Keeps you guessing till the end!"
4,"Good, but not his best.","I am a big Michael Palmer fan. I've read all of his books and although I found this book to be very interesting, I thought it took too long to build up to where it was headed (though the last quarter of the book flew by). Don't get me wrong, it is a very enjoyable read and I would recommend it to fans of medical thrillers. It has interesting characters and a nicely thought out plot, but I just felt like something was missing."
3,Disappointing thriller,"Having previously read and enjoyed Michael Palmer's CRITICALJUDGMENT, I looked forward to hearing the taped version ofSILENT TREATMENT . . . the premise sounded great, too . . . aninvestigative journalist dies the night before she is scheduled forroutine surgery . . . it is later discovered that she had been close toexposing a murderous cost-cutting conspiracy among medicalinsurance companies, wherein someone is paying to have thecostliest patients murdered . . . but after a great beginning, thestoryline became bogged down with too many subplots . . . therewere also numerous uninteresting characters that had no appealto me . . . by the end, I didn't really care what happened."
2,Uses Lord's name in vain,I was enjoying this book right up until the point where the GD word was inserted. I threw the book away. I won't buy any more from this author.
4,Good light action,Entertaining with well developed characters and an interesting plot. A fun read. Medical fiction at its best. A page turner.
3,Good read but predictable,"This was an interesting read and a good mystery in the style of Palmer. But, after the first half of the book my suspicions were aroused that not everything in the characters was as it seemed to be. But this is typical of many mystery novels and after you have read so many of them you can start to predict patterns in different authors.The only really disappointing thing about the book was there were a lot of loose ends left at the end that I would have liked to have wrapped up.Overall a good book by a good author."
2,A great disappointment,"This wonderful voice is best with an orchestral back-up, not with the solo piano here--good as the piano is. Also, the choice and mixture of songs is rather strange--many unmelodious and tedious. Finally, I must say regrettably that he looks about at his worst here--from the lighting or whatever--and adding to that, not informally but sloppily dressed, which is bad for his figure. I made a mistake by buying this disc."
3,Michael Live at the Donmar.,"I'm a fan of Michael Ball however, this DVD concert is much different than his previous concerts. Not one of my favorites. I would not recommend this product."
1,An Embarrasment,"Awful, simply awful. I am surprised a superstar like Michael Ball would allow something like this to be released. The only pleasure I got out of this DVD was dropping it in the trash."
5,"If you wonder about miami's South beach, listen to this!!!","Latin Guitar at its best. I heard this guy playing live in South Beach, in a sidewalk cafe, and this CD takes you there. How many Latin artists play ""Stairway To Heaven?"" This guy does, and as good as I have ever heard it. An exuberent and great listening collection of Latin numbers."
2,Worked great until it died,"Used it for about 8 months until the 1, 5, and 9 buttons stopped working. It's great that I only paid ... for it, so I don't feel so bad throwing it away."
4,Strongest Silver Mt. Zion Release to Date,"While on previous efforts Efrim's vocals weren't very dependable, this EP marks the first time where he really succeeds without sounding like nails on a blackboard. Also, the music is drastically more cohesive than before, and we get actual rocking out on the first track. Short, but very sweet."
3,"""Microphones in the trees""","That's one of the repeated word-pictures sung here (other good ones are on the previous release). It's effective and, I suppose, true, somewhere. The first track is a call for action, the last a lamentation -- Efrim & co. are tired of the struggle. The music: after three listens I'm glad they separated this stuff from the much better ""THIS IS OUR PUNK-ROCK,""..."
4,Tragedy brought to light.,"If you've read Ambrose's D-Day then the battle descriptions here don't present anything new or groundbreaking. The true value of Mr. Kershaw's work is the glimpse of what the people at home went through. The agonizing wait and worry of those left behind to man the homefront are really conveyed extremely well. Finally, the shock and sorrow of the soldiers' wives, girlfriends, mothers, fathers, and siblings are brought to the forefront. The scenes of a town bound together by tragedy are as emotional as they are fascinating to uncover. This is the purpose and point of Kershaw's book and he delivers."
4,"its about the boys , not DDAY!","not well written but the images it evokes of the boys in Bedford were good.who else covers individuals?do not expect a book about D-day , the army, etcbut Eisenhower caused deaths of many by his incompetence"
3,Decent,"The Bedford boysThe Book the Bedford boys was an ok book. It was really boring until the D-day scene. And after it was really boring also. The Author Alex Kershaw interviewed all of the people and just sort of jumbled the interviews together. He would also repeat a lot of sentences that he already used in the book for another section. But the D-day scene was very interesting, but it was also hard to follow because of the amount that the author jumped from person to person. The book shows the price of war in great detail. If you don't like history and aren't interested in war don't read this book."
5,Hard to Put Down,"This book is amazing, I had trouble putting it down even though I only did so two or three times. The descriptive characterization, wonderful attention to detail and first-hand accounts really give this book life and a deeper insight into the cost of war. Following the Bedford Boys from Virginia to England, and finally the beaches of Normandy, makes it all the harder to lose them after becoming so acquainted with each individual.The inclusion of the events back in Bedford also add merit and emotion to the book; learning about the home front provides a better look at what it took for the United States to win while also explaining the true losses that were experienced after D-Day.Overall this book is wonderful, a great source of knowledge about World War Two as well as a powerful reminder of the costs of war, for soldiers and their families."
1,"Questionable concept, no good song","If the fellows from CaliGari where trying to create the most banal-pop drivel possible, they very nearly succeeded. Each of the four cds here is something like a solo project for each member: Shuuji's is the most CaliGari-sounding, but at the same time, is boring; Kenjii reveals how, after CaliGari he could join such a lackluster band as Sex Machineguns; Ao, I suppose in order to out-treacle the rest of the fellows, is unspeakably insipid. Only Makoto's project, which has an electro-pop feel, is even listenable.Not worth the payola unless you have a transcendent, morbid fascination when it comes to horrible music - not CaliGari quality by any means."
1,Please read this review before proceeding,"This is nothing more than one of the worst facsimilie editions I've ever seen in my life - this one of the 1925 original edition. It appears this edition was simply photo copied from an original copy - and badly. My particular copy looks like the toner cartridge needed replacing. Floor plans are completely illegible. All this for the magnificent price! The cover, as shown here, is the only aspect of this production even approaching quality."
2,cheap looking,this is really not a sorting hat....it's just a black felt hat...and is very cheap. Don't buy!
5,I LOVE THIS COOKER!,"I GREW UP ON PRESSURE COOKERS. MY 20 YEAR OLD PRESTO WAS STILL FINE ON MY OLD WEDGEWOOD, BUT WE MOVED TO A GLASS TOP THAT REQUIRED SOMETHING WITH AN ACTUAL FLAT BOTTOM. THE KUHN IS AWESOME -- PLENTY OF ROOM FOR MORE THAN 4 ARTICHOKES, LARGE ENOUGH TO SAFELY COOK BEANS IN, ETC. VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE. I USE IT ALMOST DAILY."
3,The lack of silence leaves me wanting.,"Functionally speaking, it does reach pressure like it's supposed to, and it is constructed of a decent gauge steel. The tri-metal base construction allows it to be used on any heat source as well, and seems to distribute the heat decently evenly.However, it is not silent. When cooking anything beyond the first red line (almost every recipe says use the second...) my lid emits a slight hiss and releases a small amount of steam. Not as loud as turning the valve for a quick release, but not what I expect from something so expensive compared to it's competition. And in spite of what the myriad of reviews say about a lack of hissing/noise I am told this is normal.I've tried it on 3 different types of cook-tops: gas, glass-top electric, and induction. I get the same results on all 3 regardless of power/heat settings."
5,I love this cooker,"But I wonder if anyone has successfully canned foods with it,Experts say you can't use anything smaller than a 10 qt. pot to can.Kuhn Rikon says you can can in their pressure cookers.???"
2,"Top Model, Top Headache","The spring loaded release valve became stuck before I got to use the cooker for a first time. The manual gives instructions on how to remove, dismantle for cleaning, and return the spring and valve stem. But, the screw would not budge, even with using a pair of vice grips. The handle didn't look very sturdy, either. I was disappointed with how a ""top of the line"" pressure cooker is built. I might have given this item a higher rating based on how a ""top of the line"" pressure cooker performs but I never got to use it. For my money, I want something built better or I will be happy spending less on another product near equally built."
5,Our Favorite Cookware,"We have three Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers that we use almost every time we cook - this is the main cookware we use. It's fast, easy, and it saves energy becaues it takes less time to cook. And the food's great - I like eating at home better than any restaurant."
4,very easy but check the screw,This pressure cooker is a big improvement over my old cooker (with the weight on top). The lid seals quickly and there is no steam leakage while cooking. Depressurizing and opening and then repressurizing is quickly and easily done. The unit came with the pressure control screw loose so it did not preesurize when first used. The instruction manual describes how to fix but was an initial concern.
1,Do not buy,"Kuhn Rikon Duromatic pressure cooker is top of the line and quite expensive. One would therefore expect top quality. It's not the case. 3 months after I bought mine, the flimsy plastic pieces that held the ""valve housing"" broke. It was very irritating but I continued using the pressure cooker... Until one day I realized the ""indicator stem"" had fallen into the boiling food I was cooking along with the ""spring"".I grew up with pressure cookers. My mother and aunts bought theirs in the sixties, my sisters and friends later and they are still using them. They cook good food and fast and save energy.I am absolutely appalled about the poor quality of this product and I have one recommendation for consumers: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a waste of money."
5,These pads are great,"They cost a little more,but well worth the price; quiet and smooth I would recommend these to anyone . Well worth the money"
1,UNBELIEVABLY NOISY!,"This cot is unbelievably noisy! The fabric makes a horrendous rubbing sound on the aluminum tubes whenever you make the slightest movement. I brought 4 of these cots on a 2 week camping trip without trying them out at home first. I can't believe they actually sell these. I couldn't find any other cots to buy while on my trip, so I had to drill out the rivets holding the cot together, wrap the aluminum tubes with duct tape, roughen the tape with sandpaper, cover the fabric and frame with liquid laundry soap, then screw them back together with expensive binding post screws. I wasted at least 1-1/2 days of my vacation on fixing these cots. Coleman says they have not heard any ""feedback"" about the noise."
2,Nothing new here.,"If you are a novice, or somewhat inhibited sexually, this book might be helpful to you. If you already enjoy oral sex, understand the value of communication, know how to convey desire, and are open-minded, this book doesn't have much to offer. Why do so many sex guides assume women are squeamish?"
1,This Book Deserves No Stars!,This book was crude. The author wrote about an incestous relationship.I'll never buy anything by this author again.
1,Crude and Distasteful,"I found this book to be crude and distasteful. Mr. Masterton uses many street/slang terms for body parts and sexual acts. I found the use of such trash language to be demeaning and disgusting. This book may have some good information, but how can you find it through all the trash. I sent the book back without finishing it, because I found it read more like a trash novel then a self-help book."
3,X-rated but Interesting,"No doubt about it, Graham Masterton's sex books are not comparable to Dr. Ruth's in the aspect that her books tend to be general, technical and medical sounding, where as Masterton holds nothing back, just like he proposes for a healthy and exciting sex life should be unrestrained! The author quotes bed-room revelations from many men and women, and language runs the gammut. As for me, I've read several books by this author, and due to the pornographic nature of his sex instructionals I have had to reconsider my earlier reviews which I now feel weren't fully responsible since, as a Christain, pornography is certainly not something I should be promoting. In short, page through a book and decide for yourself."
4,Works Good!,"We had it on my husbands dirt bike a little over a day, when he somehow bumped it with his leg and it cracked in half. (I seem to recall something about ""I was falling and I went to save myself .... LOL) I've got it on my quad and it's great!!!! Holds tight and I've not had any problems. I just ordered another one for his bike ... I have faith it was just a fluke (Of course ... since he never rides extreem rides and he never falls LOL) and hope his next one holds up better (thinking I should have ordered a case?!?!?) :)"
4,I use this on my ATV,"I have been using this mount on my ATV for 3 years. My friends also uses one, although he's broken 2 and almost lost his GPS once. This is because it really needs a safety strap put on it. It breaks if you hit something like a branch, (which is normal), but if you value your GPS, put some kind of strap on it so you don't lose it.That being said, I've never had mine come off accidentaly from jumping or vibration, and I ride pretty hard."
3,It works,This product is a bit flimsy but does work well. You just have to be careful that it doesnt get struck by sticks or the like.
3,Didn't Fit ATV Handlebar,"Ordered the Garmin Handlebar Mount for my older Polaris ATV, but there isn't enough room on the handlebars to affix the mount. My bad, should've checked that first. Other than that, the mount fits my Garmin Rhino GPS. Once I modify my ATV to accept the mount I'll find out if it'll hold my GPS over rough terrain, but I have my doubts."
3,Mount,This product worked great. However once the temperature dropped below 40 degress the plastic become brittle and it ended up breaking.
5,Garmin Bike Mount,Holds GPS tightly. does not rotate drift or chatter like other products. highly recomend this
1,Not secure,Item was hard to fit to product that it was intended for and I finaly found a better salution.
4,A Leftist's Defense of the Bush/Blair War,"William Shawcross is a man of the left who made his reputation with the book Sideshow, which was about Kissinger, Nixon and their campaign in Cambodia. Unlike many on the left, in this slim, provocative volume he supports the Anglo-american alliance in Iraq and the Bush-Blair campaign to oust Saddam Hussein and attempt build a more liberal Arab society in Iraq. Shawcross was appalled by the death of his friend Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN diplomat who was killed by the truck bombing of the UN compound in Iraq. He sees Islamic terrorists as the forces of darkness who are opposed to the civil society and feels that leftists who express sympathy with them are terribly misguided. Shawcross is very critical of French policy, which he feels has not been driven by idealism but by cynicsm, craven self-interest and myopic anti-Americanism."
1,"Ms.Eisenberg is not accurate, and I have no relationship to her","Listen, Ms. Eisenberg, let's get the facts. There was no bullying, and it was not America that divided Germany. It was one man, and only one man, that allowed Russia to go into Berlin and divide the city even though our military should have been the military to go in. That man, a demented Roosevelt that should never have been allowed in office for four terms, acted contrary to every sensible leader's position in the U.S. To even remotely claim that America made this decision is not only not acceptable, it is untenable, and should be deeply repented of. It is my opinion that you have made this position to sell a book, and to earn dollars doing it."
2,Does not play nice with other analog phones,"The AT&T 955 is a pack animal - they work best with their own kind or their cousin, the 964 (wth answerer). We have a mix of AT&T, Uniden and V-Tech multi-line analog phones at our small office, and found the following problems:1) Calls placed on hold at the 955 and picked up at another extension do not clear the on-hold indicator and the phone bleeps on-hold warnings even though another extension has already taken the call. Further, once the call is terminated, the 955 does not register the fact, and holds the line open, forcing you to return to the 955 and physically hang up.2) The 955 would tie the lines together unexpectedly. Pick up Line 1, and Lines 3 and 4 would light (and yes, we triple-checked our premise and LEC wiring for problems!).In conclusion - In for a penny, in for a pound. Buying an AT&T 955 or 964 means going exclusively with that product for your office. That's just not flexible enough for us."
1,Flat out....these phones suck!!!!,"We purchased 3 of the AT&T; 955 phones for a small business. After about a week, they all have had their quircky problems.1. One of the handsets broke, luckily they actually sent me a new one.2. Occassionally when you pick up line 1 line 3 lights up (seems to be a common problem).3. The lines ""hum"" periodically. After contacting the trouble shooting desk, they recommend I get the jack replaced,well, it still does it.4. They do not work well with cordless phones, the lines do not release, unless you do it manually.I am in the process of returning these and getting something else, they ARE NOT DEPENDABLE."
5,Such a joy!,"What a pleasure to read the entire story of Josefina in one hardcover book. ABSOLUTELY worth the money! You should know, however, that the historal sections at the end of each of the original six books are NOT included. There is one large section on the history, but by no means as comprehensive as the six sections found in the entire series. Still worth buying...Now I have all of these new HC books AND the six book series! :-)"
2,it's probley good during class review....,"It's too much information,NCLEX exams is nothing like what's in this book.NCLEX questions are simple and direct. the best REVIEW is read your school textbook and nothing else.then you'll pass..as simple that..Get rid of this book fast, it's useless..."
5,very good review for taking NCLEX-PN,"I find this book very easy to use. The material which is covered in the book is that of latest NCLEX PN exam. The CD-ROM that comes with it, is excellent practice for the actual exam itself which is computerized, and this is an excellent simulation. It was also reasonably priced compared to other review books out there."
4,LPN review,I found the review items in this text very helpful as a PN student studying the different body systems
4,2 many pencil markings,"The book was farely new and in great shape the disk had not been opened but it had a little 2 much marking in it, thank God it was pencil and not pen though."
5,Awesome,I am so excited about receiving this item. I am a Nursing Student and this has benefited me in my current studies tremendously..this is one of the best NCLEX Review guides I have used!!
5,lippincott,This is a very good book nd easy to understand. A lot if people use it in my school and recommend it to everyone.
4,"helped during school , but sanders is better for actual nclex",seemed to match the rationale of questions on nursing school exams; however Saunders proved to be the very best for Nclex review. The green nclex saunders is just as good as the red one.
1,"Poor quality, broke after three weeks",Have owned this phone for three weeks and already has problem with going dead while you are in the middle of talking with someone. Appears the battery or wiring is defective. Bottom line recommendation-stay away from this phone!
5,Amazing series,"This series is full of all kinds of really cool stuff. Some might say it's useless but...so is ""lil wayne."" And if I have to fill my time with useless things, this is definietly my prefered way of going about it. Great graphics, very in depth and thought provoking. Love it. In fact I think I'm going to watch now. Watched several times and never get tired of it. It's been said that Stephen hawking isn't one of the top rated physicist amongst his colleagues. But given his way of describing things and his disabilities that do not seem to hold him back much, I'd say he's very important in his field. He brings theoretical astrophysics into a manner in which anyone can understand (even if it's difficult to comprehend sometimes). But it's like Einstein said, if you can't explain a theory to a child, the theory is probably useless."
4,For Us Simple Folk,"I can't speak on the validity of theories presented in this film. Heck - I've never even watched Star Wars. Regardless, I enjoyed watching and listening to this. If nothing else, it puts one's life in perspective for a few hours. And that made it worth viewing."
3,"Great CGI, very little information.","I'm sure Stephen Hawking could bury anyone with his cosmological knowledge. He wouldn't bury a third grader with this DVD. It is full of gee-whiz ideas and Mr. Hawking's guesses at what possible form that life elsewhere in the universe could take. But he didn't go very deep at all.The Computer Generated Imagery was fantastic, though. On the other hand, there very little knowledge or information contained there.If you are looking for something more substantial, check out the ""Through the Wormhole"" series."
5,"well made, geared toward mass market","I've watched this series twice since buying the DVD and I enjoy it. Hawkings has a history of writing and appealing to the mass market, he does not write text books for graduate school students. The review that slammed this program makes no sense, written someone who thinks he knows more than Hawkings.This program is about 90% computer graphics and animation which makes it visually appealing with a 'science fiction' look to it. Very entertaining, educational and thought provoking."
5,Great deal!,Great dvd for the buck. Great show shown on tv. Morgan Freeman makes physics seem sooo interesting! He is an outstanding narrator. The series covers several topics related to physics and astronomy.
3,Ok but strange,"I bought this and sat down to watch it. I was simply amazed at some of the things Stephen Hawking was on about. I thought he had gone insane. This did not live up to my expectations and felt I had wasted my time. I am glad that it was on TV! It is worth watching as there are some good things in it, but it isn't some of his best work."
2,It's speculation I know,This is a one disk quickie that looks like it was pumped out for the Discovery channel. We all know how popular Stephen Hawking is so when he has speculative thoughts on aliens and wormholes it makes for colorful programming. Most of this presentation is speculative and Stephen says so in the DVD extras.Go ahead and watch this 135 minutes quickie as it is new and popular but do not expect any more than fluff-n-stuff.
2,Puff,"I just bought this Sanyo to replace my Sunbeam food steamer. (I stripped the timer by turning it backward. A No-No on these cheap appliances.) I much prefer the rice from the Sunbeam. The fuzzy logic rice comes out too light, i.e. there's no density, weight or toothsomeness to the cooked rice. I'm not a rice expert but I know that according to my preference the Sanyo overcooks the rice.Also, the Sanyo has no alarm to inform you when the cooking ends and warming begins. You have to use your separate kitchen timer if you need a reminder. There is however a thirteen (13) minute digital display countdown to finish.I suspect I'm going to replace my Sunbeam food steamer and, to save valuable apartment space, give away the Sanyo fuzzy logic rice steamer which I bought in part to save space. Sorry, but for me the Sanyo fuzzy logic rice steamer has turned out to be a disappointing waist of money."
5,I love these dang things.,"You can never have enough scissors! I had an older pair of these for years and years but lost them / had them stolen. I just bought them again because I love these things! I keep this in my toolbox and I use them to cut through everything! You know those packages you get with the plastic that is impossible to open? That's my favorite thing to use these on. It just doesn't take any crap from any type of packaging! I've cut rugs, cardboard, wire, etc. Anything. I use these for everything. AND the bottle opener / screwdriver thing is a nice touch too! But seriously - these are indespensible. If you have a toolbox or are putting one together for someone - you just gotta have these things."
3,"Nice music, but not what is advertised","Erotic Lounge: They're half right. It's lounge music, but I wouldn't describe it as erotic. This is a nice collection of mostly instrumental, jazzy lounge music. The only problem is that they've packaged it is as being sensual and erotic. One disc is called Quick and Dirty, while the other is Slow and Lazy. Combine this with the softcore pic on the cover of a lady's legs, high heels and undies coming off, and the message is clear. But when I put the CDs in, it just seemed like your average lounge music with lots of drum machine and synthesizer tracks. And the Quick and Dirty disc is neither quick or dirty. I wouldn't call it sexually charged at all.It's a nice collection of mostly instrumental music, but was packaged and marketed incorrectly in my opinion."
1,WRONG TRACKLISTING LISTED ON AMAZON-BEWARE!,"There are two versions of this cd-the original Erotic Lounge Vol1 UPC 509975109002 which includes Thievery Corporation-Until The Morning and the later version just Erotic Lounge (same cover but vastly different tracklisting-no Until The Morning) UPC 5099751090021.I've contacted Amazon on this but the tracklisting listed here on the site hasn't been corrected and I've contacted Amazon retailers before purchasing to make sure I'm getting the original tracklisting to no avail, most need to (but won't check what cd version it is before they send it to you)"
3,Thought it was better,"Nothing erotic, so don't try to get into mood with it.Just lounge music, relaxing sounds, soft voices."
2,Number 5 is much better,The problem with the Erotic Lounge series is that these CDs are expensive. I have number 5 and I like it. But this one does not hold my attention. I find most of the tracks to be flat and boring.
4,Great CD for the best thing in life,This CD is a burner. Smooth and soft Tracks on the first CD with nice background sounds to stimulate and CD2 gets you to the peak of the Night :)A must have for a perfect night with a beautiful girl.
2,The idea was much better than the product,The product is very cheaply made and does not really keep the knees far enough apart. I use a molded memory foam pillow now and it performs much better.This was a good idea but not very well executed.
3,Leg Spacer,"I have purchase better than is particular one. However, it is addiquite for the price I paid, it help me not to knock my knees together when I sleep."
1,Mouse Mover is a COMPLETE RIP-OFF,"I have a periodic problem with mice in my kitchen drawers. I was thrilled to learn about the Mouse Mover in hopes of ending this problem. What a joke. First, I kept it on the counter, thinking the noise it made would be enough to scare away the mouse directly below. I tried all sorts of different settings with the same result: mouse poop in the drawer every morning. Okay, I thought, maybe the drawers were too well insulated. So I literally plugged the thing in and placed the Mouse Mover in the drawer itself. Well, the mouse seems to enjoy the sound, because I keep finding poop all around it. Don't waste your money. If I could figure out how to get mine back, I would do it immediately."
1,IT DOES NOT WORK,"I was so shocked with this item. I have a terrible fear of rodents, not fear as much as being simply disgusted by them. My father-in-law was recently diagnosed with cancer in India, so my wife and I took an emergency trip to India. Emergency or not, I purchased this item to take to India. I take this so that I can live in peace in India for the few weeks that I am there. There was not a mouse but a RAT walking around this thing while it just buzzed away. I was there for a total of 22 days and this thing did not work at all. Save your money and get a sharper image by buying another item."
1,I think mice are attracted to it -Not even worth 1 star,This is the worst product I have ever bought. Will never by any other sharper image product again. I know my neighbors were having mice issues so I thought it would be a good idea to buy this device. Prior to purchasing the device I had never seen a mouse in our house. During the first month we used the device we were also used the sticky paper at the same time (the paper was also there when we didnt have the device). So within the month of using the device I found 3 mice stuck to the paper. Its a joke dont buy it. Amazon should remove the product from the site since its false advertising to say it scares off mice
5,It worked for me,"I purchased this item a couple years ago and it has been working so far. We use to have allot of mice running around, but not now.I saw it work one day just outside our house, when a field mouse came around, and the electronic signal messed with the mice. It couldn't motivate and was like it was drunk, it finally moved further away from the house and then ran off into the woods."
1,Does not work.............,"I bought three of these things because I have an extreme fear of rodents, and I would say that I thought that this was working, until I went into my kitchen and saw a mouse running around. Save your money because this does not work......."
5,"Great Learning, Easy Read, Easy to Follow","After meeting Lou during a past life regression, certain things came through that she would have no idea about, and after that I decided to read her book. It was a book that I had a hard time putting down. Not only was it very easy to read, it was easy to learn from. This book helped open up the other gifts that I have been given in the right way. The stories are wonderful, and they are real people, with different names. A great author, who knows how to write so that you can read without wondering what that word is. When others need to understand their angels or past lives, this is the first book that I suggest to them, in fact I have leant it out and others weren't able to put it down, it is a have to read for all."
3,Was OK for about 9mths,"This phone HAD good sound quality even with my DSL(yes filters were on)...Just a barely audible little hiss on the line unless you turn up (well ""slide up"")the phone's volume too high). There is a thingie you slide to control the volume...no button. I guess for the price I should not expect anything GREAT. Well after around 9mths or so I am getting such a BAD crackling noise on the line (even when my I'm not using my PC and the DSL is not on)that I can no longer use this phone. What is sad I paid almost $15 for it @an office supplies store yet I am seeing it on various sites including this one for between $5-10 now. Oh well... LOL."
2,"Weird Handset, too light.","The handset on this phone is way too weird to use comfortably and the phone is so light that the base gets dragged around by the handset when you are using it. I like the AT&T 210 Trimline phones (which are supposedly discontinued, but easy to find on Amazon.com) much better."
4,A good lightweight phone for the price,"I bought the phone for my mom, who has trouble gripping things. She had a phone with the buttons on the handset, and would inadvertently press some of the buttons while holding the handset. This phone's handset is very lightweight, and has no buttons that could interrupt the call. The sound quality seems to be good as well."
4,Top Notch Classic Bluegrass,Most folks don't realize that Bluegrass really din't exist until around the mid 1900's. These guys might not have been as influential as Bill Monroe or Earl Skruggs but they are right up there with them. They have great voices for Bluegrass...btw.
2,A Good Effort,"PuraFe has one of the most soulful voices I've ever heard and I loved her work with Ulali. However, in this CD, her material is weak and monotonous and the effect of her amazing voice starts to fade by the 2nd cut. Overall, this was a disappointment given what a great singer she is."
1,Don't Bother,"Black Lace books are supposed to have interesting plots and exciting sex scenes. This book has neither. Oh sure, the heroine, who isn't really all that likeable, has lots of sex. She'll sleep with almost anybody at the drop of a hat. However, there's not a lot of detail in the sex scenes and who cares anyway since Maddie and the reader never get to know anything about any of her partners. There is no buildup, no getting to know any of the men and hoping she will get together with them soon.I read all the Black Lace books, so obviously, I'm not a prude, but I couldn't like Maddie because she was such a slutty woman. I guess the reader is meant to find her near public sex acts daring and titillating. I just found her unsympathetic and got bored by the lack of detail and character development."
2,Ho-Hum,"After reading the previous reviews, I decided to order this book, but was very disappointed. The story primarily consists of a not-particularly likeable heroine having sex with just about every man she meets. Very little time is spent on characterization, and there is almost no buildup of sexual tension. The sex itself is light on details and relatively unimaginative. If you like your stories with a lame plot, shallow characters, and lots of white-bread sex, this book is for you! (But not for me.)"
2,Woodstock 24-pc brush set,"I thought all foam brushes were the same. Not so with this product; the foam is not as dense and is very porous; therefore giving out in no time. I used it to apply oil stains on wood so after destroying the first 2, I had to lighten my strokes dramatically( the plastic frame is so close to the foam at the tip, you don't have much choice anyway). I would'nt recommend applying thicker matter like paint, nor applying it on rough surfaces. Thought I made a good purchase, but I'll be visually inspecting those at the home center first. The only positive aspect is with so many brushes on hand, you should have enough to complete a small to mid size project, but with a lot going to waste."
2,Smooth finish but wear out very fast,I was urethaning a rocking chair I made and before I was half finished the form wore down to the plastic base that holds the foam. Foam is too soft and porous. Will not buy again. Would not recommend.
5,great price,Quality product. Great price. Will order again. I use these sponges to apply stain to my projects. can't beat the price
2,"Best Annual so far, but to cheesy!","This is by far the best album that ministry have created, a lot of bass in this one! But still full of the cheesy pop tunes that all the 12 year olds like (so if your 12 you'll like this one!) if you after something not so cheesy go for gatecrasher experience or slinky Tokyo"
2,too much cheese,"Actually make it 2 1/2 stars, halfway seems pretty fair.this years is ok, better than last years but still not a classic.So many cheesy tracks(lollipop, be cool, unbreak my heart), about 10 or more songs that are remakesjust kinda turned me off.My favourite tracks were: beatbox 130, did i dream (song to the siren), out of the city and emerge, about half of the rest were pretty good but no tracks that i really loved. I don't know if it's just me but this one seemed more cheesy than ever before, it even has the ketchup song! bah buuut it's ok really."
4,"Saruman, Come Forth!","Summoning's seventh release, ""Lost Tales"", is not as bad as other reviewers had said. While there are only two keyboard tracks, both are very impressive. ""Arcenstone"" was supposed to be on Silenius' never-to-be-released project, Mirkwood. It is very relaxing and reminds me far away lands covered in tree and stone. ""Saruman"" was an unreleased track from the ""Dol Guldor"" recordings. Both tracks have no guitars or vocals, which I think is perfect for these two particular songs. There are vocal samples from Tolkien brocasts, which are placed perfectly in the songs. A good cd single, it gets 4 stars only because there are two songs. Protector and Silenius, keep up the good atmospheric work!"
3,vintage sound,"I have always loved the Franco Zeffirelli 1973 movie Brother Sun Sister Moon and decided to search for the soundtrack. Whilst a soundtrack does not exist this is a welcome alterative choice.Although only 4 of the tracks are from the film, Buddy Comfort sings with pleasant conviction.This album would be appropriate for reflective, meditative moments.Let's hope one day we will be able to purchase a full soundtrack."
3,"Fun for kids, not for parents!","I bought these feet for my 5 year old son, after he saw the movie and loved it and was tap dancing around the house pretending to be Mumble. Needless to say, he loves them. Then, I had to go back to get another pair for my 2 year old son, who copies his brother. So, now picture it, 2 kids, tap dancing away, with music, get it? Very annoying after about 15 minutes. Plus, the velcro on the bottom sticks to the carpets, and also the feet themselves the wrong way. The instructions do say not to use the feet on carpet, but try telling that to 2 dancing kids."
1,Broke 2nd time I used it,Very poorly constructed. While the vehicle was parked it came off the window and bounced to the floor. Two parts of the plastic broke rendering it completely useless.
2,Weak design,"Had mine for about six weeks. I found it broken on the floor of my car one morning. When securing the unit , a significant amount of force is needed to turn the lever to adhere the suction cup to the glass. This amount of force is apparently to much for the main frame and over time.... device failure. The gps unit was not mounted at the time so no additional weight contributed to the mounting bracket failing. Seems like a weak design... until some manufacturing changes are made to make it stronger I can't say I would recommend this product."
2,Disappointing,"This seemed like a solid three-star book up until the end, which was abrupt and frustrating and left me wondering why I'd just wasted the last few hours on this book. The premise was interesting: an insider's look at being a personal assistant to a mega pop-star, with some family drama thrown on top because in this case the pop star and the assistant were cousins who grew up together in Oklahoma. Of course the Assistant Cousin gets sucked into the screwed up family drama of Pop Star Cousin, who has been a star since her pre-teen years and whose parents are her over-controlling managers. The Pop Star's life becomes a total train wreck and I kept waiting for the Assistant Cousin to be the voice of reason to help stop the train, but she got drawn into all the mess, too. It was sad and chaotic and I guess supposed to be like what Britney Spears went through... but I mostly just wish I could get back the time I spent on this book because the ending was so lame."
4,Fun and different take on family relationships,"Hard to put down. Not as well written as a classic like Atlas Shrugged, but a fun beach or vacation read. Not all ponies and rainbows, though....some distressing and sad revealations."
3,Between You and Me,"Nothing special about this book. I would not purchase it again, and I do not think I will buy another book by the authors."
3,"Intriguing topic, a bit slow","I got the Kindle edition because it wasn't pricey and read about it somewhere as a ""great summer read.""The premise is intriguing -- a cousin becomes the personal assistant of her superstar famous cousin. The promise is to see what the life is like as the one who ""sees everything.""The reality is less intriguing as it probably is in real life. Yes, there are escapades and secrets. It's not very juicy, however. The sex scenes fade to black before they get anywhere. It felt like a watered down imagining of Britney Spears's or Lindsay Lohan's life. The characters are hard to care about. The family secrets aren't very juicy either.It wasn't a great read. It was okay. I was hoping for more fantasy, I guess."
2,Kritters Ramblings,"Check out the full review on Kritters RamblingsAn interesting take on the behind the scenes of a singer who is becoming quite famous and how her world completely unravels. I would say it is almost a semi biography of the Britney Spears crazy years. But just like the main character who goes a little nutso, this book was a little nutso."
4,Lacks detail in key areas,"Overall, this is an outstanding text for learning CSS and how to appropriately use it with HTML and XHTML. It is perfect for someone who is already comfortable with basic HTML markup and would like to leverage the various advantages of CSS. The book's only weak point is its coverage of the CSS box model. Arguably one of the more difficult parts of learning CSS, the chapter on the box model makes only passing reference to the float property, which is used very frequently in CSS layouts. Other examples in the box chapter were overly simplified and did not give much more info than I've found online.The chapters on the basic syntax of CSS are very good and the typography coverage is outstanding."
3,"Disappointing: useful but not enough, and often confusing","This book's first chapter is about the only one that is clear. The rest of the chapters are unfortunately not well presented and structured. The examples and the CSS examples are laid out in very confusing ways. It is very often difficult to tell which snippet of code matches which screenshot. In that respect, chapter 7 is a nightmare.Also cruelly missing from the book are a list of all possibly attributes for each property.You will not be able to learn CSS entirely from this book. You will have to either buy another more comprehensive book, or to use Web tutorials."
3,Awsome Airplanes,"Awsome Airplanes is one in a series of children's videos narrated by ""Howard"" (Vin Parker - also the producer/director), and is a pretty good overview of the history and types of airplanes. The video also includes a behind the scenes look at an airport."
2,Joy of Cooking Keepsake (Miniature Edition) by Irma S. Romba,"Itis the first ""Joy of Cooking"" to disappoint me. It is cute, but with none of the substance I have come to expect from the Rombauer crowd. If you love the original or any of the new versions as I do, You may be disappointed in this one. I guess I just hoped for that same ""Packed with information"" quality and didn't get it."
5,excellent little rice cooker,"I have this rice cooker for several years now. I works perfectly every time. The timer is excellent and you can set when you want the rice to be cooked. I have to use the time all the times since I need it to be ready in the early morning sometimes. The only complaint that I might have is the long time that it takes to cook the rice. I assume that's because of the extra thick pot or the special design for it to cook the perfect rice. I would like to find out how and where I can get a replacement pot. Like most non-stick pots or pans, they wear out after a while. Though I can still use it, I would like a new one if I could. If anyone out there know where to get one, please post it here. Thanks."
1,Mysteriously fails to cook...,"This rice cooker has been our biggest disappointment of any appliance we own. About 75% of the time pushing the 'Cook' button results in the light being on but nothing happening for an hour or two. Then at some point it figures things out and starts actually warming up the water, etc. Truly frustrating.When it works, it is fine. But without being able to count on it, it is worthless."
4,Answers for Grosse Pointe,"Glutinous rice is also commonly called sweet rice.Brown rice, even American, takes much longer to cook than white rice.Japanese rice has been sold with some kind of flour on it that has to be rinsed off first. Within the past year we have been able to buy ""rinse-free"" rice.Porridge in this context is probably Okayu (Japanese) or Congee (Chinese). This is a gruel made of a little rice & a lot of water. We used to flavor ours with ginger & crab. Usually served to babies or convalescents.Appliances made for the Japanese & American markets will work in both. The difference in voltage is only the difference between 110-120. So the amount of voltage will affect the rice. Also, the rice will need more water if it is older, rather than this year's ""new crop."""
2,Scorched rice.,"I am glad that Amazon stopped selling this rice cooker. And I wish they had done so before I purchaed this rice cooker.This rice cooker will give you scorched rice (What we call ""okoge"" in Japanese) at the bottom everytime I cook rice with it.I e-mailed Sanyo about this and received no reply.I will buy Zojirushi next time."
2,Good except for annoying echo,This phone has a fatal flaw. When you talk even a bit loudly you hear a distorted echo of your own voice. This is so annoying that I had to return this phone. Another negative is that none of three headsets that I tried worked well with this phone. These problems are unfortunate since most other aspects of this product were quite good.
3,"Good phone, won't last long","I have this model phone. It's easy to use and configure, sound quality is good and it is pretty flexible. I've had mine about three years, and it was fine for the first two. I'm looking to replace it because the speakerphone cuts out after a few seconds and I no longer hear the other end of the call. The main reason for individuals (not companies) to get speakerphones is to not need to hold a handset while waiting or typing, and if this doesn't work then that's the end of the phone's usefulness. Buh-bye, AT&T 972."
4,"Finally, a navigation book that challenges you","While probably not the best first navigation text, for the semi experienced boater, Learn to Navigate gets down to the nitty-gritty of the subject. The numerous examples and practice problems at the beginning and end of each chapter challenge the student and reinforces learning."
3,shootfighter tekken,"I really liked this anime it had a good story and some really cool grappling action. Its the story of a father who is passing his deadly family martial art to his son. I think the season should have been stretched out a little more, more episodes, more conflict building, more charater development. good anime not great but definitly worth the price i would like to see a season two but i know this will never happen. its not as good as baki but it could have been if it was just stretched out a lil more."
1,Pretty but Simple,"This knob feels great, looks great functions great as a volumne knob. I really needed it for video editing as a shuttle knob and it did not work well. Software support was limited for Adobe Premier Elements 8 and even thogh I could program it for the editor it still had limited finess in the control. Turning the knob would move forward & back but not faster the farther I turned it. If you need a flashy pretty looking volumne knob it is swell, and now they support more then one on a system, Works with Windows 7 fine. Pretty blue light with variable intensity. But nix for videos editing. I returned it after an hour of testing.Also as it was 3rd party and not direct through Amazon the return process has been very slow. 3 weeks and still waiting for refund."
1,Pretty close to completely useless,"I think the other reviews have it nailed (search on the silver-colored version to see a complete list of reviews) - on the Mac it is of minimal usefulness - even as a volume control for iTunes, it ONLY works if you have iTunes in the foreground - which is an unlikely situation - usually you'd want to adjust volume or mute iTunes playback (i.e. for a phone call) when you were working in another application. If you have to click on iTunes to bring it to the foreground, why not just click on the control to mute.On XP, as other reviewers have noted, the driver is buggy and hasn't been updated since 2004. If you are lucky the PowerMate will work for a few minutes - usually it does nothing at all in any application (oh - except glowing and pulsing!). Completely useless.The Keyspan digital media and iTunes remote controls ARE able to control iTunes in the background - on both Mac OS X and XP - and they are what I use now in place of the useless PowerMate."
4,"Good Traditional Ska, but not as good as Washaway & others","I recently bought this CD and was a little disappointed. I enjoy listening to it, but after listening non-stop to one of their previous CDs, Washaway, this one lacks some of the unpolished roots ska sound. Still, this CD is a good selection for big Israelites fans as well as dedicated first-wave ska listeners."
2,Bad picture,"I purchased the Creative Webcam Instant w/Free Headset as a special Thanksgiving sale from amazon. The headset is easy to use and the audio quality is very good. However, the webcam is crappy and gives very blurry pictures. I also own a Logitech webcam for work and it is surprising to note that there is a mismatch between the software compatibility of the two webcams. Apparently, I cannot use them simultaneously. As a result, I use only the Creative headset for voice chats and have stopped using its webcam.If you are planning to get a webcam for personal use, better try a Logitech: the price is similar, but the picture quality is far superior!"
2,"Flimsy, barely ok technology when this was a new product in the market",Easy to install and use.Three legged setup did not work well on CRT or LCD that well. One of the front legs broke off fairly easily and had to rely on tapes to hold it in place.Software that came with it was the quiet useful though it did not work well with some of the messengers all the time.Camera adjustment dial was hard to use. Too hard and slippery to use.
1,Get something else,"I got this for $10, but it was too much. This webcam provides very poor quality video. Even with things close-up, you will never get the picture focused enough to be better than blurry. I had no trouble with installation of software with WinXP."
4,Creative Webcam great bargain,"Images are great. I purchased 3 webcams to use with laptop computers. Only problem is with the adjustment when mounted on the laptop display. A previously purchased unit can be easily adjusted while these units are too loose and can't be adjusted. The screw that controls the adjustment is tightened all the way but the unit ""flops"" to the full open position."
2,Garbage!,Garbage. Picture quality is bad. only positive is looks. it looks nice! my old intel webcam is much superior to this.
2,Poorly balanced,"The claws are supposed to let you fix it to a laptop. Unfortunately, the grip is not steady. The rubber studs came off and it got worse from there on. It was one hand on the camera and one hand of the keyboard from the on."
1,the webcam is poor picture quality,"i got this webcam for free after rebate. however, i never used the webcam again after i first opened this poor picture webcam. buy other webcam and don't waste your time and money on this."
2,Eh,"Even though it is cheap, the product seems to be cheaper. I couldn't get majority of the features it came with to even work. The camera works when it decides its ready. I wasn't sure if I should buy this camera and I looked at all the reviews I could find to try and help me. And I'd have to say its definitely not worth the buy, I would prefer to have spent more money and gotten a different hopefully better product. If your really strapped for cash I'd say sure ok buy it. But if your not go ahead and spend the extra cash for something that will last."
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE!,"I really wish I could choose 0 stars! The pictures and the view is terrible. The free headset is no good too, you get what you pay for!! I cannot believe Amazon would even sell something like this!"
2,Don't use it for Notebooks,"Enough said about bad picture quality. I bought this camera to be used on top of the notebook. When I was looking at the pictures on the internet, I didn't pay attention to the fact that screen of the notebook is under right angle to the table. Well, it so happened that this is the only way you may make this camera look forward, on you. If you are like me and have your notebook's screen slighly pushed back - the camera will look up into the sky. This third leg, officially called ""hinged lever"" can't hold it; looks like it misses a spring that would hold it in the normal position. Don't buy it if you plan to install it on the notebook - it won't work."
1,Buy something else.,Terrible driver support(no Vista or Linux support). Bad picture quality.Grip is no good as well .
1,"A big letdown after ""The Flanders Panel""","I had a hard time following the story of this book. Corso is an uninteresting protagonist. Irene is just there to provide the sexual tension and the sex (what the hell did she see in Corso to sleep with him anyway?). The supporting characters are so one-dimensional that I got them confused with each other. Toward the end, I had forgotten what mystery they were trying to solve in the first place! Save your money."
3,"Interesting, but not nearly as good as it could have been","I was mostly annoyed by this book. I was drawn in by the characters, which are certainly interesting characters, and I very much enjoyed some parts of the story arc. Overall however, I found the writing pretentious (quite possibly because it was written in Spanish and things are always lost in translation), and in the end I just never really saw the connections. I have lots of unanswered questions. A fairly quick read, and worth checking out if you're a book nerd, but I didn't think it was as great as some others believe it to be.Found it interesting however that it was the basis for The Ninth Gate with Johnny Depp that came out 8 years ago."
3,Club Dumas,"The book trade and the Devil, arguably never very far apart in the first place, meet in this literary mystery novel.I read this after watching the movie The Ninth Gate which is based on it, and I actually liked the movie better, because it had more artistic unity -- also because, since I don't personally care for the works of Dumas very much, the fact that the movie left that whole plot thread out was fine with me. I suspect not all viewers/readers would feel the same.I thought CD was an intelligent and interesting book, a bit awkwardly phrased at times as I find literature in translation tends to be, though there were also some nice images. I would have liked it to be a bit more emotionally involving. It would appeal, I think, to people who like Dunning's book-trade mysteries, and who read Dumas, and there's also a sideways connection to Mary Gentle's excellent novel 1610: A Sundial In A Grave. I liked CD enough to seek out the author's other work."
3,It's too full of itself.,"I started out loving this book. It had intrique, interesting characters, exciting locations, and a promising plot. I even enjoyed the literary references. Somewhere near the middle of the book I began to tire of it all. Yes, you can feel very clever when you know all the references. Nonetheless, I still think that a book has to have a compelling plot to deserve more than three stars. This book started with a lot of potential and ended as just an average book."
4,Club Dumas,"I bought this book 10 years ago when the movie ""The Ninth Gate"" came out. I find myself re-reading it at least once a year. Arturo's other books haven't wowed me as much or given me that feel of old Europe and mystery I get from this one. I may, once my Spanish improves dramatically, get a hardback copy in the original language and see how I enjoy that."
3,A Bit Above Average,"A reasonably well plotted and written mystery with overtones of the supernatural. Perez-Reverte uses pursuit of a long obscured esoteric mystery related to devil worship as the central feature of the plot. The characterization is above average but the inclusion of a second parallel plot involving Dumas' Three Musketeers is a bit too clever. An undemanding, long air travel type of book."
2,Wonderful book ...Lousy Kindle edition,"I read this book a number of years ago and loved it! It still has a wonderful ability to draw me into the world of these characters - fictional and ""fictional"". However, the Kindle edition is full of typographic errors (ironic given that the novel is all about books and lovers of books and stories!). Misspelled words (bad OCR?) and lack of punctuation abound! The two stars are because of the Kindle edition of a five star book."
2,Kindle version is full of mistakes.,"Amazon should be ashamed to sell this on Kindle.There are so many OCR mistakes that it becomes hard to read at times.For instance, every single instance of ""rain"" in the book is spelled ""ram"".Lots of missing punctuation that often causes you to double take as well.There really should be some sort of quality control as they rush to convertall their books to Kindle.By the way, the story is good. I hate to give it a bad rating, but I feel something must be said."
2,The Club Dumas,"THE CLUB DUMAS, by Perez-Reverte....I had a difficult time getting INTO this story. The author's characters were not very interesting to me....may be to others but not to me. His character descriptions and his general descriptions of scenes and people seemed like they were written by someone who was working overtime at being creative...they didn't ""feel"" natural or ""genuine""....more contrived, as though the writer was a student in a composition class who was trying to impress an instructor. This purchase was just fine in terms of getting what I paid for...the physical condition of the book was very good...delivery time was excellent. I just did NOT like the book. I read it because it was being discussed by my book club. I think part of the reason I disliked it so much was that I had a hard time getting in to it so it felt like a READING ASSIGNMENT rather than an enjoyable read....It's a book I would not have finished if it had not been an ""assignment.'"
3,The Club Dumas,"Sometimes I like it when the author plays with my head, but this one irritated me a bit. I also hate the idea of old rare volumes needlessly being destroyed."
4,What fun! Curl up and be engaged...,"With high marks in reviews in The New Yorker, The New York Times, and the Atlantic Monthly, this murder mystery is a magnificent ""intellectual's 'beach' novel"". Translated from Spanish, the story is generally about the trials of a somewhat shady book 'detective', Lucas Corso, whose specialty is in first edition, rare edition, and out of print rare books. This being a somewhat more competitive and unethical industry than one might think, the mystery draws the reader in be cleverly weaving a series of literary puzzles and clues. The thread of Dumas' famous novel, ""The Three Musketeers"", as well as the study of demonology trace Corso's search for the motive and the murderer of a wealthy bibliophile. The end is a good surprise, and I am looking forward to the next novel by this crafty Spaniard."
3,To the Initiated: this review contains Spoilers.,"I liked the book and the way it was built on earlier works. The part played by Mr. Balkan was genuinely surprising, to say the least. If I had entertained any notions as to the identity of the murderer, the last pages caught me off guard & wondering; that, in all likelihood, was Perez-Reverte's intention.The role of Devil in the book must have owed to the mentioned literary reference, as did most of the characters to theirs. The ultimately anti-climatic ending was a nice touch, making it far stronger than the ending of ""The Flanders Panel"", but some threads of the story were, on occasion, loose; hence the 3 stars instead of 4."
3,"Starts very well, but falls apart later","I liked this a lot at first, but he leaves too many loose ends, loses the characters and atmosphere at the end. And the ending is a big disappointment."
5,"Great, but not for those looking for a regular mystery","Perez-Reverte combines the most interesting of elements to creat a great plot. However, if one is looking for your typical 'who-dunnit' stay clear. This book is more apt for the latin scholar."
3,A Labyrinth With No Minotaur,"The Club Dumas starts of great. It's style is engrossing, it's intricately plotted, and there is an amazing amount of historical detail packed into this one volume. I had no idea what an extraordinary achievement the art of bookmaking was, and what it took to bring the written word to the world, and keep that flame burning despite all the fears and hatreds that threatened to snuff it out. As a historical novel it worked great. Unfortunately, for me it didn't work so well as a mystery. The problem I think is that there are several stories running through, none of which are given as much attention as necessary, and none of them reach a completely satisfying conclusion. Red herrings are great, but too much of anything is liable to give you a tummyache. As it is, while I admire the craftsmanship, in terms of entertainment I felt cheated. Still worth a read for the engrossing literary details."
4,"Interesting, keeps you guessing....a real page turner","I thought that the Club Dumas was an excellent summer read: definitely a good book to have at the beach! I really liked the development of the characters but I thought that more time should have been devoted to some of the more sinister characters. And the girl that kept appearing....what was the deal with her? Who was she really? Overall I thought the book was great, the plot was interesting and kept me in suspense, but in the end, it was sort of like a Stephen King movie: you're not really sure what actually happened. I thought the ending was rather incomplete. Too many questions left unanswered. However, I felt that the plot and the main character were enough to carry it to an interesting climax and conclusion. The only thing that I didn't like about Club Dumas was that the ending was too vague. I have recommended Club Dumas as a good summer read to friends and collegues."
5,Awsome. A fascinating novel,"A very good narration with a very surprising ending. The game of the emotions and the action are extraordinary well described. Now, a forty six year old man attracted to a girl old enough to be his daughter, and vice versa? Corso must have had a fantasy. Now Polanski's version of the NINTH GATE will be a real challenge to keep up with the book which inspired him."
3,Anticlimactic,"An interesting framework that combines elements of Dumas, Sherlock Holmes, Phillip Marlowe, and The Da Vinci Code that, at least for me, didn't quite work.I actually thought The Club Dumas started out quite well - I flew through the first 100 pages thoroughly engrossed in the story as the mystery was established, but unfortunately it fell flat as it unfolded, in my opinion. Quite simply, I found the resolution of the various questions/mysteries raised anticlimactic.I will admit I did appreciate finding as many references to Dumas, Conan Doyle, and other works as I could (I'm sure there are a lot I missed, I'm not all that well-read), but for me that didn't make up for a relatively flat story. I did not, on the other hand, appreciate the frequently awkward attempts at Chandlerian similes.At the risk of stating the obvious, if you're thinking of reading this I would, at the very least, be sure to read The Three Musketeers first."
4,Bibliophiles love this one!,"Having read The Flanders Panel, I couldn't wait to read another one of Arturo Perez-Reverte's books. This great author strikes gold again with The Club Dumas. Based on Dumas' masterpiece The Three Musketeers, Perez-Reverte weaves his own tale of rare book collecting and the history surrounding the Musketeers. While I suggest that you read The Three Musketeers first, (I didn't and for that reason I often lost track of the plot, hence the four-star rating) the novel was still interesting without any knowledge of Dumas' work. But this novel is full of the clever and dark writing that I loved in Panel. Perez-Reverte is one of the most brilliant authors of today and I look forward to reading more of his stuff. Bibliophiles swear by this book. Highly recommended..."
2,Eco's pendulum gets a nasty twist...,"When reading this book one cannot ignore the influence of two great writers: the one is Umberto Eco, whose style and Idea, as well as the way of writing surely reflect through the writing of Reverte; the other is Hermann Hesse in his Nobel Prize winning book The Glass Bead Game [Das Glasperlenspiel], a book which, I suspect, is not known to Reverte. Alas, this current book does not stand in the standard of such great Novelists. Though the plot seems to be very 'intelligent' to say the least (through citations and so forth), the end is very badly written, the whole subject of enjoyment from this book is thus questioned. I wouldn't advise reading this book if you're an intellectual."
2,Almost Mediocre,"Oh! how I was desperate to like this book. Especially since it was my bathtub reading. And especially, especially since I was reading The Three Musketeers at the same time (as my nighttime reading). I just never got into the character of Corso as much as I'd have liked. Though the ending is alright, the middle of the book was too hard to get through--nothing dangerous, nothing interesting, only mildly intriguing, nothing that would make one to want to continue reading. I hope you like it more than I."
2,Overly complicated and uninteresting plot; boring chars.,"I barely made it through this book. For me it was incredibly boring. The plot lines were complicated, but that's OK. I figured I'd get it at some point; never did and never did care if I did! What was particularly odd is that there really are two different intertwined plots or stories and you keep wondering how they're going to be inter-related. By the end of the book (if you make it) you discover the secret -- they're NOT! I really dis-liked this book, found it boring and the characters uninteresting and flat. Two stars is a really generous rating..."
4,Not the Ninth Gate... better,"I picked up this book because I enjoyed the movie. As usual, it was much better than the movie. The book had another plot that the movie never touches, one which I found even more entertaining. Unfortunately, I found that the book left me asking just as many questions as the movie did. I only give it four stars because I found that the author was a little long-winded at times. Enjoy!"
2,"Delicious, then irritating","I was lovin' this book up to the scene where the title's meaning is revealed. Loved the nine pairs of woodcuts, each with one tiny, crucial difference; loved the history of book-bindings and -burnings. Loved the meditations on the greatness of Dumas and other swashbuckling trash; loved the allusions to Sherlock Holmes. I was hooked, for a while, on the occult events, baroque settings, and twisty plot. But the ending was the lamest ""faux-po-mo"" cop-out imaginable. Bah humbug! I said, and threw the book across the room. I exchanged it for ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""A Scandal in Bohemia."""
2,A cross between the 39 steps and Da Vinci Code,"Lacks the intensity and perpetual motion of Da Vinci code. Starts off on an interesting premise, but misses the home run by the mile. Characters lack depth. An ok weekend read, but good details for Dumas fans."
2,Too Much Esoterica,"After reading 4 other books by this author, I am very disappointed by The Club Dumas. It is not up to his past standard of story telling.Got about 100 pages in and I figure there was only about 15- 20 pages of story and the rest all extremely detailed bibliographies or footnotes from reference books. So many details - where's the story???"
4,Fabulous book except for the last 100 pages,"Club Dumas had me engrossed from page one. I love nothing better than reading about old books and if you throw a mystery in on top, I'm hooked. However, like those who have expressed an opinion before me, I thought the ending was a big let down. I also thought the character known only as 'the girl' added nothing to the story. I had imagined as I was reading that she may have been an undercover policewoman or something of the sort following Corso in order to solve Enrique's hanging. However, in the end, she turned out to be nothing at all. You could have wiped her from the book and noone would have noticed. I understand that Hollywood is making a movie based on this book. I believe it is to star Johnny Depp. Should be interesting to see it on the big screen."
3,Almost a masterpiece.,"Compared to the first Perez-Reverte book I read (The Flanders Panel), this was more interesting and entertaining. In fact, all the twists and turns of the mystery almost made me love the book - it was a great idea to print the pictures, so that the reader could also take part in solving the riddle. And I think the romance between Corso and ""Irene"" was beautifully described, if not most believable.But I have to agree with other reviewers about the ending. It's all too clear that the author didn't even know himself what he should do with all the loose ends. The Nine Doors sideplot never really fit in with the Club Dumas plot. The ending was all the more disappointing since I had already started believing that Perez-Reverte had some wonderful surprise reserved for the last pages. Well, at least this book was interesting and original."
3,Too Vague,"This book was impressively complex -- with the author's obvious deep research into old books and writers.Of course, it helps if you've read ""The Three Musketeers."" I wish I had. I probably would have appreciated this book more.The build up was exciting, but the ending was a little too watered down. What happened? Who was the girl? Who had sent her? Was I missing something?"
2,"Enjoyed ""The Flanders Panel"" better.","After having enjoyed ""The Flanders Panel"", I was looking forward to ""The Club Dumas"", and was hooked by the first chapter. I found the storylines of bibliophiles, the occult, and especially the possible forgery of the books intriguing. However, it all fell apart after the revelation of the sham Club Dumas, and just got worse when the final plotlines were revealed. I found the ending to be unclear and convoluted. Readers would be much better off reading ""The Eight"" by Katherine Neville. However, I still intend to give ""The Seville Communion"" a try."
3,"Story was okay, but e-book rife with typos, missing punctuation, etc.","The story was okay, and fun for someone familiar with classic serial adventure novels. Overall, this is quick beach reading for someone who likes Dumas.The e-book itself, though, was filled with mistakes -- missing punctuation for entire paragraphs at a time (the only way you could tell a sentence ended was through capitalized letters), misspellings (""rain"" always came up as ""ram"", ""Dürer"" as ""Diirer"", and so on), and references to pages in the books discussed (it is a book about books, so this is a frequent occurrence) are seen by the Kindle as references to pages within the e-book and show up as links rather than, say, ""page 32."" I blame terrible OCR and a lack of proofreading on the part of the publisher. Granted, it was only $1.99, but I can see why it was, and all other Perez-Reverte titles are over $10."
4,"Worth Reading, But Not Great","The Club Dumas is a novel filled with great ideas, subplots, and literary intersections. However, the book really lacks direction. It does not seem to know whether it is a novel dealing with theology, the nature of literature, or some combination of both. The main character, Lucas Corso, is very interesting indeed. And although some of his actions appear morally reprehensible, the author manages to make him likeable. I did care about Corso, but I could not help but feel let down by an ending that leaves too many loose ends, unanswered questions, and a somewhat vague conclusion."
3,Plot and (unfortunately) then some.,"The plot of Club Dumas kept me turning the pages until the end. But because I found the characters and relationships unreal and annoying, I found myself skimming over those many scenes that were unimportant to the plot.The plot involving lovers of books, lovers of reading, and lovers of both is involved and compelling. But I found the relationships, and especially the sex, filled with cliches and hardly necessary to the story.Ultimately, the read was unsatifying and more of a time-killer. If you're looking for a book for a plane ride it might be the ticket though."
1,Don't Buy the Kindle Edition,"This is the first Kindle book i bought and I was shocked. The Kindle edition is full of typos, missing punctuation, missing words, mispelled words, misplaced quotation marks, etc. Obviously this has never been proofed. The books that I have downloaded up to know have been free classics. They were, in general, very good. This edition, however, is chock full of errors.I have scanned the other reviews and there is no mention of this. Is this then only occuring on my Kindle, or is the Kindle communinty completely tolerant of these types of problems?Since there are no live human beings at Amazon, it will likely remain a mystery. I don't even really know how to take a Kindle book back for a refund.From a literary standpoint, read the other reviews. The are generally representative of my views. You can live a full life without reading this book."
4,Cuando la narración supera la historia,"Si algo tiene Pérez-Reverte es la capacidad de atrapar al lector en una narración perfecta y mejor uso del castellano. No importa si la historia, o el cuento, sirve de algo...no importa, pero que siga escribiendo. Leerlo es un placer para cualquier amante de la buena escritura. En este caso, la buena escritura se combina con el ingenio, y el lector avizado podrá sentirse parte, y hasta encontrarse como personaje entre líneas."
3,Pretty good,"I have to say that this book set itself up extremely well. I also really like the main character, Corso, as well as all of the characters that the author surrounded him with. Unfortunately, even though this book untangled its many webs pretty well, it still got caught up towards the end. Overall, great setup and great characters, but the final delivery was weak. The finale was not as disappointing as the movie (ALL of which was bad except for Depp's accurate portrayal of Corso), but it was not as good as it should've been."
4,A book lover's mystery,"If you love books and mysteries and insecure anti-heroes, you'll like The Club Dumas. It's a stylish, noir thriller set in the world of European antiquarian book collecting spiced with a bit of devil worship. What more could you ask for on a rainy day?"
2,"""Uncle""","I will make this short and sweet. I gave it my all till page 142 and then cried ""uncle."" Worst book ever."
1,A Study In Boredom-A Weekend At The Club Dumas.,"While reading The Club Dumas it became painfully obvious why only seven people saw Johnny Depp's movie adaptation of the book. Slow and tedious in sections, I found myself wishing that I could cut my wrists with the pages to end the horror. What is ultimately the true source of frustration is that this book has so much potential. A deal with the devil, a mysterious vixen, an international search for a demonic book, ohhh, the wasted potential.Look elsewhere for a good read. I feel for those who judge this as an intellectual mystery. Please. In the end the bad guy all along is unmasked as... the evil mastermind! The mysterious girl is... mysterious! I would continue, but I must go translate my review into Spanish so as to save the readers of the Spanish version."
1,I am I the only one who thought this book sucked???,"Five-stars? Pérez-Reverte a genius?? mystery for intellectuals??? Are you freaking kidding me. When a movie, which is its self mediocre, easily bests its sourse text in terms of plot, character development and style what more can you say. On a scale of 0-10 I give this book one mark above the Da Vinci Code: a one. If you want to read a book that is actually deserving of this trumpted up spew/hype then check out Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose.The Name of the Rose (Everyman's Library (Cloth))"
2,Yawn...,"I'm not a frustrated comparative literature major stuck in a dead-end job whose only creative outlet seems to be posting reviews on Amazon, so I won't bore you with five-star words.But I am a magazine editor and voracious reader--so I know what I like. If you are looking for a taut, thrilling, suspenseful, character-driven mystery, look elsewhere. I got to page 237 and had only experienced one pulse-quickening episode, when the protagonist, Corso, is chased for a few seconds down a narrow street by a menacing driver. He slips out of the way at the last moment and bumps his poor, widdle hand.If you are intrigued by leather book bindings and obscure 16th century demonology, you'll happily breeze through the first 237 pages. As for me, I'm giving up on this snoozer for now."
2,I kept putting it down...,"I would not have finished this book were I not reading it for my bookgroup. We generally found The characters unsympathetic, the writing style confusing, and the ending unsatisfying. Others liked it somewhat better than I, but would only recommend it with plenty of disclaimers and warnings. The woodcuts were fun, though, and the mystery was intriguing for awhile (but a subig let down at the end."
2,"Oh, come on. Who cares?","I finished the Club Dumas and I'm wondering why anyone cares. The plot is ridiculous. Some greedy and somewhat sleazy book merchant chases all over the Iberian peninsula and France for two books that will supposedly summon the Devil while a bunch of Eurosnobs plot to keep a handwritten chapter of a Dumas book from public scrutiny - all the while belonging to a club that reprints ancient dime novels? Minute details about book collecting overwhelmed me with tears of boredom. There's the stereotypical fetching young woman who all we know about is that she uses a name from a Sherlock Holmes story and is a kick boxer of some talent because she can beat up an actor? Meanwhile, the evil ""pay no attention to the man behind the curtains"" guy surfaces only briefly at beginning an end. And if I read the word ""apocryphal"" one more time I would have puked. The ending, especially the last page, is so trite I would have expected it to come from a John Grisham novel. And I LIKE John Grisham."
2,"Well written, but hard to follow and incredibly boring","I ordered the book based on all the great Amazon reviews, but I really don't know what inspired me to ever finish it. It took me about six months of on again/off again reading (with three other great books in between). I just didn't care about any of the characters, perhaps don't know enough about literary history to understand all the small talk and references, too many characters that the only ones I could keep track of were Corso and ""the girl"" (and yet we never really find out who the girl is). Ugh. I wouldn't subject anyone to this book unless they were just a literary nut."
2,Frustrating Plot,"This may be a ""beach book for intellectuals"", but it is certainly not one for the less sophisticated reader who just likes a good read. Those of us without a solid foundation in medieval satanic practices and a PhD in literature might have trouble with all the allusions. And for the mystery lover, there are too many red herrings and enough loose ends to knit a sweater. Even the sub-plot of Corso and the green-eyed beauty seemed gratuitous and implausible."
2,Sloppy and overrated.,"The Club Dumas is a mediocre detective story dressed up with literary references. The style is by turns overwrought and predictable. The characters, with one or two exceptions, lack any depth at all. And mistakes appear everywhere: the narrator slips and refers to himself in the third person, a one-armed woman tears a page out of a book and rips it into tiny pieces, ""clausae patent"" is translated as ""they will open that which is closed,"" woodcuts are continually referred to as engravings, etc., etc. I cannot recommend this."
2,Horrible.,"I expected more. A lot more. This book was vastly irritating. Here's the short version of my grievances:1/3 of this book is taken up with grating, failed Raymond Chandler-type descriptions of the various facial expressions the main character makes, and how they resemble various woodland creatures such as rabbits and wolves. All of this nonsense perplexed me until I looked at the author's picture on the dust jacket. He looks kind of like a bunny.1/3 of it is taken up with him being menaced by a shadowy group of sinister RENAISSANCE FAIR TYPES who act out ""The Three Musketeers"". ooo, spooky. I realized about halfway through that this book was little more than a fancy Nancy Drew mystery.1/3 of it deals with someone finding a book that summons satan. Not bad, if done right. Not done right.None of these goofy plot threads have much to do with each other, and the whole thing comes across as an attempt at an Umberto Eco book written by a college student."
2,The Club Dumas,"This book looked like a winner: a novel about about books. Set in Spain, Portugal, and Paris and featuring an odd, yet likable protaganist, it opens with an enticing prologue. The narrative style is intriguing; it's written as an account by one of the characters. The reader is given a strong, Agatha Christie-esque hint about the end. But the novel simply peters out. The intrigue is lost. It wallows in melodrama, perhaps imitating in some unfulfilling way the works of Dumas himself. I wanted to be surprised, enchanted, or even shocked. But instead I was just bored."
3,An OK Thriller... but you won't miss much if you skip it,"Arturo Perez-Reverte is an exceptional writer. His writing is witty and intelligent, and reflects the author's extensive knowledge of classic books and their characters. In fact, the reason I read the book was that I am a big fan of The Three Musketeers. But the book is not as suspenseful as I would have liked, and the characters are not very engaging. This is especially true for the girl, whose identity and motives are more than a bit vague. Moreover, the author goes too much into the subject of devil worship, which I found to be quite unpleasant. Halfway through the book I started to loose interest, and it became increasingly challenging to keep on reading. The last twenty pages were especially tiresome; when the twist was finally revealed on the last page, I was too bored to care about anything and as a result I was not very impressed."
2,I could have lived without this one.,"Don't bother. The characters in this book are very one dimensional. Corso is a cliche sleazebag, the man he works for is a cliche rich-guy-does-occult, and ""the girl"" is a cliche mysterious beauty. The only thing vaguely interesting about this book is the little pieces of information about old books and the woodcuts. Very disappointing ending."
2,Perez-Reverte comes undone.,"The Flanders Panel was book with such a compelling story that many of the ridiculous idiosyncaries could be masked. Not so with Perez-Reverte's second effort. The absurdities are blown up ten-fold, showing the style for what it is -- basic noir. As with the last book, it's well wrapped in ""art"". The first, great paintings; with this, great literature (What next -- a Mozart scandal? Rand?). But the booze and cigarettes, guys on the run, sympathetic dames with big breasts in seedy bars, men with too-young women, show the fine line that the author has been treading. This time, he went to far. The story is interesting, but at times totally ridiculous. Pass on this one. And find out with the third book what this author is really worth"
4,Perez-Reverte does it again.,"Once again, the author writes a book that has you guessing right up to the very end. His books never disappoint. What was disappointing was that no one seems to have proofed this book after sending it through the OCR software. I don't know how many times Paris became Pans. Many, many of these errors making it difficult to read at times. Punctuation disappears and words are restructured. Very distracting. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars."
5,excellent,"fantastic and very intelligent book.twists everywhere it possibly can and leaves you wanting a sequel immediately.a must for anyone that actually still reads books that are not about some "" celebrity "" ."
4,The Club Dumas,"this was an enjoyable book for the most part throughout, especially for someone who loves books! i was just a bit annoyed by the ending, it seemed kind of hokey when the book overall had been on a bit of a higher level. i haven't seen the movie based on this book so i'll have to watch it now and see how it compares."
3,interesting but difficult to follow,"A book merchant (with whom is difficult to related to) sets out to track copies of an ancient book which supposedly contains information as to how to summon the devil. This is story is related to subplot involving the authenticity of a chapter from the 3 Musketeers. There is a plethora of information on antique books and on Dumas. The plot is not bad, although the book is tiresome to read. The Seville Communion is a much better book! If you are interested in this author, I recommend that one over the Dumas Club."
3,"Occult undertones intriguing, but the rest?","Club Dumas entertains with its sundry of interesting information about Alexander Dumas, his serials and the selective world of the rare book. The occult undertones and puzzles added extra tantilization. But other than that, the story of a jaded book detective, his penchant for a mystery Lolita and their involvement with a group of characters who have confused their identities to the point where they are acting out parts of Dumas' 3 Musketeers, was trite and like the outcome in 'The Flanders Panel' predictable. Rebirth occurs in the onion layers of young flesh? Come on-what were all the spectacular reviews about? Methinks most folk assume that when they read a novel with the scholarly undertones of Umberto Eco, automatically they have 'arrived' on that plane where those who prefer the commercially successful genre of Grisham et al can never reach. This author exploits that need for pseudo intelligence."
4,I had no idea what I was getting into,"When you start reading this book, it takes you a while to realize everything is actually happening in the XXe century. The prose, the characters, the enigma makes you wonder if you have not fallen on an old classic. The author has this way of joining future and past that is highly surprising and effective.This is not a mystery novel. This is a literary novel. The presence of the mystery seems there only to support a chase for a book, but it is at the same time refreshing.This book made me want to go back to my old bookshelves and get out all the Dumas I could find to read them again... with a new perspective."
4,A Refreshing and Entertaining Read,"I read this book many years after seeing the movie ""The 9th Gate"" several times. I had always been intrigued by the movie and finally managed to read the book. It should be noted that the movie didn't follow the book all that closely. The Club Dumas is much more intriguing and complex. If you liked the movie, you must absolutely read the book, as the characters are much more interesting. Perez-Reverte's writing style is astoundingly refreshing. As an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction, I have to admit that I have not encountered such a rich writing style before. Reverte's attention to detail is stunning and astonishing without being dull. It hearkens back to the old 'dark detective' style of writing while remaining invigorating throughout. I am now hooked and will begin reading some of Reverte's other works."
4,The Three Musketeers would be proud,"Arturo Perez-Reverte effortly melds the plot of "" The Club Dumas"" with the characters of ""The Three Musketeers"". His mysteries work on different levels. He has quickly become one of my favorite authors. Arturo Perez-Reverte has joined the ranks of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez as one of my favorite storytellers."
3,A Slower-Paced Thriller from the Old Days,"This tale of book-hunter Lucas Corso disguises its true purpose -- to wallow in its love of Dumas and Dumas-styled adventures -- by hiding in the trappings of mystery, murder conspiracies and demonology. Perez-Reverte does a nice job of juggling his many characters and plot elements and illuminating the literary touchstones that act as guideposts through the plot. His ability to build atmosphere and layer mood into his scenes is quite effective. The amibiguous nature of the Irene Adler character is both infuriating and well-handled. In the end, the reader can almost believe that there is redemption in Corso's path toward damnation."
3,Doesn't quite hang together,"A book acquirer -- buyer if possible, thief if necessary -- gets sent on a slightly metafictive mission. He's an interesting character, obsessed with recreating the battle of Waterloo so that Napoleon wins, but a bit emotionally distant from the action. There's one plot that's all about The Three Musketeers and another plot that's all about summoning the devil. The one about the Three Musketeers is all a bit crossword-puzzley and precious. The one about summoning the devil is more interesting, but the tone of the book is slightly wrong for it -- it never quite makes you scared the way it should, everything is too prosaic and brightly lit, and there are no shadows for interesting things to hide in, though there's a blunt, casual sexiness that creeps in every so often that I quite liked."
5,Great book. Great author.,"Loved the book, which was the basis for the Roman Polanksi directed movie THE NINTH GATE, starring Johnny Depp. The movie strips away the literary fun and mystery of members of an elite club (of the title) imitating characters in Dumas' fiction and focuses on the protagonist's hunt for the satanic book, but is an intriguing film nonetheless. The book is a satisfying, engaging page-turner. Think Umberto Eco light."
3,"Not As Good As The Hype, But Entertaining Nonetheless","I'm not a big mystery fan. But, having read several glowing reviews about The Dumas Club, I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about. It didn't take long for me to see why others liked this book. Perez-Reverte does a masterful job of setting the mood and ratcheting up the tension throughout the story. What's more, his development of the story's protagonist, Lucas Corso, is strong enough to cause the reader to become emotionally attached to Corso as he moves through this mystery. Still, the ending is a letdown after such a good build-up. Additionally, Perez-Reverte's incessant ""title-dropping"" of obscure books was a bit less clever than what it was likely intended to be. In the end, these flaws left me believing that The Dumas Club is not as good as the hype would lead one to suppose. Still, if approached with lower expectations, it will provide the reader with a good diversion for a few hours or days."

1,"Paul Heaton is surely a great singer, BUT... With The Beautiful South!","Since I discovered The Beautiful South back in 2001, I became a fan of this extraordinary English band!Searching in different Web pages more information about them, I found out that the 'engine' of this band was this guy, Paul Heaton.Sure he's really a good singer-songwriter, but in this solo effort... Having read all the things that other Music reviewers said about him, I surely expected something by far, much better than what he has recorded in this album.So, I really think that Mr. Heaton should consider to reunite with The Beautiful South buddies once again..."
3,Enchanting but still needs work.....,"I've tried one or two other Gena Showalter books but have not been able to finish them. This was the first one I'd finished and enjoyed. Although I do have some issues about the story development.Firstly, what is the connection between Jewel and Gray as both of them have been having visions about each other whilst growing up. This connection was not fully explored!Secondly, there was insufficient background on Jewel's past and the rush of memories at the end of the book left me unsatisfied.Lastly, I'm a big fan of alpha male heroes in romances but it would have been good if Gray had had much more in-depth thoughts other than sex on his brain ALL the time!All in all, in was an entertaining read and I enjoyed the introduction to the world of Atlantis. It's whet my appetite enough that I want to try Heart of the Dragon next!"
3,can't decide,"I like paranormal series, but I hate reading a story when I think the characters do or say something that seem stupid or ridiculous. (I know, the fact that I like paranormal is by itself ridiculous but you must understand or you wouldn't be reading this review) so I am not completely sold on this series. Sometimes I don't like how the story develops and the characters behave, other times it is very entertaining. I give it three stars."
5,Wonderful story of adventure!,"I recently discovered Gena Showalter last year and once I read a couple of her books, I could not stop myself from buying the others just to read her fantastic tales!Gena gets into the heads of her characters so well that she literally brings them to life. Every time I read one of her books, the characters just seem to pop out and I can actually imagine them in my head as I go through the book.With Gray and Jewel, these two were a wonderful, passionate pair. His need to help the damsel, but never really letting his greed get in the way of what he truely wants. You feel his pain, you feel hers and you can not help but root for them and then feel like you want to slap them for making the bad decision, heh. I love the humor that Gena has herself and that she places in her characters to really make the characters and the story interesting.Thank you Gena!"
3,"fast paced,fun","Start with heart of the dragon (book 1) This series is fast paced,fun,comic at times and everyone in atlantis is geared for sex.Great for a quick read. I was compelled to skip a couple of pages at times,but I went back."
4,something was different,"I read through the book pretty fast. I really enjoyed it until I got closer to the end.The characters are great.It is very predictable, but I love Gena Showalter's writing.The ending was very anti-climatic."
3,"Good, but not as good as I hoped","This book did not quite live up to others of Ms. Showalter's books I have read. I skipped through several times, and had a difficult time warming up to the characters. I will keep this one simply because I have others of hers; however, it will not be re-read as the others are."
4,Amazing storyteller,"The ""Jewel"" is first mentioned in ""Heart of the Dragon"". Both books are a must read."
1,Ugh....I must have read a different book again?,"I didn't like this novel at all. I was completely BORED!!!!! I am not going to waste any more of my time thinking about this story. Instead I want to warn anyone who's thinking of buying it, not too! I do recommend Book #3, The Nymph King, a but much better read than this."
3,It's a Showalter Book,"If you've read Showalter books before, you'll get exactly what you expected with this book. It's entertaining for some good reasons and a lot of wrong reasons."
4,Enter Atlantis...,"This is the second book by Gena Showalter I have read. The first was Heart of the Dragon, which is also set in Atlantis.The Jewel of Dunamis is a very sought after item. The Jewel is not a real jewel at all, but a demi-goddess with the gift of prophecy. She can be a powerful weapon. Gray James is an agent from the surface, sent to retrieve the Jewel of Dunamis unaware that she is a beautiful woman.A recommended read that I would give 4.5 stars to if possible. I couldn't help but compare it to Heart of the Dragon which I really really liked a lot!"
3,You are the weakest link,"Jewel of Atlantis is the 2nd of a (so far) 3 books series on the peoples of Atlantis and in my opinion is so far the weakest link. The characters interacted with each other fine, but individually were developed in a very strange way. There was no real explanation of why they dreamed of each other and no real explanation of what the hero, Grayson James, was going to do with his part-demon, part-vampire self in the ""human world"" the book just ended in a very harsh way."
5,One reason I'm no longer a Christian,"This book deserves the title ""classic"" as much as any other. At one point during the middle ages it was more widely read than the Bible. Its essential message is that when Christ said ""deny yourself...and follow me"" he was being literal. By which I mean: if you are not already living a saintly, self-denying, life in a soup kitchen in Calcutta you're not a Christian; just a pretender. This book caused a crisis of faith in me when I read it in college because, religious as I was then, I had no answer to it. It led me to seriously consider becoming a priest before -- with a little help from Nietzche (I wish books could have this kind of impact on me still) I decided that if this is what Christianity demands....no thank you. If you are not religious I think the only point of reading this book is for its historical significance. But if you are a practicing Christian, be ready to question your commitment to your faith."
1,Terrible just plain terrible ...,"There are to bboks in this volume and both of them comete with each other as far as dumbness is concerned...The first book deals with a young British sailor falling of his ship in the Med and ending up at the harem of a very wealth sheik i Morocco .... We then get the life story of sexual awakening of each of the girls in the harem ....You know, reading their very boring stories makes me easily understand why the owner of the harem seldom shows up .....The second bok is so stupid I dont even want to discuss it"
4,Interesting ironies,"I'll be honest, I wasn't sure what to make of this book at first. It took a ""unique"" point of view towards prisons and concentration camps. However, the more I read, the more I saw that Mrazek actually had an ingenious point. One of his chapters highlights how concentration camps in Czechoslovakia and Indonesia actually inadvertently pooled many of those nations' best and brightest peoples, allowing them access to the best doctors and educators. I won't reveal too much more, except to say that this book really challenges you to think daringly about colonialism and power relationships."
3,Not for the American art historian/student,"While I certainly enjoyed the Vanderbilt and Whitney family backgrounds, I found nothing worth noting in this book regarding the early days of the Whitney Museum. I purchased the book because I am writing a research paper on the founding of the Whitney Museum. Alas, the book focuses much on the fate of the Museum after Gertrude Whitney's death. There is very little detail or specifics concerning her role in the Museum, nor that of the main catalyst, Julianna Force.I will say that the book is a good, juicy look into the aristocratic Vanderbilt family, but that's about it.There is focus on later years, but very few details concerning the early days of the Museum.I'll shelve it for now and save it for a rainy day!"
4,Compatible with Rino 530HCx,"It works fine with Rino 530Hcx. There is a single ear ""ear-bud"" = mono speaker. PTT = Push to Talk switch works the way it should with Rino 530. Price is acceptable(not bargain) for what you are getting. Uses 2.5mm 3-conductor plug (Mono speaker + mic)."
2,Need To Return,"I bought two sets of these for our garmin radios that were used during hunting. One worked while the other cut out and didn't seem to operate correctly. I will have to return for an exchange.I have had better quality ear buds for other radios, too bad Garmin couldn't follow the other models."
1,Failure of Earbuds,"Well, I had a couple of problems with the earbuds, first had a difficult time keeping the ubs in the ear, don't know if its my ear or the design of the buds. 2nd, after the first time there was a little water from the rain on it, the mic shorted out and did not work. I also found the line to be a little small for the outdoor hunting, walking through the brush, it gets hung up quite easily."
5,PTT,"Love these little devices. Great while hunting for hands free quiet communication. A must have for any big game hunter! Of course with a new Rhino, too"
1,Terrible product,"These earbud's with mic are the most terrible I have ever used, You can't understand what the other person is saying, it is too muffled, the mic seems to work ok but the earbud sucks, I do not recommend these at all"
2,Tastes Terrible,"I was looking for a no calorie replacement for sugar in my coffee. Based on the reviews, this seemed like an excellent product. About the only good part about this product is that it does sweeten. However, it tastes bad and the aftertaste is even worse. It may be acceptable if you're used to other sugar substitutes, but, sadly it falls very short of sugar."
4,Good for on the go....,"Prefer the KAL Pure Stevia Extract Powder but for the workplace and eating out needed the convenience of packets. It takes more Stevita to sweeten than Kal, however it does the job."
2,Not as good as truvia,"Taste was rather chemical - this product isn't in the same class as truvia. Cheap price shows through, I can tolerate it with more spices but wouldn't buy it again."
1,No stars!,"I tried to submit this with no stars but the review site wouldn't let me. Stevita Supreme is blech . . . yuk . . . awful! BITTER! Very, very bitter! And grainy, too. So far, Truvia is the only stevia product that works for us. But I'd love to find something less expensive."
2,very outdated book,"This guide is based on a few specific projects which have little relevance to today's market. No outlines, guidelines, or checklists were available to help with the process of putting together a complete set of working drawings. If you are already in the field of architecture, this book is too basic and not applicable to more modern projects."
3,"The best book about ""The Storks"" is yet to be written.","I expected to love this book as I am a big fan of Escadrille Spa 3 and had been hoping that someone would write a book about them for some time. However this book is rather dry and is pretty much a recitation of Groupe de Combat 12's combat logs in book form. It encompases all of the Stork squadrons, Escadrilles 3,26,67,73,103,167. I did enjoy it but only because it had info on a subject I was very much interested in. It could have been so much more. You don't get to know the pilots, there is practically no personal information on them. There are many rare photographs, and some nice drawings of aircraft in the back. And it does have a very nice cover. I do hope someone else has a go at this subject and writes the definitive book on the ""Storks"". There is quite a story there, classic triumph and tragedy. Perhaps Dennis Gordon?"
4,"Excellent book,.","Excellent book for those who likes a history of aviation. Contains histoty of Storks for every period of war, list of flying personnel, log book of flights. I enjoyed it."
5,Not for American Idiot posers who don't know Green Day,Old Green Day rocks and this CD proves it! The punk rock and metal fushion rocks! But there should be a parental advisory but who cares? That bascically all you need to know and buy it! It rules!
1,Ouch. MY EARS! arrrggghh! Make.... it..... stop.... please,"This is not a good CD. All the songs sound the same. Being repetitive is not considered one's ""style"", it's considered being stagnant. Oh, and the main reason for the 1 star rating: Billie Joe Hick's voice. Someone PLEASE shut him up. His voice is the equivilant of putting a cheese grater to you ear. Some say he has a ""puppy dog"" way of singing. Yeah, in the sense that it's incessantly annoying. If these guys continue to be the same for any longer they will regress because they sure as heck ain't moving forward. On Nimrod GreenDay didn't branch out because the songs still sound like typical GreenDay. Their Good Riddence song was written even before Dookie came out, and the version of GR that came out on their Stink Breath single sounds just like Words I Might Have Ate from their 1992 CD. With every GreenDay album one thing is certain: You expect more of the same."
5,Great cd,"this cd is a wicked one. green day at there best. one thing to keep in mind though...there are a lot of explicted lyrics, even though it doesn't say explicted lyrics."
4,"What fans have been ""Waiting"" for.","Better punk may have come from the 70's, but ""Green Day"" were the best thing to come out of recent history by far. This collection is 21 tracks long, and has most everything it should. Included is ""Longview"", ""Geek Stink Breath"", ""Nice Guys Finish Last"", and ""Warning"". Plus their slowest, yet biggest hit ""Good Riddance (time of your life)"". Also there's a couple new tracks that hold up to the old stuff pretty well. This collection might not do much for the fanatics, but for casual fans, this should be all the ""Green Day"" you'll ever need. ""Welcome To Paradise""."
4,It's Great but whats the Point,"Ok, Green day is my favorite band of all time. I've been listining to them since I heard Kerplunk when I was 12. I only bought I.S.for the two new songs, and there great. The rest of it though is why bother. Unless, your only a fan of their radio hits then this is the one that you've all been waiting for to save your money from buying all of their amazing albums. Can't wait for Shenaingans. I've heard all the songs from collecting all their singles, and most of them are the kind of songs that after you hear them you'd wish they never cut them from the albums. Amazing"
5,A great compilation of Green Day hits!,"I am not the biggest Green Day fan. After ""Dookie,"" I have been hesitant to buy their albums, due to the number of songs on the album that did not appeal to me. So, I haven't wanted to buy all of the albums so that I could have the songs of theirs that I did like in my collection. Lucky for me, this CD came out and I can enjoy all of the good songs one after the other. I put this in my CD changer in my car and listen to it almost every time I get in to go somewhere. What a great buy!"
2,How to rate an album you've never heard...,"2 stars, EASY,2 stars, because it is Green Day's Music on this pathetic album.Green Day is a great band!This CD is just songs, that aren't really hits, most are great, but some in general are plain. I don't like all of these greatest hits, especially if you own all the albums these ""hits"" are on.This is only good if you aren't expecting what Green Day is. I reccomend Dookie & Nimrod, before anything this!This is not worth the money, I can only see someone buying it if they like the songs and only those songs from each album.Don't buy it, otherwise, I cannot stress that enough!! I bet the money don't even go to this awesome band!"
1,this band is as punk rock as a pink dress-stay away at all costs and hope that this little pop trend will end,"rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
1,Green Day's over.,"What kind of jerks is Green Day? Three lame teens that just play guitars. Their music is lame, and their instruments are lame.Warning was the best song they ever recorded. Now I'm sick of allof them, Dookie is so overrated. People need to stop loving GreenDay and go with all the classic bands insted that are actully great such as Aerosmith, Nirvana, Dire Straits, Metallica, Foreigner, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Who, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Joe Walsh, GNR, and Bruce Springsteen insted.They all are brillant Green Day sucks,GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKSGREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKS GREEN DAY SUCKSThanks and don't buy any Green Day CD as they suck or hide them in the closet or put them in the neighborhood garbage can today."
5,Another great album,I think that this album is the best one yet!(since it is all of their greatest hits and two new songs.)
4,All Their Hits!,"It's what I expected. All their hits, plus a couple more. The additions were a little off the wall of my normal Green Day likes, but all-in-all it's a good CD!"
4,eh not bad,"I'm one of the biggest Green Day fans, i've owned every single and plenty of bootlegs at one point or another. I'm only giving this 4 stars because, although it is a tremendous album, it isn't Green Day's best songs in my opinion. This is for the most part their overplayed hits. All of the 'Dookie' songs I just skip over because i've heard them way too many times, and i hear 'Longview' at least 3 times on the same radio station every day. Songs like ""Maria"", ""Stuck With Me"", ""Nice Guys FInish Last"", ""Redundant"", and ""Macy's Day Parade"" are the best, even though there is no such thing as a bad Green Day song."
5,"Brings back memories, makes new ones.","Their song Good Riddance was my class song, the songs from 1994 were played during my coming of age, and their newest songs were performed live by some friends. I have a close connection to Greenday, and this fun, hit-packed CD is worth the price of admission. There literally isn't a bad song on here, their humor, their wit, and amazingly entertaining music make this the perfect gift for a friend, or for yourself.The two introductory tracks are just as fun as the rest, in case you were worried about the brand new stuff they put on this album."
5,Green Day can not loose!!,"Green Day is my favorite band and forever will be. If they put all of their worst songs on a cd, i would still buy it because to me, there is no such thing as a bad green day song. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW if you only heard a couple of their songs or you want to get to like green day. i recommend this CD even if you have all the songs."
5,A must have. Green Day rocks!,"This album is a must have. It's all of green Day's all time hits, 20 of them. I bought this album and put like 12 of the songs onto my mp3 player. It's awesome. They got some good ones like Hitchin' a Ride, Waiting, Good Riddance, etc. Aww, it's great. Another must have by Green Day"
5,I loved it,"Greenday was honestly one of the first bands I fell in love with that no one introduced me to, I found them out on my own.(when I was in fourth grade mind you) and well when this came out I was thrilled. Its really a great CD to put in and just listen to straight through, no skipping to the REALLY good songs. And I love Poprocks and Coke. Its a great CD for anybody who remembers when these songs first came out, or for anyone wanting an introduction to an influential band from the 90s"
3,Not Really the Greatest Hits,"The real Green Day greatest hits record would have included ""2,000 Light Years Away"", or ""At the Library"" or ""F.O.D."", or ""86"" or...Okay, I could go on for hours, but theres a reason for this. I really love all the Green Day records(except the scattershot ""Nimrod""), and I think they are all the greatest hits record. I know you have to judge the merits of this record by itself, but like the Nirvana greateat hits record, this is unneccassary because the albums are so good.If you are just getting into Green Day, then this is probably a good place to start, even though you can tape all of these songs off the radio. But I would highly recommend you got and get ""dookie"", ""Insomniac"" and ""Warning"" instead of this."
2,arg,"International Superhits you say? It's a bit like calling a britney spears greatest hits something like 'death metals finest hour',alas if only green day were as good as her.Whats that i hear you cry ""but they are the best band ever"".Well sorry you 12 year old with your green day hoodie on but they are most certainly not green day are the lowest commmon denomenator in rock music,playing the lowest form of music(punk)they also don't really do it well and whilst i cannot deny that basket case is a catchy wee song the rest are dull three cord 'anthems' .Also,has nobody noticed that billie joe CANNOT SING,HE JUST SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS GOT A COLD."
3,Green Day - The Best of,"This album will be liked by true Green Day fans and not many more.Each song bears a resemblance to another so there is little variety but certain songs lift the album,such as the classic ""Good Riddance"" and the catchy hits from Dookie and the recent and excellent Warning.No songs appear from the first two albums,Kerplunk is a good investment and the first album features a different drummer.One must be in a particular mood to listen to Green Day,but the album is catchy and uplifting.A worthy investment."
5,A message 4 JAF,I think Green Day really deserved to have a greatest hits cd because there so popular. And here's a lil' message for ya Just Another Fan. WHY THE F**K WOULD YOU GIVE THE F**KING ABLUM 5 STARS IF YOU DON'T F**KING LIKE IT? That makes no sense. Anyway these guys will make it and maybe make another greatest hits cd with some really good tunes so no one will f**king complain about it.
4,Lessons in Love,"Fans of lucid, thought-provoking writing will enjoy Peter Hoeg's offering, Tales of the Night.As in his previous writing, Hoeg's Tales are full of outsiders, people who have learnt that ""it may be necessary to stand on the outside if one is to see things clearly."" Clearly, Hoeg has done some standing on the outside himself, and in Tales of the Night he shares some of what he has learned."
4,I Like It!,"This is the first cordless phone I've ever found comfortable enough to talk on for extended periods. It's ergonomically designed like the old, corded Trimline phones so it doesn't hurt the outside of my ear like most cordless phones do. It's comfortable to hold, and holding it btwn my head and shoulder to free up my hands doesn't cause any of the buttons to key and disconnect - like many cordless phones do. I've had my current one for several years and would keep it except the LCD display on the caller ID has worn out. I'm buying a new one of the same model because I like it so much. I highly recommend this phone!"
1,When did I buy this?,"If this is the phone I bought years ago, then it is junk.I had an off-white version and it maybe lasted for a year.The battery pooped out and when I tried to replace it with a new one, the phone completely died.I don't think it's made anymore but don't buy one if it is."
2,"OK, but very, very limited","I bought three of these from a B&D outlet store. Nowhere on the product packaging does it state that the unit works ONLY with plain old incandescent light bulbs. No low-energy florescent bulbs, no dimmers, no low-voltage halogen lamps, or anything else that uses a transformer or ballast. It also seems to not work if plugged into a surge suppressor. As a result of these limitations, the only lamps in my house that work with the units are night lights."
2,Title Misleading-Not What You Think,"I bought this book thinking it would help me in my new venture of antique collecting. While the authors are very well-qualified in this subject I feel as though it wasn't written for the average person. This book WILL NOT help you when you go to your Saturday garage sale or flea market. The book spends way too much time on furniture and the second half of the book is all 'practice appraisals' which are for objects the average person will never buy or be able to afford. I felt like this book had a certain 'snob' appeal and if you can afford to buy a $5000 or $10,000 piece you probably have enough knowledge without having to consult a book. (I was stumped because the practice appraisals don't list a value for any of this stuff). Save your money and buy a book that directly relates to what you are collecting or hoping to find."
1,Total Waste of Money,"I am sorry, but who ever thought this book was in any way helpful in teaching people to ""Price it Yourself"" was oh so wrong. I was so excited about getting the book and when I opened it to find nothing but page after page of words with only a few drawings to back them up... I was, oh so sadly, disappointed. I guess it might work IF you were to come across the exact item(s) discribed throughout the book. It's like trying to read an encyclopidia, only not as informative. I tried to get through it, but put it down after five or so pages. It's off to the Goodwill, so if you want it, look for it there."
1,No Use To Me,"I have yet to use this book in any real-life, practical way. It is too big to bring to sales and takes too long to research stuff if you did bring it with you. By the time you found the item you were interested in, someone else would have snapped it up. My experience in buying has served me much better. This book has become another shelf-space-eating dust collector."
1,You Can Do Better...,"I bought this book along with another book for baby shower decoration ideas. Boy, was I disappointed. The book is boring and the ideas are not at all original. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one.Now, if you want a really good book with great ideas, try ""Themed Baby Showers: Mother Goose to Noah's Ark"" by Becky Long. It's an excellent book with excellent, original ideas."
2,baby shower book,"I was hoping for more practicle ideas, more inspiration. I got most of my best ideas from family and friends and online. I did not find this very helpful."
2,"better than first, but still crap","Godsmack to me is a boring band. Lyrically; they seem pretty repative. I personnaly get bored easily with lyrics that make the singer the victim. This whole album,as well as their debut is full of ""you've done something to hurt me, and i'm going to get you back"" or at least somthing close to that. ""Sick Of My Life"" is a perfect example just from the title.Also the guitars are extremly boring, I'm a guitar player and a metal head, and it takes more that intense distortion to be hard or heavy. Or GOOD for that matter.I love Sully's voice but that's about it."
5,Riff laden and a full-on metalfest!!,"GODSMACK returns with a blistering CD!! This one sounds like the debut but a bit more restrained...in a good way. The songwriting is stronger, the vocals similar to the first but overall a great 2nd CD!! Highlights are AWAKE, SICK OF LIFE, TRIPPIN' and SPIRAL. Only negative aspect is the stupid VAMPIRES song. An instrumental with dialogue taken from a movie...boring! The only bad thing about this CD. Buy it!!"
3,gets old fast,"When you listen to this album you think it's gonna be good with songs like awake, but afterwards all the songs start sounding the same. You get bored quickly and change to something like metallica whose music isn't all slamming the same note on the guitar for 3 minutes. If you really want to get your money's worth just try and find a single for awake."
5,Probably my favorite album of all-time....,"Godsmack + Awake = Excellent Album.In my opinion, this is one of the best albums ever made. Combining heavy, thick layered chunks of groove-rock and Nu-Metal, and 500some riffs - Awake is truley a AWESOME album. The best tracks are 'Sick of Life' (Truley angry and angst ridden, you can feel the emotion vocalist/guitarist Sully Erna puts out, a great anger vent for thoose bad days), 'Awake' (Real catchy, the lyrics are real great. I love the artistic feel the lyrics are ordered in. Great song, the guitar and bass KICK), and Vampires. I just really like that song, sorry i have formed a musical opinion, but i think this is one of the most underrated songs on the album. This is a great album, a must have for angry metal fans. Really great stuff, go pick it up - its certainly worth your $$$"
5,Great stuff!!,"Godsmack is the best nu metal band out there. I don't get why people call these guys Alice In Chains ripoffs. These guys are much heavier. I suppose some things from the 1st album may hint at a few things AIC, and the closest thing here might be ""Goin' Down"" but even then it really isn't that close.. The guitar riffs are nice and sludgy but the solos could be better. This is a big improvement from the average first album. This is also much heavier. Best songs are the title track, ""Greed"", ""Sick Of Life"" and the spooky, rockin' instrumental ""Vampires"" (great song to play on Halloween, eh?)."
5,GodSmack is the best band on the face of the earth,"I have listened to godsmack sence they came out and, have not stopped sence i think there 2nd was just as good as the frist!Everything about it was great the lyrics, the riffs, bass and drums.i have loved this band and will love this band to then end if there is such a thing for and band like this?(BTW) to all the people who think they know how to judge music peep's like godsmack and others and put them down r nutting but a$$ holes!!!!!!!!!! Unless your can literally get up there and do better and make better riffs solos and play drums as good or better the get up there and do it then email me and i will personly write you and apology but if you cant then dont ever say that they ..."
3,Not as Good ...,"This CD was far from being as good as their first one. The songs tended to blend together so you can't tell when one ended and the next started. There were not any catchy songs as with the first one where you had to play a certain song over and over because it was so good. I am a bit dissapointed since I am a huge Godsmack fan. Well, there is always the next time."
4,GodSmack has returned,"Okay, so it's more of the same. Who cares. If you like your music heavy, crunchy and just straight-forward, Godsmack is the way to go."
5,Love the Smack,"Oh yeah! I'm so glad that Godsmack has finally released their second album. I was skeptical at first, but when I heard it, I knew that is was going to be great. Buy this if you like the other Godsmack cd, Soulfly, Pantera, or Machine Head."
4,A MUST FOR ANY HARD ROCK FAN!!!,"Godsmack's first album was a breath of fresh air for any hard rock lover who grows weary of bubble gum songs performed by individuals who's only talent is that they can carry a tune and shake their pretty little tails. If you like this, that's fine, to each his/her own. Personally, I enjoy letting lose of any aggression I have by listening to this band. It's a perfect outlet for any rage I have built up due to school, work, or crap in general.Awake is a bit different from their first album. To me, it was the type of record I had to listen to three or four times to really get an appreciation for the songs, but on that third or fourth go around I was hooked. Awake, Greed, and Bad Magic are my favorite, but I also like the instrumental song Vampire. Granted, if you do not own a Godsmack CD, stop reading this and go get their first album, but for those that own the first album, and appreciate the band and their music, this is not bad money spent at all."
1,You Fools,"stop wasting your time and money on these awful ""new"" bands. this cd would make a nice jumbo coaster, even at $16. wake up, you sheep. stop doing what everyone else does because you think it makes you cool and get some taste. godsmack sucks."
1,This band was great when they were Alice In Chains!!!!!!!!!!,"I honestly used to like Godsmack but as i got older my music taste matured and I found out how great ""Grunge"" is (the best kind of rock music) I ventured upon Alice In Chains cd ""Dirt"" I was blown away by how good this cd is. Quickly I realized how bad Godsmack rips AIC off. To the point where it makes me sick. I mean I have nothing against being influenced by a band but to copy their sound exactly is stealing is should be a crime. DO NOT BUY THIS CD AND DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BAND!!!!!! The name Godsmack even comes from a AIC chains song called ""God Smack"". It really cant get any worse than this, or can it? It can! I heard Godsmack is now coming out with an aucustic EP. Alice In Chains Had two Aucustic EP's one called ""Sap"" and the other one called ""Jar Of Flies"". Dont buy this cd buy AIC cd ""Dirt"" or ""Facelift"" They are way better than any Godsmack record. Don't support a band with no original sound or talent!"
4,NOT 2 HARD,This C.D. was a pretty good c.d. but i tihnk they could of been just a little bit harder. What i mean is it could of been a little bit more of harder rock. But besides that it was a great c.d.
2,Godsmack - nice tribute to Alice In Chains........,"Of course God smack was the name of an Alice In Chains song of their magnificent 'Dirt' album. The godsmack singer sounds very very much like a blend of James Hetfield (metallica) and Layne staley (Alice in chains). Its pretty obvious that godsmacks influences lie mainly with the two bands mentioned above.The album itself is pretty poor. Nothing altogether originalor interesting. In short, not worth the cash."
4,Godsmack Pt. 2,"Yes, there are many similarities between this album and the album Godsmack...so what!..Godsmack was one of the best albums in recent metal history. These guys are the angry, aggressive, and non teen magazine version Limp Bizkit in that they write songs that make you want to thrash. The lyrics are dark and the music suits is perfectly. This is the album that you want to blast after a bad day as well as an album that makes you want to drive way too fast.I can not reccomend this enough. All the songs are radio ready (you be the judge of whether thats good or not), meaning all have good hooks that are positively infectious, while not compromising the heavy sounds.Buy it."
5,They did it again!,Godsmack did it again. This cd is excellent. It is a great blend of heavy rock and inspiring lyrics. Sully is definitely talented. If you are into hard rock this is one for your collection.
5,What is this album missing hmmmm? SHANNON LARKIN!,"I think the only thing that could have made this album 6 stars is Shannon Larkin. I actually think this album is much better than their first, oh who am I kidding out of all 5 (the other side an LP, also good but I am waiting for a Percussively solid lineup with Sully and Shannon) of their studio releases this is it. Don't get me wrong, the first is good... But I think Awake closes a chapter and Faceless opened up their modern sound... and IV is eh, well... trying to be diverse. I recommend this album of them all."
1,A Tough Decision,"So...I am a member of this CD club, and I was trying to maximize the number of free CDs I could receive from the club. Well, they told me if I ordered my feature selection, Godsmack - Awake, I could pick two additional free CDs (I chose Faith No More - Angel Dust and Dilated Peoples - The Platform). On the other hand, I could have just purchased another CD to fulfill my membership agreement, but I wouldn't get the additional 2 free CDs. So I decided to order the featured selection and am enjoying my free selections! Why do I tell you this? Just to show you how devoid of emotion, feeling, and talent this godsmack album is. Its worth more as a bartering chip than an actual musical selection. If you like classic rock, you won't like this. If you like hardcore/death/thrash, you won't like this. If you are in the middle of the road and like your hard rock/metal with some melody, there is so so much more out there that is worth your while."
1,Give these guys some GNR!!!!,"ahhhh yet another Godsmack album, so what does that mean? More tired rock cliches, more riffs that never sail and more of Sully Erna's melancholic rock jock persona. Erna's still growling about pain and suffering and blah blah blah! He sings ""sick of my life"" and ""all i feel is hate"" with about as much feeling as a drunk Britney Spears. Not only that but all the usual cliches are there, rat-tat-tat guitar riffs turn into boring choruses, guitar solos come alive about as often as Gary Coleman's (...) life and the occasional groove is thwarted by Erna's processed lyrics. For an album called awake it sure is a great sleep inducer."
2,not as good as first,I didn't really like this album as much as I did their first one. The songs aren't as good and they're aren't as many. I mean what are there like 11 tracks? I got this CD and was quite disappointed. If you wanna check out Godsmack get their first album instead.
4,The new Godsmack,"The new Godsmack album is, well, amazing. They've perfected their particular style of hard rock (I've heard it's an Alice in chains rip, but does that matter? Influences can run strong, ask Manson...), but in the process they lost the dynamics that made the first album so spectacular. Whereas this album has no ""Whatever"" or ""Time Bomb"" to help, it doesn't suffer from decaying near the end like the first. This album carries its own beautiful, never failing to display the newly perfected Godsmack. Showing a refreshing riffing style for their genre and a natural affinity to more exotic sounds (The Journey/Spiral is to this album what Voodoo was to the last)the cd continues perfectly where the self-titled left off, in the midst of enough musical anger and despair to make Reznor worry about his throne of angst."
2,SOPHMORE SLUMP,"I've always loved Godsmack since their debut a few years ago. Godsmack was awesome, all their songs were listenable. Then I bought Awake. It wasn't very good. Some songs, like Awake and Sick Of Life were good, but the rest stunk. It was hardcore but not very good. I'd buy Godsmack instead, then put Awake and Sick Of Life on mixes, and wait for the third Godsmack album to come around."
5,Good,What's up with all the negative reviews? I like this band. This album kicks ass! Here's the song rating:1. Sick of Life 5/52. Awake 5/53. Greed 5/54. Bad Magick 4/55. Goin' Down 5/56. Mistakes 5/57. Trippin' 4/58. Forgive Me 5/59. Vampires 5/510. Journey N/A11. Spiral 5/5Bottom line: It's a very good album!I'm done here.
2,Stick a broomstick in Godsmack,The best thing these guys could do would be to conjure up a spell that sends Linkin Park back to nursery school. Popular heavy metal is so LAME!
1,Who needs help playing the same chord over and over? Anyone?,"This CD is a disgrace to all metal. We have a singer with the same messege in every song (""Go away! Stay away!""), a guitarist who plays the same power chord over and over, and a crappy drummer. The only slight props I can give is to the bassist. This CD is terrible, don't get it.Favorite songs: Sick of Life"
4,To : David Nash,T-h-e-r-e - a place T-h-e-i-r - possessive T-h-e-y'r-e - stands for They areAs for Godsmack - their (t-h-e-i-r) latest video ROCKS - great CD as well
5,This album rocks!!!!!!!,"This album is awesome. Sully's vocals are a lot stronger than before. The guitars and drums sound heavier than before. I liked how the CD came with an enhanced portion which had a little menu that had the songs and when you click on them it gives the lyrics, picture, and a video clip of them talking about the album. Each song has its own clip. I just wish that it would have included the music video ""Awake"" in the enhanced portion, but the CD is still cool though."
4,Hard rocking CRUNCH,"Good 2nd effort from the Boston 4-some... as hard and crunchy as it may be..... I like it a ton..... but, it sounds like it is more of the same (as their 1st self titled disc from 1998). Same in-yer-face attitude, hard guitars chords, lyrics chock full of sorrow, pain and anger - what is new here? Don't get me wrong - I like this disc. There debut was so strong and it broke new ground... along the likes of Creed (a strong first album, followed up by more of the same on their 2nd)... where is the creativity.... or something just a little bit different.... to leave a slightly different taste in your mouth. If you like the 1st Godsmack - and are looking for more of the same - you will absolutely DIG this disc. Buy the disc, hit yourself with a 2x4, and enjoy. Best songs... Sick of Life, Vampires, Forgive Me, and Black Magick."
2,This shouldn't keep you Awake too long...,"Let's face it, I'll state right from the start that Godsmack's debut album was better. Awake, their second go, is on a whole just much less interesting than their original. Awake is great, as are Sick of Life, Greed, and Bad Magick. However, after Bad Magick, the CD goes way downhill. It can't hold my interest after it gets past the aforementioned 4th track. Any album that has 4 decent tracks followed by 7 junk tracks doesn't deserve anything more than the rating I gave it."
2,This is alright,God smack is okay. It should be more realistic. Their song awake is the one that I didn'tlike. The guitar was good but the vocal was horrible. If you want metal listen to Mettalica. Its alot better then this.
2,Funny...,"Granted, everyone that's not Sully in the band has a dash of talent, but they don't exactly have a knack for diverse song writing. I remember when I first heard it; I'd borrowed it from my friend and kicked back at home, putting it on. I remember soon thinking ""damn, this is a long song"", only to look over at my player and see it on track 4. Save two songs, this album is set to the same beat and the same guitar part, with the same vocal pattern. Their first album was basically a compilation of their favorite songs redone with a twist to call their own (most prominent on ""Timebomb"", if you own NIN's Broken EP), and now that they have their own sound, they can't seem to get out of it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good album to listen to if you want background metal to listen to, but nothing noteworthy."
3,Good...but could have been better,"While I like the CD, I must say I was dissapointed. Godsmack's first CD was one of the best I have heard, and it still gets played in my CD player regularly. Awake, however, rarely gets my attention anymore. The songs all sound the same, and there isn't as much emotion in the songs as there was in their self-titled release. I guess I expected more out of the album than it actually delivers. Something tells me they released this CD just to get another album out. I have to recommend this CD though, cause after hearing I Stand Alone off The Scorpion King soundtrack, I have the feeling their next release is going to blow everything else they released out of the water, so complete your collection now before this album becomes hard to find."
2,More effort please.,"I hate to write this review, but this needs to be said, this CD shows a serious lack of effort. I loved their first release, it's one of my favorite CD's of all time, but it seems like they didn't even try on this new album. They didn't even TRY to do anything new with the lyrics, the songs all sound the same (Sick of Life and Greed demonstrate this all to well), and am I the only one who thinks they are ripping off Sevendust with all the low end guitar and bass? Godsmack seemed one of the most innovative bands in terms of musical talent, but now I can only hope that they will try harder on the next CD."
4,AIC rip offs?,"I'd like to know how a band goes about imitating another band even though they don't sound alike and have different types of songs. In my opinion godsmack and alice in chains sound nothing alike. True, godsmack is an AIC song title and true, they used a similar sun logo but it's all about the music here. Godsmack makes good music as did aic and believe me i am a huge fan of alice in chains and i can't wait for them to tour with william duvall. But, come on, these bands are totally different from each other. as for this album, probably their weakest effort but still quite good."
4,Big Time Tease,"I was expecting such big things from this CD based off this groups stellar debut and hearing the first single, ""Awake"". When I bought the CD and heard the first three songs I was even happier with it and then the rest of the album hit. Luckily, the group sitcks with what they know and still do it well but for some reason the album comes off as being uneven with some of the songs sounding uninspired and lazy. Excellent lead off on the CD, but then its kind of a frustrating battle trying to skip to the good stuff on the rest of it."
4,Heavy,"Wow, these guys have some really heavy guitars. I'm not sure I've heard heavier riffs anywhere, and I listen to a lot of heavy music. The only band that might have heavier riffs is Nevermore. There's not much to say about this album, all the songs more or less sound the same, and the solos aren't very good, but man, they've got some monstrous riffs! I can play just about every song on here, but I can't get it to sound as heavy, this guy must use a 50 foot amp or something. There's lots of better music out there than this, but if you just want something heavy, this album has you covered. It's a lot better than the debut also, I only liked a couple of songs off of it. You would be better off buying Alice in Chains, but if you already have all their stuff, this is worth a listen."
4,YYYYYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!,"This CD is everything a good follow up album should be. Godsmack's first offering is one of the best CD's of all time, and ""Awake"" is almost as good. The only problem I had with this disk is that it is too short. The 11 songs (10 really) are over with in less than 50 minutes, but the time is used well. From the first yell on ""Sick of Life"" to the last piano key on ""The Spiral"", this album rocks!"
5,"First, you must like hard rock...","If the above is true, THEN BUY THIS CD! I'm not talking about crappy 80's hard rock, this is quality stuff. Though the lead singer is a drumer, he still does a good job, and because of him, their songs sound much better than the random noise you hear from most heavy metal bands. In this cd, the songs have become much more raw, and they have experamented a little, like in my favorite track, Vampires. Again, this is a must have."
5,Awake too the future,Godsmack sounds like some new religon that some little satanist made up in there garage.Godsmack brings you the simple lyrics of metalicca with the hard sound of Korn! Ever since the first album Godsmack has stayed true to its first cd. Which lately has not happend i.e. Stained and Limp bizket. They stayed true to what there fans not the media craz was at the time of relise. Sully IS a Dark Lord.
3,Better than the debut,"I wasn't all crazy about Godsmack's first album (I thought the songs sounded too much the same, I hated the lyrics, and it ripped off Alice In Chains), but the songs on Awake really convinced me. (It's more like a 3 1/2 star over a three). Each song smoothly has its uniquety and I can definitely tell these people have matured from being so stupid. Each songs got guitar riffs that feel like a whole ride of something Manson hasn't done in the Goth music (he sucks. He is only famous because he's a wannabe-Antichrist who ripped off Jesus CHrist Superstar), and out of such rap-rock that needs to go away or I'll go insane. Most of these songs are of great quality, however, some songs have parts that sound exactally like something AIC would make. BUt it's getting better as time goes by. SO, if you ARE a fan maybe you wanna pick THIS up."
3,Not Bad,"This album is more consistant than the debut but it doesn't have any one great song except maybe Awake, spiral, or vampires. On the debut there was a lot of really good songs like Moon Baby and Whatever, even though a lot of the songs on the cd sucked. But if you are a fan of the song Awake, than you won't be too dissapointed with this one."
1,A Dispointment.,"First off, I wasn't a big Godsmack fan from before, so this album was the first one I have listened to all the way through. Now, I LOVE the song Awake. I couldn't get enough of that song on the radio, so I bought the cd. Well, by far that is the best song on the cd and the rest just kind of either fall short, or fall off altogether.I think that if you're a Godsmack fan, then you'll probably love this album. But if you've only heard Awake and think it's pretty cool, then you'd be best to steer clear of this cd."
3,"Not bad...not that good, though, either","Awake begins with three absolutely blisteringly hard rock, the type we don't hear often enough any more. Godsmack's metal sound has a definite modern edge to it, but you won't find a smidgen of rap influences here, making them unique in today's hard rock scene.The three excellent tracks mentioned above are ""Sick of Life,"" the title track, and ""Greed."" If the rest of the album was able to jump the bar set by these three songs, we'd be in good shape. However, things go downhill from here. The track ""Vampires"" is an instrumental one with news-y sound bites in the background and is kind of cool. Other than that, the album sounds much like Godsmack's first (which I wasn't wild about.)Those three songs, though...check those out, at least."
4,Good body wash,Got this based on the reviews on here. Refreshing smell and is a big bottle. It will last you a long time. Plus the commercials are cool.
2,dye in product stains,I purchased Old Spice Body Wash for my husband. While he loves the product the green dye in it is ruining my wash cloths and it also stained the bottom edge of my shower curtain! That dye they use in it is terrible. It stains every fabric it touches and I can not get it out.I have soaked the items in Oxy Clean and in bleach and still that dye remains in the wash cloths. It makes everything look like it is dirty no matter how many times I wash. What bothers me the most is that these items that are destroyed are less than 2 months old. I replaced my old items recently and now the new ones look worse than the old ones.While the product itself works and smells great be sure you are not using a wash cloth that will matter to you when applying it. Either that or use a bath puff. It seems to come out of synthetics since the shower curtain is ok now but the cotton wash cloths are never going to be the same again. I am buying some black ones!
2,Not my idea of a good book,"As imprecise and different as many versions of Greek Mythology are, I would not recommend this book. When I bought it, eager to read and trace back the mythological families, I was rather disappointed. Of course, there are many different versions of each stories, but some of these ""differences"" are rather inaccurate. (ex: Here is a quote from the book ""Hippolytus was appalled by her passion, he preffered to hunt at night with the virgin goddess Artemis) Now, I know the myths have many versions, but Hippolytus was a priest, according to Euripides, play, Hippolytus. Besides, Artemis' hunting companions were mainly nymphs, anyway. There were many ""differences"" such as this in the book. I would not recommend it."
1,A little disappointed,"I was hoping for something a little more authentic. The drums on this CD almost sound as if they were recreated by a keyboard. Doesn't really have that steel pan sound. But if you want good background music for a caribbean themed party, this would work quite well."
3,A little disappointing,"Good couple of CD's overall but about 6 of the tracks were obviously recorded from older recordings. They sound as if they were recorded from a vinyl record, they have static and pops in them. The rest of the tracks are clear and sound good but I would have to say I would spend my money on another steel drums CD if given the chance to do it again."
5,No disappointment at all,"I think it is the best of steel drum CD products available on market.Of course there are some compositions which are too noisy, but such compositions like Carnival, Sounds of the Sun, Rhythm, Island Home, etc., overweight this. They are very funny and listning them some can solve their depressed mood. Recommendations."
3,Had purchased for a Luau wedding reception,"I purchased this item to keep with the theme of wedding reception. I love tropcial/island music. However I must admit that this disc is an okay item. The word that comes to mind is elevator music, and you can only handle so much at one time. I will still probably use this/along with others at the reception simply as light background music."
3,Helter Skelter - Media Myth and the Cult of Spin,"I give this high marks as far as a time line of events and telling the truth about the bungling of the investgation. But Bugliosi over sold the race war as a way to establish motive and used straights vs. counter culture paranoia as a way to get a quick conviction.Race wars i.e. the protest and riots had been going on for several years so the idea that a few murders would put whites and blacks more at each other was very slim at best. Second writing off Mason and family as ""drug crazed"" is silly, lots of people took (take) drugs and very few turn into multiple killers.Read Susan Atkins - The Myth of `Helter Skelter' at susanatkins (dot) org for some counter spin to the Bugiosi version. It shows Manson to be more of a basic drug dealer than a cult leader and the family as a group of trusting, somewhat stupid, 15-25 year old people that got caught in a vortex of events."
1,"Slow, too easy, too boring","This video is painfully boring and would not challenge even the newest beginner to exercise. To much boring blather between each series of exercises. Explains at length very simple moves yet demonstrates poor (some time dangerous) form and bad habits. If you are looking for a quick and efficient workout - or worse, a challenging one - run, don't walk, away from this one. I wish I could get my money back!"
2,WAY too complicated,"I'm a firefighter and I wanted to get in better shape. I bought this book as well as the workbook. I thought it would be easy to follow because this guy's a firefighter....the workout is designed for firefighters.....how complicated could it be? Trying to follow along with the ""phases"" and stuff is like trying to teach a monkey calculus. Too many variables & footnotes to be able to follow along for those of us who are gym novices.So....I'd suggest if you/re not a seasoned gym-rat....to pass on this book."
3,firefighter workout,This was in good condition and arrived on time. It is a classic format for workout books but specifically focuses on the types of strengths needed for firefighting.
1,Can't See its Offspring,"I recently purchased the AT&T 436 and it displays call made from land lines as it should. But calls made from AT&T wireless phones don't register, instead it displays ""error present"" or ""line error"". Strange, my other caller ID devices, including an AT&T wall phone, Bell South caller ID box and a Panasonic wireless phone all display both cell and land line numbers. What's even more interesting is this AT&T caller ID box is specifically rejecting calls from it's own AT&T family. Go figure! I returned it for a full refund."
1,Piece of Junk,"This is supposed to display the caller information, and store up to 100 calls in memory. The display of the current call works, but after getting several calls in memory the characters change to display complete gibberish when looking back at the history. If you have a use for the call history, don't buy it because it doesn't work."
1,Awful,"I had this for not even a month, and then it just totally stopped working. I couldn't get it to turn on.And, when it was workinga) it was really hard to see the numbers on the screen andb) the voicemail light would often blink even when there was no message and no new phone call.Total waste of money."
1,The Caller ID/Call Waiting Feature Does Not Work,I am on my second unit and the caller ID/call waiting feature doesn't work.
1,Short circuit!,The AT&T 436 had a short-circuit after 3 months of use. It brought our phone line to its knees. It took a Verizon technician an hour to trace our phone trouble to one little caller-ID box gone bad. Our phone line was out for two days.
1,Never could quite get it to work.,"I wish I had saved all the packing stuff for this piece of junk. It seemed to work, for a while. After a time, it just punked out, and I just threw it away. Since then, I have replaced all my phones with ones that display caller id, and I am (reasonably) happy with them.You'd think an old name like AT&T; would think before they put their logo on junk like this. Time was, everything from the phone company (remember? THE phone company) was made to last."
1,Thorougly confused,After reading the previous 8 reviews I am beginning to understand why I am experiencing problems. These reviews have helped me to become aware of many features available or needed to make this type of unit a more user friendly device.The information re; being incompatible with DSL is true in my case also. I have requested support from atttelephoneproducts@aatphones.com.
5,A Bootstrapper's Must Read!,"Practical, trustworthy, real, encouraging are a few of the words that come to my mind after reading this nifty eBook. You will get a lot out of this. Stanford MBA in 65 pages: business models, math and madness. I am the CEO of Spillover.com and I say buy it, and apply it - we are!"
4,Fun games for Arkansas fans,The quality of the broadcast is pretty good. The first half is boring but the second half has some exciting plays. This is NOT the national championship game. The package doesn't say that it is but the Amazon subtitle does.
3,Not quite a replacement for older 9V model,"I was about to return this sleeve until I learned from Tetra that they no longer have the older model available...thus I decided that rather than replacing the entire UV clarifier, I would try to adapt this ""new"" sleeve.Using my dremel tool, I ground down the 3 protruding tabs on the inside of the plastic mold on the sleeve. Making them absolutely flush to the inside of the plastic was necessary in order to insert and twist down the top.Worked fine...good luck!"
5,On time and Correct Fit,"Amazon's amazingly wide array of koi pond accessories provided me with the correct parts to fit a broken UV Filter for my pond. Without the ability to find such items, replacement of the filter would have cost me $200+. As it is I repaired the filter for less the $40."
1,One Great song.,This album has one fantistic song. The rest sounds as though they were written and sung in the late 1950's
2,Looks great but not really.......,I bought of of these a couple of years ago. It had a string buzz i could not get rid of. I tried adjustments & nothing worked. The stand it's on doesn't hold the bass firmly it kept slipping out of position. i returned it & ended up up getting a refund.
2,No caller ID,"We bought this as an additional office phone. As far as call quality goes, it is good. The phone has has no caller ID, and we just didn't like the phone because of that. We ended up going to office Depot and buying a different phone because of the caller ID. We need it in our business, so if you can live without it, you'd probably like the phone."
5,Absolutly Awesome,Lisa is such a realistic book. i feel in love with it. i read only a couple of the SpringSong books and i want to read all of them. I am a girl in 6th grade and it really teaches young girls my age what can happen to women at young ages if their not carefull (just like my mom says!!)This is one of my favorite books and had a sad ending.It even made me cry.
3,Don't go totally soft on us fans you guys!,"I became a huge Placebo fan after the release of Black Market Blood. Own all 3 past recordings and have eagarly awaited thier lastest release. Maybe I was just too psyched, but after hearing ""The Bitter End"" a month before the album release, I totally expected ""Sleeping with Ghosts"" to be an all out classic Placebo record. I was somewhat dissapointed. The boys seem to have mellowed out a bit. There are some great songs like The Bitter End, This Picture, Special Needs, Plasticine and Second Sight, that could be put alongside with their past classic songs. The other songs do grow on you but for me will probally not hold up with time. Overall the guys put out an ok record."
3,these are sad and painful songs....i pity them,"The good songs are The Bitter End, Plasticine, and This Picture.Threatening, malevolent, depressing, cacophonous, and sad. They've succeeded in what they set out to do. Call me a bubble-gum pop pilgrim, but Placebo are more horrible than the Velvet Underground, since heroin was a vehicle of pleasure. These guys write songs so honestly morbid, without the comic backdrop of Shock Rock or Death Metal, that it is ultimately really depressing. This is music like a Francis Bacon or Lucian Freud in their ""flesh is rotting meat"" periods, a florescent lit autopsy of sonic deconstruction that reduces the fun parts of rock to steel. More artful and pop-tune driven than The Swanns, but just as depressing."
4,Good music but not their best.,"This album is hard for me to review. Most of the songs are good but I don't think they are up to the usual Placebo standards. FYI, my fav album of theirs is Black Market Music so you know where I'm coming from. I saw them in concert a few weeks ago and it was great. When they played songs from this CD, they didn't seem out of place or anything, but they just weren't as good as other material. If I was you, I would ""acquire"" at least 3 random tracks from the CD and see what you think. Try to avoid the singles. Who knows? You may like the new direction Placebo is going in..."
3,Not the Placebo I had hoped for,"Sorry to say it, but this album is a bit of a let down. I've listened to it a couple times now, and already wonder if I want to keep it.Black Market Music, the previous album, is this band's highpoint.On this new one - as much as the vocals are a distinct aspect of Placebo - in most cases they're just annoying, too loud over the music. They're one of my favorite bands, but I guess it's gotten old to hear words like ""black"" sung ""blaa-Hack"" or ""scar"" sung ""scar-Harr."" I think the production is great, there are some great songs. I think it's just hard to top Black Market Music. When I think of Placebo I want music for the end of the world, emotive, beautiful, loud guitars, something that would scare adults. I don't think the new one totally does this."
2,The Drugs Don't Work...,"If you know the feeling of coming down from agood night of the drink and getting high, thenyou'll know the feeling of listening to thisrecord - a sobering letdown. Their weakesteffort yet, Placebo lazily falls back onelectronica because Molko's got nothing leftto say. Best tracks: This Picture, SpecialNeeds. More filler than on three previousefforts. Sadly, Placebo is no longer anessential band...- cRAIG"
2,Sounds like he wrote it in a month,"After Without You I'm Nothing and Black Market Music I was really looking forward to Sleeping With Ghosts. Unfortunately I was very dissappointed with Placebo's latest. The lyrics are incredibly repetitive, it feels rushed. There was definitely a lack of creativity on this album...hopefully the next is better..."
3,they are dragging around a corpse,"Placebo was my favorite all time band only three years ago! I adored everything about them: how beautiful Brian Molko was, his voice, the clever yet catchy lyrics, and just the entire beautiful sound.This CD feels like they are trying to return to the beauty of ""Without You I'm Nothing"". The songs have a similar feel to them, but something is missing. Originality? Beautiful lyrics? Yep. Mr. Molko sounds bored with his own songs half of the time! All of the lyrics on this CD are extremely repetitive and sound cliche, like he recycled parts of lyrics from all the old songs from ""Without You I'm Nothing"" and made them horribly boring.Now, that being said, it's still a good CD on its own, but compared to ""Without You I'm Nothing"" and their debut album ""Placebo"", which are both excellent, it is a failure. There are still some good songs on it like ""This Picture"", ""The Bitter End"", and ""Protect me from What I Want"". It's good, but it isn't amazing."
2,SLEEPING is an understatement,"Sleeping is exactly what the album makes me feel like. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the previous three albums - but I found this latest offering to be quite boring.My fav songs (and the only ones I really like from the album) are This Picture, The Bitter End, and Special Needs.Also, the audio quality sounds absolutely horrible - VERY muffled and muddy sounding. With better quality I would have added another star."
5,Everything you need.,"As with other reviews i've done, i'll start out saying that Placebo is my favorate band ever. And that this album came out during the height of my obsession with their music. At the time, life was in turmoil, so their previous album(Black Market Music) and this one quickly became my personal soundtrack to losing hope. I still can't listen to this album without getting some sort of intense flashback.The album isn't without its perky points, such as the opening blast of Bulletproof Cupid, or This Picture. However a great deal of the album drives itself into that dark romantic feel that made bands like the Cure and Depeche great. In the USA, its always amazing how the band never became larger then they are, as I find them a very easy hook for friends looking for a new group.Although if you plan to buy this album, I would recommend looking for the special edition with the covers disc included. Its almost a full album in itself and very much worth the extra price."
4,Great book,My grandson is 3 1/2 years old. He just can't put the book down!! The pictures are fascinating to him. Very mysterious and intriguing. I recommend the book to anyone who wants to have a child become interested in reading.
1,Bad experience,"When I bought it the 2nd (RE) string was too short to be used, so I had to reuse the old rusty one I had just discarded. I don't know if it was a problem with my individual set, or if it is a common problem with Avarez strings... so, beware."
2,could be more concise,Was rather of a long story and sometimes hard to read as it doesn't get to the point quick. But I did get one good idea from it so there was some value in it for me.
4,Theory of Constraints Summary,"Viable Vision is a strategic summary of Dr. Eli Goldratt's Theory of Constraints. Gerald Kendall covers the application of constraint management principles across the entire organization with the single objective to turn Sales Revenue figures into Net Profit within 4 years.The author proposes to find the leverage points in Manufacturing, Finance, Marketing, Supply Chain, Sales, Project Management, Engineering and IT with the common objective of increasing the efficiency of the profit generation process."
2,"""All of the factors that go into a yes/no question""","This book reads more like a novel than a true-to-reality story. Darrach seems only interested in the ugliness of the characters & does so quiet creatively. I'm sure he has a lot of people mad at him right now. With all the books about Fischer I guess he was trying to do something different. Three fourths of the book is about whether or not Bobby is going to take the plane to Iceland for a game that the entire world is anticipating, a kind of way to keep the reader in suspense. Only the end got into the tension and psychological madness that these games can become, which I really liked. I have to admit that I skimmed over the rest because it all boiled down to whether Bobby was going to play or not, and a simple yes or no would have allowed him to fit more interesting details like his relationship to girls and the odd things that geniuses can do with their brains."
1,Say NO to Sloan,"I will never buy anything with the name ""Sam Sloan"" on it.Hopefully this book will sell zero copies and in the future anyone who thinks that asking Sam Sloan to write a forward for their book or to contribute in any other way will be discouraged."
5,Adorable Celebration,"When I was invited to read a book about Chinese New Year to young readers at school(K & PreK), this book was my personal pick. Adorable story and illustrations about a family of three generations celebrating Chinese New Year, MY FIRST CHINESE NEW YEAR contains all essential festive elements of this important holiday. From cleaning the house to make way for good fortune, getting new haircuts and clothes, cooking the big banquet for family reunion, getting that lucky red envelopes and finally going out with everyone to watch the dragon and lion dance on the street, this book has it all and will surely delight a classroom full of curious minds. Spice it up with paper lion puppet and red envelopes with candies inside for the class and you are surely in the spirit of Chinese New Year celebration!"
1,Nothing special and there is a critical mistake.,"Go to search the content of the book. Use the word 'finally' to get to page 22, ""Finally at the of the parade..."" Didn't anyone at the publisher's examine the book before putting it on sale? This is downright criminal. What are children as young as 4 supposed to do when they get to this line?I hate the plog at amazon. I wish there is a way to turn it off all together. I also hate authors who waste time writing them. In this case Ms Katz should take the time to read this review and try and come up with a response. Please put educating our young before your greed. I put it less than 50% chance that this review will NOT be removed.There are better and more beautify Chinese New Year books around."
1,Not a perfect fit,"I bought this for a 99 Prizm, and while I did get it to work, I expected much more.There is a lot of trimming and cutting to make it fit.The major downside is that the factory cup holder will not fit in the mount. The width is too small. So I have an open slot in the dash."
3,Not sure you'll need this,"I bought this. It is well made, but I didn't need it. Have a 2000 Toyota Corolla. The brackets on the existing radio fit onto the new Pioneer radio/CD. So I didn't need this. Not really sure how it would have fit anyways. Did not seem to have the right angles on the bracket. Might have worked, so ... that's all. Good luck."
4,"Cool Phone, Cool Colors","I really like this phone. It comes in a fun color, and has all of the special things people want. Like having 4 different ringer sounds, or the 3 seperate volume settings. I also loved having the page/ringer that rings until u find the phone, for those pesky times when you just have to make a call. And who wouldn't like a wall-mountable phone, for when you have no room for a phone. Loved the phone, and I hope you do too."
1,Go elsewhere,"This is indeed a rare classic and if you must have it, I guess you can pay an average of 100 dollars for a used or new one. But I went a different route. You can download the same album from HDtracks.com in high rez format of 48 khz/24 bit. If your so inclined you can then burn to DVD-Audio disc and play it that way. Total cost then around 20 bucks new and you'll always have the file (assuming you back it up)."
2,Here we go again!!!!!!!!!,"With all due respect to Richard Carpenter, this collection is a disappointment. I have a very high end audio system. If he was going to remix these songs, why not get rid of all of the excess and artificial sounding reverb and clean up the vocal tracks? Why not try to create an intimate in your room sound instead of the same old, tired, re-packaged sound. The SACD track only helps alittle. The vocals still sound edgy and grainy to me and since the original tracks were analog, this was in the mix or the mastering. Next time, go for a cleaner, more intimate sound, not the same stuff we've already heard countless times."
5,Simply incredible,"To be honest, I never was a big fan of the Carpenters music. However I have always loved Karen Carpenters voice. I believe she was one of the best ever singers, bar none.This disc release has brought new life to some older recordings. Richard Carpenter spent a lot of time getting this perfected in honor of the continuing memory of his sister, and the results are astounding. Karen Carpenters voice sounds like it is in the room. Pretty good for 30- 40 year old recordings. There are 23 of some of the most memorable Carpenter hits, and a few that I personally dont remember, but they all have had a lot of restoration done. It is an amazing sounding disc"
4,a must have,Karen Carpenter is without a doubt the greatest female singer I've ever heard. TheSACD brings her voice such beautiful justice. I would like to hear the mix with more of her and less of every other sound. Sometimes I find the orchestra too close to her voice. I could listen to her all night without ANY other musical support!
5,Simple and honest: You Can Feel The Love,"Before I got this movie, I was thinking that it would most likely be like all the other movies with the same theme. But then the fact that the treatment may be different made me go ahead and see it for myself. After all, Sid Lucero has had a very good track of tasteful movies. When I got the movie, I saw what I always wanted in any performance: the artists don't show me how they feel, but they make me feel how they feel. You can feel their desire, they're eagerness, their anxiety, their yearning, and their love. Also, this movie joins the ranks of movies that present love or sex scenes in a most natural and honest, and non-typical way. Such high taste! I very highly recommend this movie because I consider it of its very high artistic merit and very least commercialism."
3,Confusing Ravenloft concept,"This book was very confusing in where it was set. I was never really sure that it took place in Ravenloft at all. It could just as easily have been set in any fantasy setting. To me this is what caused it to lose much of its appeal.I bought this book for the sole purpose of seeing how a paladin would function in Ravenloft, how the mists would react to his presence, how the Lords would deal with him. None of this is ever covered. In fact, the main character never becomes a paladin.The story was mildly interesting and the authors did have some nice plot twists, but this did not read as a Ravenloft novel.If you're looking for a good story this worth a try. If you're looking for a good Ravenloft book, look elsewhere."
3,Started out slow but it does satisfy,"This book started really slow. The only reason i kept reading was because i love paladins. My handle all over the net is usually paladin or paladore so i kept reading on. The only really bad guys in it were ghouls which i never thought to be that tough in rpgs but in this they are deadly and of course Ebonbane. There could have been a few more enemies. From the middle of the book till the end, were really really good and satisfying so if i could i would give it a 3.5 but a 3 is all i'm allowed to give."
3,Started strong but could have finished better,"Shadowborn started extremly strong, that it had become almost impossible to put down. As the final battle between good and evil drew to its conclusion it seemed that it was just put together to really just end the book. This was one story that if you would love to see a paladin in the Ravenloft setting, it is one that should be read."
3,a much needed paladin,"the book hooked me right from the first page. the charcters were very interesting and the situation was intriging. unfortunatly the book loses it's momentum towards the end, breaking down into alot of combat, the story seemed to be lost in one battle after another. but having said that i still enjoyed reading it and it gives some interesting ideas. if you are a fan of the ravenloft series then give this one a read."
1,Not what I expected,The stretching she does is not what I expected. Don't like all the breathing techniques. Wish I could return it and wish you could view a little of the dvd to see if that was what you wanted. Very disappointed
2,not value for money,"only 10 min plus a review of the same exercisepost exercise feels good, would have enjoyed a 30 min gentle workout"
1,Not good,"This video is more like ballet moves instead of stretching. I returned it as it was not what I was looking for. It may be good for others though, just not for me."
1,Again-still hasnt arrived yet!!!,Cannot give an honest review of the content of the dvd as im still awaiting its arrival.Was orderd six weeks ago.This is unaceptable.
3,a nice anime to watch :),"a nice anime of 12 episodes that are worth of watching.The reason i gave it 3 stars not becuase it`s bad or anything just becuase the idea or the story of the anime is not new that`s all.Well,this is my openion,so buy it and see for yourself you might like it because i did."
1,wrong item,The item is fine. It was the wrong DC adaptor for the Garmin unit purchased. It was listed along the Garmin unit as the correct one for the unit. It was for another Garmin line of products. I'm sure it worked well on the correct product.
4,This is nice,This is a handy product to have with your GPS. It allows you to recharge in your car or on your ATV.
2,"Unfair, Unbalanced, and Unqualified...","Tom McGill's ""engineering"" background is about as relevant to interpreting the population status of a marine mammal as an auto mechanic's background is for performing open heart surgery. I gave this book ""2 stars"" because at least I now have a better understanding of why engineers should stick to engineering, and science should be left to scientists."
1,junk journalism,"Note to Joe T: Are you reviewing this book or are you just reviewing the previous reviewer (which is a violation of Amazon's policy)? If anyone ""doth protest too much"", I think it's Joe T. All reviewers are entitled to their opinion. The book itself is shock journalism at its worst, and only serves to irritate an already divisive issue in Florida. The posted reviews are a clear indication of that."
2,"Fun, but don't take it seriously","I would have to agree with the reviewer from Tampa. This book is unintentionally funny, but can't be taken seriously. The author suggests an X-Files type conspiracy that is pretty far fetched. It sounds like he's simply a disgruntled boater that wants to go fast, regardless of who or what he runs over. Having said that, I'm sure this book will be a favorite among redneck boaters and good-old-boy Florida politicians opposed to any sort of environmental conservation."
5,The Environmentalist are controlling our waterways,"Capt Tom McGill's book explains in detail how boaters in the state of Florida have lost their boating rights because of the powerful special interest group $MC and state agencies such as BPSM and FMRI efforts to create a crisis where no crisis exist. Mr. McGill's insight and analysis of the states data, data that's been ignored by the states law makers, has caused undue regulations on boaters and has not protected one Manatee. This leaves one to conclude that because the science and facts do not support your agenda it must be ignored. This book has exposed the true problem for the Manatee its called Special Interest and Government Intervention. This book is a must read !!!"
1,save your money....,"I picked up this book for 2 dollars at a local flea market. I was disappointed that I didn't purchase a funnel cake instead. The author probably thinks that hurricanes are also a government conspiracy to eliminate boating in Florida. The ""use of the state's data"" in this book is shaky at best. If you're looking for non-fiction, save your money on something more non-biased."
4,"Venom, yes - Data, absolutely","Tom McGill's points are delivered with plenty of venom, which makes the book entertaining (not unlike the venom in the Tampa reviewer's post ;-) The difference is that McGill actually supports his conclusions with the state's own data! This book is right on target, exposing an eco-radical agenda that has little to do with saving manatees. The reader comes away with a clear understanding that, if the radicals didn't have the manatee, McGill would no doubt have a ""Save the Palm Rat Club"" to expose. A must-read for anyone who enjoys junk science debunkers like John Stossel and Steven Milloy."
1,This book is successful..... in making a bad situation worse,"After reading this book, I'm not at all surprised at the range of comments by reviewers. The author isn't the first disgruntled citizen with a printing press who thinks the entire world is one big governmental conspiracy. You'll either love this book or hate it. That's pretty obvious from the reviews. If you attempt to remanufacture scientific data to meet your own preconcieved opinion, you can probably find a link between manatees and Al Qaeda. Readers should decide for themselves, but this book reads less like a journalistic expose and more like the random rantings of an unhappy boater."
1,McGill is not a biologist.,Tom McGill is not a biologist and has none of the credentials necessary to question the integrity of scientists. He doesn't even write well.He and his buddy Ron Pritchard are pro-development and simply don't like conservation. This book is junk; avoid it.
4,"Data yes, comment so-so","The author truly believes that regulators have ignored important evidence about the manatee and he is right and has the data to prove it. The truth is that manatees become more endangered the farther (further?) from Florida you get.Here in Florida, we know darn well the manatee is not endangered. Moreover, we know that ""man-made,"" whether it's canals or channels or power plants, have in fact made the critter flourish. (I'd made a cruel joke about the manatee being a bellwether for global warming -- the warmer it gets, the more there are -- but that would probably p**s off everyone.)That said, Tom misses many opportunities to suggest solutions. It's easy to bitch, but tough to solve. Nonetheless, he's telling the rest of the world what we in Florida have already realized. There is a conspiracy of ignorance, and Tom does a good job laying out the evidence."
4,Accurate in-depth analysis of the Manatee problem,This book presents a compelling case for changes in the way the manatee is managed in Florida. Mr. McGill has done a complete and comprehensive analysis of the facts regarding the Florida habitat of the manatee. His engineering background is clearly evident as he gathers and analyzes data to support his recommendations for change. A good read for anyone interested in the plight of the Manatee or a student of government gone awry.
3,"OK, but many limitations","i bought this unit and several accessories from a B & D outlet store. I ran into some limitations and issues that severely limited the use of the system in my home. The major issue I ran into is that the room for which I bought the system is split between two power phases (this is discussed in the troubleshooting instructions), making it impossible to control the room from a single hub. The limitations I encountered had to do with the very limited usefulness of the lamp controllers (separate review) and that the receivers usually do not seem to work if plugged into a surge suppressor. Fortunately, the equipment I bought was deeply discounted at the factory outlet and I was ultimately able to find a use for all but one item (a wall switch)."
5,A mix between Crazy Bone and TI,"After having listened to Nicky Mint's latest work I can truly say that the music industry missed the boat by not allowing him the opportunity to succeed in his quest to purify the rap industry. We should have supported him while his album was hot. I guess now we'll have to enjoy more auto tuned hits from Jamie Foxx and Young Money. Mints if you are out there... on behalf of all your fans I am sorry we didn't do more to keep the dream alive... want some, get some."
2,Bought 4. Expect towrestle with cover fit and LCD problems.,Poor machining and covers do not fit well. The new large video cards (2 slot PCIe width) do not fit. LCD temp displays fail and are dim.
1,my $1 cable worked better than this one,"I'm not sure if this is only supposed to work on Garmins or not, but i bought it to use on other stuff and it does not work at all. I also bought a $1 cable that looks identical, but works much better. Do not buy this. In this case the cheaper one is actually better."

5,finished this bookin two hours.,"this book was great!!! I did not put this book down for a minute. TaniaGrossinger writes like you are in her living room and you are a realpart of her family. If you have been a part of "" the Catskills"" or the"" Borscht Belt "", or wish you had been, do not miss reading this book.rose m."
2,Too little Grossinger's,"My first selection from the Prime Lending Library was a huge disappointment. The vastly interesting story of Grossingers, the Catskills, NYC circa the '50's, 60's & '70's should have been a fascinating read, a delicious slice of Americana. Instead, short shrift was given to the real story in favor of the author's decision to make herself the story. I didn't find her even remotely interesting and her self-absorbed view of the world was tedious. So many chapters were wasted on kids playing, who played with whom, what games they played. Borrowing from Yiddish: OY VEY. The chapters devoted to Tania at college? Bupkis.I really hope someone some day will author the history of Grossingers focusing on the real story, the founders...the guests...the Catskills.The book was well written so 2 stars."
5,Growing Up At Grossinger's,"If you don't know Tania Grossinger personally, as has been my extreme good fortune, reading ""Growing Up at Grossinger's"" is the next best thing! The story of her young years, her mother, her family, the celebrities in and out of the hotel and her life--it's all one hugely entertaining, fascinating parade of personalities and characters. Tania's incredibly astute insights about people were of great interest to me as you see her grow from a vulnerable young girl to a sophisticated woman. Tania has a million stories to tell and the ones in ""Growing Up at Grossinger's"" will leave you with a wonderful, warm feeling that you've actually ""met"" an extraordinary personwho has lived a most fascinating life and shares it so well with all of us. Thank you, Tania!"
4,It was good.,"I started reading the third book in the series (Laurel) and didn't like it that much. When I borrowed Lily I didn't think that it would good but it was. It was a bit predictible, though."
5,Beautiful but for younger kids,"The puzzle looks beautiful but I wish there was more info provided as to what age it is appropriate for. This one is for 6+, which I found out after the puzzle arrived. It was meant for my daughter's 9th birthday. I wish I knew it before, this might be too easy for her. Otherwise, it has outstanding colors and graphics. Great price too."
1,Big Mistake!,"I bought this item as i needed something to cool off my living room in my small apartment. It claims to cool the surrouding room temp by 12 degrees. That is bull. Even with 50 plus ice cubes, both ice packs and a full tank of water this unit is worthless. My regular fan does a better job than this thing."
2,It doesn't shut up!,"There is nothing like waking up at 2AM few nights in a row to the voice saying "" O is for Olive"". Keep in mind that it takes you a few moments before you can correctly determine that it is a puzzle talking, and not an intruder or ""voices"" that you are now hearing. (I completely panicked the first two times). And it will keep repeating the phrase 20+ times (I counted), so you will HAVE to get out of bed, in the middle of the night to look for a screwdriver, so that you can take out the batteries, because there is no off switch!"
3,False self-promotion?,"Ours works okay except for the T, which is unreliable. We can live with that, but I'm a bit irked that it says, ""Now I know my ABC's"" with notes across the bottom of the front implying that it will also emit the alphabet song, but it doesn't. Mind you, it doesn't say it DOES on the description on the back, but I still think it's misleading.The previous reviewer's one sounds like a real dud - I'd ask to exchange it as there are alphabet puzzles without sound (including a couple from Melissa and Doug) with more cleanly and attractively shaped letters at a lower price). This is apparently a good item to buy with caution and where it can be easily exchanged for one that works (try it out on the spot if it doesn't need to be still in the packaging when you give it to your child.)"
2,Puzzling Alphabet puzzle,"This puzzle does not work well, their number puzzle works a little better. It uses light sensors under the letters to trigger the audio. When you place a letter the puzzle states A is for ... The problem is any sensor your hand shadows causes the audio for that letter to sound. This is confusing to a child trying to learn his/her letters. And sometimes it gets stuck on a letter and just keeps repeating for no apparent reason. My 3 year old son does not show much interest in it."
1,Bad sound quality,"The puzzle is nice enough, but the sound quality is terrible. We took the batteries out because it was annoying and hard to hear what letter is said. Works fine as an alphabet puzzle, but don't bother with the batteries."
4,Cant get enough of them,"These biscuits are so conveniently packaged for lunch boxes, the kids love them, I just wish they were sweetened by fruit juice (apple or grapes)."
2,not enough updates,noticed half the articles seem to be more then a day + old. needs more updates to be really useful.
2,The news is okay but updates are too infrequent,"When I first subscribed and read the first issue, it seemed like a very good blog. The problem, it turns out, is that new articles occur too infrequently. For example, while my (excellent but a touch on the geeky side) ""Ars Technica"" blog has about 5 to 10 new entries each day, ""AP Technology"" blog averages about one new entry each two or so days. I'm going to cancel ""AP Technology"" and stick with ""Ars Technica""."
3,so-so,"I ordered this hose nozzle and also the Toro 8 spray garden hose nozzle. I wish I had ordered two of the Toro nozzles. The Bon-Aire has four settings which is ok, but there is no indication on the nozzle head which spray it is set to. It is easy to turn and feels like good quality, but the Toro is fantastic! I would recommend another type that is labeled so you can choose which spray you want before you turn your hose on."
3,Not crazy about this product,"No doubt, this nozzle is built like a tank. The problem is that the spray isn't as adjustible as I would like. For use around the house, a better choice would be one of the nozzles that allows you to dial to several different kinds of sprays. This one gives you a jet or a soaker, but not many other options."
5,Not bad,I bought it at Gold box special for around $15Used it for a couple of times and found nothing wrong with product so far. Gives me good control of water pressure
2,Doesn't work like described,"I was hoping that this would be the end-all-be-all of my garden hose issues. I have been tired of getting cheap plastic ones that crack or spray more on you than the plants you are trying to spray. I decided to go with this one because it seemed solid and it is. My issue is that you really only have two settings on it. Squirt or gush, the other settings don't really work. For the price, it is built very well but doesn't do the other settings which I am very disappointed about. For a $20 Hose nozzle...it should just work."
2,Ripped off at home & garden show,"I bought two of these nozzles at a home and garden show recently. Neither produces the forceful stream of water that was demonstrated at the sales booth. On the flip side, the restricted flow feature really works well for watering delicate flowers and the construction appears to be solid. Since the feature that was touted specifically was the intense stream that could be achieved, the purchase was a bust."
4,the best nozzle I've owned so far,"I only wish the ""jet-spray"" setting was a little more jet spray like.... other than that, it works great, and hasn't leaked..."
5,"So good, i bought a second one!","I got tired of buying inexpensive plastic nozzles at the 'big'box' hardware stores. They are cheap pieces of garbage. This nozzle is ""solid"". Has a good variable pattern and good pressure. Just know that it does not work for a fine mist for gentle watering."
5,Great for car washing! and lots of other uses as well!,"I ordered this awhile ago, but until now we haven't used it for what I really bought it for, which is car washing. We've used it to water grass and it works well for that. I ordered it right after we washed our Ford Escape the last time, and we just washed it this morning, for first time since then. It is wonderful. We love the wide variation of settings, and being able to get a positive shutoff of water without having to walk clear to the hose bib to turn it off between first and last rinses! In our part of the country, water is an especially precious commodity, so we're careful not to waste it. There's a sorta soft spray that is perfect for rinsing the soap off without spraying mud back onto the tires, which was an annoyance w/ other hose nozzles we've tried."
3,Not what we expected,"My husband used one of these nozzles at a friends house and said it was the best he ever used. He raved about it for weeks so I ordered one for him. Same name, same look but he says it's not the same at all. The old one was like a pressure washer at one setting and had many different sprays. This is pretty ordinary as far as nozzles go....I'm guessing like many things these days, it's just not built like it used to be."
2,Disappointing,I bought this nozzle based on reviews that it was good for washing cars. I have to say that I am thorougly disappointed in the water pressure. I am considering re-attaching my multi-use gardening nozzle since it's jet stream is comparable to this Bon Aire product.
2,Broke after a few days,"I bought my first one from the company at a plant show and LOVE it. I bought the next one from Amazon for my backyard. They are like two completely different nozzles. They look exactly the same on the outside, but the mechanism on the original one is MUCH smoother, and the water pattern is MUCH better than the one I got from Amazon. I don't know if these ones are new or if they are refurbished. All I can say is the one from Amazon broke in 3 days and leaked. Amazon sent me another one quickly, but the second one from Amazon does not work as well as my original nozzle."
5,hose nozzle,great hose nozzle/easy to use/good spray patterns/would not think twice about ordering this product again/my wife likes the nozzle too
3,Solid well built,I like this nozzle and suspect it may be a super performer - however it takes a lot of water and I don't have the pressure/flow to know how it can perform. It is very well made. If you have the water this should be a heck of a nozzle.
2,Head the other reviews - check your water pressure first!,"I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing. I live at one of the higher points in town (600 ft) with psi of 35-40, and I can confirm that the results are very disappointing. Yes, I do have heavy duty 5/8"" and 3/4"" hoses that I tired it with. The pressure is far less than with the Melnor Titanium Guns that I had been using, which costs around $10. The Bon-Aire has a nice soaker pressure that is better than the Melnor, hence the two stars. The nozzle really is nicely and sturdily designed, and I wish it worked, but I'm going to return it."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,Avoid this product. It leaked immediately! It obviously is poorly made; plus the stream it produces is not very strong. There are much better products for less money. I am disappointed.
3,Not the Ultimate Hoze Nozzle,This hose nozzle is okay but does not come close to living up to its billing. While better than the cheaper spray nozzles it leaves a good bit to be desired. There is good flow but the spray pattern is not as tight and controlled as one would expect. It might not be a bad choice for the money but if you are looking for the best nozzle this is not it.
3,Nice Nozzle,"At least this nozzle is engineered for home water pressure and does not require a 1,000 GPM Fire Engine to drive it!! The 'fog' spray setting is a bit uneven but it screws down to make a very long stream nicely."
5,Awesome Nozzle,"I just bought this sprayer, and it is by far the best Nozzle for a hose. I never write reviews, but I always read them, and believe me I was blown away by this product. I just bought two more. One for the front of my house, and one more for my pool area. AWESOME.. A+"
2,Beware Bon-Aire products,"Bon-Aire products are likely to prematurely fail. Beware. I used mine a dozen times before it broke. Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days, so you'll be stuck."
1,My breakproof nozzle broke,"I've owned this nozzle for a year now under normal home use and was very satisfied with it until the large plastic (fiberglass?) valve fractured and came off inside the aluminum housing. It's got a ""lifetime warranty"", but a ""return to sender""mailing address. After this experience and expense, a brass nozzle from Ace hardware will once again serve me just fine. Buyer beware!"
1,Nozzle Fizzle: A year later it doesn't work,"We loved our Ultimate Hose Nozzle when we got it last season. Fantastic and easy to use. Unfortunately, now this spring we went to use it and all that we get is a pathetic dribble. It's back to the good old generic hose nozzle for me. They may not be as cool, but they work for longer than a year and they are a lot cheaper."
1,After 3 months Bon-Aire housing blew the inner seal. Now junk!,"Maybe what one person said about the Bon-Aire being manufactured in China is true. Bought in April 2009 and the housing blew after a short time of use and really no way to get inside and fix it. The allen adjustment doesn't help. Now the water comes out 2 places and it's just a good soaker nozzle now. As it's a water waster maybe they will have a Cash For Clunkers nozzle program someday?Update 12/10/11A lot of people read these so I'll further explain my opinion of the product. I agree, Amazon is great! The problem is with a product like this, Amazon has little recourse on the seller after the warranty expires. This nozzle works fine for the first few months in daily use and might last a year or more in light use. The problem is that the inner o-rings are not compatible with the water in some areas. If the water is questionable in your area (hard with minerals) I'd stick to a simple brass nozzle that's available on Amazon as well."
2,low pressure,"low volume water pressure compared to my first purchase of this product, maybe due to my not purchasing the suggusted hose to go with it that i purchased with my first one purchased. Either way I am very dissapointed with the low volume of water pressure that I am now getting."
4,Great quality; high pressure a little weak,"Seems to be built like a tank and handles abuse well. The high pressure setting is not quite as high as some cheaper nozzles I've had, but I can overlook that in light of all the positives the Bon-Aire delivers. I especially like how it can be turned off by spinning it clockwise or counter-clockwise."
5,Simple and strong,This is perfect for a regular back yard. Simple to use and sturdy enough to throw around. Just slide it in and change the flow from a strong stream across lawn to gentler rain in closer or for large potted plants. I use it with varied spray strengths to sweep leaves across the top of the lawn to a group I can easily pick up.
4,Nice quality product,"It does need high water pressure and a 5/8"" inch hose to perform at expected levels. But if you put it on a large hose and crank the pressure up it works very well. I would order again."
2,buy another sprayer,"Excited by all the great reviews, I ripped open the package and screwed on my new nozzle. First I tried to water the plants on my patio. The water either splattered too hard or trickled out too slowly. There is not a nice softer spray to effectively water plants. Okay, I thought to myself, ""Maybe this will work great to hose down the patio."" Wrong again. I put the fire hose type nozzle back on so I could get a lot of pressure. Now I am mystified why this nozzle is getting great reviews. My $7 hose sprayer is back on my hose so I can easily water my plants. Maybe the nozzle will last a long time, but it won't make a difference to me. I am no longer using it."
5,Everyone should have one,"Sadly mine came in pink... Apart from that, sturdy, easy and super customizable water hosing. And making it all rubberized was such a great idea, cause I drop mine all the time when I switch from hosing down the car and sponging!"
2,Didn't last very long,"I looked for a good quality nozzle, something that would work better and last longer than the home-center junk. I thought I had found it. It worked fine for a couple of months, but then started leaking-badly. I took it apart to find the O-ring that seals the two pieces of the body was cut (simply by the action of adjusting the stream-very poor design). I went to the hardware store and picked up a new O-ring and it is sealing once again. It appears that, based on the design, it will fail again before long. Most people would have tossed it when it started pouring water out, but I gave it a second chance.Bottom line: Don't buy it unless you are prepared to ""fix it"" when it starts leaking (pouring) water out and based on the design, that looks like it will be a frequent occurrence."
1,Waste of good money,"At the price and advertising I expected more. Boy was I disappointed! It doesn't work any better than a regular, inexpensive nozzle. Sorry, guys, great advertising blitz, poor performance!"
4,Bon-Air hose nozzle,I like this nozzle because you turn it one way or the other depending on the spray you want. Very durable I wash a lot of cars
3,nozzle,"not what I expected, not real powerful. Price was right, I wouldn't buy it again. color was alright. very durable"
4,bon-aire aluminum hose nozzle,"Good product, I do not get inadvertently sprayed when dropping it between uses. I had one previously and it lasted for three years in the arizona heat."
5,The best nozzle around,My husband and I first saw one of these at the Alameda County Fair. We have since bought 3 - a spare for us and the others are gifts.
5,hose spray nozzle,"easy to attach without leakage, multiple levels of spray, able to shut off spray with nozzle---very nice"
1,worthless,i bought two of these last year and they are a waste of money the old nozzle i have that is about 50 yrs old is much better save your money and buy a cheap one instead should have sent them back do not like at all
5,Who knew you could excited over a hose nozzle,"Just check my review title, says it all. I'm a middle aged car nut and have had countless hose nozzles over the years. This is by far the best yet.Great versatility for car washing and plant watering. Wish I had gotten more than one under the lightning deal this was purchased under."
3,They don't make them like they used to,"I bought one of these years ago and I really liked it. Last winter I forgot to remove it from the hose and the Bon-Aire nozzle fused to the hose connection. Different metals reacting with each other will do this. The replacement I ordered this spring is not as good as my old one. Specifically, my old Bon-Aire would produce a fine mist at one end of the twist, but the new one will not. I'm guessing the manufacturing tolerances are not very precise. That said, the Bon-Aire is better than the piece of junk imitation sold by Tractor Supply Company."
4,Nozzle leaked after 4 months!,"Nozzle is great for gardening, car wash, driveway etc. After 4 months nozzle started to leak, easily fixed by taking out screw and cleaning or replacing O ring. Highly recommend."
5,Best nozzle ever !!!!!!,Why this is not a nozzle for gardening it is a great nozzle for washing cars!!!!!!!! This nozzle is very durable so you do not have to worry about throwing it down on cement and breaking the nozzle or it land in the perfect position to soak you.
2,Dissapointed....Not what I expected,"My water pressure is not great and this sprayer does not help. I much prefer my old nozzle sprayer with the turn and click choice of different sprays built into the the head. This one is just not good for watering, but it is ok for car washing."
2,You Better have LOTS of pressure!,"I bought mine at the local county faire. It worked great in the display, but when I hooked it up at home, BLAH. The setting we use most, the wide-shower, was hardly a shower at all. The flow was low and the pattern was MUCH to heavy for delicate plants.The distributor GLADLY and quickly sent a replacement, which also aperformed in a like manner, so I checked our pressure. We have 85 lbs. PLUS at the bib, however we use a 100' hose, and an hydraulic hose reel. That device dropped the pressure to about 44 lbs.After replacing the hose with a 50' one, performance increased. Still, the wide spray pattern was nothing like what I saw at the demo. Additionally, to obtain this setting, it takes a bit of fidgeting back-and-forth in order to get it just right.Overall, it's STILL not the ultimate nozzle,... just so-so."
2,Ok if you like to drench,"Bit of a let down here. From all the reviews, I thought maybe my search for the perfect nozzle would come to an end. It didn't. The sequencing of spray patterns on this nozzle is not what you are used to. Sure, it has a unique ability to produce a fine spray and a fire hose kind of effect, but when switching between patterns it passes mostly through various streams of concentrated water that dench anything in its way. If you are trying not to splatter mud, create craters or wash away feshly planted seeds, this is not your nozzle. Maybe it makes more sense on cars."
5,Excellent! Nice hard spray when needed,We have a well so the water pressure here is not very high like we used to have in city. This nozzle converts that aspect into a nice hard spray that goes probably 50 feet or more. Great for cleaning car wheels or nailing the dog for fun across the yard. Highly recommend it for anyone in a lower-flow situation. Just wish there was a shower head around that could do this in the bathtub!It also has lesser hard sprays as you dial the nozzle for for watering flowers. Prompt service and very please with product.
3,Bon-Aire hose Nozzle,"I saw this hose nozzle used at a home show and it looked great. The design is good and the quality is very good, however without either alot of pressure or more water volume, it doesn't really work well for its intended multiple purposes."
4,***,I bought one of these about 7 years ago. It was the greatest thing. I just bought 3 more and they're still great but I don't think they have the power that my old one does. I was a little disappointed but not enough to not buy one. More pricey than they use to be too.
3,"3 stars for overall design, minus 2 stars for short life","Purchased this nozzle over a year ago. I loved it at first because one reviewer stated that you could run over it with your auto and it would not be damaged. Now, however, the inside aluminum piece just fell out. It was stored outside all year with the hose water turned on, so I am wondering if freezing water inside the unit ruined it. I am ordering a different nozzle to try out this time (one with a trigger mechanism) because I didn't like having to turn that rubber sleeve each time I wanted to turn it on. While it only lasted one year, and my own mistreatment of it may have contributed to its failure (outside freezing water), I enjoyed it more than other nozzles I have thus far tried - it really shot the water out a good distance and the pressure and flow pattern could be changed easily."
5,"Exactly what I was looking for, heavy duty/high quality","I was tired of low quality hose nozzles, so I looked around on Amazon for a good replacement. This fit the bill perfectly. When I took this out of the packaging, you can immediately feel the quality. It has a good heft to it, feels extremely sturdy, and glides nicely when turned. This feels like it will last a lifetime."
4,Great nozzle that should lastc,"Quality product works great and I love that it turns off both directions it is turned, a feature not found on most. Just wish I had better pressure at my house but feel it is no fault of the nozzle. Great for watering tender vegetation or pressure washing the bugs of the automobile grill."
1,Broke after 8 months,"I was happy with this nozzle until it broke. The outer black handle (where you adjust the spray) no longer grips the nozzle mechanism and turns freely. Meaning I cant turn on/off or adjust the spray pattern. For this kind of money I could have bought 4 ""cheap"" nozzles and threw one away a year and still come out ahead."
4,In case of fire,"Got this for my son since he lives in the desert area and would be a great item for cleaning the truck. {His first comment was he didn't need it to fight fires}but it would come in very handy for when he did have to wash the truck, or water the small area of grass. Works great with the double shutoff for low or high pressure rinse."
1,Broke after 6 weeks.,"Have yet to find a hose nozzle that will last a whole summer. The Amazon.com product description of this Bon-Aire nozzle states, ""built for a lifetime of use..."". Mine broke after 6 weeks of light use. The gasket assembly inside the housing is so flimsy that it is easily dislodged, therefore disrupting the spray pattern and causing major leakage when the nozzle is in the off position. There is no warranty info. of any kind listed on the product package."
1,Not enough pressure,"Based on the other reviews I thought this would be good in the stream mode with good pressure. It is not. I got a part plastic nozzle from a local hardware for about $7 which has much more streaming pressure. I have no pressure reducer on the incoming water, and am using a commercial grade 5/8"" hose (same one used with both nozzles). This item is obviously of good quality with metal parts and easy to turn control. The spraying modes are fine, just the streaming which is really inadequate. I have changed back to the $7 nozzle for car washing, side of house washing. (I have a pressure washer but would have liked something to use for everyday-type things, without having to use the pressure washer.) Don't buy this if you need good pressure because it won't deliver."
1,Substantial Pressure Required,"While this product appears to be well made, the water pressure in the area where I live (45 psi) is insufficient to get acceptable performance from this nozzle. By the way, I was using the recommended 5/8"" ID hose."
2,Pressure-pressure-pressure,As a previous reviewer stated this nozzle requires a high water pressure to realize its full potential. I live in the country with my own well and the pump pressure is set to 60 psi max which is not high enough to get a strong blasting/flushing stream. However my wife likes it because it does a good job at watering her plants on the deck.
4,no nonsense hose nozzle,"wash the car, water the lawn this is the nozzle to get. We just replaced out funky traditional nozzle and hope this nozzle lasts. It's doing well so far."
3,Same as Craftsman,"This design is OEMed by many brands. Craftsman has the same one. As per the other (low) reviews, they will inevitably break if you leave it out over the winter. Either the fiberglass reinforced/nylon insert will break or the top and bottom halves internally separate and it leaks in the middle. If you like this product, my suggestion would be to buy the Craftsman and return if/when it breaks at the local Sears....they offer Lifetime warranty on the product. Also, don't let it freeze!"
3,"Good for high pressure, not for low","The high pressure stream that comes out of this nozzle is great. However, the low pressure stream (like what you might use to water plants) is not so great. I like the control, look, and feel of the nozzle, but I have to use two nozzles to accomplish all the tasks I need to."
1,Junk after 5 months....,"Paid $30 and it worked for about 5 months and blew the inner seal. This nozzle sounds good in theory but is actual very poorly designed. After the seal broke I tested to see how strong the nozzle was and was able to break it in half with my my hands effortlessly. I strongly suggest going with another product.:Update 7-25-2011: Avoid scam products like this cheap terribly made nozzle here. I used mine very carefully and it still broke in 5 months. 30 years of this nozzle at a 5 month lifetime would cost you (30x12months)/5months = 72 nozzles for 30 years at $20.87 per nozzle (price + shipping) = $1502.64Spend a tiny bit extra now, save thousands later, and get ""The Finest Water Hose Nozzle"" by Griot's Garage. $90 but WELL worth it. It won't break, ever. Or just keep buying these Break Air Nozzles over and over and spend your thousands of hard earned dollars on China's crap products.[...]"
1,It broke,"I thought this was going to be a good nozzle, then it just totally locked up. You can't turn it at all what a waste of money and I can't return it.,,,,"
2,HOSED,"THIS NOZZLE DID NOT PERFORM AS EXPECTED... IT'S STREAM WAS ERRATIC AND UNSTABLE. AFTER A FEW SECONDS AT ONE SETTING IT WOULD CHANGE TO ANOTHER. THE NOZZLE SEEMED TO BE DURABLE, BUT NOT CONSTRUCTED WELL. I COULD DO A BETTER JOB WITH A $5.00 NOZZLE FROM WALMART."
4,Buena Calidad excelente pues en México no las he visto,"Parece de bomberos, para mi jardin esta muy bien, tengo poca presión en casa y funciona muy bien!!! Buen producto olvidate de las Truper!!!Mi papa la vio y le gusto que tuve que regalarle una. He leido que falla con la presion pero la verdad con la presión normal en mi casa funciona muy bien. Para regar el jardin esta perfecta. El mango es un poco ancho pero es por el hule que la recubre, lo cual le da calidad y durabilidad.Olvidate de las Truper!!!"
3,Good nozzle - a bit underwhelming,"It works as it should for the most part. I had the chance to try it out quite a few times over the last summer drought. It does flow well but my older Nelson nozzle (can't find model here on Amazon) seems to flow a little batter. If you do not have good pressure to start with then this nozzle, or any nozzle for that matter, is not going to help much. I am lucky with great pressure, so less restrictive nozzles do make a difference. The spray pattern adjustment is more smooth with the Nelson where this one can be touchy with a tendency to overadjust. A good nozzle but definitely not 5-star worthy."
4,Bon-Aire Nozzle,I have this nozzle already and want to buy two more.They are great and durable. I paid $30 for it at gardensupply and to see it for $15 here on Amazon Yeah! I'm ordering right now.
1,What a mess,"1st off, it uses 3 AAA batteries. 2nd, the product manual link on the page is inoperative. No way to set the time which is visable in the desplay."
5,"happy, bouncy poetry","Wonderful book. Both my kids (one year and three) love the rhythm - my 3 year old has it memorized, the baby starts to smile as I start the first verse. The illustrations are bright and cheerful - very eye-catching for a baby. There is no way a baby/toddler could not love this book!"
5,Wonderful,"Our baby started ""reading"" this in the tub from about 4 months. At 19 months she still loves it. The verse was easily memorized and can get a smile out of her in or out of the tub. The other Baby Einstein bath books are cute, but this one is by far my (and her) favorite."
2,Doesn't make sense.,"The first page of this books says, ""Let's use our hands and feet to count how many kinds (of water) there are..."" Great, so we're going to count the different kinds of water? Nope. That's the last mention of counting the water in the book.Another page says, ""Waterfalls with misty breath whisper as they flow."" No they don't! Waterfalls roar down the mountain and make a big splash. Whisper may rhyme with ""mist,"" but if we're supposed to be teaching about water, let's not lie for the sake of a rhyme.Someone already mentioned the next page about frozen water becoming ice rather than *being* ice.Daughter loves this book in the tub, but we make up our own words about the pictures. Words that actually teach her about water. Sometimes we even <gasp!> *count* the kinds of water in the book."
1,Don't let the baby chew on it!,This book is made of toxic plastic. You have probably heard the latest news about plastic stuff. I already forgot which one because I threw mine out. I don't know maybe now they started making it of some other material but I bought mine in 2005.
5,Great Water Fun,"My 6 mo old loves the book. He plays w/it in the tub every time he is getting a bath. The poem is very pleasant & the illustrations are informative, bright & colorful. Great find for the chewing babies & their rough/grabby little hands."
3,Fun to read (and chew on),"This book is fun to read to a baby of any age. My son (who is 6 months) sometimes likes to look at the pictures, but also likes to chew on the book (gums only of course), which is perfectly fine since it is made of a waterproof material similar to that of an inner tube. Not my favorite book in the collection, but I do like taking it out from time to time."
2,"Boring, lame rhymes","I didn't like this book, and my 5 month old daughter wasn't interested either. I bought this because my daughter loved ""Mimi's Toes"" so much, I thought this would be similar as a rhyming book. It wasn't! Rhymes are forced, and there's no nice rhythm to the book. My daughter just looked away bored, but when I pull out Mimi's Toes, she gets excited again.The illustrations are nice, but that's about all. I wish they put more effort into the words. We also miss the repeat lines that Mimi's Toes had. Babies love to recognize the same line over and over."
3,Bash Guard works,"I put this bash guard through its paces in a Colorado elk hunt. It does its job for the most part,but has a couple of drawbacks. First, it does not protect the screen (perhaps the most sensitive portion of the device. Also, it is very difficult to get on and off of the device with the frequent battery changes."
4,Looks Like A Great Product ... But I'm an Idot. Read on.,"Okay, this is my fault. Since the description just said ""Garmin Bash Guard for Rino Series"" I thought it would fit my Rino ... my Rino 530 HCx, that is. Oh, no, no, no. It will not.Going back and reading the Technical Specs it clearly says which models of the ""Rino Series"" it fits. I understand this is my fault and now will lose money on my return.So just beware, Rino 520 and 530 users. It's way too small. And Garmin doesn't make a Bash Guard (that I can find) that fits our model, sad to say.Otherwise, it looks like it would have been a great thing for trekkin in the woods."
3,Garmin Rino 110 covers,"Although this product doesn't protect the screen, it fits well enough to prevent rubbing and is a bit more ""skid"" proof. Tends to stay where you put it. It needs to be removed to change the batteries, but it is pretty easy to do. I also tend to use these units on a bike, so it doesn't work with the holder with it on.I think the major use is to change the color/look of the Rino, it makes it easier to visually see what unit it is without turning it on. I have used it a couple of times, will see how robust it is later..."
3,guess it works...,"I guess it protects against some things, but (for example), didn't prevent screen from being cracked.It's also a bit annoying to get on and off if you're changing the batteries regularly."
2,Does not fit the 500 series rino's,"These are great, if you don't have the 520 or 530. I gave them to my buddy who has the 130 and he loved it."
2,Not really all that...,"My GF and I have been looking for a good balsamic for a while now, so we were really looking forward to trying this one - especially with all the great reviews! BUT, what a total disappointment! There is no ""depth"" of flavor in this bottle. It is about as one-dimensional as any balsamic vinegar I've had - at much less cost. I can't recommend this product at all."
5,Staple item in my pantry,"I am a professional chef and work on mega yachts all around the world. This is one of the finest authentic Balsamics available. I always have some whether I am in my own kitchen or working in someone elses. It is great with fresh summer tomatoes, over grilled vegetables or just on some rustic bread with olive oil. Expensive yes, but well worth the price. Used sparingly it should last a few months..."
5,Best Balsamic,Wonderful aged balsamic. Purchased a bottle a couple of years ago and used it very sparingly as you can since it is a rich deep flavorful drizzle. Great on fresh sliced tomatos and drizzled on cheese. Worth the price.
4,"Very Good, Authentic Balsamic Vinegar, Good Price","I ordered this vinegar based on the great reviews, and I was not disappointed. Sweet, lightly tart and syrupy, very similar to balsamic vinegar I had in Reggio Emilia in Italy. There are ""finer"" balsamic vinegars, but for the price this will do very well. Only drawback - the bottle does not pour very well, and the vinegar tends to drip down the sides. I will buy this vinegar again."
4,Yummy..,"I received it as a gift. It is very yummy but I couldn't see anywhere on the package how ""aged"" the balsamic was."
5,Brad scores a 10!,My family is reading all of Thor's Scott Harvath books and enjoying as we learn from every page of his thrillers.
4,Explained before,"Already explained under 'Path of the Assasin' so please review my previous post. Unlike the author, I don't like repeating myself."
4,Brad Thor at top of his game!,"Well developed characters, page turning action, Islamic protagonist, and Scott Harvath. What more do you need? Keep them coming, Brad."
1,Terrible,"As a lover of contemporary fiction, I cannot describe the level of frustration I had reading this book. Though much balyhoo'd in its editorial review and it's enthralling inside jacket overview, Thor's depiction of a massive terrorist attack on New York City was shallow to point of amateurish. His descriptive words of choice have less color than the ink they're printed with (""The terrorists came in fast, but he shot them dead""). His ubiquitous cast of characters all started with the letter ""H"" for some dreadful reason, and the character development was nil. Thor also likes to show off his detailed knowledge for tactical weaponry and gear, but nobody outside of the special forces understand (or cares) what gauge bore the gun of a tertiary character is holding- especially when the story is so flat. This was the first book I can remember having to put down before reaching the end, because I just couldn't stand it anymore."
2,Not my book,I've read stories dealing with German and Russian conflicts and enjoyed them immensely. This book deals with terrorists of our current histories. I could not picture the story as it was unfolding during my reading. I forced myself to read past the first 100 pages andf had to put it down. Just could not read this book.
2,200 pages out of 430 describing a,"I was very disappointed from that book. It is describing a very un-realisticstory about terrorist that have too much intelligence.They know locations of super top secrete places. (as if the head of CIA is their mole...)They penetrate those protected places with ease. Killing with ease.Sorry. Books are supposed to be imaginative, but in this book it was more like a fantasy.How come Vince Flynn recommended the book. Flynn's book are on amuch much higher scale !!"
3,Decent,"Thor's worst yet. Harvath did not exactly ""save"" the day this time. The terrorists killed thousands of New Yorkers before he could do anything and he was always a step or three behind. The terrorist attack idea that he came up with was no doubt genius though and the complexity of the attack was good. The ending was the best part and set up a story for a awesome sequel. In general I am a huge fan of Brad Thor's work but this one was not like his others, but even his worst is of the best."
1,Very Disappointing,"I'm sorry I wasted my time with this. There is absolutely no believable character development. It is pretty much nothing but juvenile, corny, and pseudo-macho ""action."" It was the first Brad Thor book I've read and I won't be reading anymore."
5,The door is left ajar,"""Takedown"" was written with the usual apblomb linking Scott Horvath with his creator, Brad Thor. This latest episode of America's favorite agent of terror against terrorists assures his readers that we have not heard to last of either of them. The devastating, but not unrealistic ending to this novel whetted my appetite and leaves me ready for the next adventure. Hopefully Mr. Thor will not leave me, or any of us, waiting too long. A superior read for any season."
1,Disappointing,"This was my first Brad Thor novel and I found it to be disappointing. Normally I love the action thriller type of book written by authors such as Clive Cussler, Vince Flynn, Tom Clancy and others. But this book is extremely disjointed with a lot of content that contributes nothing to the story. There were a few elements of interest like the troll but most of it is dull featuring a fairly incompetent hero Scott Harvath. I doubt I will read another Brad Thor novel because I don't trust that the book will be well written."
1,Takedown is a letdown,"This has been one of the most disappointing adventures in reading that I can remember. Normally I would not bother to write a review, but this book was such a downer that a comment was needed. Why the author felt that any American would want to see our guys be out smarted, maneuvered and gunned by Muslim terrorists is beyond me. To my dismay I actually read to the end in hopes that some uplifting thing might happen. Only to have it jerked away on the last page."
3,S.O.S,O. K. Same old Brad Thor. Harvath is good but some it is a little hard to accept. Black List is a good model.
4,FASCINATING,I FEEL I KNOW HIS CHARACTERS AND AND HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ACT AND REACT. THEY ARE VERY REAL AND HAVE BECOME ALMOST FRIENDS
4,Entertaining and engaging,"The first of this author's books I've read, I found it to be fun and entertaining to read. It did seem to drag a little in the middle, but by the time I was there I was hooked and it was easy to get through. I plan to read more by this author."
2,Shilling?,Best I can tell from reading a couple of this guy's books is that he is a shill for DHS and friends.
3,More Terror in New York City,"This book is a bit how you would expect it to be. Islamic terrorists strike New York City killing scores of people and wreak havoc on Manhattan, which also happens to be the current location of covert officers operating under the law. Not surprisingly, weapons are quickly assembled, information is gathered and a chase ensues. The story moves rapidly and I stayed interested until the end, but the book is average for this genre. The author left the book wide open for a sequential story. Who knows if I'll get to the next book or not."
4,Fast Paced Action Thriller,"In this fifth installment of the Scott Harvath series by Brad Thor, the radical Islamic terrorists have targeted New York City, and in a massive way. Scott and team spend a lot of time a step behind the terrorists. And, as with previous novels, the question is asked, is it OK to torture individuals who have the information that would save thousands of American lives? This one seemed to have a much higher body count than the previous books, even not counting the thousands of Americans killed in the attack itself. Overall, a fast, action paced read."
5,Another Great Book,"Well, I bought this book last Saturday, promptly laid down the current book I was reading, and started to read ""Takedown"". It took me about 2-1/2 days to finish it and I have to say it was great. Definitely one of the best action/thrillers out there. I have read all five of Brad's books and would place this one as number 2 (Lions being #1).I have read other authors to include Vince Flynn, David Baldacci, John Grisham, Dan Brown, Tom Clancy, Alex Kava, Clive Cussler, Robert Ludlum, Ken Follett but my top two favorites have to be Brad and Vince. Both are awesome military style/good guy writers and I highly encourage everyone to read both authors books. I anxiously await Scot Harvath's next adventure and hope he avenges the death of someone (I won't ruin the story for those who haven't read it) at the end of Takedown.To a previous reviewer, I don't think it was the Troll who is the murderer but someone else who Scot knows."
2,Needs more lessons from Vince Flynn,"Brad Thor's Takedown has an exciting plot, a conventional hero (lots of reader comparisons to Jack Ryan, etc.), and far far too much lecture about how the constitution must be suspended to protect our country. Frankly, the lectures are obtrusive and interfere with this reader's enjoyment of the suspense and the plot. Vince Flynn's characters hold similar attitudes, one deduces, but Flynn doea not bludgeon the reader with the party line. Nor does Daniel Silva whose Gabriel Allon is also a swashbuckling hero. Please, Mr. Thor, back off the lectures and put more effort into character development and making sure the transitions are handled competently. Let the exposition make the point, not thinly disguised authorial commentary. When that occurs, I'd very much like to read more thrillers by Brad Thor, but meanwhile, I'll stick with the Ludlum successors, with Flynn, Clancy, Silva, Child, and other more skilled writers of thrillers."
3,"Better than Patriot, but has similar flaws","Speaking as a high-crime-area police detective (retired) this book has some of the same nonsense in it as The Last Patriot. I'm speaking of situations where the ""hero"" becomes a weak-kneed pansy at the first sight of a bad guy's gun and immediately drops his gun and surrenders. What nonsense! This never ever happens in the real world to real Special Ops guys, or experienced big city street cops for that matter. It's just plain silly olde lady type BS. Mr. Thor you need to seek a lot more input and advice from real-world professional shooters before publishing your next work."
5,TAKEDOWN,"If you are a follower of BRAD THOR, you will not be disappointed in reading TAKEDOWN. I think it is possibly the best of the THOR books that I have read. The rating system AMAZON uses allows a choice of up to five stars BUT I would give it nine stars if I could. Seriously, it is a good read and it is easily tied into the world the way it is today. Interesting enough, I finished this book on September 11, 2010."
5,Thor's Best Yet!!!!!!!!!!!,"Within the first couple of chapters I was gasping for air and canceling my plans for the night. Few people capture the international war on terror in such vivid detail as Thor, esp. as he has in Takedown.This is easily Thor's best novel to date and in the last week, no less than three (3) people where I work have come up and asked me if I have read this book (which of course I have).In short, this book lives up to all of its buzz and will be THE book you'll see people reading everywhere this summer. Like all of the others here who have reviewed this book, I can say with 100% certainty that you will totally love this novel. I'm glad Brad Thor (& Scot Harvath) are on our side.Mr. Thor, Takedown is fabulous and I can't wait for your next one!"
3,"enjoyable, but don't think too much","The book was enjoyable for a summer read. Of course it's a one man army against the evil terrorists and everyone else is just backdrop. The worst thing about it was the killing of the girlfriend at the end, just plain stupid. I'm going to get back at you for trying to kill me by hunting you down across the ocean just to kill a woman you've known what, a week??? And leave you totally uninjurred?? Yeah that hurts!! So as long as you don't take it too seriously and don't think too much you can read it and enjoy it."
4,VERY good book.,"If you like the scot harvath series you will not be disappointed with this one. Its a very fast-paced story, Very hard to put down. One of the best in the series."
5,Typical Brad Thor...Great Read,"For anyone not familiar with Scot Harvath and is interested in thriller,spy,corruption and action type novels, there missing out. Blowback is a typical Scot Harvath (Brad Thor) novel. Bad guys attack America and an american hero (Scot Harvath) comes to clean it up. If you enjoy thrillers and action these books are for you. I can easily see these books transformed into a movie like ""Shooter"" or even the ""Bourne Triliogy"". The books are fast paced and read pretty quickly. A good read for anyone."
1,Caution -- this volume is an abridged version,"The Everyman's Library edition of Casanova is abridged from the original, and the Amazon.com description does not note the fact."
3,Kind of flat,"I found Firebirds kind of flat. I think the best children's stories can be read at many levels. Think of ""The Hobbit,"" which appeals to readers ranging from roughly third or fourth grade all the way up to adulthood. At the simplest level there is just an easily accessible story which appeals to a very young and uncomplicated person. At other levels the story should appeal to more sophisticated readers: there might be complex moral decisions, satirical references only an adult would catch, interesting use of language, etc. I know that all the authors featured in ""Firebirds"" are capable of writing for multiple audiences, but (other than Wynne-Jones's ""Little Dot"") I found the work presented here somewhat disappointing. It wasn't horrible; it just didn't have the richness I expected from a collection of writers this talented."
3,Not what I thought it would be...,"This anthology has one basic problem, though I guess I should have known better, as the problem is that, as an anthology, there are over a dozen writers who have composed short stories for it. It's hard to like everyone's style of writing, even if the genre is the same. As it was, I only liked three of the stories - Michael Cadnum's Medusa, Sherwood Smith's Beauty, and Kara Dalkey's The Lady of the Ice Garden. Stories like Lloyd Alexander's Max Mondrosch and Nancy Springer's Mariposa I thought were a relentless bore, and there was even a comic strip in the book - totally out of place. This book really gives you a taste of the entire spectrum of sci fi and fantasy. However, if you're like me with your tastes already centered on a certain area of the genre and certain authors, beware. Consider this a warning if you, like me, can't appreciate all aspects of sci fi/fantasy."
5,"""Firebirds"" is a Must-Read Anthology","This is the first anthology I have ever read and I absolutely loved it. Almost all of the stories in here are of highest quality. The collection gets off to a great start with ""Cotilion"" by Nancy Springer, which is an incredible Tam Lin spinoff. ""Medusa"" by Michael Cadnum is another great piece, told from the title character's point of view. ""Max Monderasch"" by Lloyd Alexander and ""Hope Chest"" by Garth Nix are disturbing yet thought-provoking stories. (I personally found ""Max Monderasch"" eerily realistic yet comically entertaining.) However, my favorite piece is ""Floatsam"" by Nina Kiriki Hoffman. All in all, this is a must-read collection for YA fantasy fans. Don't miss it!"
3,Worth Reading,"Highly readable, well researched, especially regarding many statistics. The author sets out to prove a point, but this bias, while evident, is not a distraction."
3,"If you do buy it, be patient.....","Some concerts should just be forgotten when they're over, and not preserved via live recordings. Yes, there is a teensy little bit of Lenny Breau guitar work here, but you sure won't hear it in the first 25 minutes of this lame, short-weight CD, which is mostly taken up with off-key singing and ham-fisted Canadian ""humor"" while Lenny waits -- and waits -- to play some music. This is definitely the least interesting Lenny Breau CD that I've ever heard, and one you could live without unless you're an absolute fanatical collector. If you take the plunge and acquire this CD, do be patient. And most likely, you'll never listen to it a second time."
5,"Lives up to the ""Classic"" in the title.",This is a favorite album that I play over and over again. It holds up well over time. My favorite performances by some of the artists.
1,Toshiba Satellite Laptops,"Keep away from it. I bought my laptop about 18 months ago. First the power adaptor blew up within first 6 months. Then keyboard and on-off switch were gone. Everytime, when I called them Toshiba service was very indifferent to my troubles. It took about a week to fix the problem. Since, they are big on COMPANY POLICIES they can not give a replacement adaptor or a keyboard until they get one in. COMPANY POLICIES are the big words for the representatives.Recently, the built in mouse was gone and DVD/CD combo drive was broken as well. Could be a motherboard problem. Now, they claim that since warranty is only one year, I have to pay for the repairs. I have already spent 150 to get a spare adaptor, an external keyboard and a mouse."
1,AVOID THIS COMPUTER AND TOSHIBA!!!,"I bought this computer and within 6 months the motherboard needed replacing - it has now been in the shop for two months waiting on Toshiba to ship the replacement motherboard ($700 for the part and $200 for the service). Each week, the date of arrival of the motherboard changes and I have since bought another computer as I have no idea when (if ever!) Toshiba will supply the part. Considering the cost of the computer, I am irate that the repair is both so costly and so time-consuming. I will never buy a Toshiba product again, and suggest you pass on this problematic machine."
4,Wonderful,"I have had this laptop for 3 months and could not be happier. Like the other reviewer, the cursor does bounce when you are typing, that is because it is easy to tap the mouse pad with your Right Thumb. The solution is easy- don't touch the pad. I would also suggest upgrading to XP pro- It's just better."
4,"Nice, but hot!","If you buy this laptop, it would be very wise of you to buy one of those cooling pads with the fans in them. The laptop itself is friggin awesome, wireless everything! Nice size screen, and very clear. I have never had a single problem, other than the heat it generates. I would recommend it only with the cooling pad. Oh and also, I could not find a suitable case either (below) and had to settle with a piece of carry-on luggage myself... Case Logic :)"
1,Pass on this one,"This laptop generates way too much heat. It has a built in feature to automatically shut down if it gets too hot.IT SHUTS DOWN ALL THE TIME WITHOUT WARNING!Toshiba you have a major design flaw here!BTW - I did install the BIOS patch that was suppossed to correct the problem - ha - whatever, the laptop still heats up and shuts down without warning!"
1,Avoid Toshiba,"It's the second toshiba I own, and I will now try to avoid the brand.After-sales and warranty services are a mess, even more so when you are in France. Had to send my other Toshiba 5 times to service centre because of the mistakes they made the first time.Quality-wise, you will always have the colour that wears off, or plastic pieces that fall (from USB).Am looking to buy a third laptop, but not a Toshiba."
4,I replaced my desktop with this,"I replaced my desktop with this and have been very happy. I love the large screen - I did put XP pro on it fresh, as it comes with a lot of software I don't use. Plus a lot of the Toshiba software phones home - so be safe I did a clean install. No problems, I have another Toshiba for work the Tecra M1 - But always find myself using this one. Yes it's a few bucks more - but you will get more life out of it - and if it saves you from replacing it for 1 extra year your ahead of the game, I took away 1 star for the heat this generates. I think I could cook a hotdog while using it. :>Another issue is I've had to have the CD replaced twice, I also have to time to time blow out the vent for cooling as dust get in there and it tends to overheat. Make that three times now for the CD going bad, get the extended warrenty or you'll be paying for CD drive replacements all the time."
5,very enjoyavble,"I use acrylic paints and still this DVD is fun and informative. My wife and I have both picked up a few techniques and have incorporated them into our painting. Thank's Bob, we all miss you."

5,J-Tripz delivers an instant classic,"For those who don't know, J-Tripz and the NCP have been local legends in San Jose for over a decade now. Mr. Hudson's long awaited debut was well worth the wait. J-Tripz larger than life persona comes through loud and clear on this disk with tracks like 3...2...1 Contact and Clap the Nation. J-Tripz is a true original with a rapping style all his own and the kinda voice most MC's would kill for. Chicken Wingz, Gritz and Spitz definitely has a party oriented theme throughout and J-Tripz humor shines through on every track. Do yourself a favor and grab 2005's party album of the year."
4,"10 kt Golld, Opal and Diamond Pendent","I ordered this pendant a little before my wifes birthday and checked free ""expedited"" shiping. I was dubious about the expedited shipping and thought it would probably take 1-2 weeks to get it, well after my wifes birthday Suprise, the company was as good as their word. The necklace arrived within 2 days and in excellent condition. The pendant is delicate and attractive and the most important thing is my wife loved it. Bottom line: a big thumbs up to vendors that follow through and provide quality merchandise. I wish they all did. Signed: Happy in NM."
5,Drakengard 2= Drakengard + 1,"this game here has what drakengard should've got. First off....that thing about allies only being out for a certian amount of time is finish (thank god) now all u have to do is switch to the allies weapon to change to him/her. And thank you...no creepy music. Instead, the music is a lot more cheery and story is kind of the same thing....but a lot more conspiracy related. which i think makes u think more about what is happening. ok...to the gameplay, basically same thing...smash that square button and hope for the best right? WRONG! they've twisted it a little...now u use the triangle for a nice little upper cut slice giving u an opprutunity to finish a baddy in the air! and that circle for the weapons...that now includes potions and crystals and stuff for ur enjoyment. well...basically...this game is Drakengard + 1!"
5,Great machine,"It's a bargain for what it does. Super easy to set up with an informative instruction manual. I sew as a hobby, and it takes care of all my project needs. The stitch selection bars on the side of the machine are very intuitive, so it's easy to change your stitches without second guessing. I highly recommend this machine."
2,There is a very big flaw in this product,"I got my AT&T Caller ID model 326 about a month ago, and i've had to change the batteries 2 times already!!! That is rediculous. It takes 3 AAA batteries (not 2 AA batteries like it says in the description). And yes, i did buy brand new batteries both times ;) This Caller ID box would be great if the batteries lasted longer. The other review for this product says that it ""lights up when the phone rings"" which is false. I think this guy was talking about a different caller ID box. Mine looks exactly like the picture up there."
4,Spanish Women,The movie arrived on time and in perfect condition. Movie shown well but I do not speak Spanish and could not get the subtitles to work. Although I was able to get the gist of the movie.
5,Good economical choice,I have my home theater projector located across the room from a DVD player. I needed a long HDMI cable to interconnect them. This cable was perfect to extend the original HDMI cable that came with the projector. I taped around the two connectors because others said they might come loose easily. So far I have had no problem mechanically or electrically. Performance is flawless and the price is right.
1,Do Not Waste Your Time Or Money,"It arrived on time. It did absolutely nothing for my ailment even though I kept hoping and kept trying the recommended dosage and even upped it a time or two to see if anything would happen. It also looked remarkably similar, ok..the exact same..to another product I had purchased from another site, by a different name. Tiny little white pellets. Neither product worked, BTW.When we are desperate, we will try anything. I think these people found that out many years ago. Do I have 'sucker' written on my forehead? They probably have a product to remedy THAT as well...I am giving up on Homeopathic 'meds'."
3,Exactly as advertised.,I found the book to be exactly as advertised. It is a compendium of newspaper articles from The Charlotte Observer following the career of Dale Earnhardt. The book was not meant to be a history of Dale's career. I was somewhat disappointed in the photographs and the physical layout--the colors on some of the pages made it difficult to read-- but overall got exactly what I paid for.
2,Not good,"#3 should have a better looking book that this hardcover. David Poole does a nice intro, but the rest of the book fails badly..."
1,0 stars,Alot of fluff and bad pictures. The Observer has been advertising this for months and I'm very dissapointed in the end result.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"This is the European title of Mr. Hayes American novel ""The Ways of Darkness"". Do not be taken advantage of the change as I was. There is NO difference. It actually is a 5-star book, but I'm only giving it one due to the money I wasted by not telling me this upfront."
4,Nice classic game.,"Considering this is an older game from the past I really can't judge it based on graphics or anything. At the time they were pretty good considering the very small size of the game itself. Too bad I didn't get this ""Rise of the Triad - The Hunt Begins"" on CD-Rom the FULL version like I paid for though. But that doesn't affect the review of this product. The seller I ended up buying from sent me a shareware copy on a 3.5 floppy."
4,Interest fictional tale of esponiage and the technolgy theft,"The book spins a story of the Chinese following a US technology that evenually falls onto the budget chopping block. The Chinese successfully complete development ( finds the technological break through) which can change the power balance in the world. The main character is an University Prof (a normal guy, not Indiana Jones or James Bond) who is enlisted by the US Military to uncover what has happened. The novel is accurate in methods of technology theft occur and how politics can get in the way of progress. The story is very believable. I have purchased several copies to give as gifts."
5,Best Punk Album in years,This album grows on you so quickly. The only drawback for the album being that it isn't long enough.
3,"All in all, a well rounded jungle CD, although bass is slow.","A good CD compilation of some decent jungle songs. The bass gets a little slow on some tracks, but the drums and percussion are right on par with other Jungle releases. This CD is excellent for those who are just getting into jungle, as the tracks contain little by way of mixed in effects. If you like this, go look for a Moonshine records release, such as Jungle Warfare."
2,"A pop band, duh!","This truly ain't a metal band. First of all, the singer's voice bugs be to no end. If you have positive things to say about it, listen to Little Fighter (a.k.a. Little Father) and you'll hate it as much as I do. It's just annoying! Tell Me and Wait are okay, but the rest is pure pop garbage. There are something like 6 ballads on here, which annoys me. If your'e looking for another band who calls themselves rock, but in reality are just pop, with something like 50 ballads, see Bon Jovi"
2,Disgusting!,"Like another reviewer clearly stated, this is not a metal band, but a pop band in disguise. The stupid singer's voice is almost unbearable, the songs are ballad-ish and too pop like. The only thing that saves this from being a one star album are the songs Tell Me and Wait. Those are actually pretty good songs. But the rest is disgusting. i just don't get how this band got any commercial success in the late 80's world of metal. When The Children Cry has got to be one of the most lame, dumb, idiotic ballads ever. AWORD OF WARNIN': THIS AIN'T NO METAL ALBUM"
2,Pass on this,"I should have known that this simple film camera wasn't going to work out because there are zero reviews for it anywhere. But how could one point and shoot camera be that bad?When we opened the box, the camera wasn't the same as the one we ordered. It bothered me a little, but whatever- I was sure the one I got was nice as well. Put the batteries in but the camera never worked."
5,great teaching tool,"Frank Peretti is hilarious and uses his talents to help children better understand Bible stories. He makes it easy for them to apply to their lives, also."
5,She Loved It!,She definitely loved the pendant. Got here nice and quickly and came packaged quite well and safely so absolutely nothing happened to it. Thanks a lot!
4,Great crime story,"The Inspector Hanaud books were famous during Mason's lifetime and very popular. If you like Agatha Christie style books you should like this too.Personally I prefer his other books such asThe DrumandThe Broken Road, but that is a personal preference as regards the subject matter. The book itself is just as well-written as the others."
4,Much better than I expected,"These nesting tables look great, and they are good quality too. I'm very impressed. They get compliments from guests.I have two complaints. I thought the small table could slide out from under the larger one, but it can't: you need to lift the large one off the small one. This means, for me, having to clear stuff off the top one first. That's a bit of a hassle. I'm disinclined to use them for this reason.Secondly, there was some quite noticeable damage to the wood on the bottom rings. I considered returning them for a replacement, but I was too lazy."
4,The late Lino Leitao's only novel,"After reading José Eduardo Agualusa's excellent travelogue called ""A Stranger in Goa"" and Neeru Nanda's short story collection called ""If"", I got thirsty for more books set in India. Fortunately, the late Lino Leitao's only novel, ""The Gift of the Holy Cross"", quenched my thirst.If you're interested in reading a novel set in Goa and, at the same time, you want to learn about the complex culture and history of this region, this is the book for you. In a couple of chapters, it gets a bit too political and historical for my taste, making it seem more an essay than a novel, but its unexpected twists kept me interested reading it the whole time.However, I was left with a few questions about Nirmala, as well as Mario's behavior at Casa Portuguesa, unanswered. Other than that, I thought that the author did an amazing job at not falling into clichés."
1,Ughhhh,"Ok, just like most people I came into contact with this band via the hit game ""Guitar Hero"". Ok, so I bought the songs after completing the game and played through both of them (GH1 and GH2). I was amazed, because the programmers obviously went through their album to find the best tracks to incorporate.....and the best tracks they could find are dull, uninspired, and just godawful. I would literally wear a razor-blade condom before listening to their album.....LITERALLY. I would literally listen to Creed or watch a Jamie Kennedy movie than listen to their album.....and that says a hell of a lot about this talentless garbage known as 'Made in Mexico'.Made in Mexico = Frank Zappa - Talent - Intelligence - Interest - CreativityI urge you to NOT buy this CD, unless you're into deep physical and mental pain. The group is the ""Manos: Hands of Fate"" of the musical world."
1,Flakey and Incomplete,"I entirely agree with the previous reviewer. I'm currently using this book for my mechanics course and I find the text inadequate as a learning tool. In fact, I am currently looking for another book to supplement the missing ideas, explanations and concepts. My recommendation is to avoid this book if possible."
2,"Dull, uninspired, and incomplete","Its been a while since I have used the text, but my recollections (and those of all of my peers) are that it was, in general, a very poor text. Many topics have large holes in their explanations, the examples are weak, and the problems are generally more challenging than the level of an undergraduate Classical Dynamics class requires."
2,Lack of explanations renders it unsuitable for an undergraduate course,"I remember that I and many others in my class agreed that this book fails as an undergraduate text. Baierlein does not give very helpful explanations, which leads to misunderstandings or even a complete lack of comprehension in the reader. In addition to that, many of the problems are extremely challenging. This was my first upper-level physics course and I also had a visiting professor unused to teaching; it is possible that this book could be successful in a graduate course, or that it could be salvaged by a truly excellent and experienced professor. I, however, would have preferred to use a different book."
1,Anachronic book,"I could not agree more with the previous two reviewers. We are probably talking about the worst mechanics book in the market. There are big gaps in the logic, no clear motivations for the steps taken toward any result. To understand this book, the student basically has to write the other half of it: the mathematics and the explanations. Avoid this book by all means."
3,It was a little hard to get into,"I enjoyed this book after I got into, dont give up on it you will like it"
4,Very well researched incidents of hauntings in America,I enjoyed this book a lot because of the intricate detail and extreme work that went into this book. Good use of the original sources. A must have for anyone interested in American History...
3,An eclectic compilation of North American ghost stories,"Norman and Scott's ""Historic Haunted America"" is a diverse collection of ghost stories culled from the folklore of the United States and Canada. The book rarely delivers a story that is as ""shocking"" as its jacket promises; most of the anecdotes are obviously legends that have been passed down from one generation to the next and, as a result, have lost much of their emotional impact. However, a few stories do provide the chills and thrills so necessary to a book of the nonfiction horror genre. Norman and Scott have extensively researched North America's famous hauntings and this quality and thoroughness shows up in their finished product. Although a few stories are rather dull and repetitive, as a whole ""Haunted America"" is entertaining reading for afficionados of folklore and horror alike."
3,Dull,"I keep reading thinking it will get interesting, but it doesn't. Some stories seem to go on forever, others are very short - but there are no verifications of actual hauntings, just dry stories you might tell around the campfire where no one gets the least bit frightened. You may think such things as spirits may exist, but this book won't convince you."
5,Dust Mop Treatment,SYS2080 - Dust Mop Treatment 12 Cans per Case 18-oz. Aerosol CanThis stuff is amazing. It really works. I love it!!!!
5,One of the top 10 cd's of all time,"In Terms of Drum N' Bass, This is the best, in terms of greatness among music in general, this ranks among the top ten. The best drum n bass songs are compiled and selected for this glorous complimation of Drum n bass music."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this to be a stand-alone phone for a home office. Although this phone seemed packed with features, there were a several things that detract. 1) If you're on one line the answering machine will not answer if another call comes in. 2) The answering machine can not be selectively turned on or off for individual lines. 3) Poor sound quality on the recordings as well as VERY low sound volume when picking up messages remotely. 4) My unit had a defective power supply (LOUD hum) and AT&T would not replace it w/o sending in the whole unit. Not good, stay away."
2,Has one major problem,"Bought three of these phones for a small office. All features worked reasonably well with the exception of voice mail. Recorded message quality is poor. The major issue is the same as described by reviewer Laura G related to DTAD & Auto Attendant. I did succeed with AT&T tech support when they told me it was a known issue related to line disconnect signal strength. If your system carrier is unable to adjust strength, then do not buy these phones! AT&T advised me to return the phones."
2,Not happy with phone or seller,"This phone has all the features that I want. It also has a feature that I DON'T want! Whenever there is a power interruption...you lose everything!Almost all settings and directories! It has a battery back-up...but as far as I'm concerned, it don't work. It also must a chip..because very vew of the settings survive a power failure. (unimportant things like the area code survive). I now have to spend an extra $50.00 getting an AC battery back-up for it. I really give it a ""1""As far as the seller....I contacted Stratton products (seller) asking to send it back and they never responded, I give them a ""-1"""
1,AT&T 964 review,"After reading other reviews from other customers, I think it would be wise for AT&T to either replace this phone with another corrected model to the 12 station package, or correct the problemon all there 964 phones.,or just discontinue these phones andcome up with a new system. The color could be better also.(Dove Gray?). & the buttons a little bigger."
1,Did not deliver on promises,I purchased this phone with high expectations based off product features especially the auto attendant. We purchased 2 each 944 and 2 eacch 964. This was for a small office (2 people) The 944 phones worked together but the 964 phones did not. The manual was the worst to date I have read on a phone system and gave no detail. After countless hours with support staff on phone (email support was a joke they copied sections from manual and sent them to me even though I had described following every step of the manual to them in detail) it was determined that while they advertised it would work with any anaolg line system it would not work ours because our system had been upgraded by BellSouth. During course of events I found out that it was common for the phones not to work together. The system never worked as promised and phone manufacture gave up trying to solve problem.
1,Terrible System,"I have a small business and purchased three of these phones, and all are absolutely a piece of junk. The answering machine was very important for me because patients need to leave messages. First, the outgoing message is so faint and full of static, it sounds as though I'm calling from space. Second, it does not take messages as promised, and as a result I have my ""face ripped off"" all day long for not answering patient's urgent calls. Of course, I had to buy THREE of them--which makes it all so special--NOT!"
1,It does not deserve the one star rating,I purchased one 964 and three 955 for my real estate business. The answering machine was very important to me. I only hope that I can return these lousy phones.
1,Yuk! I couldn't believe this was for real.,"I purchased two phones for my home business and immediately discovered that callers sounded like they were from Mars. The voice was so faint I figured it must be my phone lines; surely this couldn't happen with two brand spankin' new phones. Nope, it wasn't the lines, it was the stupid phones. Both had the same problem. I didn't even get a chance to try out the other features since the main purpose of a telephone is to talk."
1,JUNK,"THE AT&T 964 was a piece of JUNK from that start. It should never have been sold, and paying the top dollar for it was differently wrong. I should have gone to WAL-mart and brought a $19.00 one. If it is any idea how AT&T is I will not buy their products any more. The company should have recalled this junk and refunded the money!"
3,Will change your life,"In Jane Goodall's book Harvest for Hope, she explains the benefits of eating organic and local grown food. The government seems to be taking the small family farms out of business by growing and selling food cheaper. And consumers have no idea what they are eating anymore. They do not know where their food is from and what chemicals are both on and injected into their food. Harvest for Hope also shows the horrors that food animals go through before they are slaughtered. It will make readers consider becoming vegetarians, probably ones that do not even eat dairy food or eggs. Goodall also explains how readers can change the world, one purchase at a time. Harvest for Hope will definitely open readers' eyes. They will begin to take a closer look at how they shop for food. They may even give up eating meat. Even if they do not, all readers will question their food after reading Harvest for Hope."
2,Hoping For More,This book was more about Jane's views on food than on food itself. Good book if you are a fan of her work. Bad choice if you are buying it for any insight regarding the culinary industry.
2,used,"It's used and looks not so new. However, I just need a book that can be read. So it's OK for me."
3,"good book, bad copy","This is a good book, but my copy arrived kind of beat up looking. Since it was going to be a gift for my niece, I had to send it back. Beware of the books labeled BARGAIN. They are not first quality copies like the description states."
4,Harvest for hope,"A wonderfully, inspiring book. Jane Goodall communicates her fears and vision for the future in a sensitive, passionate and lively way. Although a documentary, the book reads like a good novel."
5,Harvest of Hope,This book by Jane Goodall really speaks to how interconnected our health is to the foods we choose to eat.
1,"Extraordinay times, execellently written","Truly a book I could relate to. Having lived in that era and same lifestyle. Having been brought up on a large cotton farm & remembering the differences between blacks & whites. There was a special bond between blacks & whites when they lived & worked together in the fields & in the homes. Mr. Hunt has shown that even though the differences were great that there was also much love & compassion far each other. Reading this book makes you feel as though you are right there with them, learning to love & live peacefully & happily with EVERYONE, no matter the color. This is a book everyone should read. He gets 5 stars from this reader."
2,A touching story,"""The Last Witness From A Dirt Road"" is a wonderful read - heartfelt, warm, and thoughtful. Full of funny scenes and conversations, poignant descriptions of people and places, and touching portraits of the friends who filled his childhood, it is a true, complete, fulfilling tale of growth, with all its joys and pains. The book conveys with honesty and sensitivity the confusing emotional and intellectual chasm of growing up between the races in the southern United States in the mid-twentieth century. Sadly, the black and white worlds Mr. Hunt describes can't blend any more than allowed by the vision of a child's affectionate and colorblind eyes. Nonethteless, Mr. Hunt manages to capture a very real and tangible love between people; he is a solid storyteller and a talented dialogist who has given us a sweet, memorable tale. Months from reading it, I still carry the images with me - and some laughter, too."
2,Better reference than a textbook,"This is probably better as a reference book than a text book. The chapters, while not long, feel excruciatingly drawn out. This book makes me feel stupid. On a positive note, if you can understand the concepts presented at the beginning of each chapter, the chapters end with lots of lesson ideas."
3,it's okay,"this book is very useful for tesol students use in the pedagogical grammar course. if you wish to become an english teacher then, read it. I bought an used one, not bad. 90% new."
5,Still use this book after 3 decades,"I first bought this book in the early 1980s, while at a conference in Vermont at the (then) School for International Living. I never give it to students, but I use it myself. It helps me frame grammatical explanations that students will understand, even if they lack much explicit grammatical knowledge. I love that it is more about using grammar than about naming pieces of grammar, and it's been part of my toolkit on 3 continents as I've taught students from everywhere (except Antarctica).In a Linked-In group at the moment there is a conversation about ""which 10 books would you carry with you"" to teach. This is one of mine, and has been for about 30 years."
5,Perfect condition,I've never thought of the book would be in this perfect condition as if it has never been used. It's only about half price compared with most of the book stores here. Definitely a wonderful purchasing experience with the low price provided.
2,Vastly Over-Rated,"Much as I hate to disagree with my colleagues, I found this book to be poorly written, overly verbose and beyond dull. Common grammar terms were not used, nor was the extensive terminology adequately explained. There was no glossary and the in-text definitions were incomplete. The index was inadequate. I have taught grammar for 20+ years, and have had classes in 5 different languages. I would *never* inflict so much useless information on my own students because it would confuse them. It confused me! Normally, *nouns* are inflected and *verbs* conjugated; not here! This was especially frustrating because of the high price of the book."
5,Great Buy!!,This is a great resource for a home/classroom reference library. It has very clear explanations but goes much further into depth than most grammar books. It's a keeper!
4,Well Done!!!,Ordered the book for a college course. I took a little longer than I expected but arrived prompty after I contacted the seller and in great condition.
3,Not up to Flashman standards,"As a lover of the Harry Flashman books by Frazier, I found Mr. American to be a bit of a disappointment. I guess I miss the romance and adventure, not to mention the humor, of his other novels. Nor does it have the zip found in Frazier's non-fiction Quartered Safe Out Here. A nice enough read....END"
4,good old fashioned story telling,"When I hear someone say "" curl up with a good book"" , I'm never sure what they mean until I read Mr. American. This book kept my interest to the end which was 500 pages later. It is just good old fashioned story telling with characters you care about. I became so engrossed, that whenever ""our hero "" said or did something I thought he would regret, I found my self yelling out loud, exhorting him to reconsider. Good stuff !"
5,Brilliant Historical Fiction,I've read all of Fraser's books and I consider this one of the best. I just re-read it after a gap of 8 years. I enjoyed it immensely. It should be read by all fans of Flash Harry.
4,A must for Buffy novel fans,"Golden and Holder prove themselves once again to be the masters of the Buffy books. ""Immortal"" brings the unique spin with vampire mythology by showcasing a vampire who is truly immortal (as opposed to the immortal type that can be dusted with a stake and that's it) as Buffy's latest foe. With the story well backed up with a mythology explanation and the dead-on characterizations, this book is almost like reading an episode of the show. Recommended."
5,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer - ""Immortal""","Golden and Holder have long been the most talked-about, most respected, and let's face it: the best Buffy-authors around. This book let's them shine again and show everyone how they got that reputation. This is easily the greatest Buffy novel since the Gatekeeper Trilogy, and Veronique is such a great villain that you end the book just WISHING that they'd incorporate her into the show. The flashback interludes are well-written and the characters are all written true enough that you'd think Joss Whedon himself wrote it. All in all, a great book, one that any Buffy fan should enjoy."
4,Immortal Book Review,"I ordered this book off the internet for christmas, but when I recieved it in the mail I automatically started reading it and my parents couldn't wrap it because I couldn't put it down. The book is great if your into things about just straight vampires and everything, but if your like me and want more of a Buffy Angel plot and about where they can't be together because Angel is a vampire....this probably wouldn't be a book for you because there was little of that. But all in all......it was a great book!"
2,Buffy To The Rescue,"What can you say about Buffy The Vampire Slayer that hasn't already been said? IMMORTAL is a typical Buffy story, with the typical cast of characters and the typical formula plot. Fun, but Shakespere is in no danger of being replaced. The biggest letdown of the audio version was, sadly, Charisma Carpenter, or Cordelia to her fans. The lady is an adequate actor, but her reading skills need a LOT of work! This could have been a more enjoyable program with a better narrator. Sorry, Cordy!"
2,Boring but good new characters,This book was suppose to be all dramatic abut it justcame on as boring and pointless. I like the new charactersthough. Another dragged on Buffy-and-Angel-can't-be-together-book if you ask me.END
5,Book great. Tape ?,"As always, Golden and Holder have done a great job with this book. I also bought the tape and was a bit disappointed in Charisma Carpenter's reading. Her attempts at accents are poor and she doesn't drive the story with her reading. The abridgement itself was pretty strong, although it did lose some of the characterization that Golden and Holder are so good at. The book is a must for Buffy fans. As far as the tape goes, it's worth hearing once but I could take it or leave it."
5,Absolutely the best!!!,"If you never read another Buffy book, be sure to read this one. It is absolutely the best of the series next to the Gatekeeper Trilogy, which is another series that I advise you to pick up. The books are well written and I like that all the characters are utilized. The plots are well thought out and very well done. Christopher Golder and Nancy Holder are the best authors in this series and I have read other books out of the series by them."
4,Super Reader,"Buffy's mother is sick, and Buffy also has to deal with an extra powerful female vampire, and her gang.This bunch wants to summon something considerably worse than themselves.Even if Buffy manages to kill the head woman, Veronique, she comes back again as another vampire. Pretty annoying situation to be in, all around."
3,A well-done abridgement of a Buffy novel,"I enjoyed this audiobook on the level of mere fun, ""brain candy,"" for lack of a better way of putting it. I'm quite impressed with Charisma Carpenter's ability to capture the cadence and tones of nearly all the characters, with the exception of the absolute slaughter she has done of Giles' British Accent, and her sometimes mispronounced words (then again, I could be wrong, I was raised British and the difference between British English and American English is quite vast at times).The story is pretty neat, and given a sub-plot of Buffy's mom being really ill in what would be around 3rd Season in the show, it's a nice foreshadow to the eventual plot conclusion of Joyce's character from the series. The notion of an immortal vampire who keeps popping into a new vampire body when her previous one is dusted is pretty nifty. The ritual and the villains Veronique (this immortal vampire) is trying to conjure are quite well crafted. Done well, overall!'Nathan"
5,GOSH.... I LUV THIS BOOK,I read this book bout a year ago... It was soooo great. i really enjoyed reading it. The whole story was suspense packed... I think the title is ambiguous. It relates on the one hand to buffys mom and on the other to the demon. I live in germany and the title over here is THE DEMON OF DEATH or sumthin like that... so i like urs better ;). Everyone who isnt sure if he shall buy this book....well DO IT !!!
3,"Interesting, but ...","The idea of a vampire who can resurrect after being staked is intriguing to this fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This book examines the idea in a much more effective way than the odd season 5 premiere episode ""Buffy vs. Dracula."" The story is well-written; Christopher Golden does a great job developing the plot including throwing in historical sections which give the reader a view into Veronique's experiences over the centuries. There's also a sub-plot about Buffy's mom being ill which curiously foreshadows events of last season.Now for the ""but"" part, so to speak. While the idea is interesting and well-developed, this whole book is a bit more gory than other Buffy novels I've read, and it ends on a depressing note. I still recommend it if you are a fan of the series. I tend to read these during summer hiatus when I am Buffy-deprived."
4,It was a good book,"This book is not one of the best, but it isn't one of the worst. My mother had the same lung surgey about 7 or 8 years ago, so I knew what Buffy was feeling, and my heart really went out to her! The chapter with Veronique back in time are really good, as are the ones with Angel. One chapter that is really cool, though, is the one where Willow channels Lucy Hanover. If you want to know why read the book. If you don't know who Lucy Hanover is you should learn more about the show, or you may be confused!"
2,Good idea - Bad Product,"While most products by Parents are very good, this one simply misses the mark. The markers were defective and the chalk board was impossible to write on. My recommendation is to pass on this product."
5,Budding artist,This is a perfect alternative to a large easel. We are tight on space. I like how all the pieces store inside when it is folded up. My 2 1/2 year old son loves to draw. He loves that he can switch from the dry erase board to the chalkboard. It is easy to clean - the dry erase board needs just a damp cloth. I bought a sponge to clean the chalkboard with as well.
4,Good for little Artists,"My 2 year old son LOVES his little art kit. It travels well, so we take it anytime we visit people who don't have much in the of entertainment for kids. He loves being able to switch between the white board and the black board, and prefers the white board to using paper (which is more economical, anyways). I do have to warn, however, that the lids for the markers were NOT designed with little hands in mind, they are very difficult for him to put back on, and the lids wont snap onto the back of the markers, so you've got to keep track of them. On the upside, the ink washes completely out of clothing."
1,"Downhill Slide to a ""Hey Mickey"" retread.","I liked her first album, thought her second album was mediocre, and really don't like this one. It's like she took all the elements I didn't like from the first two albums and used them exclusively for this one. I guess I'm showing my age, but the first cut, ""Girlfriend"" reminds me of ""Hey Mickey"" by Toni Basil."
2,The worst of Avril's albums.,"Avril's songs are good at the gym when your doing cardio. I've liked all her albums, until this one. I think the right word to describe it would be extreme regression. Just about all the songs and lyrics, sound like they belong on a Mickey Mouse album.And the RIAA is wondering why CD sales are dropping? No effort whatsoever was put into this album. Most of the songs, you just wish you never heard, not even once."
3,Avril does whatever she wants 2,"This new CD is really weard. I only enjoyed 6 out of 12 tracks. And the B-Sides (Alone n the other can't recall @ the moment) r better than the A-Sides. The DVD is very good, coz it shows what the CD really is: something produced in a hurry while she was drunk. She repeats herself in many tracks instead of creating good lyrics she only talks about a Paris Hilton life and shows her pathetic way of living (spraying pepper in her ""friend's"" eyes, etc). Of course we cannot judge her because of one track, but when we have got a whole album saying things such as: ""I couldn't give a damn what you say to me"", ""Always get me what I want"", etc. we know that it is something in her mind. But not everything is lost. We still have got some gr8 tracks such s the ones she show on the DVD (1,2,3,4,9,11,12 in my opinion). For an Avril's trully fan it doesn't matter: we're just here to support her."
1,don't waste your money,I could not even listen to any of the songs completely.. they were just painful. Very dissapointed.. loved her last 2 albums..this one is very bad..
1,What Happened?,"After two great releases, Avril Lavinge proved she was a strong musician and songwriter. Her debut was good, and her sophmore release showed maturation in musicianship and lyrics. However, her third album has taken about 5 steps back and shown that she apparently has some wild oats to sew. This is one of the worst albums of 2007, or maybe one of the 10 worst ever by a major musician. I was very, very dissapointed, as I am sure many fans are. You may like the album if you are 12, but half of it will be censored due to Avril's new proliferation of profanity. What happened? I sure hope none of this has rubbed off on Derek Wembley from Sum 41, if so, we are all in a world of hurt. Avril is still talented, it has just been buried on this album. Hopefully she can get back up after a knockdown."
1,OH MY GOD!!!,"Am I listening to the same Avril Lavigne that 5 years ago made fun of Britney Spears?! And now the sam Avril Lavigne who is making a FOOL out of herself and out of her poor undeserving of this, fans.Dear God!!!I just can't believe my ears!ABSOLUTELY THE WORST DAMN THING IN 2007!!!I am disgusted and repelled by every single second on this album.A HUUGE STEP BACK FOR THE EX-ROCK-PUNK GIRL.But, a HUGE step forward for the cheapest copy of Britney Spears..Britney, get well soon and please return this fu**ed up pop scene in to it's real path!I beg you..Oh, and Avril; Stop making music for the sake of everybody!"
4,An all out sprint!,"+ 1/2 stars. I found this an irresistible piece of bubble gum! This album kicks off with Girlfriend and doesnt let up from there, even the ballads are great. Sure it may be about as punk as Blink 182(Travis Barker contributes drums on three tracks) but how can you not love the bratty, sassy attitude along with a great deal of swearing? Also the layered vocals are very strong. The DVD that comes with it is hilarious and a great look into the recording process. The deluxe is the way to go with the other version being 'clean.'"
2,What Happened?!,"I got this expecting her usual style of music, a little dark and a little pop rock and somehow it became ""bubble gum pop rock"". I really liked her style from her previous two albums, but now it took a really odd turn. Sounds like it was aimed at a teen demographic only."
4,"Good, but not as great","Always been a fan of Avril Lavigne and I looked forward to this CD. While most of what is on it I enjoy, there are some that don't feel like it's better than what she's done before. I don't think it's the best. I don't think it's a step up. I think it's okay, but it's not the greatest. Still, I enjoyed it."
4,Avril's third,"Avril Lavigne's new album contains all the elements that made her previous recordings so successful: catchy pop melodies often infused with a fun rock beat, with some nice ballads thrown in the mix, full of simple but cute lyrics that will please her core demographic (young girls and the rest of us who view her music as a guilty pleasure). Her new album features more of a punk vibe. If you liked her previous releases, you should like this one too. If I were to rank her albums, I'd say this one is slightly better than her last one but her first album is probably still the best."
2,"Yeah, This Album Sucks",For those of you who are fans of Let Go and Under My Skin please don't tarnish your good opinion of Avril by listening to this album because it's absolute garbage. I can't listen to this without laughing- it really is that bad. The only reason I gave it any stars at all are for the three tracks that easily could have appeared as bonus tracks on Under My Skin and are worthy of a download:When You're GoneInnocenceKeep Holding OnThis album blows.
2,"Avril, Why?","I liked Avril's first two CDs and was looking forward to this one. But I have only one word to say about it - why?!There are a few decent songs - ""When You're Gone"" and ""Innocence"". The rest of the tracks are just BAD. Avril is still singing songs that a 16 year old would sing. That was okay when that was her age group; but she really needs to grow up now.Avril comes across as a snotty brat with a too-high opinion of herself on this album.My advice - skip it and buy ""Let Go"" or ""Under My Skin"". While these aren't top-notch albums, they're still good, and WAY better than this ""effort""."
2,Avril's Stumble on the Road to Greatness...,"I agree with many others, and have trouble taking this album seriously...especially after her great freshman and sophmore efforts."
1,"This is the editied CD - To get the unedited CD, you have to...","This is the edited version of the CD. To get the unedited version of the CD, you have to up the extra money for the deluxe package with a worthless DVD on the making of this album. This marketing ploy is unfair to all Avril Lavigne fans. I was extremely upset to have to pay the extra five dollars today to get the version of the album I wanted. If Avril had anything to do with this, piss on her! Go to itunes and pay what you should for the proper songs. I can't believe I am suggesting something like that. It's just sad."
1,This is the CHILDEN'S edition! caution,"I just got this CD, but when I listened to it I discovered in seconds that this edition is EDITED! Beware, donload this album from ITunes or get the DVD advance copy. There's nothing worse than listening to edited music. Do not get this edition unless you are a small child. I returned my copy ASAP.Other than that, I recommend the album, there are ballads as well as the usual rock songs and the subject matter rotates from love to how guys are just jerks."
3,A little disappointed,I loved Avril's last album. It was so mature and the music was great. I just feel like she went a step back with this album. It was more kiddy like. I still like the album some what but I don't see myself listening to this album over and over again like I did with the last one.
5,"Yes, It Is The Best Damn Thing","Why do all you people hate this album? It's not something meant to last forever, it's meant to be listened to and enjoyed. And indeed, it is enjoyable, every song is giddy alt. pop goodness."
5,Great CD,I made the error of buying the CLEAN version - I thought I was buying the one without rap music - turns out I bought the one with missing cursing.Cursing not bad - only cuts out on 4-5 parts - but I wish I bought the regualr versionOtherwise a very good CD. Majority of CD's you buy only 1-2 songs are good - in my opinion all but maybe 2 songs on this cd I like.
2,"The girl with the too much makeup, boys shirts and former hockey player from Ontario needs to...","Get some help next time with lyrics. I mean, I likethe new video and she's cute and all, but grow up!She had too much success with only a pretty goodfirst effort that she was pushed into the sort of'younger Jewel' type mode by greedy rec. Co. Execs.Maybe it's time for her to go back to the great whiteNorth and reactivate her hockey career?"
2,A little to different,"I have her 2 previous albums and I attended her concert a couple years ago. I love her music, so I rushed to the store to get this CD the day it came out. I was not impressed at all with it. It sounds like she is only singing songs that her record company wants her to sing. Her songs were kind of pop-ish before, but this stuff sounds like Britney material."
1,Beyond Cheesy,Somehow her music just gets worse. The album cover itself is actually a pretty good indication of how cheesy the album is!
3,What happened to Avril?,"When I first heard her new single, Girlfriend, everyone had started to say that Avril was selling out. But, I loved the song and bought this CD anyways, and I have to say, it was a disappointment. There's only about 4 songs on the album that I can stand listening to without stopping them a minute in; When You're Gone, Runaway, Innocence, and Keep Holding On. Most of the songs, like I Don't Have To Try, makes you wonder why a 22 year old married singer is releasing songs that should have been on her first album when she was a teenager. Some of the songs just don't fit her age, and quite honestly, they make her sound immature. If anything, most of these songs should have been released by a teenage artist, not Avril.Overall, the CD is worth getting for the 4-5 actual good songs. But if you're expecting this album to be like her last one, Under My Skin, don't even waste your money."
1,Get her off the Nitrous Oxide!!!,"Being a teenager in the Eighties I had enough of ""Hey Micky"" it was bad then and it's bad now. Avril was nothing but throw away pop on her first record, but her second record was like an entire other person and it was very good. This, This, This??This is terrible. Not just a let down, but a bad, bad record. The lyrics are strung-together cliches that required no effort, the music sounds programed and the style is pure, unadulterated, pop garbage. She stepped right in to fill the void left by Britany Spears, that's what she did. Also, it appears she is suffering from Fergie worship.Please, please, someone get her some Tori Amos, Alanis, Sarah McLachlan! Anything to stop her from recording this bland, boring tripe! Why waste the talent shown on the second record, why waste my time and money on this disk. I won't, I downloaded, I deleted. Bad, bad record by any standards.My teeth where rotting from listening to it, it's that sugary."
3,Not the same Avril,"This album is not the same as you may be used to hearing from Avril. The songs are not as ""dark"" as on her other albums. I find them rather annoying actually. I mostly just wanted to let all of you know who are thinking of buying it that....Wal-Mart and Target have only EDITED versions of this CD as far as I am aware. I found a quote from her online today stating that they did edited versions for Target and Wal-Mart. They are not even marked edited, so I didn't know the difference until I popped it in my car! A little irritated, but turns out I don't like the album anyway."
2,An album with potential; lost within each chorus,"There's no doubt that Avril Lavigne has talent and she's very popular right now and pretty much always has been.However, this cd is very mediocre. The bridge has a lot of potential, but then the chorus kicks in and it just sounds so out of place with the rest of the song. She sounds like she just screams for the sake of it sometimes, and the lyrics are childish like they've been written by a little girl, not a fully grown adult.She seems very boy-crazed on this cd. Is it to do with her engagement to the lead singer of Sum 41? Maybe? Who knows.Avril says that this is her best record yet, but I think that it's her worst: Superficial and bland.Good for hardcore Avril fans, but even they might be bored. Tread carefully..."
1,sad waste of good talent,"Not even tracks like ""When You're Gone"" and ""Keep Holding On"" can save the disappointment in this one. For those not wanting explicit lyrics in their music collection, or in their children's music collection, be forewarned. This version is not as ""clean"" as it says. A very offensive and very unnecessary word in her big hit, ""Girlfriends"", is more apparent than absent. This album could have been so much better."
3,The Best Damn Thing Review,"The first song rocks. Every single other song is so bad, I cannot believe it is the same artist. If she had any integrity, she would not even have recorded them."
1,What Happen to Avril??,"This album is nothing like her previous ones. It's not even ""Punk"". The song writing is very poor. It's like she lost something. She changed her image, dyed her hair blond, got a nose job and dress like the people she talked and dogged about. I used to have more respect for her, but now she's says one thing and do another and promise not to be the so called ""SellOuts"". She's a sell out like Christina, and the rest of the bimbo young women out there. Nothing to offer except selling sex. She's cute but nothing else. She need to focus on her music and be less vain like this bimbos out there. The young women in the music industry are all becoming sell-outs!"
2,What the H*** were YOU thinking ??,"Yes indeed Ladies and Gentlemen this has been another exciting episode of BRAT ROCK. The band itself is superb but the lyrics are left wanting with all the foul expletives and uber snotty attitude. Well I guess we should not throw everything out, but not all things can be saved with slick marketing and a set of professional handlers. Hey Avril what happened to your original band--those guys gave you an edge."
3,Pretty good but;,"I went to the store and picked up a copy of this CD. I put it in my car and drove off. Song one starts out great, catchy and upbeat. Then I noticed on the phrase "" I'm the mother fing princess"" is edited. Before I purchased this CD I looked everywhere for a clean or edited label. I saw nothing. I can't believe 4 songs are edited. What gives? No option for the unedited CD? After noticing this after just the first 2 songs I turned it off. Very deceiving and disappointing. Of course I can't return it if they do release an unedited version. Why on earth would her label do this?As for Avril herself, I thought she was coming around to a more mature sound. Not here. Not that it's bad though. But the edit issue is just wrong!"
1,Worst Damn Thing,"Under My Skin was awesome, but this album is sub-par. I'll just pretend this album never happened and hope for the best on the next one. By the way the song ""Hot"" is so not hot. Sorry, Avril, but I expected more from you on this one."
4,this is a fun album,"this is such a fun album. most songs are perfect for the gym. people just like to label and put celebrities in a box and not let them change. this album is just different than her other albums. i see people bashing her as a fake poser,fake punk and that is so immature. you labeled her as one thing and then she evolves to a different artist and you feel like she is fake. wow people get a life!!!"
4,"Bubblegum colour, bubblegum sound","This is Avril's third studio album, and you would think it would mark another level of maturity in her music, as she herself matures into adulthood. At first glance you'd be wrong - this album moves away from the angsty, rocky, moody efforts of the first two albums, and is pure bubblegum pop - a seeming retardation. But if you actually watch the accompanying DVD, you'll understand that Avril wants it to be exactly how it is - it didn't just end up that way through immaturity or being ditzy. This is a different style to the previous studio albums - very upbeat, happy-clappy - but still deals with those same troubling adolescent issues. A new facet to Avril, with catchy little riffs and interesting layered vocals.N.B. I didn't realise this when I purchased the CD, but this is the EXPLICIT version of the album (from Target), and there are several songs with very bad language. I think I'd prefer the toned-down version, in hindsight. Swearing doesn't really suit her."
2,growing older....,"Avril is one of my all time favorites... but in this album she shows she has grown up and run out of juice.... the songs lack spark and inspiration and the arrangements are too ""normal"" to attract any particular interest. I predict she'll fade out from this point on...."
1,Being Fair....I am a fan of hers,"and I really enjoyed her previous works, more than I could have ever imagined, but this record is horrible. The songs are trite, the lyrics are incredibly boring, indulgent and immature. The music is pop staple, with forgetable melodies and repetative chorus lines, I feel as if the studio wrote the entire album for her while she was sleeping, this just doesn't speak to any of her previous works at all. This album fits on the same shelf with a Nickelodeon-themed CD. Instead of heading in the direction of an artist like Alanis Morrisette, she is going backward and joining the ranks of Hannah Montana and the Naked Brothers Band. She is a great artist and her first two records are amazing. She is better than this CD and I am looking forward to her next effort."
3,Kids loved it . . . 'nuf said,"Kids loved it . . . 'nuf said. Better than average pop, but not as good as her previous stuff."
3,What Happened?,"I have to aggree with a lot of the other reviews. I was so excited and was one of the first to run out and buy Avril's new album. Only to find out that it has a very young, ""bubblegum pop"" type of sound. I'll admit I find some of the songs a little catchy but then find myself just laughing at the lyrics. Hopefully she'll come out with some ""older"" sounding songs on her next album."
2,A talented artist wasted.,"The Best Damn Thing by Avril Lavigne is a sad and pathetic album. I liked Avril's Let Go and Under My Skin discs but her third album is as silly as the title itself. I think Avril has a wonderful, strong voice and an average songwriter but I don't know what has happened to her. I guess marriage softened her but this new bubble gum image and that blonde hair has got to go. She has so much talent and she's just throwing it away. It's so disappointing with lyrics like, ""hey, hey, hey you I don't like your girlfriend, I think you need a new one..."" Hopefully my little Candianan will knock it out of the park on her next album. Don't waste your time and money on this trash!"
1,YUCK,"This music, if I even may call it that, is a detriment to any sort of music and the industry of music.TOO BAD I CAN'T GIVE IT ZERO STARS"
1,The Most Disappointing Damn Thing....,"Dear dear me Avril...What the heck have you done here, you've gone from someone who wrote songs with meaning to a total pop flop. I was expecting you to build on what you'd created with your second album but instead you go with this poppy happy go lucky rebel excuse for an album...You've certainly got ""Under my skin"" with disappointment and I'll be sure to ""Let Go"" of this CD"
2,disappointed,"I've been waiting for this release, as I really liked her first two releases - but am glad I borrowed it first. I tried to give it a chance but didn't really care for most of the songs - a major change from her first two cd's - too commercial - should sell well with the pre-teen market - those who's parents don't screen the lyrics first"
3,Hmmmmmm,"Sort of disappointing. Different energy on this one, oh wait...she's happy now, and the music tells all. I enjoyed the fact that I could find solace in her music and curse men and the world all in one bitter lyric. We all can't be happy all the time and it seems it's getting harder to find people to sing about that. Oh well."
1,"A dreadful piece of ""bubblegum pop"" crap.","I've sampled/downloaded a good majority of the songs on this album. After having heard all the songs I realized that it was a complete waste of my time.This crap is worse than even her first album. I thought Avril's second was a very nice improvement and it showed that she had some talent. But THIS is just plain horrible. ""Girlfriend""? Please. It's completely unappealing and I believe that the only reason anyone over the age of 11 would like it is because it's got a ""beat"" to it.That beat from ""Girlfriend"" is pretty much the same exact thing, more or less, in every other damn song on the record.I would not recommend this CD to anyone except young girls... like, in the ""tween"" age."
4,fair,"We have all of Avril's music CDs. This one is my least favorite. It has a couple of good songs on it, but most of the songs sound the same. It does'nt have the same quality as her previous songs. I was a little disapointed in it."
3,She can do better,"After waiting for so long for a new CD, this one let me down. I give it a three just because it is Avril, she is talented and I know that, like she says in one song, she ""can do better"". The music's great, but the lyrics are not. Adding cuss words only makes it worse, since it proves poor imagination in the lyric-writing process; cuss words have an infinite number of rhymes. I don't mind silly songs here and there (Gwen Stefani does it effectively), but 80% of the CD with them...bleh! Might be ok for other artists because that is what you expect from them, but not from Avril. Don't get me wrong, it's great to have some silly fun now and then, but this is not Avril's best. Still, some songs are good, like ""Keep Holding On"". Next album she releases I will have to think twice before buying."
2,Guys my first review and that means disappointment.,Well...First of all as my GF said that she was glad that Avrils ' Cd was on the net stolen two weeks ago. I can profoundly say that she deserved it to be stolen. Let me explain... she said some nasty things about Brittney but she her self hasn't done much better. In music terms i mean.I really really waited for this new CD and as many ppl have hoped it would be as good as Under my skin. They were as me- Very Very disappointed.Where has Avril disappeared... The music is just childish...2 stars were given for Keep Holding on and Girlfriend. Supposedly the only two songs to define this CD.Hope next time she will write smth and not just record to pay off her husbands' expensive bills.
2,Teenie-Bop,I love Avril's earlier work. I was hoping for something more mature and complex. I know she has it in her. This is what happens when the bean counters take control of artistic developement.
2,A message to Avril,The reason that your first album sold so well is that you were in more control. I guess your hangers on are having a greater influence. I borrowed this cd from a friend and I couldn't make it through any of the songs. I saw Avril live when the first album was out. I thought finally an artist that might be someone. I guess I was wrong. This bubblegum tennie bop won't get you far. Maybe if they let you make a new album you might want to try for your roots.
3,Unexpected,"This album is quite a bit of a departure from Avril's previous records. Complete with handclaps and cheer-like chants, The Best Damn Thing is somewhat reminiscent of the girl band pop craze of the nineties though some choice expletives and influences from mainstream pop-punk culture sort of complicate the comparison. This is no masterpiece lyrically or musically and demonstrates an overall lack of maturity in Avril's music when most would expect the opposite from the now 22 year-old, newly wed artist. Even still, this album is quite cute in the catty dance-around-the-room-in-your-underwear sort of way, and I suspect it will serve mainly as the guilty pleasure hidden under beds and in drawers. This album could easily have served as the soundtrack for the movie Bring It On and falls into the category of the pop group the Veronicas. Pass this up if you're looking for something profound, this one is strictly just for fun (if you're brave enough to admit it)..."
1,This is NOT the explicit version,"Beware - Even though Amazon.com lists this CD as the EXPLICIT version, it is not!!! It is the very censored version. My first clue should have been the lack of the Parental Advisory label on the front of the CD. The UPC code matches what Amazon lists online for the EXPLICIT version. I purposely ordered the EXPLICIT version because the MP3 version is not available for download on Rhapsody or Yahoo Music. If I wanted the censored version, I would have saved myself a few dollars.False Advertising."
2,What happened!?,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Avril. But I heard 'Girlfriend' and I knew that something had gone terribly wrong. I loved 'Let Go' and 'Under My Skin.' It's hard to believe that these are all by the same artist. Complete trash. I hope she'll go back to her old 'style' in the next album. Her career will be a dead end if she continues to release 'music' like this. I don't know why most artists completely change their music by the third album. If you're having so much success with your style as it is, why would you change it? I want my money back."
1,Bubblegum junk,"My god, this album is terrible, it sounds like music for a kids Saturday morning TV show. Needless to say I'm unimpressed by this bubblegum junk. It's just more musical kleenex; use it, then lose it. A huge letdown after the previous two albums; especially ""Under My Skin."" Check out Stefy's Orange Album for some good pop rock that you'll want to hold on to long after you've laid down your hard earned money."
2,Mediocre...,Mediocre material from a very talented artist. I dont understand why this album is so bad since the last two were pretty good. The very first review got it right. she has a long career ahead of her. Hopefully she gets the next one right.
1,THIS ITEM IS EDITED!,"I bought this CD from Amazon, and I just listened to it today. Much to my surprise, it was edited. I can not STAND edited CD's! It always sounds like the CD is skipping and it just ruins the whole song. Anyway, just a warning to everyone who feels the same way!"
1,Her lyrics are so annoying,"All of her songs sound the same.lyrically They all seem to be either about other chics(if she wasn't married i'd swear she was a lesbian),or about herself.She is so damn full of herself it's pathetc! She thinks she's the best damn thing!"
2,I liked her...but...,"I have the other two albums and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I was looking forward to this album and when I got it, I listened through it. Honestly, I think I found two songs I liked. The rest weren't that catchy or were lacking something. I found I didn't like the lyrics or the music and it didn't seem worth listening to. I give this album two stars though because I know she can do better and I like ""Keep Holding On"". Come on, Avril, try harder next time..."
2,Chinese Cantonese : Travel Talk,"The book's great, the cassette is crap. So I'll only tell you that what you learn on the cassette is a series of disconnected words or phrases, which will only help you if you have the precise problem with you hotel room as the speakers on the tape - otherwise, you're stuck."
5,numbers workbook,This book is really good for helping children recognize numbers and teach them the proper way to write them.
1,was not correct for my GPS Model - check application first,"I recommend the product if it is for your specific GPS!I purchased a Garmin GPS 76CSX, and Amazon said people who buy this product also buy, and all the also buys were for different model GPS's and did not work with that unite, so be careful when ordering."
5,Already a New York Times Best-Seller!,"Awesome book! Chock-full of great stories, prayers, and quotes. Has an excellent section of color photographs as well as a timeline of events. This is more than just a simple book on the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001. It is a keepsake, a reminder to all Americans who own this book, of what happened and our hope for the future. America Out of the Ashes has already hit the New York Times Best-Seller list within one week of its release!"
5,A must buy if you like Taj !,"If you are into Taj mahal and love his early albums from the 60 & 70's this is a must buy, every time i listen to this cd i like it even more. Two tracks from this cd are also on the other ""Music Makers cd "" Etta Baker with Taj Mahal"", tracks 1 & 2. The only downside of this cd is track 9, plus the last 2 tracks Taj does are incorrectly listed, trk 15 should be ""Take this Hammer"" and 16 should be ""Stagger Lee"""
