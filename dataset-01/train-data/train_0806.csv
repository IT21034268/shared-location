3,"Oh, please.....","The book was about a million times better than the movie. Although I have to say that the movie is well-pased, and the acting was good. I didn't think it was scary at all, except for the end when a bloody hand(Carrie's hand?) grabs Sue. I almost had a heart attack on that one.(There wasn't anything like that in the book!) And I read the other reviews that said that Mrs.White was scary, but she wasn't. The Mrs.White described in the book seems more scarier. For those who haven't watched the movie yet, take my advice and read the book first. It's a lot better."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though a fairly competant horror film, Carrie tones down the scale of Stephen King's horrific vision to its own detriment; additionally, Piper Laurie's hystrionics are more laughable than scary."
5,Carrie,"Stunning performances from an all-star cast (especially from Sissy Spacek as the sweet Carrie and Piper Laurie as he psychotic mother), a marvelously adapted script from the original novel, a beautiful music score and Brian De Palma's incredible visuals help to make this chilling film what it is: an absolutely terrifying classic of modern horror."
4,"""They're all going to laugh at you""","Infamous lines and first appearances of Hollywood stars are reasons to watch Carrie. I snagged my copy while Amazon had it on sale for under $5 and am really glad I picked it up. I am a fan of The Rage Carrie 2, The TNT Remake of Carrie and I can't wait for the Hollywood Remake with Julianne Moore as well. It is definitely worth a watch and a grab, especially if Amazon has it on sale for under $5~!"
4,sensitivity verses you know...,"Carrie White was under my bed and in my head in 76, and she's been a somewhay semi-permanent fixture ever since, though much less in the last few years.. For those who are fans of Carrie you'd know why. In my case Carrie's essential innocence and the loss of it at the hands of peer pressure/failure to conform, are key elements of the fragmentation of the most sensitive members of our society, the ones that are most vulnerable to persecution are they who are most likely to be targeted. We all know the end result for the effect of this Carrie and those around her, but in the real world this soulmurder commited on the 'ALTAR OF CONFORMITY' and it is shattering to the development of an integrated person."
5,great movie,the acting is so great in this movie i couldnt believe it.all of Stephen King's movies usually scare me except this one.but i heard yesterday that Stephen King didnt really write this or something.The mom was kinda scary but thats about it.that doesnt mean i didnt enjoy this video.if you liked welcome to the dollhouse and movies like that then this movie is for you
5,An absolute horror classic!,Carrie is one of the most enjoyable horrors around. The movie mixes terror with emotion in a way that ultimately keeps you gripped until the end. And the end finale is breath-taking. Excellent movie!
3,Carrie .. IS SO....,"This movie is still haunting me... I do not know why. Ok, i take that back... Yes I do know. First of all I relate to Carrie all too WELL. Except in the movie Carrie was never mean to anyone else, except in the end, and i don't think she meant harm to anyone, she just held her TEARS and RAGE in for so long - she just blew up (not herself everyone else) I have yet to see the 2nd Carrie, but if it were up to me to come up with a 3rd? I would have Carrie learn to play PIANO and DRUMS, and maybe throw in a Karaoke party/jam session instead of the prom...:) But that's just Me. P.S- one star is for all you who care one is for my dad(TOM) who has always been there for me and the third is for my mother Cindy who is nothing like margaret. And because my birth was like the end of the movie sort of the rest go to Dr. James Russell who helped me through it...oh yeah and Sarah McLachlan because she surfs!"
3,It was cool except......,"It was cool except in the end Carrie killed herself by taking her house down with her and her sick and demented mother.She definitly shouldn't have done that.That's being weak.People that commit suicide are weak.And I would've changed the movie just a little bit.I would've make it so the guy she went with to the prom was better looking and that people didn't laugh at her at the prom.People are not going to laugh at someone who gets pig blood dumped on them.No one at the prom would do that.They would be confused,sure;but they wouldn't laugh.And that gym teacher (i think her name mrs.white)was laughing at her,too.That's so unrealistic!"
4,A definite classic,"There's not much I can say for this movie that others haven't already. Sissy Spacek does well as Carrie, and while not all of the events of the movie match the book, this movie is indeed a decent adaptation of the book. Watching Carrie stalk forward in a psychotic, telekinesis-fueled rage is always a treat to watch. Two thumbs up!"
5,Essential Viewing,"In league with 'The Shining', 'Cujo', and so on. A 70s masterpiece in the horror genre. It is relentless in scary psychological undertones that play on the emotions, sympathy as much as terror and wonder. Sissy Spacek is dynomite. The filming is dynomite as well with touches of the 70s that you make you wonder how you survived this era. Truly creepy but a very interesting drama as well. Beauty and terror ride high in this feat by Brian DePalma - and the mind of Stephen King."
4,CARRIE,"I own this movie and all I have to say is that it is more of a drama than a horror motion picture.A teenaged girl is extremely tortured by her classmates at school and finally seeks revenge in the famed cinematic frenzy at her school prom.Sissy Spacek portrays Stephen King's depressing character. Nancy Allen plays the mean, make that almost evil bulliette, Piper Laurie plays Carrie's religous fanatic mother and Amy Irving plays the girl that is trying to help Carrie out..secretly.The acting is lovely, the filming/cinematography is excellent and, well, let's just say the entire film is lovely and delicate. The prom scene is pretty violent and this has a lot of nudity at the introduction."
4,A Classic !!,"Well, I just read that MGM is issuing a special editon of this DVD. I hope they improve the sound as the sound of the first DVD is lame. Its 1999 sequel (The Rage Carrie 2) has a super Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. Anyway this DVD's picture quality is good. Bright and sharp. You won't notice this is a 1976 movie. You should know the story by now. About a nerdy high school student played by Sissy Spacek who has telekinetic power. And things turn deadly as the other students make fun on her during prom night. John Travolta, Nancy allen and Amy Irving Co star. Brian De Palma reunited Travolta and Allen 3 years later in Blow out that is coming soon on DVD as well."
5,GREAT HORROR MOVIE...,"THIS IS A GREAT HORROR MOVIE, SISSY SPACEK AS A SHY, TIMID CARRIE IS GREAT. YOU FEEL SORRY FOR HER THRU THE WHOLE MOVIE, AND SHE GETS HER REVENGE IN THE END. HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A WOMEN SCORNED IS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. HER RELIGIOUS FREAK OF A MOTHER IS GREAT. SHE THINKS BECAUSE HER CARRIE'S FATHER RAPED HER WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER AND THE POWER CARRIE HAS IS A SIN AND SHE GOES OVERBOARD REPENTING AND MAKES CARRIE PRAY WITH HER. AMY IRVING IS EXCELLENT IN THIS MOVIE, SHE TRIES TO BE A FRIEND TO CARRIE WITHOUT LETTING HER POPULAR FRIENDS KNOWING IT. THE ENDING IS GREAT AND WILL SCARE THE HELL OUT OF YOU. THIS MOVIE IS WELL MADE AND THE CAST IS SUPERB. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE."
2,"ok, if i have to.....","Carrie was NOT scary, once again stephen Kings novel was better than this movie. I only enjoyed the ending wen the pigs blood was poured on her, because it was the only good and funny part of the whole movie, my advise is to see the remake...its way better. *~SMG FAN~*"
1,in was gross and dumb,it was ok it was a little sickning and gross the book was better cause you couldn't see what was happening.
2,*NOT* HD,"This is a very good movie; 4 1/2 stars, I reckon. However, though we ordered it in HD, it streamed in SD. We wanted to watch the movie right then, so we went ahead with it rather than complaining. So caveat emptor about whether Amazon HD streams are actually HD."
4,"Carrie, more than just words","Carrie is the first adaption from Stephen King's novel, which is done by Brian de Palma. For such a classic as Carrie which has been released in 1976 this movie is still timeless for watching. Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a telekinetic girl and she moves things with her mind. She's an ugly girl as the movie wants to tell you. Everyone is making fun at her....UNTIL THE BLOOD'S FALLIN'.... ""They are all going to laugh at you"".. Carrie, one of the scariest all-time classics with: Sissy Spacek, Piper Lauri, Amy Irving and John Travolta."

4,If You Haven't Seen The Movie And You Don't Want To Know What Happens Then Don't Read This,"Carrie is considered a horror movie. Well, personally, I didn't find it all that scary and I'm only twelve. From the beginning scene in the shower room (they're so mean!)until the crowning of the prom King and Queen, you keep wondering (or at least i did) what is going to set Carrie off, because all of these people are really mean to her, including her mother, and she still doesn't do anything really bad with her power of telekinesis. The dumping of the pig's blood kind of creeped me out. I mean, that's just wrong. The only parts that I found creepy were Carrie's eyes during the evil part of the gym scene, and the part where all the knives fly into her mother. The very end would have made me jump a foot if I hadn't seen that part once before on T.V. The acting was amazing, particularly by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. This is a very good, suspenseful movie."
5,OUTSTANDING,I've recently seen the later TV film incarnation of Carrie.It doesn't compare to this 1976 theatrical adaptation.All actors in this film are outstanding.Including Betty Buckley as the girls Phys Ed coach Miss Collins.A perfect horror flick for it's time.
5,the best stephen king movie i have ever seen in my life!,i give carrie 5 stars because sissy spacek (carrie) looks like my mother! a lot! the only part i dont like in the movie is at the begining when carrie gets her peried! and the other reason why i am giveing it 5 stars is because it has a great story behind it! i have rented it a thousand times and i enjoy it thats why i give it 5 stars!!!!! sincerley undera fisher.
3,half as good as the book,"I adore Stephen King's Carrie. The book is an excellent horror story as well as a harrowing look at bullying and adolescence. It even predicted school shootings.The film has none of these qualities (except for the school shootings prediction, of course). Brian de Palma's screen version eclipses most of what makes the book so good--the fragmentary style of panicked thoughts, the town-wide rampage after the prom, the telepathic connection between Carrie and Sue, etc.The saving grace is that Sissy Spacek gives a strong performance, but Piper Laurie is terrifying. Such a tour-de-force performance in an otherwise disposable film. I look forward to Kimberly Pierce's (Boys Don't Cry) remake, and I rarely look forward to remakes. If you've never seen this version, read the book first."
5,Great,"Still one of my favorite movies. The Blu-ray looks better than the old DVD. In this time of CGI everything, the movie still holds up."
3,Can a horror movie also be a good revenge movie?,I think many a teenager has seen this original version of Stephen Kings Carrie and which they had those mental powers that Carrie does.A classic movie that does not focus on the gore and one of John Travolta's early appearances.I think the most horrifying thing in this movie though is Carrie's over the top religious mother.
5,Stephen Kings first,Sissy Spacek is great in this movie. You can feel her pain. Her mother is a nut. And the kids hate her. Bad idea. She gets even. With all of them.
4,Great terror flick,"I watched this movie back when I was young but, now when I watch these old movies on DVD it's like watching them for the first time. They are in their true form. Well, most of them. So, it was really like the first time watching this flick and it scared the [heck] out of me at the end. Some moments are very tender and uplifting like when Carrie is at the dance with her date and he really wants to be kind to her not cruel. But then, everybody dies and it is basically just horror and it is very sad for Carrie. I love all the new restored DVD's out there like this one and I highly recommend it. The clear sharp picture and great soundtrack in hi-fi stereo sent chills up my spine."
4,carrie is a great movie,the movie carrie is a very good movie and it is also a very sad movie. Carrie is about a girl who no one likes and she discovers that she these powers and she kills every one at the end
5,Horror Classic,"If you are a Stephen King fan, this is a must have! It will definately keep your attention! I would not recommend that you let children under 13 watch it. The first time I saw it ,many moons ago, I had a few nightmares about it. the hand coming up out of the grave at the end scared the begeebers out of me!"
4,"explosive, righteous climax","Perhaps the best King horror movie, with an explosive, righteous climax anyone who ever felt like an out-cast will fully relish. Check out the tense swirling prom dance, John Travolta as a meanie, and Brian De Palma's show-stopping camera gymnastics. Sissy Spacek won an Oscar nomination as the tormented telekinetic."
4,"explosive, righteous climax","Perhaps the best King horror movie, with an explosive, righteous climax anyone who ever felt like an out-cast will fully relish. Check out the tense swirling prom dance, John Travolta as a meanie, and Brian De Palma's show-stopping camera gymnastics. Sissy Spacek won an Oscar nomination as the tormented telekinitic."
5,It's a Classic,Carrie was a Greatttt movie. Sissy Spacek made a perfect nerd. The settings and lighting made the effect of terror sooo real.
3,Great Movie but Lousy Blu-ray Transfer,"If you enjoy this film as much as I do, I have bad news: The Blu-ray transfer is mediocre at best. Scenes are soft and often grainy, lacking any of the real clarity high def can bring. Sound also doesn't really benefit; it's slightly sharper but that's about it. Unless you don't already own the film, stick with the regular DVD. The upgrade, even at such a low price, isn't really worth it."
2,Very Brief,"This video is very brief and they want you to buy more videos to show the pre-flight, and setup take down."
3,It's alright.,"I just had the chance to check this video out and it was pretty short, my ultralight just cannot seem to handle making it off the ground whatsoever. Every time I attempt to launch, I end up steering directly towards my university (Eastern Washington University), I think it's broken but the video offers no information as how to maintain your air ready vehicle.For an even better instructional video on the subject matter, check out the following link:[...]Thanks,Eric"
5,Great work Cobras!,"Jason was a fellow company commander in 3ID. He does a great job of describing today's battlefield at company level and below. This is a must read for any soldier, NCO, or junior officer preparing to deploy to Iraq and fight."
5,Joshua Keena,"Heavy Metal is an outstanding and insightful glimpse of the innerworkings of an armor company training and going to war. The authors' dedication to put the soldiers at the forefront of the story truly shows. For this reason, Heavy Metal succeeds at clearly illustrating the bravery, tenacity, and creativity of the armor warriors that fought during the famed Thunder Runs into Baghdad.Considering the conditions that the authors endured and the short time involved getting this fine work to print, Heavy Metal is an indespensible reference for the combat operations that shaped the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This book will not only make you proud of the soldiers that fought through tremendous uncertainty and harsh conditions, it also illustrates how armor (tanks) can be used in future operations."
3,More of an overview than the details.,"Good book. I was looking for another ""Thunder Run"" by David Zucchino, which is more of a blow-by-blow account of the Baghdad armored invasion.This book covers the same material but from the perspective of a higher level commander on the ground. Not quite as much detail about the fighting (which I am more interested in). Still a good read."
5,True and scary!,"I gave this book 5 stars not because ""I loved it!"" but because it opened my eyes to the underworld of the flesh trade. When going through life and then having something so abusive and horrible revealed to you... it's like having a door opened and stuffed within the dank closet are mutilated corpses. You take a second look or run. Your view has been changed... forever. And even though the mutilated part is a made-up example... the information in this book is real. That's damn scary. So I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about this global crime industry and/or who want to get involved to help these victims escape the clutches of pimps and the slave trade industry... and it is a massive industry.The information is older but relevant. If anything this has only gotten worse across the planet."
5,Great Game,"My daughter got this game for Christmas and we all love it. It is a fun, educational game that the whole family enjoys! My daugther is 6 and my son is 9 and they both enjoy it! Highly recommended."
5,A Beatle Fan must!,"If you're the type who reads Beatle books and likes the backstory on all the principle characters, you'll love this biography. Just remember, it's about George Martin, not the Beatles, so there's lots of autobiographical info about his life that has nothing to do with the fab four. Fascinating and interesting to the Beatle nation, probably less so to rest, but why would any of them even be looking at this film?"
2,Informative,"This George Martin DVD was very slow moving, but interesting. I was able to get two naps in during this video. It did not go into as much detail with the Beatles as I had hoped for. It was also difficult to understand alot of the British dialect even with captions. I cannot tell you to run right out and buy this one like I did."
1,Bad DVD with Misleading Title,"""Produced by George Martin"" is false advertising. It should really be called ""Giles Martin's Home Movie of George Martin's Career"". When I bought this DVD, I thought I was gonna get an insight to producing by George Martin, especially with all the subjects that were part of the DVD like Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr. I thought it was going to be similar to Geoff Emerick's book on engineering at Abbey Road entitledHere, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles.Instead what I got was a ""This Is Your Life"" style home movie that George probably ok'd to give his son a producing credit.It's a shame that such a brilliant man of 85 is not doing more to protect and enhance his legacy.Do NOT buy this DVD. It's an utter waster of time!"
4,Very interesting for Beatle nerds and music producer geeks,"I have always thought George Martin was a genius, and was undeniably the ""fifth Beatle."" There really would have been no Beatles as we know them if it hadn't been for the masterwork production of George Martin. This documentary gives us more insight into who he was and how he did it. Very cool!"
3,why?,"I bought this book to advance my skill level. I feel like I bought a book with minimal instruction, and lots of pictures of pretty cakes. Not one of my best purchases."
5,well decorated,Book was suggested from my sister. Great investment for people wanting to learn the art of cake decorating. easy step by step instruction with recipe for cakes and icing that are well to work with.
5,The Best Cake Decorating Book Ever!!!,"I have been doing cake decorating for about 35 years. My first venture into the world of cakes began with a castle cake that I just had to create for my son's first birthday. I found a frosting that was called Royal Icing, sounded impressive enough for MY son. Not bothering to read too much about the final product I made & covered his cake entirely out of this Royal Icing, nice & thick too. The party centered around the guests trying to chisel out enough chocolate cake to taste this divine creation. Over the years I have learned so much more from a few classes nad from Wilton cake books.However I LEARNED MORE IN 20 MINUTES OF READING Ms Toba Garrett's ""THE WELL DECORATED CAKE"" THEN I HAVE LEARNED IN 30 YEARS OF DECORATING. SHE IS JUST THE BEST. AND I WOULD LOVE TO STUDY UNDER HER GUIDANCE"
5,Wonderful book,"I've had a couple of basic Wilton cake decorating classes at our local craft shop, and have been making cakes for friends and family for years, but not professionally. I considered making my daughter's wedding cake and so checked out dozens of cake decorating books from our library system. This book was so good that I didn't want to take it back. Even though I decided I wouldn't have time to do the wedding cake, I loved this book so much that I had to buy one for myself."
2,Disappointed,Good price on this book and I'll keep it for the buttercream recipes. Ms. Garrett's work is technically amazing--she is an artist--but the designs are are too precious and fussy looking for my tastes. More 18th century than 21st.
2,Very 1980s decorating designs :(,"I was very excited when I ordered this book due to the high reviews. I was very disappointed when it arrived. The cake decorting designs are very old fashioned...like maybe from the 1980s. Nothing that I would use to decorate my cakes. It does come with alot of recipes, which I used the lemon curd one. It tasted really good. All in all if I had to do it again I would not have ordered this cake decorating book."
3,complicated,"The book is fantastic when it comes to instruction, but i was disappointed in that all the recipes are given in meter measurments. Not being that great in math, I found it highly frustrating having to transfer every measurement into English measures. Otherwise, they have some great ideas and beautiful work that is not that hard to master."
1,POS - didn't last a month,This thing is extremely fragile. It broke down the seam a month after I purchased it.
3,HTC 8525 Charger charges! ..... just not very fast.,"Works as advertised. Charger fits my old Cingular 8525 just fine, but the poor thing just doesn't want to move much juice. Useful for keeping a dying phone alive on the road, but you'll want a wall plug for any semblance of progress when charging."
2,Doesn't work consistently,"This product works well with my bluetooth headset, but works only intermittently with my 8525. Most often when I plug it into my phone, the phone lights up as though it knows it's plugged in, but it doesn't charge. I think the charger is not delivering the right amount of current to the phone, but must be for the headset.I bought two of these, so I know it wasn't just one that's a fluke. And I know it's not the phone, because every other USB-plug charger I use works like a champ. I guess for a penny I can't really complain. It's just frustrating because even the one from the AT&T; store was junk too, and that one cost $30!"
1,Good thing it wasn't too expensive.,My husband lost his car charger so I ordered him this one. It takes FOREVER to charge his phone. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,Good guide for Final Cut Express,"The introduction states that it's not a book for beginners. The author spends a good amount of pages explaining the behind-the-scenes mechanics of the program and efficient ways to manage your projects. It give you guidance on how Final Cut Express deals with files, how it structures projects, and what you can expect out of your system.There are clear instructions about doing voice-overs, importing files and music, and all the different tools in Final Cut Express.My one gripe is that there isn't a glossary of terms that explains when you might want to use a ""slip edit"", a ""roll edit"", or the others. I had to figure it all out by trial and error. I suspect that the terms used are common to editors and anyone who's been to film school, but I don't fall into either category.Thankfully, it's not a book for rank beginners as it covers the software in enough depth such that I'm sure I'll refer to it for many film projects to come."
5,Visual Quickstart Guide,"I have used several books (Adobe Premiere 5 & 6 and Adobe Photoshop 7) from this publisher and I came to the conclusion that these are not instruction or how-to books. They work best for reference. Their structure is not first step, next, next then final step; more like here is how to do ___. Here is how to do ___."
1,This book is all over the place without bad focus,"Don't waste the money this book is all over the place. One would have to thumb constantly back and forth to find information, every example starts you from the beginning, material is extremely redundant. And to add insult to injury where it is redundant different verb-age is used making you question what you have read in previous chapters, thus making you go back and double check what you have already read. Book also wastes a lot of space in pictures instead of straight forward instruction, many pages are wasted only showing one step of example, space waster. Case in-point, go to index and look up Transition, creating, not there, author runs on about editors and doesn't focus on getting to work immediately. I can't believe someone has taken an Apple product, something that's meant to be easy and simple to use, and created such a confusing guide to it."
4,What is 'the fraser' talking about..?,"This book does explain terms like ""slip edit"" and ""roll edit"". Maybe not in a separate glossary, but right where they are used which to me is more useful. If that's the only gripe, you don't have a gripe"
2,Avoid this book.,"Usually Peach Pit Press is good for the money, however, thisseries on FCP is NOT useful. It's so NOT useful, I would feel it incorrect to re-sell it. I see a trash fire in my future. : )"
3,Not a bad book,"If you're bored and need something to read, this is a decent book. The lack of 5 stars isn't on the author's writing ability - she has a fluid style and pays attention to detail and keeps things interesting.But the title is misleading. There are no gods or goddesses here. The series is misnamed - no one is a goddess, not even Persephone. Overall this was a good story, but don't expect a tale of goddesses here, because you will not find any.Also, there's not a lot of romance in here. Hades and Persephone grow closer, but not much attention is given to the courtship. So as this book is lacking in gods and goddesses, it's also lacking in romance. This book serves better as a light read, or a novel for young adults. Don't expect any more, and you won't be disappointed."
2,Beware Political Rantings,"I enjoyed parts of this book; however, there were several sections which I felt had nothing to do with the ""back-to-the-land"" premise. Do I really have to wade through the diatribes against George W Bush? I thought the book would have been more effective if it stuck to the initial ideas of self-sufficiency. Then it would have reached a larger audience. I could not read the whole thing due to these rabbit trails.I found the book _On Good Land_ by Michael Ableman to be much more helpful, or even _It's a Long Road to a Tomato_ by Keith Stewart. Back-to-the-land views are held by many across the political spectrum, as we are all called to be good stewards of this good earth."
3,Enjoyable book,"I enjoy reading books about changing to a simpler life..this one was no exception. It's inspiring when people walk away from good paying corporate jobs in search of happiness (and find it without ending up on the sidewalk begging for money). I wish I had the guts to do it. Although I have no interest in running a bed&breakfast it is interesting to hear what that is like and how many people get burnt out after a few years of it. The book did have references to related books, websites, etc throughout which I found helpful. Overall I wouldn't call the book earth shattering, but I'm glad I read it."
4,music for life!,this is my favorite cerrone compilation. Still haunting and powerful. Defines the era of disco. Je Suis Music and Music of Life were ahead of their time.
5,Outstanding - A must own!,"Fun for all ages! You can gaurantee laughter as everyone tries to recall famous movie lines, songs, nusery ryhmes & etc... You will find yourself singing entire songs to get to the correct line.Can wait for the second edition of cards!"
3,Could've been better,"I enjoyed doing this project with my son, but half of the paint containers had dried up paint in them. We were very limited. I made the most of it for my son."
1,George Foreman Suit Separate Pant Grey Stripe,These pants are an excellent fit and look very nice. I have had difficulty since putting on weight in finding slacks that look as well as feel good. These have suited me perfectly. I would recommend them. I also bought the black stripe in the same style.Douglas Tallant
4,Secrets can kill,This book is a must read! Nancy goes to a highschool whereshe meets a hunk!But she later finds out that he's a spy.Read this to find out what happends!
2,Nancy Drew...where are you?,"Anyone who has read the orginal Nancy Drew mysteries will be disappointed by this novel. This ""Barbie"" doll version of the our favourite detective is more focused on her appearance, boys, and partying than solving the case or helping others. Personally, I DO NOT want my children reading this novel and would prefer them to become familiar with the old Nancy...an inspirational and intelligent woman not the materialistic, immature, self-conscious clothes horse featured in this novel."
4,Nancy's on the case!,"When Nancy's asked to look into some theft in Bedford High School, she thinks it'll a piece of cake. She should have known better. She's working undercover as a student, and supposedly only the principal and her contact, the incredibly gorgeous class president, Daryl Gray know who she really is. Someone sends her a video tape of herself, ending it with a warning to stay away from Bedford. Of course this makes Nancy more determined, but how could anyone know she's a detective? She has to start finding answers fast because suddenly her prime suspect is dead, pushed down a flight of stairs in the school. And then there's Daryl, who makes Nancy forget about Ned, her longtime boyfriend. And on top of that she finds another video tape which changes everything and her perspective on the students in Bedford.... Keep writing these books, Carolyn Keene, there's loads of us out there who love these mysteries!"
5,secrets,"Secrets can kill is an action filled book that takes place in a high school full of rumors, lies, and funeral services. Everyone is hiding something, but someone wants Nancy off the case. This high action adventure will have you at the edge of your seat. Any one will enjoy this high pact action adventure mystery."
4,"If you want horrific thrills,then you're holding the right b","She's on the case and it's all going well until the primesuspect on her list takes the plunge off right off, when he dies.Nancy Drew the amazingly- gorgeous- crime- fighting- teenagedetective has taken up another disguise. This time she is astudent at Bedford High. The case looks like a breeze, plus she'sunfortunately stuck with a maigor hunk as her contact.Well Ned,her boyfriend back home doesn't have to know aboutthis little rendeivous,but maybe Nancy is starting to sink,can she really trust any of them after seeing the evidenceshe finds?You decide!"
5,Carolyn Keen has done it again!!,"Nancy goes undercover to crack a high school theft case..Sinister secrets lie undercover at a seemingly safe school. Nancy finds herself strongly attracted to her contact, but is that the most dangerous thing of all.....A strong book with a great storyline that keeps you turning page after page for more!!"
1,Very very expensive,You are far better off not to buy the printer that uses this wax. It is expensive and a great deal is wasted ever time the printer is turned off and on.
5,Great Watch,"This is a great watch. I've owned Seiko watches for 35 years and without exception they all performed to the max. I still have my original chronograph that I bought 35 years ago and it still keeps great time. The new SNM035 is no exception. It's a heavy duty watch, very functional, easy to read dial in daylight or dark. You would have to be really creative to come up with punishment to stop this watch. I've also received a lot of compliments on its clean looks."
2,looks nice on paper,"The watch is beautiful, and I found it to be accurate. There are many negatives that I personally have: IT IS HEAVY, if you like or need large size and heft then this is for you. I chose this watch for the ease of reading, for it's water resistance (screw-down crown and all)and the expandable watch band. The biggest problem with the watch is the band: is is, to me, a really poor design that not only looks funny when extended but I question it's integrity. The size, both diameter and thickness attracts a lot of attention with some people saying the word ""gaudy"" and ""huge""."
4,Great compass,I bought this compass because I recently joined a Search & Rescue team and we need something that works when GPS fails. It has all of the basic features you would want. It is easy to read and easy to adjust. The size is nice and works well either in your hand or on a map. The only quibble I have is that they do not provide instructions on how to properly fasten the lanyard onto it. I also felt that the lanyard itself looked a bit flimsy - we will see how it is holding up in a few months...
5,"Accurate compass,easy to read & easy declination adjustment","I initially bought a version of this compass without a mirror. It is a good compass, but I decided it would be easier and more accurate to read if I had bought the version (Suunto MC-2DLIN Compass) with the mirror. I like this mirrored version so well that I bought another just like it as a back-up. This compass is easy to get a reading using the mirror. The scales provided on the see-thru base are nice and adjusting for declination is very easy; just flip the compass over and using the supplied tool, make a slight adjustment (East or West, as apprpriate) and then you are true North! I had to adjust for 7 1/2 degrees West declination and it was easy to do."
5,Great tool,"What a great compass- it's been very tough and endured a beating in the field, with no breaks of the plastic or fading of the numbers. My bearings also generally sync up with those of others around me, so I feel confident my compass works well."
4,"Hard to control, but still fun","It is really hard to control the shoes, to get them to go the direction you want. Nonetheless, my 8 year old son and I are having a blast with this. Recommended. Little cones that they give for goals are useless, we just make our own goals. Enjoy"
3,Colostrum Review,"I took colostrum to help boost my immune system to keep me from having chronic ear infections/sinus infections. I would take two pills in the morning and two at night.This stuff works. I haven't had an ear infection/sinus infection since I started taking colostrum.The only problem that I have is that the colostrum has made me VERY depressed. I am usually full of energy and optimistic. This stuff has brought me down a lot. I feel very apathetic. It is making me worry about bizarre things.I may have to only take colostrum when I feel like i'm getting sick...because I just can't deal with the depression.It seems odd to me that it would make you depressed. Colostrum is supposed to have anti-inflammatory effects, which can actually REDUCE depression.If anyone has any ideas about why it would make me depressed (taking 4 capsules daily), PLEASE leave a comment. I would love to hear your thoughts on the subject."
3,"well, at least its not superjoint...","Having fallin in love with NOLA, I was extremely excited about another DOWN album. But, this album just didn't live up to par. Although the album is a good album, it is nowhere hear the caliber of NOLA. If you were hoping for another NOLA, just keep hoping, cuz this aint it. BUT...this album is still a good ablum. If I had never known about NOLA, I would say taht this album is extremely entertaning and sound worthy, but no comparison to the last. Buy this CD becuase it is good, but not because it is DOWN."
5,Modern Day Black Sabbath,"When you buy this album, and you should because it kicks more ass than Wahoo Mcdaniels, pick up their first one as well, NOLA. Long live the Brotherhood!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Reminds me of Pantera's ""The Great Southern Trendkill""","And that CD was amazing. I find most of Phil Anselmo's side projects sound very similar to that era in Panrera. This CD is great, but it gets 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed NOLA more. Highly recommended."
4,HM where it should be today!,"This has to be the BEST heavy metal CD I have heard in years. I was wondering where HM was going, with all the rap-metal going on, along with the general attitude that metal will no longer sound like it did in the 80's (forgive me!), I was a bit lost.I 'tried' all the nu and rap metal bands, but they still kind of left me cold as far as the general 'feeling' I used to get from all that great mindless, party-oriented stuff from the 80's. OK, time to get with the program - so I have, and have found that DOWN is where it is at. The sum of their parts shine like the sun, as any of their individual parts have not been that hot over the past 5 years...(Pantera, COC, etc). As some reviews say, guys you got to quit the day jobs and do more DOWN!This is one awesome CD. I have not heard DOWN's first CD, but if this is a disappointment, well the first must be a classic. Either way, check this CD out - it will grow on you quickly."
2,Down II -- Very Average,"*NOLA was one of the most amzing CD's I ever bought so I eagerly awaited the release of DOWN II. . .If I had to pick a personal Top 10 CD's of all time NOLA would be in it . . .It is with great sadness that I inform you that (at least to my tastes) DOWN II is a very average CD.About 1/3 of it is slow/accousticy stuff or experimental (like a song with only drums).One of these songs (My Mistake - I think its called) is pretty good. . .The other 2/3's of the CD is heavier, but I found it uninspiring with about 3 (from 10) of the heavier songs appealing to me.I must say we all have our own taste for music and you might really like this CD,but for me (after how good the first was) this is a real let DOWN==="
2,disappointing,"I expected more as the singer is from one of the heaviest bands ever known. Decentish, but I wasn't very pleased."
1,a HUGE disappointment,"I love NOLA. You can tell these guys were just doing what they loved in it just happened to become an album. It just has that feel. Like everything just feel into place without having to work at it. Its a pure rock album.Down II is not like that. It seems like they tried hard to get that same groove, that southern rock feel. I really tried to like this album...and it has some decent guitar, lyrics, and beats. But in this case the whole is not the sum of its parts, it just doesn't come together. It feels about as real as a brittany spears album, and it pains me to say that."
5,DOWN AGAIN!!!!!,"After NOLA, DOWN recorded this great METAL album A BUSTLE IN YOUR HEDGEROW!!!! It's different from the brutal METAL assault of NOLA...It's more in a HEAVY ROCK atmosphere, with some nice acoustic songs like LEARN FROM THIS MISTAKE, WHERE I'M GOING and LIES I DON`T KNOW WHAT THEY SAY BUT....Also some amazing HEAVY tunes like THERE'S SOMETHING ON MY SIDE, THE MAN THAT FOLLOWS HELL and GHOSTS ALONG THE MISSISSIPI!!!!! DOWN II is AMAZING like NOLA!!!! and it's way different from PANTERA...it's really a new band...and a GREAT BAND!!!!REALLY AMAZING!!!!! WELL DONE, DOWN!!!!! BRAVO!!!!"
4,Very good metal album,This is a very very good metal album and im sure that if you like Motorhead (As i do) then you will probably like this album too. The melodies are very good and there is a high energy feeling. A very good album to make your adrenaline rush.
4,Very Good,"There is a lot of really strong material on here, it may not be as good as ""Nola"" but you can't deny this one. ""Ghost Along the Mississippi"" has one of the coolest opening riffs ever. ""Landing on the Mountains of Meggido"" is a quiet and haunting piece. ""Beautifully Depressed"" may just be the real gem on here. There is some filler and I think because the album has such a long running time that some extra material could have been left off. Don't expect ""Nola"", this is it's own album. I was however highly pleased with this purchase."
3,not as good as the first DOWN,"I was so excited when I heard that a new Down was coming out, however, that excitement set me up for a letdown. The album is good, it has the heavy sabbath-esque riffs you expect, and Phil is a good metal vocalist. Its just that nothing really blew me away like the first Down. In fact, I found myself getting bored with it after a while. There are decent songs on here, just not enough of them stand out. It is worth owning for Down fans, however, don't expect it to blow the NOLA release away."
2,First one was way better,"I think Nola is one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever and I too was anticipating the next album. I wish they waited 7 years more because this one was really disappointing. First off, the production really [stinks] compared to the first one. Someone said in one of the reviews that the drums were too loud. I disagree, I think they weren't loud enough! The other person probably had that opinion because the guitars sounded bad as well. Vocals weren't as great either. The production wouldn't have been much of an issue if the songs were better as well.Who knows I remember that I didn't like the first one when I first heard it either. Maybe in time it will grow on me. I've only listened to it twice since I got it (like two months ago). I hope the next one is better and doesn't take so long to put out.Side note: I saw them live just last week and they did rock although Phil Anselimo was zonked out of his mind. I wish he could have been sober but they were still great."
3,Not Nola Part 2,"Why are the back up vocals overdubbing phil on phil while pepper is a great singer. Plus the first album had a much more bluesy, southern rock style that I think made it great. This album is for the most part dark and gloomy and depressing. Hell, darkness and pain are all played out metal themes. Nola could be put in from beginning to end but I guess that was a different time and I was a different person."
4,Overall quite good...,"For those of you expecting extreme thrash metal from the lead singer of Pantera, you will be disappointed. While there are some riffs that are similar to those from Pantera, Black Sabbath is a much clearer and driving influence (for example the opening riff on track 1). Overall, this album is worth the money as there are some high quality songs on it. However, it isn't as good as Nola but then again, how many are?"
5,PERFECTION OF THE SEED,One helluva CD.. i have a booklet of my favorite CD's.. this CD is right along with NOLA and all the Pantera CD's.. it rules.. Ghosts Along The Mississippi is my favorite song on there.. Beautifully Depressed is another great song.. an instant classic.
4,An album for any mood,"I have never really wanted to write a review, but I just wanted to say how much I really liked this album. One song in paticular has me obsessed. ""Lies, I Don't Know What They Say But..."" is utterly entrancing. I feel as though this is Phil best song on the CD. Pepper and Rex play perfectly together. I just can't say enough good things about this CD. You can't peg it as a Pantera or COC or any of the other members other bands. It's just Down."
5,Waitin' For You,"I have kept his 8 track version of this album until December 2008. Do you know how long that has been? This was a wonderful holiday to find Richard's album in CD form, finally! He's wonderful."
5,cute little wushu flick...,definitely worth a watch and chuckle. don't expect anything hardcore like fearless or hero. jet li stars as wong fei hung and he takes cares of this little town's troubles.
3,"Ok movies, but not like the books","These are all quite good movies. However, only The Hunt for Red October is anywhere like the book. I was disappointed in both Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger as the movies were quite unfaithful to the books. (I recall that at the time Tom Clancy wasn't impressed either.) I had a hard time buying Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan as he seemed too old for the part. Any fan of the Jack Ryan series of books will know what I mean.Nevertheless, all are quite entertaining movies with lots of suspense and action. Viewers who haven't read the books will thoroughly enjoy them all."
4,Alone: Ballads for Solo Piano,"This is exactly what one would expect for straight ahead jazz piano but seems hard to find. As advertised it is only solo piano w/ no performance gimmicks - this may sound a little Spartan to some, but if you appreciate great piano playing and love jazz this is it! I have played it dozens of times since receiving the disk in mid December a few weeks ago and am not tired of it. This CD will be on my disk changer for a good portion of the new year."
5,Peaceful Piano,This is a very relaxing and enjoyable CD. It feels like he is playing in my living room. I love the song selections and improvisation. Great for jazz lovers and piano lovers.
1,Partially our fault,We are not big movie buyers so we were unaware of what Region 2 means. We can't even use it!
4,THE SCOTTISH BRIDE,"THE SCOTTISH BRIDE, a good book, starts off with noticable verbiage, so much that it is distracting. Then, as the story develops, the writing style modifies and the novel becomes believable and intense.Tysen Sherbrook, Englishman, widower, and ""man-of-God"" inherits a Sottish title and castle. He, along with his precocious daughter, go to Scotland to investigate his new holdings. There the Sherbrookes meet the beautiful Mary Rose Fordyce and learn of her travail, i.e., her birth circumstance, her predator, and her inheritance. From this point on, there is much romance and adventure.THE SCOTTISH BRIDE delves into the foolishness of prejudice and the immense pain it causes. It also looks at the healing forces of family and love."
4,Love the Sherbrookes,"I just had to express my pleasure with this book. I am one who loved the other three books in this series. I am an avid romance reader. But these books are truly my favorites. This family is wonderful. Also, by bringing in Douglas and Alex, Ryder and Sophie and my favorite Sinjin and Colin was fabulous.I hope that everyone that read any of the others continues with this one.I truly hope Ms. Coulter writes more about this incredible family."
1,Doesn't measure up...,"I'm a great fan of C. Coulter and was looking forward to reading the 4th installment of the brides series. What a disappointment! The repetitive thought process for each character over one incident got to be monotonous. It seemed like she used this form of writing throughout the book just to fill pages. I finished the book in great hopes of it improving, which it never did. Save your money and don't waste your time...read something else."
3,"Average, at best...","I was so looking forward to reading the last in the BRIDES series, The Scottish Bride. I especially enjoyed the first and third Bride books (about Douglas and Alex & Colin and Sinjun). This book was in my opinion, just dull. It had nothing to do with his being a vicar. It was, as another reviewer put it, very difficult to ""connect"" to the characters Mary Rose or Tysen. I just did not come away feeling like I knew them at all, her other BRIDE books were much, much better. I read on the back cover of this book that Miss Coulter said this was her favorite book in the BRIDE series. I guess she is seeing something which I am not! I recommend the other BRIDE books by this author as well as anything by Lisa Kleypas, Julia London, Julia Quinn and Kat Martin."
2,A Disapointing Finale to the Bride Series,"I want to start by confessing that I really wanted to like this book. I loved the Bride series, and I was thrilled to discover that Coulter had writtn a book about Tyson. At the same time, I had apprehensions about what type of character the sanctimonius and pious younger brother would turn out to be. My worries were not allayed by further reading, Tyson has changed since the earlier books but his character was too loosely drawn in this book. I did not find any of the other characters in this book interesting, nor was the mystery very intriguing. In summary, Coulter should have quit while she was ahead."
3,i read all the other books in the series,I read all three of the regency series and loved them when i heard about the scottish bride i was excited to go and read it. However when i started the book it wasn't exciting i kept on reading the book thinking it had to get better.The chracters never stood up for themselves and it seemed almost that they were letting things happen to them.I haven't even finished the book and am considering putting it the shelf. This is not one of the best catherine coulter's i have ever read and i love reading her books.
1,ONE OF COULTER'S WORST,"This was the second Catherine Coulter I read and I nearly gave up on her. The book was poorly written compared to her usual standard and after reading a number of her other books, I began to wonder if the same person wrote Scottish Bride! I'd only recommend this book if you are stuck in a waiting room somewhere with no other reading available."
2,"Learn to say ""when""!","As another reviewer mentioned, this book is TOO LONG. It should have finished once Mary Rose & Tysen got married. And the ""plot"" involving Erickson MacPhail--a very low-rent affair. There was no real danger, and no real evil, just a bungled kidnapping by a very misguided idiot.It almost seemed as if Coulter didn't devote 100% attention to this novel-- the characters were pretty much cardboard cut-outs. I didn't get much sense of them being ""real."" And after a while Meggie wasn't ""cute and amusing"" anymore, she was just plain annoying.I haven't read any other of the Sherbrooke books, but I'm glad to hear they're better than this one. Considering Coulter's status as a writer, they'd almost have to be!"
1,MOLASSES IN WINTER,"SIMPLY PUT, WORDS FAIL ME AS I STRIVE TO PURVEY THE SENSE OF FLOW I GET FROM THIS BOOK; AKIND TO MOLASSES IN THE WINTER.A BIT MORE HEAT TO THE MIX WOULD HAVE WET MY PALATE FOR THIS MUDANE LITERARY EXPERIENC."
4,I'm reading this series backward...,"A friend bought me this book, so I wasn't aware it was a series. I was glad to know there are more of the ""intriguing"" characters to be read about and look forward to that. This story had a great many FUN moments, and a couple of tiresome happenings. However, for the most part it was enjoyable. I would have liked to have read more about the Scottish aspect, rather than the English lord, who deigned to ""fall-in-love"" with a Scottish lass."
2,Put this Bride Back on the shelf,"I loved the original book ""The Sherbrooke Bride"". I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse. The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters. Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time. If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass. Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so. I would then read Sinjun's search for love. It is very funny and captivating. Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books. She should have quit while she was ahead."
5,BEST SHOP VACUUM EVER!,"We are extremely happy with this shop vacuum. Having owned several over the years, we almost didn't get another one. They are often hard to use, difficult to roll, don't suction well and are cumbersome. Not this one. It's beautiful, rolls perfectly, doesn't tip over, has superior suction, excellent tool attachments and a nifty angle for the hose that is ergonomic. Our garage and patios have never looked better!It does require assembly, which took about a half hour and only requires a screw driver. It was worth it."
4,Relaxing Pablum for the Dental Chair,"I don't know why people insist upon calling this ""Smooth Jazz""--there is nothing jazzy about Peter White or this CD. It is bascially acoustic guitar in an echo chamber with an under-mixed drum trap set. Don't get me wrong here, the music is good, but it basically the Gypsy Kings on qualudes.Yes, the first 3 tracks feature an actual jazz musician, Boney James, which are ""Caravan of Dreams"", ""Together Again"", and ""Venice Beach"" but the best sounds are just Peter White with his guitar in the echo chamber and a drum machine, playing music for the dental chair--""City of Lights""If you are looking for a jazzy sound of smooth jazz with the typical R&B; song put to an instrumental interpretation, do not buy this CD.But if you looking for relaxing pablum, this is CD is for you."
4,A nice little book,"Book # 1 of this series is Rowan Hood, about Rowan and her ancillary band to Robin's in the Sherwood Forest. Book # 2 is Lionclaw. Book # 3 is this one about Princess Ettard, a 13 year old who is rescued by Rowan and friends from a marraige to a wealthy landowner. In this, there is more backstory to Etty, we find out more about her parents and why her father is the tyrant king he is. I haven't read Lionclaw, the book about Lionel, yet, but I don't *think* this novel would stand well on its own."
3,Outlaw Princess Of Sherwood,"The Outlaw Princess Of Sherwood was a great book. There were some parts that were awesome. It really reeled the reader in, but some parts were kind of boring.I would give it a 3 on a scale of 1-5. If you like adventurous books or if you like books with a lot of action, then this is the book for you. It was exciting and fun to read. I didn't know what was going to happen next."
4,Twist on Robin Hood,"Rowan Hood, the daughter of legendary outlaw Robin Hood lives in Sherwood Forest just like her father. Just like her father, she cannot stand when a big rich king bullies someone poor. In this case, it is her new friend, Princess Etty. A pretty good book by Nancy Springer, Outlaw Princess showed good promise for a new twist on Robin Hood."
3,outlaw princess,I thought that the book was good and everything but I really did'nt get it.I would recommend the book to people and friends.The book was a little messed up at the beginning but I finished the book. I think the book had alot of description of the characters.I gave the book 3 stars becouse the book was o.k. and everything but the book was not that intresting and I didn't like when the princess was going to kill her father and she liked the mother better then her father.
3,The Outlaw Princess of Sherwood,I gave this book three stars because it had too much detail in some parts and that made it long and boring. In other parts it wasn't long enough. Some parts gave me a headache and made me not want to continue. I do not recommend this book
2,this book is a HORROR(burns eyes do not read),I give this book 2 stars. it started with a princess who wanted to be in an outlaw group. but the king is tring to stop her. overall th book was.......BAD! I wish there was more fighting in it. I think the book should have been more interesting. I would not recommend this book to other people. I hope I helped your with your decision.(do not read it was horrible)(get a life)
1,no details about item,Will only fit a paintball gun. Nothing else i have tried on airsoft and real guns. It has a very small rail point
1,Stay away from the DV6000 and 9000 series!!!!,"Along with the other review, I too have had a similar experience with the now infamous disappearing wireless capabilities this product is advertised to have. Along with the same experience with HP's customer support, I can never recommend an HP computer to anyone. The known HUNDREDS of consumers with this issue have been sold lemons, so stay away from the DV6000 and DV9000 series. Do a google search for ""DV6000 wireless issue""-Nate"
5,Great Laptop,"I have this laptop for almost 2 years and it works great with no problems. I just installed Windows 7 on it and it works very fast. I play many video games on it like Need for speed and Call of duty. It has a very good graphics card. Great screen size for games and movies. Also, the blu ray drive is such an awesome thing to be on this laptop. Reviews say that there are problems with wireless; I never had any wireless problems. It could be that their units are defective."
5,Excellent Photography book,"Excellent book. I would recommend this to anyone interested in photography. The product was as described, in excellent condition and I received it quickly."
5,Perfect for the active teen!,"I originally purchased these for one of my boys. He was very active in school, working, and had a girlfriend. He never seemed to eat right and he insisted on working out to build muscle. However, he always seemed tired and napped a lot. The lady at the health food store recommended these vitamins to us. My son was hesitant, but he took them and found that he had increased energy and felt better all over. He continues to take them years later and still swears by them. If you have an active teen that doesn't always eat properly, this is the magic vitamin!"
5,Down II: A Bustle In Your Hedgerow - another amazing record from a supergroup Down,"Another super record of a super group Down, this time with a touch of blues.Aside from that it is still a good old fusion of Black Sabbath style heavy metal, southern rock and hardcore punk.Phil's vocals on this record are a bit louder.Those who are familiar with Down and Sludge Metal in general won't be disappointed.People who haven't listened to Down.. better start to...Should i remind that the band features a legendary Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo?"
1,Hp 56 black refurbished cartridges,Whatever ink they are using dries up if not used for a month or two and cartridge is unuseable.This does not happen with Factory cartridges. Seller said they would exchange but I am not willingto go through this again. I am going to stay with factory cartridges. A lesson learned I guess.
4,quality ink,"even this ink is remanufactured one,quality is still expected.the ink seems to last a long time.with good quality of print on paper.this is a good product!"
1,"Waste of money, including the paper I wasted to ""print"" with this ink","I paid $6.85 for this, thinking I scored a great deal on print ink and I was being a good global citizen by buying recycled products. It turns out I wasted $6.85 on crap that works no better than the expired cartridge I wanted to replace. Now I see the price on this item dropped to $1.85. Save your dollar and spend it on ink that will actually come out of the cartridge and onto your intended document as one should reasonably expect of a cartridge of ink."
1,NOT RECOGNIZED BY HP Officejet,"It worked a few times and that's it. Waste of money and time. My Officejet displays ""Remove and Check Black Cartridge"", which I have done multiple times with no success."
2,worked and now does not,The black ink cartridge is for this HP printer and worked for less than a month with limited use but as of very recent messages started from the printer that now make the ink cartridge use very user NON friendly. Possibly the seller has a solution for such. At this point it is just not worth the time and trouble to self troubleshoot such things.
3,It's all black and white! :0(,"I am building a Colonial period dollhouse and looked forward to this book showing me what rooms of that era looked like. There were a few color plates at the beginning and that's all. The rest of the photos are excellent, but all of them are black and white! Because of the lack of color photography, I'm kind of disappointed in this book. In terms of showing furniture styles and arrangement, this book was fine. But I will have to go somewhere else to get an idea of color schemes used in the Colonial period."
3,OK Read,"Very well written. Not a book I would read again. I loved his book ""The Last Werewolf!"" He is a great writer."
1,A waste of money,I purchase this Midland Radio because I live in a state that is prone to severe weather. Since I purchased it and programmed it I get the same message. (Check reception). A friend in the same town purchase one also. He gets the same message. We both review our setting. And put in the correct county codes. Same results.I have read plenty of reviews since I purchase this radio. Some suggest putting up an external antenna. That's not going to happen. That is like asking me to move my bedroom up to the attic to improve reception.I work on and repair computers. So am tech aware. This radio is extremely difficult to program. There is no test button to check to see if it is working properly.So unless you live on a hill and near a tower don't purchase this radio. Its a waste of money.
2,Inferior design,"I originally purchased this product, but was so disappointed in its user interface (i.e. it was a pain in the butt to program and setup) that I sent it back.Based upon some of the 500+ comments, I bought the Reecom R-1650 Weather Alert Radio, and 100% recommend it over the Midland. The Reecom is well worth the extra money."
2,Very Unhappy,"I am very disappointed in this item. Three members of my family bought Midland weather radios in 2008. One of them had problems 6 months after buying and they returned for a new one. The other two lasted 1.5 years and just stopped working. Because the warranty only covers 1 year, we contacted Midland and got absolutely nowhere. I will never buy another Midland product. I just ordered a new First Alert and we will see if that lasts more than 1 year."
3,...limited review...,"I have only had the WR300 for a couple of months and really have not had but 2 or 3 alerts come along. The alerts were definitely for one of the dozen or so specific areas that I had programmed into the radio and that was nice. The setup was quite user friendly -though a bit long and tedious- with the instructions. I definitely agree with any and all negative reviews concerning the FM radio, the reception is horrible. I would overlook this a little if I could at least program no less than ten radio frequencies, but that is not the case. The low rating is, at this time, soley based on this one aspect. If possile then I will update this at a future time with more about what the radio is really designed and meant to be used for."
2,Beware of this Junk,"The first unit lasted almost 5 months. Then the LCD display went on the fritz, giving me just gibberish. Sometimes pressing the buttons got a response, often times not. I had to pay to return the first radio for repair or replacement. The company promptly shipped me a replacement that brand new, out of the box, DID NOT WORK. I had to shell out more money to return it to them the same week. So far I've invested $11 in shipping back two defective $50 weather radios. I'm not happy and I'd really like my money back."
1,Don't order this product,"This product arrived very promptly, but was not in working order. I could not even get the info window to light up and there was absolutely no sound. It was promptly shipped back for a refund and I went to Radio Shack and bought a great replacement."
4,High Quality,"Midland WR300 Weather radio is high quality, excellent sound with the warnings. Only big complaint is it sounds in the middle of the night for thunderstorms. I only want Tornado warnings in the middle of the night but can not change radio just to alert for that. It alerts for everything. In the middle of the night it is not so great to get up to turn it off for reports other than tornado warnings."
2,midland wr300,"Programming is difficult, and the instructions cannot be relied on for accuracy. Power consumption on batteries is excessive. This cannot be used as a radio during power outage.MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio"
3,not reccomended,This radio is MUCH more complicated to set up than all the reviews I read would have you believe. We still haven't managed to turn it into a clock radio despite trying for over a week to program it. It may alert you to weather conditions but it doesn't do what I wanted it to do.
2,Review,"Midland WR-300 AM/FM Weather/All Hazards/Civil Emergency Alert Monitor with S.A.M.E.I bought this with the goal of hearing weather hazards and emergency storm warnings, especailly after one very windy night in which it sounded like my roof was going to blow off the house. I hear the local weather reports but I am unable to hear the SAME reports and unable to recive the advisories and warnings the radio is programed to receive. The radio reception is poor; the antenna Midland sells to improve reception is not designed for a home application; rather, it is designed for mobile/car applications. I am glad I save $50 buying it through Amazon.com rel to direct from Midland, esp due to the poor reception."
4,"Alarm on/off is confusing, but other functions are great!","My son enjoys very much the opportunity to listen to weather and climate data and forecasts at his leisure. The voice, sound and light indicators provide excellent prompts regarding weather watches and warnings. I cannot figure out easily how to turn off the alarm, however."
1,DOESN'T WORK,HARD TO PROGRAM. WEB PAGE VIDEO IS NOT FOR THIS PRODUCT. WARNING SYSTEM AND THE WEEKLY TEST DOES NOT WORK.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
2,Worked for 3 weeks - then died,"I initially setup this weather radio and liked being able to program it. Everything seemed to be working fine.After about three weeks I checked it and it has stopped receiving the weather radio. I changed the position and even moved it right next to my 2nd upstairs weather radio, but had no luck.It appears some part has stopped working.I appreciate Amazon taking it back up to 30 days.Please check yours around the 3 week period to make sure it is still working.I won't buy this model again."
2,Unit failed after 2 years,"I had this connected to an external antenna. The unit worked well and I was able to select the area I wanted with the S.A.M.E. technology and the alerts I wanted and didn't want. I started getting a message ""check op"" which means it is not getting signal. I press the -weather- button on top and I get silence. I had an older Radio Shack Weather Radio (without S.A.M.E.) and placed it next to this Midland and was able to hear the weather announcement without the external antenna. I tried the regular antenna on the Midland and still no weather. I have always been skeptical of Midland from past experiences but gave them another chance. This was Midland's last chance with me and the unit failed. I have no recommendation for another manufacturer but I plan to try another manufacturer out. Bottom Line: Good when it worked, I do not recommend Midland products. If anybody has had any luck with other Manufacturers please leave a comment, thank you."
1,Midland makes garbage... Don't buy,We have this radio and it died shortly after warranty expired. Talked to midland customer service and was basically told too bad and that I needed to buy a new radio to replace. We've decided to not purchase another midland product again. Terrible products and I would love to give company zero stars...
2,50 mile range w/o optional ($20) outside antenna,"You need to see where the latest NWS transmitter is at. Unit works in St. Louis, but not at my home. FM radio works great. I'm afraid of buying the optional window antenna. If I new it would fix my reception problem would be no brainer. Good luck."
4,Midland weather radio,"This product is full of features and easy to use. The one problem with it is that the time on the face of the radio is not easily visible. The date is huge, but the clock is a small space in the corner. If this radio is not being used as an alarm clock, it is great!"
4,"Midland WR-300 AM/FM, Hazards etc. monitor","I did enter in the counties I wished to have on the monitoring alert system. Three days later, a weather outbreak of tornado warnings came to the area and it worked--unfortunately it was during the early morning 2 - 5am, but it worked fine. Also a day later, got a child alert."
3,Weather Alarm Clock,"I really liked that this product's ease of setting up and its small size does not take up a lot of space. There are a few things I did not like: 1. The time is very small in the corner of the display screen and the calendar date and year is the main numbers showing, 2: There is little control for the lumination of the screen, either very bright or off, and finally 3: You cannot push any buttons without the keys beeping. Hopefully I will never have to hear the alarms because I turned everything off except for the tornado warnings. Hope it works if necessary."
2,long process to program,"it was a pain to program this thing. so far the antenna is not getting good reception where it is. i got it for overnight tornado warnings/watches, and it definitely didn't go off last week when we had one. it flashes poor reception, but only every couple minutes so it's hard to catch."
3,"May be one of the best, but room for improvement...","Good features, can avoid annoying alarms for watches. We are using this as our alarm clock and the time display needs to be larger, and it is not apparent what time the alarm is set for without pushing a few buttons. Biggest complaint is that the display window needs help!"
2,worked for 6 months,"I liked the radio until it stopped receiving weather alerts of any kind. I couldn't even simply pickup the weather report. When I looked into sending it back since it is still under warrenty, they want it packed it its original box! What is the chance anyone keeps the original boxes to anything shipped? Then they want $7.50 for shipping and handling and finally IF they decide it doesn't fall under the warrenty, they will charge me $45.00 to fix it which is more than what I paid for the radio. Too bad they don't tell you this stuff up front. Of course I expected it to work longer than six months also!"
3,"Getting better, but more please","Ok, I was looking forward to being able to select witch watch/ warnings to set off the siren since the local city siren I can actually sleep right through since not very loud. Old nowa radios waking me up when not truly life threatening is not cool so GREAT improvement; however, I would like to have Tornado Watch & Warning activated with the exception of different sounds for each so I know ""stay aware"" versus ""get up now and into the bath tub"". Using the voice for watch versus siren for warning would help.Also, I was going through all the codes to activate and deactivate and was confused why I couldn't locate Tornado Warning. The instructions were unclear that they are not listed cause you can not change them (at least this is what I am assuming). That's ok, just the instructions confused me."
5,Best bang for the buck,"With many recent tornados and severe storms, we decided it was time to get a weather radio. After a lot of research, the Midland WR-300 radio was the best product available within our price range - and even better than many expensive options. It allows us to program our county and the local NOAA radio and an AM/FM station to get local coverage. Its automatic alarm is loud enough to wake us and the neighbors before it reaches the loudest setting. I would recommend this radio for anyone who needs a weather radio!"
4,Nice Weather Radio,I've had this weather radio since spring 2006. It has a very loud alert system for weather watches and warnings. It is a little difficult to set up. That's the reason for the four stars. Bottom line: I wouldn't be without this weather radio.
5,Great radio,"A great asset for being in Oklahoma and in tornado alley; I had purchased this for my mom as she is rather afraid of severe weather. The programmable alerts for specific counties is a great feature. I also like the blue backlight and the ability to go from battery power to AC power. However one drawback was having to disable the unecessary alerts: such as avalanche, hurricane, etc."
5,Good buy,I happened to catch this new for $8.50. Works well and has SAME technology. Can be set for watches and/or warnings.
4,Nice Radio,"The weather & storm side of this radio is great. We bought it because we slept through our town's tornado siren three months ago. Our grandson and his friend where staying over that night, and, yes, we had a tornado touch down about one mile from our house about midnight. Now, with the weather alerts we feel much more secure. However, the clock radio side has two, in our opinion, shortcomings that limit its use. First, the backlight can either be on or off, there is no brightness control. When ""off"", the time cannot be seen at night. When ""on"" it is too bright to sleep. Second, there is no ""sleep"" function. We like to go to sleep with the radio on and are used to our old radio which had a setting where the radio was on for 30 minutes. We can't do that on this radio. Everything else is great. Reception, alarm tone, etc."
4,so long tv weatherman,"The best purchase I made this year. Combo clock radio/weather on demand is perfect for my lifestyle. I barely have a chance to listen to the news throughout the day. With a touch of the button, I can know what to expect in the next 24 hours. I'm looking forward to winter this year for the fact that I can get the weather any time at any moment and with the large amounts of snow that we get, can determine if I should snow blow in the morning or wait till later on.It has three memory settings for different radio stations which is adequate. I love the bluelight backlight on the display and the beeps that some people say are annoying can be, but for the most part you get used to it and it's not that big a deal. I would highly recommend the product."
5,A requirement for tornado pron areas...,"I've used this model of radio for several years and if you live in areas like Missouri where the weather changes on a dime, this is a requirement. I have the radio programmed for a four county area and in the spring and fall it has activated to warn of bad weater giving extra time to prepare before the storms arrive....a must buy"
3,Extremely tedious to setup,Plan to spend two or three hours to disable useless warnings that will wake you throughout the night. I would give it 4 stars if the setup was more practical.
4,Midland Review,Excellent product....just found the instructions on how to program and set up a little hard to understand.
4,Midland WR-300 great value,"The Midland WR-300 is a nice looking weather radio that took 20 minutes to program (I didn't read the instructions, so I had to go back and reset a few things that took some additional time.) I am very happy with my purchase."
5,A great radio,"A weather radio is only as good as the strength of your reception. The weather service in Ohio only puts out 500 watts compared to twice that of some states yet despite the fact that I live in a sub-ground apartment near lake Erie this radio pulls in every alert I programmed it to.I really like the sleek design, nice job Midland. Instructions are easy to understand and you'll have the unit working in no time.My advice is to write down your local weather code and tape it to the back of the radio so you don't have to go online and look for it later. The good news is that this radio doesn't lose memory function when the back up battery is removed. That it such a pain to deal with with other models.The alarm is substantial enough to wake me out of a sleep and the AM/FM reception is strong with a nice speaker. There are other features to speak of but my advice to you is to buy this unit. It's well designed and looks great anywhere in the house or boat"
1,poorly packaged,"poorly packaged in vanilla envelope and one strip of bubble rap. side crushed in did ,not work.returned for refund, not replaceble item.were previous complants of poor packaging,i should have heeded advice."
1,bad power supply,included power supply would not power up radio...should be 12V but measures > 20V unloaded
1,Warning This Radio is not reliable,"MIDLAND WR300 Weather RadioI purchased this radio and believe the radio is either defective or impossible to program. I am skilled in electronics and cannot program this radio. The instructions are totally counter-intuitive.If you follow them to the letter you still can't get the radio to work. I asked help from a ham operator, skilled in radio repair, and he gave up on the entire thing, saying he could not program the radio, and suggested I return it, and buy something else. I am frustrated with the entire thing, disappointed and out nearly $50. Look at the other reviews and see how many speak of the difficulty of programing the radio and the exceptionally poor instructions. I highly recommend you NOT purchase this radio unless you want much difficulty and possibly a radio that will not work properly."
5,WR300 Weather radio,"THis was purchased for a Christmas gift , still a few months away. But appears in perfect condition. I am sure as others have posted it will do what it is suppose to do ."
2,Really bad clock,"If having a good bedside clock is among your priorities, this is NOT the radio for you. The digital time display is tiny and hardly visible (as is the whole screen for that matter) during day or night. I've perused the manual word by word looking for a way to change the screen or to enlarge the time display, to no avail. it can probably save your life, but will annoy you to death trying to figure out what time it is."
1,Poor reception,This small radio has virtually no reception in this area without an external antenna. It is expensive to find this out and pay freight both ways + additional return charges.
3,works well... but display is WAY TOO LIGHT !!!!!!!,had this for 2 months took a week til it finally went off on the weekly test. Easy to program so get the county codes you want to be alerted on from online noaa weather gov site. went nuts during thunderstorm activity which i liked all the notifications. however the display is way too light and no adjust for brightness. Shame on midland. I bought way cheapER ELECtronics and they had adjustments for lcd display brightness. am radio reception works well. I also like how you can edit out notifications that you would never get in your area also.
1,Wait Till You've had It A While...,"Mine worked great for about a year or so. Then it just quit. I keep getting the ""Check Reception"" error. I have tried everything the Midland Radio website suggests to fix it. Nothing. Don't waste your money. All the good reviews are from people who have only had it a short time."
5,Great Item,I read a lot of reviews on different radios before I settled on this item and I believe the other reviews were accurate. This radio was easy to set up and get into operation and it has already worked by notifying us of a flood watch for our area. I'm very happy with it and very glad I took the time to read the reviews on Amazon to know which product to choose and which ones to stay away from. Keep the reviews coming.
1,Don't buy a Midland weather radio,"I normally like Midland products, but I purchased a Midland WR-300 weather radio. It's extremely difficult to program (counter-intuitive), doesn't respond per the instructions, the display is faint and difficult to read, the AM/PM indicators are small even under magnification, and the clock keeps going totally haywire. Yes, it delivers alerts, but it's quite unsatisfactory otherwise. I've since purchased both a Radio Shack weather radio (and I usually avoid Radio Shack procucts) and a Reecom 1630, and both work very well, are easy to program, and have excellent displays. Don't think large companies are monolithic. Good products of one kind from a company don't necessarily guarantee good products of another kind. The particular engineers assigned to the WR-300 product failed to deliver a good product this time."
1,Forget it.,"It's difficult to set up. and thus far, even though we've had storm warnings, tornado watches, and flash flood warnings, bless its little heart----it has sat there perfectly quiet. Don't waste your money."
2,display does not work properly,"I ordered the radio in response to the recent severe tornadoes in my area. The alarm works fine, however the display goes out. It scrolls characters that you can not read. Had to push buttons unplug etc. to get display showing again. At times when I have just looked to check the time the display will have zero's with x's in them. The weather radio works great. Just not the display. Will purchase another NOAA radio with SAME Tech. Just a high price for this radio and for it to not be fully functional. Overall poor quality for the price."
4,Midland wr300 weather radio,With weather getting more unpredictable every year this radio is must have item in every home. I do recommend this product.
1,Stopped working after 1.5 yrs,This was a great radio for about a year and a half. It stopped working on the weather channels. Still works fine on AM and FM but it is silent on the weather channels. No weather channel reception means no weather alerts either. A quick Google search revealed that this is a VERY common problem with Midland weather radios. I do not recommend this radio. I'll be buying a different brand when I replace it.
4,Really Like the Radio!,"This is the second one of these weather radios I have purchased. I gave my first one to my daughter and her husband who live in a rural area so that they can keep track of the weather. I like the am/fm feature as my old radio did not have that, and after one storm we were without power for several hours and we stumbled around the house looking for a radio and batteries to find out what was happening in the community."
4,Midland radio,Bought this for my dad as a father's day gift. It was exactly what he wanted. He especially likes the programmable memory.Looks white in the image but is actually silver.
4,Very helpful,Ordered three of these radios for the family. A few weeks later we had one of the worst tornado outbrakes in Tennessee history. Many deaths and much destructions nearby. These radios really work. It is conforting to go to sleep at night knowing the alerts will sound.Cons: Battery life is poor. The radio really needs to recharge the battery and keep it charged.
4,Good unit for money but needs better time display,"Time display too small, difficult to read in bed. If time display was an LED, and not a LCD, it would be easier to see. Should be able to set wake up alarm in fewer steps. Emergency alert alarm works well and like feature to manage desired warnings. Midland should offer a ""higher end"" product, I would be willing to pay for it. This unit is a good quality product for the money."
1,MIDLAND WR300 better than expected (OR SO I THOUGHT),"Some reviews made me cautious about this product but once I set it up, it was better than I expected. The AM/FM radio is more of an after thought but the primary use I wanted was WEATHER and it is superb. It is much better than the old Radio Shack SAME radio I had till it died.It is easy to set up and has plenty of options that make this SAME WEATHER Radio a must have for anyone who needs or wants a reliable (?) SAME Weather Radio.The AM/FM section is for general news, NOT music. It is not a good AM/FM radio but is sufficient for my purpose and does bring in the 3 AM and 3 FM stations I need.2/27/2011.......UPDATE, UPDATE:>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Just as this radio passed it's one year anniversary, the thing STOPPED receiving WEATHER transmissions. What a BUMMER !!!"
5,Least Price for all the Necessary Features,"I researched all the weather radios listed on the NOAA website and this model Midland had all the necessary features at the best price. It was easy to program and gives you absolute control on what you want to be alerted about and from which broadcast towers - and I use it for an alarm clock to boot. (The FM/AM radio sounds like the 6-transistor radios of old though! But you aren't buying this to jam to anyway.) You may have to buy an external antenna; I did, but I live in a mobile home."
2,The 120 is better,"I purchased the little brother of this radio, the 120, because it got good reviews. But then I had second thoughts because the 300 would let me select which alerts I wanted to attend to. (Both models let me choose whcih counties I'm interested in ).Well, the 300 is going back. The LCD display on the 120 was very easy to read even with the back light off. But the display on the 300 is very dim unless you crouch down in front of it and view it at a low angle.I don't know whether mine was flawed or whether there's an actual design issue."
1,Quit working after a year,"Same problem as many other users, worked fine for about a year. We were expecting some severe weather so I pressed the ""Weather"" button on the radio just to verify that I could hear a NOAA broadcast and heard nothing but silence. Tried reprogramming, changing batteries, all the usual stuff. Weather radio function just dead.I will not buy another Midland"
1,No Sound with Tornado Warning/ Then no Reception at 9 Months.,"During a tornado warning in our area, the red light came on and the tornado warning message was displayed butthe alarm did not sound. I verified that the siren was set to ""on"" andthat the volume was up, and used the test function and it sounded thealarm. The settings were all correct. Customer service said that I can send it to them for service. Good thing the tornado didn't pass over us, because then it would really need service!UPDATE - 9 months old and now the unit does not receive the weather broadcast- the AM/FM works but the weather function is dead. Tried resetting by removing power and batteries, still not working. What a piece of junk!"
2,"Midland Weather radio-useful, could be better","The radio was easy to program. It's nice to pick up local forecasts. I haven't had an emergency, yet, so I haven't tested its emergency warning capability yet. That is our primary reason for purchase."
5,excellent weather radio,love the feature of not having to be disturbed by all allerts. can select which results to be notified about and which counties
4,Great weather radio,This is a great weather radio. It is easy to use and works exactly as advertised.
5,Midland Radio,"Great product, arrived on time, but a bit confusing to program, especially for Grandmas."
2,Some kind of complicated,"Nothing is designed for ease of use, not even the instruction book. You write information you need for setting the clock on one page but the instructions for entering that information is half a book away. Back lighted screen can only be easily seen from one angle. Wake up alarm switch is not easily reachable. My 9 dollar radio alarm has better radio reception. I am still trying to figure out how to wake up to music and not beep beep beep. ANd I giess I have not got the weather alarm set correctly because I received no warning for the icy roads.Oh well gives me something to do this weekend."
5,Excellent product,Purchased as a Christmas present. Bought one last year for my self and really enjoy it.
5,Purchased for Selective Alert Filtering,"I purchased the Midland WR300 weather radio not so much for S.A.M.E. support, but more because it offers selectable alerts depending upon the specific watch or warning. I live near the Gulf of Mexico, and while I appreciate being able to access marine weather, I typically do not have a need for immediately receiving most marine watches. The WR300 allows me to selectively filter alerts for these numerous marine statements, while still receiving the important weather notices I do immediately want."
3,Works great - for about 1-2 years,"I purchased this radio on Amazon in May of 2010, and it worked fantastic for about 18 months. But lately it does not do the testing anymore and no matter what troubleshooting guides I use, I cannot get the weather portion of the radio to work anymore. It won't pick up any of the stations, and it does not alert for severe weather anymore either. The sound isn't broken - alarm and FM radio work just fine. But the weather stations are no longer coming in. I get either dead silence or a loud squealing sound coming from the radio depending on if I hit any other buttons prior to hitting the weather button. All 7 channels do the same thing. I've reprogrammed it to no avail. I guess I'll be buying a new one simply because I do need the service and this seems to be the most reasonably priced radio, but from what I've read I guess they just don't last much longer than 1-2 years. Prepare to buy one every year or two if you want continued weather coverage."
4,Perfect for anyone who wants to be updated on developing Weather or other possible Emergency situations!,"I have owned several different Weather & Scanner radios over the past 3 decades. This is a very nice home unit.I did not find the button beep to be as loud or annoying as some reviews advised. For several of the functions, you can simply press and hold down the button (only one beep) to quickly proceed thru the setup. No need to press the button multiple times.The setup is very simple and does provide many options to personalize the unit to advise or not to advise (SIREN) of potential emergency situations.My only dislike is; I would like to have had one or two additional display lighting options.Example: I would like a longer light time of 30 seconds before the display light auto shuts off, and/or a lower light setting if you select the display light to be constantly on."
3,NOAA RADIO,This radio seems to work okay.I have not had any warnings yet to rate it.The down side of it is:the screen is not visible when you look straight at it:.If you get down closer to table level it becomes very visible like getting to far to the side of the old flat screen TV it disappears.I don't usually look at the screen much so I'm not going to return it.I don't know if they are all like that or not.My old one was a Midland cheaper model and it wasn't that way.It's just irritating when you have to do something to the radio.I also couldn't find a tornado warning on it.It has a tornado watch but I couldn't find the warning setting.That don't mean that It's not there.
3,Not sure yet,"I bought this weather radio prior to moving to Ringgold, GA , an area that was devastated earlier this year by a tornado. (I know, but what are the chances of the new place being hit?) I like the size and features on the radio. The price was good.What I didn't like was that while programming it, there were several times when nothing appeared on the display or the word ""unrecognized"" appeared. I'm not sure what that means.A good site on which to get step by step instructions for programing this radio is: [...]"
1,2 years later and no reception,"I absolutely loved this weather radio for 2 years and have kept it plugged in and turned on through the spring and summer storm months. All of a sudden this week I noticed through TV my area had a tornado watch but my radio didn't alert me, even though it is properly set and the antenna is in the same position it always is (and never had a problem with reception before). I have tried everything the manual says to do and after reading the 1 star reviews on here to see if anyone else had this problem after having the radio for awhile I have come to the conclusion that this is a design flaw.Don't be fooled by the positive reviews which are written by people who just started using the radio. I am a huge weather fanatic and LOVED that the radio allows you to program in counties and codes of alerts you want to hear but literally overnight it just does not work anymore. I can't get ANY weather station signal but I get the AM/FM signal just fine. I am very upset about this!"
4,Exceeded my expectation,"Fairly simple to setup, SAME configuration straight-forward (SAME code easy to obtain from NOAA website), small size, decent speaker quality, decent antenna gain, large LCD Screen informative, easy to distinguish concurrent alarms such as Severe Thunderstorm Watch and Tornado Warning issued simultaneously. Product also support external Antenna and external speaker connectivity, nice touch. I recommend this product."
2,Midland WR-300 not easy,"I am an experience computer user, nevertheless, to this day, I have not been able to get this weather radio to function as well as my previous Radio Shack weather radio. The severe weather warnings do not play automatically but I do get lots of sirens without identifying the reason, although mostly seems to be for weekly checks.The user document must have been written in foreign countries. I would not recommend."
2,Midland WR-300 AM/FM Weather Radio,The first radio I received the LCD readout did not work. Amazon was goodwith replacing it I had the new one in about 5 days. The replacement is very difficult to program I will have to call the factory to program it.I would not recommend this product.
1,Is it available?,"We cannot give a review of this item. We ordered it, but we received a Midland WR-300 which costs less than what we ordered but was charged for this radio. We already own a Midland WR-300 which stopped working properly in a short period of time. After contacting Amazon via email they assume no responsibility for this."
2,Display too dim,This item arrived promptly. It must be an older model. The display cannot be read in normal light or darkness. I programmed in the channels and it appears to work. I will donate this item and purchase a newer Midland product.
1,Not Favorable,"I am a former electronics technician; and I have an engineering degreee and a computer science degree, and I have to take this Midland WR-300 to Radio Shack to get it programmed, and I should have gone there in the first place. The directions are among the worse I have ever read."
2,Its OK,"It might be operator error, but I still cant get the specific county alerts to work right on this thing. Just when I think its set up right, we get a severe thunderstorm box over my area (verified from the weather channel) and this thing will just sit right thru it, without warning me at all. Not using it like I thought I would, pretty much have given up on it........"
3,WR300 weather radio,"Works ok and replaces both my old weather radio and am/fm radio in one package. Changing weather channels is clumsy, you have to go into a programming mode and then it won't turn off for about 20 seconds but then turns itself off after about that long on the new channel. I agree with another review complaining about the loud beep every time you press any button."
3,midland weather radio,Programming local stations doesn't appear to be affective to date. Only has three FM stations that can be programmed. Maybe we haven't spent enough time reading all the instructions but you certainly can't just take it out of the box and have the weather functions operational.
1,A Piece of Junk,"I purchased this radio after my Radio Shack weather radio died after 18 mos. of use. It is much easier to use. The radio reception stinks. The weather broadcast for our county originates in our town. Yet, the Midland radio cannot receive it clearly. Midland told me to try an external antenna. It made no difference. They then had me send it back for warranty repair. They sent me a new unit that is no better than the first. I NEVER had a reception problem with my Radio Shack radio. Save yourself the headaches and buy something else."
4,Great radio but..,The midland weather radio works great. It only has 3 presets for am / fm though. No seek feature. Also can't disable the beeping when you press buttons which gets old during set up as you will be pressing these buttons a lot.
2,The weather alert is so far DOA,"The radio is compact and easily programmed. The problem so far is the weather alert feature seems to not be working at all. We've had 4 different alerts, advisories, warnings since the product was received, and so far the alarm has not sounded once, nor is any message displayed in the screen. Maybe just a DOA example which needs to be replaced, but who likes to have to do that? I've written directly to the Midland Company to see what they have to say, but if they don't respond I'll have to return it for a replacement. Bottom line, it needs to work for weather alerts; that's what it is for."
3,Warehouse out till September,I made purshase of WR300 as a gift but they shipped the 100 model. They said the 300 model is sold out until September 2007. They gave me option for difference in price $16.19 or send back to warehouse for full refund.
3,"Tricky to program; power outlet requires, well, power.","When I turn something on I don't like to think about it too much. For instance, a digital Casio wristwatch is impossible to ""program"" (if you will) without the map from Hades instructions it comes with. This radio is a little like that. It seems to have a lot of features which I'll never use and seems overly complicated. Shouldn't every device be just like an ipod? :) I still have not received the Wednesday test warning that goes out from my local NOAA station.Also, it does require power. OH but this guy needs special power. I hope you weren't planning to have something plugged into that other outlet you're using with this. Because the radio won't get a signal when it's plugged in along with another device. OK, great for you HAM guy, you know all about radios and power and stuff. You called an electrician and got an extra receptacle just for this radio. You're amazing."
2,"Works fine, not intuitive for non-geeks, poor display features, controls","Got this as a potential gift for an elderly family member. Ended up keeping it because controls are not intuitive and display is poor. Sort of ended up as the worst of both worlds- not a particularly good weather radio, not a particularly good radio.If you are a weather geek, or use all the buttons on your tv remote than this might be for you, but if you are basic on/off volume kind of person there's way too much going on."
1,Poor quality control?,"This is our second midland weather radio, and the second one that died a quick death. The first just outright died shortly after the warranty period expired. This one the screen died, and no longer can be read. The backlight works and the machine itself works, but I just can't use it since I can't read the screen.We only use this in the summer since that is our stormy season, and after the season, it gets unplugged and the batteries removed. So it probably has less than 6 months total usage and is worthless. the manual says I can send it in to get fixed, for $45 +8 shipping? I could buy a new one for less. This will be the last midland product we purchase."
4,A Good Investment,"For the average shopper and searching through many monitor's, this is the best ""alert monitor"" for the price! It is user friendly and very easy to program utilizing step-by-step instructions. After one tornado touched down last year in this area, I wish I had purchased this monitor sooner!!"
2,Mine lasted 3 years,"I liked the features and was happy with my MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio, but it stopped receiving weather band broadcast after just three years of use. No more alerts, no more weather. Now it's just an AM/FM radio. The weather broadcast in my area is not to blame; my portable weather radio still receives it."
2,Static,"I ordered the Midland WR300 for weather. After going from room to room placing the radio by the window mostly static. Only got reception in the morning for a short time. This is not a radio that you can rely on for reports. We are in a location where there is good reception. What a disappointment for weather reports! But the AM/FM works great, this would be okay if that was the sole reason for ordering the Midland WR300.Sarasota Florida"
1,"Worked well, looked nice, but ultimately failed on me","I bought this weather radio back in May 2008. It was somewhat complicated to set up, but once done with the initial setup it performed well. About a month ago the first set of batteries I put in there ran out. I put fresh ones in there and tested to make sure it still worked. Well, everything except the weather alerts and radio work, defeating the point of the weather radio. I have no idea how long I have been missing important messages. It turns out it is pretty common for the weather portion of this radio to fail. I would look elsewhere for a weather radio. My old Radio Shack one with SAME capability has worked for over 10 years."
4,Midland WR300 Review,"The weather radio works as advertised. I set mine up to alarm for only Tornado Warnings. I have two minor complaints - the backlight does not stay on long enough to read messages (you have to keep pushing a button to keep it on). Second, the snooze button is not the large button in the middle :)"
3,inadequate,"The programming info is flawed. The display is hard to read. Still haven't figured how to make it do what I thought it is supposed to do. On battery power, don't count on more than about a day--I haven't gone back to check exactly how long a set works, but the first set was short lived. nuf said. When I get back to it I will seek something better.robert"
1,Weather function stopped working,The radio worked well for 3 years. Then I noticed the weather function stopped working. AM FM still works but weather and alert functions do not. I don't know exactly when they failed. Kind of scary.
4,Weather Radio Review,"We have had a Midland WR300 Weather Radio for a number of years and have had no problems with it. As we have extreme weather conditions in the spring and summer that are favorable for severe thunderstorms and tornados here in the Midwest, we have depended on it for updated information. It is fairly easy to program so you only get information immediate to your area or as close by as you want. We like it so much, we bought 3 of them for our adult children now that they are out on their own."
2,When it works it's near perfect.,"I have owned this radio for three years now and it has worked great up until two months ago when it stopped receiving the SAME alerts. At first I thought it was my local station, contacted them and they said the system has been working fine. All radios work including the weather, but the unit no longer receives the alerts of any kind. Midland wants $52 to repair it, just not worth it. Seems to be a common theme from other users. Buyer beware!"
4,even little ol' ladies can program it,"Just wanted to say, I'm the little ol' lady from popular mythology, and I managed to set mine up, so, it can't be all that bad."
4,Nice to feel safe.,"This is very useful for alerting you in the middle of the night. Just be sure to enter only the alerts you are interested in, and in the counties you are interested. We didn't do anything when we first got it...just plugged it in, and we were awakened at night with AMBER ALERTS. That is such an eery feeling to be woken at 1:00 in the morning, and hear about who took whom. We need to know, but not a 1:00 in the morning. Anyway, I entered only weather watches and warnings in our locale. With that done, it is very useful! We even gave one to my in-laws---we were sure to program it correctly for them."
1,Good until it died...,"My experience was like that of several other reviewers. The unit worked well for a couple of years, but today I realized that the weather radio function had died. We had severe thunderstorm watches and warnings all afternoon, but not a peep from the weather radio. The clock and am/fm functions still work, but the weather alert is completely out. When the unit was working, you could listen to the weather broadcast by pushing the Weather Hazard On/Off bar, even when there was no alert. Now, not even that function works. I have ordered a replacement (and it's not another Midland)."
4,"Good value, very pleased",We were very happy with the purchase. It was easy to program for our local area. My only minor complaint is that the backlight is like a searchlight at night (way too bright) and without it you cannot see the time at night.
1,Midland WR-300 NOAA radio function failed after 2 years,"If I had rated this product after I first bought it or within the first couple of years of owning it, I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately I can't give it a ZERO but instead will go one star. I have owned this weather radio for 2 years and when I needed the NOAA warning features the most with Severe Thunderstorms and Tornado Warnings in my area, the Midland WR-300 sat in silence. No warning tone, no NOAA radio, no alert lights displaying, the only thing that now functions is the AM/FM radio. This was the first major severe weather event of the year and had no reason to think it would fail. With my next radio I will make sure to test it on my own each week but it will NOT be a Midland."
3,alert monitor,"A little trouble programing the radio. Would like it if the radio had a dial instead of a button to change stations. Only has a few pre-set stations. Too many steps to set alarm,time, date etc. Not too bad in setting the county codes for alerts. Hope never to have to get alerts , but here in Florida it's a waiting game. Should have seen radio in person before I bought it."
5,NOAA radio,Great product. Allows you to program mult counties so that you are ahead of severe weather. Also love that I can turn off alerts such as flood warnings and ones that I don't want to be bothered with
5,Working great so far!,"Purchased this for my parents. Helped them program it for their region and their specific alerts of interest. Having the ability to program specific counties and alerts is very nice! This radio is to replace a competitor's unit that had similar features, but stopped working after only a couple years service. Hopefully this Midland will last longer!"
4,A quality unit with thoughtful design,"I really like the WR-300. It has a decent user interface, a very clear audio system, and lots of useful features. This is the unit to have by your bedside to wake you up in a crisis. It has a siren, plus blinking lights, plus a very loud and clear speaker for listening to voice announcements. You can't ignore warnings from this unit.As another reviewer notes, the WR-300 is not really designed as a bedside entertainment radio. Buy something else for that function. The loud beep on every keypress is deliberate and important -- it is to help you work the unit in noisy conditions, as you might have to in a storm. That's appropriate design, in my opinion.I bought one of these after Oxnard had a tidal wave warning that I only learned about hours after it had expired. I live on the flood plain, so tsunamis would be destructive. But with just a few minutes warning I could easily get into the high hills surrounding the basin. This box will give me that warning."
3,"very detailed ""set up""","I was looking for a N.O.A.A. weather radio which would receive my local weather station similar to one I owned many years ago. As with many things, nothing is easy anymore. This radio is very complicated to set up and takes way too much effort. The company WAS very co-operative however, in refunding my money. Communication and response time was very good."
1,Died just after a year of use,Worked well for just over a year then the weather radio stopped working. The AM/FM still works but who cares. Also it does not log the time/date for expired alerts which would be helpful.
3,O.K.,"Works good, although I cannot recieve enough signal to use the alert features. All it is good for is a weather radio, not alerts."
3,Where's the tornado warning alert,"I bought this radio for the tornado alerts that are issued at night. I have gone through the disable alert menu several times. On the list in the manual, there is a tornado watch and then listed a bit lower in the list is the tornado warning. On the alert list in the radio, there is no tornado warning to either enable or disable...am I missing some step?"
1,JUNK weather radio,"My next door neighbor & I bought the same model WR300. We live less than 10 air miles from National Weather Station in Chanhassen, MN. The storms came & the city of Chaska alarms went off, but not the radio. We each live in a 2 story house. Radio said check location for signal. We went all over the houses, upstairs, in front of windows & porch. No luck. Save your money & don't buy this product. Computer, cellphone and TV are better options."
5,Works great!,"What I like most about this weather radio is that you can set the weather alarm louder or quieter. I'm a very light sleeper, so I don't need a piercing alarm, and it won't wake up everyone else in the house just for a thunderstorm warning. On the other hand, if the weather is particularly bad and tornadoes are likely, I CAN set it loud so everyone can get down to the basement quickly!I also like being able to use the am/fm radio - that way I have only the ONE unit, and don't need a separate radio to wake up in the morning!Don't get me wrong, the radio isn't the best, but it's just as good as what I normally use on my nightstand. I don't need surround-sound to wake up in the morning.Overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase!"
5,Perfect,My daughter is really into hearing the weather and cant get enough of this. Plus it has a radio (am/fm) and alarm clock.
2,Clunky to configure,"As mentioned previously, navigating the menus to configure this thing is time consuming. And it beeps at you every time you click a button. And it's clunky to use as an alarm clock.My biggest gripe: Of the dozens of preset weather codes, the only one that seemed to be missing was the Tornado Warning code. Tornado warnings were the only reason I bought this thing. So I had to manually enter the code for tornado warnings. Hope I entered it correctly. Guess I'll find out one way or another.At least it had the codes already entered for Iceberg Warning, Dust Storm, Tsunami . . ."
4,Midland WR-300 AM/FM Weather/All Hazards/Civil Emergency Alert Monitor with S.A.M.E.,Unit seems to be very nice. I haven't had it very long and no storms have happened.
4,Great little radio,This is a good little radio with lots of great features. It's smaller than I thought it would be. One night we heard the alarm going off with an Amber Alert for a missing child. We thought that was pretty cool to receive those types of alerts as well. (We didn't expect that.) It's easy to set it all up and it's a very handy little thing to have around.
4,Weather radio,"First radio that came lasted one day before it quit. The second unit that was sent works fine and still works good with no problems at this time.The replacement unit was sent almost immediately after I advised of my problem. Service was very good with no problems. Second unit sent even before I sent the defective unit back, this was surprising. Pleasantly surprised. No complaints."
2,Directions,"The directions to set this up are confusing and months later I have not got it set up right which is disappointing because I spent a little more hoping to have a ""keeper"" but just like the others I've had this one isn't it."
5,Great Radio,No problems thus far. Received Winter Storm warning & Today's Weekly emergency test! Am/Fm reception is good as well. Love the looks of this radio. Easy to program.
4,One of the best weather radios for your home.,Very customizable for multiple SAME codes and warning event types. My only wish is that it had more audible alarm choices. This is much better than the $20 models so if you are looking for a step up this is what I would buy again.
2,Doesn't work,"Perhaps it's the fault of he NOAA signal, or lack thereof, but this unit doesn't work. I have a cheaper unit at work and it does work from the same broadcast frequency, 17 miles away.Setup and instructions are relatively easy- hope your works better than mine did."
4,I Like My New Radio,"The radio seems a bit difficult to program, but after playing with it for a while, all seems OK. I would recommend having one of these if you live in an area where severe weather is a possibility."
2,"Great Idea, Bad Product",The weather alert functions work just fine but that's where the positive comments end. The selectivity of the receiver both for the weather band and for the AM/FM bands is terrible. The sensitivity for the VHF weather band is quite good but the sensitivity on the AM/FM bands is not very good. If they improved these specifications significantly I would buy another unit.
4,good value for peace of mind knowing what the weather is doing.,"This weather alert radio lets you know when any alert, watch or warning is issued. However, it will wake you to alert other areas of warnings if you dont put in the S A M E codes for your area. This can keep you awake at night if you keep it in the same room that you sleep. Overall for the peace of mind it is worth it. It does keep you up to date with the latest minute details of the weather. The end result is that it is a great value.MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio"
2,After 3 years it quit receiving broadcasts from the weather channels,"If I turn it off for a while and turn it back on, it would receive the broadcast then gradually it goes silent. Tried different channels and rebooted several times none worked. Normally it would show expired warnings and tests but now all it shows is No Message. I'm now looking for a different model."
3,Not great,"You can not shut off the low level advisories without shutting them all off. In TN there is always a advisory for something, I do not want to be woken up for every little thing."
2,Terrible display,"There isn't a brightness control on the display leaving you only with the choice of on or off, and it is much too bright to leave on. The display itself is poor and difficult to read even when on."
2,Not what I needed,"Purchased to replace a 12year combo AM-FM clock radio with weather alert - this was a better unit, but the display was a bright blue with black characters - very poor contrast for these old eyes. The time numbers were so small I had to put on my glasses and get at just the right angle to see them. The LCD background was very bright, even at the lowest setting - it was like a beacon - each time I rolled over to face it in my sleep it would wake me! OK, so I'm picky, but this radio just did not fit what I needed."
2,Not user friendly,1. Time display is small and therefore makes it almost useless as an alarm clock. The year is displayed LARGE if you don't know what year it is. Da!2. The LCD is dim if not looked at strait on.3. Setting the time and all the functions is rather difficult and works different than the manual.Weather alerts work OK but don't know about overall reliability. Will probably return it or will just use it for weather alerts and forget about the time and alarm function.
3,This is a disappointment.,"Compared to our Midland WR 100, which finally bit the dust, this is a disappointment. It does not voice broadcast when there is an emergency, it only gives a digital read. Possibly we are not doing something right, but if that is the case, then the instructions are not easy to understand, which is not good. Voice quality is bad."
3,A Challenge to Program,"The radio was a bit of a challenge to set up and program with regard to date, day, time and for your correct local NOAA Emergency Radio frequency. And the reception was not that great either, but that is caused more by the geographic location, is not really the fault of the radio, and can be improved with an optional external antenna."
4,"Nice weather radio, but one big problem...","This is a nice weather radio. It lets you select which alerts will sound the alarm and in which counties. It also has battery backup and very good reception. However, there is a major flaw. There is no alarm for when it loses reception of your weather station. The very first storm that came through after I got my WR300 running knocked the local NWS radio off the air and I didn't receive the tornado warning they issued. Good thing I had the tv on at the time!Before I bought the WR300, I had tried a cheaper Radio Shack model that would alert you the minute it lost radio reception, but wouldn't let you select counties or alert types. I guess I just assumed more expensive models would have this feature, but that is not always the case.Just remember, it is not a newsworthy item when a NWS station goes off the air-the local news will not warn you nor the local radio or the police...so your weather radio is never 100 prercent reliable, even with battery backup."
3,Good Radio with Flaws,This is a good weather radio that does its basic job well. The radio is fairly easy to set up and reports weather alerts very well. The only issue that I have is the clock and radio dial is not easy to see and since it was designed to also be a clock radio this presents problems. Trying to see the time late at night is almost impossible. The clock radio function works well as you just have to set it to come on only once and it automatically comes on every morning at wakeuup time. You then press a button to silence it after you get up.
2,Tinny sound - 3 FM presets - good weather radio,"If you are looking for a weather radio with SAME, this is a good radio. If you are looking for a radio that also has an AM/FM radio with decent sound, this is NOT it. It sounds like a wimpy little transistor radio (for those that remember what that is). We returned it and will try an Eton FR600. Comments:- picked up our local weather station fine.- It was fairly easy to program SAME settings- included AC adapter nice to have- weather alert text (i.e. ""Tornado Warning"") goes away if you turn on radio, but warning/watch LED does stay on.- Would be a decent bedside clock radio if you are not interested in sound quality."
1,useless,"I've had this radio for a while. radio is too hard to program and it has to be reset every time you change battries etc. The way it ""works"" (and I use that term loosely), I can't tell if the various alarms are on or off.Further, even in downtown Stamford CT, the radio has major reception problems. It is therefore useless.Unfortuantely, the other SAME radios seem about as bad."
1,small buttons,NO reception in mountains- buttons way too small for seniors.NO reception in mountains- buttons way too small for seniors.NO reception in mountains- buttons way too small for seniors.
2,Wr300,I have this radio.The directions are confusing! I cannot get nearby radio stations and I don't know if the weather alert is working!The display shows chanel 4 but I don't know what that is.There is no way to check if it works.
1,Unreadable Display,"I bought this radio as a bedside clock radio with weather alerts. The display is a large blue screen with tiny characters which are only visible at certain angles. It is unreadable at any angle at night. The method of controls, for alarm setting, receiving weather broadcasts, etc. is very confusing. It is unsatisfactory in every way. I have procrastinated too long to return it, and have wasted $50 on it. Don't buy a gadget like this on the internet - see it in the store and pay a little more (or considerably less, for a clock radio) to have some idea what you're buying."
4,Great product,Radio was easy to set up and has performed great. recommended by a friend and I would pass on the recommendation.
5,Works Great,"I purchased this item because we rarely have the television on and I wanted to be warned of severe weather in the area, especially at night. I chose this model because I was able to narrow the alerts to set off the alarm only when there is a warning in one of two specific counties. I've been using it for about 2 months and it's worked great. I would highly recommend it."
3,Worked great while it worked.,"I purchased one of these in 2008. It worked great until hurricane Irene in 2011. The weather radio quit during the storm. It has not worked since - no weather radio, no alerts. Everything else on the radio works - clock, AM/FM radios, menu - just it's basic function stopped. It had a one year warranty and Midland charges a flat $45 to repair out of warranty. I'm deciding whether to take a chance on another one or go with a different brand."
4,Configurable and reliable,"I like this radio because I can choose which events alert me and which don't. In my case, I set mine to alert for tornado watch and warnings, but not flood warnings (for example). This is handy because, even with SAME, I was getting alerted for flood warnings in other parts of the county. I live on the top of a hill and don't feel the need to be alerted to flood warnings."
4,MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio,"Very good weather radio, easy to program only the countys that you wish to get alerts from and the type of alerts that you wish to receive. AM/FM radio reception is not real good. They have an error on page 12 of the owners manual that reads ""The above event codes notated with an asterick have a default setting to not sound the siren but only display a message and light the yellow LED when received"". They are aware of this error but have not fixed it in their on line manual or the manual that is sent with new orders."
3,Complicated,"Not easy to set up, I'm still not getting alerts I want like advisories, there doesn't seem to be a setting for that. I'm computer savvy but this was a pain to set up, and if you lose power and the batteries are weak or dead you have to set it up again."
2,Did not work,"Six days after this unit was activated there were 2 severe weather warnings and two Tornado warnings. The unit never went off.I tried to call Midland customer service to see if there was something I had overlooked but after 55 minutes on hold, I gave up and returned it.Amazon allowed the return with no problems. To bad Midland customer service doesn't work like Amazon!!!"
2,Nice features but...,"While this has nice features like a radio and the ability to switch the siren to a voice, the LCD makes it virtually unusable. The back light combined with black letters and numbering makes reading it at night very difficult to say the least. From just the right angle, you may be able to read what it says, but when you're in a hurry (like deciding to run to your basement) due to an impending tornado alert, the LCD renders the device useless. I would not recommend this unit to anyone with other than 20/20 vision."
5,Great Weather Radio!,I have had this radio for over two months and I highly recommend it! It gives over 100 weather related alerts and is loud enough to have stationed in the kitchen and hear up in the bedroom one floor up. Very accurate and it is Ray to set up and use. It is ranked as one of the top radios and is well worth the price!
4,Sleek and Compact,I like this weather radio. Ive been wanting one for a while. It is sleek and compact. It was fairly simple to get set up. It arrives set to recieve all alerts in your area (which is what I kept it at) or you can set it up for specific counties. I didnt have to read too much to figure out how to work it. there is a volume button and an instant weather button. You can also scroll through recent expired alerts. I'd give it a five star if the display was more vibrant.
3,Midland WR300 radio,"I got horrible reception with the radio. Granted the thing is ugly with the big antenna, but it still didn't pick up much for reception and I live in a major city. I had to go buy an external antenna for the radio but still it occasionally flashes (no signal). I've gone through the settings several times and it goes away but then comes back again. In retrospect I would have bought something I could easily return and get some assistance with. I'm not convinced this radio would go off in the event of a tornado. I guess I will rely on my windows shattering and roof lifting off my house alarm? Buy something with some customer support or something you can easily return/exchange."
1,Odor prevents use,"I received the radio yesterday and attempted to set it up, however, a strong chemical odor made me put it in the garage. The unit is small and attractive--I don't know how well it works. If the odor does not dissipate, I will have to return it."
1,Buy the less expensive one.,This radio worked fine till five minuites after Hurricane Wilma made landfall and then quit working.The electricity in my house was on so it was not a battery back up issiue.The less expensive one made by midland with S.A.M.E. is all you need and at the price difference you can buy two for one.This is not the unit to own. Too many useless features.It beeps every time a button is pushed.Do not waste your money !
3,A bit awkward interface.,"Seems like they didn't put too much thought into the interface. It seems it like came from the 90's. Other than that, still haven't had a chance to see how well it works."
1,"Piece of ""JUNK""",Bought two of these. Spent double the cost of the the WR120. Both did not work.Poor quality. Buyer beware.
5,Midland Weather Radio,The size and sensitivity of this unit is outstanding. The entire unit is user friendly for function and use.
3,Does this weather radio have a headphone jack?,Can anybody please tell me if this weather radio has a headphone jack? I would like to listen to it at times and not disturb others. ThanksMIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio
5,weather radio,Great radio. Works on battery or plug. Sounds alarm. Gives updates on button push. Select warnings and counties.
4,Tim's Midland,Nice compact and functional design. Set-up was easy. The weather hasn't allowed me an opportunity to experience it's total capability.
5,Midland WR-300 Weather Radio is a winner!,"This is my first weather radio and from reading the reviews, I chose the Midland WR-300. It offers features that I may never need, but then again, I may one day. And having the ability to operate from a portable location, and using the cars cigar lighter receptical for power, having the AM/FM broadcast bands, with weather alert break in, is a great feature. Also, having the option of adding an addition antenna, if needed, is also a plus. In recent days, this radio has been alerting us to bad weather before I hear about it on the broadcast and TV stations. I plan on buy my family this radio for gifts."
4,works as advertised,"No problems and works well. Sound is ok, but didn't purchase for HiFi quality. Live out of town and in ICF constructed house, reception still good, picks up NOAA alerts and weather statements fine."
5,My FIRST Line of Defense !,No one will beat the alerts by NOAA and this radio provides them. I have always depended on my weather radio's and I am very happy with this one. I can silence the weekly alarm because I work at night. I have fips codes for just my surrounding counties. I like the display that runs the type of alert. This will be the best thing you ever buy for yourself and your family...A NOAA Weather Radio..Do it now...
5,"Midland Weather Radio, great product",Very happy. Great product for weather radio. AM/FM a plus. I also like the capability of tuning into the local county for localized weather alerts.
4,Midland WR300 Weather Radio,"As the norm, great price, rapid delivery & it works great.Has souned an alert everytime watches or warning were sent.A lifesaver."
5,Excellent.,"Had one at work for my office before and was excellent. I am sure this one will be also. Have not had any reason for it to go off since I bought it as I only have it set up for Warnings at home. Oh well, an insurance policy."
1,Poor Quality,"Very disappointed in this product. I purchased the Midland WR300 thinking I was upgrading my old weather radio. Even though it was fairly easy to program, the clarity of the alerts and weather info was extremly hard to understand. Very garbled no matter where I positioned it in the house."
1,Doesn't last long under normal use,Had this 7 months. Now it just makes a loud whistle when I turn it on. No indication that it isn't actually doing its job waiting for an emergency other than when I try to turn it on manually.Tons of ppl having the same problem on msg boards. [...]Didnt keep the original packaging or recipt so they wont replace it.What a POS.I'll NEVER get another midland product because they put so many lives in danger all across the country with this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not What I Expecred,"We had a county wide tornado alarm test. This radio did nothing even though it was set up correctly. Good AM/FM radio and the weather station works but with an external antenna,(not included.) Since this radio did not work during the county wide test, I wouldn't trust it in a real emergency. It was returned. Purchased this item through Amazon and they were good at issuing a refund."
3,Just...ok,"Seems ok as a weather radio. I can tune to my station and enter my county's SAME code.As a clock radio, it has three fatal flaws:(1) The time is so small, you can barely read it unless you are an inch away from it(2) Every button you press emits a loud ""beep"" that can't be disabled(3) The screen has two brightness settings -- ""normal"" (only lights up if you press a button) and ""continuous"" (always lit up). However, the screen is bright enough to use as a flashlight, so continuous mode is not practical. It needs to have a dimmer option."
5,MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio,This Was Well Worth The Cost. Has A Very Loud Alert ( will wake You Up ) Alerts You 15 To 20 Minutes Before TV Or Radio. Were Very Happy With It
4,WR-300,"The reception is excellent as compared to a Radio Shack weather radio I already own. Programming the unit is fairly intuitive. However, the LCD display is somewhat small and suffers from poor contrast (blue backlight). The ultimate question is, ""Would you buy it again?"" My answer is yes."
2,Fair Radio,"Be careful on purchasing this clock radio. It has many features and is somwhat difficult to get it totally programmed. However, the worst part of this Clock Radio is that it has NO sleep capabilities. The radio is either on or off. If it is by your bedside and you like to have the radio on for an hour or so-it does not have that ability. So it is not a full functioning clock radio. That is very misleading. I wanted a NOAA alert radio by my bedside but have a clock radio, which I did not get. So beware on this item. The radio is ok but shoud not be advertised as a clock radio but rather a radio with a clock and that is it."
2,Receiver problems,Many aspects of the unit seemed good but I returned the one I ordered because in some locations in my apartment the radio received some type of commercial radio or TV signal. The audio coming from the radio was clearly not from a weather radio station. My older Radio Shack weather radio does not have this problem.
1,Worked for two years then....,"If I were to write this review at this time last year I would give the radio 5 stars. We had no issues at all with the set up or with how the radio functioned until this tornado season. While the radio continues to alarm for tornado watches it has FAILED to alarm for EVERY tornado warning we have had this year. This includes the Joplin EF5 on May 22, 2011 that touched down 3 miles from our house. Will be moving to a different brand as Midland no longer has the trust of this household."
5,Midland WR300,"Great product. I don't know how I got along w/o it before. Really keeps me informed about bad weather in my area, and the watches and warnings are really important to me. Especially the tornados alerts, watches, and warnings. For the price this is a must for people who live in areas with severe weather."
4,Posit,Good product and a step up over the WR-100. We bought this one because it has the features of only using the alert for which we were concerned about. We were awaken in the middle of the night previously for flash flood warnings in our county and we live no where close to that threat.We sleep much better and trust the technology
3,quirky function,"I can't say that I know how this will work long term because I will be returning it. I read alot of reviews online and liked the progammable features that this radio will give you. But what I didn't notice until I had it in my hands and was programming it is that for a tornado warning, the default is just to have a light, no sound. Another reviewer said that you have to add it, but how do you know it will sound? Very weird function of this, as I would think you would WANT an audible sound when the worst of the threats is near."
5,Alerted 20 minutes before the TV warning!,"Midland WR-300 AM/FM Weather/All Hazards/Civil Emergency Alert Monitor with S.A.M.E.is awesome. Last night it went off about 20 minutes before the TV broke in with a severe thunderstorm warning with hail! If there is a tornado, what good is a basement if you can't get there in time! This is a must have for all households, a small investment.Also, no false alarms. It has not went off at all until last night. You can decide which weather alerts to sound the siren, and which to ignore, etc. Very flexible and easy to use. Easy to hear all over the house as well."
1,"In 5 years in strom central Texas, never had 1 alert",We've had this model for over 5 years. Spent many hours configuring and testing the device. We've never have one alert from the unit through dozens of major storms and about 10 city tornado alerts. Totally useless device.
1,Avoid. Does not work,I have walked through the setup several times. Alerts do not work at all. Horrible documentation is no help troubleshooting. Go buy another companies product
1,Just Plain Won't Work,"After four months, not a single alert/warning ever. No lights, no siren. I've reprogrammed, moved to different areas of the house, gone back to the factory settings...radio simply will not give a warning. Radio and weather radio work, just will not alert.UPDATE: returned unit to factory (after talking to their tech support). Sent me a new unit...it works great. So, when it works I give it 4.5 stars."
3,Midland Weather Radio,"Radio and weather alerts seems to work fine - with crazy weather we have had a lot of alerts. There is a hidden alarm that goes off at 5:00 am if you don't know how to use.... and hence, my main objection. The instruction manual that came with the radio is very poor and I wasted a couple of hours trying to find things or just guess. They could provide a list of NOAA sites. Secondly, I suspect that the manual was outsourced and to a foreign country. Very poor. TO the point of not wanting to get another of their products.The company's support staff was very friendly and helpful, once I got to them"
4,Newbie,MIDLAND WR300 Weather RadioJust received this radio. Read the owner's manual. Programmed it in about 5 minutes. It's smaller than I pictured which is fine. Getting good reception. All is well. Hope it continues. Will give it 5 stars later if it alerts me to bad weather.
4,Weather Radio,"We bought this to replace a Model WR 100 which we had for several years and had quit for some reason. This model has much better reception, and clearer tone. We are about 50 miles from the Weather center that covers our county. It does take a little getting used to to know which buttons control the various functions, but with time that will come. We had severe thunderstorms last night and were kept well informed."
2,Waste of Money!,"I have had many Midland Weather Radios in the past and this by far has been the worst! It really isn't user friendly, it has HORRIBLE reception( keep in mind I have another weather radio in the same house and it picks up great reception) and has of bells and whistles that aren't good for much of anything, and this is one of their more expensive models! If you want a good reliable, less expensive model go with the Midland WR-120B. That unit is newer, easier to use and gets great reception."
1,Good but doesn't shutoff voice after an alert,"This radio works fine, and I like just about everything on it, except it doesn't shut off the voice at the end of an alert. So at 2am, when it goes off to tell you about a warning, the voice stays on for 5 minutes instead of automatically turning off when receiving the SAME EOM (End Of Message) tones. As much as I like this radio, this one problem is enough to make me toss it out and buy another one, so it gets the lowest rating.Other reviewers have said the same thing, and some have recommended theR-1630 All Hazard - Weather Alert Radio Reecomand theReecom R-1650 Weather Alert All Hazard Alert Radio with S.A.M.E and AM/FM Clock Radio(with AM/FM radio). Both support EOM according to their web site ([...]). I'll be trying them next.I also tried theFirst Alert Public Alert Radio with S.A.M.E, and I can confirm that it does support EOM, but mine died after only a few months. Otherwise it was a good radio, so you may have better luck."
2,UNRELIABLE,The radio is yet to sound an alert when one has been sent out. I know for a fact that an alert has been sent via another monitor.
4,Midland WR-300,"It seems to work OK, had it about 6 weeks. I can get 2 or 3 weather channels very cleraly. I have only received one alert since I have had it, from a neighboring county that I had programmed to receive. I've not received any from our county - have not had bad weather but I assume it will work. The user manual is very poor, the on-line help is not any better - be prepared for trial and error to learn how to use it. There is more documentation provided on how to use the AM/FM radio than there is on how to use the weather features. The AM/FM works OK too, but you can only pre-sent 3 stations for each, but that's OK since the main purpose is for the weather information."
4,Great radio,"It's been useful and works well. The radio reception is incredible. Other reviewers have stated the case well here. My only beef is that the ""alert"" warning can only be set to HIGH or LOW - some sort of medium would have been really great."
5,Good performer,"No complaints about this emergency radio. Comes pre-programmed for all local signals, and can be custom-programmed for stations of your choice. Lots of controls, but don't let all the little buttons intimidate you. Just plug it in and read the detailed instructions. Even plays conventional stations."
5,Mac,Easy to use. Great brand. Excellant service. Better than last two brands of weather radios. Nice styling. Many great feathers.
5,Great Weather Radio,"Boy this radio is just as presented..GREAT!! Some reviews downgrade it for the loud beeps it makes with pressing buttons. They are just normal sounds that are definitely not loud. Got it from Amazon in just 3 days. We keep it on constantly and if we want to hear the weather forecast, we just press the forecast button and waalaa, we got it. Highly recommend this to anyone. Don't go buy anything else. It's the #1 rated radio on Consumer Research."
1,Not what I expected...,"I bought the Midland Weather Radio because we live in a weather zone near ""Tornado Alley"" and I wanted the ability to receive weather alerts, particularly during the night while sleeping. Unfortunately this device is extremely difficult to program--if not impossible! Yes, you get weather alerts. But there is no way to stop getting them and they repeat every five minutes for infinity! Apparently you cannot receive only the changes in alerts--you have to be subjected to every repeat. The display is very difficult to read. We finally disconnected ours and threw it away!"
4,mostly happy with purchase,"only one complaint with the radio, when back lite is on, too bright, lights up the room. when back lite is normal, can't see the time at night. otherwise, very happy with the weather radio, met expectations."
5,Safety comes first,"I PURCHASED 5 OF THESE WR-300 MONITORS. 1 FOR MYSELF AND 1 FOR EACH OF MY 4 MARRIED CHILDREN. LAST YEAR MY DAUGHTER CALLED US AT 11PM TO LET US KNOW THERE WAS A TORNADO WARNING IN OUR AREA. MY WIFE AND MYSELF WERE SLEEPING AT THE TIME. WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND THE TORNADO TOUCHED DOWN 1 MILE FROM OUR HOUSE. THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL BUT GOT ME THINKING ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. WITH THIS MONITOR YOU RECEIVE WARNINGS AHEAD OF TIME EVEN IF YOU ARE ASLEEP. THIS MONITOR WILL WAKE THE MOST SOUND SLEEPER. SINCE I PURCHASED THESE MONITORS, MYSELF AND MY DAUGHTER HAVE BEEN AWAKENED TO THE ALARM FOR SERIOUS WEATHER AND A TORNADO. I RECOMMEND THIS MONITOR TO EVERYONE. EVERY YEAR THE WEATHER SEEMS TO BE CHANGING ITS NORMAL PATTERNS. YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON YOUR FAMILIES SAFETY. THIS MONITOR IS WORTH EVERY PENNY."
3,best and worst,"Best weather radio we ever purchased (we have had 3 others). Worst clock radio we ever had. If you ever need to change your alarm and you sleep with someone else - keep your current alarm clock. When ever you touch a button it will beep, to set/change the alarm set up you have go through several menu choices just to get to the alarm set up function. This equally lots of beeps."
3,michelle K Women's Harmony Slip-on,"I like the style and fit of the shoe. However, one small finishing detail is hard to overcome - the roughness of seaming of the leather trim at the heel rubs blisters. Deliberating giving oneself blisters when trying to break-in the shoes, doesn't make one enthusiastic about wearing them."
5,Strata Dragoon rocks!,Strata is very good. It's clutch levers push in or it just pushes it in by itself. Then the engine gear starts the game!
4,Come back Watson & Beasley,"One of the cuts on this album is called Dimensions -- it is absolutely incredible, a real precursor to the best of inspirational house music, although technically it doesn't fit in that category. I found this wonderful LP in a 2nds bins in the 80s, and spent many enjoyable hours singing along and dancing to it. What a talent these two were... I hope that they are still making music somewhere."
4,"Nice, Well Made","Bought this for the back of my Goldwing. and like other Nelson-Rigg luggage I own,This is well made, high quality..The only down side is my Show Chrome luggage rack over the trunk wont allow it to sit totally flat.Looking foward to using on a motorcycle trip soon!"
5,Better than orignal version,"Geri H. has done something rare...She has recorded a new version of old hit, but hers is heavens better than The Weather Girls' one!I had never been a huge fan of this classic, but after I heard Ginger Spice's version I fell in love with it. The moment you hear it you want to stand up and jump :)The maxi itself is perfect. You get 4 remixes, every of them as good as original. If you are looking for a dance anthem, don't hesitate and buy it.Geri rulezzzzzzzzzzzzzz :)"
1,"sad, souless, and sleepy","For those of us who love the engergy the original Weather Girls brought to this number, Geri's rendition is..well, lacking. It is truly unfortunate, because this singer is the same vocalist who brought us many memorable hits form the Spice Grils....Geri's impassioned vocal from the Spice Girls ""Wannabe"", for example, created high expectaions for me. In fairess, I can say that her singing is techincally accurate, albeit souless. The ONLY energy in this new cover is from the techno beat track. The snappy attitude from the original is missing. Cher was able to bring soul and energy to techno, and so was Madonna. Perhaps it is just a bad mixing job (but all of the tracks???) If you are looking for the same kind of energy, vereve, and snappy reverie from the original number, you will not find it on this recording...."
4,Pretty Solid Braves Cap,"My fitted Braves cap was getting worn out, so I bought this adjustable cap. The hat is okay, but my head is big so it doesn't come far enough down on my head for what I'm comfortable with. For the price though, a decent buy."
5,Nice Cap,It was a Christmas gift for my 90 year old father who never misses a Braves game on TV. It was well made and he really liked it..
5,Great cap,"Wanted something a 12 year old could grow with. This cap is great, it fits very well and has adjustable sizing to grow with. Good quality, seems to be standing up to the 12 year old."
1,"Disappointing cake -ring, not for perfectionists!","I am professional chef of French Pastries and I am disappointed with this ring. I used this ring to produce an extremely delicate cake called 'Mousse of Chocolate', so on the tender surface my cake's sides there were rough traces of clips, that are regulating the diameter of the ring. Professional cake-ring has to have a totally sleek shape without any clips on the interior surface..."
5,This CD belongs in every collection,"First of, moe. is such an amazing band. All of their albums, including this one, only prove that. This is one of the few CDs that I love every single track on it. I have to listen to the entire CD all the way through everytime I put it in the CD player. This is definitley one of my favorite CDs. I would have to say that moe. is the best jam band in the studio. Their studio albums are probably some of the best of their genre. However, on the other hand, they are mind blowing live. They jam beautifully and create an energy and vibe unlike any other. I love every moe. CD, but this might have to be my favorite. Anyone who has not heard of moe., please buy this CD. It is truly a gem."
4,moe. best album to date,"I've read in a lot of the reviews you have posted, that Tin Cans and Car Tires is better than this album. With all due respect to those who feel that way, you're nuts. Tin Can and Car Tires is good, but it doesn't have songs has good as Spine of a Dog, Buster, and Rebubula. This is by far moe.'s best album but, hey No Doy"
1,total let down,uninspired and down right boring. I feel I wasted over an hour of my life listening to this disc...
2,"Been there, heard that","I bought this CD after falling in love with moe.'s Tin Cans and Car Tires. It's not 1/2 as good. Too many dorky jam band cliche's! The 13 minute song the extesive bass solo, the Synyrd-type guitar playing. I am a fan of the Grateful Dead, Blues Traveler, Dave Matthews Band, the Freddy Jones Band, Guster ect. I've heard all of the stuff moe. does again and agian on this CD. The only two songs that match the material on Tin Cans and Car Tires are Spine of a Dog and Moth."
5,killer CD,I love this CD. Moe did a great job with this studio album even though their jammed out style caters more towards live performance. St. Augustine is one of my favortie songs. 32 Things is very well written and has a live feel to it. All the songs are well done even though the frist half of the album is my favorite. The only problem with this CD is the lame cover art which I really don't like. This CD serves as a great intoduction to Moe.
5,If you miss Zappa...,"These boys love their guitars. Wonderful songwriting and superb production.(Wish Porter had been on board for Tin Cans). If the ending of Buster don't get you, nothing will. This album was all I could listen to for nearly a year. Think of the last time you put on a CD and didn't have to skip tracks to get to the good stuff. This is it. A masterpiece."
4,Catch 'em in the small venues while you can!,"Flat out Moe. is on the way up. If you were excited at all about Tin Cans you will be thrilled with a purchase of No Doy. It is without a doubt the best organized, and yet fluid CD they have put out to date. I love Headseed, but No Doy reigns superior."
5,"Pragmatic, Insightful, and Results-oriented","This is what I found useful reading the book:1. The book lets you know what to expect in M&A and Transitions.2. It lets you gain insights on economic value creation, and teaches you to focus on the bottom-line.3. It provides a clear framework for communications at different levels to different stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders, regulators, vendors, et al.)4. It also sensitizes you to potential competitive threats during the critical period of transition.5. It virtually hands you a launch plan for transition, but with enough insights via stories and incidents that you can adapt it; and learn multidimensionally. (e.g., What would I do when two of my competitors merge?)The authors' communication is lucid, ideas are pragmatic and insightful, and the focus is on the bottom-line. READ THIS FIRST!"
5,Wonderful book! Buy it and read it!,"I have been involved with mergers and acquisitions from the Human Resources point of view for many years. This is the best and enjoyable book I have ever read on the subject. The book is funny and well thought out. A short, concise, practical way to view the M&A process. If your company is planning a merger or acquisition or is even thinking about one, read this book."
3,For the big boys,"I am a small business owner. I got this book because I was doing a merger with another small business. This book was written for large corporations. While I did find many of the principles applicable to my specifics, I would suggest another book for small business owners."
3,"Good information, questionable presentation",The book deals well with the subject but its style is cumbersome while trying to be funny.
2,"Field Guide ""Lite""","Lots of catchy anecdotes, but light on actually implementing the ""Accelerated Transition"" principles, despite the ""field guide"" description. Most of the recommendations are obvious and wellworn--for example, constant communication with stakeholders. Almost feels like a teaser for their consulting services. Not worth the money...skim it at the bookstore."
3,more sizzle than steak,"The premise is great and Mark Feldman is really bright but the execution doesn't cut it. Five Frogs is sort of like ""who Moved My Cheese?"" for integration practitioners. The difference is that CEOs and senior managers looking for substance and guidance not fluff will be gravely disappointed. In it's quest to be entertaining, the book loses its substance. The tone and content of this book are more appropriate for junior managers or junior high school. In terms of message: Five frogs feels like it was excerpted from the culture section of ""Winning at Mergers & Acquisitions"" by Clemente and Greenspan. That book dedicates an entire section to integration and places organizational change in a more real-life context. Another book that speaks to the reader clearly about culture change without the need for fables or fantasy is ""Leading Organizations through Transition"" by Deetz, Tracy and Simpson. Five Frogs on a Log is more sizzle than steak."
2,"Long on opinion, short on facts","I found this book entertaining in terms of the anecdotes they use to illustrate their points. However, I was deeply disappointed with the degree of conviction they maintain based primarily on a data sample of a little more than 100 firms. That compares to more than 30,000 transactions globally in a normal year. I find it difficult to have much confidence in their conclusions. I find it annoying that author's often seem to promote either their agenda, their firm, or a particular point of view by using either data that tends to support their conclusions or a sample that is too small to be meaningful. Nonetheless, if you are interested in being entertained, this book is for you...howerver, if you are interested in some modicum of rigor, you need to look elsewhere."
5,Suzuki Outboard ~Seloc Svc Manual,"This was my first experiance @ AMAZON. I'm happy to say it was a pleasent one. Both Amazon & the Seller were reliable. The product was advertized as used; yet it was received in 100% condition.The SELCO Service Manual is well arranged & a very good layout making it easy to follow & find what you're looking for. (This is my first dealing with Selco also).Overall experiance: I'll be back and if in need of another service manual in the future, I'll definatly look up on Amazon & look for Selco manuals."
2,not as good as claim,"I purcahsed a pontoon with a 1990 Suzuki 150. I purchased the Clymer manual first. It doesn't cover everything and covers too many years and models in one book. I found an OEM Suzuki manual ($70) that made huge claims. It was worse than the Clymer manual. I guess it was designed for a certified Suzuki mechanic. I then decided one more try. I purchased this manual and it is not as good as the Clymer manual. The pictures, detailed disassembley and reassembly, etc.. are not near as good."
2,Where's the cuctomer service?,I've had the product for two years and trying to upgrade gets no response through customer service. I'm using ContentBarrier to keep the krap off my kid's computer. Just remember that video streaming can't be selective.
1,Please stop writing,Please stop leading people astray. Your first book was based on incorrect data. Now you seem to be apoligizing for the church. It would seem to me that a true beleiver would not need such symbols or traditions. Besides most of the bible teaches against the use of such.
1,Is this really necessary?,"Yes, there are big errors in The 2 Babylons, but Mr. Woodrow didn't completely understand The 2 Babylons in the 1st place, so how can he write an honest criticism of it? Mr. Woodrow is known for making illogical conclusions anyway. I have little respect for his mentality and scholarship."
2,Save your money - skip this book,"If you read ""Babylon Mystery Religion"", which I did, don't bother reading this book. The author simply goes through each detail in the first book, and then refutes it. I kept reading, hoping to find some information that would justify the first book, but I didn't find anything.Bottom line - just disregard everything you read in the first book, and save your time reading this one."
1,The evidence speaks for itself...,"I have read much literature on this subject and I have to question ANYONE that thinks the Catholic church is in anyway endorsed by God... on the contrary.What more evidence does one need?It is a historical fact that the Catholic church ""butchered"" an estimated 50 million protestants during the dark ages. (Read Foxe's Book of Martyr's"")Pope Pius X was once quoted as saying ""the FABLE of Christ has brought me great wealth""Unfortunately, 1000 words is not enough to prove the utter error of this work... you were right the first time Mr. Woodrow"
1,Smooth Things?,"Isaiah 30:10: Who say to the seers, Do not see, and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things; speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits. NKJVI guess being in the Hot Seat finally got to Mr. Woodrow. He dismisses all the truth he once spoke of as bad research based on faulty premises.Now, so everyone will like him, he has decided everything is wonderful let's not be judgemental.Is there anyone out there still left who will still speak the truth? It's truly a sad day when teachers of truth turn back to the lies they once exposed.This book is the work of a Catholic apologist. It's a good book for anyone who wants to continue hearing the LIE."
1,Buy This Book,if you want to see how the Catholic Church creates doubt in people's minds through ridicule and illogical arguments. The simple fact is that they got to Woodrow. But unfortunately for them the truth is sure hard to rub out. Forget about all the silly arguments made back and forth. Anyone who wants to learn of the truth on the matter has to simply pick up any older encylopedia and look up the subjects for themselves.
1,Confusing and misinforming,"I was not impressed with this book. I was so disgusted by Woodrows claims that I couldn't even continue reading. He totally puts down Hislops research. Some people just refuse to see the truth. Others will be misled if they continue reading false doctrine by uneducated authors. Idol worship is an abomination before God/Elyon! The Catholic church and religion is very corrupt. God did not create these man-made holidays. These holidays were created to mislead everyone. Unfortunately, some have fallen into this trap. Do your reesearch before allowing yourselves to be brain washed by mans traditions(pagan) and beliefs."
1,Raph Woodrow: Influenced by the Great Whore of Rev. 17,"I read his first book and also read a preview of his latest book...Sadly, his refutes are at times based on pictures. For example, he critizes Hislop's book for displaying one picture of a blonde haired woman with a black baby and dismisses it as just a myth with no real pagan connection....Baal worship or sun worship was intergrated into various cultures at various degrees and at various times throughout history. So it wouldnt be that uncommon to have a mother/child religion (baal worship) displayed in a mixed manner or in a variant manner...Also there is another thing, Woodrow may have been too focused on the first book that Roman Catholicism was the only religion with the pagan connection calling itself ""Christian""...Revelation 17 reveals more than one religion has the pagan connection, but the ""mother"" is Rome...So I believe after 35 years or more he began to be influenced by the Great Whore and also by dispensalism."
2,Not the Helmut Lotti I was looking for....,"This production is a disapointment to me and others with whom I have shared it. There is none of the exictement and vigor found in his ""goes classic"" productions. Helmut comes off as a poor imatation of Elvis doing 'romantic' songs, none of which I have ever heard. Such a shame for a potential world class performer to release this CD. I will continue to buy his work but really hope he sticks to the more vigerous and vibrant music. Thatis where he excels and what we want some more........."
1,"Not at all like Helmut Lotti's ""Classic"" recordings",I was very disappointed with this recording. Helmut Lotti is a very dynamic and talented singer. This recording does not show him at his best.
3,Album does not use his voice to it's fullest,I waited for so long for this album and am a little disappointed in it. He has such a beautiful voice and this album does not do it justice.
5,Best of the best. Fabulous,Helmut Lotti is so fantastic that he brings tears to my eyes. I could listen to him forever. Even my grandchildren have a copy. They all love him. I saw him in Belgium and I cannot stop raving about his unbelievable voice and personality. I hope he soom comes to America so I can meet him. My family all love him.
2,TWISTED TWAIN,"Any fan of Mark Twain's writing will be appalled at what this particular Disney version has done to it. This one takes liberties with the classic characters never before dared. A perfect example of the complete disregard for Twain's authentic sense of time and place is the laughable fact that neither Tom or Huck ever once are seen barefoot, an absolute hallmark of the characters! The old David O. Selznick production is far superior!"
5,I LOVE IT!,"This movie is GREAT! I totally love it. I am 15, and my friends and I are really big JTT and Brad Renfro fans and we watch as much as we can whenever we can! It has wonderful people playing the characters, and they both look so cute in the video! It is a must see! :-)"
1,A viewer from New York,"This film is hard to recommend. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is grossly miscast in this film. Disney should have put effort into developing a decent script rather than trying to showcase one of their popular stars! It lacks the charm and wit of the novel and JTT is not a bit believable as Tom. He is a talented actor, don't get me wrong. But he has no business playing Tom Sawyer. Too much of his attitude from his Home Improvement character comes through. Brad Renfro is acceptable as Huck, but nothing to cheer about. Disney relied too much on popularity and sacrificed believability here.... ."
5,I loved it,"I loved this movie and so do my brothers we just had to buy it(well we got it off the t.v. so it didn't have any swear words) and for those people who are complaining because of the bad words get a sensor or something. I think the charachters did a great job. We couldn't help laughing when the funny parts came. And for Rachelle Cook:you go girl (e.g pushing Tom in the creek)I think that this is one of my favorite movies.We are actually watching it right now! It is just a nice family movie with some comedy,adventure,and true love. Well i gotta say if you are a Disney fan and you like good family movies I would definitly tell you to see this one. And good job on your movie Rachelle, Jonathon, and Brad it was great."
4,Movie is great but this is a Full Screen format,"I was a little irked with myself when I got the dvd and realized it was in full screen format. Most of us now have widescreen TVs, but there are still a lot movies still out there in full screen. My fault I didn't check, but I'm not completely happy with this purchase. Four stars is because I loved the movie, but not the purchase."
2,not a family friendly movie,"This movie was ok, I will give it the fact that it had a good plot probably because it was based on a book and the cast chosen was well put together but I would never show this to children I think that adults have no business watching something like this.It had foul language the words would not stop coming and from the kids no less, also there was partial nudity. all in all I was very, very disappointed."
3,Good movie,I loved being able to share this movie with the next generation. I needed a few good and fun movies to show on a weekened babysitting and this was a great one. It's a good care free story based on the classic novels and all ages can enjoy. It even sparked the interest in my nephew enough that he started to read the books
3,Cast not too good; hardly good for kids,"Rachael leigh cook as Becky Thatcher? Not too good, unless it was someone other than JTT to play Tom Sawyer. BTW, JTT was the appropriate cast for Tom Sawyer. The 1973 version seems better w/ Jodie Foster, Johnny, and Jeff."
2,Far Away from the Actual Novel,I was trying to show this movie to my students after reading the Adventures of Tom Sawyer. But the movie events didn't match the novels'.
4,Too Bad Chris Noth is in so many of them...,"I've been waiting for ""ALL"" of them to come out... Its a SHAME ""NOTH"" has to be in soooo many of them.. I think he is in half of them. He adds ""nothing"" to the show..Now, ""Bobby"" is a character I ENJOY IMMENSELY... I think I'm going to enjoy""Jeff"" almost as much..."
1,LAW AND ORDER:CRIMINAL INTENT,"I AM DISGUSTED ! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR LAW AND ORDER:CRIMINAL INTENT SESONS 4,5,6, AND 7 TO COME OUT FOREVER !! CUT THE WAITING TIME ALREADY!I AM GETTING VERY FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY--DON'T YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY ? BRING ON VINNY, BABY ~!~CHRISTINA HIGGINS"
5,Power supply to operate D. C. V. window shades,The remote circuit boards on these electrically driven window shades failed and they had to be converted to a directly wired system. This power supply worked verywell for this application through a simple switch setup to operate the blinds.
5,Dake Annotated Reference Bible,This is the third Dake Ref. Bible I have purchased. They make great gifts fo those who want answers that are not easily found in scripture. I would not want to be without my Dake Bible.
5,Awesome!,The book came shrink-wrapped and in excellent condition as advertised. This Bible is a great study bible for serious students of the Bible. Be ready to see the author's conclusions.
5,Bought for a religious friend,"Bought this for a friend to replace her other bible, which was very old and getting ripped at the seams. I hadnt realized the bible was going to be the size of a text book though! My fault for not reading the dimensions. My friend enjoyed the book and uses it often. She loves the large print because her old bible had very small font."
5,Dake Annotated ReferenceBible King James Version Large Print,This has got to be one of the very best books that I have ever purchased. It is easy to read and understand. Loaded with extras to make studying the bible a pleasure. This is one of the best gifts that can be given to a person that wants to learn more about the word of God.
5,Awesome,"I love my Bible because of large print. I have a regular size Dakes; however the small print starting to affect me. Plus, I got a good deal for the large print."
1,Avoid the disappointment,I bought this program when it came out and when it was working it was quite good. However it did not take long and the first disc and all of the lessons on the first disc were inaccessible. I bought the program a second time thinking it might have been a fluke disc but I found out it was no fluke I had the same problem with the second disc as I had had with the first. To bad it was a pretty good learning tool. I would not buy this again.
3,Taijiquan theory of Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming; The Root of Taiajiquan,"Too technical in nature for someone who is seeking clarity in the practice of Taiji Quan. Since I do not read Chinese, it is useless for me."
4,worth getting,"Have not read all of it, but what I have read is good. It is a good book for beginners, as well as, for advanced students; very helpful information."
3,Her weakest import.,"It's Raining Men by Geri Halliwell is a nice cover of the Weather Girl's classic disco song. The disappointment with this import is the b-side track, Brave New World. That song is sooooooo boring and pointless, no wonder it wasn't put on the LP record. Sorry Geri but this import is a dud."
3,Love the look,"Love the look of these Beverly Feldman shoes, but they run a bit small. I had to squeeze my foot in them, in hope they stretch out. I love them so much I'm willing to endure the pain until then."
4,4 stars,I like this album solid beats all the way through good lyrics I just wish they hadn't fallen like they did but everybody thats been on top 4 a long time will fall no diss because the Wu held it down from 93 to seem like about 99 they are one of my favorite cliques....anyway add this to your Get list
2,WHaTsd All THE HyPe AbOUT,"YO i Dont get it.....why does every1 like this cd. it is basically horrible. the only thing stopping me from givin g it 1 star is ""Winter Warz"" and ""all that i got is You"" the rest of it is horrible. the beats are repetative, the lyrics dont do anything for me. dont get me wrong wu tang is phat but ghost is lackin on this one. it could have been a lot better. maybe ""Supreme Climinte"" will prove itself to be better."
2,i don't get it,"this cd is not all dat....the only thing making it worth anything is ""assasination day"" which is one of the best tracks i've ever heard...liquid swords and the 36 chambers kick this cd's bootay..."
5,One of the best Wu CD's ever....,"This album is straight fire! Personally, I think Ghostface is one of the better rappers of the Wu-Tang Clan and this debut album explains why. This is what you get here: typical hot Wu-style beats and Ghostface at his best. Ghostface is known for his quickly-spit, off-the-wall lyrics and that's what you get here. Ironman, along with Liquid Swords and Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, are the solo albums that proved Wu was for real. These 3 albums pretty much solidified their spot in hip-hop history.I think every track is hot here, especially 260, Winter Warz, Fish, All That I Got Is You, Wildflower & Iron Maiden. Thos are just my favorites off this album. I don't feel the need to ever skip any songs.If you have heard any Wu-Tang albums, and you enjoyed Ghostface, than this album is for you. All I can say is, if you don't get a copy of Ironman, you are definitly missing out."
5,AMAZING,Anyone who gave this CD obviously doesnt respesct hip hop in one of its purest forms. All tracks deliver pure satisfaction and Its another must have wu clan member must haveWU TANG FOREVER
5,CLASSIC.,This LP is nuts. If you like hip hop and don't have this record then you don't really like hip hop ;)
3,Space Ghost From Coast To Coast,"Just as Terminator X was Public Enemy's secret weapon, The RZA is The Wu-Tang Clan's: While other members get all the attention, producer RZA, quietly working behind the scenes, has been the force behind Wu-Tang's raw, all over the map, Bruce Lee-meets-Gladys Knight sound.RZA has done it again on Ghostface Killah's Ironman, arguably the best of the group's ""solo"" albums to date. Attacking from all angles, Ironman is classic Wu-Tang, piecing together Al Green and Jackson 5 samples, gospel choruses, kung fu soundbites and piano vamps into something unpredictable and vital-sounding.With guest rappers like Method Man, Raekwon and U-God on virtually every track, it may as well be a Wu-Tang album. There's even a ballad with Mary J. Blige, on which Ghostface Killah raps, ""Word up, Mommy&#151;I love you."""
4,Off Thah Books,If you don't like this CD you don't appreciate real hip-hop in its purest form that's all I got to say.... Peace!
4,Ghostface CD is da bomb!,"This CD is one of the best CD's I've heard from in a while. I knew the CD would be good, but I never thought this CD would be the kind I would listen to everyday. Don't take my word for it, listen to the thing. Long live Ghostface!!"
4,if you love wu-tang you will love this album,"This is a great album, Ghostface Killahs debut solo album, and his best.I like all the tracks, up until the last 6, the album just falls apart for some reason, but my brother likes the whole album.It has production from RZA at his best. The vocals are different from earlier Wu-tang albums, maybe due to different microphone and equipment.Ghostface isnt on every song, and fellow group member have some of there most memorable verses on this album.its barely a solo album due to all the guest appearances.This is an awesome, awesome album, up until the last few tracks in my opinion, but you might like the whole thing."
1,Baby boring not baby bowling,My son has no interst in this toy. he has never played with it once...the only thing he likes to do is throw the pins!
4,You'll Get A Grin.,"This import of Smile Like You Mean is not all new material.It has 3 tracks.Track 1 is Smile Like You Mean It, track 2 is Change Your Mind, and track 3 is Mr.Brightside-The Lindbergh Palace Remix.If you have already bought Hot Fuss, it is not really important that you buy this CD.The only reason to buy it is probably the remix of Mr.Brightside,which is pretty good. On an end note I would say this CD is only for big fans of the band and if you have Hot Fuss, you won't be missing anything really."
4,Good book,"For a good introduction to immunology, getting into some detail without confusing it;'s a good book. Not a bible of immunology but if you were after brushing up on this topic, or after learning about aspects of immunology then I think this is a nice book."
1,A disaster,"Unless you are already an expert in Immunology, keep away from this book. The text is EXTREMELY difficult to follow. The organization of the topics, for me, is everything but logical. The book has many colorful diagrams, but I found them confusing and hard to understand."
5,Excellent,"This book is a must-have if you are a fan of the Scarred Lands setting, being chocked full of information about not only the divine avatars and the titans, but demigods as well. It also introduces the notion of Divine Heralds and Pages, the more potent servitors of the gods. Interspersed with the text about the gods are several major and minor artifacts with a backstory and indicators of the roles they have placed in the world. Perhaps most impressive, however, are the several new divine spell domains presented. These are an excellent addition, and are useful for rounding out the powers of clerics and gods in other campaign settings. In all, I strongly recommend this book; it is very well written, the art is excellent, the material is absolutely imperative if you run a Scarred Lands game, and much of the content is useful even to other campaign worlds."
3,"Nice book, great drawings, lots of information... but...","As I always say, why do we need the stats of a divine creature that must miles away from even the most powerful pc? The info about the pantheon, the story, the tales about the titanswar, well, they're just great, but reducing a god to a sheet filled with numbers it's just like making him mundane and falible. A great book and a greater weak point."
1,Release Date does not Match Tape Creation Date,"I am totally displeased with this product. First the release date made me believe that this product was released in 2004 when in actually it was a corporate video probably made in 1994!!! There is no mention of any current operating systems since this tape was made before Windows95!!! It is totally out-of-date!!! Second Amazon charged $10 over the amount charged by EVN (Free shipping my backend). And finally I found spelling mistakes and concepts that don't apply for today's computers. A waste of time, a waste of money, and totally useless. Other than that it was packaged nicely."
2,Not as great as first two.,"I was disappointed by this final Gatekeeper Trilogy book. The first two books are two of the best books I have ever read, and this didn't have as much action, and, in my opinion, too much focus on Buffy's mother (who I really, really despise...) It is, however, pretty necessary, and a nice ending to the trilogy."
3,Difficult to remember all the plots,"With everything running around, from the Minotaur to the Ghost roads and Xander being the Gatekeeper to Il Maestro and then the demon at the end...I almost had to write everything down! I liked that Xander had some power...that was cool. The book was okay...if you've got nothing else to do and some money...I recommend the trilogy."
4,Third of the best,"Fantastic. Apocalyptic. Furious battles. Tense situations. I'm reading it for the second time and it's even better then the first. I know what's going to happen, yet I can't wait."
4,"A great book, but a little too much","You know, in this book there was alot going on. I mean, first of all thay had to get Jacques back to the Gatehouse, and they had to free Buffy's mom from the maze and the Minotour. And Xander becoming the Gatekeeper!?!? Then there was Belphegor and Il Maestro, and the Sons of Entropy, and then Ethan shows up. Then the whole deal with the Ghost Roads and Otherworld was alot. If you ask me, they should have to just focus on one thing: keepin hell in its place, not in Sunnydale. But like I said in the first place, it was still and awesome book!"
4,Awesome book!,"The book was the last in a wonderful trilogy. I'm glad Oz finally got some spotlight in these. My only faultline is that Oz spent too much time as a werewolf and not enough as his human self. Plus, Buffy didn't seem to get a lot of action this time. But, it was still an awesome book!"
5,THE BEST BUFFY BOOKS YET!!!,"Oh, my gosh! The Gatekeeper Trilogy is the most entertaining series of books of all the Buffy books!!! I love the way the authors included all the characters instead of just focusing on Buffy all the time. I thought it was cool how, in the last book they brought Belphegor, Il Maestro,and The Sons Of Entropy together at the end and finished them off. It was just totally entertaining. I loved how they had Xander become the Gatekeeper, I never expected that, I really thought he was gonna die! This trilogy is definetely a MUST for all Buffy fans!!! It will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning 'til end!!!!"
5,Baptiste Power of Yoga with Sherri Baptiste Freeman,"I LOVE THIS VIDEO! I am new to the Yoga world, this video was very accessible and rewarding. Practicing this video gives me a true workout and makes me feel amazing afterwards. I Recommend this Video."
4,Great Fun!!!(Though perhaps not great art.),"This is one of the few movies that I enjoy watching over and over again. I never come away enlightened, but I always come away entertained.Bacon and McGovern are delightful, and the supporting cast is perfect. Hughes isn't shedding any real light on the soul here, but he has created a brilliant diversion. Plus, any movie with a full-length Kate Bush song is a winner."
4,Perfect for a vegging out,"Your typical ""impending fatherhood"" romantic comedy with some rather amusing and slightly surreal visuals. Nice star turns by Kevin Bacon (and I thought the only comedy he did was Friday the 13th!) and Elizabeth McGovern. Alec Baldwin gives a great performance as the typical single-best-friend-whose-friends-are-all-married character--somehow he manages to keep it a realistic portrayal and not a charicature. Despite the annoying John Hughes habit of ""insert obligatory highly-charged dramatic moment here"" manipulation, the film reamins a nice, entertaining bit of fluff."
5,Straight From NYC,"Saw this movie repeatedly and I still love it. Be sure to watch the credits at the end when all the 'Cheers' cast are trying to name the baby! Ultimately, they pick the cool name. . .Chris."
2,"Clichéd, sexist, classist piece of trash","I can't believe all the positive reviews for ""She's Having a Baby."" I remember seeing it when it was originally released and being rather unimpressed, but I find it even worse upon watching it again in 2013. Most John Hughes' films have not held up well over the years. This film in particular comes across as inauthentic and filled with every ridiculous sexist cliché that was already outdated in 1988, let alone in 2013. Two stars only for having a good late-1980s soundtrack (though the film suffers from soundtrack overkill at times. Kate Bush's ""This Woman's Work"" during the childbirth scene? Really, Mr. Hughes?). On a brighter note, it does feature a young Alec Baldwin at the height of his man beauty."
3,She's Having a Baby,"Purchased this for a friend whose daughter is having her first baby. Understood it may be arriving from the UK if not in the US. 2 weeks later, got DVD that was not compatible with our DVD's here in the states - luckily, she was able to watch on her computer. Next time - give a heads up."
4,Movie Disappeared!,"I downloaded the movie and never got to watch it. Unfortunately, you only have a 24 hour window. I do have a hectic life, so I missed the window. I love the movie especially Kevin Bacon. I seen the movie when it was released in the 80s. It is funny in some parts and sad at the end. In my opinion it is well-written and worth the $2.99. It is a feel-good movie. Order it. You will enjoy it. Remember to watch it before the 24 hour window closes!"
4,Cute story!,"I rate it a 4 for the humore involved, and how much growing up couples have to do before they become parents."
5,"fantastic soundtrack, too","love this film. as i have reached the ripe old age of thirtysomething (no, don't get me started, I hated that show but cannot resist the anachronism) and am now married with 3 kids, it is just so funny to watch this movie again and relate to/get angry with the characters. been there...done that...and admittedly will probably do it again (and again)."
4,Zany Fun,"This story follows two young people who get married and whose lives do not go as they planned. They had great plans but find themselves in the ""real"" grind of life trying to make a living. He wants to be a great writer but has had to settle for a job writing ad copy. They also have to deal with in laws who prove to be a sore trial. He is worried about making ends meet and she is worried about having a baby.Many of the situations depicted in this film are only mildly laughable in and of themselves. What makes this film fun is the way they are depicted from the point of view of the man with a lot of imagination thrown in for good measure. What is shown on the screen is not what happens but what he daydreams/has nightmares about. Sometimes this is as subtle as rearranged marriage vows and sometimes it is an over the top musical song and dance number with the neighborhood lawn mowers.This is not art, it is just fun."
1,the editor is a liar,Can you believe it? The editor made the data even in the peer-reviewed paper. Can you image it? How can you value the book that he or she edited?
1,I'm not impressed,"I love egg decorating in all styles and have many books on the subject. This book however, was very disappointing. It really didn't have any project that appealed to me and I will probably be donating it to my local library."
3,Descent,"I've put off seeing this movie because Julia Stiles does nothing for me-and she still doesn't, but the distraction from supporting cast balances her out. Plot wise: anyone who's old enough to remember Flashdance will experience a sense of deja vu. The character's are just younger. There's no real obstacles to overcome-everyone just need to learn to get out of their own way. Which is usually the case in real life as well. This is not a bad movie. It will entertain you if you have nothing better to do at two in the morning."
3,"Pretty good, it has it's downfalls","I think this movie was good. You can tell that Julia doesn't have the most dancing experience. But she is still great. I thought the story was kind of average and not as believe-able It was a good movie and I liked it, rent it, see what you think."
3,Follow Your Dreams,"After the accidental death of her mother, Sara Johnson's (Julia Stiles) dreams of becoming a professional ballerina are decimated and she is forced to move from her quiet Vermont town to her father's ghetto apartment on the south side of Chicago. But when she meets Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), a popular black student with a passion for hip hop and a future brighter than his troubled past, her repressed ambition and sorrow are released through a revitalized interest in the cathartic and expressive power of dance. Overall, this wasn't a bad movie. I wouldn't rush out to rent it but it was alright."
4,great film,THis film was well done. The actors in this movie were great and the dance scences were cool and the music was hot. This movie is worth owning and you wont be dissapointed. YOu can watch it over and over and will not be tired of it.
3,Nothing spectacular,"Sort of ho-hum. Too predictable. I don't care for Julia Stiles acting at all. Thomas was good as was his sister. I watched it with my teenaged daughter. My attention was held, but I found myself saying thank goodness when it was over."
1,Very offensive,"I found Save the Last Dance to be very offensive. Its pounded heavily with bad attitude, violence, profanity, sensuality, and freak dancing (the guys and girls body touch very closely and very sexualy) when dancing. Its so disgusting.I don't understand why any teens would want to waste their time watching this dirty movie. Mtv is responsible for bringing this dirty romp to the big screen and I'm sorry that I ever saw it. It may come across as the story of dancing and romance, but its not. Its misrated and an R rating would have been more appropriate for this movie.This is a filthy movie, and shouldn't be seen by anyone."
1,Making a trip to the dawn!,"I definitely tired when the people do this kind of stuff. And think they can get the cheese before the mice, that bother me a lot, I so hard, but since I'm not making a copy-cat of another comercial of a quality product, like those crazy bees, Gosh I hate those utterly insane bees but I absoultley concur about the made statement a week before about the problems of you can have if you think milk is the solution to the problem, I know Albama is a great place but I think it will get more overrated with that poor scale made by sea people."
4,good hearted movie,"Who doesn't like this movie? It's an oldie, but goodie! I had this when it came out on VHS, but since that day has come and gone, I recently added it to my Roku collection. I colorful love story."
5,what a great movie,i love this movie and the whole plot and everything and i advise anyone every one nomatter what race or color get this movie and enjoy.
2,"Nice plot, bad acting","OK, I watched it since it was hyped so much. I was dissapointed by all the swaring and fighting. I thought this was supposed to be a movie about different styles of dancing. If you want teen drama then I guess this could be for you. If you're looking for something about a young dancer trying to make it, this isn't it."
1,GAG!!! Full of Stereotypes!!! Just Plain Stupid!!! GAG!!!,"I hate this movie with a passion. A blond girl moves to the ghetto and her black boyfriend helps her to regain courage to dance. OMG!!! Somebody save me. This movie was full of stereotypes. Stiles' best friend, a black teenage mother. The black females in the movie were either portrayed ghetto ready to fight girls or teenage mothers. It's very offensive. This was seriously a yawner, especially watching stiles trying to do the dances. The guy's acting was boring too. I couldn't believe his acting. yawn yawn yawn."
4,I Really Liked It!,"This was very good! It mixed romance, friendship, comedy, and dancing into an entertaining movie. The dancing was fantastic, and the acting was great, too! Julia Stiles was very good as Sara, a seventeen-year-old girl who dreams of being a ballerina, but ends up learning a lot about hip-hop, as well. This movie doesn't quite make my ""favorites"" list, but it comes pretty close! I really liked the fact that more than one story was going on at once, but they worked together to make one big story! I recommend this movie to teen girls, especially those who love to dance. I say ""teen"" girls because there is a lot of cussing and some teen content that isn't appropriate for all girls. But to those who are allowed to watch PG-13, and love teen movies, I highly recommend this!"
5,film of the year,"By the title it doesnt seem too convincing to watch this film but oh my god, this film was a masterpiece.Julia Stiles as one of the main character here.This film is full of comedy, dancing and romance.Its up there on my 10 faveroute movies list.It is defenitly for me the film of the year.This fantastic will get you upbeat and you will be dancing on the edge of you seat."
1,Bad Acting 101,"The story was good, but the acting was hideous. Julia Stiles performance was as pathetic as Keanu Reeves in 'A Walk in the Clouds'. She was not very convincing in her role and she sounded at times as if she were reading que cards. Definately not a show to spend your money on."
5,Awesome Movie!,"This movie is really sweet, and it depicts the hard time interracial couples have. I loved the story so much, and give it two thumbs up!"
3,Quite Good Enough To See,"As the girl danced for the Julliard faculty, her mother was spilled from an SUV. The audition's absent mom distracted, while the poor girl's arms and legs contracted. As if the Julliard rejection weren't a blow, the girl's deceased mother bequeathed her to a schmoe. The girl's father, though a trumpet play he, couldn't tell his arse from a wagon-load of bree. Off to school went the girl, where, in the downtown scene, she was a pearl. An African-American man she came to love, their former lives they had to shove. He taught her hip-hop, which she blended with ballet, next time at Julliard, she was there to.... The End."
5,One of my favorite movies,I have seen this movie many times and I consider it one of my favorites. It encourages you to believe in yourself and follow your dreams. The soundtrack for the movie is also eccellent.
1,horrible Hollywood drivel,"Unintelligent, typical liberal Hollywood propaganda...Hip-hop as a positive cultural phenomena...ridiculous story that tries to mask the real violence and true lack of artistic merit that are very much a part of hip-hop and rap....political correctness running wild..."
1,THE WORST,"This is the worst film I have viewed in some time. It's the type that you sit and watch and say ""I can't believe I spent 110 minutes watching this crap!!!!!!!!!!"""
3,BORING,SAVE THE LAST DANCE WAS BORING I JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL HOPEFULLY THE NEXT ONE THAT COMES OUT IS ALOT BETTER ):
5,Awesome movie!,"I loved this. I felt it was a very emotional movie. You could actually ""feel"" the passion the actors portrayed for their love of dance. The music, the choreography and the talent brought it all together. This is one movie I can watch over and over."
5,Very Surprised,"I can relate to this film in a lot of ways. They take a white girl and move her into an African-American neighborhood, which when I moved with my family that's what happened to me. In this film, Sara, portrayed by Julia Stiles, loves to dance. But she recounts the moments leading up to her mother's death, and blames herself for it. Saying basically that if weren't for her, Sara, that her mother wouldn't have been hurrying and wouldn't have gotten killed. She finds a friend in Derek who not only assures her that it is in fact not her fault that her mom was killed, but hangs out and becomes close to Sara. This film has a lot of dancing and a lot of hip-hop. Overall it was very enjoyable. I would recommend it."
1,Movies,They sent me a DVD that doesn't work in my DVD player. When I emailed them about it they sent me one website that was supposed to decode my DVD player so it would play it. There instructions didn't work. I even researched my own instructions and they did not work. I contacted the company again and there only response was as long as I paid for shipping back they would refund only the price of the movie and I needed to pay for all the shipping. The shipping is over $7 and the movie was only around $4.
3,"Cute, But Not The Best It Could Be","""Save The Last Dance"" was a cute movie about achieving dreams and judging people for their personalities rather than their appearence. It had a happy ending and kept your attention the whole way through. This was a good movie, but after seeing the movie ""Center Stage"", it's hard to say that this was an excellent movie. ""Center Stage"" was more realistic and, I thought, gave a better theme for the movie. You might like ""Save The Last Dance"", but I would recommend that you also see ""Center Satge"", a true five - star movie."
1,unimaginative,"Dull and unimaginative - a truely poor script that will surprise no one as you have worked out the whole story after the first five minutes. So poor, who puts up the money to make these things?"
3,Nice remake of an old idea.,"Reminded me of ""Dirty Dancing,"" but with a hip-hop twist. Great music and excellent choreography."
4,THE TRUTH BEHIND SAVE THE LAST DANCE,While many people think this movie is based around DANCE it is not.Save the last dance is mainly based around prejudice as it shows the way people react and sometimes feel towards other races for instance when Derek is taking Sara to the Ballet and while on the train this white woman is giving them the most awful look as though she is horrified by the fact of a white person and a black person being together. Another example is when Dereks sister and ex-Girlfriend tell Sara she has no right taking all there black men and that there are two worlds out there the black and the white and that she should stick to her own race. This my veiw of this movie and i still recomend people see it as it is quite a dramatic movie which draws you in.
1,Save the last dance,The DVD would not play on 3 different DVD players. I was not happy at all! I really don't think I would trust using this site again.
4,definately an improvement from the first one,"I don't know if it was the addition of castro or what, but the second edition of this trilogy is most definately better than the first. The first read like a comic book (don't get me wrong, i enjoy comics, it's just that they need pictures). THis one was more like a novel...I hope to see an improvement with the third in the series...maybe all the characters (and not just Bishop and Spider-Man) will become three-dimensional. Definately on the right track."
1,junk,"i know this is obsolete, but mine has barely been used. gone... zap... i guess i haven't recorded 5 dvd's and zero tapes!"
2,Unhappy purchaser,I purchased this item. Have had noting but issues with it freezing up when I try to record.
3,"Ok,shoe, good deal","Shoes are cute and a good deal. Not the most comfortable, but fits my needs for walking around or shopping."
2,NO REAL SUBSTANCE,"I have the feeling that Mr. Luciano was running out of ideas with this book. The only reason to read this book is for the inside accounts from the average players that the author enlists to fill out this book. This book is okay, if you are looking for a quick, light read."
3,3 RD TIME NOT THE CHARM,"THIS IS THE THIRD BOOK BY MR. LUCIANO. IT ALSO IS HIS WORSE. HIS ATTEMPT AT HUMOR IS VERY WANTING. I ENJOYED THE STORIES BY THE VARIOUS PLAYERS. THAT IS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK. IT CERTAINLY HAS THE RIGHT TITLE, FALL OF THE ETC ETC DOES DESCRIBE THIS VERY BORING AND DULL BOOK. HIS FIRST 2 BOOKS ARE A LOT BETTER THAN THIS TIME FILLER."
5,"This the best book I have ever read,it shows the inside game",The Fall of the Roman Empire is a great baseball book and I recommend it to any baseball fan
3,Varies from delightful to dismal,"Some of the stories and memories in this long book are literate, charming, and atmospheric, capturing the candy apple and night glow essence of Halloween in many and varied ways. There's nostalgia, real horror, and comedy. Unfortunately, some of the bad entries (F. Paul Wilson's ""Buckets"" would be more at home in Clinic Bomber's Monthly than this publication) bring the rating down. Such stories are horrifying only in the political sense.Buy the book if you're not spooked by the high price tag, but be prepared to skip around. I read it cover to cover, and would probably have liked it better if I'd been more discriminating, since the editors weren't."
5,Lots of fun to read,"It's a wonderful book about a fascinating writer. I always loved the way Royko could tell a story, so it was a pleasure to read the story of his life. Way to go Doug Moe! If you like biography and good writing, this one is for you.White Coat Wisdom: Extraordinary doctors talk about what they do, how they got there and why medicine is so much more than a job"
3,dubiously read,"I'm a sucker for identity-crisis books.This book captured my attention because it had a man waking up without memory of several months of his life and every indication that he his someone else. But this book was disappointing. There were so many identity changes that it just got tedious. By the end, I really didn't care about the big revelation as to the whole identity problem. I just wanted to finish the book and move on.Also I am almost never swift enough to guess the end before the author wants me to know, but in this book the ""surprise"" ending was painfully obvious very early on.I did, however, think that the future presented in the book was interesting for those who like speculative futures. I wouldn't write the book off entirely just on the basis of the description of the future. There is also a lot of action, which may entice some into reading it."
4,I liked Multiplex Man,"I've not reviewed a book before, but the other reviewer's criticism of the book is off-base in my opinion. His complaints are that the society is not believable because they have not yet banned cigarettes? The reality is that today's government totally depends on cigarettes for tax revenue. The tobacco companies make 10 cents or less on the sale of a pack, while the government rakes in $.50 to over $1 per pack. That is why we will not see cigarettes banned. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed Multiplex Man. Most of the SF books I buy turn out to be a disappointment, and many I never finish. But this one I stayed glued to until the end. It is true that I will probably not read it again, but then I have probably only read one or two books over again in my entire life."
4,Terrifyingly plausible future,"A rattling good yarn. Hogan's picture of decaying totalitarian west, surrounded by an Iron curtain to keep people from escaping from ""democracy"", is more believable than ever today.The main character is a bit irritating, since he spends most of the story brainwashed to completely believe the politically correct account of his society, even though everyday routine events continually demonstrate the falseness of that account.The Multiplex Man"
2,"Well written, but you've read it before","James Hogan has been a favorite of mine for a long time. It is a real joy to read hard SF written with skill, there are not many who can combine cutting edge science with the ability to write sensible sounding dialouge and fashion believable personalities. Having said that, this one does not make it. The old 'waking up with amnesia and killers after you' plot has been around for a long, long time. Sure, there are a couple of twists, but nothing really new. The real disappointment, however, is the political layering. Anyone who likes an L. Neil Smith novel would like ""The Multiplex Man"". Exactly the same depiction of Libertarians as good, smart, helpfull, successfull people; and everyone of any other viewpoint as eithier naive, criminal, mentally ill, or a combo of all three."
5,There is something about this one....,"It is scorching hot and really a fun read. I loved Toby who, after witnessing spanking as a voyeur, decides to take her life in her own hands and reach out for what she wants be placing an ad. Where she ends up is the perfect place for her - and many hot spankings ensue that she hates and loves with equal passion. The author is wonderful at getting into the characters heads so you can experience the spanking and discipline yourself. As easy as that sounds to do many (many!) authors cannot do it and the scenes, while hot to read, don't get you all riled up. These one's do. A variety of implements are used and there is some great sex in here as well. I love spanking and CP books of a more harsh nature and Hall's surely do deliver!"
3,A bit on the heavy side,"If you are after some serious spanking scenes, this book is full of them. Although the book is well written, I found the relentlessness of the punishments rather harsh and uncomfortable to fully enjoy the story."
4,Space related books,"Part of my collection on space. Nice, informative book for people interested in space travel."
3,"Good Graphics, Okay Game","I think exploring the Titanic on the computer is a lot of fun. The graphics are excellent, and you do sort of feel like you are really there. Some of the rooms are very exquisitely decorated, and it's neat to walk out on the deck.I think the game is okay, as adventure games go. Pro: The story is pretty good. It progresses at a pretty good pace. Cons: The navigation is a bit difficult in some rooms. Also, this is one of those games where you spend a lot of time interacting with characters, and choosing from a list of responses. Like many adventure games with video, some of the acting is not stellar.I think this game is worth buying if you like to explore, and are intrigued by the Titanic story."
4,Excellent software,"I have Titanic Adventure Out Of Time, and it's so much fun!! It's so realistic too. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it always freezes on me if I go too fast. I have to make my character go around the ship really slowly, and save my game every 3 minutes, which is really annoying. Other than that, it's a fantastic game! =)"
2,Way too expensive!!!,"I am rating the price, not the product. I love these graham crackers for my children - but I can get them at Wal-Mart for almost half the price! Ridiculous!"
3,Surprisingly easy...,"I'm not a crafty person and I usually dread these kind of toys. This is surprisingly simple! You just line up the tray, and press the button twice! The only thing that's a pain is placing the sequin in the tray face down, but I got the hang of it after a while. We've done a pair of pants so far. I think I got my money's worth, and some ($5.99)."
2,Size,"For some reason the sizing on these seemed too small. I have ordered, and I'm still wearing, the same underwear and same size. They fit fine. These seemed to tight."
3,Mixed bag,"While I like the fit & comfort of these underpants, after the first washing there was a rip in the seam. Not sure what this means for the longevity of this order."
1,Poor Quality,They were made of flimsy material that you could see through. They shrank about two sizes when washed in warm water.
2,the packaging was different and apparently so was the content,"the packaging had different graphics and the content, 6 pairs of hanes Cotton Briefs, also was different. briefs were smaller than previus prurchases of the same size of Hanes Cotton Briefs."
2,Cheaper than they used to be.,"I am disappointed in the quality of these panties. I've worn Hanes for years and tried to replace what I have with these new ones.. The fabric is thinner that the old ones, the size runs small, and they seem to be cut a bit short. I will keep them because it is not worth it to spend the money to return them, but I will by the Fruit of the Loom next time."
1,Hanes Briefs,Bit the bullet and ordered size 7 (have been a size 6 forever). They fit great and come in those lovely packs - so suitable for travel! Hanes really are the only briefs anyone should buy.
5,patrice,"I really like this movie about this kid is really,really between good and evil.most likely about Mikey has been a baddest,meanest,and evil little monster.The only way he gets away with killing people when someone gets in his way.this kid is up to something and no other kid like him can murder.This movie has more violent killing than the good son."
5,Try disoplining this brat and end up in electrified water,"Just watched this film today, it is one of the most spookiest films. The acting is very good, especialy from the young boy, this film is actualy banned in the uk. Aparently the reason being in my opinion is that it's submision conincided with a case here where two Ten year old boys murdered and turtured a two year old boy in Merseyside. Watch out for Mikey2"
2,It's pure madness with no concept.,"i should say that this movie is just DULL. The characters who tried to stop Mikey from his killing frenzy are absolutely dumb. The kid just wins all the way to the end of the movie, which makes it dull."
5,A Decent Thriller...,"Suspenseful and frightening. Mikey provides what a movie of this genre is expected to. An absolute 'must see' for Brian Bonsall fans. The scary nature of this particular character he portrays, does not diminish Brian Bonsall's overwhelming cuteness in the slightest. He is truly one of the most adorable 'young boy' actors of all time. I also recommend the following Brian Bonsall movies and hope that they are all available on DVD soon: 'Desperate Motive', 'Blank Check', 'Father And Scout', 'Fatherhood' and 'Lily In Winter'."
3,"it was okay,just not very scary","this movie is very good,it is worth renting,i swear.good for people who are just starting on watching scary movies.most of it was just about mikey in his new home but the beginning and end are scary.good acting too.just kinda boring"
2,We've adopted Damien!,"After brutally murdering his family, little tyke is transported to a new home and settles his murdering appetite when he thinks he actually likes his new family. But before long, his heart is broken and he kills his new family. He is then back in adoption and the process repeats itself YET AGAIN! Sick and gory thriller wins big points for style and execution but you either like it or you don't. And if you like this, you'll like anything."
4,"Evil movie, But very good",If you like a movie with a bit of EVIL played by (Brian Bonsall as Mikey) who is a very bad boy. Then this is the movie for you. The story is pretty good as well for most of the movie. With a good cast. (For 15+ & over)
3,Mikey,"I remember reading the tagline for the movie when I was younger and always wanted to see it. This film came out when horror was dead but the movie is pretty good. The trailer shows every kill in this movie, a first for a horror movie.It starts off with little Mikey getting slapped by his mother and he kills his sister (because she didnt stick up for him), his mother, and then his father. Mikey videotaped the killings, which I thought would have come into play later in the film but it doesnt. After the murders, he's adopted by a new family. The film then shows little hints of Mikey being a psycho until the very last part of the film. While the acting was good, I thought the ending just sucked and it probably would have had a sequel if this film did anything at the box office. This is a lost gem in an era where horror films were all but forgotten. I paid 30 for a authentic copy and I see a seller selling one forn only ten bucks, I recommend picking it up. Not a bad movie at all."
3,A Chore to Read,"Maybe I'm just lazy...but a 250 page book with no pictures and just list after list of instructions with little format and order? I couldn't get through it, much as I wanted to. I have yet to find ""the"" clicker book as far as teaching behaviors goes (Click for Joy! is an exceptional primer)."
5,one of the greatest book written about serial killers,one of the best books ever written about serial killers. I read all of james patterson's books. This was one of my favorites of his and that I ever read of any author
4,Great thriller!,"I love Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. Both did a great job is this thriller. If you haven't seen it, take the time for this one."
4,GREAT MOVIE BUT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE BOOK,"MORGAN FREEMAN IS A GOOD ACTOR, BUT HE IS NOT JAMES PATTERSON'S ALEX CROSS. PLOT LINE TOOK CONSIDERABLE LICENSE WITH PATTERSON'S BOOK. IF I HAD NOT READ THE BOOK FIRST, I WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE THE MOVIE."
2,"Yawn, I've Seen ""Seven"", and this doesn't Measure Up","Morgan Freeman: ""Seven"", Yes ""Kiss The Girls"", absolutely not!!!. Carey Elwes, his best performances were, ""Princess Bride, and Robin Hood:MIT"" Ashley Judd was much better in A Time To Kill(she had blone hair, hottie). She does not fit the G.I. Jane mold, and throughot the movie, she trie to be tough, but still is very fearful. This was a low-budget version of one of the great suspenseful, get inside your head thrillers. Hint it has Pitt, Spacey, Freeman, and Paltrow!. If you want a video movie, rent it on tuesday(use this as the free rental, it's not worth your $2.00!!!!"
2,absorbing but slight repellent movie,"Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure to watch, so are Judd and Ewles (though Ewles is developing a Alec Guinness quality of changing a lot from role to role) are their usual professional self. However, the movie is more than heavy with a misogynist view that taints the film. Freeman is super in the role that he is totally wrong for, the friend absorbing, but just slowly turns you off. Rent it if you are a fan of these fine actors, read the books, but I doubt you will wish to invest in a DVD copy for your library. Just a poor Silence of the Lambs or Manhunter (the original with William Peterson!!) both done much better."
3,Kiss the Girls,"The movie is a great thirller outside of the language content I would have rated it higher, I do not care for the language"
2,I dislike this kind of movie,"What I dislike is the playing of audience's worst side.The antihero status given to serial killers is a bad thing ( in moraland social terms).The publicity and books about them may sell;true crime magazines go back in the 1800's, butmaking the methods and motivations so public may encourageothers to do the same.In this movie the female lead is done very well,as is the staging and dialog. The movie is very welldone; it just have very few socially redeeming qualitiesbesides being a 'seller' at the box office."
5,Wonderful team!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Morgan Freeman plays a very good part, and Ashely Judd, the same. when you see them two in a movie, you already now it's going to be a great movie. Ashely Judd, and Morgan Freeman are a great team. I'm a huge Morgan Freeman fan. The man could read the phone book, and I would love to it!!!!"
3,This movie's okay,"Psychotic killer who collects smart, pretty girls is relentlessly pursued by a former victim and a cop. Surprisingly good with great performances by a great talented cast but the killer is VERY disappointing to say the least. Pizza and pepsi."
4,a very suspenseful mystery film .,the story starts off slowly but builds as it goes along and leads you to the suspenseful conclusion. The cast consists mainly ofMorgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. Both do an excellent job and make the story believable.
3,not bad,morgan freeman is one of my favorite actors. I have quite a few of his movies.Some of the other movies he is in are better
3,Good though not amazing,"I enjoyed thsi film for what it was. I'm sure that the books are much moere detailed into the characters but that for the sake of economizing time and plot, the movie moves along swiftly. The twist of a killer's victim getting away but still being necessary to being bait was a good twist as a plot point. I enjoyed Judd and Freeman working together---I don't think it could quite be called a sexual chemistry as much as an easiness with one another and a seeming respect for each other's abilities. That personal quality translates nicely to the screne so that I got the feeling that this police officer might trust Judd to help get his niece back. A good movie, though necessarily amazing, like Seven or Silence of the Lambs, but worth a viewing."
2,A stale derivative and wearily predictable.,"Nothing very original here, I'm afraid; it's a potpourri of themes taken from a dozen or more psycho-thriller dramas that's preceded this -- The Collector, Dirty Harry, Silence of the Lambs et al. I recommend 'The Collector' made in 1965 directed by William Wyler as an absolute standout classic film in this genre. See this film, it will truly chill and shock you without the cliched Hollywood gimmicks that are so de rigueur today. I agree with other critics' comments about this film being 'hackneyed' and deja vu."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Kiss the Girls just about defines the concept of a forgettable movie; aside from the talent of the two leads there is nothing whatsover remarkable about this run-of-the-mill thriller and there is thus no reason to watch or purchase it.
4,A Great Way To See James Patterson On Screen!,"Well, I have read the Alex Cross series and I was excited to find out that they had made Kiss the Girls into a movie. While the movie takes some of it's own turns in portraying the James Patterson novel, like Alex Cross (played by Morgan Freeman)is somewhat older and isn't quite into the ladies as much as the book, it does give credit to the great storyline. I would recommend to any James Patterson fan!"
5,An Awsome movie!!!,"Any one who likes thriller movies has to see this film! Its go great, I've seen it twice and Im ready to buy the film. A great movie all around with an awsome, unbelievable ending."
3,Wow! A GOOD 90s horror movie!,This is the best 90s horror movie I've seen. It's suspenseful and psychological. Not a mindless slasher. The end could use some work but it's definitely worth seeing. I'd include it in my top 5 favorite movies.
3,Just ok,"Suspensful with great acting and interesting storyline but the movie actually left me feeling a little sick inside. If it wasn't for the great acting, this movie would only get 2 stars. In this movie, Morgan Freeman investigates the disappearance of a family member of his, a bright young girl with musical talent, at the same time a rash of rapes, disappearances of other talented women. I don't want to tell you too much more incase you want to watch it, but I don't think I can reccommend this movie. I guess this really isn't the subject matter I enjoy."
2,predictable,"I watched this movie anticipating the Alex Cross film coming. I can only pray the new one is better. Kiss the Girls was incredibly predictable. My son and I put the next line into the actors mouths often enough that we did end up entertaining ourselves, but not the entertainment I was looking for."
5,Great Movie,"Kiss the Girls is one of my all time favorite movies and I was thrilled to finally acquire the DVD.The direction and plot of the film place it in a category with others such as Seven and Silence of the Lambs. If you're not into thrillers, this is definantly not a flick for you.But if you are, then this one comes highly, highly recommended.The story is set in the famous researh triangle of the Carolina's where beautiful, brilliant, and talented college women are being abducted from their homes. James Patterson's (see Along Came a Spider) famous detective Alex Cross takes on the case after his niece becomes one of the missing.A fabulous thiller, just chilling enough to make you need a blanket while you watch."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"I was blown away! This movie kept me gessing and pondering, who is Cassanova??? Find out for yorself!!"
2,How cliched can you get?,"I was not expecting a masterpiece in the art of film making but I have to admit I was taken aback by the sheer awfulness of what I saw. Kiss the Girls tried and failed to live up to the atmospheric thrillers of its type it was trying to immitate. It was indeed a very dark film, but at no time did I remotely feel tense or particulary interested in its outcome. Even the otherwise excellent Morgan Freeman failed to gave this film that extra edge it was so badly needing. Having said that there was little any cast could have done with a script straight from the textbook of Hollywood film writing combined with one of the most cliched endings I have ever seen, which went even further to undermine the rest of the film. Flawed on so many fronts it is hard to find a single redeeming feature and is definiteley one to avoid."
5,YOU JUMP WITH THIS ONE!!!!!,The acting in this film by Freeman and Judd was excellent. You are left guessing right up until the last minutes of the picture. Excellent thinking movie where you have to stay alert and makes you wonder does anyone really want to live alone in a big house anymore???????
5,Very good thriller!,Awesome flick. I've seen it many times and will watch it again. Acting and story are very good. Highly Recommend this movie.
5,Kiss the Girls,Excellent murder mystery that is fraught with subplots that send the mind into a tail spin until the last moments reveal the sick twisted mind of a murderer.
3,Photo misleading,"The quality glass, finish, and ease of assembly are all great on this piece. However, the photo shows the arms coming to an end just before the edge of the glass shade, when in reality the arms extend almost 2"" beyond the edge of the glass. This gives it a spikey look with metal sticking out, which is certainly not what I had I mind for my pretty kitchen dining. We're keeping it for now, since we had been without lighting and had looked for a solution for a long time... but we will be replacing it when we find something less abrasive."
4,A classic album,"Another great Journey album with the wonderful voice of Steve Perry when his voice was a pleasant sounding tenor. Some of my favorite songs were I'm Crying, People and Places, Stay Awhile. Make sure you get the expanded reissued digipak version with extra songs like Good Morning Girl, Stay Awhile, Homemade Love. I had to buy this album twice to get the correct version for my collection. I didn't give it 5 stars because I liked Frontiers and Infinity so much more. This is a great album nonetheless and an essential for any Journey collector."
3,Not Bad,"Ok effort, But not near as solid as Evolution and Escape. Highlights are: Any way you want it, Walks like a lady, Someday Soon - Great vocals by original keyboardist Gregg Rollie, People and Places - Great opening vocals by Guitarist Neal Schon and Line of Fire. Rest of the album seems like filler. If you're new to some of Journey's older recordings with Steve Perry, I recommend starting with the disc Evolution."
5,DEPARTURE,"THIS IS ONE AMAZING ALBUM. THE MUSIC IS POWERFUL,AND (THE VOICE) STEVE PERRY IS SIMPLY AWESOME. HE IS MY FAVORITE SINGER AND THIS ALBUM DELIVERS HIS GROUND SHAKING VOICE AS I LOVE TO HEAR IT."
4,"great product, slow shipping","My 5-year old son thought it would be cool to microwave the DVD we rented from the library. It came out all warped and cracked, but at the same time smooth. I imagine it was quite a show! But the librarians probably wouldn't agree.DVD was perfect and new, but even though we paid for expedited shipping it took around 4 days to arrive."
1,Very Bad Movie,"This movie is totally unlike all of the other Pinocchio movies I have ever seen. It didn't follow the Pinocchio theme and wasn't really about honesty. If you like the story of Pinocchio, the original version is the best."
1,Sicko Pinocchio,I watched most of this movie with a Kindergarten class as a substitute teacher. I found it totally inappropriate for children and was shocked to see that it was rated G. It has many very dark scenes and a considerable amount of violence as well as several sexually suggestive scenes. I'm sure many of the kids had nightmares after watching it. Any parent should consider this a PG-13 film and then be cautious about kids seeing it. For the little ones the Disney version is the way to go.
1,Stick with the Disney version,"When I watched the version with Paul Ruebens as the title character, I liked it so I decided to watch this with my little brother, I did not like this movie at all, I feel bad for feeling that way cause Jonathan Taylor-Thomas was great in The Lion King, Man of the House and Home Improvement but this movie is not enjoyable or watchable at all."
4,"Good movie, but not the same as the animated classic","I asked for this movie in 1996 because I was a HUGE Jonathan Taylor Thomas fan.When I first watched it, I was expecting it to be a lot like the animated Disney version. To a certain extent it is, but there are a lot of scenes in this movie that aren't in the animated version.What I Didn't Like About the Movie: With live action and JTT's likeness as a puppet, I got a ""Toystory"" / ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit Feel"". It just didn't look right. This is minor considering the overall quality of the story.I did enjoy this movie. It doesn't have content that you have to worry about little ones seeing. Though it isn't destined to be a Disney classic, this is a good movie for the whole family."
1,QUICKDELIVERY BUT ITS A PIECE OF JUNK,"It makes a huge mess, its very cheap feeling and doesn't do a good job of doing what its supposed to do. I threw it in the trash."
2,looks nice but waste a lot of coffee,"I bought this because I hated digging in those bags of coffee especially when it got down to the bottom.While this looks very nice I have it next to my coffee pot on the counter, it leaks coffee out the bottom from the time you pick it up (just a tiny bit then) to the time you put it back (note: putting back in tray very gently) it leaks at least a half to three quarters teaspoon out. The tray is helpful at catching some but it is very small and a custom fit to the dispenser, it does not help. I still end up with coffee on the counter. I thought this was going to be a wonderful (especially since it is non-electric)appliance. It turns out I waste way to much coffee. I have just written an email to the company to see if there is a fix for this extra leakage. So I'm not sure if this is common to all. Just know mine is worthless. I did not try sugar in here, but I imagine it would leak worse since the coffee is bigger granuale."
3,Too pushy,"This book would have been excellent had the author not promoted herself and all her books throughout. Her response to a Maine student, below, proves what an egoist she is. The book was described as being about a family in which the wife murdered her husband, not about the author's shortcomings as a wife and mother. However, the author continually veered from the story to write about her own miserable life, while at the same time plugging her books. If I wanted to know about Joyce Maynard's life I would have gotten her biography.It is too bad Maynard's incredibly large ego ruined an otherwise enjoyable book. My advice to readers is to skip over the parts about Maynard's life, as they have NO bearing on the events she was supposed to have written about."
4,"If You Like True Crime, You'll Love This!","The story of Nancy and Bob Seaman and how their longtime miserable marriage explodes into murder and tears apart their families and their community.Having read alot of true crime, I really enjoyed this book. As some other reviewers mentioned, once you start it, it's hard to put down.My only problem with it,(and why I didn't give it five stars) was there was a bit too much about Joyce Maynard and HER bad marriage in it. I would have perferred she stick to the Seaman's story rather than so much of her own.But if you like Ann Rule, you'll like this book."
4,Riveting,"Maynard is such a skillful writer, and Internal Combustion is a gripping book. I began reading it in the morning and didn't stop until I finished it that evening. Maynard has a real feel for the people she writes about, as well as for Detroit and for the American car culture."
2,Midland 18-259W,this antenna didn't improve the reception at all.. it actually turned the unit to static when it was plugged into the Midland WR-300
1,Doesn't work,I have the Midland 300 and thought this would make reception clearer. Wrong! It made it much worse. Don't waste your money.
1,DO NOT EVER BUY!!!!,"I purchased the Midland weather radio from Amazon and it is great, but because I just put a new metal roof on my house I decided to order the window antenna. I ordered through Amazon but it came directly from Atlanta Network Technologies, Inc. It arrived WITHOUT an integral screw. I emailed the company and was told to call. I called, got a voice that told me another email - which I did. I received an email that told me I must pay a restocking fee. I called again and was told to return to Amazon. I contacted Amazon and was told to contact the company. I still don't have ""the"" screw - but obviously did receive a ""screw of sorts"". The company is the worst in assistance and will not cooperate. DO NOT EVER PURCHASE FROM ATLANTA NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES. The screw is so small that even Radio Shack doesn't carry it. So now I am forced to order another antenna - but NOT from ANT."
3,Great when necessary,I was a little disappointed that it had to be mounted permanantly in one spot. I was hoping it could travel with us.
3,Teacher Talks-- I finished the series,"If you haven't read any of the Watchers books by Peter Lerangis, then you are missing out. They are cool and interesting science fiction, that keep you guessing well into the book. This one in particular is gripping until the end. It makes connections between science concepts and the supernatural science lab ideas. I do question the parents in this book. I have two students in my class who are reading these books along with me and I can't finish them fast enough to hand them off to them. They often connect to science and social studies in the book to help students build their connections to real life. This series is great. I am beginning to explore some other writing by Peter Lerangis in some other series as well. You should too!"
1,Dont waste your money,"I tried to buy this book and they sent me the WRONG BOOK! Plus I never heard back from them when I emailed. Dont waste your time or money, these people must not know what they are doing!"
4,cute and heartwarming,My kids loved this video. They really liked the songs and characters especially Wilbur and Cardigan. I would recommend this movie to anyone that has kids.
1,Run away!,My five year old daughter begged for this after seeing the original several times. After about fifteen minutes she turned it off and made me hide it in the basement so she would never have to see it again.
3,WE LOVE CHARLOTTE,"MY CHILDREN LOVE ALL THE CHARLOTTE'S WEB MOVIES, GLAD TO ADD THIS ONE TO OUR COLLECTION EVEN THOUGH THE DVD ITSELF CAME TO US SCRATCHED AND WITH A CHIP OUT OF THE CENTER, BUT IT STILL WORKS. WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW BEFORE I PURCHASED HOWEVER...:( COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS ONE 4 ****'S"
1,Appalling,"It is a good clean movie for younger kids, but just because there's nothing bad in it doesn't mean it's a good choice. There should be something good in a kids' movie, too, and Charlotte's Web 2 is completely void of any redeeming qualities. It is a sequel that did not need to be made and exists only for the sake of a quick buck. That is a repugnant reason for making a movie."
4,A Heartfelt Sequel,"This is a very good follow-up to the original. It has the charm of the original that should be enjoyed by the younger viewers. However, the drawings are a total departure from the simplicity of the original. That rough and innocent look in some ways demonstrates the delicate power of the original's script that made it so appealing and heartwarming. But there's enough warmth of the heart to go around in this one that most viewers shouldn't be disappointed. I suppose that if you grew up with the original you may still yearn for that beloved simply told tale. But remember that was your day. Now it's theirs."
1,It Stinks!!,"They take each character from the first movie and change them all together. Fern is not the sweet little girl that you knew. Wilbur is more like a wild animal than a sweet hearted, kind, loving pig. Charlotte's children, I think, could have a much, much better attitude. The illustrations were a big flop. The movie itself was a big flop. The new characters are very badly done. In each scene there is a new main character. Wilbur himself, the amazing star from the last movie is only the main character about twice. Charlotte's children and a new character really show up more times in the movie than Wilbur. (Well, they changed Wilbur into so bad of a character that I'm glad.) Trust me, do not bother watching it."
1,Did not get too see movie,"Terrible. We did not get to see the movie in full. Service was cut off. Said try again later. When we did it had been removed from our library. Would not recommend this service too anyone.Respectfully,Michael J Grassi"
2,Beware!!,"Take the above reviews with a grain of salt. They are reproduced almost verbatim on other bookseller's sites. I believe that they have been written by friends of the authors, and do not reflect the actual content of the book."
1,Poor Writing,"This was a very disappointing book. I only got through the first 3 chapters before I gave up on it. There were numerous typographical and grammatical errors that made it almost impossible to read. I finally started reading ""Windows 2000 DNS"" by Roger Abell, etc. by New Riders publishers and found it to be exactly what I wanted."
2,Ruined by a dominant strategy,"This game seemed rather fun at first, but got old fast once it became apparent that the person with the most jesters always wins.Rio Grande Games publishes another game called Augsburg 1520, which has similar mechanics and enjoyment, without the disappointing flaw of a dominant strategy. I wholeheartedly recommend trying that one instead."
2,I think I hate this game...,"Strictly speaking, there is nothing wrong with PoF. The rules are easy enough to understand and the strategy is reasonably complex and it's not completely ugly...ish. It's just so bland visually -- especially the game cards. Buy it if you are into Eurogames and don't mind semi-dry 2 hour experiences. SKip it otherwise"
3,The comic came before the movie,"Just so it's clear with everyone. The Jim Carrey film 'The Mask' was based on the late 80's early 90's character. Originally appearing in Mayhem 1-4, the original stories were often mean spirited with the blackest of humor and quite violent and gory.This trade is the 4th story by the Arcudi/ Manke team and in many ways owes much to the film rather than the comics that is continues. Why? Well the mask in this version is far more cartoony and less brutal as the film portrayed him to be.I warn fans who came in because of the prior comic to expect a more toned down tale. On the other hand this and Joker/Mask would easily be the comics I'd hand the casual film 'Mask' fan who was interested in the origins of the character."
3,Sssssmokinnnnn....!,"Typically hillarious with the Jim Carrey starred movie, this one has all the bloody action that adds more twisted appeal to the Mask lore. Doug Mahnke art is crispy though I prefer his work on The Mask Returns. Storyline-wise so-so."
3,4GB Sony,"This memory card gets the job done, but after a while its plastic casing came undone and had to be taped to keep from falling apart. San-Disk is a little more sturdy."
1,"Stick likely good, source comp;any bad",I ordered the Smart Stick a month ago and still haven't received it. Neither the source company nor Amazon have provided replacement. Postal Service tracking stopped at step one of the trip. So I have camera with no memory stick. Bummer.
1,The item is not working in any of the system!,"This is Sony product so I believe and trust to get this item, but it doesn't work even one time.Really frustrated and send my feedback to the seller, till i didn't get any reply from them."
1,Sony memory stick problems,"I'm sorry to say that the first Sony 4G memory stick with adapter did not work at all. After I contacted the company I bought it from, they graciously agreed to replace it. They sent a new memory stick but did not replace the adapter. The new memory stick does not work either. It could be that the adapter is not working, but I get a ""memory stick error"" message on my camera. If I had bought this from a local business I could take it in and show them how it doesn't work, but doing this long distance is a pain. I'd like to try to replace the adapter, but can't find one for sale anywhere. So...I have no idea if the memory sticks actually works since the adapter is needed for use in my camera. Bummer."
5,Sony 4 GB memory stick,I am very plased with this product. It's very reliable.Only dislike like I had to purchase a different card reader for it.Sony 4 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo Flash Memory Card MSMT4G
5,Flawless,"It's amazing, plenty of storage space, and you wont need UMD movies anymore cuz this holds like 8 movies, get it."
5,"Good, but not enough space for me","Very good quality product, I just need more and cheaper...Can Anyone say Ebay and China!?!"
5,Sony 4 GB Memory Stick PRO DUO ( MSX-M4GS ),"So far im having fun i like it it's great and what else can i say 4gb im so HAPPY lol i recommend this to anyone finally i can put as many movie as i want and musics, etc... in my PSP. JUST as shown in the picture. Adapter, manual, and of course the memory brand new!!"
3,not a full compatible reading,"It's nice to have 4GB in your camera, but when I try to read it on my PC I have some problems, it's seems not to be 100% compatible."
4,Sony Memory Stick is A++++,I purchased this memory stick recently and have been very happy with it. I am able to fit at least 6 movies at a time along with storing memory for my games. I rate this card A++++++++++
1,THIS PRODUCT BY SONY IS JUNK,"I WILL NEVER BUY ANY OTHER MEMORY FROM SONY EVER AGAIN I DO NOT CARE HOW CHEAP IS ITIS A PIECE OF JUNK I USED FOR A FAMILY PICTURES AND 2 MONTHS LATER THIS JUNK SAID CAN""T READ IT AND NOW ALL MY FAMILY PICTURESARE LOSS SINCE CAN""T TRANSFER TO A BETTER MEMORY CARD"
3,customer,"Although it is a little different from what it is described, it still has the same function as what I need for my camera. Fast shipping."
4,sony memory stick,Works like it should in the sony camera it was meant for. I docked one star because it has two pieces. Why sony did this I don't know. It's one other thing that gets lost or you forget to bring.
4,Good Mem Stick,"this is one of the best sony product that i used. i use it for psp, camera, and as usb drive. it's tiny shape always fill my memcard reader easily.the bad thing is that the card charger sometimes is not really good.that's it"
1,NOT as shown in the photo or description!,"I ordered this item because I need the adapter for my card reader and what I got is the newer version memory card only, so the photos and description on this page are wrong. You will NOT get the older version with the adapter."
1,Not Pleased with the Adaptor,"Memory Stick works fine. Initially the adaptor that came with the packet didnt work. I complained with Amazon who redirected me to the seller itself. Seller promptly sent me another adaptor which were two in number, neither of them worked again. I tried by using the adaptor with multiple computers, story remains the same. Even though i am fine with the service provided, the quality of the product is not at all good."
5,Sony 4 GB memory stick,"If you love to take picture and looking for a memory stick that holds aot of picture this is the perfect memory stick. The Sony 4 GB memory stick holds about 2800 picture, I have a Sony Cyber Shot W120 and the stick has more then enough room for all the pictures me and my girlfriend take. I like the memory stick so much i bought the same one for my PSP."
5,Sony 4gig MMS Stick and Adapter,The MMS Stick and adapter work great in older Sony cameras and devices designed to use full size MMS memory sticks. The adapter allows you to use the newer mini versions with much higher capacity.
3,Buyer beware,I bought a 4GB ProDuo here off amazon. it turned out to be a good fake... at least for a while. It was very difficult to tell that i had purchased a fake even to the point of compairing it to a store purchased RETAIL version. The Fake worked fine until i started to put large amounts of data on it in perticular video's for playback on my PSP. The card then corrupted every file that was put on.As for the store bought RETAIL version i am quite happy with it. it works fine even though it is a little slower than the 32MB one that i have. It also works well as a Pandora's Memory Stick.
5,Good and cheap,"I bought one of these at a pawn shop in Alaska for $15 and gamestop wanted $70 Give me a break GS. But the amount of stuff it holds is incredible from Game saves, Pics, Music, Downloads whatever you want to use it for you go right ahead i'm sure it'll take you a while to fill it up."
5,Excellent product,"I made the mistake of first buying a cheap knockoff and had nothing but problems. Lesson learned. This genuine article costs only slightly more, and works flawlessly."
5,ECSTATIC!!,"I liked this product because it has 4 GB memory and it is real Sony pro duo like the description and pictured. The vendor is truely honest, and authentic. I am very happy with the product!"
2,Memory Stick PRO Duo Mark 2 Matic Gate 4GB,I ordered a Memory Stick PRO Duo Mark 2 Magic Gate 4GB for my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S80 Camera and a Memory StickDUO Adapter. I have made numerous attempts to get the stick to work with no success. If you have any suggestions to get the stick to work you may call me at 706-561-7901 or e-mail me at fkscott13@att.net. Thank you. F. Kenneth Scott
1,It's fake,"I bought one from ""allways-satisfied"" it was very slow in the beginning then it stopped working forever!!actually I was surprised with the price it was only $37.88My advice is that you have to buy from Sony only."
1,the worst purchase i ever did,i bought one and it didnt work so i sent it to sony and got it back and they said it was a fake and that they wouldnt fix it of course then i called amazon and told them and they said to contact the seller which i did and now im waiting to get my money back worse purchase i have ever made
3,Exactly what I ordered,"Although this was what I ordered, the pakage was in another language... Luckily I had this exact camera and memory stick, but may be more difficult for someone who may not know how to use it."
1,Not what was described,"I ordered this item as described ""MemoryStick PRODuo+adapter"". It did NOT have the adapter, just the memory stick. So now, I have to order a new adapter as well, and it won't be here by Christmas, which is when I needed it. Very disappointed. :("
1,The memory isn't original,"The memory that they sent me is a copy, is not original, does not work with my devices (PSP, W810i, Computer). The worse purchase than I have made."
1,FAKE MEMORY STICK,THE MEMORY STICK I GOT WAS FAKE AND IT DOESN'T WORK WITH THE PSP.BE CAREFULL WHERE YOU GET THE PRODUCT AN THE MONEY YOU PAY FOR THEM.
1,It was not useful,"I bought this item for a sony camera i also bought, but it happened that it didn't work. The camera uses another kind of memory, so i waste my money."
1,an awful experience,"First of all, I ordered a 4GB SONY memory stick pro duo; however, the one I received from Mgs was 1GB. Secondly, I ordered a brand new SONY memory stick pro duo; however, I received a VERY used one. The adaptor even was broken. I don't know what's wrong. It's never happened before. I tried to contact the seller, and returned it on Apr 2nd. From internet of UPS, I know the memory stick was delivered. I then contact the seller again, and was told that they didn't receive the memory stick. I was disappointed. It's an awful experience. I don't hope any more to get the refund, but I should let the buyer know it, and I also hope the Amazon should do something to prevent the loss of buyer."
5,Memory Stick Pro Duo,I have used this memory stick for three weeks and it works great having ample storage for 4000 pic even at 10Meg each.
1,Not as pictured or described,I own a sony camera which they no longer make the memory stick for...i thought id end up buying a new camera when i found this and thought it would be the answer. I ordered this memory stick because it clearly stated and showed that it came with an adaptor that would allow it to work in my camera..it arrived without the adaptor. I now have to order the adaptor seperately and hope the memory stick works.
1,Not happy,This memory stick with the adapter would not work with the sony camera. Difficult to get out of the camera and worse yet could not be read by the epson printer. This product was returned.
1,Fake!,This was the card that I bought years back that was giving me alot of problem...I put videos on this card and people say their video was okay while I was having hard time watching video.I later discovery how to tell fake memory card for real one.....so heads up...don't buy memory card on amazon!!Go buy at bestbuy or walmart
1,Please,"God, the price of this is just so insane!! only get it if you're going to buy one helluva lotta games. Otherwise it's just smarter to get a 1 GB stick"
1,It was awful! I received a wrong item and the store didn't give me back the money!,"It was very disgusting to buy this memory stick in Amazon web site.I ordered a Sony Memory stick (accordint to the picture and the product reference number) but the store send me a wrong item, a kind of flash memory card!! That is, the item I received was totallly different from the item I have ordered. I did several claims without any answer. And I didn't receive my money back. Due to this, my advice to the other customers is: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS WEB SITE!!!!Sincerely,Marco"
4,Great Value,I purchased this for use with a PSP and it is a great alternative to the other memory sticks out there. Plenty of space with a little under 4 gigs for storage so not too bad at all. Excellent for booting iso's or video from though. The only thing that is slightly an annoyance with my card is it has a tendency to become stuck in the card port which can be a pain. Transfer speeds are about as good as you can expect. A must buy for any PSP enthusiast!
1,It's FAKE. DO NOT BUY IT FROM Digital Media Source,"IT'S FAKE. DO NOT BUY IT FROM Digital Media Source.It's dead after 4 months. I called Sony support and sent it to Laredo, TX. Sony Repair Center in Laredo Texas sent it back and confirmed ""FAKE""."
1,Sony 4GB Memory Stick,I have ordered Sony 4GB Memory Stick but got micro SD card instead which is of no use just waste of money.
3,Pro Duo doesn't work with my Sony camera. All my other Sony sticks do.,"Recently I got 2 new Memory Pro Duo 4GB sticks. When put into a card reader on my Mac, it has an .ind file that won't open. When put into my camera, it doesn't work. Do these work with all Sony cameras? All my other Memory sticks from Sony work fine in the camera and on my computer. Does anyone have a solution? Thanks."
3,Decent product,Had no issues with this product. Didn't need that extra piece but oh well. Delivered in normal time.
3,meh...,"tried this, and it worked a little i suppose. THEN i tried the ""furminator"" (search it on amazon)....go with the furminator. this thing I think i used once and got rid of it. the furminator is awesome. shedding blade pales in comparison"
5,i love it,"In my view Forrest Gump is one of the best movies of the 90's. Forrest Gump is the story of one man's life, through good times and bad. Set in the ""emerging"" 60's and 70's, Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) experiences meeting some of the most important people in the U.S.A of his time - J.F.K, Elvis etc. With little knowledge of who these people are Forrest just thinks of them as everyday people like himself.Me and Jenny we we're like pee's and carrots. My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what ya gonna get"
5,Tom Hanks' Talent Shines Forth,Tom Hanks keeps the viewer eating out of his hand as he doles out a fabulous performance no one should miss.
5,THE BEST FILM EVER,WHY ON EARTH COULDNT HOLLYWOOD MAKE FILMS LIKE THIS? THIS WAS AN EPIC. IT TAUGHT US EVERYTHING WE COULD LEARN IN 3 HOURS AND DID IT SO SHOCKINGLY. THOSE IDIDOTS WHO HATE THIS FILM ARE THE ONES WHO THINK WILD WILD WEST AND GODZILLA ARE GREAT FILMS BECAUSE THEY ONLY LIKE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND NOT A STORY WHICH MAKES A FILM A REAL FILM. TOO BAD IT DIDNT WIN EVERY OSCAR!
3,mikeg frpm moviemax,"Ok, ok. This is a good picture .And Tom Hanks is definately at the top of the bar. And any true Tom Hanks fan must add this to their collection. I just have to ask you, have you seen the picture SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Yes ?, Well which picture do you think was better. ? Right. So why did GUMP steal the Best Picture Academy Award that year? I know I need to let this go, but this is the only thing I have against this fine picture."
2,Ugh ....,... highly overrated sappy nonsense. Filled with one tired old cliche' after another all wrapped up in one sappy theme. Only reason I gave it more than 1 star was for the clever use of spliced vintage footage.
3,"Terrific Hanks, but Falls Flat","I realize I'm in the minority here, but I found ""Gump"" - both at the movies and on DVD - far inferior to all its hype. Sure, Tom Hanks gives a noble performance, and his one liners rank with other classics from the world of film, but this sweeping tale is way too ludicrous to be believed. Certain scenes are astounding acheivements - especially the editing of monumental historical moments that put Forrest front and center. Yet, where is the movie's heart? Personally, I found it in Sally Field's performance as Gump's mother, and in Gary Sinise's terrific Oscar-worthy moments as his platoon leader. Overall, the movie really asks an awful lot from its audience - you must suspend all semblence of time and space, reality and history in order to be taken away. Yet, in the end, it's a soft melodrama, on the order of other Hollywood blockbusters that deserved less praise (think ""Terms of Endearment.)"
3,"Good Movie, but Overrated.","This movie was good, but not as good as other movies that I've seen that serve as ""quasi-baby-boomer scrap book."" Plus, I still think the edgie ""Pulp Fiction"" deserved to take home the award for best picture that year."
2,"Forrest ""Dump"" is more appropriate","Good, but in a very average way; given the hype it should have been a lot better. Hanks is ok, even if the act does get a bit old after awhile. Sinise, however, is excellent as the embittered Capt. Dan"
2,didn't really get it,"when this came on tv a few weeks ago, i was excited to watch it b/c i knew it was an acclaimed movie, everyone loved it and it won oscars. i was shocked to find that it was just an ordinary movie. it was actually boring. i don't get the hype about this movie. it was a bit sad, and i was on the brink of tears, and tom hanks wasn't that bad in it, but i think it is not at all what people say it is. this is highly overrated."
1,don't change your requirements without warning!,"If the amount wasn't so trivial, I'd consider filing suit against you for services not delivered. I have streamed movies from Amazon before with no issue, but apparently Amazon has recently decided to cut MAC and Linux users out of using their videos and blaming it on a flash update. Clearly, my flash player is not the problem, since I have the most current version of Adobe Flash PLayer. Long story, short -- I'm a little insulted that I received an email asking me how I liked Forrest Gump when I wasn't able to watch it. Thanks for nothing.Sam Elias"
4,Life Is Like A Box a Chocolates!),"Listen to the whole detailed life story of smart-at-heart Forest Gump, told by himself to strangers sittin at a bench with worn out shoes waiting for the bus to visit his first and only love Jenny while holding his box of chocolates and his briefcase with a feather in a childrens book, only to find out Jenny only lives a block away. This truely is a good movie, played very well by Tom Hanks."
4,forrest gump,"I am a Japanese universuty student and I watched ""forrest gump"".The actor talented Tom Hankngss.This movie is about a man who learns many things his life.This movie is excellent.I like the story because character is memorable.I recommend the movie because I change myself view of life."
5,Forrest Gump (1994),"Forrest Gump...what is there to say? Excellent movie. It's seeing history and telling it from a point of view. Many people, who were not in the era, do not realize how everything was, until they see this movie. With history is the whole 'true love' plot, which goes well for the movie. This movie is definitely one of my favorites, my friends and I can remember it word for word and we use many quotes till this day. I highly recommend this movie because of all the great actors, the plot, etc. I look at it as a drama and to me, drama has a little bit of everything in it."
5,"An Inspirational, Heartwarming Movie","This movie was truly inspiring to me. It proved that even those with lower-than-average IQ's can be a success in life, and I'm one of them. I can barely balance a checkbook and my I.Q. is ""dull normal"", but I can spell and type 120-140+ words per minute and I'm very successful in my career as a medical transcripionist. Again, this is a wonderful movie that hubby and I like to watch over and over because it inspires us (we are also both epileptic)."
5,Great movie,Great condition and love this movie. My daughter was excited to watch this classic movie. I'm glad I can share it with her.
5,Upgrade to Blueray version,"I put my standard ""collectors edition"" DVD in my new blueray player and began watching it on my new 1080p LCD. OMG, the picture was so bad. Everything was out of focus, artifacts and noise and who knows what. I think I only managed to watch about 10 minutes. I immediately logged on to Amazon and ordered the blueray version. The blueray version is so much better. So much so that I think a copy of Gump should be included with purchase of every new blueray player sold in the world. This is a no-brainer- if you own a blueray player you MUST own blueray Gump."
5,This movie is fantastic!,I owned this movie on vhs and decided to order it on dvd to watch more often. The loveable Forrest is hard to resist. This movie enables the viewer to get involved with his life struggles and joys. The scenes between him and Lt. Dan are incredible! My family can quote entire scenes from this movie. Love it each and every time I see it. One of the true classics that will live on and on.
5,One of the Greatest Ever,"After recieving this movie and watching it, I was quoting it for the duration of spring break!Great movie.The extras are pretty cool too.Can't beat the Amazon price!"
2,Poor Quality,"The video was not good quality and did not stream well. The connection was not wifi so it should have come through well. I do nothave the same problem with Netflix, but then Netflix doesnt have many instant que options."
1,Worst movie with a budget ever made,"This is one of the most ridiculous and over-hyped movies of all time, and the sole reason I stopped liking Tom Hanks as an actor. Ridiculous accents, too many special effects, unbelievable story.My pick for the worst movie of all time."
1,Forrest Gump,I was never able to watch this movie...for the simple fact that I paid for it and it has not been delivered...I'm still waiting for it's arrival....perhaps you can tell me what has happened to my movie...my patience grows thin.
1,"Generic, uncreative trash.",One word: snoozefest! Watch some real films by Uwe Boll if you want to be entertained.
2,"Good film, but Pulp Fiction was robbed at the Oscars.","Europeans know how to appreciate good films way better than US industry, so it is no surprise that Pulp Fiction won at the Cannes Festival, and Forrest Gump won the Oscar. Don't get me wrong, Forrest is a good film, but Pulp Fiction is one of those films that mark a generation, but it was too ""edgy"" for the Academy.Forrest Gump is not a great movie."
1,"Gag, retch, puke.","Well, I guess it's nice to have a movie for all the rainbow and unicorn loving cat ladies to be in love with. Me? I'd rather watch paint dry."
2,This Movie Gets Old,"The first time I saw this movie I thought it was funny and good to watch. I like and respect all the actors in this movie, and I think this movie was the pivotal point in Tom Hanks acting career, in which he became very diverse and a multi-dimensional actor.I bought this movie thinking I would enjoy it again and again, but some how I find this movie very annoying now. It lost its charm after the first time I saw it. Maybe Forrest is too unbelievably stupid or too lucky."
5,Forrest Gump,"Bought as a gift. Received in good shape. Shipping was a little slow but, it was worth the wait."
3,Forrest Gump DVD Two Disc set,"The product itself was fine, but it took me over 10 days to receive it.Need to improve shipping procedures."
3,"Damon Medic's review of ""Forrest Gump""","Damon Medic says, ""Forrest Gump"" is one strange movie! In one sense, it makes no sense whatsoever, yet in another sense, it is a very deep movie. Forrest is a slightly retarded person, who falls in love with Jenny. Jenny seems to take advantage of Forrest to fulfill her own feeling of desperation. Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, decides at one point, to start walking. As he walks, thousands of people follow him. He has no real reason for walking. It is just something he decides to do for no particular reason. Then one day, he decides to stop. This movie has no real meaning, and rambles from one place to another. It is not good for family viewing, as it has some risque scenes in it that are not appropriate for younger viewers. This is one film that is worth missing.---Damon Medic"
2,incomplete,"I supoused to received the item exactly like show it ,but i only received the dvd and box for it but without the cover like all the original Sapphire series...i already send the request but until now no body answer or send me the cover...I collected the complete Sapphire Series and only the Forrest Gump arrived without cover."
3,This could've been real!,"Forrest gump may have been a good movie but thats no excuse for setting an example that a redneck from alabama turns into all the things fellow people of today wish to do or be. I just don't see how this movie convinces me of believing in a word called luck. For god sake, this movie offened a top preformer, Elvis, and said that he stole the hip swinging from a dumb kid with an IQ of 75. Not real enough but still good to watch if you want to get your mind off the world we live in today and live in a fantasy land like forrest gump did."
1,Am I the only person who hated this?,"I'm sorry but watching this movie was like having a root canal done. I've had more fun watching grass grow. Not only did I feel the storyline was ridiculous and extremely far-fetched, I didn't like nor sympathize for the main character, Forrest Gump. I know that Tom Hanks is very talented and Robert Zemeckis is an accomplished directer, but what were these two thinking. The only person I can half stand in this movie is Sally Field, who I like and respect as an actress, but even her character wears thin. As for this film winning the Academy Award, it is sad because both Little Women and Pulp Fiction were much better films. The Storyline of Forrest Gump is either one you accept or you loathe. Me, I definetly loathed it."
1,Represents all that is wrong with Hollywood,"Possibly the worst in a long list of terrible oscar winners where people voted for what made them feel good - regardless of content. Presents history in a simple minded and one-sided manner and trivialises some of the key events in recent times. The so called inovative editing is a rip off from Woody Allens' far more witty ""Zelig""."
5,why another movie about a slow-witted man?,"I have had people ask why I loved a movie about a mentally challenged man, when that subject has been exhausted in movies.I don't really see this film as a movie about a dumb man.The writer had to have a character without ego or high intellect,and a pure heart, in order to create one of the meaningful points of the story.Forrest goes through a time period of great upheaval, ending up in situations that are a sometimes tragic and sometimes absurd result of ego,greed or power- and it his reaction to it that is important. If you love the idea of heart and humanity unintentionally making us see right through some of the results of lesser characteristics of humanity, you will probably love this film.I thought the original book was excellent too. There is much more detail. For example, the ping-pong and Mao Tsetung part of the story was very funny - some great satire. I highly recommend both those who love this type of story."
5,"Without a Doubt, My Highest 5-Star Rating. One of the Greatest Films I Have Ever Seen.","For a long time, Forrest Gump was just 'that movie my parents like.' I never thought I could get into it. But one day we watched it at school. Put simply, I was blown away. I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of the film didn't interest people. A guy on at a bus stop tells people about his life. But it is so much more than that. Forrest Gump, although long, is never boring. There is always something, whether it be humorous or heart-breaking, going on. Out of all the Tom Hanks films I've seen, this one is by far the greatest. Actually, I'm prepared to say that this is the single greatest performance by an actor I've seen (and I've seen some good ones!). When it's over, you immediately want to watch it again. It's that good. If there's one thing I've learned from this movie, it's this:""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."""
4,Rent Forrest Gump,It was fine.. Good movie.. Best of my life How much longer do I have to say this that is so important to you?
2,It is a movie not worth its hype,"This is the movie that made Hanks famous and also fetched him an academy award. Therefore, I had a lot of expectations going in to watching the movie. At the end of the movie, I realized I had watched a linear narration of a man life from beginning to the end. Though it was interesting to watch, I'm not sure if I would watch it another time."
2,Unpleased,"i love this movie & was looking very forward to watching it & when i got it in the mail it was a Blu-Ray disc which is NOT what is advertised. Instead of the Two-Disc it Showed , i was sent The Movie & the soundtrack which im not too excited about. If i could i'd go back & order the ONE DISC . It didn't even come with as case. Regardless Forrest Gump is a movie i fell in love with & its recommended by me to be watched."
5,Life is like a box of chocolates,Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie. this has to be one of his best performances ever. i love this movie and so will you. recommend it for everyone
3,Forrest Gump,It is one of the greatest movies than I've ever seen BUT it doesn't have spanish subtitles.
5,Tom Hank's debut is wonderful,How does an actor like this ever get a job. The man is just stunning in his perfomance in this movie. The epitome of this movie is just outlined in the back don't let the cover decieve you. This is just another pathetic excuse for a movie that tried to become something big overnight but failed. I seriously don't know of anyone who found this movie even close to amusing I mean common it's just another movie with a guy who has no idea in what era he's living in not to mention the history of his own country. probably the only thing that was somewhat alright was the thought of Gump's father being the creator of the KKK nice little touch up but whatever this movie was terrible in the making
2,"Long, drawn out, doesn't follow book","After reading the book, I wonder how they came up with this movie. Forrest Gump went to outer space and crash landed back on Earth on a deserted island. He got pulled into the space program for throwing his Medal of Honor at the capital and hitting a Senator in the head with it. Anyone who can sit and watch Tom Hanks act like this retard for more than 15 minutes at a time has got to be in a coma."
1,FORREST GUMP SPECIAL COLLECTORS EDITION,I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE AND AM VERY SORRY I DID! NOWHERE ON THE TWO CD'S IS THERE THE MOVIE. ALL TRACKS ARE COMMENTARY. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. THE SECOND DISK HAS THE TRAILERS AND OTHER USELESS GARBAGE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,"Did NOT get the movie, recieved a commentary of the movie!!!!","My son wanted the movie ""Forrest Gump"" fo rhis Bday but recieved a commentary of the movie instead!!! We were both very upset and disappointed!!!"
3,Angel Of Death!,"Some people confuse this film as an all out sugar coated love fest but their are some hints of all out grim reaper in here! For some reason where ever Gump goes so does tragedy! From Jenny, Lieutenant Dan or Bubba to name a few they al seem to have some kind of physical or emotional problem after they meet Gump! I know a story hast to be propelled with drama but to give the central chracter all the best lines and all the best expressions to deal with the ordeals is just plain wrong! Forrest Gump leaves a little murmur in the viewers heart after its all over. But to its credit Gump is a tear jerker at its best. Zemeciks uses digital feathers and faux handicaps to paint a depressing, dark and dank world with only one bright spot and his name is Forrest ""Grim Reaper"" Gump. The film plays on every emotion from adolescence to childhood that the viewer has no choice but to root for the cinema's ultimate dim-witted hero! A good film in its own Gump-ish ways."
2,not that great,"tom hanks in with a typically dull and overrated performance and zemeckis showing off his post-back to the future boringness. very long and tiresome, but not without its moments. very sentimental and some decent special effects. a not so bad performance by gary sinise as well. not worth a watch unless you're really curious what the hype's all about. stick with roger rabbit, used cars, and bttf 1-3"
1,Pointless,"This movie proves along with titanic that people in the 90's have no idea what a great or even good movie looks like. The 1st thing a great movie needs is a story with a point. Just jumping from place to place is beyond dumb, not to mention a man with Gump's IQ making it big in life. But the real reason this movie should never have been made is that it kept the best movie of the 90's (pulp fiction) from winning the awards it should have. In 50 years people will stil talk about Pulp no one will even see Gump."
1,why did this beat pulp fiction?,"Would someone please answer the question above? i had to eat a whole box of chocolates after watching this film to make myself feel better, but it only reminded me of the film. So did what i left in the toilet afterwards. If you havent seen this film count yourself lucky.So if your family is looking to get out a film and want to get this, deny them. Get out blue velvet and watch them cry for all the right reasons, not tom hanks and his web of lies. Cos lets face it, it was pretty obvious that forest was drunk."
1,Just a kind way of making fun of the handicap.,"I only give this movie one star cause I can't give it negative five. I saw this film as a poor excuse to make fun the handicap, having a Father that's handicap, I really didn't find much about this film to my liking. First you've got Jenny who sheilds Forrest in the beginning, shuns him through most of the picture then after realizing she's got A) no where else to turn B) that she's dying, she returns to him. his friend Bubba is slow just like him, what a crazy Idea? His Lutent Dan only really becomes his friend after he himself looses his legs! ..."
1,To the guy that said HD DVD is better quality than Blu Ray,"You're either getting paid to market HD DVD, or you just have no clue.Blu Ray is the better quality and everybody knows it. And to say they the ""sound quality is better,"" is a complete joke."
5,So this is not based on a true story.....,"This is fiction, folks and about as good as it gets! Imagine a simple minded (yet functional) man who sets out to be the best he can be! Okay, so maybe it is over-exaggerated in ways but it is a darn fine film, one full of compassion and love and Tom Hanks has you cheering Forrest on from the very beginning. Gary Sinese is absolutely wonderful as Lt. Dan in this film. The way they were able to modify the old clips to get Forrest in on the action was great. I thought this was a very, very good movie, full of hope and promise and is it wrong for anyone of us to dream? I think not! Sit back, enjoy and remember, it's entertainment!"
3,commentary throughout movie,I have read at least one person had the same problem as we did with there being commentary through out the movie that you could not turn off. After trying and trying my husband finally figured it out. Go into 'setup' and select the ' English 5.1 surround' and that should work. It did for us. :-) enjoy.
5,Forrest Gump is absolute magic,Forrest Gump was a wonderful movie and had a fantastic cast. Certain quotes are so memorable and sometimes you just want to hug Forrest. Forrest Jr was adorable and the movie was wonderful
5,THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"Like the movie Airplane, every time I watch Forrest Gump over again there are always little things that I had not previously noticed. Except unlike Airplane, Forrest Gump combines its humor with real drama and moral statements. Every individual scene is a whole movie and moral in and of itself -- The Value of: Persistemce, Believing in Yourself, Enjoying the Simple Pleasures of Life, Forgiveness, Sacrifice, Duty, Honor, Following Through On Comittments, Helping Others.... I could go on and on. Superbly written and acted. I was ecstatic when the movie and Tom Hanks were appropriately recognized by Oscar."
4,Run Forrest Run,Even though it is a silly story I like it because it is a love story. It touched my heart because of the love!
2,One of the most overrated films of all time,"This film was the most popular with draft-dodging whiners from the 60's. No informed person would be impressed by this condescending, trite, corny, revisionist portrait of a quarter-century of American history. A generation of ignoramuses raised on MTV and the pseudointellectual crowd are its greatest advocates. The same people who consider John Kennedy a great president and Bill Clinton a man."
1,"Not an actual box of chocolates, fyi","Just bought this as a gift for a friend. Maybe somewhere in the product description it should tell that it is not an actual box of chocolates, but rather a scratch and sniff card. How dumb is that? I thought I was sending a thoughtful gift and instead just looked stupid for thinking they were real. No where in the description does it say anything about the chocolates, and the title definitely leads a person to believe that they are actual chocolates. I paid twice as much thinking chocolates would be a nice addition for a gift. No such luck. Extremely disappointed with this order."
5,5 All Ways...,"Hello people, Here we are again and I must begin...Well I just finished w/ a peaceful prayer and moved my room to fit fung-sui! ? I had to buy this one because it was only 9.99 and when it first came out it was 20.00!It makes me lol and get sadness, roller coaster of emotions...Picky Pickles picked on Punks Pueking...hehe?Well I thought in real life that Bubba had a lip problem and I know why the captian says what with your lip, You better tuck it before it gets caught on a wire!From the black panther fight to the cross country soul search was a pleasent movie and can always repeat it?I also feel they painted a picture in our mind and we are the sticky mind. Well I am tired and won't say anything except don't hate on it and make it a 5 star all the way....4.5 stars suck...If it made u feel like me then u owe it to Tom Hanks and cast to quit being cheezy!!!"
2,Voice in the Wilderness,"I guess I'm the only person in the World who didn't like this movie. I am a huge movie fan and generally like Tom Hanks as an actor, but this film just didn't resonate with me. The idea that an individual who is apparently borderline mentally retarded can go on to become a war hero, great athlete, and all around success story seems quite far-fetched to me. Our world is becoming more competitive, not less. A person of his intelligence level would be unlikely to be successful in any one area, much less several. I'm sure this will sound insensitive to some, but it's true! I know this was meant to be a ""feel-good"" movie, but the storyline seemed trite and unbelievable, and the superimposition of the main character into scenes with famous people such as JFK seemed gimmicky."
2,sucked so bad ...,"... come on baby this sucked so bad (sung to the tune of John Cougar's ""hurt so good""). hollywood dragged out every corny stereotype and cliche for this most overrated film. and i've had enough of tom hanks getting paid $15 million per film to tell us how greedy and shallow we all are. give me a break.the only reason i gave it 2 stars was the splicing of actual footage from JFK, Nixon etc. and integrating them as part of the film which was funny at times. otherwise, ""suck so bad ..."""
2,Gets tiring.,"This film could have been good if parts of it were'nt so ridiculous. I can suspend belief for maybe a minute, but not for the whole movie. I am not a Tom Hanks fan, but have seen a few of his films. This is not even one of my favorites of HIS. So, even though its not the worst thing I've ever seen, its still up there as one of the more ridiculous ones."
5,This DVD is like a box of chocolates,"One of the greatest films of all time... and definitely one of the two best Tom Hanks performances EVER! The other, of course, is Philadelphia... with a close third for ""Cast Away"". My opinion, of course.I highly recommend this film for everyone. Male, female; young, old; conservative or liberal. Everyone will find something in this film to relate to and love."
2,Old show,"This is an old show that was well know in it's day, and now is not up to date enough to enjoy. We think at my house it is not a film we need."
2,"Good boxset, but item came damaged","recieved the product, had a hole directly down the middle of box, and the bottom right corner of the box was bent. Very disappointed."
5,"Anthony Michaels review of ""Forrest Gump""","This is an excellent movie. Very well done and put together perfectly. Tom Hanks, as most of the time, does a wonderful job portraying this smart idiot. Also starring Gary Sinse, Robin Wright and Sally Field, this movie is worth the time to watch it, if you don't mind some things like language and partial nudity.ALSO STARRING TOM HANKS:Cast AwayApollo 13Big"
5,Movie that stands the test of time,"Many years and the fact that this movie has been turned into a pop culture touchstone still doesn't diminish it's sweetness. Forrest manages to do what many strive for but few achieve: maintaining a life of peace and simplicity in even the most tumultuous circumstances. He is frequently mistreated and underestimated, but his disability doesn't prevent him from living an extraordinary life of love, loss, war and triumph."
3,Stupid is as stupid does...,"& the over-the-top praise this movie received certainly certifies that bromide. But it has its funny moments, kind of an extended R-rated Gomer Pyle. However it just goes on & on & on & on & on for so long & it slathers on shameful amounts of sentimental goo plus every conceivable film cliche without being in any way witty. Oh well, as my mama used to say, that's just like us, ain't it? It's worth 2 1/2 *s actually."
5,GUMP!,RUN FORREST! RUN!The first time my son watched this film he thought it was about a real dude!Very good movie and Tom Hanks' performance is first rate!
2,"Not particularly good, and certainly not worth all the accolades it received...","This was mildly entertaining. It just seemed like an excuse to play a lot of songs from the 1960's, and for baby boomers to reminisce about historical events in their lives (of which Gump was at all of them). Why this won so many awards is highly questionable. The only reason I can think of is that it's easy and not too controversial; it's the safe choice. The Academy has been known to do that (remember the Crash and Brokeback Mountain controversy?). Tom Hanks really didn't deserve an Academy Award here, not that he isn't a fine actor (he is), but because the performance is not particularly challenging. It's a rather simple performance where he's just playing an ""aw, shucks"" kind of guy. The special FX were really no big deal (even though the press told us they were), and look quite ordinary today. Reportedly, the original novel was much more satritic and darker. I should read it. It's probably better than the film."
1,A babyboomer's wet dream,Forrest Gump was nothing more than an adult baby crib movie produced by a bunch of over-the-hill boomers who still have delerious todler memories of JFK.
1,Stupid is as Stupid does...,"Don't be fooled by the amount of money that this movie made in the box office, it is a major dud. Not only is it offensive to cripples and the handicapped but it just isn't enterntaining! This movie distorts the history of our nation by placing a half witted dunce in some of our countries finest moments. Tom Hanks plays the role of a not so smart man pretty convincingly which makes you wonder. The one bright side to this boring film is the acting of Steven Griffith who plays the role of ""Tex."" I think this film would have been more serious and convincing had Jim Carey played the role of Gump using his Dumb and Dumber character Lloyd Christmas. I do recommend the adult remake of this film ""Forrest Hump."" 1 word ""blahhhh!"""
1,This movies like a box of feces,"The moral of the movie is, being a retard and not understanding life deeply is the key to success. Go ahead, expose your simple emotional buttons to hollywood like the dangling genitals of a circus chimp for so much probing and manipulation. The real subtext here is that the american public, as stupid as gump, brings success to cheap, manipulative hollywood stories."
1,Forrest Dump,"Tom Hanks, the most overrated ""actor"" in hollywood, stars in this piece of tripe about a retarded coming up during the '60s, 70s and 80s. The film, designed to appeal to the Rush Limbaugh crowd, implies that ""dumb is good."" Jenni, Forrest's on again off again girlfriend, represents all the evils of the '60s, while Forrest represents all that is good and true--what a clever binary opposition. Not only is this ""film"" completely odious, you can't imagine how long and drawn out it is unless you've actually had to sit through it, which I don't recommend. I don't know how this piece of trash ever got made. Flush this box of chocalates down the toilet honey, you don't know where they've been!"
5,Best Movie Ever,This is my favorite movie. I believe it's Tom Hanks best performance. I had to own this movie. I could watch it over and over.
4,Not an Oscar worthy performance,"In my humble opinion, Hanks did not earn his Gump Oscar performance. He probably got it just so he could be one of the actors who got back-to-back Academy Awards. The film is good, but not great. It does have an excellent soundtrack going for it, but music does not make a film(unless it's a musical!)The different phases of his life are interesting, as are the special FX. Gary Sinise puts in a great performance as Lt. Dan. The film touches on fragile subjects: Vietnam, AIDS, and treats them well."
2,overrated,"This is by far the most overrated movie of the 90s. Tom Hanks' Oscar win for best actor was nothing less than a travesty. There is nothing particularly bad about this film, but there is not much about it that is great either. I was somewhat interested in what happened to Gump, but when it came right down to it, he could have been hit by a bus and it would have been all the same to me. There was no emotional connection to the characters."
3,Arrived Opened,"I love this movie, but I only have to complain about the way the package arrived. The blu ray box arrived already opened--without the plastic wrapping!!! It didn't even ship with a receipt!!!!!! How am I supposed to return or exchange it?! I just hope it's a new disc and not a used one because I paid for the new version sold by Amazon. If everything is fine, I guess it's okay... I'm just really surprised Amazon either gave me a used one or forgot to wrap it? :/"
3,Tom Hanks at his best,"This was one of my favorite movies of the 90s tom didn't a combination of serious acting from philaphelia and comedy from big and put it together boom a instant classic this movie was funny and serious at the same time with a little emotion in the mix this movie made or elevate not only tom hanks career but sally field's robin wright penn's and gary sinise's careers as the picture was amazingly clear the time limit was just right this movie was like a book that took me on an adventure i love the song it had the movie had sort of like a heaven feel to it again tom hanks acting in this movie was top notch one of the best actin i have seen since rainman, scarface, and sling blade"
2,BORING!!!!,"Why does everyone love this movie? It must have been one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The reason why I did not care for the movie at all was because it had no plot. There was no point to the movie at all. The film was just about this nerdy guy running around and getting beat up on by bullies, while being felt sorry for by everyone else. Is this the type of film that is supposed to keep me riveted on the edge of my seat? The only reason it got 2 stars from me is because I have respect for Tom Hanks as an actor in better movies such as ""Big."""
2,One of the most overrated films in recent years.,"I suppose I am in the minority, but I felt this was one of the most overrated films in recent years. It was a depressing movie and seemed to send a message that if you are a simpleton, you will also live the American dream. I thought Hanks gave a good performance, but gave better ones in ""Philadelphia"",""Apollo 13"", and most recently in ""Saving Private Ryan"". How this has become a classic shows just how few original films are being made in the 1990's."
1,Gift set is garbage,"Fantastic movie. Awful gift set. I completely regret my decision to purchase the gift set. No blu-ray case for the movies, gigantic box, nothing worth the extra money. I'm mad at myself for ordering this. Get the normal blu-ray with case instead."
5,THE BEST FILM EVER MADE,"The first time I saw this film, I was amazed beyond beleife. Tom Hanks is outstanding as Forest Gump, and every sapporting actor was perfect for the role. This movie has so many memorable lines in it, its almost insane. This movie is almost a modern day Rocky, in which it shows what one man could do with his life, and what we should do with our lives. Easily deserved every reward it got."
5,Forrest Gump on Blu Ray,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said , I saw Forrest Gump when first released & thought it was Great so bought a copy from Amazon on Standard DVD with a good picture & sound and now again on Blu Ray Sapphire Series with a clearer picture & sound a winner of 6 academy awards Including Best Picture , released in 94 with a great performance by Tom Hanks and cast a PG 13 rated film and a good copy Recommended ."
5,A modern classic,"What else can be said about Forrest, Forrest Gump? This movie is a modern classic. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then what the heck are you waiting for?"
5,"Run, run and make your dreams come true!","This singular picture was a superb surprise in that time. Zemckis masterpiece turns around the life and times of an elemental man who lives according fundamental schemes but ignoring all the vices and prejudices, acts and shines in the universe of the double moral and accustomed pattern behavior, so typical in us.Indeed, the life is a chocolat box, and that ineffable premise will lead him to elevate the moral and self steem not only about him but the rest of his beloved friend along his existence.Drama and humor share its right place in this jeweled and admirable artistic movie that has become in a cult movie in just eleven years.Hnaks is simply overwhelming, and so Gary Sinise.Go for this inspired picture, without reserves."
5,Most Beautifully Done,"A beautiful movie about the story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a simpleminded yet strangely wise gentle man, and his journey through growing up in a small town in Alabama in the 1950's, as a football hero at college and soldier in Vietnam in the 1960's , a table tennis champion, shrimp boat captain, company director , and cross country runner in the 1970's , the movie takes us through these wonderful times , and Gump's wonderful relations with all who he comes into contact with , especially his mother (Sally Fields) , his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curren (Robin Wright) , his army buddy Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and his other army buddy Lt Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).Filled with tragedy and triumph, Gump also meets Elvis Presley, John F Kennedy, George Wallace, John Lennon and Richard Nixon.It is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit-most beautifully done."
4,Love this movie,"Forrest Gump is a great movie, one of the classics in movie history, and one of the biggest box-office greats, it gets 4 stars because of the movie, minus one because of the DVD, from how of a wait it was to wait for this DVD, it could have been way better, it's good if you VHS version is breaking but not good if you just want it because you're expecting the greatest DVD."
5,Best movie ever!!!!!!!,Forrest Gump is the best movie ever made.There has not been a movie made of this caliber since or ever will be.
5,A Must Buy for All Who Own A DVD Player,"Tom Hanks successfully protrays a borderline-retarted boy growing up in Alabama. This story brings both laughter and tears, and successfully shows the struggle that Forrest has faced throughout his life. This DVD set also contains a second CD in which life through the eyes of Forrest is portaryed, and the actors in the film give comments. This DVD is worth the money!"
5,A Classic film on Simple Life,Forrest Gump is a great story teller. It not only tells the story of one man's adventure. But the entire story of growing up American.
5,A Sure Classic,"This movie just hits home with every single viewer. It is a beautiful movie, about the impact that a ""stupid"" man had on society. It was just amazin"
4,Dark but hopeful,"This is actually quite a depressing story about what has gone wrong in America over the past few decades, but the agreeable Hanks survives it all somehow, with a few moments of humor. Mostly I feel drained after seeing this."
2,Zelig & Being There,"Higly overated, this sentimental flick is part Zelig, part Being There--minus the irony, honesty, or wit of either. While it had some fine acting, a decent (though wierdly predictable) soundtrack, and even a few memorable moments, the praise that was heaped on Gump was so undeserved, I thought, that finally watching this ""great movie"" in the theater and having to sit through the standing ovation at the end was a little nauseating--literally."
5,I bought this accidentally...,"...but I find no reason to regret!Yes, I heard about this film already years ago. Just I did not find the time to see it. In fact, in '94 I was going through some equally unbelievable happenings as the main character in this film.My advice: Get it!"
3,"Picture quality is better than DVD, but below Blu-ray standards",These are my picture quality impressions on the Blu-ray version of Forrest Gump shapphire edition.Picture quality is better than DVD and below Blu-ray.I definitely saw an improvement in picture detail and clarity compared to the DVD version when playing both on my PS3 console outputting to a 46 inch plasma 1080p HDTV. I can easily read the words on signs in the movie. Just don't expect it look like a movie shot for HD release. A worthy upgrade from DVD if you enjoy re-watching this movie like I do.
5,Great Film,"Not one I can watch over and over, but every few years this one really one calls out to my heart."
4,Good movie,"Love this movie, Tom Hanks and Sally Field are stellar!! It is a long movie though so as much as I like it I can only watch it a few times a year. Gotta love Bubba Gump Shrimp Co :)"
5,Must have in collection,"My God, if you don't have this classic of a movie in your collection what the hell is wrong with you. I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks and I thought he did a superb job of playing Forrest Gump. If you thought this movie was dumb or just plain stupid, you have issues that should be dealt with right away. I was about 14 or 15 years old when this movie came out and even then as a young teenage girl, I knew that this movie would be a classic."
2,Language,Because I needed dubbed in Spanish or with Spanish subtitles on the Amazon site says Dubbed: Spanish but not true.
5,Very Neat,"I love this movie, I had to buy this collectors thing. The box is awesome, the book is amazing, the scratch and sniff chocolates are sweet, but the feather inside makes no sense."
5,thays all i got to say about that,This is one Tom Hanks most memorable roles. I have had the VHS of this since it first came out. I don't watch it as much as I would like so I decided to buy it in DVD. You can't beat the price on Amazon. Thanks Amazon.
5,An instant classic,"Forrest is basically a good guy, he just happens to be kinda slow. But that doesn't seem to stop him from meeting Elvis, fighting in Vietnam, Investing an apple and founding a multimillion dollar shrip company.Tom Hanks is brilliant and he plays the part wonderfully. Although some elements of the book that I would have liked to see were not included it still does not take away from a wonderful proformance. This movie will have you laughing and crying at the same time."
4,I guess some folks just don't get it...,"... I believe that it was made for us aging baby boomers. The film had outrageous explanations for everything from the smiley face (Have a nice day!) to ""... Happens!"" The world did indeed revolve around Forrest Gump. It was not political commentary or making fun of handicapped people..it was fairly obvious that she was supposed to have had one of the first cases and they had not developed the neat acronym yet.Everyone is entitled to their opinion. If you like movie magic, are a baby boomer and have not seen this film, throw down your dough, make some popcorn, relax, turn up the TV... enjoy the story and music - just have a few hankies around - you will probably need them!"
5,Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump,"Forrest Gump is not just a movie it is a history lesson covering famous american events from the 50's into the 90's. The thing i love the most about this film is forrest's down to earth and innocent personality. it's hard to beleive this is just a film and it is greatly down to Tom Hanks's exceptionally performance which I think can sit comfortable amongst the best ever. To me the music also plays a big part in the movie with classy tunes from the last 50 years.My favorite scenes in this movie are when Forrest begins to run for no reason and when forrest is introduced to forrest junior. If you haven't seen this movie then you cannot consider yourself a true movie expert, so go to your local rental shop and you will see what I mean."
4,What!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!/,this isnt so much a review as a question what is that 60's song that plays when forrest goes to Vietnam is really famous but i dont know what it is. please reply its drivin mme crazy!ps. excellent movie
1,poor video quality,"Amazon prime instant video had very grainy images. Very poor video quality. I have always enjoyed the movie itself, but I just can't watch it through the instant video option because of the poor streaming quality."
3,Idolizing an idiot,"I agree with the reviewer below. this movie was okay and ""Pulp Fiction"" should've won. By the way, ANYBODY could've played the Forest Gump character, it's not a hard role to act out. Why would you make a movie about an idiot? It's way too overrated."
3,An overrated movie that's really forgetable,"Forest Gump is a movie about a young man named Forest and he has a fair life with his mother. Then he meets Jenny who he becomes best freinds with. He graduates from college and joins the army and marries Jenny. It is fair to watch, but not great."
1,Pure vomit.,"The first time I saw this movie, I was privilaged to have seen it for free. Thank God. It was the most insipid tripe ever put on screen. Despite having paid nothing to see it, I was non-the-less sorry to have wasted my eyesight on this piece of retard-O dung. It was little more than a trivial carnival ride through the 60's, 70', and 80's, that served only to assure a bunch of jerk-off baby boomers that they were the only generation who ever existed. What a waste. Steer clear of this box of chocolates... you might wind up with a rude surprise."
1,It Stinks!,"The movie is fast paced and pretty entertaining. However, as a form of art, I thought the movie really [wasn't]. Tom Hanks does a superb job of acting stupid and the movie doesn't seem to have any real message. The real problem is that the Forest Gump character is very annoying and once you notice this, the movie really starts to have a grating sensation (fingernails on a chalkboard type stuff)."
5,Endearing portrayal of True Love and Power of Positive,"Such a beautiful movie - reminds you of the power of a positive frame of mind and the security of a love that does not waver. Every time I catch this movie I leave the experience a better person, even if only for a few hours or days. Will be a true classic - its themes are timeless"
2,Overrated; Hollywood is not a place to make you think,"I was very disappointed when I finaly saw this movie because everyone said how nice it is. But it is made of typical Hollywood lies about life. The creeple, with a good heart you'll find happiness and love anyway."" poor, then being happy is only possible in stupid Hollywood movies."""
5,i love it,"but one thing i find wrong with this film....it does seem to linger, or feel too long. no matter how many times i watch it, after he goes on the run across america, i tend to tune out from there to the end."
2,Forrest Goofball,"I don't want to slam this movie, but I just don't understand why so many people like goofy, cute stories like Forrest Gump. It was so far-fetched for me that I never watched it again. It was not quite as bad as The Terminal.Like the reviewer below me said, this movie beat out The Shawshank Redemption at the Oscars. Unbelievable."
5,I Actually Found The Movie On The Discs....,"I usually don't write reviews, but I sort of wanted to write one in response to the person from Whippany, NJ who said he couldn't find the movie anywhere on the two discs! Is this person for real? What in God's name is he doing? He does have a DVD player, yes? He's not attempting to view these discs with a VCR, is he? My God. Anyway, for the rest of you who have no trouble operating a remote control, this is a fantastic film. Obviously. Come on, it's ""Forrest Gump."" Possibly the most enjoyable film ever made. It's just optimism and love run amok. Great cast. Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are a perfect odd couple, and Robin Wright-Penn is stunning, even when she's doped-up and cracked-out in the 1960's. Leonard Maltin doesn't know what he's talking about in saying he didn't buy Hank's performance. Well, I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion. I think, in most everyone's opinion, ""Forrest Gump"" is a great American film. When you can find it."
5,Good Book,"My niece loves it. Wish some more of the illustrations were in color, but good gift for somebody from Texas."
3,"Great illustrations, story not what I was hoping for","I was hoping for a story line with a little more zip, something more like the Irish Night Before Christmas or the Cajun Night Before Christmas. The illustrations are wonderful, the story is nothing special. Same old Night Before Christmas with a mild twist."
5,A great true crime reference book,This easy to read and well-organized book is one of the best crime reference books ever published. Its scope is huge. Using the index you can follow the careers of hundreds of famous or even little known criminals. The authors coverage of different subjects is also excellent. I highly recommend this book.Jeffery King. author of The Life and Death of Pretty Boy Floyd and The Rise and Fall of the Dillinger Gang.
3,I Am NOT That Impressed,"I cannot get on the bandwagon of praise for this work. Perhaps I was expecting more, but received less. It is interesting, but really nothing new, or nothing that I did not know before. There are a few photos I never saw before, so that is a treat; however, the authors seem to concentrate on Al Capone, and he is pervasive throughout the book, giving other gangsters less. There is an alphabetical listing of MOST gangsters; I say most, as not all, not the majority, are listed, and as for the molls, a couple of very, very brief pages and nothing of much substance.The book is a large volume, but not very deep. Thankfully, I bought it for a ridiculously low price. I will gladly resell it. Not recommended."
1,No depth at all.,"This is just facts tossed between covers, that's all it is. There is nothing new or interesting here and frankly, the book should come with a warning that it isn't actually story telling it's a bunch of facts between covers. No depth at all."
5,It's a crime not to have this book!,"Not much can be added to previous reviews. This updated edition has given my earlier dog-eared copy a rest. For anyone who does any kind of Prohibition era crime research, this book is a must have by two of the masters in this field. The most complete compendium of crime information from that period available today. Whether you research or just enjoy reading about crime, this book is tops."
3,"Worth a Read, Nothing More","A detailed gangland almanac, to be sure, containing plenty of information and rare photographs. I'm not being facetious here, but I felt that the best part of this book was its extensive bibliography and the authors' mini reviews of the various publications cited therein."
2,Not Very Impressed,"Didn't care too much for this book. I was expecting more. Not nearly enough photos. A lot of worthless information and not enough ""good stuff""."
3,A Unique Approach to Iranian Nationalism,"Make that rating 3.5 stars. This book's effort to examine the rise of Iranian natoinalism in terms of land and cartography are unique. The author takes the ""Map"" of Anderson's ""Census, Map, and Museum"" and runs with it. The *frictions* on its borders arising from international intrigue, from the Qajars to the Pahlavis, set the stage for *fictions* of nationality and unity. Of course, as any specific book like this would be, it can be quite dry. At no time is it @ all exhilirating. I would recommend it only for those highly interested in studying modern Iran and how modern historiography is to be applied to examining its birth."
4,Live from another level....wonderful CD,This is a valuable purchase and a wonderful CD. Her I am to Worship is one of my favorite songs and makes the purchase of the CD totally worth it. What a blessing and wonderful addition to my gospel collection. Daddysgirl
4,Nicely done,"I bought this cd for my mother who is an Israel fan, and she loves it! She plays the album in her car, and she worships while on her way to work. I actually purchased two of Israel's cds at once, and she can't get enough of either."
5,I can't say enough,"If you don't have this yet you are missing out! I can't put into words how awesome this cd actually is. The 1st disc will have you jumping around the room. From song #1 to the last track it is tight. The music is 2nd to none, and the songs will bare witness to your soul. The 2nd disc Israel slows it down, and just opens up in worship and praise. This cd shouldn't be recommended, it should be doctor prescribed...Medicine for your soul!BrentTopeka, KS"
4,great,I have had this in my past moving caused me to misplace it. I truely enjoyed early 2000 when I first had.
5,Soldout,This album really stirs the atmosphere for pure worship. Israel Houghton did it again. I play this everyday in my car and let the wonderful medleys speak to my spirit!
5,Definitely another (higher) level!,"I became familiar with Israel Houghton & New Breed 2 years ago with the ""New Season"" album. Being a worship leader and praise band musician/arranger for 30 years, I was blown away with the spirit and the musicianship level...something I've always believed God wanted me to aspire to (see Psalm 33).I couldn't wait for the next offering of praise & worship from Israel & New Breed. Then ""Another Level"" came...and, believe me, they've taken worship music to the highest level I've seen (in my opinion). This album (and new DVD) is musically and spiritually amazing! As Israel states about the music in one of the songs, ""it ain't a black thing, it ain't a white thing, it ain't even about the color of your skin..."" I am a middle-aged caucasian, but I'd rather think of myself as light-brown!Blessings on all who listen!!"
5,"Spicy, great smell",I originally bought a bottle of this years ago and made this purchase as a gift for a friend. He tried some of mine and it made a big hit with his girlfriend. I am not a match-maker.
1,Please don't buy it my wife love this fragance and I don't want anybody using it! What I can say!!,I used Nicole Miller 15 years ago and she loved it. This cologne got something that woman like it and I don't know what it is but I always got good compliments. I recently purchased another bottle very cheap... so don't buy it leave it on the market for me. Thank's
4,I like it,Always been a fan of Nicole Miller's men's products. I have a few of her ties. I like this fragrance. It's subtle and not overpowering.
4,Original...almost to a fault.,"This guy is not your average Matchbox 20 rock star. He sings really cool rocks songs, but his voice is very different...you can't describe it. It's not bad, but not usual. He can sing hard rock or sentimental songs, pretty good. Buy it, unless you don't buy anything but the normal rock."
1,"Stinks, felt it was a waste of money","I bought this game because the guy in the store told me that it was cool, he said it was like Myst, that it was not. I did not like this game. Sound stinks, graphics stink. I cant belive sierra put this one out, usually their games rule, like Hlf-Life, and SWAT, I thought this was a dissappointment."
3,doesn't work for windows xp,"The Gabriel knight I game will not install into windows xp because you can't make 256 color, but the gabriel kight II game will so if you want to buy it for only the one game the second one will work."
3,GK2 WAS GOOD BUT...,"I found this game at a store and decided to buy it because I recently finished GK3 and was curious about the 2 games. Now, I've had a lot of problems with Sierra in the past. For example, every game I got, broke down because the CD was screwed up. So I installed GK1 and right after ""Day 1"" appeared on the screen I recieved an error message. I was never able to fix it. But, later when I but on GK2, it worked perfectly. That's what hate about Sierra. But GK2 is a great game and I recommend it any one who is as in to Adventure games as me."
3,An impressive collection of a small number of games!,"The Gabriel Knigth games, while they don't exactly represent Sierra's finest work, are among some of the most interesting and compelling adventure games released in the post text-parser world. Both games--Sins of the Father and The Beast Within--have some excellent moments, and offer more extensive and more interesting play time than you will find in many modern-day adventure games. If you aren't familiar with the series, or you want the games to keep, you should definitely consider this package."
1,was not to crazy about this game,"I was not to crazy about the beast within game, it is not to exciting and I found it to be boring."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING,Is this a misprint ??? 88 bucks for a little 1/2gallon bowl?? This cant be right... must be wrong in ad
2,"Okay quality for price, but not as pictured.","While the bowl I received served the purpose it was intended for (serving gummy fish at my daughter's party), it looks completely different than the pictures in the listing. It is flat on the bottom and on the side so it can sit upright and at an angle. Which was fine, luckily, but it would have been a problem had it been intended for actual fish or something that I wanted the bowl to look symmetrical. The bowl itself is decent quality for the price, and had a plastic lid, which came in handy keeping our candy fresh. But again - was expecting something different. So just be aware, the product I received does not look anything like the bowl pictured and you may get the same."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! THIS IS ANIMAL CRUELTY!,"These small containers are terrible. The fish has no room to swim, ammonia builds up, water parameters get messed up, the temperature gets messed up, etc. Please get your fish a proper aquarium set-up, as your fish will thank you."
5,A fascinating confabulation,"I readBlind Date (Kosinski, Jerzy)11 years ago, and now I realize the only other book that somehow comes close to it in terms of absurdity isXavier Decides to Stop A Killing: A Novel. Don't get me wrong--Blind Date is amusing and you just can't stop wanting to find out would happen next, but Xavier also seems to stew in the same pot of human perversion and existential absurdity. I suggest read Blind Date then read Xavier Decides to Stop a Killing and see the parallels."
1,pointless,"Having read all the reviews, I expected something completely different. I read the Painted Bird a long time ago, and I loved it. Being There was pretty good also, although, I found the movie better. But Blind Date - it feels like I read a different book than all other reviewers.""Erotically charged?"" - only if you find incest (with own mother, no less) and rape erotic. ""Idea man, [...] international playboy?"" - I found Levanter rather dull.I have to admit that I find Kosinski's language mesmerizing in its simplicity, but, combined with this unemotional narration, it did not work for me in Blind Date. This novel, just like the Steps, is told in vignettes. This concept never really appealed to me. This time it felt like an easy excuse to... perhaps not having much to say?I don't see much redeeming value here. Blind Date alternates between being gratuitously shocking, and boring. At this point, I'm not sure I want to read more by Kosinski..."
3,Kosinski attacks America...again.,"""Blind Date,"" by Jerzy Kosinski, is coca-cola for the mind. You sip a little at a time and ponder the after-taste. All in all, the book serves its purpose, which is to involve the reader with quick flashes of whit and brutal irony. But my personal opinion is that the chapters repeat themselves in their psydo-philosophical/psychological ""victim""/""avenger"" theme. Thus, ""Blind Date"" quickly grows predictable, even a litte lame, and fails as a collective-whole. This is a book that is quickly read and quickly forgotten, but it's fun, if you don't take it too seriously, which you shouldn't."
5,"Better than Illmatic, (you heard me right!)","This classic has it all, from knocking beats, to street anthems, to a classic diss song ""The Message"" which rips 2pac to shreds! Anyways, this album was hated on by some purists because they didn't feel as though it lived up to the expectations after ""Illmatic"". But real hip hop heads know that this album is one of the top five albums of all time!"
4,Simply ILL,"Now that years have passed on this album, I can appreciate it much more. Gems such as: ""The Message"", ""I Gave You Power"", ""Nas Is Coming"", ""Watch Dem Niggas"", and ""Suspect"" made this album truly a great follow-up to the timeless classic ILLMATIC. Let's break it down on why the lyrical prowess of Nas is so incredible. For example, ""I Gave You Power"" has Nas rapping from the aspect of a gun. Not even Hova(or any rapper for that matter) was advanced enough to think of something on that level at that time. Then here comes ""Suspect"", which I call the ""lost"" ILLMATIC track. This track was a heavy throw-back to ILLMATIC, Nas comes equipped with the vivid lyrics that gave him the title as being the ""Second Rakim"" in the first place. While L.E.S.'s beat brings the 94' flavor that made Nas's flow sound even more vicious. True it was evident that Nas no longer wanted to be Nasty and cross over to a larger scale of success, but it was good to see that he still had the heart of a street disciple."
5,Another classic!,"Im sick of everyone saying Nas sold out on this album. How do you figure? As far as I know this is his most in tune to real life album he made. Also on this album he seems to add more detail to whatver he is talking about. ""The Message"" is my personal fav on this one. Lines like The highlights of living, vegas style roll dice in linen, antera's spinning on milleniums 20g bets i'm winning them, threats i'm sending them, lex with t.v. set the minimum, i'll sex adrenaline. ""I gave you Power"" he talks about being used in a gun perspective. This album just like illmatic has too many jewels to name but if you want to hear a real album from a real rapper that didn't sell out pick this up."
4,Tight album,I liked this album it's got guest apperances from cormega mobb deep some really good gangsta tales. the bad part is it's a little commercialized
4,Epitome of Nasdom,This is probably his best work to date-which isn't to say it will be his best ever. My favorite track is Black Girl Lost because he went under her skirt on that one. He originated the gun/man metaphor with I Gave You Power.. that's nasty. Street Dreams is treacherous.. the beat is sick and his delivery is mad. Affirmative Action is ill.. you get a taste of The Firm on that. But.. my favorite song isn't the best song.. If I Ruled The World stands alone on this album.. he smashed that track--Lauren Hill only enhances the melody.. He elevated the content (no disrespect to Kurtis Blow). All in all.. the CD is worth having in your inventory. If it's not already a classic.. it will be soon.
4,"Not Illmatic, but still a strong album","It was written was a pretty strong follow up to the 94 classic ILLMATIC. As always Nas delivers with sharp lyrics and creativity, as heard on tracks like ""I gave you power"", where he raps from the perspective of a handgun. The track, which was produced by DJ Premier, shows the chemistry between Nas & Premo. My only gripes with the album are that certain tracks could've used better production, such as the Dre-produced ""Nas is coming"" in which I thought would've been better considering the track record of the legendary west coast producer. Also, the song ""Silent Murder"", which was included on the cassette version is not included on the cd. But still I would say that this is one of the best albums in the Nas catalog. My personal favorite songs: ""Street Dreams"", ""I gave you Power"", ""Black Girl Lost"", ""Live N*gga Rap"", & ""The Message""."
5,Nas - It Was Written,"Classic debut by Nas. He does it once again with his second public release. This album is not as grimey as ""Illmatic"" but its grimey enough and Nas rhymes are iller than ill. Nas is one of those rappers that will NEVER dissapoint lyrically. He was known on ""Illmatic"" for having such complex rhymes, but on ""It Was Written"" hes lyrical again, while touching real street topics and spittin real life. Much respect due to Nas. I recommend if your new to Nas, then buy ""Illmatic"" first. THEN buy this!! You wont be dissapointed. This album is really good production and GREAT lyrics. Go pick this album up now. Real hiphop support.My Top 5 Songs1.The Message2.I Gave You Power3.Nas Is Coming4.The Setup5.If I Ruled The World"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS ILLMATIC,"LET ME TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING,ILLMATIC WILL NEVER BE REPEATED AGAIN BY NAS.THE FIRST FIVE SONGS IS EXCELLENT BUT TRACKS LIKE WATCH DEM NIGGAS,BLACK GIRL LOST AND SUSPECTS ARE GARBAGE MOMENTS OF THIS ALBUM.THE JEWELS ARE I GAVE YOU POWER(IN WHICH NAS IS THE GUN)THE FIRM(WHICH INTRODUCES ME TO FOXY BROWN EVEN THOUGH THE FORMULA WAS SMOOTHE DA HUSTLERS)LIVE NIGGA RAP."
5,Classic,"Nas, what happened? ""It was written"" is hands down the best Nas album ever and one of the top rap albums ever as well. Everything in this CD is great, but Nas seemed to stop being Nas after this album, mostly because of his beat changes. Nas's lyrics aren't anything without Nas's beats, and this and Illmatic are the only album where that shows."
3,An ok effort,"""It was written"" is a decent effort from Nas, when i first purchased it a few years back, i was expecting a bit more. Being that its' hard to find some decent hip-hop now-a-days i found myself digging it out the crates. I must admit it has some hot tracks, however its no where close to ""illmatic""."
3,from champ to chump,"How in the hell can Nas come out with Illmatic then put out this shining example of mediocrity? An obvoius example of selling out, children. Buyer beware."
4,nasty nas,now im a fan of NaS and i love him (ask my boyfriend) this is one of my favorite albums by him. his lastest has to be my all time favorite i could listen to that album front to back. he's a true emcee. he has pure talent. i've been a fan for years and i think he fell of with nastradamus but everyone has at least one album that aint their best
5,Nas's Sophomore Masterpiece,"AfterIllmaticwas released Nas became the new it rapper. Everyone loved the CD. Yes, it is one of the ten greatest rap CD's of all time, but some of those people sleep on his second release. The classic It Was Written. The CD is equally as impressive as his debut but just short of th masterpiece status. It's not as concise, and some songs seem to not fit, but otherwise definitely one of the best.My favorites include The Message (must hear), I Gave You Power, Take It In Blood, Nas Is Coming, Black Girl Lost, Suspect, Live Nigga Rep, and IF I Ruled the World.Definitely Highly recommended. Must Have even."
5,One of the Greatest,Nas reaches deep into his soul and this album embodies his inner voice. 'The Message' is a very powerful track.
4,The Return Of Nas,"The year is 1996, hip hop's darkest era. Nas was representin' QB at the time with his fellow comrades, AZ, Mobb Deep, Cormega and Nature. This album was the transformation of Nas as he formed The Firm, with AZ, Nature/Cormega & Foxy Brown. This album may not be Illmatic, but still deserves recoginition. The production was tight and the MC talent was all there. The only disapointing thing about the album is the track, ""Nas Is Coming"". Since the track was produced by Dre, you'd expect better production, other than that, the album is still good. Nas drops his nasty persona and begins to make the pathway to Escobar."
5,Beginning to end - terrriffic,"I purchased IT WAS WRITTEN mainly because I liked the crisp backup of Lauyn Hill on ""If I ruled the world"". After listening, I might be able to say that has become my least favorite song. This should not detract from that song, but it should contribute to the quality of the album in its entirity. Possible the greatest Rap song of all time is ""The Message"" the repetitive guitar licks were a huge inovation, and you notice similar music pervading the rap and R&B area today. Affirmative action is a very solid song, one that is rarely mentioned. The hard and sweet words of Foxy Brown laced with the powerful beats provide a little lift in the middle of the album. ""Street Dreams"" is one of the singles released and I thought was outclassed by many other songs on the album, although it is catchy. Overall this ablum provides the pop sound and thoughtful lyrics that club-goers and rap professionals would both love."
5,It Was Written '96,"This is by far one of Nas' greater albums. On albums intro you can hear words of introspect from Nas and rhyme partner, AZ, and then the party starts on the track ""The Message"" where Nas spits fire all over the classic N.Y. beat. Songs like ""Affirmative Action"", ""Live Nigga Rap"", ""If I Was a Gun"", and ""Black Girl Lost"" are all certified bangers. Featuring artists and producers such as Havoc and Prodigy (Mobb Deep), Foxy Brown, Dr. Dre, Cormega, AZ, and Trackmasters, this is an album you'll be bumping for a long time."
4,The great Nasir Escobar has not fallen off.,"Yo! how can these guys sit and say that the supreme nas escobar has fallen off.For one he is the second greatest lyricist next to the man himself Rakim.Though i admit that his last album was not as great as illmatic it came mighty close. He's not that hungry thug robbing n*ggas to eat.Because he grew as a person and started rapping about other things like spending money,getting women,and driving fly whips.Cats say he fell off cause he stopped talking about the same things like so many other rappers.The rap game is like the crack game if you don't change your look,your game,and you start doing the same things consistently you get caught.Nas where ever you are i'm definitely feeling you.But man all this waiting for ""I AM..""is crazy."
3,knowlege is power,"At this time in nas is career he had disagreements wit both legends pac and big, although this album is worth it. songs that i found interesting was i gave you power and the message are classics. on a scale from 1 to 10 i give this album a 7..."
3,Nasty Nas Is Dead,"I'm extremely disappointed in this sophmore album by Nas. He had potential to be in the top 3 of illest MCs of all time. The last time he wrote some dope rhymes was in ""Verbal Intercourse"". He does have some gems on this album no doubt. But he fell of Queensbridge and hit his head hard. Now a new era is born of Nas Escobar, which is the personification of wackness."
3,nas fell off,"Conforming to current hip hop trends Nas fails us. He has lost touch with what made him a star; His lyrics.Now he is a Godfather, pimp, pseudo Biggie smalls with out the flow , appeal or dough."
2,Disagre wit' all of ya,"Naaah, I don't understand none of you. For me it's decent joint, with some brilliant moments, like Message. He have done much more better than this, befo' (classic Illmatic) and later (whatever w/o Nastradamus)."
2,What,You people cannot be serious . Illmatic was 100 times better than this . If i ruled the world sucks too. Sampling a beat form Whodini. Cd is weakkkkkkk. Pick up Illmatic or Gods son . Those are good this one isn't though.
2,Nas fell off.,"I'm not going to go into depth about this album, but it has to be said that Nas has officially fallen off. He went from hip-hop innovator to hip-hop imitator. If I hear one more artist talk about the mafia... Like Cormega said, ""Talkin' about street dreams wearing a pink-ass suit."""
4,Future Rock Star,"We gave this guitar to my granddaughter for Christmas. She just loved it. It's bright, fun & easy to use. Wouldn't have traded it for anything...the look on her face when she opened it was priceless."
1,Never worked,"I just bought this for my three year old's birthday and had to return it because it never worked properly. I had planned to exchange it, but the manager pulled two others off the shelf and neither of those worked properly either. He said it was probably a manufacturers defect. I was very disappointed because it was so cute and my daughter loved it when she opened it. Now we have to try to find a replacement."
2,Not working after 1 month,"We got this guitar for my 4 year old, she loved it, but it stopped functioning after less than a month, I thought I need to change batteries but even after that it didn't work, now I don't know what to do with it, I didn't keep the box so that I could return it, very disappointed..."
1,Defective straight out of box,"My daughter is almost three, and she was so excited when she received this for Christmas. Unfortunately, the strings do not work, and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and/or chords, and they don't work, either. I was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this, and I was so disappointed when Amazon responded there are no replacements available. I'm going to see if the manufacturer can replace it."
1,Wish I had checked these reviews first,I bought this guitar for my 3 year old daughter who is crazy about the Disney Princess line. All the features worked except for the string feature. At this price I expect it to work properly so I took it back and exchanged it for another one. Again we had the same problems with the new one. I guess I'll take it back and try another brand.
2,Wish i would have bought something else!,"So, the only thing my 3 year old really wanted for Christmas was a guitar and unfortunately I chose this. The strings make no sounds, the ""buttons"" up and down the neck make no sounds and basically you have three irritating choices of songs and for me to say that is something, since every toy I own ""sings"" and none of them bother me!I'm actually going to look for something else...I'm that bummed with it...and so is she! Oh well!"
5,"Stellar, eclectic compilation","I have had this CD for years, and each and every song is amazing! I was shocked that all these great acts came from Dallas, a city I grew up in and always thought was stupendously dull. Anyway, there is a great mix of stuff on here. The Vibrolux song is incredible, and I'm still sad I've never been able to find any of their albums in print. The Old 97's W.I.F.E. is hilarious, especially considering they must have been about 17 when they wrote and sang it. The Fuzz songs are supremely idiotic--who the hell are these guys--they are nuts! The Cowboys and Indian's cover of Hank Williams Roly Poly is great (a song I now sing to my son). The old blues guy singing about his mother is amazing... check out his story. Brave Combo is amazing. The music is very diverse, so the tracks don't really mesh with each other necessarily, but everything on here is excellent. I wish this CD packaging had become an annual tradition."
3,never got it from the bookstore,"they said it was lost in the mail, sent us a refund but not to cover mailing costs. i gave it a 3 because i remember how good it was when i was growing up. do yourself a favor and buy it, but buy it only if you can get it from Amazon directly or can ensure that the dealer will put insurance and tracking on it before you buy. sad, because i really wanted my daughter to have this."
4,Contico Silver wolf gun transport carrier,"Good case, does not look like a gun case which is good. Nicely made, has plenty of locking lugs and the wheels work great. I wish one was made that was taller so you could carry two rifles with optics on them. Right now, only one scoped gun will fit. (ar15 style gun)"
4,Contico two gun transport carrier,"I had looked at this case through my other distributors and seemed to miss it. I have another case by the same company and really liked the latch security. The price was very goood, as well."
2,"Goopy, impractical for large projects.","Thick and goopy, doesn't mix/blend well, doesn't spread well over paper. Not recommended for large projects; might work better for smaller pieces."
4,Great Theme,"It's a good game one of my favorites, but it's easier than most of the nancy drew's, so if you're a beginner in these games I would recommend it. If you are an experienced and addicted player (like me) I would recommend a newer version of nancy drew, those tend to be more challenging."
1,no work,"this program is notcommonly downloadedand could harm yourcomputerpor favor , no instale el producto,nesecito mi credito en mi cta."
4,"Good Game, Misleading Description","When I ordered this game, I expected it to be Danger on Deception Island alone, but it was a triple pack with two other games I've never heard of before. And while it might seem like a good deal to get two extra games, I still think that it was a bit inappropriate that the seller failed to define the exact product the customer will be receiving."
2,Charged,"I was charged for it twice, and it only was downloaded once. Good game and it worked well, but I was charged 6.99 twice."
3,older Nancy Drew game,"Because it's an older game it's not full screen. The graphics are not as good as the newer games and it's not as hard as the newer games. This would be the perfect ""new to Nancy Drew"" game players game to purchase. I wish I had played this one first so all the others would of been a pleasant surprise."
4,AWESOME first time around.,"This is a very cool game. I was so happy to find something for my age group--it says the minimum age is 10, but I think some 10 year olds may find it to be too hard. The design is very mature--adults can play too! The graphics are pretty realistic, and the sound is good too. I found myself learning stuff along the way, like morse code and whale facts. The only cons I could find were that the game freezes often, and you have to wait for it to unfreeze again. Also, it's not as good the second time around if you play it again immediately. So I would wait a few weeks before starting again. But I did get my money's worth out of this adventure."
4,Very fun!,Love this game! this Nancy Drew game will give you lots of fun and adventure! I had this game on CD and lost it and was very happy when i found it on amazon game downloads. The only draw back is its a little slow sometimes and drags in parts of the game.In this game as Nancy Drew you are going to visit George's friend who runs a whale watching tour boat and you stumble upon a mystery! Its up to you as Nancy Drew to solve the mystery! Happy Mystery solving!
2,Game? What Game?,"I'm really surprised at the good reviews this game got, because this game is mediocre, at best! I had played this game before, but it had been a few years and sometimes I like things better the second time I play them - but this particular Nancy Drew wasn't worth my time or my money. I feel like the programmers had a great story and the first half of the game was okay, but then it just ended, like they were on a deadline so they just slapped the last part together. The characters were not likeable, the puzzles WAY too easy even on Senior detective. If you're a Nancy Drew PC game lover, like me, and you have to play it just to say you've played them all then go ahead - but be warned: you'll be disappointed."
3,Not the Best,"I've played all of the Nancy Drew Games (except the Final Scene) and this one was pretty good. It was well-written, but I didn't think it was as interesting as some of the other games. I would reccomend the Haunted Carousel or Treasure in the Royal Tower instead."
2,Not likeing the fustration!!!!!!!!,"I have worked and worked and gone over and over all the hints, helps, and made cotact with all the characters and I am stuck in the Light House. The telephone call/hints tell me the Light House has some oil for the morse code light, but I have looked all over the Light House and can't find any oil. And the hits have become very vague. I can't find help anywhere. I advise everybody NOT TO BUY THIS GAME. It starts out O.K. but then it show some malfunctioning bugs. Perhaps that is why it is selling for $2.99. Too bad. I like Nancy Drew. For me her games are now suspect with bugs. I will not buy another Nancy Drew game. Too bad, so sad. O well, moving on..............Viviana"
5,Nancy's got a winner here!,"I buy these Nancy Drew games, send one to my 12 year old niece in Canada, have another one at home in Florida for my 9 year old daughter and then my niece and her mom vs. myself and my daughter have long distance competitions to see who can solve the mystery first.We were disappointed with Haunted Carousel. But Danger on Deception Island made up for it. Great puzzels, fun reactions from Nancy when we tried to feed her wierd sandwiches, challenging problems to solve and it was long enough to satisfy the girls and moms. The whale was cool and the dangers when Nancy slips or trips or gets caught were fun and exciting.This one's a keeper and we give it 4 thumbs up!"
5,This is my favorite one!!!,"I have only played 5 of the Nancy Drew games. I can say this is my favorite one yet! It starts out that Katie Firestone's boat was vandalized. Several suspects such as Holt Scotto, Jenna Deblin, And Andy Jason. At first I thought it was Katie Firestone. Very cool game and I just can't wait for Nancy Drew and the Secret of Shadow Ranch!!!!!!!!!"
4,Danger on Deception Island,"I am a huge Nancy Drew fan, so I ordered this game before it came out. Although taking a vacation to visit a tourguide doesn't sound as fun as finding buried treasure or solving the mystery of a carousel that starts by itself, i was surprised. This game, unlike the other 8, has an outdoors feeling. You can travel more places, making parts of this game harder than the other ones. The graphics are terrific and so is the plot. I would reccommend this to anyone and everyone."
5,Danger on Deception Island,"In the beginning, it started kind of slow but as the story went along, it got more and more interesting. I thought the ending was really terrificI look forward to her new video"
5,Nancy Drew Deception Island,I'm a Grandma to 6 and we do the Nancy Drew games together. Most of the time the kids are better then me at them. So far I have them all and this is one of the better ones we've played. I play it alone too. It's a game for all ages!
4,Better than others,"I got these for my daughter who has tubes in her ears. We mainly use them for swimming in pools/lakes. They work pretty well. They stay in for the most part, but can come out pretty easily with just a little bit of the toddler picking. It does sometimes get stuck in her hair, which makes for a bit of an uncomfortable mess but not too bad. Overall better than the drug store kind, but still not perfect."
1,Falls out and doesnt seal,"You cant put this into the ear canal without fear of it getting stuck, and you cant place it on the outter canal without it falling out."
5,They work!,"Can't go wrong-they stay put and keep water out! My son does great with them after having tubes he must wear them in the bath or shower, and has at water parks and the lake."
1,Sticky mess,I know these have a lot of good comments which is why I gave them a shot but they are so sticky when you are not in water and I had to keep pulling stands of my hair out of them. Not a good option if you have long hair.
5,Good value and work great!,"We used these recently on a beach trip and had no problems. I was able to make two pairs of ear plugs for my one-year old out of one plug alone. At this rate, it seems like we'll get about 12 pairs from a 3-pair pack. The plugs feel a little like play-doh and are really easy to use - you just divide them until you get the right size for your ear, then place them on the inside of the ear and gently press them in place. We did this and didn't they didn't fall out and my baby was very comfortable with them. After a swim, I just pinched them and pulled them out with no problems. I didn't have any issues with them breaking apart or leaving bits in the ear - they came out clean in one piece. Best of all they worked! No water int the ears!"
3,"Work well, but better product for the pirce out there",These worked well and did the job nicely and I appreciated the little case that they came with but for the price there are other comparable products out there.
3,Really Out There,"Okay, here's what I garnered from this book. Bottom line: we all come from a galaxy far, far away. The author arrives at this assumption from her extensive knowledge of ancient legends and cultures. She also backs up her theories with her experience as an astronomer. However, neither of these lends credence to what really just amounts to as her opinion. Neither does her 'visions' and intuitive insights into the origin of humans constitute any proof. Sorry, but I just need more.I'm in a sort of quagmire over how I feel about this book. On the one hand, I found it interesting and informative in regards to the history of the ancient cultures the author discusses. On the other hand, I was so bored, I was barely able to get through it. Looks like starwalking isn't for me--the book or the pursuit."
5,Wonderful music,"Refreshing new sound from a beautiful voice. Loved the production of Carol of the Bells. The mix is new and upbeat. Makes you just want to dance with the beat. Cali's voice is very clear, you can understand her every word. Such a nice change from most of the young singers today. Cannot wait to her more from this new artist."
4,A Book that Bimota Lovers Should Have,"Reviews are so difficult to really get your head around because they are subject to the writers personal relative perspective and experience on the subject matter.This book definitely ""IS "" a wonderful book to have in one's library and an absolute joy to be able to look at the fantastic and very successful motorcycles that this company has produced through the years.The only reason that I have not given it a 5 star rating, is because the facts presented in this book are not 100% correct. Unfortunately, people who do read books of this nature get led into thinking that ""this is the bible of Bimota"".Other than that, it is great, filled with lots of interesting stuff......go and buy it. You will love it."
4,An enjoyable read for child and adult!,"The bright rhymes and whimsy make this, and all the Toad books, fun reading for little children and grown-ups alike. I took it to my book club and we really laughed at some of the applications to our own lives. As Toad aptly puts it, ""We love to eat. We never say no. Anywhere, anytime we're ready to go."""
3,long song,"I am familiar with the product but this supplier needs to find a new business, a week after order and it has not shipped yet. The need to hire more help for find a new line of work. Product is great, supplier is awful!!! Buy elsewhere."
2,great movie - terrible blu-ray transfer,"I purchased a copy of the blu-ray version of M*A*S*H as it is one of my favorite films. My old DVD copy has better definition than the new blu-ray edition. Reading the reviews, I can not understand how this blu-ray edition is reaping such praise for the video quality. The copy I have is so grainy that it looks like it was stolen from a 42nd street grindhouse after sitting on the shelf for 20 years. The colors are washed out; no contrast to speak of. What gives? What a horrible waste for such a great film!"
4,I like it,"So the Rolling Stones are still imitating the Beatles. This book is set up just like THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY book, and is even published by the same publisher. But it's not as good, because the Stones aren't the Beatles. But also it does not go into as much depth--nor with new ""discoveries""--as the ANTHOLOGY book. Plus it's much shorter, even though their career is decades longer. (It also isn't a #1 bestseller like ANTHOLOGY). I wish ACCORDING TO...had dug deeper. But I'd rather have it than not, and it does include some wonderful stories and facts and photos. Any die hard Rolling Stones fan certainly shouldn't do without it."
3,Fine book..........but the Wyman book is much better!,"This is more like a bound volume of personal interviews with theband. To me, the Bill Wyman book ""Rolling With The Stones"" is still unsurpassed as a complete work."
5,Amazing! Great read and great pics!,"I honestly doubt that a few of the reviewers in here actually read this book. They may have skimmed it, but from what they've written (eg: no hint at Keith's drug problems??---GET OUT!)it's pretty easy to see that they most certainly did not read the book on any serious level. This book is amazing! When I read it I felt like I was actually talking to the Stones and that they were sharing many interesting and informative details about their lives and the lives of those who influenced them musically and otherwise. If you're a Stones fan or very interested in the history of R&R as it applies where this band is concerned, this book is a MUST!"
5,Very necessary book,"Others here have pointed out many things regarding this book, so I don't have to rehash them. But I did want to say I gained a great deal of very necessary help in my own magickal work because of it. From new views of Kabbalah to working with the Paths and the Sephira, to new views on meditation based on St. Ignatius's work. This book is a must in every serious Magician's library. I consult it often and am working from it at the same time. I compliment the writer for having written such a genuinely helpful book."
4,On the right track,"As a person with first hand knowledge of application support and maintenance, I have found the SMART methodology to be well laid out, logical and indeed a definitive outline of best practices. The forms and reports mentioned in the book are available directly from Resource Information Systems and plans are in the works for them to publish an addendum which will contain this additional valuable information. Contrary to the other reviewer I did not find this publication to be sales oriented nor specifically aimed as selling RIS services, the real life examples cited in the book are based on RIS experience which describes their development and implementation of the methodology at numerous client sites."
5,Dog With A Bone - Great,I saw these guys live and bought their CD. I never get tired of listening to this. Lots of original catchy tunes with a cowboy twist to many that a lot of fun. Good listening for anyone.
3,This book does not exist.,"Hi. As the author of the material, I'd like to point out that this edition of the material was never published by Marvel Comics. You can find this material in digest format by running a search for 0785117555 in the Amazon.com search function above."
5,Sneaky gift for the groom,"Girls, great way to give the guy of the hour ideas for ways to please you! Like cutting out gifts from a catalog and leaving them in the sports page, this book will help your hubby to be make YOU a happy wife to be! Highly recommended..."
1,UNLIKABLE CHARACTERS,"I didn't like any of the characters in this movie. Shawn Hatsoy plays the main character (David) who is a ginger loser. He is awkward around girls and is obsessed with Jenny, a free spirit (borderline slut) who sees him as a friend and apparently the only girl who will give him the time of day in all of the college kingdom. He tries to win her over by writing poetry, which isn't half bad until he reads it aloud. She meets David's friend Alan (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who asks her out and poses nude for her (the only nudity in this movie is sausage) which leads to a sexual encounter. They become lovers and David feels rejected and hurt. Alan is the third psycho in this group as he pledges his love for Jenny while he bangs a blonde. None of the characters were nice people and could all be described as losers. I was most sad that they didn't all die. Yes, Rachel Leigh Cook runs around in a pair of cute panties in the beginning and that is as good as the movie gets."
4,I was surprised after people panned it,"I thought... what the heck, I'll watch it. So I did. I loved it. I was SO surprised none of the critics liked it. It was well made and the characters are all rather believable. I was surprised at how many bad reviews it got. I thought it was rather good."
5,TANGLED,"A must see for all Jonathan Rhys Meyers fans wanting to see a little more....of his acting in the beginning of his career.""He is young and ambitious and needs to have it all no matter what it cost him or who he hurts"" He's the guy your mother warned you about."
1,Tangled gets tangled in its own self......a big bore,"Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake)."
2,WARNING!!! This is not the sludgy-doom rock band Crowbar.,"This is a funky-countryish-hippie band from 1972. With no song listing, inaccurate release date, and no reviews, it was easy to mistake this for the new Crowbar. If you like the old schoolhouse rock type of music you may like this. It is so depressing to get uplifting happy music when I wanted depressing doom music. *sigh*"
3,Darxtar - 'Tombola' (Record Heaven) 3 1/2 stars,"Not counting cassette releases or various artist discs where they have one track, 'Tombola' is the Scandinavian progressive space rock band's fifth CD. From what I understand, 'Tombola' is the group's most comprehensive record to date and it was recorded over the course of two years, plus it took about that much longer to locate a label that was willing to released it. Total of thirteen cuts and a duration of 69:09. Tracks that I thought made the grade were ""Blue Frozen Flame"", the rocking ""Compromised Space"", ""In The Spiral"" and the eight-minute title cut ""Tombola"". Line-up: K. Soren Bengtsson - guitar & vocals, Fredrik Sundqvist - violin, Marcus Pehrsson - bass & vocals, Soren Mertensson - synth&organ and Patric Danielsson - drums. Also check out my review of their self-titled debut. Without a doubt, should draw in fans of early Floyd, Hawkwind, Clearlight, Escapade and Gong."
5,A Powerful Policy Critique,"It is rare to find a bold, independent analysis of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Leon Hardar's ""Sandstorm"" presents a clear picture that U.S. policy follows an obsolete Cold War paradigm that incurs huge costs. It is heading for a ""destructive disengagement."" His remedy: less U.S. intervention, more European involvement, and a re-orientation of Israel's foreign policy. Hardar knows the complex history of the Middle East, and that gives his book much authority."
3,A fantastic journey through culture,"I read the original book before any of these other publishers butchered it.I acknowledge that this guy was not everything he claimed to be, but his story is a fantastic insight into native american life.I have seen much critism of him, but he was very passionate about native american culture and was indeed very much envolved with many groups.He is just one of the many authors that have been ""rubbed out"", it seems anyone that if anyone even suggests that american history was anything other then beautiful and justified they have their credibility assaulted, in life and in death.If someone went to such troubles in silencing him (another mysterious death) then you can bet he had something worth saying.If anyone has his original book please contact me :...... as I wish to make it widely avaliable."
5,Cycle of Victorious Living Book (Used),"Although the book was used, it appeared to be brand new. No folded or dog eared pages or writing inside. No owners name, etc. Excellent delivery and product. Will buy again at this site in the future."
5,Successful gift,"This is a great book for Bruce Lee fans or fans of deep philosophical thought. I skimmed it before giving it and was very pleased. Its just things Bruce Lee had said about life. Not all I agree with but hey, it was still pretty cool to see what a famous martial artist and man who broke through some heavy racism (on both sides) had to say about life."
2,Just like a fortune cookie,"Somewhat confusing, and very much like a fortune cookie. Would have been better if it came wrapped in a giant cookie. Would reccommend passing on this even if you like Bruce Lee."
2,Not Bruce Lee,"I enjoyed this book at first, but after reading James Bishop's book ""Dynamic Becoming"" he showed that most of the stuff published in ""Striking Thoughts"" comes from other authors. It is still good info, but clearly this is not Bruce Lee's words."
1,Boring and cluttered with no structure,"I bought this book because I respect Bruce Lee as a person and was interested in his thoughts on life. What I got was page after page of cluttered philosophical quotes. And that was it. I expected some stories of Bruce Lee's past that taught him important lessons but after reading page after page of no-stop small snippets, I could not remember a thing after a few pages. You read 1 page then get to the next page and forget the previous page. I can only recommend this book for someone who is simply looking for a philosophical quote for a piece of work or project."
1,1hour and 27min of my life ill never get back,"This movie had all the appeal of watching my dog pinch a loaf on my lawn, actually that is more entertaining. The high point in the film was the actual construction of the robot, everything before and after was a total waste of money and time. What were Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett getting paid to do other than taking showers and rolling around naked with each other? Surely they were there for a reason but what, they never did any work at all and as far as the special effects I've seen better shadow puppets for an eclipse than the one in this film. Harvey Keitel was a very convincing horn ball that's about it; I think his mission was to get laid by Farrah. The absolute worst was Hector falling into the acid and coming out with what looked like dried Crisco stalactites shouldn't all of his plastic tubing have instantly melted? Anyway I think I'll go watch Cabin Boy now since it now looks like Casablanca compared to this."
1,Worse Than Jabba's Restroom Biscuits,"The 1970's saw a degradation of the sci-fi medium, with notable stinkers such as ""Silent Running"" (tree hugging hippies in outer space), ""Logan's Run"" (youth drug culture at its worst) and this canon fodder which merged the absurd with the contemptible. The plot, or more-so, the arrangment of Kirk Douglas in a ridiculous role, takes place on Sheba, a moon of Saturn where there is a really old horny guy (Douglas), over the top as ever and his young sex slave (Facett), who does numerous nude scenes. This is so painful to watch because there is absolutely no chemistry between the two. Add a lousy Kietal in the ""mad scientist"" role and this goes even further into the stink pit. The special effects are lousy as is the dialogue. Not for the intelligent."
1,format stinks!!,This movie has european formats so you have to change settings on your DVD player to view it. Skip it!!!
2,Another Waste of Good Actors,"Kirk Douglas, Harvey Keitel, and Farrah Fawcett are ""lost in space"" in a horrible film about two astronauts terrorized by a robot with a human personality. Think ""The Brain that Wouldn't Die"" transplanted into one of the Terminator skeletal frames robots and you get the picture.I'll let you figure out which of the two male actors is 1/2 of the romantic couple and which one is the ""mind"" behind the malevolent machine.It gets two stars because Douglas and Fawcett compliment each other."
1,saturn 3,"Couldn't play it on our dvd player in North America, very very disappointed! We needed a different software because it was from Europe, go figure."
2,What A Mess...slow and pedantic,"Firstly I am the a great Farrah fan...and am trying to complete my collection of ALL her work. So that is the only reason for purchasing this drivel. What a dissapointment this is... filmed at the height of the Sci Fi craze; Star Wars, Alien which it resembles at times but without the tension and fear...the story is slow and pedantic. The premise is not bad (two scientists working on a remote planet to save the world's food shortage peaceful existance is shattered by the arrival of a killer and his pyschotic robot) but there is no build up or character development at all. Harvey Keitel and Kirk Douglas are capable actors but one wouldnt say so from this drivel (Keitels voice is dubbed to add insult to injury) and Farrah...well...there is no hint here of the excellent character actress she would later become...but to be fair maybe she was only as good as the material she was given."
2,I am guilty once again,"AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE:If you like campy Science Fiction as I do than this film is for you.There is not a lot to say about film like this because it is not actually any good at all. It is just a ""Cult"" like bad Sci-Fi movie that is enjoyable to those who well, enjoy this type of fun rubbish. And I am guilty.To add a bit, this film stars Farrah Faucet that alone gives it potential. This film brings back memories of my childhood bedroom and that famous poster I blew a kiss to each night before going to bed."
5,Great Blend of Sci-Fi and Horror,"I remember watching this movie about 31 years ago late at night on HBO. It scared me with dark sets and creepy robot. I loved the robot creepy as hell!!! Farrah Fawcett, Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel are great together here. Harvey Keitel in a very early roll very creepy and twisted character. Great Sci-Fi, Horror roller coaster ride.!!!"
3,A good dumb movie,"It's very hard to belive Stanley Donen directed this fun, unusual yarn set in a bizaare space station posessed by a happy anti-human couple (Kirk Douglas & Farrah Fawcett) until visitor, Harvey Keitel (who develops a big liking for Fawcett) sends out a robot to kill them both. Douglas's needless little nude scene was nominated for a Golden Turkey but lost to Linda Blair's nude scene in CHAINED HEAT. The critics really dumped on this one but the average movie goer may find it watchable."
3,A must for Quiet Riot fans,"This DVD is pure, raw, live footage. It is a must own for all Quiet Riot fans. All band members playing their bihinds off. Great tribute to Randy. Must watch TV."
4,Solid Dvd for the fans,"After much waiting and being pushed back several times the Quiet Riot dvd was finally released. Overall any fans of the band will enjoy this DVD along side the live CD included. I would have preferred a few more songs added to the setlist and in the bonus features it would have been nice to have all their videos included and brand new interviews with the band.Any fan of Quiet Riot or just good solid hard rock n roll will enjoy this Dvd. Like him or hate him Kevin has an unquie voice and the rest, Rudy, Carlos and Frankie are as always top notch muscians who clearly enjoy what there doing.Very sad they decided to break up right before this dvd was released, however this will give the fans something to watch for years to come."
5,a book,received in a timely manor and it was just what I expected it to be sorry so long for this review
5,Easy,This is a great and simple book to find answers to some situations you may be facing :) I recommend this to anyone.
5,Nancy Wilson is the ultimate DIVA!,"When I heard Nancy Wilson sing ""Hello, like Before"", I immediately fell in love with her all over again. It has been many years since I took the time to listen to Nancy, but I knew I had to have that CD. I'm enjoying it right now as I write this review. I recommend it highly!"
1,complete waster of money,"plug it in, get power, turn it on high, rollers start rolling. put dogs on rollers, (oh, be sure to use the short dogs, otherwise you will only fit 4, not 8)....And then,...WHERES THE HEAT.... 15 minutes? BUNK. Had them on for over an hour, and NOTHING.....Went through the manual, everything was done correctly. WASTE OF MONEY. Thought this would be cute for camping. It's going back!!"
4,sweet story/a+ on the illustrations,"this story is too cute for words! and the illustrations--oooooh,i am melting.sooo cute!--i love it.the gist of the tale is this:it is circa late 19th century,jane elizabeth wantsa puppy SO bad,she can think of nothing else. so,does jane elizabeth get herpuppy? read it and see.gushing aside,i am intrigued by the artwork by carroll dolezal. it looks like asepia color on a white background-watercolors(?)with the other parts of the drawing being black ink. the effect is very striking. i love it. part of the reason iread children's books,is the artwork. this artwork truly makes this story special."
5,link an advanced boy to a cube,this is great way to play if you like game boy advance controls better than the controls on a gamecube controller
4,"Excellent points, but it's all been said before","This book has some very useful info in it, but I've seen it all before. I read this one right after reading O'Reilly's Information Architecture and felt, at times, that I was reading the same book. The case studies of different sites (news, e-commerce, etc.) were very nice though. Most design/navigation books out there only focus on the kind of site that the author works on. That's not very helpful if the author works for a University and you work for a news organization. This book covered that. I would still recommened ""Information Architecture"" over this one, but it is still worth reading through."
4,"Really two books in one, excellent resource link list on CD","I guess I knew what I was getting with this book. The first half is what I really wanted - the author's perspective on design, architecture, and navigation. I know that the case studies in the second half of the book need to be general enough to pertain to the first half of the book. And I think the author does that just fine. I actually find the compilation of resources, in the back of her book, and on the CD to be top-notch. I've used most of these sites as educational resources since there are few formal ways of learning interface design (and similar) without attending multiple conferences (expensive) or going to some university program (two years if you can get in and pay the high price of tuition). I do think that the author's book, in combination with, for example, Rosenfeld's book, Lynch & Horton's book, and others, makes for a pretty reasonable library. You have to start somewhere."
3,"well, it's ok, and ...","It's worth reading it, but you will probably think all the time ""yes I know that, and?"". If this is your first book about web usability it will help you but if you wish to be enlighten think twice. I'm a graphic designer working on this field since 1996 and no example or analysis in this book surprised me at all; in fact it reaches more or less the same conclusions that anyone who visits those websites will find."
5,Web designers need this book!,"I wish I could buy this book in bulk and send it out to the webmasters of half the sites that are online. Sheesh. IMHO, designers just aren't thinking about how the user approaches navigation *nearly* as often as they should be ... and don't even get me started about how rarely marketers and programmers take usability into consideration (or so it seems to me).It's true that this book is just the tip of the iceberg on the navigation issue, but it's a great start. As web designers (hopefully) take some of these navigational principles to heart, I hope the author expands on these ideas in future editions."
5,Pleased the Recipient,This was a gift; I never saw it as I had it direct shipped to Mom but she was very pleased.
3,pearl studs,"The color of the pearls was a bit more purple-ish than pictured, but a very nice set nevertheless."
3,Akoya Black Pearl: correction,"None of the Akoya Pearls come in a natural black colour. All Akoya Pearls are white pearls. The Akoya pearls that are offered in black colour are treated pearls, either died black or sccientifically treated black in silver nitrate. It therefore should mention 'Akoya black treated pearls' or 'Akoya died black pearls'Rudi Zingg"
4,PERLAS HERMOSAS,"It is a beautiful pearl very regular and with good luster, is a bit small, but well mounted and for people allergic like me, is excellent in the saddle gold 14 K. I'm happy with my purchase. Only thing that is very bad if it is for gift presentation, comes in a small plastic bag and a bag of cloth then, the pledge could put a box more suitable to their quality"
4,Good Remix,"For those that they like the Latin voice in English with Caribbean touches, to Ricky Martin's style, he will like Eduardo Xol, the so much remix of Don't leave me here alone or "" CORAZON"" in Spanish and I'll be there for you is of great quality. The first time that listens both simple ones in some friends' house, I decided to acquire them and I find the price exactly.-------Para aquellos que les guste la voz latina en ingles con toques caribeños, al estilo de Ricky Martin, le gustará Eduardo Xol, los remix tanto de Don't leave me here alone o ""CORAZON"" en español y I'll be there for you son de gran calidad. La primera vez que escuche ambos sencillos en casa de unos amigos, decidí adquirirlos y el precio me parece justo"
4,About The Animus Diaries,"There is one word to describe Keplyn,..... PoeticListening to this album is like going out to the park and enjoying the subtlety of nature. What really makes his album stand out, is his incorporation of music elements from African drum beats to new age jazz harmonies. In some of his songs, Keplyn does more reciting in a whispering, soft-spoken manner than singing, which is very unique. This CD may not be ""HOT"" for some, but it's something that is worth enjoying out of the ordinary."
1,Visions of Sugar Plums,This book was terrible - not up to the standards of Janet Evanovich - I think she fell into that same thing that a lot of authors fall into - you basically get too popular and then you turn out [garbage]! - I won't buy her next one!
3,Not quite good enough,"Ok it is Christmas and it's fun to read about a favorite sleuth. This is not quite up to Evanovich's usual humorous style.Only on good laugh in this one, can't wait for the next full length one."
3,Eh.,"Anything that mentions Joe Morelli gets 3 or more stars by my standards but this was Harry Potter meets Stephanie Plum. A little too weird and PLEASE call it a novella, not a novel!"
1,Not up to par with the other Plum books,"This book was such a disappointment. I love the Stephanie Plum books, but Evanovich missed the mark on this one. A bunch of guys with magical powers? Really? It was like the author tried to pound out a quick story between writing other things. Glad I borrowed it from the library, because it's not worth paying for."
3,Visions of Sugar Plums,"I love Stephanie Plum and have read all of Janet Evandvich's books, but for some reason I just did not enjoy this book Maybe because I felt it was a little silly. I will still buy Janet Evandvich's books Donna"
4,Visions of sugar plums,I love these stories. They make me laugh every time. A little redundant as the stories progress but still entertaining.
5,Another Stephanie Plum - winner!,"I love Janet Evanovich! Funny, quirky, and believable characters. This book is no exception. Stephanie Plum's life is so funny, but believable. I like romantic comdey and humorous mysteries; this is both."
1,A Merry Christmas way to make extra money,I thought that this book was a great way for Janet Evanovich to take advantage of her fans and make some extra Christmas money. This just wasn't the quality I've come to expect for a Stephanie Plum novel. I too would rate it a zero if that rating were there.
1,Did Evanovich really write this?,"The character's names are the same, the writing is different. The writing is stilted, forced. The characters are flat. The story is stupid. It lacks the maturity and flow of the numbered books. It reads like it is written by a completely different author, someone who is trying too hard. Perhaps a college student. This book is a complete disappointment. I kept hoping Stephanie would wake up at the end and realize it was all a bad dream because that is what this book is."
1,I was disappointed,I love the Stephanie Plum books but I didn't like this one enough to finish it. I'll stick to the number books and pass on the specials from now on. I didn't like the Thanksgiving one either.
2,Don't waste your money...,"What a disappointment! I am a big fan of this series, but I think Evanovich is just capitalizing on the popularity of the series and wrote this very short, very stupid story for the money. And enough with the burned up cars already, it is getting old!"
2,Visions of Sugar Bums,"I love Janet, but this was a real disappointment. It took me less than two hours to read this book...just about as long as it probably took Janet to write it. Were we trying to make some kind of production quota here? I can't even say it was a piece of ""fun fluff."" It was nothing. Janet, less cheese doodles and more ""meat."""
1,Not What I expected.,"Thank goodness, I had read all of the eight books Evanovich had written prior to Visions of Sugar Plums. Based on my feeling after reading this book I would have no inclination to read any thing else written by her.I didn't think the book was funny or enjoyable reading.There is a waiting list at our local library for this book,I think those waiting, will be as disappointed as was I after reading the book.I hope in her next book she stays with her former style of writing and characters."
3,Cute,"Okay, so it's not great literature. Anyone who enjoys the Stephanie Plum series knows that. But this little holiday offering has everything that we've come to expect in Stephanie's adventures -- a great looking man or two, Grandma and Lula in full force, and another auto mishap.If you want a good mystery with suspense or if you want good writing, stay away. But if you want another couple of hours with an old friend and her crazy family, you'll get it here."
3,A disppointing read,My review of this book is brief. . . terminally cute. I expect more from Evanovich. It's too bad she couldn't think of a way to get Deisel into Stephanies life that didn't involve the supernatural.
2,"Funny Book ,But Don't Buy IT, Borrow It","Visions of Sugar Plums takes place a few days before Christmas. Stephie Plum hasn't bought presents, sent Christmas cards or put up a tree. She's determine to find Sandy Claws , who skipped a court appearnace.Someone could still enjoy the story even if they hadn't read the other novels.Stephanie's family play a major role in the story and Joe Morrelli , Stephanie's boyfriend makes brief appearnces.It is a fun story to read before Christmas and it is short. Some funny scences include Stephanie being attacked by elves , Grandma Mazur's missing fake teeth, etc. There is a supernatural element to the story which is never completly explained , but it doesn't matter. Everthing comes together at the end. I meant to give it 3 stars not two."
1,Too much time touring,"I love the Plume series #1-6. #7 and 8 were repeditive, but this one was too much! Should stay away from Super Natural-leave that to Stephen King. Will give one last chance but can wait for #9 in paperback."
1,what a waste of money and time,"This isn't a book; it's a double spaced long short story. It has no plot. It's just a string of events that the author tells us is charming. She must be chuckling to herself all the way to the bank that she convinced an editor that this is a book and convinced a publisher to print and distribute it. I can write a more entertaining story on a day when I have the flu! Don't waste your money buying it and don't waste your time reading it. Not only does it not deserve any stars, I want to take away stars from any books which happen to be unlucky enough to be in the vicinity!"
2,Disappointing,"Normally, I absolutely adore Stephanie Plum, but this book was not worth reading. They're always more about the interaction then the mystery, but ordinarily the mystery makes some kind of sense. ""Visions of Sugar Plums"" didn't really have a plot. Its two stars were salvaged by classic Steph moments, like the bathroom incident (You'll know what I mean when I get to it.) Skip to ""To the Nines."""
4,"Funny fantasy--lighten up, folks!","This is a funny fantasy, a good Christmas offering with a tongue-in-cheek style that's breezy and fun. After reading the other reviews, I got a copy from the library, unwilling to shell out big bucks for such a short book I might not like, but found it to be right up there with other Evanovich offerings. It's obviously meant to be a fantasy, a confection of unlikely events worthy of Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, and all our other holiday creations. While there's no sexy Ranger, it's got all the other elements Plum-fantatics enjoy. Lighten up, folks. This is meant to be fun and it succeeds."
5,Funny funny funny,I love her books! They make me laugh outloud and the antics of Stephanie Plum are just so outrageous you can't help but feel good after reading about her exploits. I would reccommend this book to anyone who needed a good belly laugh.
2,Don't base your opinion of the Plum series on this one.,"This book is not anywhere near as bad as the Full House series, but doesn't do justice to the usual Stephanie Plum novel. I absolutely love the Plum series, but this one was ridiculous. It takes a big break from reality, it's missing some major characters, and it's not just as much fun."
3,Hmmm,"Good, all though somewhat off beat. Had the standard Plum characters, etc, but I thought the departure from reality was bizarre, at best. Still funny, but I don't know if it was worth what I paid."
4,Quaint and Cozy Christmas Chronicle,"Think of this ""Stephanie Plum Holiday Novel"" as a quaintly quirky snack mix. It's a Janet Evanovich, Stephen King, and Frank Capra -esque kind of Wonderful Life. It's a cleverly contrived cozy Christmas chronicle that even incorporates a spin on Sir Clement Moore's classic. And unlike other Christmas confections, there are no calories. Cheers!Reviewed by TundraVision"
2,ok--not great,"I borrowed this book from the library, and I was so glad I hadn't bought it. It was fun, but deffinately not worth [it]. For less than 150 pages, you can get a much better book."
3,"Better read, than heard.","The audio version of this book failed to deliver the ol' Janet Evanovich punch!! Primarily due to the poor read by Lorelei King. Ms King ruined the last two Stephanie novels due to her inability to appropriately portray the characters based on the authors description. I doubt that Stephanie grew up in an upscale Connecticut neighborhood. No expected New Jersey accent, a very poor interpretation of Grandma Mazur, and a terrible read of Ranger and Lula! Bring back Debbie Mazur or Laurie Petty. They got me hooked on Stephanie starting with One for the Money. I found the last three, including Visions of Sugar Plums, extremly dissapointing."
1,I wanted to enjoy it... really I did!,"I was incredibly disappointed in this book. I was looking for something to get me into the Christmas spirit and this just wasn't it. First of all, the sexual innuendo stuff was WAY over the top. While that's usually a somewhat humorous aspect of the Plum series, it had no place here and was glaringly gratuitous. And as for the rest of it... it was just too corny to be enjoyable. I listened to the whole thing because I so desperately wanted it to get better! I've become a big fan of the Plum books over the past year and I'm really glad that this wasn't the first one I purchased. I never would have bought another."
4,Good addition to the Plum series,"I am an avid Stephanie Plum series fan, so when I saw the 2 ""between the number"" books, I bought them right away. I thoroughly enjoyed Visions of Sugar Plums. The new male hero, Diesel, is another studly character in the vein of Ranger/Joe and the story is fun Christmas fare. I highly recommend it for Plum fans."
3,Not actually part of the Stephanie Plum series,"This book was an okay read as I anxously awaited No. 12 of the Plum series. It seemed silly at times, but Evanovich is a terrific writer and so the book kept me engaged enough to read the book through to the end. And it was a quick read. I recommend buying it second-hand -- not worth full price."
2,At Least the Title was Appropriate,"I was SO disappointed with this novella. I found it to have loose ends (...I found it to be somewhat boring....the whole Claws story line didn't make sense, and I felt that Ms. Evanovich couldn't develope the story line in her mind, thus, she wrote willy nilly and figured that people would purchase the book because it was written by her.I found myself reading the unbearable book, just trying to get done. I've lent the book to a few massive fans, just like myself, and no one was happy with the book. I can only recall two laughs, Grandma's teeth, and Valerie's doughy comments, those were the only one's. ..."
3,Thank goodness this wasn't the 9th book!,"I know, I know, this was a novella pumped out for some holiday time entertainment, so don't be too critical. It just wasn't laugh out loud funny like the others. Obviously rushed!! But still love and admire Janet and her ""Joisey"" girl Stephanie Plum! I would suggest reading if you are an avid fan just to keep up with Plum gang, but if you are a first timer, just go for the 1-8 books, they are most definitely worth it!"
3,Left me wanting more....,"Evanovich had a good idea with this Stephanie Plum Christmas book, but I wish she had taken the time to flesh out the story a bit more--I wanted more detail! But the story has the usual hilarious and zany Evanovich characters and events. A good effort!"
2,Glad I checked it out of the library!,"This book exhibits all of the weaknesses I feel are in books Six, Seven and Eight of the Stephanie Plum series. I actually didn't finish Eight, and nearly put this book down too. But since it was so short, I kept slogging. Character development is going nowhere, plot/mystery is thin to non-exisistent - I feel the stories are getting by on humor, and that's it. While funny, the book ultimately doesn't deliver what I read books to experience. I think Janet is falling prey to the curse of authors that are successful in the marketplace - knock out a book a year, regardless of its quality, or if you actually have a story tell. (See Anne Rice.) I'll wait longer for a good story."
3,A Decent Short Story,"This was a decent short story. If it had been sold with 3 or 4 others, it would have been worth the money."
3,Bah! Hum Bug!,"I first want to say that I'm a big Evanovich fan. I couldn't wait for the release of this book and I had it pre-ordered from the first day it was available ... I am so disappointed. Like most everyone else I feel the book was over priced for a book under 150 pages. I was expecting a ""complete"" novel. I was hoping for a story the caliber of Evanovich's previous novels. It almost seems that Evanovich took her previous Stephanie Plum stories and changed the name of characters just enough to a give the book a Christmas theme.Most of all I didn't get my ""Morreli"" fix and Ranger was not in this story. I think Diesel was Stephanie's fantasy of Ranger ... in disguised, as a super hero.If you are an Evanovich fan ... I would read the book. I would not recommend this book to a new reader."
3,Not Quite Full Circle,"As an avid Evanovich reader (I've read all the Plumsat least once), I have very high expectations for herbooks. Visions of Sugarplums had the great laughs I'vecome to look forward to, but the story line was quite abit weaker than in any of the other Plums. I did not feelthat the story ever came full circle. There seemed to besomething missing. This is a great read to get you in theholiday spirit and it packs a lot of laughs for such a shortbook, but it was only good enough to tide me over untilher next book comes out next summer. I think it could havebeen a much stronger book if the story line had been a littlebetter--I like the elements of magic in the story--its justtoo abrupt. Definitely worth reading, but not quite enough forsatisfying my craving."
4,Liked it better the second time,"This is laugh-out loud funny in many places. I guess ""zany"" would be the best word to describe it. Rather like the old Lucy-Ethel shows. I liked it better upon the second reading. When I read it when it first came out, I didn't think much of it, but I liked it better this time. Maybe because it is better than the last few Stephanie novels. I had my hopes for the movies, but I can't see Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur. I think she'll spoil it."
2,Not worth the money...,"Having never read a book by Evanovich before, perhaps I am judging hastily. My first thought is that perhaps every author shouldn't try to hop onto the ""Christmas book wagon."" - Overall, as a pretty keen mystery reader, I DID find it creative. But I also found it lacking plot, logic and basically a silly read. The only reason that I slogged all the way through it is that I paid full price."
3,Janet Writes Junk,I am a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series but this Christmasbook isn't cutting it. It could be much worse though- read some of Evanovich's early works before the Stephanie Plum series. Evanovich- quantity doesn't mean quality and you set a high standard with your first 8 Plum books so keep it up to keep your fans.
1,Visions of Sugar Plums,"If this book is an example of Ms Evanovich's work, she should be ashamed. This is absolutely the WORST book I have ever read bar none. I regret having spent even one penny on it not to mention full cost.She, her publishers, and agent should be ashamed!!! I am sure this review will not be printed, but, at least, I vented my spleen. I would never read another book by her. Mary Davis"
1,An insult to your intelligence!,"First of all, I usually can't wait for the latest Stephanie Plum books, but this has got to be the worst since ""Full Tilt"". (I kept searching to see who co-authored this book, but it looks like Janet Evanovich gets all the ""credit"".) This one is just dumb. When the ""hero"" is a guy named Diesel, and there's also a Sandy Claws, I should have listened to my inner voice and skipped this one. The saving grace is ol' Lula...she's a gal after my own heart!Advice: Don't waste your money."
5,stephanie plum series,I love reading the stephanie plum series by Janet Evanovich. This was a very good and funny book
2,Visions of stale sugar plums,This book is not worth the money. If you have never read any of the other Stephanie Plum books it would probably be okay. I found it tired/old/boring. Her other books are great!
1,Visions of Sugar Plums,"Sooo disappointed in this book. When I read Hard Eight, and was disappointed, not only in the length--what was it, about 50,000 words?--but the with plot too, I had hoped that maybe Ms. Evanovich had expended her energy on creating a Christmas classic with the zany Plum characters. Not so. I love the Plum series, and buy the hardcovers the day they are released. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who loves humor. Plus, I'd planned on buying this book as Christmas gifts for friends too cheap to shell out for the hardcover. Guess what? I'm saving my money and hope book nine is redeeming. I think Janet needs to quit the publicity tours and get back to writing the characters and the stories we all expect."
1,What was the author thinking?,"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. Don't waste your money! I love the Stephanie Plum ""number"" series - One for the Money, Two for the Dough, etc. However, this book was very disappointing. I kept waiting for Stephaie to wake up from ""the dream"". Not really believing that the author was really wanting us to buy into this ""drop dead gorgeous guy appearing out of nowhere with super powers"" story line. Janet Evanovich you should be ashamed yourself!"
2,No Sugar Plum.,"I felt cheated, a short unbelievable story, not like Janet Evanovich's other Plum books, an Alien who breaks locks, Elves who bad mouth and fight,a man with electric fingers????????? No, No, lets get back to real life."
2,Skip it,"This book seemed hastily thrown together to make it onto the shelves for the holidays. The plot was thin, the characters undeveloped and the premise was simply stupid. I have loved the other Stephanie Plum books and wish that I hadn't read this one. I hope that ""Nine will be noteworthy""."
3,A total afterthought,"I absolutely love Stephanie Plum novels. That I was not even really interested in this novel is somewhat amazing. There's some supernatural biker named Diesel who winds up in Stephanie's kitchen. Big deal. Half of Trenton has been through her apartment at one time or another. She's on the trail of Sandy Claws who jumped bail. Joe may trust Stephanie, but he's a little too cool for someone who wants to marry her when he sees her at all hours with Diesel. This is the book where Valerie discovers herself pregnant and she pretty much vomits or shops throughout the book, with hysteria in between. Either the book is supernatural or isn't. I think some would call this novel schizophrenic. It's too short to really pick up and get interesting. Oh yeah, Stephanie has another car go up in flames. Is that a surprise or what? I think this book fits in before or after To The Nines in the Plum Continuum."
2,A real disappointment,"For all you Stephanie Plum Fans, I wouldn't bother buying this book. In my opinion its a waste of time. Its a collection of short stories and if I recall correctly there is only one about Stephanie Plum, which was a good little story.Other than that, it was a disappointing read. I wouldn't recommend it and if this has been your only exposure to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, don't give up hope! Start reading the normal Stephanie Plum novels they are much more fun!"
4,Not as good as the other Stephanie Plum novels,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Stephanie Plum novels.I LOVE Ranger and Morelli (don't we all wish we had our own?).I didn't like this one as much. I like the real characters. The main characters in this one were so unreal and it took away from the book.I did enjoy it, though.I can't wait for 10 to come out."
1,BOO... this book sucks,"This is a total waste of money, if you are a fan of the series, then save your money. I don't see the point of this book, the plot is totally unreal. I purchased this book because I am a fan, if I would have known it was a fairy-tale, I would have left it at the store."
2,Shockingly bad.,I love the Plum series and have never given any book of the series less than 5 stars...until now. The plot of this book is too incredible to be even remotely believable. The supernatural twist doesn't fit in with the other books in the series. Where are Ranger and Morelli? How can you have a decent Plum book without them? Read this so you are up to date for the 9th book but expect to be disappointed.
1,I expect more from Janet E.,"Now I know Janet's books are fiction, but at least she made you feel like you knew the characters. However this Diesel guy was not believable at all! Janet was rather vague about who he was and from where he came, so there wasn't any character development.The story was too short and too far-fetched. I hope she won't do this to us again because I really like the Stephanie Plum books."
1,Visions of Sugar Plums,"I can't believe Janet wrote this story with a right mind!I love all her other Plum novels, but this was too weird and I regret asking for this book as a Christmas present. Can I really tell the gift giver I didn't like it and not make them feel bad? What a waste of money."
3,Fantasy and Christmas go together like Santa and cookies!,"I understand that a lot of loyal Stephanie Plum readers are taken aback by this novella. It is different--there is a fantasy element central to the story line that doesn't seem to really make sense in Stephanie's world. However, Stephanie is kind of like George Bailey--she has lost the spirit of Christmas, and it's going to take some fantastic intervention to help her back on the holiday bandwagon. Frankly, I thought this book was fun. Grandma Mazur has a new stud muffin, Mom's hitting the bottle, perfect sister has a surprise, a car gets toasted, AND Stephanie is looking for a guy named Sandy Claws. It satisfied my Plum craving and makes me eager to return to the ""real"" world in book 9. If you can't stand fantasy elements, don't read this book. If, however, you can suspend your disbelief and are jonesing for a little holiday wackiness with the Plums, it's a fun, quick read."
3,Is it wise to change genres in mid-character?,"Generally, not, and this unexceptional and slightly muddled story proves that point. I picked it up expected ""detective story"" meets ""Christmas fun"" and, although I kept turning the pages, it was with the depressing sense of urgency simply to knock off the book so that I could return to the hunt for something more along the lines of what I'd expected to find here.Still, the characters are fun and some of the situations are pretty funny. The story, which will wear best for habitués of Plum-world, almost hits and, even in its wide miss, offers some entertainment."
5,A Fun Christmas Gift!,"This one will get you in the mood for Christmas, in a fun and Stephanie Plum way!! I will add this to my list of Christmas gifts along with more meaningful stories like The Christmas Box and The Gravel Drive by Kirk Martin."
1,"boring, a waste of money","This book is a rip off. I have loved the series, but this book is boring, I laughed once, the plot stunk, it is a waste of money. Do not buy this book. Janet Evanowich needs to be more dedicated to her readers and give them a product that is worth the money. Last book was borderline, this book was terrible, so I am done. Good bye Stephanie, I wish you and your family, especially your Dad, a happy holiday season."
1,why was this published?,"I have given up reading the Stephanie Plum mysteries because they are the same every time. Same jokes, same story line, same dumb blonde. I own this book because a friend thought it would be a good read and so she gave it to me (a year ago). I took it out of my ""books to get rid of"" box and read it in about 2 hours. The plot is thin (so thin it is nearly invisible), the writing is sloppy, the jokes are the same (grandma's missing teeth, her ""studmuffins,"" Stephanie's car blows up, etc.), and it really is the bottom of the barrel in this genre. If you want to read a good story with genuine humor and a solid plot, read Elizabeth Peters or Barbara Michaels. Stephanie Plum is overdone, overexposed, and has overstayed her welcome.Kris, a reader who prefers well-written books even when reading just for fun."
2,"Janet, Janet, Janet","I was disappointed in this novella having read the entire series of Plum books. No Ranger, Hardly any Morelli and some guy named Diesel who ""pops in and out"". The story was not believable and the wedding at the end was ridiculous.Janet, Janet Janet-Please keep Stephanie and the characters that surround her more convincing."
3,a light Christmas read,"light, humorous and quick Christmas read. I always enjoy a Janet Evanovich book and to read a Stephanie Plum adventure"
3,Not as fun as the rest of the series,Not my favorite of all the Stephanie Plum novels....It is a bit off course and goes into the supernatural which I do not like at all. It also introduces another love interest in which I did not click with. The basic line of the novels are a great read - this one not so much.
2,Visions of Sugar Plums,"It didn't completely make sense to me, I didn't think the ending was at all satisfying and didn't resolve any of the questions in the story."
3,Reading with Tequila,"This is not your usual Plum novel. I definitely wasn't expecting the type of story I experienced reading Visions of Sugar Plums. I figured the Between-the-Numbers books would be the same as the regular Stephanie Plum books, only shorter. The addition of supernatural elements was completely out of left field.Visions of Sugar Plums introduces Diesel, a man with the uncanny ability to unlock doors by touch alone. It seems as though he also has the ability to teleport. And, of course, he and Stephanie have some budding sexual tension.Visions of Sugar Plums was unusual and I'm not quite sure if I like the direction the book seems to be taking the series in. If read alone, it is a fun and slightly whimsical mystery. As part of the series, Stephanie is still the same bumbling bounty hunter, but the addition of the paranormal is a little bizarre."
4,Visions of Sugar Plums,"The book was typical Evanovich. It was enjoyable from start to finish. The book was difficult to put down. If you're a Janet Evanovich fan, I would certainly recommend this book."
5,A really fun Christmas read,"I read this in June but would have been even more fun in December. It doesn't have as much meat as the Stephanie Plum numbered novels but is totally worth your time. It's light, funny, and a bit mystical/magical. The new character introduced is a nice addition to the Stephanie, Ranger, Morelli triangle. There's less danger and darkness involved for Stephanie and more whimsy and comedy."
2,Highly Imaginative Christmas Tale!,"This Evanovich book is a detour through the holidays that one may take to escape the pressures of the season. The usual characters from the series of mysteries show up for this amusing, if highly unlikely, Christmas tale. Reading this book will feel like ""home"" for Evanovich fans, but do not expect the thrills and chills and depth of story line that readers usually enjoy in Stephanie Plum books. This is a ""twinkle"" of a book, just right for a light weight read."
3,Visions of Sugar Plums,"I thought this book was just OKAY. It was funny and still told the story of the wonderfully quirkly Stephanie, but compared to all of the other books I've read, this one was just luke warm for me."
2,Not the best Stephanie Plum,This has probably been my least favorite Stephanie Plum book. I think it is because it falls a bit too far out of the realm of possibility for me. I love Stephanie Plum because I can picture myself getting into the same situations and for the same reasons she finds herself. But this was a little too unrealistic for my taste.I know... it's fiction... but still.
2,"Well, I didn't hate it.","This doesn't pack the punch of her other Stephanie Plum offerings but hey, it's the holidays and I'm feeling generous. It is short, and like other reviewers stated, there is very little Joe and no Ranger. But if you don't have a lot of time and you need a quick Stephanie fix this isn't bad. It reads more like a magazine short story but I love Stephanie so I guess that makes me Plum crazy."
3,Fantasy in the Burg...,"I recently read all 12 of the Stephanie Plum series in a row and loved them, can't wait for the next one. I realized I had missed the novellas and read Visions of Sugar Plums last night. It isn't as good as the other Plum adventures, and you have to open up your imagination for this one. Think maybe of the Santa Clause movies, where you suspend reality and then you can enjoy the story line. Do that for this book and it is entertaining."
3,Good fun!,"Like all the Stephanie Plum stories, this one will make you laugh! I enjoy fantasy books so this little bit of magic in Jersey adds to my enjoyment of the story. Reading this will become part of the holiday season every year just like ""The Santa Clause""."
2,An eggnog hangover,I love Stephanie Plum and am quite fond of good fantasy. However the two do not mesh well. Who is Sandy Claws? We never do find out. Who is Ring? What is Diesel? Do we care? This plot does not allow a willing suspension of disbelief. Please borrow this book from the library. You will hate yourself in the morning if you pay full price for what is essentially a short story.
1,Picking the petals from Plum,"Visions Of Sugar Plums was a disappointment. With all the supernatural and comic book characters now appearing in books and movies Evanovich tried to join in with her characteristic protagonist, Stephanie Plum. The usual plot lines of an FTA, the ruined car, and Plum herself with her disorganization meets a new man with abnormal abilities. Plum runs through her erotic arousal theme, her boy friend appears briefly, locks click, lightning flares, family meals occur and everything works out at the meal, there is little suspense."
5,Enduring Christmas Plum fun,"I love this book. Re-read it every Christmas. Some years I'm in the Christmas mood, some years not; some years I have a tree and decorate, some years not. But every year I re-read Ms. Plum's Christmas whacko adventure and every year it makes me laugh out loud and helps me remember to lighten up, enjoy the season and to keep an eye open for miracles."
2,Dud in the Plum series,"I love the Stephanie Plum series but this was a dud. Normally I can finish one of the series in a day, but I couldn't even make it through half of this novella. I'm going to try again someday, but I'd say, just move on to the next book...You'll be much more satisfied."
1,Not worth the read,"I love Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. Unfortunately, this book was a trite attempt to create a holiday novel with little substance, humor or plot. Yes, the Stephanie Plum books follow a certain formula, but in this case, Evanovich took the ""Hamburger Helper"" approach to the book, cut a lot of corners and came up with a real bomb. Pass it by...there are so many better Evanovich books to read!"
4,CHRISTMAS WITH STEPHANIE...............,"is a complete hoot! With the holidays bearing down, the postage stamp-sized yards in the Burg are chock full of plastic Santas, reindeer, and multicolored lights. But Stephanie, as usual, is behind on everything--shopping, presents, decorations, rent! She's in search of an FTA by the name of--believe it or not--Sandy Claws.Hunky Diesel, who appears mysteriously in Stephanie's kitchen one morning, is also looking for Sandy. Diesel's also a bounty hunter of sorts; but instead of packing pepper spray and a gun devoid of bullets, Diesel has a supernatural edge; he can pop locks faster than Ranger and can appear and reappear at will.In her hunt for Sandy, Steph is chased by evil elves pelting cookies, vexed by sister Val who has a humdinger of a problem of her own, and threatened by Ring--an oldster who is also in pursuit of Sandy, who is Grandma's newest studmuffin, and who packs a heck of an electrical charge.Merry Christmas from Steph and the gang!!DYB"
2,Save your money,While this book was amusing it was a total price rip off. The story left you wondering what it was about and never really made much sense. I do not recommend it. I was very disappointed as I was very much looking forward to her next book.
3,Visions of Sugar Plums,"Stephanie really is not being Scrooge, but Diesel is no Ghost of Christmas anything. When the handsome super hero beams into her life, literally, she finds herself on an odyssey to find the Christmas spirit, as well as stopping a super villain and nab her latest skip, Sandy Claws. Helped by the hunk with super powers, she is in for a wild ride and a good time, or at least an interesting one.*** The light hearted humor is timeless, something that can be read any time of the year to revive your flagging spirits. The end, granted, is something you may see coming a mile away, but be that as it may, it is fun. ***"
2,Not Your Usual Stephanie,"Visions of Sugar Plums finds Stephanie in search of Sandy Claws, an elderly man who runs a toy shop. Sounds simple enough, right? Enter Diesel, a mysterious man who ""pops"" into Stephanie's kitchen. With his help Stephanie is on the case to find Sandy. Oh, did I mention Sandy has workers in his toy shop? And they're elves???This book was a major disappointment. A big fan of the Stephanie Plum series I found this book to be boring. It didn't have all the usual characters and the ones that did make an appearance were in the book such a short time. This book seemed to be written in a hurry and not well created. I was in a hurry for it to be over so I could read something else. I kept hoping that it would get better but that just didn't happen.I would recommend skipping this Stephanie novel. It is a waste of time. Not worth buying or spending the time reading."
2,Visions of getting back to better writing..........,"This was a very sad effort from Janet. A wee bit too much egg nog while writing this one? The whole Diesel fantasy character was a bit over the top. There was no good mystery to solve, no Ranger (whaah!) and precious little of Morelli or Lula. Hard Eight wasn't quite up to par either. Please Janet, get back to how the books used to be. You aren't tapped out yet are you?"
1,Not a Plum read,"Did someone kidnap Janet Evanovich? Was she imprisoned by hundreds of wicked elves who forced her to conceive and write this book overnight?As a fan of the ""real"" Stephanie Plum mysteries--which automatically means that I'm not lacking a sense of humor--I say let's get the authorities involved. Someone has to ransom Janet and bring her back to finish the series."
2,Skip it . . .,"I was looking for Christmastime books, since I enjoy the holidays so much. This is horrible. I did manage to finish it, because I HATE not finishing a book. But it never got better. It never even became fathomable. I never laughed. Spare yourself."
4,Cute book,This was a fun little holiday book. Something different from all of the other sappy Christmas stories. Our book club had a blast with it!
3,Sugar Plums,"Very enjoyable read, they just don't last very long when I start on them. Just like peanuts I always want more when one of Janet Evanovich's books ends. Love the story lines."
1,Waste of Time,I have fallen in love with the Stephanie Plum series. I have quickly read through the first 8 books in a period of a month and saw this was sort of in between eight and nine. I bought it (I wish I hadn't) and quickly realized this was a fluff piece for Janet Evanovich. Storyline is unbelievable and new characters are knock-offs of old ones. This has nothing to do with the series and you won't miss anything so I recommend to save your money and time.
2,Check it out of the library!,"I loved every one of the 1-8 of the Stephanie Plum series and eagerly await #9. However, this Christmas novelette needed much more editing! It seemed to me that her editor decided - oh, about July-ish - that a Christmas Plum novel would be great to put out. Heck - it has a catchy title all ready! However, the novel is not fleshed out at all - both the storyline and the characters are weak. Janet Evanovich is capable of so much more.All in all, definitely not worth the price tag, but a quick and brainless read if you can get it at your library."
2,Don't Bother,"This is a short story, with a silly plot that involves a character who is ""some sort of superman type"" with non human powers. Pu-lease! It wasn't even funny, it just was dumb."
2,Disappointing quicky!,"As a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series, I was really excited to see this new Evanovich book, 'Visions of Sugar Plums'. The title alone had me anxious to read it!Not only is it a ""quicky"" read, but a disappointing one. To me, this was easy way to throw a new book out on the market before the holidays to make some money. Evanovich may get the dough, but you do not get what you pay for with this book.Bring back Ranger, add more Morrelli and lose the 'alien' Diesel. I would not recommend this book, but will be on the lookout for new JE books in the future. I just hope there are no more attempts at a sexy sci-fi!"
2,"Eagerly awaited, but disappointing","It's not often that I run to the bookstore and pay top dollar for a hardback, but I always make an exception for Janet Evanovich, who is one of my absolute favorites. This time, however, she is off the mark with a story that just never takes off and makes little sense. This new character, Diesel, is one dimensional and takes page time away from all of our favorites. Ranger is nowhere to be found and Morelli is too far in the background. I found it hard to care about the plot which was convoluted and, frankly, I didn't get it at all. I will look forward to the next Plum novel, though, #9. Janet, please don't fail me now!"
4,short and sweet!,"I enjoyed it. Typical Evanovich. Some are better than others, and the ending seemed a bit abrupt or unfinished, but that's often how books end."
2,not what I expected,I thought I ordered the hard cover of the book. This was a tiny little paperback. I WILL have to get the hard cover to match my collection now.
3,Plum cute,"The Plum family never fails to amuse me..I burst out laughing in public and love all of the characters. I hate the choice of Katherine Heigl as Stephanie though in the movie. I'd envisioned Monique as Lula and Valerie Bertinelli as Stephanie. I will continue to do so, and I thank you for a great read!"
2,Disappointing.,"I have hurtled through the Stephanie Plum series this Summer. LOVE the books with their inept (just like me!) heroine(?). I was pleased to come across ""Sugarplums"" in the library, but I was extremely disappointed in its execution. It reminded me of the equally disappointing Christmas story that Patricia Cornwell wrote for her lead character Kay Scarpetta.It seemed to be an effort to tide us over until the next fully fleshed-out book, but it was really kind of lame in its effort to be wacky.No harm done, I just returned it to the library.Waiting for #12..."
1,Visions of Sugar Plums = Plum Waste of Money,"Save your money, people.I love the Plum series, but this book was nothing but a filler to make Evanovich and her publisher some easy Christmas money.The plot was plotless. The ""new"" character was never fully explained -- basically he was an alien, and of course, a good-looking one, who had skills the likes of which make McGyver look like an idiot. No Ranger. Tad bit of Morelli.The bottom line is: This book is a waste of your time and money. Don't get sucked in!Let's hope Book #9 gets back on track."
1,Come on Evanovich - You can do much better!!,"I am a HUGE Janet Evanovich fan! Living in the U.K. I quite happily paid U.S. prices and shipping fees to ensure that I got her new book as soon as possible. I started to read it the day it came, but unlike Stephanie Plum books numbers 1-8 (which took a mere day to read) this Evanovich book took over a week to read and even then it was a struggle. It's boring, a huge diappointment, has a tenuous plot and at times insults your intelligence. My advice is don't buy it - if you want to read it, at least wait until it's out in paperback or borrow it from a library/a friend. Come on Evanovich - you can do much better!!"
2,Love Stephanie Plum. . . but did NOT like this book,"I love the Stephanie Plum series and I'm feel very disloyal to give this book only 2 stars but it really sucked!!!! I have read the numbered books 1-8 before getting to this one. I love the numbered books but not this one. I feel like it's a necessary evil. The storyline is B-A-D but some big things happen in Stephanie's family that you need to know before you get to #9. There is no Ranger, Connie or Vinnie. They are all mentioned but not interacting with Stephanie. Connie is alluded to but there is no dialogue. For those who love Stephanie and Lula team. . .they only interact for one afternoon and most of it is shopping. There is introduction of a new character (Diesel) who pops in and out of rooms and unlocks doors and apparently is somewhat magical. CHEESY!!! This reminds me of those cheesy Christmas specials. . .but I read this book in September"
1,disappointing flight of fantasy,"I love the Plum novels and when I got them as a set, I was also given this book. I thought wow great. The book was a mixture of feelings for me, mostly disappointing. I love the character and that mixture of familiarity is what caused dismay. The book is a flight of fantasy and though I love fantasy I was disappointed. It took a character I loved out of contex and made me feel disjointed. I am glad I read the numbered series first, so that I will continue to read them as they appear. I have the between books as well and am actually dreading get through them....I hope I do. I feel having a book and not reading it is such a waste and have forced myself to read other books like that. I hope the 'between' books don't end up like that or heaven forbid ruin the other Plum books for me."
2,"What was Janet Evanovich thinking? Oh I know, let me rip off my fans and make a quick buck...",I have read the first four books from the Stephanie Plum series and found them rather enjoyable. This book however is awful. It is quite obvious that this book was written in lightning speed with not much thought or editing. I was quickly becoming a fan of Janet Evanovich but this book has turned me away from her slightly.
2,Visions of Sugar Plum,"I have every Plum novel and have loved every one of them, until this one. I only liked Visions of Sugar Plum. First of all, the story wasn't believable and where in the world is Ranger? He makes the books as far as I am concerned. I can only hope that this was a quick write just for Christmas. Please Janet, go back to the working class Stephanie who can't keep house, can rarely catch a felon but can keep us laughing from the first to the last page."
2,No real vision here,"Let's face it, Evanovich is not the world's greatest writer. But she has an easy style and decent plotting. In this book, her writing has slipped a notch below her usual standard, and the plot is thin. The first 30 pages or so read like a weak first draft. The book picks up a bit in the middle, but then it coasts for while before ending much too quickly, with too little explained, and with too much left undescribed. Clearly Janet did not care to put her best into this one. Another draft or two, some explanation and complication about 3/4 of the way through (instead of fizzling out), some more inventiveness, and it would have been a winner. Instead, all she's accomplished is to ensure that I'll give her next novel a very careful going over before I buy it (or not)."
2,Visions of Lost Money...,"I cannot imagine what Evanovich was thinking about when she created this horrific little 149 page Christmas rip-off. Whatever the reason, this pint sized joke starts out improbable (men materializing in her kitchen??) and ends up impossible (people with supernatural powers??) I am left with... 'Why was this book written?'"
3,A Christmas story for Stephanie,"Just in time for The Season, unstoppable author Evanovich creates a Christmas tale for her perennial bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum. Visions of Sugar Plums (nudge, nudge) introduces Diesel (what a great name) to the already loooong list of recurring characters in Stephanie's life and Evanovich's books. Diesel must be an elf of some persuasion, for he appears in Stephanie's kitchen like magic, in spite of locked doors and windows. Dum-de-dum-dum. But he's so CUTE. And he needs her to help him locate someone, but she ends up needing his help, too, locating a skip, a toy maker named Sandy Claws. Okay, you get the picture?It's not great literature, but nobody said it was. It's cute, and if you like Evanovich's other stuff, you'll enjoy this one."
5,Sparkling Christmas Plum,"I was astonished to read so many negative reviews of this utterly delightful story. I read it three times last Christmas, and may well read it three times again this Christmas. Hilariously funny like all the Plum novels, and with all the delightful supporting characters there, Lula and Grandma Mazur and Valerie and Albert kloughn etc, what more could anyone want. I did feel a slight pang of discontent though when Diesel appeared. ""She's already got TWO gorgeous men lusting after her"" I found myself thinking rather sulkily ""does she really need a third?"" But what the hell, it is Christmas after all, why shouldn't she? The scene where she is attacked by crazy elves is particularly funny. How can anyone who loves the Stephanie plum novels not love this one too? It beats me."
3,Written as a Fantasy,"I have read and been entertained by the other Stephanie Plum novels, unfortunately, this storyline was too far fetched for there to be as much enjoyment as in her other novels. If the whole sequence had been presented as a dream, then maybe it would have been OK, but even with all the capers Stephanie pulls off one imagines that she lives in the real world, and we can identify with her. Although the usual characters are there (her family, Lulu) and the usual elements are there (wrecked cars, etc.) the mystical nature of the protagonists remains unexplained and instead of being entranced, I was annoyed by the contrivance."
3,Not the usual laugh-out-loud funny,"You can usually count on Stephanie Plum for laugh-out-loud entertainment. I love reading the books; they never fail to entertain. However this CD isn't as funny. Lorelai King, who does the reading, has a beautiful hypnotic voice. She would be perfect for reading more serious works. Sara Paretsky's or Patricia Cornwell's novels. Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels are tongue-in-cheek and should be read that way by someone with a gift for comedy. After the first 15-20 minutes Ms. King kind of settles into the character and the story, and eventually brings a few chuckles. Even so, it's great for playing in the car, doesn't demand a great deal of attention and if you miss something it's easy to catch up."
2,"Hmmm, what is this book exactly?","I have always been a big fan of this series. Sadly, Janet's previous novel was barely passable. And now with this one...I just don't know. Halfway through this read, I thought, ""Oh, this must all be a dream that Stephanie's having!"" But it wasn't. This book doesn't really fit with the rest of the series. The ""supernatural"" angle doesn't really work. The plot, isn't really there. And the old favorites -- Morelli and Ranger are almost missing and missing. Something tells me that Janet is written out. She needs to take a year (or two) off. Progress Stephanie. Marry her. Get her away from elves!"
3,Just Alright,"I am a big fan of Janet Evanovich, ALL of her books. This one wasn't bad it just wasn't the best work that she has done. However, I am anxious to get 12 Sharp when it comes out, and waiting for a release date and title on #13 in the Stephanie Plum series."
3,AVID EVANOVICH READER,"Well I look forward to the release of the Stephanie Plum novels...I missed the release of this one so I actually read To The Nines first...I thought that this book was GRABBING for ideas...I still found it to be funny and I always look forward to the trouble Stephanie gets herself into, but I just didn't like the imaginary characters....I like the REAL ones like Ranger and Morelli. I still enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down until it was finished... I just hope that Ten Big Ones gets back to the usual Plum problems and bounty hunting...I love the sparks between Stephanie and the two men in her life...I look forward to more of those sparks, and more of the CRAZIES she has to hunt down!"
3,Great Christmas fun - not to be taken seriously,"Oh come on everyone!!! Lighten up - Where is your Christmas spirit? This book isn't supposed to be taken seriously - It's a bit of seasonal fun. A harmless parody of Santa and his elves and all the bits and pieces that go with the silliest of seasons. If you go into this thinking it will the typical Janet Evanovich novel - you will be disappointed. Read it in the spirit is was intended and you will have a good chuckle, feel good about the season and forget the troubles of this world; if only for the several hours it takes to read this.Merry Christmas to all."
3,George Gently: Series One,"After seeing Martin Shaw as Commander Dalgliesh which I throughly enjoyed, I was disappointed in the character he had to play as George Gently. That's it, after you've seen him as Dalgliesh every thing else pales by comparison."
1,George Gently Series 1,I could not view the DVD's I bought from Amazon because they were not compatible with region 4. I now believe that Acorn Media DVD's are not able to be viewed in region 4 but when you read the web site there is no mention of this. So I have wasted my money.
5,BBC at its best,"I love BBC mystery series and this is a great one. I wasn't familiar with the George Gently series before I read about it here on Amazon, and I'm glad I took a chance. Interesting depth of character in a police officer who has just lost his wife. Interesting young sidekick police officer who has a lot to learn from the older man. I love the north country dialect and especially the gorgeous scenery. After viewing 3 episodes, I definitely want more!"
5,Excellent Deal!,"This is the deal of the century... This bird seed is no longer available locally and I was happy to find a larger size bag for sale at such an amazing price. The usual cost of a 4-pound bag is $16. At $48 for 30 pounds, this is the equivalent of nearly (5) 4-pound bags for free. Also, even though the shipping date was estimated at 2-3 weeks from the purchase date, I received the box only 2 days later. Never seen faster shipping... I hope I can locate this seller again when I run out in a year. ;) Thank you"
5,wonderful compilation of world lullabies,"It's a wonderful compilation of world lullabies. It's good all over the world - doesn't matter if your baby is from Mars or Paris, Amazon or New York, it definitely works!"
3,"Good music, dont know about the lullaby label",The songs are fine on their own and the album has its merits in the diversity of the songs but I dont think these are lullabies at all. The one track from India is definitely not one. The flow is not good. Some of the tracks are jarring.
5,Wonderful lullabies from around the world!,"The mood of this CD is peaceful and the melodies are beautiful. The sounds are sometimes as foreign as they are soothing, but the message of calmness is unmistakeable. It not only works for quieting my toddler down after fun at bathtime, it also works for us parents. Since one doesn't get distracted by deciphering lyrics it's all about the music. I definitely recommend it to anyone, big or small, interested in world music and broadening horizons."
5,very calming,I work in a daycare and always play a cd during rest time.It is put on repeat for just over 2 hours at a time. It is very relaxing and I don't feel like I will go insane as it plays 4 or 5 times in a row!
5,The best CD you will ever buy your baby,"The only word that can describe this CD is Miracle! I purchased this CD for my 5 month old and she has never made it to the middle of the second track with out falling asleep! The first track will instantly stop her from crying, I have never seen anything like it. Even during a bout of hysteria after treatment for constipation, you can just imagine, the minute the first track started she stopped crying and was calm. I have purchased several copies of this CD so I have one in each car and the house. Everyone I know who is having a baby will be receiving this CD!"
3,so-so sounds,"This CD is okay, but has a number of high-pitched, almost whiny songs that aren't very soothing. It wasn't what I was expecting out of a lullaby CD."
3,So-So CD,"I expected something more melodious, more like lullabies. It's just a CD of slow-paced world music, not lullabies. I agree with the reviewer who said some tracks are jarring. Plus, each song is from a different country, and the producer intersperses European with Asian and African, and the result is disjointed -- there's no continuity or flow from one song to the next, which keeps the CD from being relaxing. I didn't find this CD very enjoyable."
2,I thought it would be better,I thought this CD would be much more relaxing. It was too high pitched and upbeat to be a lullaby CD.
2,A little weird,"My almost 4 year old loves music in bed but seemed to be getting tired of his usual lullabies. So I branched out...he even thought the songs were weird sounding. Needless to say, he doesn't choose this CD at bedtime.re"
5,Perfect for Calming,"I started listening to this CD when I was 7 months pregnant to help myself go to sleep. Since my daughter was born 5 months ago, we put it on whenever she has trouble calming down to go to sleep. As soon as the music starts she begins to relax and takes her nap. We all love hearing the beautiful lullabies play throughout the house."
5,Planet Sleeps is Awesome!,We bought this for our grandson who is now almost 3yrs old. We are purchasing another CD for our new grandbaby who is on the way. This is the most calming & beautiful music! And what a wonderful way for children to hear music from around the world!
5,The planet and the baby sleeps,A wonderful CD for the baby and the parents. Beautiful songs from around the world. The baby is out cold at least just after the Sitar music!
5,Fav cam,"I don't use this as much as my other cams because of its size, but every time I get a chance to place it I do and its always super bomber!"
5,NEVER GETS OLD!!!!,"The absolute best album of all time. Has Everything: rock, dance, electronics, & most importantly passion!"
5,Hyrs for the masses,"Whether you love Sinead O'Connor or lead protests outside her shows (in some cases right next to her) you cannot deny the fact that The Lion and The Cobra is one of the best albums to have come out of the late 80's. It is an album that is everything all at once: pop, funk, rock, and new-wave. I first heard this album and had to play it again, twice, just to make sure it really existed. I couldnt believe one crazy, bald Irish girl had written all those songs, and could sing them with so much unabashed heart and soul. Highlights - EACH AND EVERY SONG!!!! Although Troy is the one song every Sinead O'Conner fan smiles at and says ""Thats the one that got me!"" If you've never heard the whole thing BUY THIS TAPE IMMEDIATELY!!!"
3,Misleading listing.,Good flicks and decent video quality BUT the listing is wrong - there are no closed captions.
1,Waste of time.,This book was a waste of my time. It is pointless.I was insulted by the frequent usage of french terms and phrases. France is one of most anti-American countries in the world and there is no positive purpose served by including words and terms of this despicable country in an American book.
4,Typical good Ludlum,"See storyline above.A bit of 007 mixed with some 'True Lies' gives you an idea of what the new Ludlum thriller will give you. The protaganist Bryson gets into so many life and death situations during his deep cover operations, which he obviously always escapes, that you don't worry about him dying when he gets into another one. Bryson is definitely one of those heroes that's almost impossible to kill. This does make for great thrills though, because, as quoted above this review, this is escapist fiction. Nonstop, blood pulsing, twisting, turning, highspeed, whos who, back stabbing and front stabbing Action! One heck of a ride. Sure there are some flaws. How can you make a simple mistake like not knowing that the previous nights weather was severe storms (when they were running old footage over live footage). This, personally, bothered me the most of the little things that didn't quite fit with the premise.Overall an exceptional thriller.Highly recommended."
3,Big Brother Scenario,"Ludlum's latest novel is like a ""1984"" for the new millennium, and relevant in light of today's technology, and takes surveillance and electronic eavesdropping techniques a few steps beyond anything you could imagine. Through a web of corporate holdings, he creates a scenario in which seemingly benign mergers mean that a single corporation can delve into every aspect of a person's life. The scope of the Big Brother operations is slowly revealed almost as a second story line in a fast-paced cloak and dagger tale about a deep-cover spy. Ludlum successfully brings his Big Brother and thriller story lines together at the end, leaving the reader with the chilling feeling of being paranoid. An intriguing read, but not written with a sense of urgency, with way too much non-essential filler stuff."
2,Far from Ludlum's best,"Once apon a time, Robert Ludlum wrote the best paranoid thrillers in existance. His ""Bourne Ultimatum"" and ""Gemini Contenders"" are classics in the field.But this book, as his last several books, is far from his best. It is hurried, sketchy, often incoherent and contradictory. The general plot is a good one, and much could have been done with it, but wasn't.About 2 drafts short of a novel."
1,Ludlum needs better editor as he ages,"The Prometheus Deception is easily the worst book Ludlum has written under his own name. The plot moves in fits and starts and soon degenerates to no plot at all, replaced by a succession of incoherent skits loosely connected by cut-and-pasted descriptions of technology along with various forms of mayhem. It soon becomes tiresome rather than exciting. Additionally, Ludlum is showing signs of ""aging popular author disease--"" he seems compelled to insert periodic references to ""magnificent breasts,"" and his editors seem powerless to persuade him to make those references relevant to the plot. Definitely a bad book-- my copy went into the garbage. I miss the earlier Ludlum."
3,Cheesy but fun,"I finally figured out that you don't have to be a good writer to tell a good story.Ludlum's like this. His style is clumsy, repetitive and cliched, but I found I wanted to read Prometheus despite it.Ludlum uses a simple, but powerful, formula. Take a super agent. Have him do cool stuff we couldn't dream of. Put him up against impossible odds. It still works.A good, thorough edit would've made this better. For now, it's rushed and shows it."
4,My introduction to Ludlum,"Believe it or not, this was my first attempt at a Lundlum book. He has true talent and spins a great tale.The reader does find themselves hit with so many characters at first, that it is quite difficult to keep up, but it's one of those books that you just can't put down. I found myself staying up late just to finish it. I had to see if he could make it off the ship, then faced the China debacle.I guess my main reason for not giving it five stars was just for the ""believability"" of the text. The costumes, ID's, and supporting props just seemed to come a little too easily for a ""real life"" story."
4,More Deception for you Dollar,"This is the first of Ludlum's novels that I have read and I am impressed. The book keeps a quick pace and is action packed. Nicholas Bryson, an ex-directorate agent, unravels a complex and world altering plot to destroy privacy in a way that makes Orson Wells seem optimistic. As to the true nature of the directorate, it is a phantom-like organization whose loyalties are unknown to nearly all. The plot twists are so profuse that after a while it is nearly predictable- but there is always one more around the corner. If you are looking for an adventure novel, you can't go wrong with Prometheus."
2,Whoever edited this book should be spanked.,"In Austin Powers, Scotty says ""You've got a time machine, why don't you just go back and shoot him when he's on the crapper!"" That's how I felt after reading this book.--SPOILER ALERT-- Can someone please explain to me why Manning and Waller allowed Bryson to set up and trigger the disruptor that caused Manning's estate to burn and foil their plans? The scene where Bryson's learns he's been under surveillance for the past 10 years negates the whole plot! The bad guys not only know everything he's done, but everything he's planned to do.And this is just one of many inconsistencies in the book. I give it two stars because finding so many inconsistencies in a best-seller it made me feel so superior."
3,Formulaic,"I really wanted to enjoy this book, as the paperback version was released after Robert Ludlum's death. However, his best work was written in the 1970s and early 1980s. ""The Prometheus Deception"" really seems to be a re-tooled version of his 1980s book ""The Acquitaine Progression,"" in which a character jumps around from country to country, hooks up again with his estranged wife, and discovers there are few people he can trust. Had Ludlum decided to go off on a new writing strategy, his later works may have been as enjoyable as his first few. (""The Osterman Weekend,"" for example, was a novel that not only kept you intrigued, it's final pages were alarming!) Here it seems like he settled on a formula of concocting a character, inputting a number of cities on a map, throw in a few red herrings, and then come up with a finish that really seems to miss its impact (Same thing with the otherwise enjoyable ""Acquitaine Progression.) Robert Ludlum should be remembered for a better book than this."
1,Aaron Spelling meets Ludlum?,"Who wrote this? When I was a kid, I read every available book written by Ludlum and this one is not typical of his work. It is implausible, simple and fill of characters who are like those of some Hollywood cop on prime time tv. Good thing I didn't have to pay for it! Yuck. This book is kindling for Prometheus."
1,Never again,"Haven't read Robert Ludlum in ages and picked up this one at my son's house for a long plane trip. I can't believe it had an editor. The book has so many impossible situations and contradictory things happening that the reader must either be brain dim or just unquestioningly go with the flow of action to enjoy it. And it goes on and on and on. Is he paid by the word?Clearly since he is such a successful author, I am out of sync with his audience, but then again, I don't have to ever be one of them again."
2,skip it,"This book begins much better than it ends. I'm a longtime Ludlum fan (I've read every book he's ever done), and for awhile, I really thought the Ludlum of old was back. I thought MATARESE COUNTDOWN and APOCALYPSE WATCH were just bad dreams I could forget.Nope. This one isn't much better. Ludlum does a great job hooking you with the premise, but then proceeds to go nowhere with it. The much vaunted ""high tech"" angle is rarely reflected in the plotline, which I thought got duller and duller as it went. It was a real struggle for me to finish the last 40 pages or so, because I just didn't care anymore.Overall, it reads like a lukewarm rehash of Ludlum's earlier (and much better) book AQUITAINE PROGRESSION. The problem as I see it, is that the Ludlum of today no longer connects the twists and turns to the story. Instead, the characters just stagger around from city to city, country to country, with little rhyme or reason to be found.Sigh. I think I'll go back now and re-read BOURNE IDENTITY."
3,Standard Later Ludlum,"Robert Ludlum used to be the big name in spy adventure novels. To a large extent, he still is. When you pick up a Ludlum book, you know what you will get: a fast and entertaining read with a Cold War good vs. evil mentality. With his international intrigue, superspy characters and constant action, his writing is closer to a James Bond movie than even Ian Fleming's books.The problem with Ludlum is the same thing as his strength: you know what you're going to get. There are characters dying immediately after revealing a single clue and other characters appearing at the magic moment to save the day. The protagonist, Nick Bryson, is so talented both physically and mentally, it limits the sense of danger he faces...he is no ordinary guy.This one probably rates just above three stars; I'd give it three-and-a-half if I could. Certainly, I will continue to read Ludlum (I've read all but his collaborations); his books are never a waste of time but are always fun diversions."
2,"Fast-paced, but weak plot","Prometheus Deception, like most of Ludlum's books, is very fast paced with little break in the action. It is full of twists and turns, with the unexpected occurring every now and then. However, the book seems like a desperate attempt at coming up with a plot and then trying to make the whole story somewhat sensible (needless to say, Ludlum fails miserably). There are instances when you're left wondering whether the sequence of events or the events themselves even make sense. Yes, we are living in a world of increased government surveillance, but I'm sure Ludlum, being the espoinage maestro that he is, could come up with a better plot than this."
2,Pointless,"While I enjoyed some of his earlier books, this one was a disappointment. Every conspiracy has to have some unrealistic elements in it--after all you read it for the thrill. But Prometheus has too many of them. A shallow plot, an unbelievable character and a totally poitless conspiracy."
1,A complete loser of a book,"This book is a complete waste of your time. Worse than that. I was looking for a new author to discover and enjoy, and a thriller, and the critics' reviews of this tempted me. I enjoyed the first 20 pages or so, and then the book really started to go downhill. Clichés are a given of the genre, but the author takes this ad nauseum. Plots within plots within plots are only tolerable when you care about the characters. You can't in this book because they are so shallow that to call them two-dimensional would be an insult to B-movie plots. I started to think that going blind might be preferable to finishing this......save your money, don't buy it. Save your time, life is too short, don't read it."
1,why bring him back?,"Having been a Ludlum fan forever I anticipated a good read with his newest novel. However, I found this book to be his worst effort.Maybe I missed something but why would Dunn recruit bryson back from a peaceful college existence when Dunn himself was a member of the conspiracy?After that it was down hill all the way. Not only were the confrontation scenes predictable but also unbeliveable. Time after time poor Bryson feels overmatch and is still able to prevail. Not just an operative but more closely related to superman.Hopefully, Ludlum will return to his Bourne style and we can all forget about the ""directorate"""
3,good but not great?,"I enjoyed this book--mainly because I haven't read much of his writings, and I needed a break from the other stuff I was reading. It was a great breath of fresh air. However, I do think, along with some of the other reviewers, that after a 5 year hiatus, Nick would not be nearly as ""up"" on his game as he is portrayed...and the convenient ""I lost my wife, but oh, wait--I found her"" is a little too predictable. You should definitely read this book, but wait till it comes out on paperback--or borrow it from someone."
3,Short on imagination,"This book copies heavily from the Matarese Circle. The premise is virtually the same. There are only two interesting characters (Harry Dunne and Ted Waller) not represented in the Matarese Circle. The action sequences read more like those of a comic book where the hero always manages to escape danger.If you've read the Matarese Circle then this book is not worth the time. If not, I would recommend it over this book."
2,The F-Bomb,"I admit that I am not a Ludlum expert. I read the Bourne series and thoroughly enjoyed them. Granted that was some time ago and my memory may me a little dusty. The Prometheus Deception caught my eye and since I liked the other Ludlum books I went for it. I was pretty disaapointed and read only about 1/4th of the book. The profanity laced dialogs were over the top, to the point of taking away from the story. I can handle some swearing, but the continual use of the F-bomb is a deal-breaker for me. But that's a personal preference. If you're OK with it, then you'll have to deal with the unrealist action that leaves every bad guy with a bullet to the forehead and the good guys never getting hit, even though the enemy are the best assassins from the underworld... It just got to be unreadable."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"We got this as a book tape for a long trip. It actually started well and was intriguing. But it began to get sillier and sillier as it went on, with totally random plot twists, many of which made earlier events simply make no sense at all. I felt like I was reading a Hardy Boy book, only with graphic violence added. By the time it got goofy, I was totally able to predict that the boss would end up bad. When he showed up on the TV at the end, we burst out laughing! Hard to believe this is the same guy who wrote the Bourne books!"
4,Definitely Kept Me Turning Pages,"The book has a lot of action and some really neat 'toys' that the characters get to play with, which for a closet geek like me, definitely left me intrigued. However, the plot appears to leave me a bit flat, and there seems to be a similarity to the plot in this book and two others I have read. The dialogue is a bit too non-believable for me, or rather, has a tad of an unnatural or strained feel.That being said, it was a good read, and one that I would definitely recommend for those who like action. There is a lot of descriptive, but it really doesn't have a mundane feel to it, and has great visual imagery to it."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I do not usually feel strongly enough about a book to offer an opinion, but....This book is more a parody than a thriller. The pace is too frenzied and the ""hero"" is more a ""superhero"". It's so overdone it's a joke.Mr Ludlum has written many fine books. This is not one of them."
1,Who wrote this?,"If it didn't say Ludlum on the cover, and if I hadn't advance ordered my copy, I'd think I had picked up a Gold Eagle paperback off the discount rack. This book has none of the richness and depth of a Ludlum novel. Not only are the characters quite flat, but the plot twists that are the hallmark of Ludlum aren't there. The story is too straightforward, with little in the way of surprise. Ludlum's best is full of ""I didn't see that coming... but I guess I should have."" This book is full of ""He's going to end up doing this..."" and ten pages later he does.This saddens me. I've been a long time fan of Ludlum and was quite anxious to get this book. Now having read it, I'm not all that concerned about when the next Ludlum will come out. I know that Ludlum has done some ""collaboration"" on a men's adventure novel (series?). This book makes me wonder if a hack writer has rubbed off on Ludlum... or if some hack ""ghosted"" this novel."
2,Meh,"Fast paced, but I never developed a connection with the character. I got about half way through it and if felt more like a job than a book."
1,Horrible.,"I recently saw The Bourne Identity in theatres and figured i'd read the book. The library didn't have it so I got this one instead. While I read the whole thing I'd say I enjoyed about every other line except the ending which doesn't make any sense and is really just a cop out.The first thing that annoyed me was that everyone he talks to gets killed just before they are about to provide some information which might move the story along. I don't mind if some of them get killed, but all of them?? That's just silly.The second thing that annoyed me was that at one point Bryson is able to determine in a glance -- in the moonlight -- that a CIA badge is legit, but later on he can't decide if several british policeman are legit or not even though he examines their clothes, their guns, and their badges. Which is it?"
1,The worst Ludlum ever,"Since I'm a great Ludlum fan it was a no-brainer to get this latest novel. Even the prologue and the first chapter were exciting. But that's where the exitement ended. A confusing plot and too many coincidences made this book a gruesome read. Things suddenly happen without logical explainations. I also wonder if this book was edited at all. In conversations between two characters, the dialogue suddenly switches names. Then there are inconsistencies in time lines (first they have 4 hours until 9 o'clock and in the next chapter it is 4 o'clock).But the worst part of the book is the last paragraph that sets the book up for a sequel. Oh no! Not for me"
2,Fails to suspend my disbelief,"I picked this book up because a quick scan of its book jacket suggested it had been the inspiration for the Alias TV series. I'd never read a Ludlum before, although I'm fond of the genre, having enjoyed Clancy imensely. However, I'm abandoning ""Promethus"" 1/2 read. The writing is just plain awful. With their informal, choppy, sometimes even gutter-level language it's difficult for me to accept most of these characters as human, let alone highly skilled spies, DD's of the CIA, or members of the Presidential Cabinet. There's nothing too awfully wrong with the plot - one can see why Alias's creators borrowed from it - but the rest of it is just too hard to swallow. This is one of the few books I've read recently that would seriously benefit from abridgement: if 80% of the useless and silly psychoanalytical prose was eliminated, it may actually be readable - or at least I'd waste less of my time finishing it!"
