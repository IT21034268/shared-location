5,Luv it!,"What a great looking knife set, and a conversation starter. Best thing is that these are AWESOME knives, I use them all the time."
3,Hysterical gag gift,"Although this was a funny gift, it takes up alot of counter space and in this particular case, one knife did not fit into the knife sleeve completely."
5,great product,"I had a very smooth transaction, product was exactly what I ordered. The item is a hard Plastic holder with sleeves to cover the knives in back, so no fear of getting cut as it sits there."
4,Likes what I got,I like what was sent. Still waiting on it to be unwrapped and enjoyed but was pleased at what I bought
3,Knives were extremely dull.,The look of the product was cool but the knives just didn't cut. Not efficient at all. Way over priced.
5,innocent revenge!,"Anyone who likes to cook and has been through a bad relationship will love this knife set! The knives are great and putting them back is very therapudic. Ha ha haThere's a magnetic strip on the inside of each sheath, on the top, so the knives don't rest on their blades, keeping them nice and sharp. This item is a bit big, but the fun factor is even bigger! The surprise element when people see it in your kitchen is awesome!It's safe, sweet revenge!"
1,False Price Advertisement,"Amazon has a tendency of doing this and it is important to understand that their prices are not always accurate, this item is listed as:List Price: $169.95Price: $84.95Indicating that you save $85 which in fact you dont, after a bit of searching on the internet it is possible to get the same item in a number of other stores for $80 and below, meaning their advertisement of a saving is false."
5,Get Your Ship Together,"Finally, a transformational personal development program that puts us in charge of the changes we want. A gifted therapist and behaviorist, Scott Sulak has brilliantly created Get Your Ship Together, a CD program bringing 20 years of experience... and skills for change to anyone, anytime, anywhere. Using this program I've been able to make major life changes in ways that seem to permanently restore spirit, energy and a sense of adventure. Very professional program and accompanying workbook that can work well with individuals, families and work groups. Highly recommended!!"
2,Taschen should be ashamed of this poor edition!,"Pin-ups, by well known publisher of erotica and photo books Taschen, contains generally well scanned and well printed covers of 40's and 50's mens magazines: Wink, Eyeful, Titter, Flirt. And some content from interior pages.However, Taschen has badly cropped most of the cover images. Many of the images have ~30% of the image area missing. It's been cut off!. Rather than adding extra white space around the images so that the book will offer a good viewing experience, they are run into the binding!Avoid this poor edition! Instead I suggest The book: The Great American Pin-up."
3,Great coffee table book!,"I purchased this book to help design a tattoo. It was VERY helpful, and now it makes for a nice coffee-table book! There are a few repeats of photos in this book, but that's because they're from different magazine covers, or different months."
3,OK,"I expected to use the graphics in this book for a project, but the graphics were cropped too much to scan them and tweak them... but the collection of pictures was just great. Lots of images i've not seen, which is always exciting! All in all, a good purchase."
3,Boring overall,"This is for the pin-up artist fan and for anyone curious about the ages of yore. These aren't nudes - they are pretty much just pin-up paintings or little silly skits of women in bikinis or underwear or props hiding the vitals, looking and acting sexy, but coming over more like a housewife who thinks it's all silly. A modern bikini magazine with the models flirting their heat is far more sexy ... Overall: black and white pictures, pin-up covers. ...Actually I found it interesting that one lady hammered together a scooter out of office furniture casters and wood; and Betty Paige is in a silly skit riding a scooter that looks like the ancestor of today's hot new inline aluminum crazes. ...Mediocre. For the fans of older artwork and tame pin-up photos, and for photo buffs who like looking back into the past to see just how much like today people were back then - some things considered."
3,Just Ok,"No nudity and I didn't expect it. It's mainly composed of old (early 1950's) teaser magazines covers. There are some background writings about the magazines and some old ads that are comical now looking back. The book is heavy, thick and small making it easy to crease the paperback binding. Also the reproductions of the magazine cover drawings are cropped and that was disappointing."
5,Massive Book with outstanding value.,This is more than just a huge book with excellent pin up art. It also includes a ton of information about pin ups in general throughout the book. Lots of cool old ads etc. If you want a reference book for shooting pin ups or if you are a model and need a guide for posing - this is the book for you!!!
3,FSalgado,"Tsunami has always excellent videos concerning martial arts, good music, good explanations,etc. Even if the technics were good I have seen better karate trainers performing free sparring, thats why I rated this video with 3 stars."
5,Great puzzle,My three year old loves this puzzle. It's very durable and stands up to use after use. I also like the small carrying case -- much easier to keep all the pieces together than cardboard boxes which fall apart. Definitely recommend for two to four year olds.
4,A great puzzle for toddlers,"My 2.5 year old son received this for Christmas and has put the puzzle together every day since then. I thought it would be too difficult for him and we did have to help him the first few times, but now he's figuring it out on his own. The different colored backgrounds for each section help make it easier, but overall the puzzle is still a fun challenge for 2.5-3.5 year olds. The carrying case is also great. I'm definitely going to buy one or two more puzzles like this for him and try to work out some swaps with friends, too."
3,"Not the best, but good for the money.","I bought this becasue I was staying the summer in a complex with wireless broadband and needed a wireless USB adapter for cheap. I saw the price and dove right in. I found out that there are no drivers in the box for Windows XP, but the Windows 2000 driver included works fine. After scouring the web, I found out that the companym Addtron, doesn't support their networking products. On their site they had a link for a Windows XP driver, but the link was broken. Even after trying to call the company, I still have had no luck getting the Windows XP driver. I haven't used the adapter for much heavy use. Reception is decent, but nothing amazing.Bottom Line: The included drivers work very well in Windows 2000 and work for the most part in Windows XP. If I could get my hands on the new XP drivers, I would be a happy camper. It works well for basic wireless conectivity, but I wouldn't use it for anything extreme."
3,Works well,"I bought this because it was inexpensive. Works well in infrastructure mode with my Netgear MR314 router, Windows 98. Reception is average - good enough for coverage from anywhere inside my house. You can't attach an external antenna. Speed is good enough for internet use. I was able to download the latest drivers (including XP - as of April 2002) and latest firmware upgrade. I applied the firmware upgrade, but I haven't tried it with XP yet.I've haven't had any problems, but don't expect support from Addtron."
3,Sad But in a Good Way!,Close Enough to touch is a book that deals with a teenager (Matt Moran) losing his love (Dory who died of aneurysm). The book focus on how he deals with going to her funeral and continuing his life without her. Would he love again? Is it possible?. He then meets a senior named Magaret Chasen and is immediately drawn to her. Would he get past his hurt to love again? Though this book deals with death it shows the different emotion the character is feeling and you feel like you could know this person very believable. A touching read.
2,i do not like it at all,"This book is very differcult to understand, but basicly it is about a boy and a girl that are going out. They go to see the firewors because it is the forth of July. When the fire works are over they go across the river in there canoe. Then the auther starts to talk about the girl being dead. That is the part that got me cunfussed the most. So it is basically about a boy that is in love with a girl but the girl dies."
3,Picture is misleading.,"Although this is a quality product, I feel that the picture is slightly deceiving. I was under the impression that this item contained 2 arm rests (as depicted in the photograph). The product actually only ships as a single (1) arm support.The build quality is excellent and I would recommend the product, but if you need it for both of your arms, get ready to pay 2X the price shown above."
5,A must for any saltwater fly-fisherman,"At whatever level you are with your saltwater fly fishing, there is a lot of good instruction in this DVD.Even if you already ownFly Fishing in Saltwater,Presenting The Fly: A Practical Guide to the Most Important Element of Fly Fishing,Saltwater Fly Patternsor any Lefty's other books, it really helps to be able to watch him actually do it.Along withLefty Kreh on Fly CastingandLessons With Leftythere is a lot of good information on this DVD."
3,Knight's singing packs punch,"This is the final full-CD effort released by the group before Knight began her current career as a solo performer. It includes one of their biggest and best hits: ""Love Overboard"". Gladys rides the slinky groove with restrained passion, while the Pips support her with some of their most appropriate falsetto cries (""Doot! Doot! Doot!""). The rest of the CD's songwriting and production doesn't live up to the standard of ""Overboard"" (which was written and produced by Reggie and Vincent Calloway), but Knight's singing consistently packs punch. Her throbbing wails ring out on tracks like ""Complete Recovery"" and ""Say What You Mean""."
4,Great Read....,"I just finsihed this book and is the one of the best I have read on the subject. Throughly researched and accurate, well written the only real issue is some of Mr.Reilly's thoughts conserning the Laffite brothers and their sordid compatriots...skip those sections and read William C. Davis ""The Pirates Laffite"", but excellent treatment on the battle and the politics sorrounding it."
1,A Brit's view,"A prospective reader should undersatand that this work is from a Brit's point of view -- complete with an unnecessary telling of which officers are related to whom and descriptions and drawings of British uniforms. Approximately 85 per cent of the book deals with the English side of events. Further, if you wish to read about the Battle of New Orleans, you should skip almost the first half of the book. (I don't suppose I could ask for a partial refund.) Finally, the author's view is that except for an unfortunate series of events the British would certainly have won the battle and seized New Orleans -- ignoring the fact that the American victory was absolute."
2,Melodrama at its highest.,"Day-time soaps have nothing over this program. It is a fine example of writing that is badly researched middle-of-the road pop-psych.None of the characters have any emotion or depth and are simply moved through ""life lessons"" with no will of their own. It's an after school special for an affected generation. Maybe, however, if you're part of that generation, you'll find some solace in scenarios that are no doubt similar to You're So-Called Life."
2,Thirtysomething for People Under Twentysomething,"At last, a show that deals with the tragedy of being young, beautiful and well-off. Boo-hoo-hoo."
5,"So ""painful"", so good","This is one of those cringe-inducing shows that make you embarrased for the characters, but is so engaging you can't turn away. When the show was on TV, I fell ""in crush"" with Jordan Catalano (not Jared Leto, who's actually a decent enough actor that he's nothing like Jordan for real...) right along with Angela. Some of the plot gets a bit ""after school special""-ish, but not so much as to distract from the characters."
5,Finally!!!,"I just love this show! The only thing that bothers me is that not only did they cancel show only after 19 episodes but they left you with one major unanswered question.... What did Angela do after she found out Brian was writing the love letters for Jordan? When it was finally revealed to her that Brian was in love with her?! That is so wrong to leave you with a cliffhanger and no next season to resolve it. We deserve to know, if only in writing what happened with that. Other than that the show was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to own it!"
5,Why are people complaining?,"I just recieved my DVD set yesterday and I have watched 4 hours of it already. I don't know why people are complaining about this set. The sound, the picture, everything, is just how I remember it from back when it was on tv. People should stop whining about the fact that there aren't any special features - you get the WHOLE series! It took so long for them to actually release this - we should rejoice, not complain! I won't go on and on about how great the show is, because so many before me have done so, but I will say that this DVD set is awesome! I love it, and have no regrets in buying it. Take it from me, this is a MUST HAVE set for any TRUE My So-Called Life Fan!"
3,Great Content but the DVD was disappointing...,"I have fond memories of MSCL, a TV show I was devoted to as a teenager. I was delighted to find it available on DVD. Unfortunately, I found the picture quality to be less than inspiring... (perhaps I just got unlucky, as many reviews I have read praised the DVD for its good quality picture?!!) Nevertheless, the script and the cast are fantastic. It's quite frightening how well the show captured growing up..."
5,A blast from the past,I was so excited to see they were releasing this again. I was introduced to this series thanks to MTV and love reliving that time in my life as I watched the episodes. Claire Danes...what a talent before her time. This show really helped a lot of actors and actresses get a their start. It is great to see them all again.
5,The Best Show On Television Ever,"This is my absolute all-time favorite television show. I was in 10th grade when the show aired, so, since the characters were also in 10th grade, I related completely. This is the most realistic drama I have ever seen. I do have other favorite shows, such as Dawson's Creek and Felicity, but this will always take the cake. I love owning this DVD set so I can view the episodes whenever I want.To the person who posted the poor quality on the DVD: The show was originally aired that way! I always thought it was rather strange how dull the colors were but that is how they did it. I won't complain, since the show itself makes up for the camera work!"
3,Disappointing,"I'm not going to review the original series; the series was great. I was very disappointed with this DVD release. The picture quality is not what I have come to expect from DVD. It looks like digital cable. Possibly it has been overcompressed to fit four episodes on each DVD disc; I'd rather have more discs. It is poor. The most annoying thing is the soundtrack mixing. If you play it loud enough to hear the dialog, the background music is overbearing. If you set the volume so the background music level is comfortable, then the music drowns out the dialog so you can't understand what is being said. Much more care should have been taken in transfering the greatest TV show of all time to DVD. The original series gets 5 stars, but this DVD release only gets 3."
5,"Ah, memories","My friends and I LOVED this show when it originally aired. We still use quips from certain episodes as inside jokes. Watching the series again brought me right back to those ackward and intense ""important"" things that made up high school."
5,Wishing It Was My So-Called Life,"I have never felt so hurt and let down as on that ill-fated Thursday evening at eight o'clock, when I saw a rerun of Matlock,instead of my favorite t.v. drama, MSCL. I thought maybe it would be back the next week, but it wasnt. What kind of world do we live in, when 90210 is worshipped and a real original teen drama like MSCL is cancelled? I don't know about anyone else, but, I could relate much more to Angela Chase's life than any of those spoiled rich kids in Beverly Hills, I think everyone could. Am I wrong? I love every episode of this drama. The cast was extraordinary, especially Claire Danes as Angela. I am so glad that they were made into videos because now I can watch the best teen drama ever, over and over again."
2,Waiting for a Complete Release,"My-So Called Life is a captivating bit of teenage nostalgia. It wears well after repeated viewings and DVD is a great format for compulsive watching of favorite episodes. I recorded the series originally on VHS and am ready to get a longer-lasting set on DVD. But, I'm NOT too enthusiastic about getting three episodes at a time. There were only 19 episodes, so could the folks at BMG just release it as one set, please! As soon as the complete set is released, I'll pick it up."
5,One of the greatest shows ever made finally comes to DVD!,"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen! The acting is superb, the writing is phenomenal, and the show itself is pure perfection. You can sit down and watch this entire series and want to watch it again immediately. It is a show that will go down in history as one of the best!!! If you are a fan of Claire Danes or Jared Leto than you need to own this; and if you are a fan of great television than this is a must own!I have already pre-ordered my copy and cannot wait to sit down and watch this series over and over again!!!"
4,neverending teenage angst,"I really enjoyed the show, I love everything that exuded from the 90's. However, this is legit never ending teenage angst. Claire Danes always is crying. But then again, thats the whole point of the show. I loved it!"
4,I think you know you want this,"If you're already here, then chances are you're a fan-in which case you seriously need to consider obtaining a copy of this. Come on, it's got the pilot, the ""Guns"" episode, and ""Dancing in the Dark""(which might be the best single episode of the entire show); what more could you possibly ask for? Granted, the extras are pretty much nonexistent. However, there are previews for the next two discs, which I am now patiently waiting for. Come back home to ""My So-Called Life"" and remember(or discover)just how good TV can be."
2,great show poor video quality,the show it self gets five stars. the dvd collection has very poor quality. it looks like it was done on a vcr at someone's house and burned on dvd. there was not even any liner notes. it looked like a bootleg when i received it. i loved the show and that is the only reason i an keeping it. NOT WORTH THE 70.00+ they are charging for it. hope this helps!
5,My So-Called Review,"First off, I often find myself describing My So-Called Life to friends (it was never shown on free-to-air in Australia) and they're surprised that I enjoy it like I do. Sadly, their general response is, ""But it sounds like a girl's show!"" Alas, these are the same people who believe The Simpsons is just a kid's show.Personally, MSCL depicted the teenage experience better than anything I'd seen, and I was drawn to it from the beginning. Sure, they may have embellished the `teen angst' theme a bit much in some storylines, but that just adds to the appeal of the show. Also, almost anyone can identify with at least one of the show's characters.One of the best things about this new DVD Set, is that those who may have missed MSCL during its initial run, and subsequent re-airings, will now get the chance to see what all the fuss is about. So, buy this set, watch it all the way through, and then watch it again. And like myself, you'll probably find yourself referring it to friends."
3,Coulda been better,"This was one of the best shows of all time, so of course it's great to have the series out on DVD. Come on, though. After all that waiting and not even one special feature. One commentary, interview, featurette. I love the episodes, but for the amount of money they're charging they could have put a little more effort into it."
5,My So-Called Life,"Angela Chase is a stunning portrayal of teenage-angst in the 1990's. With her friends Rickie, Rayanne, Sharon and her infamous crush Jordan Catalano they wade through the murky waters of the teenage years with unabashing honesty and sometimes painful realness. Touching on topics like drug and alcohol use, homelessness, violence, and sexuality, the series does a great job at showing what it's like to be a youth in 90s society. Great character evolution and a bit of a ""plotless"" plot, I was captivated from the first episode. The only thing that wore on me was the lack of Tino, who was mentioned in almost every episode but whom we never actually saw. Worth watching."
4,Pretty decent show with just a bit of annoyance,"This was a pretty good show about the emotional conflicts experienced by a group of teenagers and their family members in the 1990s. The cast is great at conveying the confusion and angst of high schoolers, their parents' consternation, and the younger sister's forebearance.Two quibbles: it is very irritating to hear the word ""like"" used in almost every sentence; nobody could have worn that much ugly plaid clothing."
5,Great DVD set!,I was so excited to get this DVD set in the mail. I have been wanting it for years and finally purchased it on Amazon.com last month. The show is just as good if not better than I remembered when it originally aired on TV. I recommend this to anyone.
3,I didn't buy this for me. I don't know how to rate this.,Don't know. It's a gift. My daughter asked for this package. She has watched it before. The pricing was good too.
1,my so called life complete serier,Not happy dont ever buy dvd's out of the country.i dont know about you but i have never heard of not being able to play the dvd's unless you have a dvd player with region 2. i didnt even know what that ment.
3,Unrealistic and Stereotypical at Times,"This show had it's entertaining moments, but I found it to be stereotypical and very unrealistic. I first watched it as a teen, and my life was nothing whatsoever like those of the characters in the show. The same goes for the lives of all my friends. I also found the main character to be very annoying. Angela tried to be deep but always ended up sounding like a depressed valley girl instead. You had the stereotypical depressed, oppressed teens and also the stereotypical makeup-wearing gay male. I don't get what all the hype was about really."
3,Please issue the complete set of episodes,I'd buy the complete season on DVD in an instant -- it was one of the best shows of all time. But I don't want just a couple of episodes.
4,Bitter sweet,"My high rating may be biased since I loved the show when it was originally on the air but I love the DVD collection even more. The lack of special features bothers me a little bit but the shows are still great on their own. The abrupt end to the series leaves you wanting more but the season finale fits nevertheless. If you were a fan of Dawson's but thought they were too happy all of time or were ever addicted to Daria, My So Called life is for you."
5,If you liked My-So-Called-Life on TV you will love these CDs!!,"This is the very first thing I ever ordered off Amazon!! I always loved My-So-Called-Life on TV in the late 1990's so I ordered these CDs as soon as I saw them...I received them very quickly, great service and at a great price!!! Will order again from this seller."
4,Relive high school,"Watching MSCL brought me back to high school all over again...what with resenting my mom, having a crush on the cool, bad boy....as you get older, experience more relationships, you become more jaded about love, things are just less intense. you experience that one relationship that cut you the deepest and vow never to love that way again. watching this dvd brought back memories of innocence and youth. it's a shame that it ended after the first season. many of the issues in the show are still current today: alcohol/drug abuse, sexual confusion, problems in marriage....all this aside, how HOT is jared leto?!?!! =)"
1,I need much more,"Like every other reviewer, I agree...We need all episodes in a box set. As a teenager at the time, I adored each and every episode. In fact, I have a lot more than three on VHS tapes. I'd love to share this with anyone interested, as I could provide much more than they are offering."
4,life,"This is such a good show! I happened to catch in on MTV and I feel inlove with the boy that lead girl was inlove with, this show had potential to be on much longer! Adleast we got the DVD to cherish."
4,Sucks to be a teenage girl,"I bought this series for my girlfriend, so of course I get to watch it with her. I really enjoy the show, but more than 1/2 an hour of this teenage girl drama makes me want to die; I just can't stop watching it. The show is dark and depressing but redemptive, yielding a paradoxical viewing experience. So if you're into dark and depressing, or love teenage girl drama this is the show for you."
5,Great Collection of a Great Series,"The My So-Called Life DVD set is a good choice for old fans or new. Unless you taped the episodes when they aired originally, this is likely the only way to see the show. And it is certainly a show worth watching. At 18, I was too young to see the show the first time around, but I have loved watching it now.The 19 episodes of the show were all new to me. Yet even years later, I can relate to the characters of the show. The show is admittedly a teenage drama, yet it is entertaining and at times thought provoking. The stories are interesting and amusing, I highly recommend people check it out. To this end, this set is a better idea for purchase than the previously released My So-Called Life DVD that contained solely the first three episodes because the show is too good to stop at just three episodes."
1,Eric Roberts,Eric Roberts is NOT in this movie. I have complained to Amazon and they won't do anything.
5,The excellent mathematics problems book for my kids.,"At first time, I'm looking for some challenging mathematics problems for my grade-6 students. I got the name of this book, ""POW vol 1"", from the Ole Miss website. After I got this book from amazon.com I think this is the right book that I looking for. Each problem (from 36 problems) is very interesting and make my students love my subject more and more. The solutions at the end of the book make me know the way to hint them the right way. So, they ask me a new problem suddenly after they can solved it. I think this book can help my students more active and love the problem solving mathematic really. And certainly, I will wait for ""POW volume 2"" again."
2,Much too pricey,"The other reviews for this book were so glowing that I ordered it sight unseen despite the [money] price tag. When it arrived I was displeased to realize that this is more of a booklet than a book. True it is full of activity ideas, but half of them require you to go out and buy something (A CD, a puppet, a book). The pages are thick and glossy with full color reproduction of 'entertaining' drawings. This means the creators of the book paid a lot to produce it and pass the price tag off to teachers and schools. The final blow was that the book contained only activities, no theory at all. There were no explainations of WHY a particular activity was worthwhile or WHAT it aimed to teach. I sent my copy back."
5,you haven't seen anything like this,"This is a great stuff.See some of the best Yugoslav actors in action.Great insight in generalised Yugoslav matcho man profile.See Rade Serbedjija before he became small role master in every new movie you see.It's great movie,you just have to watch it!"
5,La Voz Romantica de Mexico ... Powerful,"Outstanding music from the past to present. Awesome memorabilia set. There are songs on this CD that goes down in history forever.Vicente's voice is smooth, expressive and passionate. All his music delivers his convictions of love in your ears.A great CD to own. Pick up the second half of this two CD set, and get more from Doñ Vicente Fernandez and just lay back and listen."
2,Used item...,I think the price was high considering this item was a used item. Also page said it was a new item and it was not...
4,OMC Stern Drive Manual,THis book worked out great for my boat repairs. It contained all info needed to fix the water pump and other issues. Thanks. All at about half the price of a new one. It was delived in a timely manner and was in relatively good shape.
2,Book is OK for small repairs.,I bought the book because I wanted to be able to do all of the repairs to my boat. After recieving the book I opened it up and needed to take the boat in for repairs. It did not explain the tilt system emough to properly diagnose and repair it. By looking throught the rest of the book I think this will happen often.
1,Lets down the imprint,"I'm a great fan of the Hard Case Crime imprint - both reprinted classics like Donald Westlake's ""361"" and new novels in the hardboiled style, like Richard Aleas' ""Little Girl Lost"" and Max Phillips' ""Fade to Blonde."" Hard Case Crime has published some of the best novels I've read in any genre.Sadly, ""Branded Woman"" really lets down the team. The heroine is artificial and unsympathetic, the side characters boring, and the writing itself stilted. My recommendation: choose another book from this imprint."
2,Too difficult a read for an educated non-theologian,"I have a college degree in chemistry so am used to reading fairly difficult technical papers. I found this book almost unreadable. For a non-theologian like myself it required a dictionary at hand to allow me to plow through it. Here is an example: ""Fourth, the recognition that there is no universal epistemology, and that our knowledge of entities must conform to their idiosyncratic natures, is an essential realisation in the framing of a just theology."" If that is highly meaningful to you, then this is your kind of book."
3,Wow.,"Simply put, unless you have a PhD. in Physics and Theology, which John C. Polkinghorne does, don't even try. The book is so dense that it took me several times reading each chapter to pull much out of it (and I still feel like there is more in there I haven't touched.)On the other hand, if you do have these PhD's or would like some good light (light being emphasized very sarcastically here) reading, this is the book for you. Polkinghorne did not mean to prove God's existence through physics or math, just open the minds of those that might never have thought that it is possible to believe in God in an Age of Science."
2,Uninteresting and unclear to the common man,"Personally, from the perspective of an educated college student interested in interdisciplinary studies, this book is baffling. Baffling in that the jargon which inflates every sentence coupled with the poor technical writing style completely bother me. The ideas espoused in the text are largely unsupported with any kind of reasonable explanations and made with such enormous assumptions that it makes his arguments weak as water. Nice attempt as a whole, but too ambitious and pretentious."
2,don't waste your money,"- Too short.- Way too expensive ($10 would be too much for this one).- Despite all the cute pics on the cover, he only shows how to sculpt a 3-fingered hand with arm and one flat-backed (refrigerator magnet) face.- Often you don't see what he's sculpting -- you see a close-up of his face while he's *talking about* what he's doing. Seems like half the video is a close-up of his face! I'd rather see a demonstration of sculpting.- Very little substance to this video.- Don't waste your money on this one. (...)"
4,Rip Off,"What a rip off. While the movie was great, I received a DVD copy of the show. This seemed to be copied straight from the TV showing or a copy of a copy. For $12.00 I feel that I was taken. Never again will I ordre from a supplier. Doesn't Amazon review what the supplier is selling? Also, there would seem to be a copyright infringement. Could Amazon be held liable as a contributer to this fiasco?"
1,Its a shame,"This video is great, I wish they can reorder it. I contacted CBS and they do not have the distribution rights to this movie. Anyone know where I can get a good copy?"
2,Kinda like jazz,"Very self indulgent ACTING. Not much there for the audience, unless you are watching for the ACTING. Pretty much total trash otherwise."
5,Awesome!!!,It's a wonderful love story somewhat like Romeo & Juliet and very much worth watching along withGoing Down in LA-LA Land [Blu-ray/DVD combo]. They are worth the money and compliment any gay movie collection.
3,A film that had good intentions.....,"This film was just okay, and nothing more....I did feel for the characters: especially Marcel and Kyle who did truly love each other, but enter April/Cole Kyle's transexual sibling. Who does everything to destroy their relationship. There were times i wanted to reach through the screen and smack April/Cole into senseI've experienced in my own life people like April/Cole who sponge off of others and try to ruin their relationships out of envy and spite....He/she shouldn't be pitied.....The eye candy is one of the redeeming qualities of this entire film...."
2,A step back,"Despite the mixed reviews for this movie, I bought it anyway and really regret that I did so. It's not that it is not well made, it is not that it lacks production values or some appealing performances, but the story is so bleak and the ending so awful that it just left me feeling really disappointed. Every stereotype of the ephemerality of gay relationships is on display here and as such it seems to represent a step back to when the appearance of positive gay relationships in movies was a rarity. I'm not suggesting that there is something wrong in representing the negative side of some gay relationships, but potential buyers and reviewers should be aware that this is not only not a positive view of gay love but an essentially jaundiced and negative one. Viewer beware."
2,Nice leads but bad movie,"As far as gay movies go I have to say I liked the two lead actors. They are cute and were pretty charismatic for a lot of the first half of the movie. But the script is atrocious and the characters get more annoying and ridiculous with every passing minute once the hating starts. I'm sure the transexual brother/sister is everyone's pick for the most controversial character. Personally, I hated he/she and thought his/her blatant relationship sabotage was too over the top. If not the brother, someone in this clique would have kicked her to the curb way before all this drama occurred."
2,Between Sweet And Sour,"Between Love and Goodbye starts out sweet and sexy. I thought I was watching a pretty good gay romance. Then something happens. After about the half hour point, the movie changes tone and goes downhill from there. Characters that were nice and sympathetic turn mean and unsympathetic, turning on each other and making the audience hate them. Not to mention the horrible, depressing ending. Thumbs down."
2,Beware 5-star reviews by the film's Producer,"It is shameful that the Executive Producer, Mich Lyon, for ""Between Love & Goodbye"" offers his film a 5-star review without identifying his participation."
4,Sad but enthralling; great music,"First, let me say that the music and how it was incorporated into the film were very good. This is not a feel good movie, but one which makes you think and feel. It is not a commentary on gays, but a commentary on unhealthy family relationships. Not as upsetting as Edge of Seventeen, but much more predictable. Although the ending was somewhat predictable (Kyle got a clue), I was still moved enough to watch the whole film."
4,It is better than most,"This product is better than most dandruff shampoos you buy in store , or online.It is just as good as some prescription ones. The doctor suggested to me to get 2 different ones, and alternate. So I use a prescription Nizoral, and this one, I only shampoo two or three times a day and that keeps it nice."
5,amazing book,I build ships in bottles and this book is full of scaled ship drawings along with infomation on each ship plus a bibliograpy that can be used for more information. Great for model ship builders or historical information.
4,"Some fascinating ""why is the sky blue"" kid questions!","Jay Ingram makes the science of everyday life accessible, fascinating and readable, answering many questions that we've puzzled over since our days as children - why does it always take longer to get there than it does to come home? how do outfielders catch those fly balls? and, just how do the mosquitoes always seem to find us? My personal favourite is a hilarious but perfectly reasonable explanation as to why we're convinced the eyes in that portrait on the wall follow us around the room!"
2,Macintosh buyers beware,"If you are buying this for use on a Mac you should be aware that the multimedia features touted by Microsoft only work on the Windows platform. You will get the basic Pinehurst 2 and 8 courses and that is all. The CD comes with the 97 and 99 versions of the courses. Since the instructions don't say otherwise, I installed the 99 version but the game continually bombed the system. After a call to Microsoft I found that I had to install the 97 version and was told that if I looked at the very small print on the box I would see that the multimedia effects were only available for Windows."
5,From a Spanish teacher,"When ""Dile al Sol"" came out, my students went crazy for it. So I anxiously awaited La Oreja's next CD. I truly didn't believe they could surpass ""El 28"" or ""La estrella y la Luna"", but ""Cuídate"" grabbed me immediately, then ""París"", then ""Pop"" and my students loved it instantly. We all started dancing to the beats. And what a great surprise to find the hidden track! Can they surpass this one?"
5,"Excellent CD from San Sebastián, Spain *****",Event better than Dile al Sol. I was really impressed with the music and lyrics. I strongly recommend buying this CD even if you don't speak Spanish. I can't say anything bad about it!
3,Striving to be Unique,"The other albums by this band are much more mainstream. This one was an attempt to be quirky and unique. While it has some great songs, and some good poetry, it also has some abrasive songs and random poetry that they hoped people would interpret as artistic.If you are gonna buy only 1 Oreja album, don't get this one. ""Lo Que Te Conté Mientras Te Hacías La Dormida"" is a much better album (though also less unique and quirky)"
5,Haunting Book,"Book deserves all the praise it has gotten. At age 18 I was an aerial gunner who flew 28 missions out of Italy. This remarkably accurate book brought me back in haunting ways to times that seem like a dream to me now. Falstein's hero knew what he was fighting for. He felt others did not. In fact, however, like Falstein, a big percentage of WWII airmen I knew were idealistic in the better sense of that word. A mad man was tying to enslave the world and they in their own way were trying to stop him. That simple! Great book."
3,This is far from a novel.,"This memoir is closer to Fussell's ""Doing Battle"", Thomsen's ""My Two Wars"" or Manchester's ""Goodbye Darkness"" than Heller, Vonnegut or Herr. In 1950 memoirs about schizzy post adolescent bomber crews were far from the main in war publishing. The destruction of young men in air combat was not yet popularized, anti-heroes were not admired, readers were not considering the sorrow, the pity, and the insanity. The editors took Falstein's diary stripped out the dates, replaced the writer with the fictional Ben, and the book was forgotten. Heller takes the same story amplifies the comedy, expands the insanity, writes a real novel around the diary experiences; and delivers that product to his editors just when anti-heroes are becoming cool. Monster bestseller.If you are looking for the war experience Falstein and Thomsen are the choice, looking for entertainment its Heller or Vonnegut. Put this book up on your shelf of memoirs, that is where it belongs."
5,Acurite digital cooking thermometer,"I have used previous versions of this device for many years in several locations. They have all been accurate and reliable. This new one was used to cook the turkey for Christmas. The result was a properly cooked, juicy bird that was removed from the convection oven much sooner than calculations predicted. The thermometer then switched to timer mode, indicating the 'resting' time - a useful innovation. Highly recommended but be careful not to immerse the whole probe in water."
4,Good overall package,"Everything was as expected/pictured with the exception of the knife. The one I received was a razorblade attached to a small plastic handle. It works, just not for what I had in mind, prying, opening shells, slight bending etc. It cuts, but since the blade is extremely thin, it wont do much else than that. Very sharp though. Everything else was satisfactory."
3,"Standard Fare For Rogers, But A Good Bargain","If you are a Kenny Rogers fan, you'll love this set. There's no new territory broken here; just plain old love song covers. None of these songs were hits for Rogers. It's just a collection of standard hits culled together for a good sales ploy. Some are great and others are snorers. However, considering that it is a three CD Box Set for such a low price, you can't lose. These songs could easily have fit on two discs, but quantity is quantity and Mr. Rogers knows all about that."
1,GROW UP HIPPIES.....,FOR MOORE FANS AND OTHER LIBERAL COMMUNIST HUMAN RIGHTS HUSSEIN OBAMA VOTERS LEFTISTS AND POTHEADS THIS IS A DELIGHT.NUFF SAID.
3,Kinda Cute,"These are ok. I dont know if the half size up really helped me too much. I find the length of the shoe is true to size, but they are very narrow. So for me they flop a bit when walking. Not as comfortalbe as they look, but unique enough for me to keep."
5,"A book worthy of any peron who values a good story, even if it's true.","I have been reading this book and I have to say that I am impressed with Mr. Bagnall's research for this book. It is so meticulously researched that it will have a perfect place on the bookshelf next to your shrine to the cool things in the last century. It is a book worthy of ANYBODY who even has a basic knowledge of computers. As with most books of this caliber, the geeks are more likely to garner enjoyment out of this book, but if you purchased anything having to do with Commodore, you are going to garner massive enjoyment out of this book. All literate people should read this book, even if history has no effect on you, you'll truly understand this book. This ain't your mother's history book, folks. Just remember that and you'll be fine."
3,Great Book Except for Foul Language,"I've found this book very fascinating since Commodore introduced me to the world of computer science. At times the pace is slow, but most of the book is an exciting and very enlightening read. I'm glad the author includes technical details that a ""geek"" like me loves.My only serious complaint is the language. The author seems to go out of his way in capturing and recording the harsh expletives that came forth in interviewing various engineers and managers of former Commodore. The excess of foul language in this book adds nothing to the story being told - if anything, it serves as a distraction.This review isn't for everyone - as a religious man, I found the language offensive, and people with similar views should be made aware of the use of excessive use of expletives in this book. Those who do not care about such things will probably find the book more enjoyable than I did."
5,An exciting story with a most unfortunate ending,"Commodore didn't have to die, at least so young, had management got their act together. But, we know they didn't. And it's a terrible shame. At least we'll always have the memories.This is an excellent read, especially for computer geeks. Be prepared to feel nostalgic!"
4,38911 Bytes free,"A must read for any Commodore fan or anyone that wants to learn more about the early days of personal computing. If you think Apple or IBM invented the PC, you need to read this book.As a C-64 and C-128 owner 'back in the day', I was looking forward to this title. There is precious little information in print about the internals of Commodore and the real story behind the company. I was not disappointed. Bagnall's book is clearly well researched, and manages to present some of the difficult situations and conflicts without overly taking sides. There is plenty of trivia about the machines themselves and the chips inside, but the real story here is the people that designed them. My only real criticism is that the book is a bit dry in sections - it's primarily a history and could have benefited from some more narrative. Recommended."
5,A wonderful book about Commodore!,"""On The Edge: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore"" is over 550 pages of the best insider information on Commodore that I have ever read. The book chronicles the dramatic rise and fall of Commodore as a computercompany between 1976 and 1994.There are so many wonderful anecdotes and stories in this book. My recommendation: BUY IT!Paul"
5,Blast from the past,"A must rtead for anyone who owned a Commodore computer, or someone that wants to know how C= influenced modern PC's"
1,The gospel according to ada,I am trying to do some quick refresher reading on ada for a job interview and this book has been sitting around unread since i went on an ada course 5 or so years ago. It would be less painful to swallow this book whole and pass it out the other end in the same state than read it. Its riddled with profound opinions on the philosophy behind the language and i skipped the first 4 chapters as irrelevant rubbish but still have the rest padded out excessively with this stuff instead of getting down to the actual language. I think I should have read the book I got back in 1983 written by the course lecturer instead even though it was published before the language was finalised
5,A WORK OF BEAUTY,"I had the enormous pleasure of meeting David Bretton today, the lyricist on this album. Sadly, Duncan died some 13 years ago, but we met to discuss the forthcoming book I am writing about his life and work.Few albums touch a listener in the way that this album can. The musicianship is of a very high calibre, the singing is divine and the songwriting exceptional. David and Duncan had a good thing going at the time and it is a relief to know that this album is readily available - a polished gem waiting to be unearthed by a new generation."
5,Great fun for the whole family!!!,I watched all of these shows as a child. I still enjoy watching them just as much as I did back then. I've never heard my grandkids laugh so much. Great fun for the whole family!!!
3,Misrepresentation,"UMMM, this product was OK but the dvd i recieved was different than the picture shown, it still had the same episodes but the actual package was completely different and a little shottier, i think you should mention that in the [roduct description"
3,okay,I have always watched the little rascals as a child and never missed an episode. I ordered it to bring back memories.
4,Why no subtitles?,"I'm not surprised that Hallmark doesn't plan to release any more of the series. They didn't even bother to include subtitles in this edition. The sound quality is already poor, and subtitles would help young viewers and non-native speakers understand the dialogue of these motion picture classics.As for the series' putative racism, there is certainly much more racism in today's children's shows--for example, in South Park--though the racism is against white Christians.KB"
2,Good music but exercise is useless,"The lullaby music presented in the DVD and CD (3-4 songs)is really nice. It feels very peaceful and pleasant.However, I must say the exercise portion of the DVD has no value to me. It is not a well structured exercise at all. You don't need this DVD to do that sort of activity - just hold your baby and move side by side with the music. I don't know why this DVD has such high rating.If I can choose again, I will just use a lullaby CD and hold my baby to move around as an exercise. No need for this DVD."
4,Fun and time-efficient,"I started this when my daughter was 4 months old. It was the only way I could get in a workout. I could do it when my 2 year old was sleeping and it would put my daughter to sleep; if I did it while my 2 year old was awake he danced along with us. If you are at an excellent fitness level it really isn't a workout, but if you just want some exercise and want to do it with your baby it's awesome! I also enjoyed the music as the singer's voice is very relaxing and helped me relax. Now that my daughter is 6 months she's 16 lbs so it's more difficult but we still like it."
2,"Love the unique music, but this is NOT exercise!","The music is original and fun. I love it! But don't buy this for the workout! The only good part was the squats and I don't need to follow a DVD to do those holding my baby. Anyone who has ever exercised in their life will be very disappointed! They do push ups standing up while pushing your arms against ""air""...hello? That does NOT work your chest muscles. The lady is also kind of annoying. It's a waste of money just for the music, but luckily we are at least enjoying that part."
3,Careful! Contains Sugar Alcohols!,"Careful! Contains Sugar Alcohols!I wasn't able to enjoy these as they contain sugar alcohols. Shortly after having some, I had sever flatulence, cramps, and later heart palpitations, I stopped eating these.Apparently I am sensitive to Sugar Alcohols.They did taste good, though."
4,Tastes great!,These sugar free Milk Chocolate Raspberry Jelly candies are really great tasting. You would never know they were sugar free. The only thing that could make them any better is if they were covered in sugar free dark chocolate.
5,Favored to Win Won Me,If you like good a good read you will like this book by MaryAnn Meyers. Its informative and you can tell she really knows her stuff when it comes to horses and the track. The story line is good and her characters are believable. Every one of her characters has a story behind them and I like that. Ms. Meyers blends them altogether and out comes a very good book. I recommend it if you want to sit back on a winter night with a good book.
4,A Winner All the Way!,"""Favored to Win"" introduced me to an exciting new world - the world of thoroughbred racing. I really enjoyed the characters, including the dark ones that you ""love to hate."" This book had everything: mystery, romance, adventure... I've been recommending it to all my friends!"
5,Favored to Win,"""Favored To Win"" was one of the most, if not THE most enjoyable book I have read in a quite some time. As an equestrian, I definitely enjoyed the behind-the-scenes look at the racing world; however, the characters became almost like family. When I finished the book, I felt as though I had lost some friends. Each character was developed with his/her own personality and personal challenges and triumphs. An excellent, enjoyable vacation into another world!"
5,You feel like part of the family,"what a great read. It pulls you in and you start to believe that is where you are. Then by the 2nd book, your a part of the family. stunning book and one of my all time favorites."
2,Slooowwwwww moving,"Long, boring, very slow moving. Plot (if you can call it that) jumps around all over the place. I don't like to not finish a book and it was an effort to get through this one."
3,insanely neutral,"This movie was a nice show if you like to watch naked women with breast implants. This content was okay, but the women in it are beautiful and this film would be widely enjoyed by male nymphos!"
4,Sabre types and history,I purchased this book as part of some research I was doing for my own book on the F-86 Sabre jet and it had exactly what I was hoping for. I learned about the development and various types of Sabres that were produced since its debut.I can definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about this nimble Korean era fighter jet.
3,no longer hopesfall,"There are only two remaining members in Hopesfall, Jay Forrest and Joshua Brigham. The Hopesfall I know and adore has diminished with the new line up that came with A-types. Magnetic North is better than A-types(not hard to do), and not too bad if the band didn't have to follow up No Wings and Satellite Years. I honestly believe that they would have done a lot better if they would have changed the name of the band. At least then they wouldn't constantly be compared to ""old hopesfall"". It's an alright album. Although, I miss the epic breakdowns. :("
5,solid release,"This is a very solid release, combining elemements of melody with hardcore. Some of the songs are a little abstract, but still very good. I prefer ""A types"" to this cd, but both are worth the money."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"In terms of studio production this album is the most elborate the band has made. In terms of composition it's the most basic. Too much designated lead guitar which is rarely melodic. Too much reliance on echo effect pedal to generate atmosphere as though it's often used instead of harmonies. Secondhand Surgery, Vacation/Add/Vacation and Bird Flu are as good as anything they've ever written, but the rest of the album seems lazy, artificial and at points more blatantly Deftones influenced than they've ever sounded before. Going on what others are saying, if you're a vocally oriented listener you'll prefer this album to A Types, but as a guitarist I find this to be a less intricate, thought-out cohesive record, and their first to contain parts that I've found objectionably trendy, namely the muted lead guitar picking."
5,Keli is excellent!,"This video is great for all fitness levels, Keli's cueing is excellent, she knows what she is doing and you'll get in shape in no time, her other video Circuit Training is excellent too."
4,love this tape!,"love this workout tape. if theres any step tape that i have to do the rest of my life, it will be this one without a dought!"
3,Not Good For A Beginner!,If you are just starting with step aerobics - do not get this tape. She is too hard to follow because she doesn't get you used to the step. By the time you figure out what you are doing you are on to the next thing. Stopping and rewinding is frustrating. Definately a tape for more experienced steppers.
3,Good Workout,"I really wanted to like this one-it has great reviews. But somehow I didn't feel it was challenging enough. I used the 8""step, and I still didn't feel I was getting a good aerobic workout during the advanced portion. I'm not in that good a shape, but this isn't my first step video, either.Also, there weren't a lot of lunges, leg lifts, etc. in the video to really work your legs."
3,Good workout but requires considerable patience.,"I had never done step before this. I bought this tape as a quick, simple method of keeping fit in a life where I am short of time. Its a good workout but I had to approach it in 15 minute chunks until I got used to the step changes and cues. I would have to agree with the reveiw on 28th November. The cues were not very good and gave nothing like enough time to prepare for the change of step for the inexperienced beginner. It took me about ten attempts before I was fully up to speed with the video. Once this problem has been overcome the step routine, as I said, is a good workout but not too complex for the beginner. If you are a person without a reasonable degree of physical coordination or no patience, buy another tape or try something else."
5,great basic step workout--hard to find any like this,"In recent years, I've noticed that step video producers have tried to figure out the most impossible routines for steppers. This video has the basic, fun and original type of a step workout that many still prefer. You don't have to concentrate, like you do with many step videos in the past 5 years. I wish more videos were still designed in this way today!"
1,"You're kidding, right?",She doesn't do the same movement twice! I didn't get a chance to get a decent workout because I couldn't figure out which direction she was going next -- her instruction on her steps was non existent. It will work well under a table leg to help balance an uneven table and that is about it.
5,Great Step Workout-But Not a Beginner Tape,"I have been stepping for years, and this tape was a little challenging for me, so this is not for a beginner. It moves very quick, which is good if you are familiar with the typical steps. Keli is very motivating. This is one of my all-time favorite step workouts, and I like the weird yoga thing at the end too."
5,This will be your favorite step tape you buy!,"This is, by far, the best step aerobic tape I have tried. She actually works out, instead of dancing around on a step. You can adjust your step intensity to fit your aerobic need. after college, I could not find an equivalent workout to what I became accustomed to at the school fitness center. This tape was closer than any aerobic class or tape I tried. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a workout that keeps your heart rate up for an extended period of time... and I wasn't bored."
3,Very good,"She takes a little getting used to, and it does take a while to learn her steps I advise having a couple of ""rehersals"" before trying to get your workout or you might get lost a few times. But you definitely get the workout you were promised."
4,Keli Roberts - Ultimate Step Workout,"Overall a good workout video. You really get a good workout and feel it when you are done. The negative is that it is hard to follow first couple of times, but once you get used to the way she describes the steps, you will do okay."
2,Frustrating Video,"I have been involved with step aerobics for many years both in live classes and using videos. This particular video was the most frustrating video I have ever tried to step through. I even put this tape away and then brought it out later to give it another try. It was a waste of my time. She doesn't cue very well and she is hard to understand. By the time you think you might be getting it, she changes the move without cueing first. If you want a good video, use Kathy Smith's step aerobics. All of her step videos are great!"
2,Not the best for a beginner - Transitions are rough,"While the workout helps you break a sweat, you have to overcome some challenges with the instructor. The transitions are not smooth and as a seasoned stepper, I would have expected a higher caliber lead. As someone else mentioned, Kelli refers to some of the moves using non-standard terms. While different terms are acceptable, the instructions and demonstrations were a bit challenging to grasp simultaneously. I had to stop the workout several times to grasp the movement and count. At this point, I've got the routine down and I like the progressive intensity. I would not recommend this tape to a beginner. I recommend the Reebock Step Workout."
4,A very good work out - took some time to get it down,"My only negative is yes , the cueing isn't very good. However , the workout is - the steps are complicated (I love a challenge) , the heart rate is up and the background music isn't obnoxious , a pet peeve of mine. I really like both the Roberts tapes I own and haven't found anyone else I like nearly as much. I am an avid exerciser , and when I do my work-outs I want them to be effective and challenging , not a waste of time or energy. This is a great tape for anyone to use , including beginners who don't mind taking a little time to learn the moves. She's broken it down into 3 segments for beginners , intermediate and advanced , so do what you can and keep pushing the limit!"
3,A Good Workout,"The video give you a good workout. I found myself at or slightly above the targets hb/m. I think Keli is a good instructor because she encourages you to ""keep trying,you'll get it"". She also works all your muscle groups well. She has to tell you to ""keep trying"" because her cueing is horrible. I have been ""spoiled"" by Gin Miller and Karen Voight who always informs the class on where they're going. In their tapes, don't feel ""left behind"" or like you're trying to ""catch-up"". If she become sharper with the cueing, I think she would be an even better instructor."
4,Challenging Workout-Intermediate/Advanced,"This is workout will definitely get you sweating and your heart pumping. The choreography is challenging and fun. Keli does have other members demonstrating both less and more intense versions of various moves.Be warned that this workout is not really suited to a beginner. The choreography is a little complicated and the pace rather quick. She does not do the best job breaking down steps nor cuing (as other reviewers have written). If you are looking for a good, solid beginner tape, I would suggest Kathy Smith's Step Workout. Once you have that mastered, try moving on to this one. You'll have a blast."
2,Exhausting!,"The cover was cute. The premise sounded intriguing and fun. Even the first chapter left me wanting more. Then the couple left Vegas and the boredom began. Gerrick and Gina went in circles repeatedly. He wanted her. She didn't want him. But then she wanted him only he didn't want her. He was willing to try again but they quarreled and then she wasn't. They were confused and so was I! To top that, each over-analyzed what the other was thinking and feeling. Even the loves scenes weren't exciting. Gerrick and Gina kept talking about their passion but I sure didn't see it. When the story ended happily, I yelled, ""Finally!""I realize there are other books in this series and the compulsive part of me wants to read each and every one. Unfortunately, the silliness and stiff writing style don't motivate me to read further."
4,Family Tree Maker... a great tool!,"We purchased Family Tree Maker 2005 to begin recordng our family history. The tools included and bonus extras have helped us to research our roots far beyond our expectations within the first few weeks. Using the internet we have been able to document a good deal of the records of our immediate ancestors and gather some clues to even much earlier family ties, even from earlier centuries and across the waves. Quite a bargain."
3,"Perhaps Not Academy Award Material, But Geeezzzz... Use Your Imagination!","Does every film have to have a great plot, a well-written script and talented Actors? I think not. I have no idea whether Mr. Estevez is planning on any future Acting Lessons, but as long as he maintains that hunk of a body and keeps the macho attitude, I'll watch everything (or should I say, anything) he makes. I use my imagination frequently while watching his performances and enjoy every inch (oops, did I say inch, I meant to say, ""image"") my mind can produce.Granted, the entire production could have been better in many ways (i.e.: complete nudity for Mr. Estevez's character whenever possible), but with a copy of this film and a few minutes of privacy, I add a little imagination and it becomes a wide-awake wet dream.BRAVO!!!"
3,What happened to this guy? Why isn't he still around?,"A house-music vocalist with a strong, gritty voice equally capable of smooth downtempo and midtempo pop-soul, Colonel Abrams (born circa 1958) made this pop-oriented album in 1987 best known for the song ""How Soon We Forget."" Not entirely flawless, but also worth hearing for the underrated mid-tempo track ""Caught In The Middle."""
5,"Great music, great sound",A fantastic collection of music that traces nearly 30 years of the evolution of Soul. Sound quality is very good and the set is a pretty good bargain. Recommended!
3,FROGGER< a preschoolers first love.,"Not exactly what I expected. My preschoolers stood in line all morning for FROGGER. I got this version to tomake sure they gotto play , but it wasn't as simple or as much fun."
3,Fire fly swamp boss,"I purchased Frogger the rescue.I really like the game but I am stuck at Fire fly swamp boss. I have no idea how to go further. Who is mecanical frog. How long do I have to avoid the cat fish before I can go to the next level? I keep playing up to almost 3/4 of an hour without getting hit by the cat fish, but can't go any further. Can anyone tell me what the trick is?"
2,"Single player good, multi player requires exernal controller",I paid full price ($19.99) for this game for my son's birthday (he loved Frogger I and II). Single player mode is very fun but multi-player mode requires external controllers which we don't ( and never will) have. That really stinks - had I known I would not have bought it.
5,GREAT FOR HCG DIET,"These breadsticks are HCG approved and are so tasty, way better than Melba toast. YOu have to buy a whole case, but it is worth it. First taste of ""bread"" in months!"
5,"Excellent product, excellent vendor service",fast delivery. the packages of grissini were actually larger than i thought (and great for the office munchies).
1,Grissini torino Breadsticks,"Although the flavor is excellent, the breadsticks arrived in pieces. The longestpieces were about 4"" long, but most were 1"" or 2"" and there were lots of crumbs."
2,misleading order form,It was very misleading to me whem the ad on Amazon said pack of 12. I assumed that meant there were 12 breadsticks in the 3.5 Once box and I ordered 2. Imagine my surprise when a huge package arrived and I unpacked 24 BOXES of the breadsticks. We'll be eating them for years (if the shelf life is that long) I was very disappointed that I spent unneccesary money on something I certainly didn't need.
5,A+ Flavor,"These breadsticks are delicious!! Each box has about 9? little pouches, each include about 10 little breadsticks which is about 110 calories. They are quite flavorful, I use them when on the HCG diet, but when ordering from amazon, keep in mind this is for 12 BOXES!!! Which is a ton of these things!! I used the extras over the holidays for an apetizer with a sour cream-based dip... AWESOME!! Definetly worth purchasing and trying!"
3,expiration date,"It's says that the expiration date is located somewhere in the package. But, I was suprised that there is no expiration date - I was looking everywhere- on the product I got. I need to know that detail please.Thank you,"
1,Cuban Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: The Social and Economic History of Monoculture in Matanzas,The book is more an ideological discourse than the Hisotry it claims. I would return the book if I had the opportunity.
4,Does The Documentary Capture The True Chet Baker?,"If so, then the man led a pretty pathetic life. If you enjoy and admire Chet's music and voice but don't know much about the man, do yourself a favor and skip this documentary. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. The documentary, film-wise, was fine ... typical documentary. But the man the documentary is about is another story. Was it the drugs? Was it the ""too much, too soon"" syndrome? Was it all the adulation and fawning from his female following? The man was a cad. I can't believe some of the women he used kept coming back for more. It took some time aftering viewing the documentary before I could listen to his music again. I gave the film four stars because, again, film-wise not a bad documentary (especially if it really captured the true Chet Baker.) The man? I'd have to give him one star. His voice and music? Five Stars."
1,mea culpa,"I regret this purchase because I didn't know that region 2 DVDs will not play on my american players.This is all my fault for not knowing, but it is useless to me anyway."
3,Worked Half-XXX,"The DVD would not play on my DVD player that is two year old, but it did on my older PC."
1,Don't buy dvd's that come from England. They don't work,"I bought the video ""Let's get lost"", the Biography of Chet Baker (1988). It is no longer available anywhere, but I found a copy on Amazon for $2.98. This shipping was around $15. Little did I know it came from England. I have been unable to play it, as the format is different in North America than the UK. Be warned."
1,The DVD didn't work,The DVD didn't work in any of the DVD players I own. By the time I played it the shipping packaging had been in a landfill for several days so I didn't know who to contact
1,Another '50s box set that are pale imitations!,Stay away from this collection! Its yet ANOTHER Madacy collection with terrible re-recorded versions of some of the greatest songs ever made. This crap should be taken off the market!
1,the formula has changed,The Wild Yam Cream you get is not the one in the peach and cream colored box. It is a different formula and now comes in a purple box. It irritated my skin and turned it red. I don't recommend it if you liked the old one...
2,cheap plastic,The battery magazine is made from brittle plastic that will self distruct during the first few loadings.
1,Didn't get the kit ordered-just got the refills,"I ordered this ""Kit"" from Amazon and just got the refills, which is just paper and a frame. Wanted the kit with all it said it came with. I see that Amazon is aware of this and is looking into?? I hope they decide to send me the kit I really wanted. Otherwise, good product."
4,Our daughter LOVES it!,Holding my 10 month old in the water was getting so exhausting as she is so active and loves the water. I purchased this float to give her a little more independence in the water. She loves it and it gives us a break. I love that it is mesh in between the outside float and where she sits. She can splash and blow bubbles in the water. The only thing is that when she gets really excited reaches towards something she wants she can almost push herself out of it. I would definitely recommend it!
1,Terrible Product,"Just arrived, bought 2 for kids bday bikes. Within minutes out of the box they both had something rattling around inside the casing. One refuses to lock, the other's cable refuses to retract. Garbage, very disappointing. Novel idea...poor craftmanship. Sent back for refund. DO NOT PURCHASE"
3,Master Lock 460D Retractable Cable Lock,The cable does not retrack when the button is pushed. To get it all the way back into the housing the cable has to be extended and then helped back into the housing can take three or four trys to get it all the back in.
1,Very disappointing,"Great concept, but you get what you pay for. None of the four I ordered retracted consistently, or at all, even from the get go. Reviews I read before purchasing were mixed, with good outweighing bad, so I took one person's advice and ordered two--you can always find a use for a second lock! When the two arrived, one didn't work, so it went back for an exchange. Ditto the exchange. Ditto the exchange. One of the two originals worked twice, and then it too, seized on retraction. I will now pay twice the price and hope a different brand works better. I think the design is flawed: The cable is too thick for the retracting mechanism. I'd hoped the company's usually good products would come through, but not this time."
1,Poor construction,"The lock arrived with a piece rattling inside that looked to be broken off the locking mechanism. The receiving insert would not accept the end of the cable and hold it. However, even if the lock had worked, it would be too easy to break. The case is just plastic. If you need security, this lock doesn't provide it. If you just need to deter little fingers, a baby lock is a cheaper and more effective solution."
2,Pretty much a piece of crap with a cable attached,"We bought this thing to keep our luggage safe while traveling via train in Europe. It doesn't work right, and it cheap and flimsy. I'm pretty sure I could rip this thing in half if I tried hard enough. Shame, I was hoping this would actually work."
1,Jammed right out of the packaging,"In the course of setting the combination, the cheap plastic button on the lock jammed, permanently locking the lock. I should have shipped it back to Amazon immediately, but I delayed getting around to it for 4 months (because boxing it back up and returning to the post office is a hassle for me). So I ate the cost of the lock plus shipping. Grr. The packaging says ""Lifetime Guarantee"" but don't delay in returning it if you have any problems. My advice: buy it at a store so exchanging it is easier."
5,Very Nice Lock,I ordered 7 of these locks for use at work. I was afraid that at least one of them would be broken and have something rattling around inside as other reviewers have stated. This was not the case.These locks are very easy to use and perfect for keeping things where you want them to be. Haven't had any problems out of them so far.
5,Exactly what we needed!,"We needed a simple lock for our refrigerator. The first thing we had was a bike lock, but that had to wrap around the fridge handles too many times and was a pain. This is exactly what we needed! So glad I found it."
4,Good for the price,"So the locking mechanism is made from plastic, still enough to deter thieves at the lodge, don't expect to lock your bike with it."
1,Causes cancer.,"A tiny sticker on the back reads: ""WARNING: This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""The thing is, they don't tell you which ones. This lock is going to the dumpster."
1,Broken within weeks,"I bought this lock to lock a cabinet that some, but not all, of my students need access too. Within the first day they pulled the cable out without using the code. Two weeks later the button that holds the cable down was stuck in and now the lock won't lock. Can't believe this lock can be sold as a Master Lock. I'm totally disappointed with it and will never buy another one. Master Lock you let me down."
3,Not very secure,"It's an interesting idea, but as far as security...it's lacking. The cord easily pulls out, even when it's locked. Luckily I'm not using it as a real means of security, just a deterrent."
1,Fragile design is flawed,"I ordered two of these for my Jeep. One came with the release button jammed in the package, and the second one jammed the first time I tried to use it. Cable did not retract after the button jammed, and device would not lock. A great concept, but the implementation is very poor. Avoid this lock."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND WHY,"At the advice of the NY times review I purchased two of these locks. One didn't work, so I returned it, and got another that didn't work, and for exactly the same reason: the PROBLEM is that the ""release"" button -- the larger button on the right hand side of the image -- is a tiny, fragile plastic lever arm that holds the retraction spool in place with a hook measuring at most 3 mm. On one of the two locks, it arrived already broken, and on the second, snapped immediately. The result is that the cable does not retract, just flops around. You have to hand-thread it back in, with the spool wheel jamming on the broken fragments from the lever arm which are bouncing around inside the lock. This is an example of extremely poor design, with the key moving element, the one subject to the most stress and use, made of cheap, flimsy material. Master products are usually excellent, but this is a deeply disappointing bomb."
1,Broken Lock,"I bought this for an international trip, but never was able to try it because lock was broken even before I took it out of package. Do yourself a favor do not buy this product."
3,"Decent product, dumb sticker","The lock works as described by other users. My issue is dumbness on Masters todo... The instructions are ridiculously small font. I can barely read, and know my dad would say wtf! If he tried. Second, Master put a round colored hard to remove sticker on the lock with somewhat of an instruction to set your own combo.. Easy fix for the dumb a$$ employee who decided that would be a good idea.. Increase the font on the paper instructions and get rid of the stupid sticker stuck to the product. Or, use an easy to remove no residue adhesive. Maybe something from 3m. So, 3 stars for dumbness.."
1,In the garbage,I bought this lock to lock bags while traveling through europe on train but I threw this in the garbage within 5 minutes of getting it from Amazon. It's too cheap to return to Amazon. A small loose washer was rattling around inside it. This loose washer could lodge itself in the mechanism and cause a malfunction. Also the wire is thin. A better solution for me was a bicycle seat cable and a small padlock.
2,Do not leave alone for more than a few minutes!,"Just a hint... Get out a piece of a paper and write down the numbers 000-999. Time yourself. That is the MAXIMUM amount of time you can leave this lock unattended.If you use this cable lock (or any 3-wheel combination lock) in a hotel room as an alternate ""safe"" while you are out for the day, any thief will have more than enough time to sit around and leisurely brute force break your combination. On average, the thief will need half the maximum time to do so."
1,Completely Worthless,"I bought this for a trip to Europe, just to lock up my bags while on trains and in cheap hotels. The lock broke before I even used it. The code worked perfectly, but all you have to do is lightly tug the cable and it detaches. Completely worthless. Do not buy this product."
2,Cable too short,Disappointed as cable is too short for most ski racks. Have to squeeze skis along the edge of ski racks
5,nice and easy,easy to use. Easy to set with your own combo. fits in your pocket. Nice length cord. just good all around
4,Works well for strollers,We use this lock to lock up our stroller when we have to leave it out in public. The retractable cable is so easy to just loop through one of the wheels and we just have it locked on the stroller handle when not in use. It isn't heavy duty but for us that isn't an issue since we use it to deter someone from just walking off with our stroller as if it were theirs. Can't beat the cost of it either compared to the expensive stroller locks you will find in baby stores.
4,A great lock for snowboards,"I've had this product for over a year now and it keeps my snowboard safe. I've had zero issues with it, I just wished it was slightly longer. It can hold 4 snowboards easy but I like being the nice guy who keeps all his friend's board safe."
2,doesnt work for me,"I have not been able to make this work, I am disappointed because it should have been exactly what I needed. Had to buy a keyed lock."
1,Failed After 2 Uses,"I would not recommend. Master should remove its name from this product. Being plastic, it feels very fragile. I imagine anyone could smash it with a hammer. The locking mechanism ceased to function after 2 uses."
5,AWESOME product!,"This is a fantastic product. LOVE it! This is the fourth one I've purchased, two for myself and then gifts for others. It's easy to use, easy to clean and the madelienes come out lovely :)"

1,Woefully lacking -- save your money,"I had used Norton before OSX with no problem but now, it simply causes more problems than it fixes. It is impossible to create a repair boot CD and place an up-to-date version of Norton on it. This means that users of OS 10.2.x will be in trouble. Customer support for this product is also very poor. In short, Norton is no longer the standard for system or disk repair. I am still uncertain how I will run a proper maintenance on my G4 under OSX, thus I still use OS9 for my serious work. If Apple is serious about OSX, they should do something to alleviate this serious problem. Otherwise who would want to run OSX?!!"
1,"May be great for Windows, but [not] for Macs","I'm a fan of Norton Systemworks, and I've used it with every PC I've owned for years. Having said that, I was hoping that this functionality and ease-of-use would be the same for my new 17"" Apple Powerbook G4. This is the newest Apple with 1Gig of Ram and all the upgrades. The Systemworks disk utilities won't run from the intalled version of the software, they must be run from the CD after you reboot using the CD as the startup disk....and guess what? You can't boot up from the CD if you're using the newest version of the Mac OS. You have to, believe it or not, create a separate disk partition or use an attached USB drive. I'm very disappointed, and I recommend users with new Macs look elsewhere for their disk utility program needs."
2,No custom install for OS X,"I bought this for my G4 running 10.2.4, hoping to install the antivirus software and just have the disk doctor, etc available should a disaster happen. Unfortunately, this is not an option. If you have OS X, you must do a full install of everything, including things like FileSaver, that have cause me grief in the past. I confirmed this with Symantec's customer support. Fortunately, Symantec will refund your money within 60 days of purchase."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought SystemWorks because I was new to the Mac and thought this package was a good buy because of the software that it included. I was wrong. None of the utilities worked well and it didn't work as advertized. Spring Cleaning (one of the utilities I thought would be useful) worked but it was an older version. To make matters worse, the rebate I was supposed to get came back stating that I didn't meet the deadline even though I sent it 2 months prior to the expiration date. I will never buy another Norton product!"
2,Frustrating and near useless,"This translation of Aristotle's Ethics is simply useless to the modern reader. Welldon's translation is archaic and his footnotes create more confusion than they resolve - some are almost entirely in Greek. The chapters are marked in the wrong places, making comparisons between translations or references in critical essays a chore to find. After getting to Book IV (again, re-reading after the Kindle version), I finally found a copy ofNicomachean Ethics: Aristotleat my library, which is a wonderful translation.I wasted a lot of time puzzling over the words in Welldon's translation. As I was re-re-reading the same books in Oswald's translation, light bulbs were going off in my head and Aristotle's meaning became more clear with less work. Perhaps this book was better received in the 20's, or whenever it was originally publish, but now it is so lacking in areté that one must wonder if it's still published to prove Aristotle's point on the relativity of goodness."
4,history of performance,This book is a very informative. Providing a comprehensive history of performance art. This book gave me information about performance that I never knew before. This book is for a class and I feel personally that this is a very good teaching tool. From Dada to the present it allows me as a performance artist to see what is there before and what is happening now and be even more informed of what my work is all about. This is a very good and informative book.
5,Exciting and moving western adventure.,"Bill Brooks' Law for Hire series is a delight filled with well drawn characters and settings. Pinkerton operative Teddy Blue is called for by Buffalo Bill Cody. Cody's planning another big hunting expidition, in hopes he can use the profits to fund another Wild West show.Suspicious, superstitious, still spooked by the recent murder of Wild Bill and ""Georgie"" Custer being slaughtered (these things happen in threes, see) and tired Cody feels he needs protection. Plus, someone did try to shoot him.Teddy Blue, fresh from springing a friend out of jail, takes on the assignment. It's dangerous as a mentally unstable man has decided on a whim to take out Cody, while the son of the warrior Yellow Hand escapes from his reservation school and seeks to elimnate his father's killer which he believes will help reclaim his true heritage.Exciting, lyrical and poignant."
3,Too few seeds,I was disappointed in how few seeds there were in this packet. If they had specified the number I would have bought more packets but it was too late in the season by the time I discovered how few there were.
4,Grandkids enjoy it,"I got it expressly for my 4 year old grandson because he is such a fan of Thomas the Tank Engine. The first few episodes, he really enjoyed. Now, he seems to have lost interest and the 22 month old grandson loves it. He enjoys the theme song the best, but it holds his attention throughout."
5,fantastic ring!,i love the moon and stars and this ring was perfect!sometimes gets caught on stuff though bc it is pointy.
4,Very Good Independent Film,Admittedly... I'm an Okie and watched the movie to see the local scenes. It seemed to start a little slow and the acting could have been better at times. It kills me to give any negative views of it because knowing that it was an independent film for a first time writer/director leaves you thinking - wow that was pretty darn good!As the movie progressed I found myself more drawn into it. Very well written and thought out. I was very surprised at how good the story was.
3,not to bad,well this album has some very good points i like the sons 1 cowboy 2 shame and best of all the hit gently when i listen to these jams i wish it was 1988 again not as good as their first two albums but its nice.
5,Linda Davis CD,"Love this cd. Linda Davis has an amazing voice. Best known for her duet with Reba on ""Does He love You""."
4,Linda Davis Major Label Debut,This was Linda's first major-label CD (Capital Nashville) from 1991 and it contains the following songs:1. In A Different Light2. Some Kinda Woman3. Three Way Tie4. From Him To Here5. If Your Greener Grass Turns Blue6. There's A Problem At The Office7. Knowin' We'll Never Know8. White Collar Man9. The Crash Of 2910. If I Could Only Be Like You
4,"Simply divine, dahling.","""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel"" is about three words: Life, Love, and Family. Although it took me a while to read this book, I enjoyed every minute I spent on it. It drags at points, but then it'll pick right up in pace and you won't be able to put it down. This book shows you how important your friends are, how to forgive your family, and how to understand people. I hope the movie is just as good. I recommend."
3,Too Much Ya-Ya,"I liked this book, but I didn't fall in love with it. I probably will not read it again. I was very involved with the family struggles and the emotional plight of the main character, but the whole Ya-Ya bit got on my nerves. In this book, you have a mess of grown people walking around calling themselves ""ya-yas"" and ""petites ya-ya's"". It just wasn't realistic and I actually found it annoying and somewhat pretentious. I would have liked the book much better without all the insane Ya-Ya jargon. The main character is extremely well-rounded and very real. I liked her a lot."
5,THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU SEE YOUR MOM AS A REAL PERSON,"I read this book in 2 days. I've never been so affected by a book. I wanted to actually step into the pages and be apart of the characters lives. Each sentence brought you closer to these people. Every character had such a unique sense of humor and distinct personality. You couldn't help but love each one, regardless of their obvious disfunction. You will laugh and, no matter how hard you try not to, you will cry. No person that reads this book could ever forget this family."
1,Ghastly,Who does it better? Almost any other Southern author I've read. And who had the bright idea of putting this author to reading her own book? It was torture.
4,What a good book!,"""Secrets....."" was hard for me to decipher at first. I didn't know what to make of the flip-flop of years between Sidda and Vivi. It was a bit hard to follow up until the middle. Then the book really takes off. All I can say is... I wish I had been with Necie, Caro, Teensy and Vivi the night they hit the local water tower. You go, girls! I liked Rebecca Wells style of writing so I think I will check out ""Little Alters Everywhere."""
5,We need more books like this!,"This is a bold, beautiful book. It goes where many books don'tdare go - women's friendship, mother-daughter, marriage, career,alcohol, raciscm; and all in one book! I had a hard time putting itdown. After two months I re-read it in one day. I laugh, I cry. And I gave it to all my girlfriends."
5,This book comes to life!,"I enjoyed this book so much! very single part of it jumped out at me. Rebecca Wells makes the story really come to life, so you feel like your there with Vivi or Sidda. The movie did not do justice to this wonderful book, though a good movie within itself, emotional parts were left out. So if your in the mood for a book that'll take you away from everyday life, I recommened this book."
5,excellent,i loved this book. it is not as good as the movie but the movie was one of the best chick flicks ever.the movie didnt leve allot out and it is one of my all time favorite movies. the book is odd very odd. i mean the mother daughter letters. read it and see the movie while your at it.
4,I liked it.,"I loved this book, I found it different from the movie and I am glad that I saw the movie first. Perhaps I liked the book because I liked the movie. I found the closeness and the forgiveness that the women have for each other inspiring. They were and are there for each other no matter what. They love each other with a love that rivals the love they have for the husbands. Moral of this story: we all have a story that few people know about, a story that shapes who we are and what we are. I would recommed this book"
4,One of my best reads in 2000,"This was truly one of my best reads in 2000. I'm a thirty something woman, and this book really touched me. I have two sisters and my mother is one of two sisters, and we have passed this on to one another and to other women we know as well. It is fabulous and I would highly recommend this to any age woman to read. I laughed. I cried. I felt a bond with the characters in this book.A must read."
2,Not for me,"I can see how some people would find this a good book. Unfortunately, I have not been lucky enough to find any solid frienships similar to the ones told about in this book. It almost made me depressed to read it."
3,A nice light read,"I thought this was a nice light read. I don't think it was was a five star book, though. It had a wonderful message about the relationship between mothers and daughters, but I thought the ending was a little cheesy. I really like Southern authors, so this book was chock full of Southernisms. I just finished reading a wonderful story entitled ""The Stone's Ripple Mission"" by a lesser known Southern author, and I found it to be a much better story about Southern relationships."
1,This is supposed to be good?,"I was so disappointed by this book. I kept hearing great things about it, but I couldn't even finish it. I got about 2/3 of the way through it and I couldn't take the torture anymore. Don't waste your time."
3,Potentially good plot & characters; poor execution,"If the Ya-Ya story were told from the beginning instead of jumping back and forth to Sidda and that contrived scrapbook thing, I might have been drawn in. One or two Ya-Ya episodes did move me and I wanted them to continue, but they were over too soon. I'm not worried about the alcohol and ""abuse"", all kinds of people and situations have occured over time and can be explored for depth and meaning. This book never really clicked because of the TV-style writing and contrived present-day situation."
5,A keeper!!,"A marvelous, lyrical book about families and friendships. Poetically written, insightful, thought-provoking, sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic. A book I'm giving to my best friends for Christmas."
3,Fun but not amazing.,"I think most of the people who had problems with this book took it too seriously. If you read it for fun and don't think about it too much, it is quite an enjoyable read. Some of the sap could have been edited, but overall I enjoyed the light, breezy writing style. It's a good summer book--read it at the beach or on an airplane."
2,Too shallow,"I enjoyed this book, and found myself caught up in the idea of the story, but I found the characters were too contrived and shallow. I couldn't really believe all the things that came out of their mouths. And to me, Sidda seemed like a 25 year old, not a woman approaching 40, immature."
5,This book is about southern women at their eccentric best,"I bought this book because the owner of the book store I frequent said that it was hillarious and she laughed the whole while she read it. I laughed as I read it,through my tears. The Ya Ya's were my mother and her three sisters.They had nicknames for each other and a secret language of words and phrases that only they knew the meaning of.Rebecca Wells has captured the essence of southern womanhod, with all of it's strenghts,goodness,eccentricties and faults."
4,"A hilarious, heartbreaking gumbo of generations","Rebecca Wells has captured perfectly what it has been like to grow up the feminist daughter of Southern belles who were feminists without knowing it. This novel made me laugh out loud in several places--and weep genuine tears in others. I not only saw myself in these women, but I saw my mother, my aunts and several other dear friends who grew up in the South, with its corsetlike strictures on what constituted a ""lady,"". Two generations of women finally had the gumption to be who they are come hell or high water. Wells' book helped me to understand my mother and myself, and to long for my own ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood."""
3,Vivi isn't so divine,"I gave this book three stars as it was an entertaining read and I enjoyed it - but when it ended all I could think of - was that it? The 'secrets' revealed were a disappointment - sure Vivi had some hardships in her life but I certainly didn't feel this was an 'explanation' for the cruel abuse of her children. She comes across as a self-centered, irresponsible drunk - for example does she ever think about how hard life must be for the black ladies whom she dumps her kids on at every possible opportunity - that they might rather be with their own families? The whole book tends to glamorise issues such as alcoholism and child abuse. Sidda is entitled to her anger and I found the Ya Yas attempt to sweep the whole thing under the carpet despicable. Vivi might have benefited from less adoring friends, who might have told her some home truths about her behaviour."
3,Equally enjoyable and annoying,"Oh, this book! The premise of ""girl power,"" the themes of female friendship and the mother/daughter bond ... it's an ambitious, good-hearted book. Sidda is entirely sympathetic and I enjoyed her journey. But the author put way too much effort into making Vivi into what Holly Golightly (a far more original, believable heroine) would call ""a wild thing,"" and the results are nowhere near as endearing. Ms. Wells created this supposedly vibrant Vivi at the expense of other characters. Teensy, Caro and Neice are never given the depth required to make their friendship genuinely moving. And Shep is almost invisible -- and not in the ""he left her alone with too much responsibility"" fashion that the author intends. He's merely a shadow of a character, with no real dimension. Still there's enough style, warmth and affection here to make me willing to pick up LITTLE ALTARS someday. (But not enough to make reading the sequal a priority.)"
5,Ya-Ya Yahoo!,"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood stole my heart within the first five minutes and kept me going back for more. Born and raised in the Mississippi Delta, I really enjoyed all the ""Southernisms"" which only true Southerners would pick up on. Witnessing the true sisterhood and precious relationship between the Ya-Yas will make you want to call up your girlfriends and schedule a reunion! It can make you want to return to those vivacious, spirited, carefree years and do it all over again the right way....the Ya-Ya way! Wells will send any reader into a fit of laughter and then into a fit of tears. This book reached out, grabbed my heart, and squeezed it until I read the last page and finally had to close it. I would recommend this read to anyone wanting to relive those animated days of childhood, remember all the craziness of being a teenager, and reminisce that transition from girl to woman. I can't say enough about it!"
4,The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"Rebecca Wells tale of four Southern women growing up in rural Louisanna starting in the 30's and reaching into the 90's is a powerful picture of women at their best and worst. The dynamics between these women and the world is a ride into every woman's fanatasies and nightmares. The central character, Sidda, the oldest daughter of one of the Ya-Yas, brings home all the emotions wrapped up between a mother and daughter. If you have ever had a best friend or been a mother or daughter this book will make you laugh and cry. All of these woman are true role-models because they are perfect and they are sinners. In a word they are human, in all their glory and horror. Undoubtedly one of the best books I have read in ages. It was a joy to find out at the end that Ms. Wells had written another book about these characters. I rushed right out and bought it too. Congrats to Ms. Wells for a charming, well rounded tale about women."
2,This book couldn't keep me interested.,Please! Enough with the gosh darn Ya Ya business. My eyes couldn't roll more. M-E-L-O-D-R-A-M-A
1,Extremely tedious,"This was my first Oprah selection, and I was so disappointed, I haven't tried another. Extremely slow moving, I kept waiting for it to get better, and found myself at the end completely dis-satisified. A co-worker mentioned she was struggling through, and I told her not to bother! I don't know what all the fuss is about the Ya-Yas."
1,extremely disappointing,"my sister and I read the Ya Yas, having seen all the great reviews. we both HATED it....boring people.... didn't care if they lived died or did anything else. the whole book screamed FILM SCRIPT to me and while this often doesn't matter (see the Horse Whisperer), this was a truly disappointing book. Pity as we were both looking forward to finding an interesting southern woman novelist, given we love that area of the States."
3,I'm glad I used my library card for this book.,"The author has talent and I liked her Southern style: descriptions of emotions, inner thoughts the characters are having & not telling the others, and the balmy bayou scene. Read this book for entertainment purposes only. The women portrayed here are shallow, drunks and unrealistic. That's why the friends laugh so much, they are ripped! I was glad I used my library card when choosing to read this book. It would not be worth buying, in my opinion...and I read a lot of books ladies, believe me. There are better ones out in print, such as: ""Deep End of the Ocean"", ""The Bean Trees"", ""Vinegar Hill"", or ""Lake Wobegon Stories"". Buy any of the above books and enjoy them, not this one...it's not a ""keeper"", although it was a fun read at times."
4,"It may be a ""bubble-gum read,"" but it's message is profound","This is a wonderful book to curl up with on a cold day, under a blanket (or on a hot day by the pool-- take your pick.) Rebecca Wells' great descriptive language will make you yearn for the summer days of your childhood, and go out with your girlfriends (and move to Louisiana.)"
5,"simply,the most satisfyingly nostalgic book I have ever read","I never wanted to put this down, even for a minute. I was always dying to know what Vivi and the girls would do next."
3,Very disappointing,"I didn't like any of the characters. Maybe that is a sign of a good writer to have that response from a reader? The women in this plot were all overly indulgent, self-centered, whiners and martyr. Particularly the grandmother and daughter. (Very hard to understand why the mother hated Vivi so much and yet catered to her and her friends so much.) I kept reading it hoping for redeeming improvement. If everyone was such good friends it seems help could have come forth much sooner. Reader in NoCA"
5,The best book a girl will ever read!,"As an 18 year old girl with an extremely close group of girlfriends, I felt every word that Wells wrote down. This is by far the best book I have ever read. I laughed at the beginning, and I cried at the end. I have never been so moved by a book in my life. Any female who does not read this book is making the worst mistake of her life."
2,VERY BORING,"I am very disappointed in this book. I have only gotten as far as the middle of the story and I cannot stand it anymore! This is the most boring story I have EVER read!There is no begining,no middle and certainly no end.I cannot wait to take it back!!"
2,"Reminds me faintly of Judith Krantz' book ""Scruples.""",But does this observation refer to the paperback copy or the hardcover edition?
4,Every woman who ever hated her family should read this!,"Its a great book that brings to light just how crazy we all get around our families. Of course there is good and bad in all relationships, sometimes we need someone to point out just how silly we all become."
1,Dreadful!,"This inane book could only be a bestseller in this age of ""self-help"" and psycho-babble. Just as one today may find a book she found intensely relevant in the 1960s and blush at its nonsensical character, this dusty volume will be one to retrieve thirty years hence ... and wonder what peculiar turn of mind made it seem an exposition of friendship, much less a humourous work."
4,Simply Divine,"It is magical to actually read about bayou and hear it, smell it and feel the hot, sticky Louisiana air. I thought that Wells was pretty good at creating those pictures, as far as characters go, I thought Vivis behavior was a bit too ""gala"" at the times for a small southern town. Sidda made me think for a second how come she didn't know how to love, and I'm still wondering,.... Images, pictures, sounds and conditions of the scenery were very well created. I think it is one of the better books that I read so far this year. Shouldn't I mention that this book is a National Bestseller?"
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I absolutely loved this book. After the first chapter I felt like I knew the characters, and like I was along for the ride through the fantastic childhood of the ya-yas. I laughed and cried out loud able to see the scenes so vividly in my mind. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for an emotion envoking book that you never want to end."
3,Let's hear more about the other Ya Yas!,"I thought this was an interesting book, but the most intriguing part of the story, the friendship between the four women, was hardly touched. I would have loved to hear more about how they all supported each other through the years, how they laughed, how they cried.One other thing - I could not understand why Vivi engendered such loyalty in these other Ya Yas. She certainly tried their patience!! I think I must have missed those qualities in the Vivi character. However, I thought the Lawander the Elephant anecdote was simply wonderful - oh that something that inspirational had happened to me as a child!..."
2,Not a fan.,I tried to stay focused while reading this book but just had a hard time. I was disconnected with the main character and couldn't get excited about this read. I completely lost interest and I'm only a few chapters from finishing. I don't think I'll finish anytime soon.
5,"Simply ""divine""","Divine Secrets was just that for me, nothin boring about it at all. It was at times hillarious, at times sad, but overall it gave me a feelin of ""knowing"" each one of these characters in a personal way, and I could feel the ya-ya spirit in them and in myself. This book brought back many memories for me, good and bad. Miss Wells shows that her characters are flawed, they are not perfect people by any means, in fact some are downright dysfunctional. These flaws just make them all the more real, and I dare say there are many who can relate to the Ya-Yas and their families. I found the colloquialisms endearing, and being from the South, I understood them. Being from similar family situations I understood the characters too, with all their flaws and their attributes. I for one cannot wait to read another installment of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Ms. Wells please give us one soon. Carol (Rastus) Mobile, Ala."
3,Mixed Reaction,"Fun, but just not as good as the other quirky southern women, mother-daughter come-to-terms-with-the-past novels that I've read."
5,what a great book,"it was an amazing story. and i think that it teaches that you have to let go of the past and move on with your life, else you'll be misrible.it made me long for the type of friendship the ya-yas have. i wanted to live my childhood over in the hope of finding friends like that."
1,One star for the cover...,"Actually, though I am Jewish and from Boston, I could relate to the first chapter of this book. I, too, came from a background where my mother had the same friends from kindergarten on up, and my mother was also not the friendliest of mommies, to put it mildly. However, I couldn't get past the cutsie-poo speech mannerisms of this book. I have some southern friends and I'm sure my Boston accent grates on their nerves; well, their dripping ""belle"" thing gets on mine. I think this must be a really fun book for certain women who live below the Mason-Dixon line. I, for one, will eschew it, y'all."
2,very poorly written,"I was excited about this book as I feel the subject of female friendship has not been well covered in books yet. Well, it still hasn't. This book annoyed me so much I couldn't keep my attention on it for longer than a few minutes at a time. The author does not know how to write a scene that lets us see how a character is feeling - instead, she tells us. It's like watching a movie where you'd have no idea what a person is feeling except for by the voice-over. And it's still not good enough. Half the time I had no idea why a person acted in a certain way, particularly Sidda."
2,You've GOT to be kidding...,"I realize that this book has gotten some rave reviews, but for the life of me I cannot see the point. Here we have a bunch of spoiled, rich, white dixie (ditsie) debs (and one rather unlikeable offspring) eating and DRINKING their way through this story. I did enjoy the descriptive prose regarding the ""sisters"" as young girls, but beyond that, I found the characters one dimensional, totally self-absorbed, and nobody I would want to know. Perennial alcholics do not, in my humble opinion, make the most appealing sorts."
2,Wasn't very pleased...,"I was really not impressed by this book. After reading both of them I think Little Altars Everywhere was MUCH better. Ya-Ya dragged on, and was sorta boring. There were some good parts though, like all the flashbacks of Vivi in her younger days, but Sidda just annoyed me in this book.Everything that is wrong in her life is instantly blamed on her mother. She may not of had the best childhood...but it wasn't awful, and Vivi is surley NOT the root of all her problems. It just gets old afetr a couple hundred pages of her whining and self-doubt. I definiatly recommend Little Alters, and if you want to know why Vivi is the way she is, then Ya-Ya as well, but it takes a lot to get there."
2,An Oprahfied Gone with the Magnolias,"This book didn't completely stink, but I swear I just wanted to kick that Sidda. She's such a lump of whiney misery. And what, does she have a reverse Oedipal complex? My opinion: She's just an excuse for the author to write in flashbacks. Just for the record, I'm not a Southerner and I didn't like Steel Magnolias. So if you did, take my word with a grain of salt."
1,"Yuck. I liked the movie, the book is SHALLOW.","First of all, don't read this book if you expect it to be ""clean."" It's not the worst out there, but it managed to shock me a couple times. Second, even if you can tolerate that, these are SHALLOW people. I got about half way through the book. I'm sure ""dramatic"" and ""inspiring"" things happen later, but so far...ick. Its full of over the top STEREOTYPED characters. Not only that, but the characters all think they are deep and wonderful people. I've never read a book where I felt author was judgmental about what made an interesting person. I probably enjoyed the movie so much because they cut all the garbage out and it had a great cast. I can't believe people liked these characters!"
1,Horrendous,"There appear to be people who love this book, but I'm not quite sure what sort of readers they are. I don't mean that as an insult, but I just wish that someone had warned me before I read this about how very wretched it is. If you love books and literature, please ignore your well-meaning friends and enthusiastic reviews and let this one pass you by. It is remarkably bad.If you DON'T buy books from the grocery store or DON'T take reading advice from talk-show hosts, you'll probably want to avoid this book. I wish I had."
1,I'm glad I bought this for 10 cents at a flea market,"I'm only on page 83 and I'm about to ditch the book.It's not engaging. I can't relate to the characters. Their ""adventures"" are trite. The way they relate to each other is not realistic. If the main character, Sidda, was as badly abused as she implies, there is no reason for her to idolize her mother the way she does. The plot is disjointed, jumping from Sidda's narration to the mother's memories, without any kind of clear transition.Furthermore, the French is just AWFUL. You'd think the author would check with a French speaker before she commits such errors as ""Comprendez-vous"" or ""les petites pauvres"" (when she means poor little ones, not little poor people) to print. Or at least the EDITOR should have checked!!!"
2,Uggh! What a mess...,"A friend from a book club suggested I read this one. Often, we love the same authors (Anita Shreve, Amy Tan, Kaye Gibbons, etc.) but every time I picked this one up it just didn't click for me. Well, I finally sat down to read it and I was so disappointed! I think this is one of the many recent books that have been ""hyped-up"" more than it deserves. It's a somewhat funny, mildly entertaining tale of several lazy, shallow, vain southern women and their daughters. The story primarily focuses on one of the daughters who is desperately lost and trying to find her way as an adult. I adore books about southern women (see Kaye Gibbons - wonderful writer!) and family, but I found this to be one-dimensional and extremely predictable. If you must read it, go to the library - don't bother to buy. And, plan to read it while on vacation or better yet, while drinking heavily! Maybe if I had been drunk, I would have liked it too..."
2,Could not get into this one,"I had high hopes for this book when I started, but after 75 pages put it down to go on to something better ( so many books, so little time). It just was not my style of writing I guess...I just found so much of the conversation the ya-ya's had as young kids, well unbelievable. So contrived."
2,Disappointing,"Word of mouth on this book was so strong that I had to pick it up. Having grown up and lived in the South my whole life, I was ready for a really good read. Boy, was I disappointed. The book seems more like disjointed short stories featuring the same characters than anything else. The plot lines veer toward melodrama and stereotype and I found myself reading with growing impatience and annoyance. Bottom line: I do not recommend this book to any of my friends. If you want really good writing about the women of the South, read Ellen Gilchrist."
2,Throw away characters in a throw away book,"Clearly written in the hopes that Hollywood would pick this up. Its full of fantastic, larger-than-life characters. Of maybe soemthing Lifetime Television (for Women, you know) would dramatize."
2,YaYa no.,"I read this book beacause of my book group, which I think is the only reason I finished it. First of all I think it's way too long. There are too many passages when I sit there ""okey okey move on"" and get bored. The story could be interesting, a difficult mother and a daughter relationship, but after we get that, it takes forever for something new to happen. Do we really have to know of every single party the YaYa girls go to? Second, it's always boring when you realise that the good people will always be good (and the good people in this book, they certainly are oh-so-good) and the bad people will be bad. No development whatsoever, and therefore no excitement. So, even though I value longlasting friendship and all of that, this book did not make me want to join the YaYa-clubs."
1,I really don't know what to make of this book,"I read this book and it had no effect on me what-so-ever. I expected much more depth from Wells' characters. Because it is told as a series of flashbacks, the reader is only given thin facades of each character. None of Wells' characters seemed to possess a soul. I think Wells' intended message was that even though Siddalee endured so much abuse as a child, she realized that her mother loved her, and did her very best. A message often hard-learned, but after reading 356 pages, I expected much more depth, breadth, and a greater understanding for my own life experience and journey."
1,"Banal, trite, self-indulgent, liberal feminist nonsense.","I finished this book because it was the only one I brought on the plane and the film was ""Lost in Space"".I have never read such a cliched, predictable and tedious book. I thought the writing was sophomoric and dull. It read like the author had written the story and then picked up a thesaurus and started changing words at random to make the piece read ""more intelligently"". What I wouldn't give for a book where people walked across a floor instead of ""padded""."
1,overwrought and wrong,"I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about, so I bought and read both this and LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE. Ugh. Aside frome the fact that the details are often WRONG (""crayfish""? OYSTER muffulettas?), it's overwrought, overheated, the framing story is moronic.... How can you caonize a mother who is an alcoholic child-beating sexual abuser? Why would you want friends like the equally alcoholic and shallow Ya-Yas? As a friend of mine said, ""All of the women who love this book are people I cannot stand."""
4,Emotional relationship of friendship and mother-daughter exp,Recently joined a book club and Divine Secrets of Ya Ya Sisterhood was our first selection. I was interested in anyone else's feedback or comments regarding this selection.
2,wildly overrated and a disappointing read,"This book was absolutely raved about (as you can see from the amazon reader reviews), but utterly failed to charm me. The writing style was too flowery, too obviously trying evoke.As for the content, I find it impossible to believe that a woman (Vivi) with THAT close of friendships could be THAT screwed up and unable to pass even a facsimile of that love to her own children. The trials and heartbreak she suffered as an adolescent seemed no worse those of most people. (I could be confusing this book with that horrible, horrid, awful prequel ""Little Alters."")"
2,Didn't even want to finish,I had heard good things about this book so I got it. I read into it about halfway and just couldn't take anymore. It wasn't holding my interest. I found it quite boring.
2,NOT GA-GA OVER YA-YA,"Large portions of this book were either unbelievable, trite, or downright annoying. For examples, leaf through the book for any mention of the dog, Hueylene. All of the ""dog"" passages reminded me of the stuff I used to put in term papers so that I could meet the minimum length requirement.There were some cute little stories stashed here and there, but all in all, I'd have to say that this is the most overrated book I've read since Memoirs of A Geisha."
2,one word: contrived,"I'm not quite done with this book yet, but I felt like writing a review anyway. I like the flashbacks with the stories about the Ya-Yas' childhood and Sidda's childhood, but this whole scrapbook thing has got to be the most contrived way to get to these flashbacks that I could ever imagine. I find myself skimming over the parts in the present, with Sidda at the cabin, because they just seem like filler the author put in to get us from one flashback to the next. I thought I would race through this book, but instead I'm crawling through it, because each time I get to a ""Sidda"" part, I just get fed up with her silliness and bored with her thoughts. I haven't given up on ""Divine Secrets"" yet, but it's certainly slow going."
5,"Fabulous, Dahlin'!","What a divine and delicious way to spend a few days! I loved the elephant/Lawanda scene where Sidda finds a memory through a ""lost"" key. A nice balance of the horrible with the beautiful. This and ""Little Altars"" are sister books to Michael Lee West's ""Crazy Ladies"". The characters come to life in these books."
3,Better than average escape literature with great stories,"I am enjoying reading this book, mostly from the point of view of the daughter, Sidda. After reading ""Little Altars"" I am not crazy about the mother character, Vivi, but I suspend my dislike of her in order to find out, with Sidda, what made her click. I am most impressed with the author's writing ability. She is a great storyteller in the flashbacks, vignettes, etc. that make up most of the book. The way Ms. Wells moves so skillfully and effortlessly back and forth between past, present, recent past, etc., and between the two main characters, is awesome.As some other reviewers mentioned, I find the title silly-- this put me off from reading the book for a long time. I also find the character names rather ridiculous and a bit irritating-- why can't they have regular names, but then this may be a bit of the Louisiana culture that I am not familiar with. The good of this book far outweighs the bad."
1,NOT IMPRESSED,"After about a month, I finally managed to finish this book. If you want to read about a bunch of selfish, alcoholic nudist, then this is the book for you. If you want to read something worth reading, try Michael Lee West."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I'm thankful for all the readers who expressed a similar opinion, because I was the lone one who despised this book at my book club! I am glad I am not the only one who finds the characters trite, selfish and uninteresting!"
5,An exceptional tale of female bonding,"This book is absolutely one of the best I've ever read. I was recovering from surgery and engrossed in self-pity when I started it, but by the end I had come to terms with my illness. As Vivi would say, ""Life is scary, you just have to get on the beast and ride!"" It made me appreciate my own group of Ya-Ya's even more."
4,good if you're not annoyed easily,"I, like many others I know, found the book to be hysterically funny at times--and downright annoying at others. I relished the stories of Vivi and her friends, but when it came to the ""current day"" parts, I found myself wanting to skip over most of the paragraphs (with exception of the mentions of the dog). Sida was so cloyingly obnoxious that I found myself wishing her ill. I was disappointed that such a strong woman as Vivi would have such a simpering daughter. I hope the same does not happen to me!"
5,Ya-Ya's are food for the soul!,"I kept the book on my nightstand for weeks before reading it -- afraid that the contents may be too ""trendy"" or ""deep"" for my tastes. How shocked I was to discover that the Ya-Ya's are the very embodiment of the crazy lifelong friendships that exist between Southern women. A little dash of insanity, and a big scoop of impetuousness -- all mixed into the lovely confection we call sisterhood. PERFECT soul food for those of us lucky enough to have the lifelong friendships of our own groups of special women! BRAVO, Ms. Wells, you've represented us well!!!!"
4,Great Stories But Lacks OrganizationSLC,I enjoyed the stories in this book but they seemed thrown together. Half are told in third person and the other half in first person. I liked the flashbacks but it alternated to frequently. Other than that - a great book! I laughed out loud during the Shirley Temple scene...I will never forget Pooty Pootwell! And Vivi's experience at St. Augustine's just about broke my heart. If you enjoyed this book you would love Beach Music by Pat Conroy (one of my all time favorites).
2,Some interesting characters lost in an implausible framework,"While the relationships of the first generation of Ya-Yas made for some good reading, the framing story of the oldest daughter of the most outrageous Ya-Ya was trite, boring, and, as a result, a little intrusive. Wells was a little lazy in her characterizations (for all their brass and sass, the Ya-Yas do not have distinctive voices), and she completely failed to engage me in the story of the adult daughter. The ""Gone With the Wind"" episode was memorable, as were a handful of others, but the overall effect was severely handicapped by Wells's sloppiness as a writer. These poor women never seemed real to me, and, in the end, the point of the story (the daughter's redemption) looked a little too self-serving for comfort."
1,I couldn't force myself to finish this book.,I can't imagine what all of the hype is about. What one-dimensional characters and absurd writing -- I couldn't help laughing out loud during passages that were intended to be serious and emotionally powerful.
4,One can't escape the effects of one's parents.,"This book gave me hope. We all seem to have issues with our parents and the ways we are raised. Life is a process of evolution. We learn as we grow and we come to understand the reasons behind our parents' actions. Many of us find support from the unconditional love of friends. They love us no matter what our flaws are. This book made me wish I had a ya-ya sisterhood. To love me in spite of myself. And it made me wish that in raising my own child, I don't make the same mistakes my parents did. That's how we evolve as humans. We'll still make mistakes but hopefully we continue to evolve."
3,A compelling portrait of alcoholism,"Ya Ya has inspired a look at active alcoholism and it's affects on the family in a way which readers may find uncomfortable and reassuring. The codependent relationships are vividly portrayed in the loving bonds and enmeshing ego. The crippling of the children, emotionally, is developed beautifully from the first book, Little Alters Everywhere."
5,"Thank you, reviewers...","I punched in five stars because the reviews of this book are hilarious and I want to thank you all - and I do mean ""you-all."" I am about to read this book and I can hardly wait to see if I love it or hate it! I loved the review that said, simply ""This too shall pass."" On the other hand, I can see that it really moved many women, and I look forward to the experience, whatever it will be. When I am finished with this extraordinarily controversial book, I will write a full review."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't love it either. I picked this book up on recommendations from a wide variety of people, but I was quite disappointed with it. Personally I found the characters just too colourful to be real. And as a mother myself I had a hard time identifying with a character that is a selfish immature poor excuse for a mother. There is just no excuse for abuse - even if you are a Ya-Ya."
3,"not great, but not bad either","The Ya-Ya's are a semi-interesting lot. Ironically, the lead characters in the book, Vivi and her daughter, Sidda, are the least interesting of the whole bunch. I would have liked to have gotten to know any of the other Ya-Yas better. Ok, it passed the time on the plane but not the most memorable book either."
1,I would...,I WOULD GIVE THIS A ZERO BUT THEY WON'T LET ME. AND I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO READ THE BOOK TO KNOW IT!!!
1,Capital O for Overrated,"This book is not badly written. It simply has no plot and I can easily place it in my top ten Most Boring Books list. Perhaps I am a bit biased since everyone I knew raved about this book and it was strongly recommended to me by several people. I was bound to be disappointed I suppose and hence should not blame a fairly good writer. I know that others will vehemently disagree with me but I have to ask.....what is the big deal about this book? Why, when there are so many other interesting novels out there, would you pick up this bland concoction. Sure, the mother-daughter conflict makes for interesting fiction otherwise it would not be done so often in literature. If you want to read real mother-daughter drama, read White Oleander. I don't understand what is so compelling about this group of four women who grow old together. It really reminded me of Steel Magnolias which does nothing for its credibility."
3,Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,I found this book to be very boring. I did not care for the characters and felt the stories within the story to be extremely long-winded & unrealistic. A big dissapointment.
3,I felt like I stepped back in time.,"I cried and cried mostly because this book brought back memories (better left repressed)and dragged up old scars. Never before has a writer made me feel THAT emotional. I kept reading it feeling as though I was reading my autobiography. Being a southerner has nothing to do with it as my mother and I are born and bred die hard New Yorkers! For me it was realism and if anyone thinks this was contrived, she had better wake up! I'm only giving it 3 stars BECAUSE the memories evoked were too sad for me to recommend it; however, the writing is definitely superior to much I've read recently."
4,Hearty humour and impassioned characters,"Though not neccesarily divine, this sorority read engages with a dosage of irreverent fun and adventure - and probes deep inside to explore the psyche of a mother-and-daughter relationship gone awry. Sidda Walker, overwhelmed by her theatrical success is forced to evaluate happiness and kinship when a marriage proposal from her colleague Conner arrives. Vivi Walker under her daughter's ardent persuasion sends her a book that records the memories and secrets of the Ya-Ya sisterhood. The circle of friends including Necie, Caro and Teensy will charm you with their individual charms. This book however is more evocative on its insights to personal experiences and growth - understanding heartaches and emotional traumas. The poignancy of Vivi's torment with her motherhood and problems lends an emotional core to the energetic story. Rebecca Wells pens the story with heart and humour - and ultimately beautiful characters residing in the town of Louisiana."
5,Keeps you laughing ...,"I haven't seen the movie, but the book is great. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I became more and more intrigued with the characters, and wanted to know what would happen next before I put the book down! A light, funny, and touching read."
4,Great Summer Reading,"Divine secrets of the Ya Ya sisterhood is a great read. It is such a cliche, but I laughed and I cried while reading this book. At times it is overwrought, but the flashbacks to the Ya Ya's early years make Sidda's wordy internal dialogues easy to take. Anyone who is a daughter, a sister, a mother, a godmother, or a friend to another woman will relate to this book."
4,A Good Read? Ya-Ya!,"This book is just a good read, plain and simple! A fair warning to anyone who picks up this book: it'll make you miss your girlfriends."
4,a story of women friendships and mother/daughter relationshi,"I have read divine secrets 3 times already and each time I discover something new. This is a good story of women's friendships, their sorrows and tribulations. It is also a story of that wierd and special relationship that exists between mother and daughter and how we never really are able to know the woman behind the mother. Siddalee is given that chance when she receives her mother's secret scrapbook detailing her life and friendships with the Ys-Yas. She becomes privey to that special relationship that exists between women that no man is allowed to penetrate: the sorrows, the joys, the ups the downs that are part of a woman's life. This book is wonderful - a must read for all women of all ages."
2,I was surprised by this book,"Instead of loving the Ya-Yas, I was surprised by how much I disliked this book. Wells can get specific vignettes just right: a small-town contest that falls into disarray, or girls out on the sleeping-porch on a hot summer night, are wonderfully drawn.The framework for these vignettes is a problem, though: how can a person's, Vivi's, memories be invoked in her daughter when that daughter simply holds a memento from Vivi's scrapbook? Some divine or magical agency? ESP? Who knows? A loving group of women who help their friend's daughter understand her mother better by *telling* her stories would be more mundane, but also more credible and involving.That may be a problem that only I have with the book, but why spend leisure time on a character who is as completely toxic as Vivi? I recommend it if it rains on your vacation and it's the only book you've got."
2,"Like having to read a novel version of the sitcom ""Alice""","I haven't read the other 300 reviews in here, but I found this book very hard to get through. Wells wants her adult Sidda to be screwed up, but she can't seem to escape the romance novel convention that says heroines have to be glamorously screwed-up, i.e. confused despite fabulous careers and dark, handsome, beautifully one-dimensional boyfriends. I was quickly bored with Sidda's problems.I hate Southern novels that are infused with a yee haw sensibility that feels close to Petticoat Junction than Faulkner, and this book is rife with moments of teeth-clenching cutsie-pie.Not my cup of molasses."
1,The NY Times Book Review was right not to feature Ya Yas,"Since the book was given to me as a gift, I can only be grateful I didn't put out my hard earned money for a copy. To compare the characters in this novel with the characters in Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind"" - or any of Flannery O'Connors short stories - would be ludicrous. The Ya Yas were characters who never changed and they all were interchangeable. This novel has been compared to ""The Bridges of Madison County."" While I think it is a valid comparison, ""Bridges"" was intended by the author to be a ""spoof"" although, ironically, it was not received that way. Evidently ""literary"" history repeats itself. Worst of all, this book is boring. I am only half through it, but I keep it on my bedside table at night and after a page or two, I am sound asleep. At this rate, I should finish it by the millenium."
2,Nothing divine. Yawn-yawn.,"This book is a verbose, homoerotic, waste of time. And the great conflict between mother and daughter was just plain unbelievable; there was no pay-off after all that slugging through. Don't bother."
1,The Worst Book I Read This Year,"I was looking forward to reading this book. What a disappointment! I had to force myself to finish. Aside from the ""whine"" factor going through the roof, the sugar coating was just too much. ""Fluffy pink and blue thoughts."" The ridiculous 84,000 blessings. I defy you to turn to any random page and NOT come up with something gooey and cliched. This is the stuff of seriously bad Young Adult books. Ms. Wells might be a lucky writer, but she certainly isn't a gifted one."
2,What a Stupid Book!,"I can't believe I paid money for this book. The characters had no depth to them at all. For the most part, they were stereotypes. This is a feeble attempt at a ""feminist"" book. As a woman, I am insulted by this book and the supposed ""sisterhood"" it portrays."
5,Excellent book about relationships!,"This book will pack an emotional punch and make you re-evaluate those parent/child relationships that you may have severed or estranged. This book digs into the characters' past and experiences to explain how they affect their relationships with their families.At first, you may make choices of whom you believe to be the good persona nd the bad person ubtil you read about the troubled childhood of the characters. The book isn't sappy by working on sympathy. It's almost true to life, especially to those who have experienced abuse or loss.Along with drama, there is also a lot of humor in the stories told. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You won't regret reading this book. Read and find out the Divine Secrets!"
4,I devoured this book...,"I read the Divine Ya-Ya's before I read her first novel, Little Alters Everywhere. Little Alters is more about Viv's children, husband, and servants than it is about the Ya-Ya's. I got to know the Ya-Ya's in the second book and missed them terribly in Little Alters.The thing about the Divine Ya-Ya's book I did not care for was all the whining that Sidda did about her mother. You could tell right away Viv had a disfunctional past and this is what effected her present life. But her daughter was wollerin' in self pity through out the book..I enjoyed that fact that these women were at home with their children, or away with them during the summer for a month at a time. I remember when that was the norm. You would think there would be more disfunction out there now, with mothers & fathers both working, than you could have dug up during this book."
3,Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"Although the book started out rather slow, I stayed with it because a friend highly recommended it. It definitely got better with each passing chapter. Growing up as a military brat, moving every 3 years or so, I found myself envying the special bond between the ya-yas. I especially related to the relationship between mother and daughter, from beginning to end!"
4,this delightful story touched the depths of my heart.,the ya-ya sisters was a spunky book that revealed to many (including me) how exciting it is to belong to a group of people. -poop
4,I saw parts of my own life in the lives of the sisterhood.,"I laughed, cried, pondered, and couldn't put the book down. It's like a wonderful box of chocolates, it went too fast and shortly after I was finished I wanted more."
5,I want. . .NO. . I NEED more! More! More!,"A brilliantly funny and touching novel, the only problem with it is that not enough MEN will read it."
1,"Though I found the book entertaining, I was disappointed","after hearing so many rave reviews. Not only was I irritated by all the self absorbtion, the whole thing was just too cute, too predictable. The story was a good idea, but lacked depth."
1,here's a grip - get it,"My sister sent me this book, saying it was un-put downable. Fine. I read it - and have wondered why I did so. Shallow, predictable characters, who have no, repeat NO toehold in real life. I rather think that we are supposed to identify with either Siddalee or Vivi, or view one of them as our sister/mother. Hmmph. I can identify well with women who have never had to work outside the home, who have no money worries, and were sent to film premieres; I know several women who can leave their high-end jobs in the theatre to go to an island and think about their lives. Drivel - possibly well-intentioned, possibly cathartic to Wells, but drivel nonetheless."
3,I don't know people like these . . . thank heavens!,"This book was a disappointment, however it improved somewhat as I progressed through it. These are some of the most vain, selfish people that Wells could apparently illustrate; I'm glad I do not have this many disfunctional people in my life! (It would drive me to a breakdown, too!)The most striking part of this book was the poor parenting and lack of nurture that these women were providing to their children early in their lives. Granted, they had their problems - non-communicative, domineering or absentee husbands - but I pitied them! Isn't it interesting how our greatest weaknesses tend to get passed on to our children?! This certainly shows the same! Rent it, don't buy this one."
4,"Ya, Ya, I liked this one!","A refreshing look at making the most of life, set in the deep south. I felt myself unwinding and settling in the lives of the outgoing Ya Yas. Every family has their ugly secrets, but the Divine Secrets encourages forgiveness and renewal. Our book club is excited to chat about this one. We're going to cook up some spicy Gumbo Ya Ya, play cards and delve into Vivi and Sidda's past."
1,"Slow, boring, mean","I did not enjoy this book. It was a slow boring read. Vivi is a mean selfish woman as is her daughter. I was really looking forward to reading this book. It was recommended by so many of my friends. I was extremely disappointed. I didn't care how the book ended and didn't even care to finish it, but I pushed through to the end. It never got better."
2,"Boring, cliched, trite, disturbing.","I found this to be an obnoxious, poorly written book. Wells draws on every cliche possible. The characters are so false that I couldn't believe that other readers actually identify with them. I read this book after Little Alters Everywhere and I thought that this book was particularly weird after the sexual, psychological, and physical abuse in the first book. Why is this character idolized by the members of Ya Ya societies everywhere?"
4,A revelation about my mother's life,"I resisted reading ""Divine Secrets"" for several months even though it was recommended by a friend whose opinion I respect. I thought the title was silly (still do) and I didn't like the cover (still don't). But -- the book itself really grew on me and the most important thing about it was that it made me re-examine how I thought about my own mother, who, by the way, is nothing like any of the Ya-Yas. It is so hard to access someone else's experiences and memories; the book helped me to understand some things about my own mother just because she grew up in the same era as the Ya Yas, and for that I am thankful. It also made me wonder--why do we so often seem to have unresolved conflicts with our parents?"
2,Shallow characters and an alcoholic storyline.,"I recently read an article reviewing ""A Monk Swimming"", which praised the happily drunk main character and his antics, but warned that people who had alcoholics in their circle of family or friends would not find this story amusing. ""Ya-yas"" is another such book. It is painful to see Vivi and her ya-ya friends soaking up hard liquor as the children play and swim around them, or pack a cooler of Bloody Marys while they hop in the car and get drunk on the road. Anyone who knows the tragedy alcoholics face in their daily life will not find this glorification of such activities very charming at all."
2,Disappointing,"The title is catchy, but the book is woefully disappointing. Contrary to the reviews on the cover, it really was not particularly funny. It read more like a motion picture script than a novel."
2,"A novel ""lite""?","I'll admit to being entertained at some of the young YaYas' exploits, and occasionally touched at the devotion that they had for each other. However, the characters (particularly the men), plot, and dialogue were contrived and stilted. I won't bother to read Little Altars!"
3,"A good story, but don't expect depth","I enjoyed this book and finished it in a couple days, but now I wonder if I just wanted to get to the end of the book. Vivi's story is what kept me reading; she was probably the most complex character in the entire book. Sidda was just a bit too precious and ever so damaged. Her story was too predictable and Hollywood. I was annoyed the way Wells portrayed the book ""On the Way to the Wedding"" as a marriage primer (which it is not) in the context of the story. After reading ""Little Altars"", I was disappointed. Big Shep was like a decoration in this book and Aunt Jezzie, who figured prominently in Sidda's childhood, was noticably absent. The ending was pure treacle. It's worth reading only if you enjoyed Little Altars."
2,"A maudlin, overwritten tribute to white southern womanhood.","I picked up this novel because stories about mothers who lose it after the fourth or fifth child generally interest me, but I couldn't stomach the dose of sentimental drivel about the true (and therefore typically southern) friendship exemplified by that bunch of spoiled, rich, white belles. At least those passages are better written than the framing story about the protagonist putting off her marriage and planning to directing ""The Women."" Those sections are completely overwritten and even more nauseating, with their Harlequin Romance-like references to ""his strong arms,"" etc. Why didn't Wells's editor at least tell her to cut that part?"
4,Great book but a few problems.,"I loved the book The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhoodbut there was one inconsistency that was like a thorn in my sidethroughout the book...Oh well, these things happen but I wish someone would have had caught these mistakes before it was printed. Then it would have been a perfect book. I am looking forward to reading Little Altars Everywhere."
1,I found this book inane.,"I normally like southern women writers, but this left me cold. I found this book contrived, silly and a total waste of time."
5,"Truly, one of the best novels I have ever read!","Rebecca Wells has managed to capture the essence of the intense bond of girl friends as well as the peaks and valleys relationship of mothers and daughters. No one book has ever held me so spell bound that, I didn't just read it twice myself, but have bought it over and over again because I can't bare for my friends and family to have not read it. I laughed until I cried, then, the very next chapter I would sob at the bitter-sweet truths in Ms. Wells novel. I have been a YaYa Sister for years and never knew we had a name until I read this novel. You must read it!!!"
1,OVERATED!,With all the 'glowing' reviews this book received I couldn't wait to pick it up (the cover itself is reason enough to buy this book!) and read it. Talk about a disappointment! I could not get into Wells' style of writing and lack of character development. I found myself having no sense of feeling for the main characters and had to force myself to read this book - finally quit after 224 pages. Very disappointing.
4,Great book...but not authentic,"I loved this book, and its characters, but being a native of Louisiana and a graduate of LSU, I couldn't help but be confused by Wells' inaccuracies. ""Crayfish???"" Only Yankees say crayfish, any native Louisianian knows it's a crawfish. She's also got her New Orleans sandwiches confused-- there may be oyster po-boys, but I don't think I've ever seen an oyster muffaletta. I don't expect Ms. Wells to have a perfect memory, but if you remember anything about Louisiana, it should be the food!!"
2,Not as good as Altars,"If you stand back and check the scenes, one by one, they were preposterous. Except readers want to believe and therefore ""work with"" the author and forget the details that make it so unrealistic. I think the people who like this book must have coming of age issues in their forties that most people took care of in their twenties. The characters in the first book were much more developed. Wells's first book illuminated the consequences of the period's politics on a family in specifically too. It was funnier and sadder and darker and even more psychological."
5,Transports you straight to Louisiana,"The mere number of reviews on this books shows how powerful it is. I reccomend this to anyone who loves a good, honest, deep, read. It will make you laugh out loud and cry. It would be fun to be a Ya Ya for a day. (But not the morning after!) If you are interested in this book, read ""Little Altars Everywhere"" first; although it sold fewer copies, it is equally fabulous and is the first in the series."
5,Growing up Southern...,"The South is oft hard to capture in the pages of a book... yet Rebecca Wells catches the South easily with her writing and hands it to us to peruse, dream of, and encounter. Sidda is a three-dimensional woman who is attempting to understand herself through her past. The gentle stoning of past familial injuries are laid bare in this book for all to judge. Yet, we find, as does Sidda, that we don't want to judge... we simply want to take our gifts from the book...painfully wrapped though they may be. I found myself walking down old childhood roads when I read this book...the South is a world unto itself and ""Divine Secrets.."" is also a world unto itself... Fix some iced tea, play some Tanya Tucker, and read this book... I only wish it had been longer because I was sad to leave the bright world of the ya-ya's."
1,Tedious and boring.,"Terrible read. Three-quarters of the way through the book I was still waiting to find a single character that I cared about. By the end, I wished I hadn't wasted my time with this book."
1,And what is the big deal with yaya?,"How does skinny dipping cause such a stir? A completely unbelievable family relationship, poor monolouge."
2,"Readable, but just barely.","Parts of this story are entertaining, but the last five chapters are pure sentimental drivel, as are passages throughout the book. The 4 yayas are exactly the type of girls/women I've always detested--they think they're something special, when what they really are is obnoxous and thoroughly self-absorbed."
5,This book riveted me and made me laugh and cry.,In order to grasp what the Ya-Ya's are all about you have to read this book. Many of us have had our own Ya-Ya's and never knew it. My sister gave me the book for Christmas. She is my Ya-Ya. It moved between laughter and tears many times. A must read for women and men!
1,Not at all what I thought It Would be cut out to Be,"I just got to get this out of my system: This Book Sucked! I absolutely hated the way it was written, bouncing around, back and forth, not at all connecting with what the story was meant to be. Another thing: the characters were unbelieveablely grossly American. Your typical immigrant from the early 1700s. Housewives with rats for kids may enjoy this book, but as for me, the single female, did not find this novel humerous or interesting at all."
5,few books have the power to make me laugh and cry so hard,"this is a wonderful book that touched me deeply. not many books make you feel that you are actualy experiencing the sorrow and joy of relationships between mother and daughters, and between best friends"
5,This book affected me in a way that will never leave me.,"When I picked up this book, its dynamic words jumped right off the page and into my startled, open mind. From the very beginning, Wells gives the feeling both of difficult, difficult conflict and of serenity that is washing through the mind of Siddalee Walker. Her emotions-both Wells' and Siddalee's-seem to spiral into the inner heart of the reader, making this one of the best books I've ever read. More importantly, though, is the way Wells blends the stories of Sidda, at 40, and the turmoil in her life, with the happy-go-lucky days of her mother and her three best friends. Wells' women are strong, and highly beautiful. This feeling eminates from the stories like rays of light from the sun. All in all, Wells has broken the barrier between being an excellent writer and being a star."
4,"Meaningful and poignant, it opened personal doors.","This very sensitive book, colorful and sensual, made me want to take a trip to Louisiana. I could smell the jasmine and taste the lemonade! I wanted to know the Ya Ya's, but do I want to be one? I'd rather be one of their children. This excellent novel certainly made me analyze my own childhood and the ways my family relationships molded me. I intend to send copies to my own daughters."
4,Liked the book a lot. Easy read!,There was a lot of comedy in the book and a lot of psycological undertows. I found the Mother daughter relationship between Vivi and Sidda more compelling than the yayas and the sisterhood.
1,boring....,"I know so many people loved this book but I simply could not get into it. I was forcing myself to read it. I was waiting for the story to start after the first few chapters, but it never did."
4,Strong themes propel this mother-daughter reconciliation,"We are who we are as a result of a sum of our experiences and principally because of WHO raised us are strong recurring thoughts in Wells' DIVINE SECRETS. Coupled with the love, loyalty and wisdom shared by close women friends, SECRETS successfully communicates the notion that true love is indeed unconditional and doesn't seek to understand, but merely accepts. Above all, my lasting impression of this book is that life may be short, but it's as W-I-D-E as you want to make it. A good investment of your time."
1,"Southern, but not Siddalee","Want to read a truly fabulous book about disfunctional, Catholic families from Louisianna? Want a really hysterically funny read rich with N'awlins patois, a boozy mother, and a character whose life is made up of a bunch of wild and crazy adventures? Let me recommend ""A Confederacy Of Dunces"". This, however, is a waste of paper."
3,"Some good moments, but lacking depth in key characters","I found the overall premise of the book engaging, but found the character of Sidda lacking much depth and I could not understand why she lacked the ability to love or have female relationships, which was the main thrust of the book. The Ya Ya sisters were much more intriguing. The very end with Sidda and her fiance reminded me of a Harlequin romance, a disappointment after some complex relationships were uncovered earlier in the book."
3,Don't Stop With Wells--Read On!,"If you like the ya-ya's,which is so-so, you will LOVE these wonderful Louisiana authors:Michael Lee West--SHE FLEW THE COOP: A NOVEL CONCERNING LIFE, DEATH, SEX, AND RECIPESJohn Dufresne--LOUISIANA POWER AND LIGHTShelia Bosworth--ALMOST INNOCENT"
4,"Highly entertaining, really made me think","I enjoyed this book - the first book chosen for our book club. The southern imagery was entertaining and full of imagination. I thought the characters were explored well, except I could never get a clear picture in my head of the faces of the Ya-Ya's. More could have been done with the relationship of Sidda and her fiancee. The fairy-tale ending was much-needed, but also a little predictable. A good read for anyone interested in female relationships!"
5,The complex relationships between mothers and daughters,"I was a wee bit leary at first to delve into a book that dealt with the complex relationships between mothers and daughters, but upon reading it I now realize that there is no perfect answer to all of the mysteries that remain between a mother and her eldest daughter. I have often tried to deal with this relationship and have now come to a new understanding and respect for something I can not control. This was one of the most beautiful books I have ever read and know that I will re-read it for years to come and will definately recommend it to anyone (especially daughters) to read!"
3,More a 3 and a half rating.,"Either you love or hate this read and I only liked it. I think it was over-rated and over-hyped. I enjoyed the overall read, but some chapters made me go right to sleep and dragged on to the point that I was reading just to get through and finish. Half of the chapters in this book are worth reading. The funnest part are the sultry descriptions of the south, childhood descriptions and bits and pieces of Lousiana. I laughed and rolled my eyes alot while reading this story. The Ya-Yas were fluffy and so full of themselves. I know REAL people whose lives are more substantial and interesting than the Ya-Ya's. Worth the read to later bag on it. Don't buy, but borrow this book."
5,Best damn book I've read in a month of Sundays!,"Y'all don't have to be from the South to love this book, Dahlin', but it might help y'all to understand the dialect in which it is written. Being from the Gret Stet of Missippi (yep that's how we say it 'round heah), I have traveled to Loosiana many times and have known people, both men and women, just like the ones in the book. This book is very Southern and deeply steeped in the bourbon, branchwater, and blood that makes up our Southern culture and it is for this very reason that I love it. I also love Rebecca's true use of Southern idioms and pronunciations, but even without an interpreter you can see that it crosses the Mason Dixon Line in its relationships. If y'all DON'T know any folks like the ones in this book then, Dahlin', you have just got to get outta the house moah often!"
3,Too much hype for an okay book,"My sister raved about this book and passed it on to me. I am struggling to finish it. I like the story of the Ya-Yas but have trouble with Siddalee. She's whiny and shallow and spoiled. I think the book could've focused just on the Ya-Yas and been stronger. Everytime we come back to Siddalee, I get bored. I'm at the very end, but keep reading other books instead of finishing this one!"
3,What happened to the action,"As I am in grade 11, I would not have chosen this book. My mother lent it to me because I was in desperate need of a book for my ISU. As I started reading, it was great, I couldn't put it down. But, about half way through it, the action just stopped. What happened. The book became a bugger to read and I began dreading picking it up every time I had a few minutes in class to read. Right now, I am in the process of writing my essay on it. The topic is getting acceptance from your family. If this is the type of book you enjoy reading, then I say you'd love this book. Otherwise, this book sucked."
2,It was okay . . .,"I listened to the audio of this novel. The author did a good job of reading -- bringing the different characters to life. I didn't love this book, however, because it was too full of cliches -- the over-the-top Southern mother, the oppressive Catholic Church, etc. -- that it just didn't ring true. The plot was so predictable that I was bored most of the time. Obviously many others who read this book got more out of it than me, but I think I'll pass on anything else by Ms. Wells."
2,Southern cutie-fied formula,"Shame on you, 'becca. I hail from the very area you write of. I never heard anyone speak such French phrases! If they were Cajun, some may count. But rarely does a mid-to-upper class clique-like gal-group speak so; they'd deny their Cajun heritage in a heartbeat. I wanted to love this book, but couldn't. I wanted to like Vivi, in her lush-like splendor, but she came up so Hollywood, so thin, she disappeared after I put the book down. Wish Miss Wells hadn't welshed with such superficial and formulaic-contrived characters. Loved the cover of the book, though..."
4,A great read that will keep you up past bedtime.,"This was an excellent read, with rollicking, funny, catchy characters. It may not be great literature, but it's what I wanted to read. Like some other readers, I do have problems with how the plot was constructed. But, unlike others who have reviewed this, I liked the Sidda character. Even identified with her, to some extent. Nonetheless, I think she was a much more forced, contrived character, unlike the Ya-Ya's who seemed to just flow from the author's pen. In the same way, the attempt to produce closure between Sidda and her mom seemed rather forced and contrived, not flowing. In the end, the resolution did seem to work for me, but was also a bit of a let down. Maybe I was just bummed out that such a wonderful read was ending."
5,Incredible!,"This is one rare treasure, Rebecca Wells. It will make you laugh, cry and want to be a part of the Ya Ya's! It was given to me as a BD present from my sister. It is a hearwarming story and one book that you won't want to end! Wells writes straight from the heart for women everywhere. I have recomended this book to other family members and friends."
5,"A Great Piece...Funny, Real, and from the heart","Rebecca West has an incredible command of language, situation(s), involving the reader in such a way, that the YA YAs become part of their lives...It's hard finding such a wonderful read!!! Congratulations, Rebecca!"
1,Southern-flavored VooDoo Yuk-Yuk,"This book lives DOWN to its goofy baby-ca-ca title. So many times I had to back up as I read, because I swore the book contradicted itself over and over again. I hate to agree with one of the characters in the book, but I think Buggy had it right when she said that Vivi and her friends were spoiled, self-centered and childish. I complained out loud so much as I read this book that my husband repeatly asked why I was wasting my time reading it. I finished it just so I would have the right to critique it. The book is supposed to be about relationships between mothers and daughters. On this level I found that the book was exceedingly shallow. Just because you light a candle and invoke some goddesses's name, does not mean you have spirituality or depth of relationship. What a waste!!! As a woman, I am insulted. If I were a Southerner, I would be horrified, if a Catholic, mortified at the portrayals, which may be viewed as the ""norm"" for that part of the population."
1,Exploits People,"This book was a sappy, cheesy story which does not deserve any credit. It is similar to his other books, like ""I know this much is true."" The only reason anyone gives it any respect is because it was on Oprah's Book Club and people are too afraid to say anything bad about it because they think people will make fun of them or something. The content really was not that great, and I feel it is time someone spoke up and denied Oprah her instant bestseller powers."
1,"Boring, Petty, Poorly written, and Boring!!",I have never hated reading a book as much as THIS book. It was given to me by a friend who absolutely couldn't say enough GREAT things about it. I have read 2/3rds of this book and wasted way too much of my life on it. Tonight this book will join the logs in the fireplace. I can't believe women can be this petty.
1,"it deserves less than one star, but that wasn't an option.","This ranks as one of the worst books I have ever picked up. The writing was so poor, so uninspired, so trite and full of cheap stereotypes, I can not for the life of me understand what all the hub bub is about. The story line of Sidda was poorly written and silly and the story line of the ya yas unbelievable. I read this for my book group, but could not bring myself to waste my time to finish it. I sat in a group of six women who loved it and felt like I had landed on some strange planet. I just wanted to scream ""this writing is garbage!"" ""this is not good literature, it will not stand the test of time!"". But alas, I was alone. After reading this drivel, I want to run and pick up a Jane Austen novel or Thomas Hardy to remind myself what truly wonderful writing is."
5,Happy Hour,What an fun novel. I enjoyed traveling back and forth between intertwining stories and times. I would have a cocktail with the Ya-Ya's any day.
1,A Chore,"Someone gave it to me to read! It took months to get through this tripe. Lots of tedious details. Book about close female southern friends, problematic mother/daughter relationship... nothing rang particlarly true. Forgetable writing style and story. Sorry I picked it up, actually, because my own mother was passing away the entire time it took to read this book. I sat in the hospital with this terribly boring story, determined to finish it. This family paled in comparison to my own family dynamic (the mother even paling by comparison) which made this boring book seem doubly trite for me at this time. Oy, so happy it's behind me."
1,She's made a mint with this one. Too bad!,"Insipid characters, contrived plot, shallow writing: food for the masses. I wouldn't have a problem with this book if it weren't for the fact that it's being passed off as literature. In fact, I expect that Oprah will soon enough adopt it as a must-read. It ought to be shelved next to Danielle Steele- categorically that would be more appropriate."
1,Ho Hum,"Silly book about an aging yuppie and her relationship with alcoholic mother and mother's relationship with alcoholic ""sisters"". Oh yuck. I was simply unmoved by the angst of these priviledged, white, Dixie debs. The characters were flat and predictable. The grossly overdone references to food, booze and flowers were, I suppose, meant to be sensual. It left me retching. There was precious little here to be of any real interest or value."
2,Depth?,"Entertaining at times, easy read, but I am not recommending it unless I can get rid of my copy of the book. I sure would like to think Southern women have more depth. The ones I know do."
1,Down with Ya-Ya,"It's no wonder this book was created: what a copy of the humerous Bridget Jone's Diary. This book was tedious and dull, the cover art was a bit nasty to look at also. The day to day writings of this was a bore to read, okay...day 1: do dishes. Day 2: go get groceries, chatted. Etc.etc this book just didn't stop. Why would we want to know her choices of vegetables? Huh, the author was trying to hard to be funny. Worst of all, I had the hardest time remembering this title and the authors name, all I could remember was divine and ya-yas. Briget Jone's Diary is still my beloved humorous fiction."
1,Utterly overrated!!,"The Ya Yas are a bunch of selfish, useless, inconsiderate, alcoholic women. I found absolutely nothing redeeming about their adolescent behavor. I forced myself to read this trite to the bitter end to see what all the raves were about, but I am still puzzled. I didn't find the book particularly amusing. Of course, I didn't like the Bridges of Madison County either, maybe I just have good taste!!! By the way I am a successful adult woman with many women friends who loves a good laugh and a good time."
1,Ya - Ya 's --- please drown the dog!,"Because I am a woman, raised in the South, and a Catholic I am absolutely disgusted by the mindless drivel I have just read in this book. Not only are the characters irresponsible, self-centered lushes, it seems that all of them have someone in their past to blame for all of their problems. On top of trying to deal with all the emotional garbage of these shallow characters, there is Hueylene the dog. The presence of this dog in the book did nothing but aggravate the reader. I think it would have improved slightly if the Ya-Yas had drowned the dog in the drinking water when they went for their famous swim!"
1,Disappointing,"This is the WORST book that I have ever read! In fact, I didn't finish it. What a waste of money. I don't understand how anyone could relate to that type of writing. The ya-ya language is unreal!"
2,Ugh--,"A rich, selfish and spoiled southern woman who loves her bratty childhood friends more than her husband and kids is not a very appealing lead character nor is she particularly complex or interesting -- but the author seems to think we should admire her and find her fascinating. Not!Dont believe the hype-- Dont buy the book"
5,My Favorite of All Time,This is truly a soul searching book!For those of us raised in the south and no longer able to live there Wells takes us back.She also makes you realize you don't always have to understand life just accept it with all the good and bad.
1,Worthless.,I wish I could give it 0 stars. Completely trite garbage. It's only redeeming factor? The movie was worse.
2,SADER THAN SAD,THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT A GIRL TELLING A REPORTER ABOUT HER ABUSIVE CHILDROOD. WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED IN TIME MAGIAINE THE MOM GOES BALISTIC. HER MOM'S LIFE LONG FRIENDS COME TO HELP. THEY SHOW THE GIRL ABOUT HER MOTHER'S SAD ABUSIVE CHILDHOOD. THEN THEY TOLD HER THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY. THEY SHARE MEMORIES WITH THE GIRL AS SHE HAS NIGHTMARES OF HER MOTHER HITTING HER. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD SHOW ALL THAT ABUSE IN ONE MOVIE BUT I THINK THE PLOT WAS GOOD. IF THEY HAD NOT GOTTEN DRUNK ALL THE TIME IT WOULD BE GOOD. I HATE THE ABUSE!
5,Gives depth to LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE,"When I call DIVINE SECRETS... a personal read, what I mean is it gets to the core of issues that touch the heart. Not everybody is fated to lead a colorful life like the one mother and daughter Vivi and Sidda share. But their story perfectly illustrates how time can heal all wounds if we let it, and how love truly prevails over even the most painful of obstacles.Although author Rebecca Wells' book LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE (with the same cast of characters) can stand alone, it somehow seems incomplete or unfinished once you read this one. DIVINE SECRETS... completes the picture. I recommend that if you read one, read the other as well."
2,A better movie!!!,"I didn't wait for the library's copies to be returned and I wish I did.Siddalee Walker is one of the least sympathetic characters I've ever read. Though they are spoiled and self-centered, the Ya Ya Sisterhood saves this book.Here's an interesting fact: most of what happens in the movie does not happen in the book, and the movie makes tons more sense. Normally I am a purist when it comes to movies made from books, but I much prefered the movie version.Most of the dialogue in the book didn't make it into the movie, which is good because Wells is too concerned with making things sound beautiful and poetic, so much that the dialogue is barely believable. ...And not everyone speaks French, thanks."
3,I'd rate it 3.5 if half-stars were an option.,"I shy away from bestsellers and anything ""Oprah,"" but was pleasantly surprised by this effort. It's so difficult to express the core of dysfunction without sounding sophomoric - but the author succeeds. However, it's difficult to distinguish everyone's cutesie names and I still struggle to understand the need for the dog Hueylene, whose useless presence is forced upon the reader throughout. As the Ya-Yas chat, we must be told that the dog's tail thumps on the carpet. It just bugged me, that's all. But I really did enjoy the book and would love for Ms. Wells to write more - with a new cast of characters."
2,"Ya-Ya? No, No!","Oh, please. If I didn't know better, I'd have thought a man wrote this book. It just didn't ring true. The writing itself is not particularly good, and the story seemed rather pointless. I just didn't buy the whole Ya-Ya sisterhood."
2,Disappointing and weird,"I loved Little Altars Everywhere and looked forward to Divine Secrets, but found Ya-Ya's disappointing and annoying. The characters, which were quite funny and touching in Little Altars, were suddenly boring, especially Siddalee. The flashbacks about Vivi as a child were good, but what happened to the fact that she had molested her children in Little Altars? What happened to Siddalee's brothers and their not-so-endearing relationship with their predatory mother?"
4,Heart Warming and True,"This book resonated within me. It spoke of relationships between mothers, sisters, daugthers and friends and I could related to each of these. In our lives, we are are in turn daughters, sisters and mothers,wives and lovers too, and I related to Sidda in her quest for her mother's love, to Vivi even in her darkest moments, to Caro in her protectiveness of her friend. For me, it was just about life, as it happens to people... and that what struck my heart.I thought the book was well written, beautifully paced... I went from page 65 to page 800 without even realizing it. Some characters are strongs, other a bit more absent, but it didn't make the book any less strong.I would strongly recommend this book."
4,"Like It, But Little Altars I Loved","This story will make much more sense if you read Little Altars Everywhere first. That being said, this is the story that reveals the uglier side of the two books. Definitely heart-wrenching at times, it's life at both its worst and best. The characters are delightful and entertaining. Overall, this is worth the time to read."
5,Laughing and Crying at the same time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW!!!!!!!!! What a book. It has parts that leave you rolling on the floor laughing, and other parts that leave you with tears streaming down your face. Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is a truely remarkable book, with witty dialogue, and a wonderful plot and strange and interesting charicters. It doesn't take much to get into this book, with funny scenes that make you think about how wonderful life realy is. Then there are scenes which are so profound and sad. But there is the right ammount of both to leave you at the end with a content feeling, because it wraps up perfectly."
4,On Divine Secrets,"I've never read a more colored, textured description of Southern (Cajun) life. The voices, drinks, clothes, picnics and people kept me enthralled. This bittersweet book is not for those who demand plot over character developement. WARNING: Don't read Rebecca Wells' other book 'Little Alters Everywhere' first. It is depressing instead of bittersweet, and will make it difficult to read 'Divine Sisters of the YaYa Sisterhood.'"
4,"Entertaining, a good summer read","This book was quite entertaining! I read it on a beach trip with my two best girlfriends, making it all the more fun. Then we went and saw the movie. The book makes the movie all that more enjoyable, so I highly reccommend reading it first. A good book for those who feel a relation to the Ya-yas."
4,Divine Ya Ya Sisterhood,"My review: Slow starting (first 50 pages) the author picks up from there and finally captured my attention. When she did I was at times enchanted by the 'real life' honesty that flows throughout the book. Weak in spots, the first series of letters was sometimes boring but mostly weak surrounding the character of Sidda and the very brief encounters with Sidda's fiance seemed amateur. What enthralled me to finish the book however, is the authors magic pen of description that she finally got around to displaying. I started out trudging through the first half and by the time I was finished I loved this story. It is refreshingly honest and the author circles the dynamics inside of situations with home spun grit; much flavor and consistent real life soul to the end. (Sidda's character needing more foundation and structure though)"
1,Put me to sleep!,"I have to agree with the reviewer Shannu, this book was highly recommended to me but in my opinion completely boring. I felt like I was back in college and had been assigned a text to read instead of reading for pleasure. It was torture and put me to sleep each time I picked it up. I actually enjoyed the author's writing style and will read another of her novels but I just couldn't keep interested in the story line. After reading many reviews of this novel I can see that 95% of the reviewers would disagree with my opinion so it would probably be safe for someone reading my review to pick up the book and read it themselves. Hopefully, you won't expect much and then be pleasantly surprised."
2,so so chic,"Do you remember the Nancy Drew novels? Nancy was always hopping into her sporty roadster in her smart suit.This book is full of that breathless girly detail. Why do we need to know that Sidda ate brie and ground wheat crackers? What's wrong with crackers and cheese? What's the point of all the socio-cultural window dressing?There is a glimmer of real emotion in here but not worth the read! Reminded me of the ""trash novels"" of my girlhood.This book was recommended by a friend so I gave it a try- but there's just too little time in life for stuff like this. If you read the good books first, or at least the intelligent trashy entertainment, you'll never get through this book. Of course the author has had some kind of real emotional experience, but her attempt at revealing it is an insult to every abused child of a raging alcoholic. Dig deeper and drop the bestseller nonsense.I know- it's all been said in many reviews, and better. I gotta go read now."
2,"Ya-Ya? No, No!","""You MUST read this book!"" I was told time and time again, usually with a scrap of paper and the title scribbled on it. ""Even though you're a guy - read it! You'll love it!"". So finally I got it...and read it...and didn't particularly love it. I liked it - somewhat. Yet, with all the hype surrounding it (from SO many people), I wanted to love it. Why didn't I love it? Because the characters were no more than caricatures, the plot was plodding, the humor forced, and the ending could be seen by Helen Keller. Wells had her eye on the ""Oprah Book Club"" logo when writing this book, but (surprise!) the book isn't depressing enough to warrant Oprah's stamp of approval. Which is why I liked it - somewhat. Lately, people have been telling me ""You MUST see this new movie! You'll love it!"" with a title scribbled on a piece of paper. Guess what the title is?"
3,Wished I coulda liked it,"There are over 700 reviews of this book, but I thought I should lower the 4 star count a bit more. I really wanted to like this book. (A friend who LOVED it loaned it to me) Unfortunately, I had a hard time caring about the characters. Sidda is 40 year old going on 11. Get a grip. A lot of us have traumatic or sometimes unhappy childhoods. But we usually realize that we are responsible for our own happiness pretty early. Sidda seems to enjoy the role of the victim and therapy a bit too much. Her mother, Vivi, also has a hard time moving on with life. Maybe it was genetic. As far as I could tell the mother was a passionate, but selfish egotist. I could relate to some of the feelings she had, but her actions were inexcusable. These are small people that I couldn't get behind. I did like the friendship of the Ya Yas (I have friends like that), but the story just wasn't there. Too bad."
1,let's not worship weakness,"Coming from a family of stong women, I am ashamed to have read this book. Its glorification of female weakness is deplorable. Even worse, so many women seem to admire these characters that hate their children, get drunk, and have no meaningful relationships with their husbands. Here's hoping my generation will turn this trend around."
1,Shallow women play-acting at life,I really wanted to like this book. All my friends loved it and I was told I'd laugh and cry through the whole thing. I never laughed and only wanted to cry over the time I wasted on it. The characters lack depth and are content to remain shadows of real women. The minority of reviewers who disliked this book echo my sentiments exactly.
4,An enjoyable read,"I didn't hate this book as many other reviewers have, but didn't love it as much, either. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy the book and found it a fast, fun read. This book did not change my life, or increase my interest in any particular reading genre or subject, which is what I usually like a book to do. However, I really liked the development of Vivi's character -- I liked seeing her as a young girl, as a mother, and as an older woman. I enjoyed these characters, and was eager to read more about their lives. I immediately purchased Little Alters Everywhere after reading this book, and have been enjoying it as well. In essence, this book is a very enjoyable escape for a few hours with some wonderful characters, but don't expect it to be more than that."
1,garbage,"this book was some of the most heavy handed, trite garbage I have ever read. I love coming of age books, books about friendship, about interesting and wonderous cultures. This book sadly lacked the depth and originality and thoughtfulness that I hoped for. To this reader, it had all the makings of network, not even cable, made for TV movie of the week or sitcom."
1,"I looked for joy, I found obnoxious self-indulgence.","I read the entire book. I hated it. I kept expecting some explanation of the behaviour of the characters, and all I got were anecdotes. The last chapter was completely anticlimactic. I didn't like the daughter and couldn't have cared less if she got married to the stud or not. And the mother -- was the point just to prove that boozy old ladies were young once, too?"
4,A heavy drama and a light comedy all in one,This book made me laugh hysterically and sob at the same time. It was a real delight! I recommend it to anyone who knows of the mysteries of the mother/daughter relationship.
3,"""that's life""...the good, the bad, the why and whatfors?","I loved it... a good read...visual....I wonder if it will be made into a movie?? Some scenes were so vivid....I can remember as a teen ager thinking my Mom was so ""kool"" when she would answer questions my friends, who were ""catholic"" were too afraid to ask of their mothers....she too, always with the drink in hand, and cigarette! The scene where Vivi ""drops the basket""....oh my, I was there....I remember only too well, with four babies, my own experience of very nearly dropping the basket..she was brilliant....and don't we all have a Lawanda experience lurking in the background that gave us the courage to ""try to BE"" and ride with it...Ms.Wells hits a lot of nerves and takes us to places some of us would rather not go...I think she does it with style and great sensitivity.....and somehow makes it ok for us."
2,I'd love to push the Ya-yas off a cliff.,"Unlike the Joy Luck Club, which heart-wrendingly details life and loss among four friends, this book reflects upon the non-events of stereotypical, two-dimensional Southern women who drink a lot. I was not laughing at Wells' grasping attempts at humor, and was bored through the rest. My eyes rolled at sicky-sweet expressions like ""Sippie-poo?"" and ""Ya-ya No!"" How can you enjoy such inane, shallow characters? But hey, if droll hokiness is your thing, you'll love this book."
1,"Skating on the success of ""Little Altars""","""Little Altars Everywhere"" was quite touching, the author clearly gifted (at times even Faulkner-esque). So I was floored at how poorly written and flat-out boooooring ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" is. I couldn't get past the fourth chapter. There's no trace of the talented writer from the previous novel, nor any glimpse of the lovable protagonist who, in this novel, is all but unrecognizable. It leaves one with the feeling that the author was under contract pressure and sat a monkey in front of her keyboard to fulfill it."
5,Excellent,"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is a warm, thoughtful, tale of the mother-daughter relationship. When I first picked up the book I found Rebecca Wells' prose somewhat gushy. I soon discovered that Wells' style was simply lush and languid, with a tone I haven't read before. As the story progressed with memories and flashbacks I became absorbed in the Ya-Ya world. Truly an original work with humurous, real, characters."
5,Great! Close to home! It kept me laughing!,"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood was great! I really loved it! This is a must read, especially if you are from the South. I am from Louisiana myself where the book is set and that just made it better for me! I hope that everyone who reads this book falls in love with Vivi Walker and the other Ya-Ya's as much as I did. I hope that Rebecca Wells writes more books with these characters in them. It kept me laughing until the end."
5,Almost cried when it was done!,This was the best book I have read in the longest time! I absolutely loved it and STRONGLY recommend it! It was funny and sad and a million other emotions put together in a way that touches your heart and stays with you long after the book is finished. Well done!
4,Don't avoid reading this book,"I read this book after 3 cousins and an aunt read it, loved it, and recommended it. Now, we're working on the rest of our family, and I can brag that I've commited 2 more faithful readers! The title turned me off, (sounded too silly) but once I started reading, I looked forward to reading it in my bed at night, the only time I have to read all day. It wasn't perfect-but it came very close. Rebecca Wells has done an excellent job of capturing the idea of women's friendship's in the south. It had the right touch of sadness, humor, and the whole thing was all and out interesting."
1,IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I DON'T FINISH A BOOK,"This book was ridiculous, confusing and totally boring. I tried and tried to get into it, but I just couldn't. I would not recommend this book to anyone!"
1,WHY IS THIS A BEST SELLER?!,I picked up this book after seeing it remain on the Bestseller list for so many weeks/months and for the life of me I can't figure out WHY this is a Bestseller?! I was so bored by this book I stopped half way through. The characters and story was uninteresting and I couldn't get into the authors writing style. Being a woman with a core group of long-term close female friends I still felt this book was a complete waste of time and disappointment.
4,Great Summer Read,"I saw the movie before reading the book and felt that the movie was lacking somthing, so I picked up the book.Mind you,I have a pile 10 books high of Oprah books I keep meaning to read, but with 4 wild kids, it just never seems to happen.This book happened--it pulled me in immediately.Not only did it touch nerves regarding my own feeelings about my mother, but it made me think of my own feelings AS a mother.I wondered if I was screwed up, or if I was doing the screwing up part to MY kids,lol.Sometimes, when all that can be seen is ""the relationship"" with one's parent/children- it is hard to tell, but by the end of the book one comes to terms with it all to some degree, an acceptance that basically ""life is short, but it is wide.""What an iteresting book ,not just the stories of Sidda and Vivi, but the story it makes the reader remember of her own memories and childhood. The stories the reader sees her children remembering one day."
3,Good Writing,"I admire this book more for its gorgeous writing style more than the plot and characterization. Sidda could've been fleshed out more, and the Ya Ya Sisters themselves seemed cliched stereotypes more than flawed and human, as one of the reviewers noted. It didn't seem very real and belivable to me, but it is fiction, so I won't be too hard on the book for that. What made me enjoy it the most was the way it was written, though. Rebecca Wells is very talented in that respect."
4,entertained,"This book is a wonderful book. It has such a variety of dynamics going on. It made me laugh, cry and totally left me in surprise. It was a very good book. I absolutely recommend it!"
4,My Fourth Time Around,"I just finished reading for the fourth time and now I'm beginning Little Altars Everywhere. Divine Secrets is a wonderful insight into the different relationships of women. This book actually made me laugh until I cried. Read it like I did, with an open mind. I hope you'll enjoy it!"
2,Disappointing,I picked up this book because of all the hype about the movie and now I fail to see what all the hype is about. I found the story very disjointed with too many undeveloped characters including Siddalee. Hope the movie was better.
2,Pul-eeeze!,"Contrived. If you're the type of person who buys into every little glee and cliques of so-called womanhood, you'd like this book. (The movie was even harder to sit through.) If you have any discriminating taste at all, you'll be bored. If still courious, get it from your library."
1,The dumbest book I almost finished,"This so called work made me embarrassed to be a woman and by the number of 5 star reviews I feel the world may come to an end. If you have any taste in literature and feel deep in your soul that you are a ""grown up"" I would recommend not wasting your precious life on earth reading this jibberish. There are no redeeming qualities to be found. Reading this was like chinese water torture, or screeching nails on a blackboard. I wouldn't trust any woman who thinks this type of literature is ""wonderful?"" because she is not a woman, she is stuck at age 7."
1,"Poorly written, with incredibly annoying characters","I know I'm in the minority, but I hated this book. The writing is terrible, the characters completely unrealistic and extremely annoying. (And don't get me wrong--I'm a woman who highly values female friendship as well as humor writing.) I literally threw the book across the room at one point. A real waste of money."
2,Exhausting,"I didn't realize this book was a sequel. I just read it on its own without any familiarity from prior reading.It feels like the ""strong Southern women with lots of secrets that are gradually revealed"" plot has been done enough already. I got exhausted by these characters and the word ""ya ya"" was pounded into my skull like a spike.If you are into these kinds of plots, you'll love it. If watching ""Steel Magnolias"" was all you needed to satisfy any craving for ""strong Southern women"" stories, don't bother. (I suspect that few men will enjoy this book. That could be part of my problem with it.)"
5,"Can I rate this ""6"" Stars?",Wow! This is a novel that never leaves the reader. The Ya-Ya'sare the sisterhood we all long to be a part of. This is a book for every woman.
4,Women Empowerment... Pre Mentrual Syndrome,"This book epitomized the complexity of women. While they can be wonderful and powerful creatures, we are also weak and moody. Overall I really like this book it was light and fun to read but definately had substance. You are drawn very easily into the book and fall in love with characters instantly. But at the same time feel bad for them because in some ways, their seemingly happy and wild life is kind of sad and pathetic.Really liked it!"
5,A Favorite Southern Charmer,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. The YaYa's are a group of women who have grown up together and now have families of their own. Throughout the different stages of life, the YaYa's stick together, sharing in one another's joys, pains and laughs. They accept each other despite their weaknesses and faults and love each other unconditionally. This book is full of southern charm and is an endearing story of friendship, love, struggle and pain -all the facets of life. It will make you want to be a member of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood!"
2,I just really didn't like it,"I just couldn't make a connection with this book. While I liked Vivi and the other Ya-Yas, I really did not like Siddalee at all. She just seemed so whiney and annoying to me. I didn't really care what happened to her, and I thought her boyfriend would be better off without her and her stupid little problems.The really sad thing is that I automatically don't want to read a book when a reviewer compares it to this book. I'm probably missing out on some good reads."
4,Happy endings don't just happen in Disneyland.,"I first heard about this book from my sister, thinking it was silly and trite, I ignored it, until my curiosity got the best of me.I'm glad it did.Wells does an excellent job of portraying the frustrations of a young mother in an unhealthy marriage. After discovering the sad fate of her lover, Vivian reluctantly agrees to marry the next man in line, who happens to admire and love her more than she ever could. Problems from the marriage stem out to Sidda and her siblings.After Sidda gets a successful boost in her media career, she gives an exclusive interview on her life that brings up memories of the past and from that interview starts the painful healing process between Mother and daugther, and also between Mother and Father.Wells book tells us that happy endings do exist, even in the most bitter of situations.It's a shame that the movie couldn't do the same."
5,Transplanted Yankee finally understands the South,"After spending five years in the south, I grew to admire southern women. They were warm and loving, with steel cores. Life may be going to hell around them, but they are dancing and cordinating the decorations.Ya-Ya is the same. The women (both the Ya-Ya's and Sidda) are personable complex characters. These are the women you want in your life. I laughed with this book, I cried with this book (and then I did it all over again with Little Altars).Wells is a great author who presents a well crafted story. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Like getting a glimpse into the rich, memory-laden scrapbook of your own family!","The companion of ""Little Altars Everywhere,"" this book takes the vantage of the adult Sidda. Although she's become successful on the outside, the inside still trembles at the damage inflicted by her mother Vivi while growing up.In an attempt to help her daughter understand - and possibly restore their terribly damaged relationship - Vivi sends Sidda a scrapbook filled with ""Ya-Ya-rabilia."" As Sidda flips through the book and examines each item, the voices of Vivi and the other Ya-Yas explain the context which the item represents. Quickly, Sidda realizes that her mother was once young and full of hopes, which were dashed by her dour parents and a tragic death.If you aren't a big fan of flashbacks, this might not be the book for you. However, Wells seems to do a good job, moving seamlessly from past to present and back. I highly recommend giving it a try!"
4,A book that can't be put down !,"This book was very moving, it was an emotional novel, one that stirs the emotion of a daughter- and has relevance to all mothers and daughters. I found the story to be engrossing. Very Faulkner-esque. A great talent out of the south, I hope Rebecca Wells writes more great novels like this one!"
2,A Glorification of Alcoholism,"This book is a hymn to alcoholism. It is awash in liquor. It seems as if the characters accompany every significant speech, action, and confrontation with a drink. Characters are drunk all the time, and a significant number of problems arise because of various people's drinking. Husbands and wives get drunk individually but don't talk, one character's marriage is considered good because her husband happily brings her drinks,a women leaves her family to go to a hotel and drink, the main character drinks brandy while ruminating on the effects of her mother's drinking. Hello? Didn't anyone else notice this? This is not divine, it is desperate. Because of that I found this book silly and 2-dimensional."
4,A poignant discovery story.,"I loved this book simply because it dealt with Southern women, their lives and relationships. The fact that it was set in Louisiana furthered my enjoyment because I lived there for some time. However, more than this, I loved this book because it poignantly illustrates how we look to our families for so much perfection and are always let down when we don't find it. That relations are not about finding answers necessarily, but about learning to love and accept imperfection."
2,too self-important,"it's all been done before - supposedly rule-breaking and wild but lovable women. they are certainly wild but hardly lovable. it is difficult to love a book with a heroine as hard to like as Vivi. even Sidda's dilemma has been done to death. and the way it was written seems to be cocky in a way, like it is expected of you to just simply love the book and characters. boring and unoriginal."
1,Boring---Read Something Else,"I agree with Nicole Bonnell, who is halfway through the book and can't take it anymore. I'm in the same situation. A good book holds the reader's attention quickly; there should be some kind of narrative hook that draws you in. I have no idea what that hook is in this book. The flashback scenes to Vivi's childhood are incredibly boring. I read voraciously, and based on everyone's praise of this novel, was sure this book would make my top ten list of books I love. I can't believe it's actually on my very short list of books I despise. My suggestion is to save your money; don't buy the book, as I did. Borrow it from the library to see whether you like it first. If you are a discerning reader, you will notice the humor is not funny, and the characters are one-dimensional and unintriguing."
5,"It will make you laugh, cry and call your mother!",This book was AWSOME!! The characters are loveable to say the least. I really identified with Sidalee and all of her trials with her mother (who hasn't had those?!). What was really great was how she came to know her mother in a different light - through her friends (the ya ya's).The story touched on every emotion I own. It was a really incredible reading experience. And the best part -- it has a happy ending!! Bravo Rebecca Wells!
4,Great 'chick' book,"I loved the Yayas. Even though I grew up in neighboring Texas, I could hear and smell my childhood in the narrative. The book will not go down in history as a classic nor will it be taught in schools for years to come but you will want to by a copy for your best girlfriend. Like many of us, Siddalee learns to appreciate her mother as she matures."
2,Poorly written and unbelievable,"Caveat: Everyone in my book club liked this book except me. I just didn't buy the characters at all. I got so annoyed I put it down half-way through. Contrived, sloppy, and the characters were pretty unappealing."
4,perpectives from a daughter of an alcoholic,"This book nailed me. I stuck with it because a beloved friend told me it was wonderful. I realize, however, that I loved it for different reasons than she did. The portrayal of the emotional scars of growing up in a family with mental illness was very accurate.For any one with a history of alcoholism in their family: This book can be tough, it can trigger some unattractive memories, but it also can help you start down the path of forgiveness."
2,Hope the movie was better than the book,"I heard all this hype about this book and was not impressed at all...I had a hard time picking it up to read it...I thought...It must be me! Or it's going to get better, BUT it didn't. I was hoping for a lot more than the book had to offer..."
3,Divine Secrets?? definetly!!,"I cant say I loved this book, but I cant say I didnt like it either.Some parts were amazing, very funny, well written and with many divine secrets and rituals... having said that, I would have left the book at that, because I didnt really like the main character. Her ""horror stories"" really took out most of the fun of the rest of the book. She is a very complicated person, who had a rough life, but who made very strange decisions that deeply wounded the people around her.The 4 friends are truly amazing... I really wish we could all have received that kind of support when we have needed it, but I dont think they could exist in real life.In the end, I have mixed feelings about the book, if I could... I would have read only the funny parts, and skipped the rest."
4,Not what I expected,"After hearing (and reading) all the hoopla about this novel, I was very excited to finally get to read it. It started a bit slow for me and I really couldn't understand Sidda's problem and reasoning for ""going away for a little while."" The high points were definitely all about the Ya-Ya antics, and I feel guilty that I couldn't appreciate the message about mothers and daughters until the last few chapters. However, I did enjoy this novel and I was kept interested until the very end. But I liked LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE tons better. It's a lot darker and more sad, but it touched me deeper than DIVINE SECRETS."
4,wonderful!,"This is a wonderful book! You will laugh, you will cry and you will want to call your mother and tell her you love her. You will also appreciate your girlfriends much more! Read it. It is an easy read, but it will get to your heart."
2,Pretty weak novel,"I was disappointed by this book. I'd just read ""The Triumph and the Glory"", which I thought I wouldn't like all that much because it was set during the Second World War and is supposed to be s guy book, but IT WAS SUPERB, it was just beautiful there at the end. I expected that I would like Ya Ya Sisterhood but it left me cold. Go figure . . ."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"Considering the amount of reverential press and copycat clubs this book inspired, I was less than impressed. The heroine was pretentious and unsympathetic and the Ya-Ya's were, to put it bluntly, annoying. I do not recommend this book unless you're someone who still swoons over or is somebody still in thrall of your high school's cheerleading squad."
2,Excellent writing-unrealistic storyReb,Rebecca Wells is an excellent writer. I found the story very unrealistic. I had a lot of difficulty finding any sympathy for the ya-yas . They appeared immature and selfish throughout and try as I might I could not finish this book.
2,Not hard to put down,"I read the Ya Ya sisterhood for a book club. while I finished it and even found some of it entertaining, it was the the type of book that I just could'nt put down. I read before bed, and I had no trouble putting it down to go to sleep. The best part of reading this book, was when I was finished and found out how the others in my book club felt about it. Some were absoulutly enthralled by it while others found that it hit to close to home and stopped reading midway. I enjoyed some of it, but I would not recommend it to my friends."
5,Brilliant Observations,"Loved it, loved it, loved it. I loved page 258 of ""Divine Secrets"": ""She thought of the tall, stately black woman who had fed her, dressed her, hand washed her delicates, played with her, sung to her, and listened to her with tenderness.""It's even better than a favorite passage from another fave, from ""Of Woman Born"" by Adrienne Rich. On page 254 it reads: ""My Black mother . . . fed me, dressed me, played with me, watched over me, sang to me, cared for me tenderly and intimately."""
4,Every woman should read this book.,This book made me laugh and cry all at the same time. I couldn't put it down. I finished it the day after I bought it. I began to realize that I have the same fears that Sidda does. Everyone woman should read this book.
1,Boring.,"I can't imagine why this was on the bestseller's list for so long. After reading 100 pages and hoping it would get better, I decided it was a total waste of time and put it down. How it ever got published in the first place I will never know."
2,Very contrived and convoluted.,"A book supposedly showing the strength and tenacity of Southern women. Hard to relate to characters who were psychotic, self-absorbed, indulgent alcoholics who beat their children. Maybe I don't appreciate the allure of the South because I'm a Yankee."
3,This book has been far overrated.,"While this novel has its moments of wisdom about life and living it, it is also full of moments made for Hollywood. The conversations are at times heartwarming, at times trite. There is truely one character in the book, the others are almost superfluous."
2,Please ! This is not the south !,"I half way enjoyed this book. I picked it up from the new book shelf in my library just after it hit the bookstores. And just as I thought, many, many readers believe it to be a portrayal of southern women. I have NEVER met anyone like these characters. And I don't think I live a sheltered life. In addition, I read about ""Ya, Ya friendship groups"" popping up all over the country. Many of these people were ""discovering"" friendships with women for the first time in their lives. How Sad ! To think this book about drunks, smoking fiends, and (as seen in Little Altars)child abusers, directed women to cherish the other women in their lives; and how bizarre to need a ritualistic club to do it in. Personally, I would rather have experienced more about Sidda's relationship with her boyfriend. He seemed really wonderful ! Who WAS that guy?"
1,Yucko-Yucho,"I found this book and its characters annoying. I am fascinated that this book about insecure, childish adults is so popular."
1,predictable and trite,"Wow...is this the dumbing down of America if so many people give this 5 stars? The book was so self-serving about boring, self-indulgent, contrived characters...especially the boyfriend...yeah right, he was a cardboard cut-out..and the scenes of Lake Quinalt...please..it was so unreal. I really skipped many pages out of boredom...and that I really didn't care about these women at all! This whole book was like a comic strip with no depth. Yes, I can see the film now...with the cast of Friends....ya da ya da ya da."
1,Poorly Written,The story has its moments but it can't make up for the inconsistencies in plot and poor writing quality throughout. Wells style is awkward and fumbling.
1,good for me to poop on,This book was really awful. I am a college professor at a midwestern university and I can truly say that this book was awful. Don't waste your time on such tomfoolary!
2,YAWN.....zzzzzz,"I was so bored with this book that I read only half of it. This would be a good book for relatives of the author, but as an outsider, I just ended up not caring about her mother's scrapbook, or any of the characters. I think I felt this was because it seemed TOO personal a read and I didn't feel a part of it in anyway, therefore, not caring about the subject."
3,not nearly as good as I thought it would be,"I was not impressed with this book. There were some highlights, the best parts were when Sidda was going through the scrapbook. Overall though, not that great. Will not be seeing this in theaters, will wait til it comes out on dvd and rent it, not buy it!"
3,Let's hear more about the other Ya-Yas,"I thought this was an interesting book, but the most intriguing part of the story, the friendship between the four women, was hardly touched. I would have loved to hear more about how they all supported each other through the years, how they laughed, how they cried.One other thing - I could not understand why Vivi engendered such loyalty in these other Ya Yas. She certainly tried their patience!! I think I must have missed those qualities in the Vivi character. However, I thought the Lawander the Elephant anecdote was simply wonderful - oh that something that inspirational had happened to me as a child!"
3,"You sir, ARE A LIAR!",So...ummm...the bag is pretty nice. It seems to be really well made. It isn't actually produced by Dickies. There is a tag on the inside which states its true manufacturer. Doesn't matter much in the long run.well madenot many pocketsno pen slotshandle is niceside pockes are very thin and mostly uselessgood for bookssmurfs wind up smothered and dead if left in the bottom of bag
5,Sweet like candy,"Super catchy, electro pop goodness. I can't stop playing Papercuts!!! Put on a great show at the Diesel U:Music Awards"
4,Just like Kings Canyon book,very good book and hike guide but I found much of the information the same as the companion King's Canyon hikers guide
1,Disappointed,"I ordered a new battery because my old one was lasting only 1 or 2 days with limited or no use before it needed recharging. The first couple of weeks, this one lasted a week. After less than a month of use, it nows needs recharging every 3-4 days.The price was great, but it seems that it is on the way to being as bad as the one I replaced--just a lot sooner."
5,A must for 1st time home buyer to understand the process,"We are trying to decide whether or not to buy or first home (since we may or may not move away in a year). This book took me through the process step by step, including tax benefits. I even took the information from the book, entered it into last years Turbo Tax file to see how this years return would have been different. I've heard so much about how a home is a tax shelter, but now I see the numbers of how and why. The explanation cleared the muddle of the different types of loans and many other things to think about."
1,Needs Work,1. It slows down the computer significantly2. Can't get it to do exactly what it's supposed to do3. Came with 2 cameras but only one can be used at a time4. Causes significant interference with my wireless internet no matter what channel it is placed onHow can you sell a person 2 cameras and only one can be used at a time and on top of that you have to be physically at the device to make the switch so its a waste for remote users.
2,Sudden breakdowns,"This is my second maker, but both have suddenly stopped working.Nice features, but too much money for such little time....Mr. Coffee next time......"
4,"Nice gloves, but they were stolen","The gloves appeared to be well made and looked very nice. My wife got many compliments on the the first day she wore them out riding with her regular trail ride group. Problem was, I guess someone else thought they were pretty nice too, as they were stolen fromt he barn while she was putting up her horse. May have to go to the Dover store to replace so as to avoid the shipping charges."
4,Happy with the choice,Should have gone with a medium but a good fit around the wrist with the adjuster snap. Seems to be made well.
2,Call before placing order!!,"I now notice it say 36 count!! I am not sure who changed that, but before I wanted a 5 lb. Hershey Bar!! When I called the Seller they did nothing!! They said sorry, and got me my 5 lb. Hersey Bar that I had to pay for in addition to the 36 Count that I had and could purchase a lot cheaper at a mini mart!!!"
1,Not a Helpful Book,This is not a helpful book for anyone. The author uses Tiger Woods to sell this book but does not have any real information about Tiger Woods' mental game. He hasn't even interviewed him. I have substantial knowledge in sport psychology and do not think golfers or athletes will be benefitted in any way by reading the book.
3,This may have been how it was!,"Set in a country that has had problems since WW II, this film makes us remember that people are people everywhere. Ordinary life goes on, even the ""party"" allows this. In spite of living conditions that are less than desireable, the inter-action between the couple is superb as they go from lust to Love. Even when he is in prison, she visits him dressed in her best dress. Far from complaining about his situation, he slowly lifts her dress to admire her black lace slip, and she leads him to make Love to her. They are interupted but it does not matter. Not an easily understandable film if you are not versed in Eastern European life under communisim. It gives a look into another [now long gone] world. The ending is not what you expect but plausible!"
5,Good reference book,For me this book finds the right balance. It's not too dry and not 'cute'. It's the book I had been looking for.
2,Not what's adverttised...,"After setting up the track, which is no more than the most basic take on the Hot Wheels starter, set, my kids were heartbroken to find out it didn't have the cars that were advertised to be included. I don't think I paid more than $40 for it, but that was WAY too much for a set that doesn't come with the, and I quote, ""Lightning McQueen, the King and Chick Murphy tearing up the track as they race hood-to-hood to claim the Piston Cup. This coliseum-style raceway track set delivers high speed racing, bringing the final scene of the upcoming Disney/Pixar movie, Cars to life. The dual-lane oval track has side by side racing, over twelve feet of track, motorized power booster and two kid-activated lane changers to avoid the pop-up crash car, and beat your opponent! Requires three ""D"" batteries, not included. Additional vehicles sold separately.""Definitely wouldn't pay what's being quoted here..."
1,Motor burned out in 5 minutes,"Our experience with this car set was terrible.Imagine my grandson's delight when we first started the set up, ran fine for 5 - 10 minutes, then nothing. We have tried changing the batteries, nothing works. I have called Mattel customer service but they are closed, so I will try again tomorrow.This is a great disappointment for my grandson. This was a Christmas present."
1,The motor is garbage - stay clear!!,I had the same experience as others but I feel compelled to report on this. A major disappointment. I did get through to Mattel this evewning and they will send a voucher. Rep said all of the many reports today had one common element in her estimation - all bought via Amazon. Too bad 0 stars is not an rating option.
1,GARBAGE!!! DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"My 8 year old nephew wanted 1 present for Christmas - the Piston Cup Track Set. I made sure that we had fresh alkaline batteries for it - when he opened it up Christmas Eve he was so excited that he put it together immediately. It spun the car around the track 3 times, then quit working. My nephew was so disappointed that he cried and I felt like a terrible aunt. After reading the rest of the reviews, it's obvious that this item has SERIOUS quality control issues! I am going to send it back to Amazon and try to talk my nephew into something else for Christmas, except that it's past Christmas now. To the manufacturer: YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES FOR ALLOWING SUCH A POOR QUALITY ITEM TO LEAVE YOUR FACTORY!!!!"
3,All Those Negative Reviews AFTER I bought it!,"I bought this item for Christmas and as you can see, most of the negative reviews came after Cyber Monday. The motor did develop problems within 15 minutes of use but in our case, it did seem to get better after we opened the case and cleaned out collie hair. :)The motor seems to be hypersensitive on this toy and just a little bit of hair or dirt does it in. (We have had to take it apart 2x in the last 8 hours!). It may end up going back to Amazon if the motor keeps dying.Definitely not a toy if you own a long haired dog!Added 12/26/06. It's going back and we will be replacing it with something else. When ALL the reviewers on the same day say it has the same problem, I think it's a bit more than Collie hair! Amazon, pull this product until Mattel fixes it!"
3,Really great,"Having spent a few days watching my 3 year old play with this toy has prompted me to elevate my initial assessment. Cars that work well include Lightning, Doc, Sally, Leakless, Nitroade, Chick, and Boost (who is really fast on this track!). Our batteries seem to be holding up well. My 3 year old is getting the hang of turning it off between races. Can always get recharcheables later if there's an issue (as another reviewer noted). We have all 4 playsets that make up Radiator Springs, and we're finding this adds another level of fun play for the Pixar Cars. Lots of fun.! Great birthday or holiday present at this price point. Your Cars luvin' kid(s) will get alot of playtime out of this sturdy track."
2,Doesn't work well,The motor that turns the wheels jammed the first day we used it. I had to take it apart and basically rebuild it to get it to work. You can't do more than 2 cars at a time and they have to be spaced out or the motorized wheels don't have enough juice to get the car around the track. Half the CARS cars don't even work. DJ gets jammed.
1,POS,My wife bought this for our 2.5 year old and he loved it for all of five minutes. That's when it broke and stopped working. He doesn't understand why we have to send it back....
1,Don't bother...,"I bought this set for my 3 yr. old son for Christmas. I set it up ahead of time and got to play with it a little...very cool set. On Christmas morning, he loved it and got to play with it for about 2 hours. Today, the day after Christmas, he woke up to play with it and it didn't even turn on. Looks like the motor is shot. I took it apart, changed the batteries, and nothing. Looks like a lot of other people are having the same problem. It's ashame that such a big name company and big name movie had such a horrible product. I will be taking my son out tomorrow to buy a new racetrack, definitely not a ""Cars"" one...next time, don't cut the corners, and make a product that will actually work for more than 3 hours. $40 for 3 hours, I don't think so."
1,Someone forgot to test this track,"I set this up on Christmas Eve for my 4 yr old. It was the first thing he went to on Christmas morning. Like all the other reviews, it ran a carthough about 4 or 5 times, then nothing. The motor is actually ok, but the problem is in the gears. Regardless, my son doesn't understand and he is begging me not to send it back. The product doesn't appear to be available for replacement...and for good reason. Merry Christmas son, I hope you like crap."
1,Piece of junk... Don't waste your time or money.,"Bought this for my 3 y.o. nephew for Christmas. My dad spent some time putting it together. Then, we put the car on it, and ""vrooooom"", round the corner and off the track. Tried again, same thing. I guess that's why it's called Piston!! It literally shoots off the track at a very high speed. Could really hurt someone. Finally got it to go around without flying off. And then, after 15 or so mins, nothing. Just stopped working. My dad is an electrician, so he tried fixing it, but no luck. It's absolute garbage!!"
4,A good track for kids,"These days, I've noticed a lack of good race tracks like I had growing up. We found this track in our quest as my kids love ""cars"" cars and the hot wheel sets are usually to narrow for these wider cars. I did not have the motor issues as some buyers had, but I've noticed some weakening spots where the plastic has changed colors four months later.I would not recommend this track for kids who are still at the rough on toy phase. Nor would I reccommend it for the current price listed. I put this in my cart at 69.99 dollars and watch it jump to 109.99 at Christmas. It's worth one hundred (maybe) but not almost double that!!"
1,What a waste!!,What a dissapointment! My 5 year old is a huge Cars fan and received this for Christmas. After minimal set up he was off and running and then came to a screaching halt. It worked for exactly 3 laps around the track and then stopped working. The booster made an odd noise and no longer launced cars. My husband took it apart and then it worked for another 2-3 laps. Just long enough to figure out the flexible poorly constructed track can not support the force of the cars without the connections coming apart. Do not dissapoint your little one like mine was...pretty sad Mattel!
1,Disappointed Child,"If able to, I would like to give this zero stars. It does not even rate one. I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He was thrilled with the toy. We put new batteries in it, the thing ran for maybe 15 minutes and has never worked since. We put new batteries in twice and still nothing. Also, its a racing set and yet you would not be able to have a ""race"" since only one car is included in the set. I'm disappointed Disney would put their name on something so worthless. Don't waste your money!"
4,Really fun but a bit flimsy,"My boys ages 2 & 3 received this for Christmas. It is really fun but it isn't as strong as other race tracks we have. It has a really strong motor and can really move the bigger vehicles from the Cars movie! We love that you can race 2 at a time. Our only complaints are that the track could be a lot sturdier, especially on the raised portions - it wobbles and falls occassionally, and the button that you are supposed to be able to keep the crash car from coming out doesn't work."
5,Great buy!!!,"We bought this for our 8 year old and 4 year old boys for Christmas. They both love it and have played with it every day since Christmas! We've had to buy a few of the cars on EBAY due to no store availability, but that was no big deal. A wonderful buy. The track has really held up and has kept the interest of both boys and their friends."
3,not the greatest,"[...] and it only comes with one car??? The product info refers to racing with a friend and changing lanes. Make sure to purchase other cars to avoid disappointment!! Some of the other Cars vehicles don't work that great with this set, Doc Hudson seems to work the best. Ramone barely makes it around and frequently falls off."
3,"Great idea, but defective motor?","My 4-year old son flipped when he saw this set up for him on Christmas morning. He had a blast sending his cars through the booster around the track. Throughout the day, I would say we had it turned on for a grand total of 20 minutes. We settled down to play with it again later in the afternoon and...the motor seems to have burned out :(Two cars shot through and then it instantly died. I went out and purchased new batteries, thinking that was the problem, but it didn't help. This is really unfortunate as my son absolutely loves this toy. We will try and take it back tomorrow to exchange it for another one. If that one breaks, then we'll give up on this toy and hope the something better is made in the near future.I'm not saying not to buy this toy. Just make sure to hang on to the receipt if you do."
1,Enormous disappointment,"Nothing new to add except that our track crapped out after 5 minutes, too. It was 5 minutes of fun, though. I am crossing my fingers that Mattel might release a 'fix' of some kind for the motor. I feel terrible for people who paid $100 and up for this track on other websites.We also purchased Criss Cross Crash by Hot Wheels for my son, and if you are looking for a track that works--that one does (with Hot Wheels or Matchbox cars only). It's set up right next to the now extinct Cars track.Make this right, Mattel and Disney Pixar."
1,Pixar track,"We got this race track for my son for Christmas. He was so excited. We set it up and I could tell right away that is was not durable. The track ran for about 20 minutes before the engine blew out. Luckily he had received some other ""Santa"" gifts that he loved. We returned it to Amazon the next day without any problem. Definatly not worth it."
5,worth it,"This works very well, the cars go very fast and keeps the kids entertained, pretty easy to put together too."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"My son's got this race track for Christmas - it was the only thing they asked for. I am so dissapointed with this item. First of all, the track is very cheaply made. It seems to fall apart if you just walk by it. We have not had the problem of it not working, like others, but it is so LOUD that they hardly want to use it. It seems like only one car can use it at a time or they start running into each other.I really expected more out of this race track for the price. I was very disappointed in all of the cars items we purchased this year. It just doesn't seem to be very entertaining to my kids."
3,Watch out for faulty motors,"The first track we had the motor stopped within 5 minutes. It was kinda disappointing, especially on Christmas morning. I ordered another one, but kept this track until the new one came becuase my son still liked to play with it even though the motor wasn't functioning. We have since received a new one and (crossing our fingers)it has been working great. The materials are flimsy, but that is how most of this car stuff is. Seems sturdier than hotwheels track. My son really enjoys this toy."
2,eh,"I will admit that Kittie has alot of balls coming onto the metal scene, for that they deserve an award. But, plain out, this music isn't to good. I was impressed with a few tracks by them, but other than that, not so good. I saw these girls awhile back, I remember they could barely hold their instruments, it was quite funny. This band can only get better with age and experience, in the mean time I suggest Exhumed, Dimmu Borgir, and Amon Amarath, you people need some real black metal."
1,what is this a joke ????????,"First of all these girls [are not good]. Don't get me wrong i love heavy metal music as much as the next person, but if this is what the call music they should go back to wherever they came from and stay there.all they do is say they have the best fans and scream in all the songs. Most of the songs sound the same.Also they have like old guys saying kittie rules in the intro. i gave kittie a chance and every song [was not good] on the dvd i think there are 10. As i saw earlier a guy put up he wanted to marry morgan lander {buddy pick a cute girl to marry}."
2,Better than nothing but not by much.,The program does not allow you to easily reuse previously entered data. Most of the time I would like to reuse the entered data for different resume types. But the program does not allow you to choose to use previoulsy entered data and makes you enter it again each time. So you must enter your employment history over and over.
1,Better than nothing but not by much.,The program asks for the same information over and over. Each time you change the resume format it ask for you employment history and education. This information is usually the same. The program should give you the option of reuse of previously entered information. Other users also mentioned a version 7.3. Yet when I called customer support and asked where to get the upgrade they either had no idea or said the program would automatically update during registration. Well the program does not self upgrade and the current 7.0 version has problems.
2,You can't use the resume's you create!,"The video and instruction is good, but you cannot print any ofthe resume's you create. Some lines don't space evenly or are right ontop of each other, making it unpresentable to a potential employer. You can export the resume to another program... END"
4,"Informative, objective work undercovering the real man","A very pleasurable reading, well researched, a work that brings Kennedy to his real light of man and politician and this is a useful deed because the judgement of his political action should NOT be influenced by the sad way in which his life ended. To the author's credit, Reeves begins describing how the truth in every field was distorted to promote Kennedy in the political arena, but in the end he can recognize too the cases in which the President acted effectively. Advisable to read."
2,"Interesting, boring, and anti-kennedy","Though I did find many of the facts in this book interesting, it was obvious that Thomas Reeves despised JFK and everything JFK stood for. He seemed to condemn all of JFK's supporters, especially Sorenson and Schlesigner, and did a poor job presenting the upside of his presidency. The book was not well written, it was one of the slowest reading books I have ever read, if I did not have to write a term paper on it I would have stopped reading it by the time it got to the 1960 elections, but I could see reffering back to it in the future if I ever need information about JFK."
1,A hatchet job on one of our most courageous & revolutionary presidents,Too bad there is so much money to be made by trying to assassinate President Kennedy's character. Authors like this guy and Sy Hersh won't get a penny from me.
5,The joy of Leaf Magic,"Thrilled with my book purchase. Easy to order, pay for, and arrived safely, less than two weeks later. The joy to receive a piece of my childhood = priceless."
1,BAD RAP!,MADE A MISTAKE BUYING THIS ONE! BIG SURPRISE WHEN I PLAYED IT FOR A FRIEND. DVD DESCRIPTION WAS NOT VERY CLEAR WHEN THE PURCHASE WAS MADE.
3,Good flick but,"I like he used a couple smaller names but how do you make a graf movie without even mentioning ATL?(showing a Sever piece in the intro doesnt count)Saber, obviously legitToomer, see aboveearsnot, goodPhilly writer, goes too far to be diff. feels like they doin anything to get out of NY shadow.claw, cute."
5,Triumphant first fiction!,"Every story in this collection resonates with the reader long after the story has ended. Sarah Nawrocki's ability to get you inside her characters is uncanny and oh so satisfying. These are stories to savor, and to read again and again."
3,Loved the Title,"The title drew me to this book. I should have anticipated the undercurrent of saddness, from the unique title. This is a VERY WELL WRITTEN book that kept me drawn to story after story. Unfortunately, I was left with an uneasy saddness after many of the stories and that is not what I want to experience when curling up to a book."
4,Comprehensive Cory,"This is the most complete, comprehensive collection of Corey Hart's most significant chart hits and album tracks to date...For those who are afficionados of hard edged rockers mixed with comtemporary ballads, then this collection is for you...Most impressive is Cory's heartfelt, emotional interpretation of the Elvis classic ""Can't Help From Falling In Love."" Other standouts include the MTV ready ""Sunglasses At Night,"" a quintessential hit of the 1980's and what I perceive to be his signature song ""Never Surrender."" By the end of the 1980's, Hart's vocal delivery and songwriting capabilities evolved (he recently contributed 2 tracks ""Where Is The Love"" and ""Miles To Go [Before I Sleep] for Celine Dion's megahit album ""Let's Talk About Love""). Unfortunately, he was omitted from the radio playlists all too soon. This collection highlights the best of his 1980's output. If you wish to follow Cory up to date, I highly recommend his 1998 import CD ""Jade."""
5,NEVER SURRENDER...,"Corey Hart's SINGLES was supposed to bring his best tracks from this first 5 albums...it almost does it.Among all the great tracks included here, we miss some...songs like ""Angry young man"", ""Goin' home"" and ""Dancing with my mirror""(all from the 1986 release FIELDS OF FIRE), ""Truth will set you free"" (from 1988's YOUNG MAN RUNNING)or even ""Hold on"" (included on the Beverly Hills Cop 2 sdtk.)are missing.On the brighter side, wonderful songs like ""It ain't enough"",""In your soul"", ""Never surrender"" are all here. The obvious ""Sunglasses at night"" is here too.All in all, a great collection of singles and well-written pop music. If you don't know that much about Corey Hart's work, this is a good start. But, take an advice from this guy, go after the other tiltes...they are worth it...trust me!!!And if you wanna check how his music has developed,look for hisATTITUDE AND VIRTUE (1992), COREY HART (1997), nad most recently JADE (1998). You won't be disappointed."
5,Where has this album been?,"I heard song after song that I loved on Pandora, and kept noticing so many of them were all on this CD. So I clicked once on the Pandora Amazon link, and a second time on the one click purchase Amazon link. And two days latter I had it! And there were even more songs on it that I hadn't yet heard that I really like. I noticed this was produced over 10 years ago!? How could I have missed this all this time!?Grandpa! I love the internet! Thank you for giving me such a glorious world where all this is possible!"
3,Too Many $$$,"An elegant little light when it works (got several; had to return two beaucse they were overheating) and, becuse they are so unobtrusive and slim, they are espcially good for small spaces that need focused light but not obvious lamps. (like bookcases). However, I discovered too late but maybe you won't : Ikea has almost identical lamps at a fourth of the price."
3,Great design but unreliable,"My first Robi failed after a couple of months' use. The company was very prompt about replacing it. The second one failed after about a year of use and it was not a bulb failure. I loved the design of this lamp and found the light output to be as good as any desk halogen lamp I have had, but for the price paid I expected better reliability. It's cooler-looking but no more reliable than a halogen lamp costing one-third what I paid."
2,Not much of use,The book I received was an old one and it had hardly any information that would be useful if you want to join school now.
2,very specific,"I think this book is really good for someone who has toyed with the idea of graduate school long after they've finished their undergraduate degree or while in high school. However, if you are currently in college, this book is superfluous to knowledge you should gain in senior level courses."
5,Really helpful and covers everything!,"This book is a really great addition to any students collection of resources for getting into graduate school (even if it is the only one you buy). True, much of the information can be obtained from other sources (such as websites), but it is ALL there, well organized in one little book! I would recommend using multiple sources in your search for the best way to get into whatever program you are applying for, but this book should probably be included. Has great explanations of all types of issues you might confront when looking at applying to graduate school. Great advice and timelines for the undergraduate years, whether you are a freshman or a senior starting to think about graduate school (but start early if you can).Good luck getting in!!!"
2,Canon Z180U,"I purchased this bag recently for my Canon Z180U and although it was nice and good quality, I was disappointed to see that it is a tight fit and that's the reason I rated it low.I should have thought before on how could they make a bag for all these cameras when the zoom is totally different, thus size of camera.When I contacted Canon to see what options I had, they said this bag is the only thing and somewhat agreed with my complaint."
2,A short and disappointing rehash not worth the money,This is an expensive and I found pretentious little book which offers little new. I say pretentious as it says that it will be different and that it will explain why so few British soldiers so far from support could defeat the much larger army that they did. Having set himself this task the author then fails to deliver and provides instead simply another potted biography. Not much original here. Four out of ten.
1,The design engineers were stoned,"The concept of this is great, but the engineering to back it up stinks. In order to lauch you have to go too slow to get the car to go around. If you try to get the car to go faster, then it flies of the loop before having a chance to go around the track.DH spent 2 hours trying to get the right touch using 20-25 different cars and only got it to work 2 times. Those 2 times were great but not enough reward for 2 hours of trying and not something my 6 year old will have the patience for. It has been returned to the store.Thank goodness I also got the re-release of the Hot Wheels Sizzler track and extra cars. Mattel made up for the Terrordactyl disaster with a fantastic nostalgic toy."
1,TOY DOESN'T WORK - just like last year's Hotwheels toy,"Just like the Mattel Hotwheels product we bought last year, this toy didn't work. We had to explain to our son that Santa's elves must have been rushing when they made this so that he wasn't too disappointed that Santa brought him something that didn't work. Next time he asks for Mattel toys, I'll explain that Mattel sells poorly made products, and that we're sticking with Playmobil."
1,Waste of Money,"My son was so excited to receive this for christmas, but imagine his disappointment when after we put it together, it wouldn't work. It is near impossible to launch the cars, and when it finally does launch, it can't even make it half way around the track. The pterdactyl is a wind up toy that lasts maybe 15 seconds, but you can send it flying by pushing a button. And it flys right into the launching mechanism, not into the other cars. I expected a better quality product from Hot Wheels for that kind of money."
1,"bad, bad, bad mattel","I agree with the other reviewer. This is a product that the staff at Mattel should be embarrased of. The launching system is a disaster, my guess is that they tried to reuse it from another failed product. It doesn't work.I am a mechanical engineer with 20 years of experience. I have a good friend with similar credentials. At first we thought the launching system was put together backwards. It broke the first day. It's going back. Kids really don't like getting presents that they get to play with for one day.The website is no help. This feature doesn't work yet, that feature doesn't work yet. Why bother when the product doesn't either.Do not buy this product."
1,Bad product,"The only thing in the whole set that was even close to being enjoyable for my son is the Terrordactyl. The launching system for the cars is unsat to say the least. Its very unstable, to complicated, and creates more work than fun. This product was a complete waste of MONEY. The complete set is cheaply made. And to top off all the disappointment it ONLY came with ONE car. Mattel/Hotwheel need to look at quailty in there products not QUANITY!"
5,What a reunion!,"It was interesting to see Barbara Stanwyck star with her ex-husband Robert Taylor in this excellent William Castle production. The acting is wonderful and would be expected from these two consummate actors. The eerie spell her ""dreams"" elicit really do work for me. It was an enjoyable view from my couch. I look forward to doing it again."
3,"Creepy camp shocker has hoots, howls and thrills","I first saw this gem on TV in the mid 1970s on a Saturday afternoon. It frightened me as a child and fascinates me as an adult. Another in a string of William Castle shockers, this film has a great performance from Barbara Stanwyck along with plenty of cheesy thrills and campy dialogue as only Castle can deliver (""When I'm awake with you my life is like a nightmare!""). Memorable music adds to the spell. The recent horror hit ""House of Wax"" pays homage to ""The Night Walker"" in a key scene. Why isn't this on DVD?"
4,Great book for beginners,"The book is very well written for its purpose. It may indeed fill the pages, but it does it well. Highly recommended for readers newly interested in the subject"
1,"Terribly written, convoluted aimless narrative",Poorly written narrative accompanied by a lot of meaningless illustrations used merely to fill out pages. No depth. No continuity. Merits zero stars.You'll no doubt find this in the bargain bins at your local book store - and rightfully so.
3,"Good, but not my favorite",I have purchased several other puzzles from this company that we have really liked. The puzzles are all of a sturdy construction and well made. This particular one just doesn't seem as interesting. Perhaps it is because there is not as much color or distinction between the various parts of the puzzle. My son tends to get frustrated and abandon it. There are better puzzles of the United States out there.
4,Cultural Diversity in Education,"Every educator should read this book. It is not only well written but hits at the center of how we can work with students and parents of diverse cultures. It is an attempt to give teachers and parents keys to understanding the socialization of different cultures so they can work together for the benefit of their children. As a culturally diverse county becoming more and more diverse, many students are being left out of the so called ""American dream"" by not getting the tupe of education that the privileged have so that they are left behind. It will take more than the ""No Child Left Behind"" to mend the fencds of our diverse culture and secure a good education for all children."
1,Cheap Paper and only partially recycled,"This paper is rather cheap paper. It is only a 20lb paper so it is very thin (good paper is 24lbs). The lower the weight, the thinner the paper and the more likely it is to jam up in your machine.Also, this paper is only 30% recycled content. Anything below 50% is a waste because it takes more energy to process and recycle the paper as it saves. Then mix that with new paper from freshly killed trees and you are just as bad as regular paper.If you are looking for good eco-friendly paper there is a paper made from sugar cane stalks. It is called CaneFields paper and it is really high quality. They don't sell it on Amazon anymore but you can write Canfields USA and find a local store.If you have to have wood pulp paper Mohawk makes a GREAT paper that they sell here on AmazonMohawk 100% Recycled Color Copy/Laser Paper, 96 Brightness, 28 lb, Letter Size (8.5 x 11), 500 Sheets (54-301)"
1,Description is inadeqaute,I thought I was buying 100% recycled paper but this was only 30% recylced. The description should be more detailed and accurate.
2,OK......I Guess,"Well, truth be told, I am a die hard Barbara Michaels fan (aka. Elizabeth Peters). I exausted my Barbara books and decided to switch to one of her Elizabeth Peters novels. Since I didn't want to get into a whole series like the Peabody series or what not, I picked this book.What a let down!!! OK, it kept my intrest and wasen't a total waste of time, but the story was predictable from the middle of the book. Maybe even the beginning. Normaly when I read one of her books I feverishly tear through the last 20 pages or so. Yeah, this one contained the quintessential explination and the ""wrap up"", but there was no basis to it. I came to the last page and thought THATS IT, you gotta be kidding me."
5,Excellent account of Seventies film,"Of the volumes in the excellent History of the American Cinema series, this is the best by far. Cook provides a superb, balanced overview of the film industry in the 1970s, considering practically every aspect of the topic--from the economics of the industry to the production trends to even the distribution and innovations in film technology. For any serious student of film history, this is a must read!"
5,Recommended for movie buffs and film historians.,"David A. Cook's volume Lost Illusions contributes Volume 9 to the ongoing History of the American Cinema series, covering the period from 1970-79 when American cinema operated against the social conditions of Vietnam and Watergate. The rise of film conglomerates is charted along with new filmmaking techniques."
5,Classic,"As a child, listened to this beautiful classy, jazzy Christmas album by Lena Horne everyday during the holidays. I have been trying to find this album for over 10 years and wow it was on Amazon. I had to have it and I enjoyed it! Brought back my childhood memories. Thank you Amazon you are the best!"
1,"My copy of CD skips, may be defective...","Sadly, at the beginning of the holiday season I put this CD in and almost cried when it skipped and showed signs of a defective CD. After the holidays I will put the CD back in again after cleaning it and see if it works. If it still skips, I will return it with my receipt for a refund. What a disappointment. I was really looking forward to listening to Lena Horne during the holidays! I am hoping for the best--that after cleaning it works beautifully and I can keep it!"
2,Not much to this book,"I am always looking for books that have girl heroes , Most books for toddlers are about boys doing great things. This book looked good but my 3 year old daughter did not even stay with it on the first read. I have already given it away."
3,Pirate Girl Blues,I have mixed reviews about this book so I rated it somewhere in the middle. The premise is good but the vocabulary sometimes is a bit much for the age group and the illustrations are definitely lacking. The idea of a girl pirate is refreshing but not when she's kidnapped and threatened to be fed to the sharks!
5,Great Product a must,My grandmother had the calendar when I was growing up. I still love the product to this day and have passed it on to my kids.
4,Good All Purpose Paper,"The paper is a bit on the thin side and not a bright white. When held up to my other paper the quality difference is obvious. I would buy it again to use for all purpose paper, but if you are looking to print something nice, use a better weight and brightness."
4,Convenient and effective,"I'm the only wine drinker in my household, so the Winekeeper is a real must-have for me. It does a great job of keeping wine fresh all week, allowing me to have a glass or two when I feel like it. I use this for everything from everyday table wine to expensive collectibles from the cellar.The only drawback in my opinion is that this system isn't terribly attractive. There are certainly fancier solutions on the market, but at this price point I'm totally satisfied."
2,Not the best...,"Although this book certainly has artistic merit, I would not have called it the ""Best of"". We have visited the area many times and are well aware of the various terrains. In some cases, the photographer seemed to choose the ""ugliest of"" and in even more cases, the photos could have been taken anywhere - there was nothing to indicate a particular location. Examples would be an animal running across an empty field. Fine if you're looking for nature, not very useful if you are trying to identify ""Best of""/beautiful spots to visit. This was a gift for my husband and he was not very impressed..."
4,"ANOTHER SIDE OF FRED ASTAIRE-IF YOU ARE A COLLECTOR OF FRED ASTAIRE MOVIES YOU WILL WANT THIS ONE, TOO!",THIS SHOWS ANOTHER TYPE OF CHARACTER FRED ASTAIRE PLAYS. NOT AS MUCH DANCING AS SOME OF THE OTHER MOVIES. BUT IF YOU COLLECT ASTAIRE MOVIES YOU WILL WANT THIS ONE IN YOUR COLLECTION. I GIVE IT 4 STARS.
3,He is not always very well inspired,"Fred Astaire does it again in the context of WW2, in which he is a pilot. During a ten days' leave, he goes on his own in some city and seduces a photographer, a lady mind you. The film is the story of this seducing episode with all kinds of complications with her boss who is in love with her but gallantly yields, with his fellow pilots who try to inject some pepper into the situation, and with the plane industrialist who does not know anything about flying his own planes and the difficulties or dangers such an action may imply and contain. What's more there is little dancing, for once. The photographer will only discover who Fred Astaire is in the very few minutes when he is to leave. Romantic and kind of simplistic. And this is not made up by the sudden angry dancing spell in which Fred Astaire destroys a great number of glasses and even some mirrors in a ritzy bar.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,Fred Astaire as Gene Kelly,"This movie surprised me a lot. It wasn't what I expected at all. I was on a Fred Astaire kick and was viewing many of his early movies. When I came to this one, I saw a Fred that I hadn't seen before. Then it hit me... Fred Astaire was playing a Gene Kelly part. Imagine Kelly in this role! Fred Astaire seemed to have one ""gimmicky"" dance in many of his movies and the wonderful bar dance was this picture's gimmic. But it was an athletic dance that you'd expect from Gene Kelly. Not to say I didn't like the movie. I liked it a lot. The bar dance (to One More for the Road) was great. Benchley's dinner speech was so funny and is one scene that I'd like to show in public speaking classes for a lesson on how NOT to give a speech."
4,On demand prints have low quality and no chapter menu,"To save stocking fees (I guess) Amazon prints some of these (more obscure) DVDs after an order is placed. This is great because it makes the DVD accessible. However, the print quality is just acceptable and there are no special features included. More importantly and frustrating about the print ""on demand"" DVDs is that they do not include a chapter menu where one can go directly to a specific scene if necessary."
5,Clymer Yamaha Road Star repair mannual,"Received book very fast and is in very good condition, new. It is just what I was looking for. Would buy from this vendor again."
2,Looks nice if I could only use it.,"I got this as a wedding gift from a friend and when I got it it was broken. I called to get a replacement and they were nice enough to send a second one. I was anxiously waiting and when i got it, it was broken again! I was really disappointed because I was not able to get it replaced for the third time and they told me to keep it (""for security reasons"", what????) and they just gave me my money back. So now it has just been sitting in my closet. So sad. I wish I could use it but because it didn't come in tact both times now I can't use it."
2,Its been cut!,"I saw this film under its alternative title of ""The Unspeakable"" on cable. This version has quite a number of cuts toward the end, so if you've seen the final scene with Athena Massey on cable, it won't be here.Other than looking at the incomperable Athena Massey with the less than usual amounts of clothes on, this film is the usual psycho fare. The twist is supposed to be that Massey's psycho cop boyfriend is to be compared to the thoughtful philosophical slasher, with us coming down on the side of the slasher. Unfortunatley, cutting Massey's final scene definatley makes this much less valuable than it would have otherwise been.Conclusion: Don't bother. Massey fans: Get her film Undercover instead, its much better."
4,good pruning blades,"not as fast as a chain saw, but safer, and work very well with my dewalt cordless reciprocating saw to cut off small limbs of trees up to about 4 or 5 inches."
4,Limited Results on Small Branches,"The blades are high quality, but are better suited to cutting branches 1"" or larger that are not flexible. Smaller flexible branches get caught between blade teeth. The blades are indeed very sharp, so handle carefully with gloves and don't store them loose in your sawzall case."
1,Are you kidding me?,"How this movie has the high average rating it has makes absolutely no sense. It looks so promising in the trailer, but what a let down. Sloooooow, poorly written, stiffly acted, and not a whiff of wit to it. Just awful. Takeshi Kitano has a cult following among fans of Japanese gangster films, and I can picture him in that role. But a previous comedian? That's harder to swallow. After watching this mish mash, I understand why he left comedy. Considering how much of the film focuses solely on Kikujiro (Kitano) and the young boy, one would expect to feel a sense of affection between them by the film's end. One would be wrong. Rather, the two characters remain flat, and the dragging hours involve weirdly violent incidents, awkward attempts at comedy, and shameless, fruitless attempts at pulling the viewer's heartstrings. A disappointment all around."
5,Beautiful Work,"I have seen Brother, which included Takeshi Kitano, and I loved him in that film. But after renting this movie from Blockbuster, I will definitely buy it to have as part of my Japanese movie collection.Takeshi (Kikujiro) played a brilliant role as a man of all sorts of emotions and actions which made me feel bad for him at times, and for others in different moments. The connection between him and the little boy (Masao) was very real and touching. The plot, though at times a little slow, was still cute and sentimental. The music, the acting, the story, the whole package was amazing when I decided to see it for the first and third time. I suggest this film to any person who enjoys a nice story without minding the subtitles. My little brother who hates subtitles also fell in love with the film!"
5,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!,"This was funny funny funny!! Hard to believe that such a film was made by director known in the states for more ""hard-hitting"" action films. For some, it will seem a little long and a tad slow, however, I thought the dialog alone negated those ""faults"". It has a sort of ""Life is Beautiful"" feel to it and Kitano tries to ""paint"" his scenes rather than just film them. Not everyone's cup of tea but they should at least take a sip!!"
2,Simply Terrible,"Anyone who has read my reviews or seen my listmania list knows im a huge fan of gothic horror. As for this one, save your money for something better. The dubbing was horrific and i had a hard time understanding what the characters were saying. The movie was hard to follow (perhaps because i could'nt understand what was being said) and very slow moving. It was very hard to get through this one."
1,IGNORE AT ALL COSTS,"ignore this movie at all costs! ignore the title this movie hs nothing to do with zombies what so ever. its just a mix up of volent scenes put together in so many confusing orders. dont buy this movie unless you want the whole 'weird' zombie set. its code named tha because there's two sets of zombie films. this set is not the set to Lucio Fulci's masterpiece ""Zombie"" oh no it isn't. my advice ignore this [one] and move on."
5,"Petite, but great for kids","My daughter doesn't stop playing with her normal stud earings and often twists them on their retainer bar making them difficult to remove. We got these for her and while they are basic in design, and small in size!! they are perfect for her small ears and no more stuck earings..."
4,Just what I was looking for,"These earrings are just what I was looking for, but couldn't find in any local store. They are very small, so be certain they will fit ahead of time by measuring precisely. The only problem I had was actually fastening them in my ears. Once fastened, however, they will stay clasped together. It took me about a 1/2 hour to get them fastened! Would recommend however..."
4,Cute but Small,This earring is surprisingly TINY. In the picture they look a lot bigger. They are really meant for a new born or a barbie doll. But they look very nice as a tragus ring though. The claps is kinda difficult to connect but still a good product
3,Very pretty but too small for my little ears!,"Very pretty/shiny earrings but way too small for my ears and my ears are pretty small. These earrings are for a child plain and simple, easy to put in if these things fit your ears, everyone who had trouble putting these on barely made the cut! Would be easy to put on a child since they are sized for one. Other than not fitting, I love them!! Would wear them everyday if they fit me, I'm giving them to a friends 5 yr old daughter :)"
1,dont do it!!,so small a child couldnt even wear these. unable to open the clasp they were so small. Dont do it!!
1,don't buy!,"PLEASE don't buy these earrings, thought they are the perfect size for stacking them all the way up your ears they are junk, they break as soon as you get them or they wont close right. very pretty but not even worth $2.00!!"
1,Unwatchable. Headache inducing MTV style camera work.,It truly was unwatchable due to the frantic video cuts. It is apparent they do want to sell you the dvd but they don't want you to see the show. Don't be a sucker and buy any of the Cirque dvds but do catch the live shows.
4,"Good show, odd choice for only Blu-Ray","Corteo is not what you might first expect from Cirque Du Soleil. While there are some of the same great trademark theatrics and acrobatics, this one tells much more of a story than the rest. The story is quite well told of a clown who dreams of his own funeral. The part of the clown is acted quite well, and the scenes were very captivating.Overall, this is not my favorite Cirque Du Soleil performance as it lacks some of the ""Oooh and Ahh"" factor of some of the others. (This makes me wonder why Corteo is the only one available on Blu-Ray) Nonetheless, it was a very entertaining watch that Cirque fans will surely enjoy."
3,Must have for your Cirque collection,"This dvd is a must have for any fan of the Cirque - Corteo has a rather different approach to their past few shows - Costuming is very romantic, and their choice of language (italian, and english) makes this performance a lot more easier to relate to... The story line and messages are a lot simpler to interpret than a lot of other Cirque shows; and whilst some of the acts are familiar (juggling, the use of the fast-track, the high-wire) these acts still never cease to amaze and fascinate..."
2,So slow show,"I like so much Cirque du Soleil (CdS) Shows. This is the first DdS Show that I feel that is very slow, in fact my children who love Cirque du Soleil were bored. The performances are not as amazing as other performances in other Cirque du Soleil shows (for instance VAREKAI)."
1,"Bad sound mix, bad picture","While this was definitely a recording of the stage show, Cirque has done much better. The show's production (lighting and smoke) were not modified to suit filming, resulting in a difficult-to-watch picture. They also had excessive bass for the first half of the disc - a near-consistent very low tone permeated the hour of the disc I could tolerate. I like bassy recordings, but this just made my ears hurt. Knowing what I know now, I'd not have purchased this disc."
1,It's only a commercial for the show,"I love the Cirque du Soleil - I enjoy their Allegria DVD, and especially the Varekai DVD. The cinematography was superb - the acts are all shown.Corteo was a new one - came to Chicago but I couldn't go, so I bought the DVD.DISAPPOINTING!It was a commecial for Corteo, not a video of the Cirque's performances in Corteo. Almost 1/2 the disc consisted of 'audience reaction' - not a single Cirque act was shown.If I buy any more, they will be year 2003 or before"
2,Disappointed,"I was hugely disappointed with this. I saw Corteo early on, and I thought it was amazing. I was really excited to see it again on DVD, but right when it started something felt wrong. When I had seen it live, it created a very touching and beautiful mood with the performances, music, and costumes. Now, everything was being awkwardly narrated. The concept of the show was just bluntly explained right at the beginning. It made me cringe a little. The music had all been changed. Where before it felt like you were inside of this mans melancholic dream, it now felt wacky and silly. When, ""these kids are jumping on their parents bed"" was narrated, followed by a relentless slide whistle, I just couldn't take it too seriously anymore.It feels like it was seriously dumbed down for a wider audience. Makes me very sad. Two stars because the performances themselves are of course still amazing. It's just the show as a whole that's been ruined."
3,for the kids,My kids did not enjoy Corteo as much as I thought they would. Maybe the storyline is a little less enagaging then other Cirque shows.
2,"Good show, bad video","I had the opportunity to see Corteo on tour, and enjoyed it immensely. The latter cannot be said for the DVD of the production. Apaprently the camera crew was unable to deal with the ""two-faced"" stage of Corteo - about one third of the time, the performers are facing AWAY from the camera, and you, the viewer, will be looking at the backs of the performers far more often than you would have if you were just sitting in the chapiteau.The bonus features are worth a look, so perhaps renting this DVD rather than buying it is the preferable option. With the video composition as it is, you will not want to watch this DVD twice."
1,warehouse labelling problem with this item,"Potential buyers please be aware!! There is a problem at the warehouse with these cases, TWICE I was sent the wrong product with the ""correct"" label. The Amazon barcode sticker on the back of the item reads for ""iPod 4G and iPod Photo"", but what you actually recieve is a case for iPod MINI, the packaging of the product states that clearly on the front made for iPod MINI. Amazon tried to resolve it and sent me another case with the exact same issue: 4G & Photo barcode on the back, and the actual product is for MINI, when I explained the situation the second time I was advised that they would have to further research the problem and could not provide the product.I have other Speck cases and they are great, but if you want this one for your 4G or Photo iPod, I'd watch out."
3,Does the job,The wheel protector is a plastic add-on that makes operating your Ipod impossible while its attached. The toughskin is so thick and bulky that your Itrip will not fit unless you break out a knife and scissors like I did. Only took me a few minutes to cut off enough excess to make it fit. The toughskin is rubber and thick but not so thick that it makes the Ipod awkard or weird. The belt clip is useless. It just spins like crazy. Not a bad product but I really wish they had said it was not compatiable with the Itrip. Nevertheless it will protect your Ipod if you drop it and thats what matters.
2,Toughskin for IPOD,"I ordered this item and it is extremely overpriced, it's made in China, for $1 and sells for $30. The belt clip has already broke after about 1 months use. In order to use the ITrip it had to be cut to accodomodate the Itrip. It does protect the IPOD well but it cheaply made."
1,Less than impressed - robbed of $30,"I have a 30G IPod photo. Yes, this case DOES fit the 30G, but you have to use this crummy plastic spacer to fill up all of the extra space inside. This case easily doubled the width of my IPod and made it heavier. I could have just tied some old pillows around it and saved myself the $30. (That's how big it seems with the case on) There's no way that the screen saver and wheel cover are going to last - they are not really secured in any significant fashion. They will get lost. The thumb wheel cover should open from the bottom, not from the top. It's also not the bright blue color like in the photo. It's more like a washed out blue gummy-worm color."
2,NOT THRILLED,DOES NOT FIT THE IPOD CLASSIC VERY WELL...SORT OF LOOKED A LITTLE BIG ON IT AND SO IT KEPT SLIDING AROUND IN THE CASE
3,"Spacious, not always a good thing","The product is tough and durable, but there is space between my iPod and the case, and I don't like the ""one size fits all"" fit of the case. Other than that, the shipping was much quicker than expected and it's keeping my iPod from dirt and grime."
4,Good Looks - Acceptable Function,"The La Crosse Weather Station has excellent looks and works well. However, the outside temperate regulary drops out especially in cold weather. Overall I'm happy with the form and satisfied with the function."
4,Courageous!,"As with his 5-Star autobiography, ""Makes Me Wanna Holler"", (which I highly recommend), Nathan McCall commits himself to a literary style that bears no concern for ""political correctness"", thus enabling him to speak. I have a great deal of respect for Nathan's literary candor which firmly resonates in the first three chapters of ""What's Going On"" - [The Revolution is About Basketball], [Airing Dirty Laundry], and [Men: We Just Don't Get It]. Most people would shun from expressing their opposing views on issues that are favored by a majority sector. This is not the case with Nathan - he is a daring writer who tells it the way he sees it, thus such honesty is what separates the boys from the men.Yvonne Grays - author of ""Working in the Dark"""
4,Fascinating and Erudite,"I was happy to find McCall's latest book, having thoroughly enjoyed--and learned a lot from--Makes Me Wanna Holler. It's evident from his writing that he has thought long and hard about these issues.On a few occasions, I disagreed with his analysis. For example, the woman on the elevator could just as easily have been apprehensive because he was an unknown man, rather than specifically an unknown black man. Gender can be just as powerful an issue as race in today's society. Or perhaps he was simply projecting his own impression on to her, and she wasn't concerned at all.Still, McCall brings important issues to light, and his combination of experience and research brings powerful support to many of his arguments."
4,Who's packing these?,"Whole Foods Inc. tried to charge me $77 for this exact bottle until I looked it up on Amazon for under $30. All is well, product is great but who ever is packing this stuff up to ship just doesn't understand what they're doing. Item was fortunate to make it without breaking."
2,Nasty-Tasting and Hard-To-Swallow.,"Here's my thoughts on this product been on it about a week now.The coating used on these taste terrible and leaves an after-taste!Was hoping for an energy rush,but left me,not too tired either.Wouldn't buy these again i don't like them at all because of what I've experienced."
1,Crap! and CRAPPER!!,"This absolutely sucked. I couldn't stand it. Right from the start I knew this was gonna be bad but I said, hey what the hell, let's give it go. Of course I should have listened to meself the first! I would not recomemed to pre-schoolers. J.Roberson should really give a rest. I give her a star for effort (grunt!!) but not much else..""Hoolies, my god those HOOLIES!!"""
3,Fun Little Indie Thriller/Black Comedy,"Fun little indie thriller/black comedy about Will, a depressed, underground comic book writer (the late David Strickland) who works as a pizza delivery boy. His tape recorder - filled with the possible demises of his characters - lands in the hands of a charming serial killer (the consistently excellent Ron Eldard) - and the ensuing murders look to be remarkably similar to those ""fantasized"" about on tape by Will.Most cinematic killers are portrayed as outcasts, loners, confused so its refreshing to see Eldard attack his role with a vigor and joy in menacing terror not unlike (though much more toned tone) Jim Carrey's Cable Guy.While decidedly having a B movie feel about it Delivered's cast delivers the goods, and seem to believe in their characters and make it work. I've seen pictures with far, far bigger budgets not provide half the entertainment Delivered does. Cheap and Fun."
4,An amazing read,"Although Kazan plays a little with biographical information for an actual historical person, this book is an enjoyable read. It is a glimpse into a world that is both long gone (the Ottoman empire, gone for nearly 100 years) and is yet still here today (a repressive (though slightly less than some modern ones) Islamic land). That Halide has a father who's willing to defy convention and give her a well-rounded education is remarkable. You cheer as Halide grows into a well-educated woman who may be shy but forges ahead in life, becoming a novelist, wife, and ultimately mother. I found all the characters in the novel likeable, a rare feat with me. I'd recommend this book to people to get a different view of Arabic life."
2,Not The Greatest,"This was not the book I expected. Its plot is weak and its characters were poorly developed. The plot holds together in a rag-tag sort of way, but there are a lot of small plotlines that went nowhere. The book was a disappointing read because it was not so much about Halide's Gift, as it was about the series of events occuring in her life. Halide was a boring character, perhaps one of the blandest in the book, especially so considering that she is the protagonist, although there is no real conflict or problem in the theme."
4,"Congratulations, Mrs. Kazan!","This book was written by someone who cares deeply about women's rights and their lack in Ottoman Turkey at the turn of the century. The attitude is objective and the tone full of love for characters that are of such a different road of life from the author's. Having elements of both the Orient and the Occident in her upbringing and personality, Halide was one of the first Turkish girls to attend a school which has contributed tremendously to the enlightenment of Turkish women -- namely The American College for Girls, of which I am a graduate myself...I'd like to correct a couple of minor details, though.. The mosque in Scutari is called Mihrimah, and I've never heard the name Mamounia [Edip's third wife]... Another point is that in those days it was not usual for women to go to mosques, even for funerals. Otherwise it's obvious that a thorough research went into the preparations for this book."
3,Not quite what I expected but still a good read,"I agree with those who say that this book didn't really match its description. I thought it was going to be more in the vein of ""magical realism"" (like Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabel Allende) in terms of explaining Halide's ""gift"". Instead this was only a very small and minor part of the development of the story. I also thought that the story would be told using Halide's voice or at least her point of view (from a woman's perspective). A lot more time was devoted to the male characters than I would have expected and this seemed to take away the focus from the important female characters who I would have liked to learn more about. It was an enjoyable book to read simply because it took place in a time and place that I know little about, but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations."
1,What Gift?,"A richer, fuller story could have been told by a better writer. All of the characters and settings required for a great story are here, but the narritive left me wanting more. Ms. Kazan obviously has ties to the publishing world due to her marriage to the famed director. This book fails as a drama because I didn't care aboout any of the characters as they held no special interest for me because they were so one-dimentional and Halide never realizes her ""gift"". The book dosen't really hang together. You can find something else better to read... try just about anything."
1,It's so so,"There are a lot of books out there to help you cope with turning 50. I know. I have ordered them. Of all those books, this one was the least helpful. It does list a whole lot of things to do ""now that you're 50."" But there's nothing innovative or inspiring that you can't think of, yourself. It lists things anyone can do at any age. Many of those things involve having lots of money to invest. The title should read, ""Things To Do Now that You're a Millionaire."" The pages are thick and glossy. Maybe to catch your drool, if you are drooling at 50. There is one, maybe two, suggestions per page. I guess I was looking for something with a little more humor. For such an unimaginative book, it takes itself way too seriously. I do not recommend this book."
3,A pretty good magazine with a Canadian slant,I sometimes read this magazine and I'm from Canada; it's a pretty good book with a good Canadian slant towards topics.
4,This one's good,"I really enjoyed this book. It was funny, sexy, and the problems the main character go through are hysterical. Case in point, she follows one of her clients throughout her ""date"" (to prevent the serial killer from striking again,) hears strange muffled noises coming from the bedroom goes to investigate, and embarassingly discovers it's just a little bit of the rough 'n tumble. I didn't feel that the author was trying to pull a mary janice davidson- I think that's a little bit of a stretch. There actually was more plot to sink your teeth into. hehehe"
1,"Dull, dull, dull!","Its a Betsy rip-off & not a very good one at that (granted the Betsy series has tanked the last few books). I really was looking forward to a new vamp series but this one isn't it. How many times do I have to read about a ""designer"" shoe, outfit, etc. Who cares???? Give me a story with likeable characters that are interesting ~ not so one-dimensional. Definitely not reading the next one."
2,Tries to hard to be Davidson,"An inferior rip off of Mary Janice Davidson's Wed books. If she just toned down the Sex in the City dingbat -Chick Lit silliness the book might have actually been interesting. Too much about the clothing,shoes, shopping. Avoid paying full price"
1,"""What can I say?""","The title for this review is my primary reason for hating this novel. It's only the dread of reading those four words yet again that has stopped me from going back through the book and counting the extraordinary number of times this phrase was used. It's not witty catch phrase, nor is it quirky, it's just very lazy writing. Ditto the unnecessary descriptions of garments with 'aspirational' labels - product placement in movies is one thing, but this was just boring to read, and smelled suspiciously of author hoping to cash in. The majority of characters were thinly devised and one dimensional. But the worst part of this book is that there are flashes of really good work, but it seems the rush to push out product (no doubt to top up the handbag fund) resulted in a poorly finished job.MJD's Undead series is light, funny froth. This isn't."
2,"Disappointing ""Betsy"" Knock-Off","Raye writes like she's trying to sound like MJ Davidson's main character Betsy Taylor (Undead and Unwed, et al.). I found this a very weak story with not-terribly-interesting characters. It's Sex and the City with vamps, and both Candace Bushnell and MaryJanice Davidson produced better writing and characters than Kimberly Raye has with this book.However, I have not given up, and will cautiously read Raye's next installment in this series. I hope that she will grow into herself and her characters, and not try to be someone else."
2,Wouldn't Recommend It,"I just finished this book and in comparison to the other vamp, demon, magical romance books that I have recently read by (Kenner, Hallaway, and Swenson) this book pales in comparison. I will not be reading the next book of the series."
1,CrackerJack3 or ahhh what's the use!,"I was going to write a review but hell, why waste my time. I would never recomend this movie to anyone I like. With 1000's of new movies out every year why would anyone be interested in this one? My recomendation... don't watch it on a full stomach."
5,Great gloves,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. They are very comfortable with no breaking in required. The company was very quick to deliver.
5,Very Soft....,Gloves were shipped very quickly and arrived in 3 days. The medium size was perfect for me and I did not want a lined pair as my hands get too hot. I was looking for driving gloves and these work fine.
4,Most excellent...,There's no problem in recommending this CD.An excellent mix of the past and present sounds of straight ahead jazz.
4,Nice but hot,"This product works great, but the units tend to get warm or even hot. Not something you want to feel plugged into your outlets."
1,It simply works extremeley slow,"I wasted my money and the device is sitting on my shelf.The powerline does not work in my ACER new model loaded with windos vista. I had a service call fromm ATT and they could not do nothing either.It works when I connect it to DirecTV for ""on demand"" downloading movies, but it is so slow that it took two days to download a movie. So at least my experience is that I totally wasted my money."
1,unacceptable,"Was unable to get more than ~300Kpbs download speed, despite advertised ""up to 85Mbps"". Home wiring and distance may be worse than average, but still, this sub-megabit performance is entirely unacceptable. Unlike WiFi, there are no obvious ""tricks"" (antenna location, etc.) to fiddle with to significantly improve performance - it's pretty much take it or leave it."
4,Works Great!,I bought two of these units to replace an older pair (much slower) home plug devices. The install was a snap and the configuration utility is easy to use.I am getting reliable 55 - 60 M bps across circuits and completely on the other side of a 2500 sq ft house.I recommend this product.
1,Not for all users,"I have bought 4 of these and have been dissappointed. I have recently relocated for work, and I have to sell my house where I was before buying here. All of that said I have been using Wireless G with bridges and I have been unhappy with the speed. I thought about Wireless N but as I would have to buy a new access point and bridges I thought I would try these devices.I am not happy with the speed at all. I live in a small (1000sqft) apt and my desktop is seperated from my server by one room. Copying a 3 GB file I have been averaging 2MB. I was getting better results over Wireless. I have read many good reviews with about this product, but I cannot recogmend it based on my experience."
3,Didn't reach nearly advertised speeds... yet,"I'll defintely modify this review once my replacement adapter comes in from Netgear.I used the 11mbps version of the Netgear powerline just fine, no issues, speeds were about 5-7mbps and saved me wiring up the house with Cat5.I jumped on these HDX101s and bought two. Easy to set-up and I took out the 11mbps versions and placed the HDX101s in the same sockets. The speeds were comparable to the 11mbps version. But that was when one of the adapters just started blinking green. (The manual only has 3 troubleshooting options and none helped here.) I called their support, got a RMA easily so that's nice.One thing I did notice is that this advertises 200mbps. But the ethernet connection on the powerline adapter is 100mbps. So even with a gigabit switch, how do you get 200mbps if the powerline itself throttles it down to 100mbps? Just something I noticed."
1,Poor performance,"I purchased these hoping to upgrade my powerline network, which uses the older Netgear XE102. Using XE102s, I get about 500 Kilobits/sec - way too slow. So, I anxiously plugged in my HDX101's, hoping to get at least 10-20 Megabits/sec. Instead, I get about 600 Kilobits/sec. :( Perhaps it's a problem unique to my electrical wiring, but...needless to say, I was very disappointed."
3,"Simple, easy, fast but issues when it rains","Very simple to setup, plug and play. I have an old house approx 50yrs old and I get 120-140 Mbps and yes it is fast. This is much better than WiFI and the dropouts I get with that. The only issue I have is that when it rains, the one down in the TV room goes out and loses connectivity.I guess they work well for me apart from the rain issue."
4,Delivers as promised,"Product works as promised. Internet speeds are shaky though - A receiver plugged in very close to the transmitter shows almost no drop in speeds. However another receiver plugged in the second floor shows almost a 50% drop in speeds. In any case, since I started with cable broadband internet speeds, the difference is minimal if any."
1,Do not buy this,"I purchased 5 of these for a group of people that work in our lab (total ~$1200). The first day I tried to use mine, a piece of plastic that holds the usb plug in the housing broke, and shortly thereafter, the entire plug pulled out easily, exposing the internals. It was within 30 days, so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement, which they shipped right away. The first time I went to use the new one, the same thing happened. It is still w/in 30 days, so I am looking to send all 5 back for refund."
1,Very poor workmanship and materials,"We purchased 21 of these. 20 out of the lot are defective. The Lightning ""Jump Drives"" have a rubber/plastic molding that holds the front and back of the jump drive together. The cap is built the same way. Upon removing the drives from the package, and removing the caps, most of them cracked and parts of the plastic fell off. We contacted Lexar (brush up on your Indian language skills before calling) and did not get anywhere with them..... I would NOT recommend buying from Lexar. We returned the products to PC Mall, and exchanged them for SanDisk Cruzer Titaniums. MUCH BETTER!"
2,Caution!,"The drive is speedy - no doubt about it. It had good features such as ability to create a secure and unsecure partition.But all its features are useless when the design of the product is flawed. As noted by others, the metal casing connects to a plastic (right around the USB connection). That can break no matter how careful you are. When you pull the drive out of a USB port, you are applying pressure to this plastic part and it's guaranteed to break at some point unless you're 100% careful all the time. It's extremely fragile!Having said that, I would not buy this drive if I had known this before."
5,Great Device,"I got this model because of it's size and speed. In fact, I got it after returning a cheaper 2GB CruzerMini which was just too slow for my liking (severals times slower than my older 256MB JumpDrive). This drive, despite the complaints others have had about it, has worked just find for me for nearly a year. It probably helps that I don't fling it around on a string, but instead carry it in a pocket or in my laptop bag."
5,speedy flash drive,"Okay the stainless steel housing may be gimmicky, but in terms of speed, it's the fastest flash drive I've used. I have a Lexar FireFly as well, and the Lightning seems at least 3-5X as fast."
5,Fast drive. Makes a great bootable usb drive.,"Given the broad spectrum of ratings for this item, maybe there were some QA issues at the factory.My 3 drives were fine.I am using these for BOOTABLE diagnostics, troubleshooting and surfing.Dropped an image file of Knoppix 5.5.1, made it bootable and it is really great for use as a bootable drive [on newer mobo, with BIOS that supports booting from a USB].Much faster boot than with Knoppix on a CD rom.Next project is a bootable jumpdrive with an OS that can read,repair XP.Third project, a virus scanner + anti-spyware jumpdrive, to clean infected systems."
3,I Hate multiple song versions!,"If you already have their EP Act One then you have heard 1/3rd of this album. Of course the repeated songs have been remade for this album, but not necessarily for the better. I think I Hate Kate is still trying to perfect their sound because it seems to differ from song to song and from the EP. At times it goes from modern rock to almost an 80's feel. Sort of like mixing Hoobastank with Duran Duran. It is a pretty good album regardless. So if you were a fan of Zebrahead then you just might like Justin's new band."
2,Size does matter,"The books are useful, but they are WAY smaller than I expected. Mini doesn't come into it - I actually thought the box was empty when I first recieved it. If i had known how small they were, I would not have bought them - its not great value for money. Although what little content there is, is really good."
4,Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss,"As a registered dietitian who counsels individuals for weight loss, I found this book to be an excellent tool. It emphasizes sound advice that anyone can easily incorporate into their own eating patterns to improve their diet. It's true that a picture is worth a thousand words. My clients are always amazed at how Dr. Shapiro's advice can really make sense."
2,VERY SMALL INDEED,"WHEN I ORDERED THIS I DIDNT EXPECT THE BOOKS TO BE SO MINI, I DIDNT REALIZE THAT THEY WOULD BE ULTRA SUPER MINI, THE INFORMATION IS GOOD, WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE INFORMATION OR MORE PICTURES. THESE ARE GREAT POCKET GUIDES, BUT THAT IS IT. IF YOU WANT ALL THE INFORMATION YOU WILL NEED TO GET THE BIG BOOK."
5,Love it...,"Very nice chair, workmanship is very good! The larger size is nice, and fits my 200# frame nicely. Super portable yet very comfortable to sit in."
4,Regular Guy,"When Guy, a young boy, begins to believe that his parents aren't really his parents, he has to investigate further. When he looks into the school records, he sees that the weirdest kid in school has the same birthday, and he now believes that they were swithced at birth.If you want to know how this story ends, find it in your public library today!"
4,Regular Guy,I think that this book is really interesting because it tells a lot of deatil and it is really good but if someone more advanceed they might not like it becaues it is not in there level. But i think that it is really good so read it.
5,My Guy,My guy is a very funny book for young readers. It held my attention when I read that Guy's mom was getting married. The dinner party disaster was hilarious. I liked how the author described the details and how she put kid language into the story.
3,Not that great,I didn't think that this was a good book. The characters were shallow. The plot was predictable from the beginning. I've read much better books with the same basic plot. This book was a disappointment.
2,Regular Guy,"Dont bother to read this book!The book I read last week wasRegular guy.I thought it was a poor book,it was really boring.the auther was Sarah Weeks she wrote dork in disguised.this book wasnt very good.The first part of the book.Guy the main characterthough he wasswitched at birth."
1,Buyer Beware,"This isn't a book. It is a high school report. 66 pages with huge amounts of spacing. Not much insight from someone who has 10+ years of experience.Also, until now I never understood the value of an editor. I do now since this book obviously didn't have one."
3,not bad,reconcilliation was real good not too bad theme was great i wuld recommend to buy not for younger group to view
5,Excellent,This film touches on so many topics. The debate regarding homosexuality is addressed very respectfully. I was very impressed with how the story shows how God can bring healing to people who deal with this debate and are able to find forgiveness with each other.
5,A MUST SEE MOVIE!!,"Beautiful story about broken relationships and the importance to forgive while you have the chance! Be encouraged by this incredible film to reconcile with a parent, child, sibling, friend, co-worker or whomever.I am a Christian and must say the quality of this film is one of the best I've seen in terms of acting, writing, directing, and message. Nothing cheesy. This film should have been in theaters!This film also discusses homosexuality, one of the most controversial and talked about issues around the world. I've never seen any film tackle the subject matter better. Pastors and congregations need to watch this film to better understand the topic of Grace, Love, Truth, Holiness and patience no matter the sin. Unbelievers need to watch this film to better understand the Gospel. Be prepared to be challenged and have a box of kleenex on hand as the tears will flow. WATCH THE ENTIRE FILM!!"
2,"Good paper, bad delivery","I got this ream of paper, but the package is broken, a corner of the ream was squeezed and distorted, nearly all papers' corners are distorted. How ever the quality of the paper is good, smooth and heavy. But I hate the delivery."
5,Hammermill Laser Print Paper,This is my favorite paper because of its whiteness and super smooth texture. I've used this type for many years and I would never switch to a different type or brand. This is truly a premium laser print paper. I also save lots of money by purchasing it through the Amazon Marketplace.
1,I could have bought torn packets from my neighbor!,"Product was in poor condition when received!! Paper packets were OPENED on one end. Some of the papers edges were dirty from the packaging being opended and handled. No i dont mean the outer packaging. I mean the paper packet itself! Both were open, wrinkled, dirty. The paper is useable but I had to over look the dirty marks on the edge."
2,Paper opened and ripped,I received the box and opened it to find all of the packaging of each ripped and opened. Very disappointing and unprofessional.
5,For 20 years this paper has proven itself,20 years ago I bought a HP Laserjet and the salesman recommended the use of Hammermill 24# paper to protect the mechanism from paper shards (the store also repaired these and had had a lot of repair business due to cheaper 20# being run through Laserjets). I have not had to repair the printer and the heavier weight paper also works great on my double-sided inkjet printer.
2,Good for Back Sleeping ONLY,"If you only sleep on your back then this pillow is great! However, once you try to lay on your side, the areas for side sleeping are as hard as a rock. I even bought the ""gentle"" pillow based on other reviews, but I found that this one just got more and more UNCOMFORTABLE while trying to sleep on my side. Unfortunately, another pillow tossed onto the ""dead shortly after arrival"" stack in my closet :-("
4,"Great picture for the $$, horrible sound...","I agree with everyone else, the sound really is horrible, but thats what you get out of these small LCD's. However, the screen was for our 5yr old son in his bedroom and the quality is more than enough for a kid his age. We will probably get the 27"" for our room, and upgrade the speakers. :)"
2,Expensive piece of Computer Monitor!!!,"I completely agree with the reviewer ""Sy5temgro0ve"". After 3 months of excellent usage, the LCD could only cycle through the monitor inputs and not the video or cable inputs.The worst part it since it was multiple voltage compatible i sent it to my country (220 watts) and after 3 days of operation it lost the TV/Video capability. Though i got it from bestbuy, i am stuck with it cause i need to bring it back to get it replaced. Not worth the pain. Now it is sitting in my home as a overpriced computer monitor.But overall it is a good piece of technology with great feature, wish it works though."
3,Sound - what sound?,I have a Westinghouse 42 in my living room and bought this one for my home gym...the speakers are horrible. The picture quality is good. You're going to have to buy speakers.The TV was a nice one - I had it for awhile and moved it into my bedroom in a new home. Speakers obviously change the entire dynamic of this TV. I gave it to my parents who needed a computer monitor for theirs that died.I'd probably buy it again.
4,"Chalked full of features, but fell short on audio capability.","This TV/Monitor is great for the price. I bought this for about $179 from TigersDirect (after various discounts). I use this as a TV and the picture quality is spectacular, A+.However, the audio quality really blows, really.... it really sucks. I thought I could deal with it, but it is just unacceptable. As such, I went to RadioShack and got a 2.1 speaker system and now it works great.The monitor's sleek black finish is appealing, stylish and will accent any room.In sum, this TV's picture quality makes all the difference despite the short comings of the audio capability. If you can get one of these for a good price and don't mind external speakers, then I would certainly recommend this TV."
3,"Yes, the audio really is that bad","I just set this TV up last night, and while the picture is great, the speakers are really horrible. If you see the TV at a good price, buy it, but be aware that you'll have to shell out extra for external speakers."
1,The speaker is unacceptable,"The picture quality is quite good, however, the speaker completely sucks. The 8bucks discount speakers I bought at fleemarket sound much better than this. As a TV this is unacceptable."
3,Channel up/down doesn't work,"The picture quality is fine and the audio quality isn't too bad either. However, the remote or receiver is poor. I have point the remote several times before it responds and the channel up/down doesn't work very well.I ended up buying a universal remote hoping this would help. All the functions work with the Westinghouse and Sony codes EXCEPT the channel up/down."
4,Good TV for the Price,"I purchased this TV during early 2007. So far it is working good. Speaker volume is poor, but for the size of TV it is OK. Since the DTV era begin, it needs converter box? But seems speaker volume slightly increased, due to converter box attached. Why they manufactured this TV analogue only?"
2,Bad Sound,"These reviews saved me a lot of trouble. My housemate bought this TV last week. She thought maybe the sound was so bad because the feed was coming from the cable instead of through the digital box, as my TV does. She had asked me to try connecting hers to the digital box to see if that would improve the sound. Instead I checked here first. Thanks!"
2,"Unacceptable audio, have to return it","I was so excited to get this television, I never splurge on myself. I hooked it up with no problem, and got a great picture. BUT...before reading the reviews I thought the speakers had to be defective, the audio is awful. I will be returning it today, the speakers sound like tin cans and I'll never get used to them. The television sits on a dresser in my bedrooom, so there's no room to hook up computer speakers."
2,Product was defective,"Tiger Direct was great, due to there quick shipping and excellent customer service; but the product was defective. LCD could only cycle through the monitor inputs and not the video or cable inputs. So basically instead of being a TV it was just an overpriced monitor. I sent it back to TigerDirect and they said they would give me a complete refund. Picture quality was good for the price and the size was great for my needs. I wish it actually worked as advertised. I will never order electronics online over $200 ever again. What a dissapointment especially having to wait two weeks to receive it overseas, finding out that its defective, and then wait another 2 - 4 weeks to get my refund. Also the couple of hours I spent troubleshooting thinking it was user error was a serious headache. I would definitely order from TigerDirect again since these things do happen. I dont know if I would buy a Westinghouse ever again. I hoped this helped someone."
3,Compliments Like Crazy,"I just got these shoes Steve Madden is one of my favorites..The shoes look even better in person however the little metal circle on the front kind of rubs on your foot making it a little annoying.. Other than that the shoes are great, very light weight"
3,Carolyn Shute wannabe,"Mildly entertaining, could be read in one sitting, not much emotional impact or character depth."
5,Excellent guide to the exact documents needed,This book is a lot like a recipe book: you determine the value of your assets and that will tell you exactly the documents you need to protect your estate. This is what makes this book stand out--you know exactly what you need and can save a lot of time and money by not having to pay a lawyer to determine this. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what they need before they start getting billed by the lawyers.
2,Lot's of fluff in this book,"This was the least helpful of the estate planning books I've recently read. It did have a lot of helpful information but the book is full of fluff, lot's of it. If you cut out the fluff there might be 50 pages worth of useful and helpful data. There are much better books on the topic of estate planning available. My opinion is that if you don't already have this book in your estate planning library, then you don't need it. Your money will be better spent elsewhere."
5,The nest movie I have ever seen,"A Good Baby is absolutly the best movie ever, it made you smile, it made you cry. It's the story of the amazing impact a small child can have on a person."
3,Small film with great preportions,"In A Good Baby we are taken to Western North Carolina, specifically Leighester, Asheville. This is the story about a baby that no one wanted that ended up changing the lives of every one who held it. Henery Thomas (All the Pretty Horses, ET) stars in this moving tale as the lonesome sole who finds and gets stuck with caring a baby. The mother of the baby a teen who messed up early is killed be her husband, David Strathairn (Simon Birch, The River Wild) who is consederable older than she was. Lena (the mother) her sister (played by Allison Glenn) is now looking for her and finds more than she bargens for. In the surcumstances of the acting I think they all portray mountain people failry well. I think first time star Allison Glenn gives a superb preformance along side Cara Seymour (You've Got Mail). Overall the film is very enjoyable and it tells a story that I think the directer felt needed to be told. A very enjoyable movie!"
1,i married a witch region 2,I cannot review this because I am unable to play this on my machine. I never heard of different regions and find it very deceiving that an american company sells an american film to an american customer and it is totally useless. It was a complete waste of money and I won't be ordering again.
5,come on DVD!!!,"This is one of my favorite b&w; films.Father and daughter witches torment a man's family through the ages until ""modern"" day. In the course of toying with our hero, the witch accidentally drinks the love potion she was trying to slip him. Now it's father vs daughter. Quaint special effects only add to the ""charm"" (no more pun-ishment, I promise.)"
3,I married a witch,"A great movie that I saw as a child.Time has not dimmed its appeal and I have been to Salem,Mass!"
1,Format not usable,Unable to view as video was in a European format that was not accessible for me and unfortunately this was not adequately communicated prior to purchase
1,PROPER details need to be provided,"I have an elderly friend who bought this dvd, and it is not stated outright (for seniors to understand) that this product is not playable in the united states. This needs to be clearable better than the frivolous 'regional zones' that are provided. Our seniors do not always see this, and accidentally buy somthing then after obtained, does not work in their USA dvds!!!"
3,Great South Asian poet. Iqbal's poetry translation,"Translation and spellings are at times not that great. But, the title can provide a semblence of the content of the original poetry."
3,Hard to follow,"This is a very good read, however it is very hard to follow. It does not offer a smooth flow to the reader. It is better to use it as a reference book, rather than a ""sit down with a good book"" book. The author is very knowledgeable in American history. I do recommend it in every Brother's library!"
4,Sims 2 Open for Business,If you are wanting to open & run your own business in Sims 2 than this is the Expansion pack for you. Alot of cool items in this one. Great Buy.
4,Another Great Addition To The Sims,"I can honestly say that I love this new expansion pack. It is so nice to be able to leave for work and actually see what your Sim is doing with their days. I have yet to experience any of the bugs that have been talked about here, but the one thing I found that I do not like is that, like in the other expansion packs, when you come back from downtown, it is the same time as when you left. So, if you go to your business at 9 a.m. and stay downtown working until 9 p.m., you are obviously exhausted, hungry, smelly......but when you get back home, it is still only 9 a.m. and your day is shot to hell. I have yet to have a family with this expansion pack, but I do not see how I will be to handle a business and a family with this game.With all that said, I definitely suggest buying this!"
3,Now I will spend even more time gaming ...,"This is one of the coolest addition to the SIMS series in my opinion. It really glues you to the game as you want to see how your business strategies work out.I would just recommend that the games are better tested. It does not annoy me too much, but when you get into it and then you run into a bug it tears you from the mood and the suspense of being inside the game."
3,Not the best,This is an okay expansion pack but it is not my favorate. It is cool but over all i don't really do much with it. I only got it for the stuff that comes with it not the fact that I can go to work with my sim
1,Not a good product!,"This game was really fun to play until I got a new computer. Now I feel like this is a waste of money because this game, along with all Sim2 games, does not work on Windows7 operating systems. EA games has a horrible website for trying to get help in getting the game to work right. EA games basically has no customer service so you are left on your own to try and figure out why this game won't work. What a waste and EA games is a hrrible company for not having good customer service."
3,"Good, Clean Fun","The Sims 2 OFB Expansion Pack is probably more for simmers who like a challenge and who have experience playing the Sims and the Sims 2 games. Open for Business can be extremely tricky and boring if you are one of the simmers who rely on cheats and boolprop tricks, or if you are new to the games. DO NOT use this game as a starter...anotherwards, don't just think you can try it for the first time without playing the Sims 2 first. If you happen to be experienced in the game, then it's a great challenge and can have great rewards if you are patient."
4,this is great if you wanna start a business in the game,"there is so much to do on this expansion. First you can buy a store and have your sim be the manager in charge. 2nd, this package comes with neato stuff that your sims will really enjoy. 3rd, dosn't even need being said."
2,Needed more!!!!,I have had a great time playing this game so far but it can be annoying. One thing I found that stunk was that when you use the boolprop cheat at a store and then choose one of your workers to raise his/her mood they well stop working for you. I hate leaveing at 9 in the morning for your store and then coming home at 6 and its 9 still at home. I hope the patch come soon cuz these bugs suck. I am very upset that there are not hardly any new items. For the price of the game we should have gotten alot more. It is also very hard to run a business. It is a ok game but needed more work done on it. It realy is not much it is not realy worth that much money. I know I may of not of bought it if I knew there was just this in new stuff. I would just wait for the next Sims game to come out or wait for the patch but if you like to do alot of work then in all means buy it. Good luck and have fun if you do buy it.
4,Good Game,I think the game is good but it is kinda hard. i am 12 so like ya. it is really hard own a bussiness and still keep all your hunger and healthy and all the stuff like that. also all your staff keeps quiting and so you can't really run a business. so i would buy the game but u have to be really good at it!
4,"Eh, Fun but Needs Work","I do like this game, for the most part. I love the new items, but I have found that the businesses that your Sims can buy and take care of are too much work and not very user friendly. I have always thought of the Sims as being as challenging as you would like, or as easy as you would like. I thought that getting my Sims rolling with their own businesses would be fun and exciting, but instead, I find it just more annoying and difficult than anything else. Although I have tried the whole ""personal business"" several times, I find that I use the items for the Sims and not for a business."
3,"Okay...., but kinda boring","I think it takes too much time to stand around in a store waiting for customers to buy, hiring employees, and building customer satisfaction. It gets pretty dull quick. I like the new floorings and decorating stuff, but it is seriously lacking in new objects. This was the last of the expansion packs I bought because I think I knew it would not be as fun as the others. One high note though is the ""shopping music"" that includes the songs you heard on the old Sims version. LOL. It was a nice trip down memory lane."
4,Best Addition Yet!,"I played The Sims 2 for quite awhile, and thought it was time to expand my gamming. So, by reading the reviews on Amazon, I was able to choose this game. I was very, very pleased with it.In this expansion pack, your sims can now open a buisness. They can choose to have a home buisness, or start a store off the lot (at a community lot). You have complete control, from hiring/firing other sims, to working them to the bone, to makeing them a hilarious uniform (my trademark uniform is a pink gorilla suit :-) ).I believe this is the best Expansion yet!"
4,Good expansion despite insane bugs,"First of all, this expansion pack is great, it adds a lot of nice features, the obdivious ones like starting businesses and all the robots. Though they are pretty easy to make piles of money with little effort anyone who plays the sims knows you can make it harder by doing things like trying to run the business with you as the only employee and such. But running a business in any sensiable way makes it just incredably easy to make piles of money. Despite that it's still pretty fun, since you can do all sorts of businesses.Also, there are a lot of bugs, they do get pretty annoying but sooner or later they will make a patch fixing all these bugs. If you can't deal with bugs just wait for the patch and everything will be fine."
3,Solid read,"Not up to the standard of the first two books of krispos, never the less a solid read to conclude the series"
2,A Fly in Himmelfarb's Eye,This book is an attempt by Ms. Himmelfarb to fit Mill into her vision of the 19th century. One only has to actually read On Liberty to realize that she hasn't suceeded. A more succinct (and less expensive) version of her thesis is her introduction to the Penguin edition of On Liberty. It is like having a creationist write an introduction to Darwin's Origin Of Species.
1,conservative ideology,"Himmelfarb is a conservative ideologue who is extremely unsympathetic to Mill's liberalism, which she seems to view as the root of all cultural evil in modern America. Her thesis that there are ""two Mills"" (one a classical liberal, the other -- inconsistent with the first -- a radical feminist/socialist controlled by his wife) has been thoroughly discredited in the academic literature. It is simply a product of Himmelfarb's own confusions. The book is so misleading as to be worthless."
2,Columbia Wimps Out,Too bad Republic didn't make this serial because over there they at least had Commando Cody and Captain Marvel up in the skies. Instead we get some fake animation everytime our boy in blue jumps. I'm sure that some think it's cute but I felt cheated. I give them 2 stars for trying though.
2,Review,"-Item arrived fast-Packaging intact-Item was as described-Would get a 5 star rating except the item had a very strong bug killing spray smell, such as roach spray for exp."
4,good family entertainment,"this is a great film to watch with the entire family. It has all of the elements that are successful to family films. The hero is a boy and his dog, plus it has the magical mystery of the supernatural and it leaves you with a good moral at the end. Morgan Brittany is different than I have ever seen her, without makeup and totally believeable as a mother. She has been very underated as an actress and this gives her another dimension. I highly recommend this to both children and adults."
4,Solid 4.,"I agree with ""a customer"" completely. It's a shame this isn't on DVD because too many people won't get the chance to see it. Like many fine family movies, this wasn't a commecial hit, so it's probably going to disappear. I hope there will be a movie channel at some point that looks for all these VHS gems and plays them for us. If you still have access to a VHS player, but this for a good family time. I watched it with my granddaughter. I think it's time to pull it out and watch it once more before my VCR breaks forever."
3,Good for what it is,"I've had this for close to a year now, and I barely use it. That being said, it is a good holster for what it is meant for - deep concealment. I use this when I don't want to be caught for sure, because it is VERY slim. You can move it around to different positions to suit specific needs, or just to decide what works best for you without buying six holsters. It is very quick to put on, but it lacks the security of my primary IWB holster.The main downside of it is that the leather is only on one side. I will not carry +1 in it because of this (no manual safety), but I've considered ""upgrading"" it myself. Also it shifts a lot depending on where you wear it."
3,way to small,"I purchased a small as I am a tiny person. But, this holster was so small it could have been for a child. It would not go around my waist and the gun could not fit into the holsters at all. I would call and get measurements first before ordering this product."
1,Arrived badly damaged - not retunable item,"Above I attached pictures of my toast that just arrived. At least four out of ten boxes came in badly crushed and one of those boxes was totally open.I wanted to return this item back as I paid for toast not crumbs, but groceries are not returnable. I am very disappointed in Amazon this time. They did not even bother to pack this item so it won't crush. I will not order groceries or any other non-returnable items with Amazon again."
3,pretty good,"This valance is ok. The colors are accurate, it has more of a shiny/silky look to it. Fits the window well."
2,Bills fan,"The picture showed a dark blue valence, but I received a light blue valance. Did not match. Please specify the correct colors please."
3,Good case but...,"The case is nice and give great protection to the camera. However, everytime when you need to take out the battery or the memory card, you have to remove the case completely including screwing the lock in the bottom of the camera. Otherwise, a good case."
2,A cover- not a case,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this case, despite quality construction, is awkward to squeeze my Canon 20D into and offers no real protection from the elements. If it were $10 I wouldn't complain, but I just bought the Tamrac 5684 Digital SLR camera case for $10 LESS and that action has a badillion pockets and seals my SLR away in a shock absorbent foam vault. I'm about to return the case/cover above right now."
4,Nice case!,"Well made Canon leather-like case with a convenient snape and velcro closure. Bottom piece screws into the tripod screw and can be left on for an extra measure of protection. Camera fits very well with a EF-S17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens or bigger. Edges are well stitched -- price seems reasonable given the quality of construction. Yes, made in China, but so are a lot of items. My only complaint is that I would have liked a case that would allow me to use the camera without having to take the camera all the way out of the case. I've heard that after market case makers make such an item."
3,Canon EH17L Semi Hard Case for the EOS 20D Digital SLR Camera,I find the case for the Canon EOS 20D SLR Digital camera is not frendly when attaching it to the camera and using it on the camera. You also have to remove the case bottom when removing the card from the camera.
2,Very average product for such a high-end product,"First of all, the allegedly New product arrived without any literature, warranty card, etc., and I haven't been able to obtain any either.Secondly, the combination of the Velcro and snap buttons don't work very well. The case gets in the way or falls off the camera.I am not very happy with the functionality of the product, given its price."
3,"Fun, but a flaw","My daughter LOVES to water plants with her daddy. The pail is the right size for her small 2 yr-old frame, but the lip is too small...she spills half the water out just when picking it up after it's been filled...it should extend further to prevent spillage. It seems quite durable, though."
3,Arrived bent and broken!,"This watering can arrived in the package bent, with a broken weld on the handle. As it was useless in that state, I had to return it. I know that insufficient packaging probably didn't help, the watering can was also of a much lower quality metal than I expected. It would have been perfect if made with a bit thicker grade metal! Disappointing."
1,It leaks.,Not for practical use. Maybe for a youngster using it outside to be like his or her mother or father but NOT for indoor use.
4,"Nice product, but two considerations before ordering it.","I am happy with the product and I am positive my son is going to like it. The item is easy to hold by small hands and light.However, there are two informations a buyer should know before ordering this product online:- You are told the product comes in assorted colors. However, you cannot make a choice of color when placing the order. I placed the order and the color of the watering can remained a mystery until I opened the box. The item I received is green and, luckily, I like it very much.- The manufacturer recommends the product for 24 months-old children and up. However, the sticker on the product reads ""Ages 5 & Up""."
2,Not great,"When I first saw this book I thought it was going to be great. I was quite disappointed! It is basically a long advertisement for the author's friend's yarns. The projects are lousy, the yarn choices are poor and do not show the stitches or the yarn to any advantage. There is a lot of silly talk about the author's and the yarn maker's ""visions"" for the project; flowery stuff that makes no sense. A total waste of time and money! I gave it two stars to be generous because I was able to glean two or three decent knitting tips, but I certainly do not recommend this book!"
5,Great book for the beginning lace knitter.,"I was delighted to find this great book on Lace knitting because I had been told it was out of print. It is lace knitting""out of the box"" and starts with a simple project and continues with increasingly more difficult projects, step by step. The directions are clear, concise, and complete with beautiful illustrations and the price was right. The book looks new in spite of being listed as used. Porters in Portland , Oregon got it to me in record time. They always do."
1,Mediocre at best,"The photography is exceedingly poor. The items were best displayed on the models, but the close-ups were poor. Dark colored, handpainted yarn was not the way to go to persuade anybody to try a particular pattern. Meg Swanson's Treasury of Lace Knitting will show you how photography for this sort of book SHOULD be done. Artsy meanderings about each project's ""inspiration"" in color and pattern selection didn't help. At least one pattern has an error in it. Really, these charts are not so complex that they couldn't be proofread."
2,"Old fashioned thriller offers a few chills, but falls short","The Owlsfane Horror is a ghost story breathing the last gasp of the sevenites. An engaged couple spends a terror filled week at the ski resort of Owlsfane, Vermont. Author ""Duffy Stein"" (a pseudonym for Mel Burger) keeps the pace slower than the gradual shifting of the earth's plates, allowing for lots of atmosphere and character development, but it drains the fear factor as characters begin behaving stupidly to simply inch the story forward one notch after another. And an Audrey Rose inspired town hall meeting sequence setting up the climax is simply jaw dropping in its sheer ludicrousness. At a bulky 474 pages, this novel needs a hefty 100 page trimming. Not a classic, and not exactly boring, it's just disappointing."
3,good idea but not very snug,"I was hoping the skin would fit like a wet-suit. However, it is looser than I'd hoped for. I keep it on my camera, anyway. Mine came with a plastic coating to protect the 3"" LCD screen. That's a good idea. I suggest buying it anyway because it will definitely keep my camera from getting scratched-up -- almost like a book cover."

4,Wow; what a change!!,Very well built & executed power supply. But the output board had 8 JRC op-amps. This would put a hold on everything behind it Like the Reialta engine and great power supply. So in went 8- AD 8620B amps And Now I can hear WAYYYYY deeper into the music. Movies have lots more impact too. Robo-FET
1,disapointed fan,"I'am the bigest britney fan, I bought the video, in high hopes of seeing some new stuff an learning more about her, It was just people talkin about her an I can't get payed enough to sit through it again, If your thinking about buying this don't, wait till the offical britney video comes out, It's just waste of money. If you buy it anyways, just remember I warned you."
1,nonofficial videos suck!!!!,Whats up with non official videos? They suck!!! Who wants to listen to someguy talk and show the same pictures over and over again?
2,Nice to see all the family and freinds but it was boring.,There was hardly any footage of britney on this tape. It looked like it was put together in one hour. I really like Britney but this is not a very good representation of her and her skills.
1,She's a great artist but this video does nothing for her,"I think Britney is a great singer and dancer but I was not too impressed with this video. I was expecting to see more of Britney and not just her life. I was nice to see the ""never before seen pics"" but i would have rather seen her talking to the camera about her life than people from her home town telling about how they grew up with her and knew her."
2,I did NOT enjoy it,"I am a BIG Britney fan, so I bought the video, and it sucked! The only good thing was some pictures never seen before, but that's it, and it gets pretty boring."
2,Yawn... ZZZZZzzzzzz,This vid was super-boring! They had stupid little interviews with people who knew her when she was little. Basically saying a lot of the same repetitive stuff: she was so outgoing and friendly! Don't waste your money on this- all of this stuff I already knew.
4,Great Video,"This is a great video. If you are a Britney fan it's a must have!! It includes Britney, her friends, and her mom talking in it!! It tells about her ""mousekteer"" days and her childhood. It also has some of the cutest baby pic's of her!! The only bad think is that it has no music in it, it's just an interview video."
2,"I love Britney, but this video was kind of dull.","Britney is my favorite performer on Earth, but I think this video was kind of dull. It showed more of her hometown people than it did her. She didn't seem to be the featured person, her hometown was."
1,Very disappionted!!!,"I am such a Britney fan and this video is unauthorized so it totally sucks!!! I give it a ""1"" because I can't give anything of Brit's any lower plus I couldn't go lower. People don't waste your money! The profits don't even go to Britney! Just wait til an AUTHORIZED and OFFICIAL video of her's comes out with a bunch of better stuff on it. This video is like a boring biography! Britney you rule but this video didn't do anything for me! Love you Brit"
1,the worst 50 muintes ever!,OK don't watse your time buying the video. It looks awesome but you need to buy time out with britney spears if you want alot of britney and an awesome video.The ONLY piece of britney you get is a clip of her singing @ a mall! DO you want just that and some of her friends talking about her life this is for you but if you want alot of britney check out time out with britney spears.
5,i think the britney spears video was the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the britney spears video was better than any music video i have ever seen! she has a great voice! she kept a good beat to the song with her dancing! her dancing i think probably was the best part of the video! you guys out there make sure to watch it! it is the best!!!!!!!!!!
3,I'ts britneys life but i'm kinda mad,I'm in love with brit but this video just didn't do her justice i can't wait to get the official one cause then i can drool intensely Love ya lots brit
2,WAIT FOR THE OFFICIAL ONE!,"My good Lord, from the look sof it, the video sounds pretty bad. I am not usually a person that make my decisions from what others say, but this is way too convinable. Besides, I wouldn't expedct this one to be good since it's her first video. WAIT FOR THE OFFICIAL VIDEO AND I AM SURE IT WILL BE ALOT BETTER. (It will come out early-fall)"
1,I thought it sucked i hate britney she is so ugly!!!!!,"Britney why are you so ugly were did you get your looks from!!! get a face job!!!Nice fake bobbies,get a life cilecone loser"
3,I Watched This Video Once...,"And haven't since! This unofficial vid is totally stupid because you don't ever get real interview footage with Britney and you only see her a few times at a mall preformance, but you never hear her sing! And its hard to see her because the sponser of the show shes at has their name on a banner which has to be blocked out the whole video!Its not very good because all you see are interviews with people who barely knew Britney! THe closest you get is Britneys relatives! IF you are a fan this video isn't all that great unless you are interested in Britneys past a lot! I gave it 3 stars because It was cool at first but really I wouldn't reccommend it!"
1,A Complete Waste of Time and Money,"Don't be fooled. For those who admire Britney for her music, there is none here. And for those whose primary concern is her looks, there is next to no footage of her above the age of 11. The makers of this video seem to have been only interested in getting something--anything--they could put Britney's name on. So we get interviews with people who knew her growning up. Take a look at the picture on the cover. That's the closest this comes to any representation on Britney and it's the best you'll see on this DVD, by far. So just photocopy the cover if you must."
1,~*~STUNK~*,"~*~Okay I worked hard outside mowing the lawn just to get enough money to buy this stupid video:( When i baught it I thaught it was gonna be her talking and singing and answering some of the questions that evryone wants to know. Instead of doing that all the people in her small town talked about how they used to have doll parties, and how she threw her retainer in her teacher's hand! It basically didn't say anyhting about her now~a~days it only talked about her when she was younger. I know that i wanted to know what shes doing next and if she has a new album comming out, instead i sat there and listen to her old hair dresser say ""oh i used to cut her hair!"" So i do not reccamnd anyone to buy this it is a waist of $$$$MONEY$$$$$$$$$$$$."
1,"DO not waste your money on the DVD, if any buy the VHS","Don't waste your money on the DVD. Heck, even the VHS unless you really want to see this. There is no Britney, just little parts they show her on a stage but it is faded and no sound. The whole video is the video people interviewing people from Britney's home town Kentwood, LA. Very boring! Although it is nice to hear what they have to say, but its not worth it - especially since Britney is not in it."
2,Malli's final decision not worth all that navel gazing,"The film is sure darn nice to look at but it couldn't prevent all the introspection from grating on me after awhile. The film also lacks any hint of subtlety as the plot steamrolls through one complication after another, all designed to give Malli even more to mull over. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. Maybe the film would resonate with me more if I had a brother who had been the victim of a political assasination. But I don't. Or maybe if I could imagine just one benefit of martyrdom. But I can't. About the only thing I did notice, and this was very early on, was that the payoff for all this agonizing introspection will clearly come at the end of the film when we witness Malli's final decision. Although I genuinely wanted to know Malli's ultimate choice, I felt I was forced to wait too long and sit through too much melodrama for it."
5,Great Movie,"I loved the movie The Terrorist. It is a non-Bollywood Indian film that doesnt altogether escape the somewhat cheesy nature of some of these movies, but it remains extremely emotional and dark throughout. The main character struggles between her duty to her ""country"", the rebels she fights with, and sacrificing her life to take the lives of others (namely the leader of the Government, this sort of assassination has really taken place in India in the fairly recent past). She seems to really begin to understand the beautiful, fragile nature of life when she meets a little boy who is to be her guide. The movie is not too violent and I would recommend it to a mature PG-13 audience."
5,DESTROY OR CREATE=TO BE OR NOT TO BE,"The major attraction of this film for THE MAN WITH THE KINOAPPARAT is the sound design. Any serious sound guys out there, you need to read this book as a text book.The person who picked this particular film up for distribution in the US is an amazingly familiar name to those serious film these people; John Malkovich!Well, I did not expect you to know this but it is the truth! At the initial screening at NUART theatre, the tie and suit guys fled so fast that one could easily gage the ultimate uniqueness of the film just by looking at the speed of these guys!It is a fascinating journey into the shady area where ethics and higher ideals clash/where animal nature and intellect clash, depends on the way you would like to phrase it!Filmmaking, artistry and authenticity at its best! I watched it breathless knowing that it would not get a national theatrical release. It was that good. Don't hesitate, go for it."
3,"Disappointing for fans of ""The Uninvited.""","With a similarly spooky theme, and nice, fluid writing style, this promised to be a great read since Macardle's ghost story ""the Uninvited"" is a particular favorite of mine.Unfortunately, this novel is a real let down. The story concerns a woman who seems to have the gift of pre-cognition, but sees things that aren't always pleasant. This lead character acts so preposterously that I lost all patience with her and Macardle. It's okay if you don't use her previous book as a standard."
4,Book,I gave this as a gift to my finace. He was on a boat kick and really enjoyed it. Perfect for anyone who likes history and all thing nautical.
1,Eh...,"It's boring and preachy. There is one great action scene, but the (very) few others are so poorly cut it is difficult to tell what is even going on. There are some little treats for people who appreciate Japanese animation, but even then it is hard to tell if they meant homage or just cliche."
1,"Bloated, convoluted, and ultimately, boring","Wow, I have no idea what movie the 5-star reviewer saw but it wasn't Casshern. Absolutely nothing in this movie ""makes Neo's battle against the multitude of Agent Smith's from the Matrix Reloaded look like a Sunday school bible meeting."" And there is no way any scene qualifies as the ""better superhero-style battle ever put on film.""This movie was bloated, convoluted, and ultimately, boring. The character development was pretty weak to start with but becomes even more so when one of the characters you start out empathizing for goes inexplicably bad."
1,Seriously...the trailer was better than the film.,"Ok. There are a few things I learned from buying and watching this movie. One, don't ever buy a movie simply based on the trailer. Two, Japanese people are apparently bad at acting, writing, and computer graphics. Three, this movie is at the very bottom of the list and I'm trying really hard to find a reason why it's not worst than Van Helsing or Cat Woman(Making it the all-time worst movie ever made)."
3,Amazing visuals but little else,"Unfortunately, Casshern is the type of movie that's big on glitz and little on anything else. The graphics were fantastic, rivaling Lucas's Star Wars, Episodes 1-3 in imagination (if not integration). It had the look and feel of an epic sci-fi! Unfortunately it falls flat. The bad guys are cliche, anime style fashion victims, complete with overdramatic laughter and loud, obnoxious delivery. The fighting choreography is basically non-existent, choosing to sacrifice exchange for speed. I was often left wondering why someone flew across the room; were they even hit?!? Best of all, it's all held together with paper-thin character and plot development. I watched 4/5ths of the film, but couldn't justify spending any more time.Despite what I've said, I gave this movie three stars. It was an above average venture, with interesting ideas, and wonderful graphics. But it isn't a keeper, save for the sci-fi completist."
1,SIGH,I watched (Casshan:Robot Hunter) as a little kid when it came on the scifi channel and it was an awesome anime but this live action movie named Casshern just stinks because it's nothing like the anime.There is very little action and the story is a mess...
2,meh,"I purchased this version hoping to see some of the special features with English subs. I have not yet watched the dvd, but I was pretty unhappy when I found that the movie was just 117 minutes long, when the original was 141 minutes long. I don't see how they can take a pretty much perfect movie and mutilate it like that. Don't waste your money on this, find the original version and just live without the special features."
2,Incorrect Run Time?,"This is not a review of the film, because for that I would give it 4 stars. I'm talking about the 80 minute American run-time, and I don't think that Amazon has it listed incorrectly either. It is similar to the case of Jet Li's Fearless, the American directors cut was a half hour shorter than the Chinese original directors cut. Do what I did and by the original Japenese version. You'll get the full run-time, and two extra discs of special feature. Damn you America for butchering foreign cinema."
2,There are so much better Japanese movies...,"Like so many films today, this is one whose premise is much better than the actual film. The trailer shows you all you really need to see. Yes, it is impressive to see a bunch of random body parts suddenly coming together to form Frankenstein-like (although seamlessly put together) mutants and it is nice seeing the title character kick the crap out of a bunch of robots but the painfully slow pace of meaningless plot between these great scenes are punishing. It could do with a round of editing, reducing the length of each scene which might turn it into something worth sitting through. As for the mix of animation and live-action, it just doesn't work. It looks like when Mary Poppins and all jumped into the sea and danced with the animated fish. Save for the mutants, the acting isn't as bad as most current Japanese SF flicks but that is a mixed blessing."
5,Awesome Asian Film,One of the best Asian films I have seen. This is a high octane action film. Special effects are unbelievable. The running time is incorrect at 80 mins. The movie is approx 2 hours and 15 minutes long. This is one movie you can't pass up on.
4,Very Cool,"I dig this movie. It's hard to follow and seems a little shallow in plot, but the style is awesome, and the soundtrack is a hit. If you like fast paced action movies that you could think about, but don't have to to enjoy this is for you."
1,"loved the 1973 &1994 cartoons, hated this","I watched with the Japanese audio and subtitles. This movie started out well enough, but quickly stopped being entertaining. A friend who was not familiar with the source material watched it with me and really couldn't follow what was going on. I don't think the film was well written, it's very convoluted. Also, something about the CG and colors used in the movie made my eyes hurt a little. Overall, a huge disappointment.Most of the acting was good, the music was about a 50/50 split for me. The robot designs were also pretty neat, many of them followed the originals pretty closely. I wish they had been featured more prominently.Minor SPOILER ALERT!The BK androids are zombies in this movie. Yeah. But they do command robot armies, so that's... almost OK? Add in a mechanical stone lighting bolt that never gets explained and other subplots completely unrelated to the 1973 original and you've got a disaster."
2,Just missed,"Waited a long time to see this movie and I fell asleep. It's not that bad, just started to go all over the place."
4,"fun movie, bad soundtrack","Get Amon Tobin's 'Chaos theory.' Put the subtitles on, start the movie. push play on the stereo when the studio logo comes on the screen. It makes the movie way better. Of course, the movie is longer than the album, so passed that, I don't know what to tell you. I frankly didn't enjoy the movie with it's soundtrack. It sounded canned and stock. The movie is eye candy, brain dope, over-the-top action, but the sound track is kinda crappy. Check out the art direction."
5,Great Price and a great deal,"good shipping deal, and a directors cut of an uncommon foriegn film, all for a reasonably cheap price."
2,Boring,"I had high hopes for this movie. I thought that if i was patient while watching it, that the action would get better. Well sorta. When the main character gets his powers the fight scenes lasted only a few short, bad edited minutes. It has so much potential because it is has nice visuals and plot build up. But it never pans out. Rent don't buy. You'll be pissed if u do buy."
1,Sorry,"Bad inconsistant ill concieved messy story line. Cheesie cartoon effects. Cornball acting. Forced darked brooding feel. I don't know if having watched the original cartoon would of helped, or produced contempt of a remake. I usually have a taste for chessie scifi, this one sort of falls flat on its face. One reviewer mentioned this movie a prime canidate for MST3K, wholefully agree. I did notice alot of lot of reviewers went nuts over this movie; glad someone enjoyed it."
3,Casshern - Director's Cut,Amazon is incorrect in the listing of the runtime - this is the 125 minute version (117 minute in the UK). This has not been edited by the studio (like Zu Warriors/Legend of Zu etc). This is the official Director's Cut of the movie (if you look closely at the box art you will see the banner at the top also informs you of this)- it just so happens that the Director's Cut is a lot shorter than the released theatrical version - a Director's Cut does not mean a longer cut! I like the unedited version although it does have a tendancy to ramble a bit...so I would be interested in seeing this version.
4,Right to Life,"Casshern visual are stunning. This is not a fight movie but right verses wrong who has the right to exist. Because of man and war machinary and pollutants the human race is on the verge of extinction, until a geneticist's discovery of ""Neo-Cell"" which can rejuvenate the human body. Sad to say with any great discovery there is always a bad guy or corporation that wants to controll and own it for themseleves. But we have a hero that discovers the lies and others self motivations and a race of people that are the solution that can help humanity.I enjoyed it and felt it was a good buy."
1,"if you throw enough mud against a wall something sticks, but what?","This movie borrows so many styles of so many famous directors, I completely lost track. The only thing thatheld my attention was that I never had a clue which part of the kitchen sink I was going to get next. As a wholeit is interesting, but even the great CG effects sometimes left me asking why? Sometimes they're thrown inwith no connection to the ""story"" and I think I am being generous saying that. There isn't a plot that makessense let alone one you might remember 24 hours later. The only reason I don't feel ripped off is that I gotthe dvd cheap! Okay movie to watch if you're on LSD maybe. If you watch movies or anime sober, pass thisone up."
2,$3.99?,"I watched this movie to the end because I was bored and because I paid for it, but $3.99 is way too much for watching this movie.$0.50 would be okay only if you are really bored.You can assume I didn't like it and don't recommend it."
4,A China Painting,"The willow pattern china commonly know as BLUE WILLOW takes form in this excellent romance by Deborah Smith. I came to the book as a long time collector and dealer in willow pattern ware and not only is the story fascinating, but Ms. Smith's knowledge of ceramics is broad, which give an added dimension to the story.All bittersweet romances live long in your memory.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,I AM A DEBORAH SMITH FAN,But this book seemed long. The characters didn't totally engage me - I didn't really care about how they would resolve the conflicts. My favorite characters were minor ones - the aunts. I could hardly wait to see what they were up to. I was stuck in bed after a surgery and so very disppointed that I was waiting for the book to end.
4,Read this years ago - just re-read it on my Kindle,Deborah Smith has written several good books...this was one of my favorites. I downloaded it to my Kindle and enjoyed Blue Willow for a second time. I vaguely remembered the story and found it was written so well that I was happy to re-read it. The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because there were so many typos in the Kindle version. Sometimes the main character Artemas' name was grossly mispelled. I would love to see new fiction from this author.
4,Really good read.,Good story line. Easy to relate to the characters. Only problem was that Ms. Smith probably could have come up with the same ending in a few less pages.
4,Blue Willow,"Plots that twist and turn love,hate,anger and at last peace. Keeps you waiting to see what happens next. Secrets that finally come to light. Held my interest at times brutal but it is about life. 4 out of 5 stars"
4,Same style as 'Silk and Stone',"This was a good story, but like 'Silk and Stone' is a slow starter. The action starts quickly, but connecting events and characters is a little tedious in the beginning. If you are patient, it's a good read, and I recommned it."
3,Blue Willow,"I enjoyed the story line. It reminded me of something I had read before, but all in all it was OK, fast easy read."
3,"Deborah Smith is a master, but this is not her best","I've recently become a Deborah Smith fan, and this is the third of her books that I've read. While the premise of the book is quite good and quite different, the actions of the characters at various times are not believable. Mix that with a few violent sex scenes (she hits him, he pulls her hair and forcibly confines her, she submits, they have mind-blowing sex) and the whole book comes off fairly trashy - rather like a Harlequin Romance rather than the higher quality product that she usually writes. The ending is good though, and quite a surprise. For the greater portion of the book, however, it was not a page-turner."
3,GOOD READ.,"I enjoyed this book, but there were parts that were trite and certainly childish fantasies indulged of the handsome prince and the poor maiden hooking up. Oh well, it was good nonetheless and I still stayed up late reading it to find out what would happen with Lily and Artemus."
2,Did Not Like The Hero,I bought this book after seeing it highly recommended on the Amazon discussion forum. I cannot imagine why everyone liked it. The hero puts both his job and his family ahead of the heroine. I do not call that love. He is extremely selfish. I have read many Deborah Smith novels and liked this one the least.
5,Cool Spidey,"This figure is tons of fun for kids (and big ones, too!) of all ages. The figure has magnets on both hands and both feet. The coloring of the figure is better as opposed to the first movie's figure which was a duller red. This one is a more vibrant red. The articulation has diminished a bit but that is probably for more stability since we have magnets now. I gave durability 4 stars because as with any plastic action figure it can be broken. The flagpole it comes with is enjoyable for kids because the figure will spiral down down and it is a pretty long ride once you connect the three pieces that make up the flagpole. But for displaying purposes it is not cool because the figure will not be sustained mid-pole like one would imagine. It just spirals down once you let go. But toys are for kids right? ;O)All in all it is a very cool figure, though. Especially the brighter coloring."
1,A collection filler,"I love The Crystal Method; however, this single offered nothing special to make it worth the purchase. If you like this song, then buy the albumCommunity Service"
2,Uh... huh?,Weird story. It didn't seem to flow well. Maybe there was too much symbolism. And what the heck did the title have to do with anything?Go ahead and read if it is free but I wouldn't spend money on it.
3,meh,"The author has a mostly good writing style. Parts are messy, like dialog and flashbacks. Sadly, the story itself wasn't very good. Everyone else seemed to like it, but I feel like I wasted time reading it."
4,Mystical Realism,"""The Frog, The Wizard and The Shrew"" is my favorite of all Myers' stories thus far. The characters are vivid, enjoyable - sometimes even haunting. I got so wrapped up in the story that I was sorry to see it end. Hopefully Ms. Myers will bring this group of characters back together again for another mysterious quest in the near future."
2,"Okay, there's better out there","I love these type of movies and have many of them them. This one was just okay, theres much better out there"
3,Funnier than Leonard Maltin's review...,"This movie is a lot of fun, despite what Leonard Maltin says in his review. Tony Curtis hams it up to the max as a n'er-do-well male gold digger. One of the best scenes revolves around Tony and Ms. Gabor, where she loses her voice before they marry, but boy when it comes back, very funny! Take a chance on this one, and see why movies like Tomcats and Saving Silverman should have gone direct to video."
1,Wrong Item sent Twice,"There seems to be something wrong with the coding of this item in their system, because they've sent me the wrong item twice - the same wrong item each time. Instead of the Jacobite Rebellions 1689-1745, they've sent the British Army at War 1914-1918."
4,Useful tool for Audiology and well equipped for digital consumption,"Used for a course in basic audiology. Useful tool, especially considering how well OCR is for this particular text. A+"
4,I like this clock a lot!,"This was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall. I was very familiar with this clock since I had the original one for almost 3 years. I like the look of this clock and I like the choices you have for different displays. Overall this is a sweet clock. I did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and ""program"" this clock it won't do what you want it to do, not sure if it how the owners manual is written, or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features!"
2,Poor receiver in this clock,"I own 4 La Crosse Radio Controlled clocks (2xWS-8007, 1xWS-8157, 1xWT-2171 and 1 La Crosse WT-981L Radio Controlled watch. This model, WS-8007, has the poorest receiver of all of these La Crosse clocks. The watch and the other two clocks pick up the 60kHz signal from anywhere in the house, but this model HAS to be near a window. Could be poor electronics or poor tuning of the internal antenna.I also own an Atomix 005821A and it works everywhere except my office at work, which works about 25% of the time.I do not recommend this particular model."
1,Would not reset for Daylight Saving Time (DST),"A major concept of an ""atomic"" clock to me meant I would not have to reset it for DST. Other clocks in my home took care of it. I waited two weeks, and this clock did not. I can't trust if for the true time, so I am sorry I purchased it."
4,Complete recording of incomplete performance.,"Further to the first review, I would concur that the performance is 'beautiful', Corelli being in superb form. The principal recording is in fact complete : it was the performance that was incomplete. Perhaps the U. S. release had different notes, but the E. U. release informs us in the notes that at the point at which the music ends, a rainstorm had broken out that made continuation of the (outdoor) performance impossible ; one can hear the ensuing fuss on the recording!"
2,Truth in publishing and selling,"Book ,"" Chinese Jews of Kaifeng"". was advertised as used book ""signed"" by author , ExcellentCond."" It was actually a new ""POD"" ( print on demand)It should have been advertised as such , since there are people who buy books for collections and reference and historic value . I hope this does not mean I haveto by-pass Amazon and head back to the bookstores ( new & used)"
4,She was a up and coming female rapper,B Angie B should have continued her career as a rap artist because they are few and limited when it comes to females. Her rap style is unique and all i have to say there will never be another like her. And if you don't own this albumn you need to get it because it is hot!!!!!
3,Nice book,"This book is pretty to look at, but it is very wordy and I just don't love it like I thought I would."
3,Paranormal Entity,"Just a rip-off of the movie, Paranormal Activity. The movie has all the same stuff - stuff happening while they sleep, a scared girl who is also cursed,ect. The movie is whatever and good only if you get it for a low price or watch it on CHILLER."
4,A direct Paranormal Activity rip-off...but pretty damn good!,"Ok...this isn't high budget, and probably on a slimmer budget than even Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch. But there are a couple scenes in this that were really scary. I love Paranormal Activity...which this is a total copy of...but this movie actually made me jump, which ""Activity"" didn't.The acting is thinner than its budget, but who cares? This is a fun movie with some truly creepy moments. I won't spoil anything here, but lets just say the footprints were eerie.I'm a big fan of high-budget, CGI horror and sci-fi movies. I crave bang for my buck. But if you like the first-person films like Cloverfield, Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity...and aren't expecting Oscar award winning performances...you will most likely enjoy this flick!"
1,"looked promising, but ended up fast forwarding the entire movie","by the commercials they had for it on tv, i was like ""SWEET!!!"" looked better than 'paranormal activity', so i gave this movie a shot. i ended up fast forwarding through the entire film because it was so boring and lacked substance. you knew the plot already because it had already been done before. 'paranormal entity' didn't provide anything more than 'paranormal activity' did. the plot was worse, there were less graphics, and the movie just plain sucked. i want the last hour of my life back!!!"
1,Waste of money!!,This movie is ridiculous. It was cheap and completely fake!!! It was boring and a complete waste of time.
1,Lame..,"I didnt like it, I thought it was dumb. Pisses me off that they try to pass it off as something that ""really"" happened, then follow through with real bad acting and unrealistic scenerios. Parts that are suppose to be scary with the girl screaming I actually found kinda funny, especially the end. lol.. ""AHHHHHH..Greughg!"" So yea, I liked Paranormal activity better, I thought that was scary, but this..lol. Um..No."
2,"HO-HUM, ANOTHER HORNY GHOST STORY","Ghost tries to rape young woman - how sickening and unoriginal.Samantha usually sleeps in some type of p.j. but the night the ghost is going to attack her, she's in her Victoria Secret undies? Give me a break. And listening to Tom's winded breathing all through this movie was annoying. In one scene, she's screaming topless in a bathtub - while wearing jeans? THEN, we finally see the real subject of the movie.........HER BOOBS! Actually, the movie was MERCILESSLY boring until the end so, I gave it two stars for the end."
3,Not as bad you may think,"Despite what some of the other reveiwers on here may have thought, and its clear rip on the new horror classic (Paranormal Activity). I didnt think it was that bad. In fact a few years from now it couldve been one of those B-Movie sequels. Paranormal Activity 7, or something like that. Overall, if you were into the original you'd probably enjoy this. The only really big flaw, and probably the reason why so many people complain. Is the horrible ending. It shouldve have been about 15 mins longer. They shouldve shown what happened to the doctor, and how the sister ended up on the floor in the room. As for rip offs. Anytime there is something new in the world of movies & music, its copied. Especially when its made for cheap, and grosses tons of cash like PA."
2,Paranormal detail,"Paranormal Entity is the latest addition to the independent low budget horror movie rip offs. After witnessing a special DVD showing of this spectacularly terrifying film, I can say without a doubt, that I will be sleeping tonight.It might be a Paranormal Activity rip off but this movie was no better. I was waiting, and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and then the movie ended. I don't know what movie these other people were watching who wrote great reviews but it wasn't the Paranormal Entity I saw. Paranormal Entity was shot like a video camera documentary and perhaps this is why the horror was muffled.To be fair, its horrible, and it isn't scary either."
4,B-Movie lover's delight,"This is an ultra low-budget version of Paranormal Activity...if there could be such a thing (PA cost $15k to make). The premise is very familiar: obsessed filmmaker follows his mother and sister around with camera equipment as he attempts to record the existence of an evil, dangerous force which happens to be plaguing their lives. The entity is particularly fond of the filmmaker's sister, who is often the victim of the attacks.This is a fun, low-budget film in the vein of (say)Night of the Demonswhere the acting is pitiful and the story is full holes...but entertaining nonetheless. I don't think the film is worth the $20 pricetag currently attached to it, but for a lower price one could do a lot worse than spending an evening with the lights turned low and this film in the spinner."
4,Great except for one thing,"THese are great, the only problem I have is that the material the ""thong"" part between your toes is made of rubs them raw if I wear them for too long."
3,ok for flip flops,"Got these for my husband. They seem ok, and now I notice Amazon has a better discount on them. I got them for 29 which was a bit much, but 19 is ok. They are a bit long at the toe (space left between the edge of the slippers and hubby's toes) and are mostly made of canvas. Just a little leather on the straps. Nice looking. As the last reviewer said, order a size bigger than your usual if you're using American sizes. (or maybe a half size)"
4,Add to your reference library.,"Corporate Storytelling should be added to the reference library of anyone starting out in the corporate communications arena. This book is a useful tool for the novice as well as those experienced in corporate communications. Clear, concise steps to follow make this a must have!!"
4,"Finally, a perfect corporate communications book","As a corporate writer, I found Lecia's book incredibly helpful. Even with a decade of experience, I picked up some wonderful insights, excellent tips, and useful hints and ideas. This book is a ""must have"" for anyone who wants to break into the world of corporate writing. And for those already there - buy this and use it every day. You'll be glad you did."
1,Not what I wanted!,Thought this was going to be knitting and crochet projects and turned out to be mostly sewing. I don't sew so I gave this book to someone that does.
3,They're coming to take me away...,"This was the third and final album of Buck Owens' late '80s/early '90s ""comeback"". It was also his last studio album ever. It is easily the weakest of the three comeback albums, with no charting singles at all. That's not to say it's a bad album, because it's not. Overall, it's a pretty decent album, with some good songs, but not as good as the songs Buck usually recorded. I think the fact that this album has been out for over 20 years, and I'm just now writing the first review of it, shows how little interest people have in it."
4,great product BG e2,"this is a great product, just another one by canon. it mounts perfectly to the 20d and has great features. the only reason i gave it 4 stars not 5, is its a little heavy. other than that its a nice addition to the 20d. i would recomend it to anyone."
4,Quality Accessory for Your 20D,This battery grip will enable you to double your battery capacity along with having the buttons to help you to take images in portrait. I find that I have my battery grip attached all the time and I find it invaluable. Be aware though that the grip with two batteries added does add considerably to the weight of the camera. The grip attaches to the camera very securely though you have to make sure that it is tightened every now and then. I don't regret making this purchase because it has added to my camera in many ways.
4,2nd Unit Works Perfectly,"My first unit was a higher serial number unit (108XXX) and did have a power indication problem after loading recharged batteries. The replacement unit, a slightly lower serial number, works perfectly. Fit on both units was nice and tight with no gaps."
4,Just what the 20D needs for big lenses,"Although people had problems with the first generation of this grip, I've been completely satisfied with mine. Recently, I've been shooting with a 300 2.8L, and it would be much more difficult without the extra length the grip ads to the body. Similarly, the second set of buttons for vertical shooting makes a big difference, too. (One note: when shooting vertical, it is hard to actuate the thumb wheel and impossible to use the joy stick--which I do frequently to change focus points--without moving my right hand.) By holding two batteries, the grip also keeps me from worrying about running out of juice during high volume shooting sessions.The grip still has a little flex in it, but I've never had any of the power problems that I've read about here and elsewhere."
5,truly worth it,I was cautious when i first considered to buying this product but after receiving it i love it. the grip fits perfectly i don't know what other people are talking about when they say it's loose or doesn' fit right mine is perfect. it's a must have for any one who uses long lenses or loves to shoot portraits. the only down side to this accessory is the added weight it gives the camera but i think its worth it.
5,Flexibility,"I am absolutely pleased with this product.One of the most impressive things about this product is the flexibility it provides.I just recently had to cover an event at May Walters Elementary school featuring 5 senators, Dr Crew, and both mayoral candidates for Hialeah.Half way through shoot i ran out of battery power, my fault.I asked for 6 double a batteries loaded up my magazine and continued shooting. That kind of flexibility is priceless. The other flexible option this product posesses is the additional shooting button located at the bottom right of the battery grip allowing you to shoot vertically using this hot button.This prevents you from having to twist your wrist and forearm to take a vertical shot, for sports this is critical as seconds count when an athlete is in motion. I you are a photographer amateur or professional buy this product it is worth every penny."
5,Makes camera easier to use.,"Everything as advertised, easier to handle and you don't have to worry about batteries running out."
5,Great battery pack. Highly recommended.,"I've been using this battery grip for a couple months now, and I can't say enough good things about it. I really like the option to use AA batteries or the dual rechargable batteries. It's perfect for use when travelling, in case you don't have ready access to a charger. It adds a little extra weight to the camera, so you may not want to use it for everyday use, but it works exellent as well as adding a professional look to the camera."
1,Truly disappointing accessory,"This has to be one of the worst EOS accessories Canon has ever put out; hopefully they will revise its design soon. The grip does not rest flush with the bottom of the EOS 20D regardless of how much you torque the nut. The small amount of play is annoying, but there is a much more serious problem in the form of intermittent power interruptions. A medium-heavy lens (e.g. 70-200mm 2.8) and a flash cause enough flex in the BG-E2 when you hold the camera by the grip that the electrical pins on the grip lose conact with the terminals in the 20D body. Quite unacceptable for anyone who needs a reliable camera for active work. There are work arounds in the form of shimming the grip, but Canon should have done a better job, especially considering how wonderful a camera the 20D is."
1,"Never get a BGE2 battery grip Canon said ""We fix it"" its a lie","Until now I was a proud owner of a Canon EOS 20D, well not any more!! Canon support is the worst support I've ever known. I bought this GIRP all brand new and it never worked. I talked to Canon support and they said: ""send us the grip""; now they are trying to charge me $60!!! for fixing their mistakes!!!Never get a BGE2 battery grip.One Star is to much for this item, Amazon should implement negative stars, I would give it -5 stars"
2,Worked well until it fell apart...literally.,"I purchased this grip used (probably where I went wrong in the 1st place). It has been working fine until tonight while I was shooting a sweet 16. I had my 5D MKii, connected to a 70-200 ISii & 580 EX flash, hanging upside down from my Spider Holster: [...]The BG 2E actually BROKE while I was standing still with camera hanging in proper position. Four screws and the tightening wheel actually fell out. Luckily it didn't separate completely, and my D5 didn't fall to the floor. Debating whether I should purchase a new one vs carrying the extra batteries on my person."
3,Sporadically Brilliant but Bland by T Bone Standards,"Sometimes T Bone is too smart for his own good; other times he tries to make a straight rock album and you get the sense he's just slumming. ""The Talking Animals"" doesn't quite gel, even though ""The Killer Moon,"" co-written by his (then) six-year-old daughter, ranks up there as a Burnett classic. (It's also an amazing video.) ""The Strange Case of Frank Cash..."" is a wonderful story but works only for the first few listens. The rest is, it pains me to write, sort of generic. You know there's a genius behind it all but it sounds like he's trying to make a pop album. Though I heartily recommend all his other efforts, this one is just for the die-hards."
4,Burnett is a musical genius (but this isn't his best album),"T-Bone Burnett is a musical genius and everything he does is worth exploring. However, this album is probably not the best place to start if you are new to his music.I'd suggestTwenty Twenty - The Essential T Bone Burnettas a place to start and then expand out from there."
1,Hopelessly pretentious,"Perhaps the most disappointing ""erotica"" book I've read in some time, having heard of the award it won. Not sexy, not funny, smart only in that smarmy Mensa way (""look, look how smart I am!"") -- I have the feeling that it gets raves mostly from people who don't really get it and think they're reading something way more clever than it is."
1,Not even good for bad porn.,"This book was a waste of time. If this had not been on a required reading list for a college course, I would have trashed the book after 15 pages. Save your money and go to a peep show. The booth will be in a better shape than the writing in this book"
2,Not as shiny as advertized,Paper said it was photo white but is actually a more dull white. It is just a hair heavier than regular paper but is not close to being card stock. I was very disappointed with the shine of the paper.
3,NOT CARDSTOCK! LIGHTWEIGHT PHOTO PAPER,"I thought I was getting a great deal on cardstock, but the paper is shiny and lightweight. I'm sure it is good for the right job, but not for printing posters."
4,I made a mistake by not choosing the right paper but...,"It is still pretty good!!! I was looking for a cheaper paper instead of Bristol board. You only get 20 sheets for like 10 bucks. I wanted more for my money. I heard card stock was good, but I accidentally thought this was card stock!! I wasn't thinking...but after trying the paper out with my color pencils and pens, i was convinced that this paper is good enough. it is very smooth, light and thick. It is way better compared to regular printer paper....I give this paper 4 stars, but I would also like to warn other artists to not make the mistake of getting this paper for your art!"
3,"Paper great, packaging not","This is wonderful paper. I use it for making photo calendars each year. Unfortunately, all of the packages are open on one or both ends. So I must give this only 3 stars."
1,frustrating,I purchased this item 5 days ago and they didn't ship it YET !!So slow. It's not good customer service at all.
1,A load of fluff,"I bought this book a 2 years ago and after trying to read through the nebulous waffle, I put it aside. Recently I have been taking lessons in singing and wanted to look up some tips for problems I have been having. This book is chock full of cruft. Double spaced and wide margins. Pithy quotes by dead singers. The ""index"" is used exclusively for name dropping.I am not sure who this book is aimed at. The inner cover spruiks: ""The text provides a seven step system that demystifies the secrets to beautiful singing..."" Oh dear. Not at all. I was mystified what these steps were.How did an editor let this book slip out the door without a massive re-write and tidy up? Too many exclamation marks!There are some good books on singing out there. This is not one of them."
3,salad spinner,I love it.. But it's too small and nothing in the ad for it said it was that small.. Need to have more info.. Just takes more time to clean veggies with the size...
3,"Does it's job, not the greatest","It's okay. Doesn't really stay put on the counter when it's spinning....instead it kinda hops around. Does work with plenty of room for ample lettuce for two large salads. Really nothing to write home about, but it's just a plain old salad spinner."
1,Unreliable,"Well, I've had this salad spinner for not even six months and it's broken. The string has somehow detached itself from the spinning mechanism. It was gently used, and was used at most about twice a week.What a waste of money. I'll have to see if Zyliss will send me a replacement. Regardless, I'm never buying another Zyliss product again."
1,"Oh, Bialetti....how things have changed.","I have used a Bialetti 12cup every morning for the past 10 years until it died. I replaced every part possible and still no luck. Suffice it to say that I had mastered all the elements of a perfect cup of espresso/coffee, and now none of my fine tuning tricks worked.After months of frustration and trouble shooting, I gave in and bought another one. I'm not sure what has changed, but I can't get a good cup of nothing out of this. Like really, really bad. (again, I am not a novice. I know how to get an incredible cup out of this thing)So, with lots of regret, I have to send it back and begin a research project to see what my next espresso provider will be. It saddens me because I have loved my stovetop for so long. But, I am moving on...."
2,It's not working properly for me,"After reading all the great reviews on this product, I decided to purchase one. Well, it's only made coffee successfully a handful of times. Most of the time, it makes a very small amount of coffee (maybe 1/2 a cup) and stops - even though I've filled the water up to the notch like it says in the instruction pamphlet. Could it be a defective pot or is there something I'm not doing right?"
1,FAKE COUNTERFEIT PIECE OF GARBAGE,"This item is counterfeit. I waited two weeks to receive it and when it finally arrived, I opened the box to discover a blatantly counterfeit, low quality piece of garbage in an unmarked box with no branding (Bialetti or otherwise) whatsoever. Now I have the pleasure of waiting another week to receive a return label because the seller didn't include one in the packaging. Thanks for wasting my time, ""Tumble Trade Inc"". I've contacted Amazon to inform them that you're selling counterfeit products. Not sure how you thought you'd get away with this."
5,Makes great coffee; a little awkward to use,"I got the 12-cup for when I have guests, after I'd happily used the 6-cup version for myself for about a year. The 12-cup is perfect for making 2 nice, full cups of coffee. I found the coffee to be the same high quality as the 6-cup size. It is more than twice as big as the 6-cup and the size makes it a bit more awkward to screw together or wash. I also think it takes a minute or two longer to brew than the 6-cup (over 10 minutes on medium heat)."
2,After 6 months of use....,"The 12-cup model was working good for almost 6 months. I was happy with the brew.Then slowly the problem started. Now, it huffs and puffs the steam, but very little brew is coming out.Changed rubber gasket, filter disk, coffee grind, flame size etc. Nothing helps. I couldn't figure out what is causing the problem. There is no leak."
5,Coffee,"This is the best coffee maker ever, great for stove top, camping burner, it's a great start to my morning."
5,Excellent product,I have the 9 cup version and this 12 cupper is really nice without compromising the cup of joe. I'd recommend this product to anyone with a family or spouse that likes coffee too
3,moka,"Made great coffee, but rusted very quickly!! Don't make the same mistake I did and leave it in the sink with water; clean and dry it shortly after use."
3,Decent Coffee,"My espresso machine is on the brink and isn't worth the cost to fix so I bought this Bialetti as a cheap alternative while I figure out a pump machine. While the percolator makes decent coffee, I am not happy with it as a ""replacement"" for a pulled shot of espresso. The carafe is only 10 ounces (so each cup is a 1.5 ounce shot). The directions are clear except they leave out how much coffee to use and there isn't a line in the ground basket."
2,The 'classic' isn't always the best.,"Stovetop, 'moka'-style espresso is great. The bialetti is the 'classic' in this department. So, what's not to love? Well, the Bialetti is made cheaply, of aluminum and soft plastic. I've had several of these, and always end up burning them, melting the handle, or wrecking them in the dishwasher.So, what's the alternative? Well, stainless steel works great here. There are other manufacturers that build stainless stovetop espresso makers that are substantially more durable, dishwasher-friendly, and make the same great 'moka'. I'm a fan of the Vev Vigano, but I'm willing to bet there are lots of other brands that are perfectly good choices."
2,Buy the stainless steel one instead,"It's a known fact that aluminum causes brain damage. Spend the extra $20 and get the stainless steel version of this coffee maker. Also the handle on this device get very hot, it's not ""stay cool"" at all."
1,NOT recommended,"I purchased this and after only about 1 month of use, the inside of both the bottom water chamber and where the coffee flows into started turning a strange shade of purple-black and the coffee started tasting like metal. It had a weird smell, and the grooves on the metal seemed to hold in the weird balck tarnish. I tried cleaning it with everything, and nothing worked. I only used water and a dye- and scent-free dishwashing liquid before it turned black, so if I caused this, then why would anyone want to buy a coffee maker that tarnishes when you wash it??I don't know what caused this, but I am very dissatisfied and threw the whole thing away. ALSO, the handle gets SO HOT I had to use a dish cloth to remove it from the stove. Bad design flaw. You'd be much better off using a coffee press."
1,aluminum coffee maker,"This coffee maker is made of aluminum, This is not stated in the product description I returned it without opening the box. There is no place for aluminum cookware in my kitchen and probably shouldn't be in yours."
1,poor quality,"i should have it returned at the first.it leaks, it's brown and it's sucks.everytime i unscrew it to clean it, the strainercomes off.i have been using this coffee pots for over twenty years.i should have gone to kmart."
4,Bialetti 1-Cup Espresso Maker,"I received this as a gift and use it every morning. It says one cup, but is actually one shot of espresso, which is O.K. with me. I do recommend buying the best coffe you can and using good water. The only complaint I have is that the inside on the bottom part of the espresso maker is developing what appears to be rust spots. This does not seem to affect the flavor, but does cause a little concern. I am using a gas range and do not know if this is the cause or not. Other than that, I love it."
5,It's the real thing!,"This expresso maker is the real Italian-made thing, not a cheapo imitation made in China. I bought one of the Chinese-made ones and the handle burst into flames when I put the pot on the burner. No such problems with the Bialetti. Easy to use and clean, too."
4,Awesome South Indian Coffee as well,"Fantastic Coffee maker. I highly recommend this for making espresso. Its fast and easy and costs so little. The only hitch is that it makes too much espresso for one person. If you favour coffee americano (Espresso + water) this might be a good choice.I would recommend the one cup size if you make only 1 cup of espresso regularly. Using a 3 cup for making 1 cup messes up the coffee.---Relevant to Indian Style Coffee drinkers---this also makes amazing south indian style coffee. I would strongly recommend it to anybody interested in making good south indian coffee much faster than using the traditional ""filter""."
4,Compelling collection of short stories,"Kalfus' second collection of stories has a lot to commend it. The title story ""PU-239"" is the best of the book. Like all short story collections, some are very successful and some are complete misses. In general, I like the way he draws out characters and he is excellent at describing the movements that define a person. In some of the stories, I felt that he only had a cursory, historical knowledge of places and events and that made the story seems a little shallow. Overall, this is a worthwhile book to own and enjoy."
2,Disappointed,"Don't expect this collection of short stories to be anywhere as good as the author's first work Thirst. The first titled story was the best of the bunch, similar in style and technique to what made the stories in Thirst great. However it's downhill from there; you keep hoping that something interesting will happen but the other stories are as dreary as the Russian weather."
4,When you run out of Ritalin . . .,"You're probably buying this for a class in school, right? Well even if you drop out of the class because the teacher is some blathering bore and you just can't sit still that long because you ran out of ritalin and don't plan on refilling your prescription any time soon, KEEP THE BOOK. It has some of the greatest short stories ever written. And the range is amazing. Most of the stories will never feel dated. Stick it by your bed. Pick it up in the middle of the night when you can't sleep and your head is spinning. Read ""Signs and Symbols"" by Nabokov. You'll be stunned. Still can't sleep? Flip to Carver's ""Cathedral."" This book will keep you going for years, as you'll want to read many of the stories over and over again."
3,Review,"This is not the 7th edition so I cant follow my instructors when we reading the book in class.By the way the book is 60% new. Really old book.Except those, the book is still ok"
3,Another book for school,I had to purchase this book as part of one of my college classes. I never had the inclination to finish the whole thing so I can't say much about it.
3,Come *on*! Since when does Sonny Chiba do voicework?,"Listen up fanboys! Yeah, this isn't what you're expecting... if you've never heard of Sonny Chiba. The guy earns this movie at least a star in and of himself. The fact that he's portraying Duke gets it another star. And I'm kickin' in another star just to couterbalance the fanboy's rant. There's more out there than anime, and when you're done watching this flick (and you should, you uncultured otaku) grab ""Street Fighter"" (the Sonny C. flick, not that Van Damm thing) and the rest of the series. Watch some real people acting for a change! (hiding my copies of La Blue Girl...)"
1,bad,"The digital transfer is good but the source film seems to be badly scratched. Sonny Chiba is awesome as Golgo, he actually looks like the character. But the movie is laughable...zero plot, shaky camera work, awful sound effects. Be prepared to fast forward through the Non-Sonny Chiba footages."
1,Not what you think...,"Those of you thinking you were going to find the Animated Golgo 13: The Professional, beware. This is a live movie, NOT animation. I was very disappointed to take it home and pop it in only to find a 1970's live movie, and i'd hate for someone else to make the same mistake."
2,pretty bad movie,"Now Sonny Chiba is good in this but the movie is just horrible. I mean it could have been worse, but not much. The finale is just retarded.I had heard that the animated movie was really good, well I am here to tell you as a big time movie fan who likes kung fu and suspense films the most, this movie is bad.Picture quality is pretty bad but does have an original language soundtrack! The subtitles are unreadable but it still makes the movie more enjoyable. I would give this a low 3 ratign if the pictrue was better. But it is widescreened so we can see those very few actual martial arts scene in all of it's original glory."
4,Give This One Legs!!!,"Maurice Gray has done an outstanding job sharing the ""gifts"". It is contemporary and commands your attention. This book would make a great script. Give this book legs. Can't wait for the next one."
2,It's okay,"I liked how the book started out, but to be honest I didn't like it that much. I didn't like how the author attempted to ""school"" us on urban slang and dialogue. I also didn't like the way that the book flowed. At times subjects were jumpy and rather than flowing into a collaborative story where all the characters paths crossed, I felt dizzy trying to keep up witht he changing characters. Overall...the book it pretty good. I do recommend it, but it is not one that I would run and jump to buy."
4,Extremely Intriguing!,"Spiritual gifts are sometimes looked upon as archaic in the modern church. Many Christians think the Holy Spirit only distributed gifts during the early days of the church. In To Whom Much is Given, the author provides the readers with a glimpse of how spiritual gifts can be used in a contemporary setting.Gray uniquely creates characters that are very familiar in personality. Readers can immediately connect with the tight friendship between Donna and Yolanda and the silly male antics of Max and Fred. From the moment that Max and Donna have their chance meeting in the grocery store, it is non-stop action. These two fall into one adventure after the other---adventures that uncover profound discoveries about each other.Readers will become intrigued with a fifth character in this novel, a disturbingly bitter woman who seems bent on destruction. Her thirst for destruction and the growing relationship between Max and Donna add up to one suspenseful and thought provoking read!"
4,To Whom Much Is Given,"There's not a lot I can say about this book except that it was entertaining and carried a good message. I liked the balance it gave between the male and female characters and although some of the novel was hard to follow at times, the overall story was well stated and the author did a good job of telling it in a fashion that made it not be as preachy as some Christian fiction novels that I've read in the past. I liked almost everything about this book except the cover. Yuck! The cover almost made me not buy it and that's a shame because I would have missed out on a good read."
2,Sophmorish style but engaging story.,"Kudos to Maurice Gray for writing this novel. I commend him for weaving his faith into this engaging story.My favorite aspect of the book was the portrayal of a black male who is celebrate as a result of his faith and biblical obedience. He was a beautiful character to follow.As creative feedback, the writing style really needed help. There was just WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story and much of it (including the characters) so unbelievable. The slang use was awkward and there were several grammatical errors. I read this book because my 20-year ""little sister"" told me it was ""one of the best books she had ever read."" I only finished it because I wanted to be able to discuss it with her. I have to admit, it was a really choppy read for me.Maurice, my advice to you is to KEEP WRITING (and get a good editor!) The more you write, the better your writing will become. Obviously, a lot of people have really been touched by your novel. May God bless your efforts!"
3,Great music...not terrific sound,"This rare material, musically, is first-rate...great Texas 1960's rock.Unfortunately, the sound is not the best. Many of the mono singles have stereophonic surface noise, and the album, ""The Children"" is kinda tinny and there's an actual skip on the song, ""Sitting On A Flower"". What a shameOh well..."
1,Broken..Broken...Broken,These cups just aren't packed to withstand shipment. Half of them were broken on arrival. So avoid the hassle of having to return the shipment and just buy your mugs directly at Target!
4,Go directly to Target for best selection,"I agree with the other reviewer who suggested going to the Target store to pick up these mugs. I did just that, and found the very same styled mug, in Porcelain, (not Stoneware, as pictured above). Porcelain is a stronger mug, with a better finish which will not fade, stain so easily, chip as easily, nor wear down as easily as Stonewear.While the cost was a little higher, ($3.99 ea.)...I feel it is worth it. In addition, you get to choose exactly the number of mugs you wish to buy, as they are sold individually.Porcelain has one unique factor worth mentioning. The color is a really nice white. That is the only color it comes in. I believe this is due to the nature of the ""source clay"" used to make porcelain,(kaolin clay). Otherwise these Porcelain mugs are 5-star, and the Stoneware mugs listed here on Amazon are a 4-star. The Stoneware mugs are also available at the Target store."
2,this product is not good for someone learning Russian,"I thought that there were few electronic dictionaries on the market for an american learning russian, but figured this product would suffice. Unfortunetly, almost all of the word I didn't know and needed to look up were not in the dictionary, it makes beeping noises that you can't turn off, it offers no russian verb conjugation (or recognition of conjugated verbs), and only talks in english. i would advice students learning russian to buy something else."
3,Partner ER300T,"This translator does not seem to have many commonly used words. Also it can pronounce only those words that were preinstalled, unlike previous etaco models that could pronounce anything you typed. To add to that, pronounciation itself is awful"
4,Fair deal....,"Helpful in everyday life. But I wouldnt recommend it to people, who need a dictionary for professional translations or students.The screen resolution and pronunciation could be improved there is no pronunciation of Russian words. But at the end of the day I should admit that for that price it is a fair deal. If you want something advanced - you should pay more money ;-)"
2,Unspectacular,"The music on this 2-disc box set is 155 minutes of the most generic and uninteresting elevator muzak ever. There is not much point to this release as nothing at all of any worth is included. No themes, no melodies, just endless impromvisation. Hardly the kind of thing we want to pay the big bucks for. The 2 stars are simply because it's marginally better than theR-Type FinalI swapped it for."
2,Disappointment,"I purchsed this book a few years ago, and the music is too simplified, especially on her hit songs. If you really love to play, the book is worth it for the instrumental pieces, in which the music is more beautiful anyway. But for the most part it is horribly transcribed."
5,Case of Copier paper,"HP makes a nice quality of copier paper. Having it readily availablein a stack of 2500 sheet -- without having to unwrap each reem makesit a nice, convenient. Box top and side tilt for access keeps it stacked and handy."
5,HP Office Quickpack Paper,Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anybody could buy for their very own personal time and pleasure.
1,ARRIVED,RECEIVED IT.Great amount of paper for the price.I think I haven't had to buy more in quite literally ages.
5,HP Office Paper,"I ordered 20 lbs of HP copy paper which was on sale at Amazon and was glad to have it delivered. Among other things, I have used the paper when printing out colored pictures that I uploaded on the internet from my Kodak digital camera which came out great.I highly recommend this paper."
1,Totally disappointed...,"Typically, when print paper is ordered, it comes in reams. That was to be expected. However, this paper came loose in the box as if it had been dumped into the box. Many of the pages were ruined and unusable, some with finger prints on them. Many were filthy dirty. I would have liked to have known that it was going to come like this because I certainly wouldn't have ordered it. I sent you people an email probably weeks ago. This is the first I've heard from you. I don't intend to ever order any print paper from you again. Thank you."
4,IT'S PAPER!!!!!!!,"I cannot sit here and be quiet while the qualities of this fine product are besmirched. The nature of this product is sublime. The white ivory finish is almost hypnotically erotic. When you first rip into the box, the first sheet lays open, available, and pure in front of you. Virginal. The thin slightly glossy exterior calls out, ""ink me""...""emboss me"".... ""make me yours"".....From a utilitarian point of view I have to remind the reader that it's paper for God's sake. Think of all the things you can do with it - literally dozens of things! You can:1. Write on it.2. Draw on it.3. Make a paper airplane.4. Write on it.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12."
1,where is the other case of paper that I paid for?,"I ordered two cases of paper, and was charged for two cases of paper. However, I only received one case. When I looked at the package tracking, it indicated that one case was damaged and was not shipped. Why was I not informed of this directly? And WHY was I charged for two cases when I only received one? Please respond immediately."
2,Busted box - be aware,Turns out that shipping 26 lbs of paper in a thin cardboard box is somewhat problamatic. Ours arrived with the top busted off and the box taped back together by the shipping company. I assume this happened because the box was being handled individually and tossed from station to station by the shipping personnel and equipment. 26lbs of paper has a lot of momentum and that is a pretty thin cardboard box. So the top split open and spilled the contents. That box was meant to be shipped on a pallet not individually. The top 10-15% of paper was all dishuffled and wrinkled. We kept the box as I didn't want to hassle with returning it but I think I'll go back to picking up a case at the local Office[Depot/Max].The cost is about the same and I will get the paper intact.
4,Good cheap paper,Paper arrived on time and intact. The only issue is that it not in reams. And the box folds out so it is not easy to close. However a little tape fixed that. Can't beat the price for pretty good quality paper.
1,Hundreds of damaged sheets,"This paper is shipped in a flimsy cardboard box, and it's not separated into wrapped reams. Because the paper wasn't packed properly, literally hundreds of sheets are creased, folded, torn, or otherwise damaged. About 10% of the sheets are wasted, and using the paper in my printer has led to numerous paper jams. Do not buy this product."
3,Shipping! Ouch!,"I ordered this without paying much attention to the shipping cost, which is almost the same as the cost for the paper. I could've saved around $40 if I just took the bus to Office Max. DOH!"
3,Please Read the Description so you do not end up writing bad reviews like most of these folks,Apparently a lot of people do not read the description nor research items before purchasing the product. It is not fair to complain and produce a poor review simply because a customer did not read the description. You get exactly what you pay for...2500 sheets of lower-end paper quality in a box where they are not individually packaged in reams. If you are looking to be economical this is a good option.
1,Very Expensive and Poor Quality,"The paper quality is very poor - extremely thin, not your typical paper.Also the price is actually quite expensive.The Xerox 4200 is $31.07 for 5000 pages (versus $20 dollars for 2500)In summation, low quality AND expensive price."
2,"Good paper, only 1/2 case all loose not in reams.","When you look at the picture it looks like you're getting a case of paper. When it arrives it's a small box - about 1/2 as big as you think it would be. Inside is all loose paper - not wrapped in reams. The paper is perfectly fine, but I feel a bit ripped-off thinking I was getting a really good price on a case of office paper when I really got a bad deal on 1/2 a case of office paper."
5,Love Bulk,"Not only did I buy this product due to the reasonable price but also because I don't need to tear reems open, it's there. 2500 sheets is economical and will last me for a long time"
3,box of loose paper,"The paper is just what I expected, except it is not divided into units of 200 sheets in a paper package. When I opend the box, the paper spilled out of the falling apart box and onto the floor. Some pages were so bent that I will not run them through my printer. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have opened the box differently."
1,BUSTED BOX-STILL-18 month problem,"I didnt think I had to read the reviews for PAPER!!!!Flimsy packaging is still a problem,Didn't have to open package, it was open on R/S, with a wrinkled corner on L/S, which caused the loss of a few hundred sheets, but I needed to use the paper as I was out, and had a project underway. This was a problem 18 months ago, and should have been corrected! I am agood amazon customer, and would think they would have their vendors responding to packaging problems. It is too much trouble to return, as I need paper NOW!!This is NOT a delivery company problem, this is a vendor packaging problem that needs to be corrected, but, hasn't been for 18 months."
4,"Good economy paper, but could use better packing","If you're looking for good everyday economy paper this is good. The only thing, as mentioned by other reviews, is that it is all just sitting in the box. Mine was not damaged except like 4 or 5 sheets on top, but I see how it could be if it gets rough handled during shipping. Good value, but buy at your own risk."
2,Crummy,"The paper might be okay, but its hard to tell when it looks like the paper was dropped on the floor, then shoved into a flimsy cardboard box. The price is reasonable, but Office Depot doesn't pre-wrinkle their paper, so I think I'll go back to buying locally."
3,Paper too thin however usable,"I guess since I expected a better quality for the price paid, I was a bit disappointed. Paper too thin, however it does serve its purpose."
2,Terrible shipping box,It looks like Amazon literally threw some sheets of paper in a box and sent it over. They are not neatly stacked together and most sheets have bent corners. Only good for scrap paper at this point. I am sending it back and will buy a box at the local store.
5,The Notorious Notations,"As a big Lemony Snicket fan, being thirteen, my opinion may not matter much to anyone who reads it. However, I, like Klaus Baudelaire, have read many a more books than the average man reads in a lifetime. Having the reading comprehension of an adult, I say the book was utterly Snicket, a phrase here whitch means ""Nothing less than expected of this wonderful, and slightly misunderstood, author."" So I shame those who have given him merely two stars!! I have, like Mr.Snicket and the Baudelaires, have done a great deal of research on him, and some do not like his books, while others find it perfect for their taste. I am one of these people, who love a good mystery WITHIN the story, not a mystery itself. So for those who dislike Mr. Snicket, go read Pride and Prejudice, and leave this book alone."
1,malodorous misrepresentation,"It was in pretty poor taste for amazon.com to send an email announcing the publication of this book without mentioning it was a blank notebook. My son and I were very disappointed when we found it was not, as it appeared to be, really a book in the Series of Unfortunate Events. I consider it an unfortunate event indeed."
1,STOP!,"Amazon.com notified us there was a new Unf. Events book! Wow, Great, Order it!Not one mention that it is only a blank journal.Amazon, this is wrong!"
5,Exactly What We Expectedd - Great Item!,This was an awesome find for Christmas. My stepdaughter is a big fan of the Series of Unfortuante Events and is an avid journaler. This book is great with it's quotes from the books at the bottom (or top?) of each page. She loves it.
5,Anything By Thayer Is Good Reading,"Steve Thayers books are filled with intriguing characters, imaginitive plot twists, and always great endings. Totally Unpredictable, which I think is rare these days by many authors. Also Thayer's books are rich with history and interesting facts about Minnesota, which is more interesting than it sounds. He is fast becoming a favorite author of mine, his new Book Silent Snow is also a must read. As is the weatherman."
1,Poorly Written,"I tried to wade through this book twice and couldnt bring myself to finish it. Thayer's research into St. Paul's past seems mostly credible, but his prose to me is unreadable. I even tried to listen to the book on tape and had to abandon that effort as well. I would not recommend this book."
4,Intermediate to Advanced Nepali,"This is an excellent book for those who have some working knowledge of Nepali and the Devnagri script. It is dense, but well organized. The book alone may be a bit daunting for beginners."
5,"Free your mind, and your ass will follow!","In the words of Mac ""Dr John"" Rebennack -You can't shut the Fonk up! This is one fonky mixture of second line R&B, techno, and of course some of the wonderful early recordings of Alan Lomax. Not a bad track to be found here, but coolest of all is the final cut, ""Soldier"". This marriage of Hi-test Techno and Gospel on Steroids has to be heard to be believed. This cut alone is worth the price of many CDs. Sweeeet!Buy it, you'll like it!"
2,Weak and derivative,"This Cd is OK and very slick (esp Hangman) but for the real white lightning you should check out the source. The first guy to do this kind of work (using some of the same field recordings) was Greg Hale Jones, years ago, way before Moby, even.You can find the work on the movie soundtrack for The General's Daughter. or you can find him on iTunes. Great stuff."
3,Intensely matter-of-factly written,"What stands out the most after reading this book is the manner in which the author presents something that will happen to each of us despite our station in life.The author does a very nice job separating the philosophical, religious, and spiritual aspects that cultures attach to death by presenting a play-by-play rendition of what happens to us at the moment of death and carrying it forward. I would even offer that some people might say that the author is very sterile sounding at times in his description to the point of sounding clinical. However, I feel this adds to the effectiveness of the author's presentation and allows for the reader to add his or her own subjective evaluations of the physical aspects of death.I admire the book's approach in dealing with a topic that is often limited to hushed conversations."
3,Not Bad,"I had worked for a funeral home at one time, many years ago. I wish this book had been available then, since there were, and still are so many questions. More often than not, it's the family of the departed who want to know what really happpens and this book would have eased a lot of the tension. Morticians seem to have a mysterious aire about them, almost as if their work is a deep, dark secret. But there is little that is secret about the emblaming and dressing process here. The author covers just about every REASONABLE question one could have about the business. Anything further could be obtained through books devoted to the actual emblaming process. You might think this is a macabre little book, but undertakers have a difficult task, to make the deceased look as good as possible."
1,Save your last breath and $19.00,"Please don't bother. This ""book"" is akin to a poorly written high school term paper. The author gives no credentials and has strange views (Phlegmatic people live longer than active ones because they don't use up as much energy). Save your $19.00 and invest in a credible book. Death To Dust What Happens To Dead Bodies? by Kenneth V. Iserson, MD, is a well written informational book that delivers not only a good value, but an enjoyable, and informational reference."
2,Crap See Below,"Does not adjust at the waist, Crap, Dont Buy This Product unless you cant afford a better one, Probably ok for Go-Kart or small project or someone who does not mind frustration, I actually ran my truck into a ditch trying to buckle up last week, lucky the ditch was only 3 feet deep and covered in snow, O Yeah and i drive a Lifted Wrangler, Else id a been screwed.Dont Buy This Product, Cheap Construction, Not very adjustable, poor instructions, packaging was torn when i received it. Looks Great online, Not so great in my truck.Not the companies fault its crap, what do we expect in this price range, its too good to be true !"
1,Garbage,"Pure pulp fiction. Appeals to the paranoiac and hate filled conspiracy minded (I use that word loosely) among us. The fact is two or more people cannot keep a secret, so if more than one person knows, it isn't a secret. How some can think so little of their fellow man, is beyond me."
1,Anti-American Book that You Should Avoid,"This book tries to connect the dots where none exist. If you're one of the whackjobs who identified themselves as 9/11 Truther, like Van Jones, then you'll probably enjoy this book despite all the baseless accusations and pure lies. If you're a normal red-blooded American, you'll want to burn it."
1,An insult,to intelligence and to the memory of the 3000 innocent victims felled by Islamist fanaticism
5,Always want to read about how terrorism is growing everywhere,Want to understand how some people get into terrorism and giving their lives for this supposed cause.
2,"Think for yourself, and QUESTION!","I heard this guy speak. He gives a moderately entertaining romp through a lot of true information, and more. 95% of what he says is plausible (if questionable). Perhaps 50% of what I heard, I know to be true. But plenty of his stuff is a shotgun blast of information which only SEEMS convincing by its voluminousness, but in fact has no evidence. Take his (and Tex Marrs') claim about ""angel is next"". This refers to a threat supposedly delivered to Bush by moles in his staff, entailing a threat on air force 1, and nuclear war by compromised launch codes on 9/11. He gives a whole rapt story, with twists and turns and lots of insider details. It's not totally impossible, and could make fine fiction, but has no evidence whatsoever.There's too much crucial, true, and verifiable information out there to waste your time on this in-depth far-out fantasy garbage. I wouldn't trust this man to give me a weather report."
1,MISLEADING PIECE OF WORK,"Mr. Tarpley grossly misinforms the public in order to sell books, under the rubric of ""scholarship"". Yes, he went to Princton. Yes, he's knowledgable about history, but his opinions, his sources, his claims are highly questionable by any serious scholar. Of course, the conspiratorialy minded Tarply would say those scholars are all bought and paid for by the new world order. He can construct anything he wants, because he is a completely independent author not accountable to anyone or any institution. I would not spend a dime on this dangerously misinformed book."
5,AN IRREPLACEABLE SOURCE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH OF THIS DAY.,"As a physicist, and member of SPINE, I am glad that the government-sponsored repression of the facts of this day has not yet overturned our first amendment rights to publish without censorship. This is a critical source. Tarpley is a true scholar, and this is a masterful work; even if his intellectual posturing can be a little off-putting."
4,Courageous challenge to commonly held beliefs,"The book contains a number of challenging theories, the most challenging of which is the thesis that 9/11 was in effect a military coup by rogue elements of the US leadership, who had staged the mass murder of that day. In support of this thesis, the author claims that George H.W. Bush was coerced by Dick Cheney et al into accepting to play his role in this coup. The thesis is quite extraordinary. The author attempts to substantiate this thesis, but the evidence is rather thin and conjectural. Apart from this theory, the book contains, however, a wealth of information on the events of 9/11, which conforms with the widely held view that the events of 9/11 had been engineered by the US administration or some elements thereof. It is a must reading for all those interested in the future of US democracy and in the truth on the events of 9/11, even if they do not agree with all the author's conclusions."
4,Music to go to sleep by....,This Cd has helped my daughter who is 10 go to sleep at night. She finds it very soothing and just long enough for her to fall asleep. It works well for her!
5,"Hey look, I'm going to repeat everyone else...","I need only say one word this time, folks - Tremendous.I want to meet Uematsu to thank him for giving these great games the proper moods with such good compostions."
5,Uniquely Uematsu,"Nobou Uematsu is not just the greatest composer for video games, he ranks among names like John Williams with his incredibly versatile and powerful soundtracks. This CD, Final Fantasy - Symphonic Suite is a perfect look into both the urgency and poise of the battle hardened tracks to the ""soft as glass"" themes such as ""Prelude"", as piece for harp and flute. This CD is a definite must have!!"
1,the jumpitz goin groovy,"I asked for the spanish version, was sent the english version.The music was catchy for my grandchildren, but that was the extent of it."
1,Ineffective and overpriced,"After I ordered this product from Amazon, I found it the next day at a local retailer for half the price I paid on Amazon. Lesson learned. As I am typing this review, I have just killed yet another of the flying insects I bought the Neem Oil for. It is ineffective. I used two applications. The insects seem instead to THRIVE on the stuff! My plants look worse! My poor family has been subject to the awful smell of Neem Oil and I feel duped. I will never buy it again. I will have to throw my plants away along with the remaining Neem Oil."
2,"hmmm, don't know if it really works","We have been spraying this and garlic oil on our property to help with pest control - mosquitoes etc. I seem to be covered in a spray of it and yet the mosquitoes still eat me alive. The animals don't seem to be much happier either. I don't know quite what it is doing, but it isn't doing much.Heather"
3,Hard to Use,"I've used other brands of neem oil before with good results. This brand is hard to use. It solidifies at normal room temperature. I had it in the garden shed, so wasn't surprised when it got cold and congealed, but after heating it in a hot water bath and keeping it indoors (under the kitchen sink) it re-congealed, making using it more difficult to use than it needs to be."
3,Good price for product,"I think this is a good price for the product. So far, it seems to be working to keep most insects off my plants. It must be used regularly for a period of time before it starts to work, though."
2,"An enjoyable book, not strongly recommended","I found the book to be rather enjoyable, however I found that it got bogged down with mathematical number theory for the last, crucial, 25% of the book. However, I found that I learned much about the history of mathematics, and the lives of the people whom you commonly know by their last name."
2,A journey into history ruined,"Unfortunately, Mr. Aczel has lost a golden opportunity to bring out the history of mathematics and mathematicians. His vignettes are enticing but ultimately perfunctory and unsatisfying. He fails to connect the dots in a meaningful way and so the mathematicians he portrays remain both unrelated to each other and mere sketches."
3,Broad but Disjointed Coverage,"Aczel attempts to convey the mystery and history of theoretical mathematics in this book around Fermat's Last Theorem. The book itself is a short and relatively easy read. However, trying to blast through some 2000 years of theoretical mathematics in a way that the average reader can understand is a pretty tall order. Unfortunately, the book doesn't set up the theorem well, nor does it really do a good job in explaining why it was so difficult to solve. The key players, perhaps outside Fermat himself, are not well developed, and the conclusion of the book seems to race to a finish line without building up the underlying story of the solving of the theorem as a story.If you have some interest in the topic, the book might be OK. The mathematician will not find it deep enough, nor will the reader looking for an entertaining read. Instead, it is a superficial look at what may be one of the great achievements of 20th century mathematics."
2,close but no cigar,"This is a nice book which states without any proof or justification a fair number of conclusions. I bought it expecting something on the order William Dunham's excellent book, Journey Through Genius. In JTG, Dunham gives not only the tenor of the times and the theorems, but also derivations and proofs. Bottom line: if you want to see the whole thing, this doesn't have it. If you want just a cursory overview of who and what was going on at the time, this might be for you."
3,"Historical review, high school level reading","The first 90% of the book covers the history of the attemps to solve Fermat's last equation. Unknown to me, the equation had been proven for many interger exponents before the final proof of this decade. The book is probably the basis of a recent PBS, DSC or HIS channel documentory that got me interested in more information. The book is very easy to read - high school level for the first 100 pages and half of the remaining 30 pages. The other half of the remaining 30 pages were difficult for me to follow and probably for anyone else without a degree in Mathematics. There were spare illustrations and a few pictures of the Mathematians. I enjoyed the book for the historical point of view. It is certainly not the proof of the equation, (that proof is 300 pages long)."
2,"Interesting idea, wrong direction","I think a book about the solution to Fermat's last theorem is an excellent idea. However, I think that this book ultimately fails because Aczel takes too much time discussing the history of the theorem and the developement of mathematics up until the point when the problem was solved in 1993. More than two centuries of mathematics is pigeon-holed into a book that is under 200 pages. In that respect, I think that the author was overly ambitious in his aim; it is simply impossible to explain topology in 3 or 4 pages. I would have rather seen the story approached from the human, rather than the math, side of things."
2,"OK, But Not the Best Book on Fermat's Last Theorem","I accidentally read this instead of the book my brother really recommended to me, Fermat's Enigma, by Simon Singh. (q.v.) I subsequently read Singh's book, and it is MUCH better than Aczel's. This book tells the story, but with a bland high school textbook style, and with too much emphasis on the gossipy politics involved. If you are, like me, a non-mathematician, I think you will enjoy the Singh book (which is based on the popular BBC TV special about FLT) much more than this one."
2,"one star for the argument and one for the effort, but...","For those who read Italian: questo libro e' un'accozzaglia di brevi excursus senza legami fra loro. Quando avrete finito di leggerlo ne saprete come prima, al massimo avra' stimolato la vostra curiosita'.A collection of small notes disconnected from each other. Quite a pity."
2,A good story and bad art,"Personally I don't like this book because I like art. Now I don't mean to be rude, but the art in this book is....not very good. I think I made my point clear. But if you like interesting stories than buy this book."
3,ENTRETENIDO,"UN DISCO PARA ESCUCHAR EN UNO DE ESOS DIAS ABURRIDOS, ERA NORMAL EN ESTE TIPO DE GRUPOS Y DISCOS LA UTILIZACION DE JINGLES Y SAMPLES CONOCIDOS (ALGUNOS MUY MACHACADOS), CABE DESTACAR PARA MI GUSTO 3 TEMAS QUE SOBRESALEN SOBRE EL RESTO: FUNKY STORIES, TIME OUT y HOT FRAT SWING."
1,A poor choice for ACT preparation,"I would highly not recommend this book. It is very misleading and unprecise. The plan it provides is very vague. The English test is in the wrong format and some of the answers to the Math portion on the CD are wrong. It doesn't provide a ""customized study plan based on your test scores"" as it says it does on the back cover."
3,"Kindle ed review, specifically.","I am not specifically commenting on the storyline, author or book itself. I knew what this book was when I was buying it because I already owned it and enjoyed it. My issue is with the Kindle edition specifically. Throughout the entire book punctuation is omitted and missing, mostly periods. While this seems like a small complaint it is absolutely rampant throughout the entire book and gets worse near the end. At times I have had to re-read a sentence and notice a missing period for it to make sense. Sloppy work on the part of Amazon."
3,midleading marketing,"product works fine, is a good solid little featherboard. Beware of purchasing as per Amazon deals with 2 single boards as the 2 single boards do not come with the piece allowing attachment to mitre slots of a table saw. Extra purchase and cost of the split bars allowing them to be used with table saw made it an expensive proposition, not a deal at all!"
5,"Good product, good price, proper packaging, prompt shipment",I've been using homemade featherboards until now. This product offers versitility as well as good product design. My only additional request would be for longer bolts to use another spacer and featherboard on top for tall crown molding. Use these in conjunction with featherboards on the fence to assure workpiece stability when routing.
1,worthless,"When you buy it, you don't get the accessaries. Then you find out that for almost double the price plus shipping, you can make it workable. This company is making a point of bait and switch. They intentionally don't offer a working product out of the box. Its like buying a coffee maker that doesn't come with a coffee pot. Don't deal with them.It is a lot easier, with better quality to just make your own out of wood, that does a better job and you are happy with the result."
2,still made in China,"After reading all the reviews I still fell for it when read in the description ""Manufactured in Vermont, this classic thermometer is guaranteed for life!"" Stamped right on the box I received is ""Made in China"". My fault for thinking that maybe they were actually now making them in Vermont as stated in the description. It's kind of expensive for a fake."
1,"Inaccurate, not worth the money","The first unit I purchased had to be returned almost immediately. The needle would hang up at a random position and when I tapped the unit, it would then correct the needle position. I have given the replacement unit two years and it also behaves this way (not as bad). However, the temperature is innacurate by 3 to 10 degrees typically. I wish I had not spent the money on this product."
3,Works Fine .... If You Don't Mind Squinting!,This thermometer is well made and looks good. It's smaller than I had imagined. You'll have to squint to see the numbers and dial location if you view it from more than a couple feet away.
2,looks good but...,"I thought the reading on the left was Centigrades, but it is an unknown variable, I haven't been able to find out what it is."
2,Died after one year,"I installed this thermometer last summer outside on my front porch, in the shade.A year later, after the winter rains got to it, the dial has rusted into place and it now permanently says 68 degrees. So it gets a pretty poor rating for durability.Before it died, I was never quite confident that it was accurately reporting the temp. What's the point of a thermometer if it doesn't tell you the temperature?Waste of money."
1,Buyer beware!!!,"Quit after months. Very inaccurate. Constant separation of liquid in thermometer tube. I bought because I thought I could trust a local (Vermont) company and besides, it looked nice. Shame on me for not doing thorough homework, the company ( now Weims and Plath) for merchandising as "" made in Vermont"" (actually China), and Amazon for selling. I'm disappointed. Piece of junk."
1,For looks only,"This is a very nice looking thermometer, unfortunately the temperature is at least five degrees off. If you just want something for decoration it's fine but if you want to know the temperature buy something else."
2,Calibration ?,"I was excited about this thermometer when it first arrived. This is exactly what I need, nice and visible through my kitchen window. It is beautiful and ( mostly ) well designed. It had one major issue - this 180.00 dollar thermometer was off by a full 3 degrees. I have a high mechanical skill level, so I completely disassembled the unit and painstakingly moved the actual glass thermometer body to the appropriate place on the numbered strip, a process which took several hours. Very few people would be able to handle this operation. In case you're wondering how I knew it wasn't properly calibrated, I compared it to 3 other good ( small ) thermometers and then sat it in a 50/50 solution of water and ice ( which is exactly 32 degrees ) All my other thermometers appropriately read 32. If you want accuracy think twice about this thermometer."
3,Vermont Dial T-6 Brass,"I received this thermometer today and am pleased with the simplicity and relative high quality construction. However, I was very disappointed to see that the thermometer is made in China. The amazon.com review for this Vermont Dial Thermometer states very clearly that it's made in Burlington, Vermont. (There were other user reviews that stated the thermometer was made in China, but I assumed that this was for other items as there are six or seven different thermometers available on the same product page).I don't want other people to think that they are getting a USA-made product when they're not.UPDATE: March 2012:After owning this thermometer through a full year of seasons (and then some), I am slightly disappointed with its accuracy (it is typically within 5 F of the temperature at the airport about 2 miles away, but may be off in either direction), but otherwise it has been fine."
4,A bit overpriced.,Looks good. Easy to install. A bit difficult to read as he gradations are small. A bit pricey for the item.
4,I really like it. I just find I had to put it in a spot that is harder for me to see than I realized.,Please see above. I liked it. I just had to put it in a spot that is harder for me to see than I realized.
1,laughable/disturbing,"Was not described well.....its the size of my hand...it dosnt keep tempature.it constantly sais its. 45 degrees & cost wayy to much..if I wanted a toy I would have ordered a toy...Making matters worse,I was unable to return the almost 50$ item because I make my orders from my phone & was unable to print my own return address labels.....not happy @ all....it now someplace in a landfill,because it was put exactly were it belongs. IN THE TRASH"
5,Perfect for our patio,An attractive addition to our patio. The large size and easily read markings make it easy to check the temperature with a quick glance through the window. And it is accurate!
1,Is Vermont in China?,"I was very disappointed when I discovered that this particular T-6 Vermont Thermometer was ""Made in CHINA"". I own other Conant Brass products and have been very pleased w/ them. When this T-6 arrived, I placed it beside the Conant thermometer I've had on the front porch for years. It was reading off by several degrees, so I looked at it closer. CHINA was stamped on the back of the brass housing. The product packaging seemed to indicate it was made in Vermont, so I studied the box for about 10 minute before I found the very inconspicuos ""Made in China"" inside one of the Conant Brass trademark circles on the bottom of the box.Although Conant Brass didn't say it was made in the USA, there was that implication. The fact that the required ""Made in China"" label on the box was so deceptively? hidden really angered me. I returned it."
1,One star because no stars is not an option,"I bought 4 of these; three gifts, one for myself. Mine is not accurate and at least 2 of the others are not. The thermometer will read well below freezing when it is clearly above freezing, and this is with due regard to micro-climates, I'm talking about inches away. Many reviewers say their thermometers are accurate. I have to assume this is another instance of Chinese quality control. If I had bought these thermometers as decorative objects I would have rated them more highly, but I wanted to know the temperature. In this case I feel I did not get what I paid for. Apparently it's a gamble."
1,Very poor quality - after 5 years in Wisconsin,"After about 4 years the white face on this thermometer started flaking and is now completely unreadable. One day it just started peeling and flaking and now the needle will not move. The brass and all other parts seem fine but this thing is not built to last! We live in Wisconsin so it gets cold but, the numbers go to -40 so the cold should not hurt it?"
1,Not Well Made,Considering the high price for this thermometer I figured it would be well made. There are two fixed circles of metal. The outside is brass with numbers cut out showing the inside ring in a different color. I was excited because it was going down to -20 degrees and I wanted to see how accurate it was. Unfortunately the free spinning temperature indicator gets stuck. The outside brass circle is attached in a SLIGHT oval and the indicator hits it. Not fixable. Now I have to figure out how to deal with the warranty. Very frustrating considering it was a gift to my wife.Update: I was able to round out the brass circle. I now works well and is very accurate.
1,highly unreliable,"I love the looks, but who would put up with a pair of scales this inaccurate, even if the scales were great design?Conant: bring those jobs back from China; you must be making a fortune on this piece of junk in beautiful casing. However, you can only skin the cat once, and I will not be buying your products again.I've been looking for info to recalibrate this thermometer, but not having any luck."
1,Not made in the USA misleading,I asked for a product made in the USA. Vermont is in the USA but made in China is not.
1,doesn't keep accurate temperature,"looks nice but is sometimes as much as 10 degrees off the actual temperature. i have two other thermometers and when i compare them to each other and what weather.com says, they are all within a degree or two. then i look at the conant and it's 10 degrees warmer. junk."
1,Let me join...,"..the growing list of customers who are dismayed by the fact that this thermometer was manufactured in China. I owned two that were made in the USA, but one was stolen off my front porch steps this fall, so I purchased this one from Amazon to replace it.Mine came with no brass mounting screws, and the bracket seems rather thin and flimsy. But, I found two brass screws in my stock of screws, and after a bit of a problem with the flexing mount, got it up.But now I either have to take it down and return it, or live with the fact that the thermometer is not accurate and read about five degrees too low. On this, the third day of operation it is reading three degrees too high. So much for ""past"" good old American quality and dependability, so I guess I will have to return it before the return window closes."
5,Great Food no Delivery,Zero candy bars are the best. However getting them are another subject. I placed my order 9 May. As of 18 Jun I still have not received my product. I have contacted the vendor several times and they assure me the product has shipped. However after reviewing their other reviews it appears to be a ongoing problem. Buyer Beware! Get your Zeros from another vendor!
5,It works !!,"This is a replacement of a favorite CD lost long ago.Both the visual quality and the (most important) sound quality is ""as new"" and was delivered on time plus!! I couldn't be more pleased."
1,Don't waste your time,"Where do I start? First, it was a low budget movie. Not that there is anything wrong with low budget but, usually they turn out to be pretty bad. Secondly, it takes a good half hour or more before anything starts to happen. The hip hop sound track didn't help it much either. I would definitely rent it before buying it. Don't waste your money."
1,Worst of the Worst,"Save the box from this film for a movie you taped off TV on DVD. Then toss the paper and the DVD which came with the Box in the trash can . I accept a low budget film can have bad acting, bad sets. [actually the sets were OK], but there must be a decent plot [or some plot]. The plot was just plain non existant. It moved slow, and never went anywhere. What were they thinking when they made this. The film actually was some what professionaly filmed[ editing, camera work etc.], too for a low budget feature. It is just a shame they had no real script. I agree with another reviewer, it is one of the worst. Anyway I just tossed out my copy. I still have the box it came with , as I said though."
1,Finally! A challenger for the title,"This movie, if not number one on my list, is definately top five material for the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't tell you what it was about. This was just a convoluted mess. I've been in a few low budget movies, and just because a film is done on a low budget doesn't mean it has to be incoherent. I would almost bet that half the actors, and I use that term loosely, in this film probably could not tell you what the plot line was here. Don't rent it. Don't borrow it! Don't watch it on a dare and for the love of god, don't buy it! It won't even make a good coaster for your coffee cup."
3,Not that good,"I really don't think that the muvie was the best, the music really didn't go with what was going on, but in overall I would rent it if I don't have other options to pick from.*Sponsored Post"
3,"Nostalgic, Scary Movie but. . .",". . .this particular pressing does not work very well. Insofar-as it gets to a certain part of the disk and then completely stops. You can't fast forward or reverse. On my old CD player, this happens every time. On my computer, it happens sometimes. So, it could be a combination of things. Old player and/or inferior pressing/burning. Love the movie, however. Scared me as kid!"
2,Excellent transfer - mediocre film,"I had never heard of this film and seeing it as an adult mayhave taken away some of the fun of it but I fail to see the fuss orthe reason that Criterion spent their time on this. It is a standard50's B film with good acting but the story moves very slow and issilly without any fun or campiness. As for the ""specialeffects"", they consist of what looks like plastic brains onspinal cords photographed in stop motion. On the plus side, thetransfer is crisp and the sound is great. Extra features include aninteresting commentary from the executive producer and a gallery oflobby cards and ads. Criterion does their standard quality jobhere.... Only for die hard fans only, I'm afraid. END"
3,Shaky B-film from the 50s...,"Fiend Without a Face was made in the 50s when the threat of nuclear war was high and the fear of radio activity peaked. This 50s B-movie played on these fears as pseudo-science and CNS-vampires could strike fear in an audience. Presently, Fiend Without a Face can be seen as a feeble attempt to give the audience a shaky yawn. It is merely a historical monument of cinema history that offers an cinematic experience of B-film quality."
5,Essential horror film viewing,"This starts as a solid little b-movie programmer, with crisp direction, plotting and acting (especially by the fine Marshall Thompson), and ends with one of the most shocking special FX sequences in horror-film history. This stop-motion animation sequence, involving a gruesome fight between crawling brains and humans must be seen to be believed. Anyone who ever saw this film as a child may be permanently scarred, and all adults interested in horror sci-fi cinema should see it as well. Essential!"
4,great 50s sci fi,"This is the kind of film that used to be on TV real late at night, which I would watch with a friend who was staying over. This one, which is rather low budget, is really scary and mysterious. It starts out with an invisible creature, which is attacking people and seems impossible to understand - at one point, it cuts a tiny hole in a screen to enter a home. What could it be, one wonders? But all one can do is hear the sound of its movement, then witness the destruction of those attacked. THere some genuinely frightening scenes, like one I remember scared us so bad we shut it off: a guy is attacked and survives, but wanders into a meeting disfigured and moaning.While I found the explanation a bit disappointing, it is well done nonetheless, adding to our early mythology about radioaction-powered devices.REcommended for both nostalgia's sake and as a solid sci fi experience."
3,"Great Movie, Lousy Print Copy!","The imprint is terrible, even with an upconvert the picture is bad, the credits in particular. Clearly a cheap ripoff attempt by Amazon to cash in on this movie's cult status, too bad they did such a horrible job. It looks and plays like some cheap black-market 3rd generation copy on a cheap disc.I love the movie, but this copy is not worth $12. I'll be returning it and wary of any future Amazon imprinted copies..."
4,...... never sounded so good,"What really gets me about Fiend without a Face is the sound. The sound of the titular fiends sucking out the brains and spinal cords of their victims is delightfully disgusting. The picture quality is not quite up to the standard of The Blob, but you know Criterion did the best they could. Someone else mentioned The Haunting. I'd like to add to my Criterion Wish List another seminal, overlooked, and long out-of-print on VHS classic, I Married a Monster from Outer Space."
3,best brain monstermovie..& the name says it all...,"or 3.5 stars, good original movie w/ 2 cool scenes of action and the long final 3rd of best action. back then-as i was a kid-it seemed almost real w/ a real affect on me.best brain monsta movie ive seen of the pick. monster action i remember: brief opener after the fact soldier or security"" down, barn scene of 2, the mayorial house and the fabulous long grand finale. good premise and creature fx."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is without a doubt the worst ""Secrets of"" book in the entire series. An overtly extensive and unnecessary cultural background section comprises the vast majority of this book and it reads so much like a tourist's guide mixed with an undergraduate textbook that I wished I had saved my money and gone to the library instead. For anyone willing to sift through the pages of uselessness to find actual information of how elements of the Mythos manifest in Japan, I'm sorry to say you will be sorely disappointed as there is virtually nothing of value to be found. To be honest this book will be of some use to people whose only knowledge of Japan is that it exists but that will be only in the context I mentioned above. This book is useless and somewhat insulting to anyone with even the smallest knowledge of Japanese culture. A waste of paper. To avoid 100 SAN loss, avoid this book at all costs."
1,Not for runners!!!!!,Gun does not stay in place and rubs surrounding area raw! I run 5k every morning tried with this belly band and my 9mm sub compact. Had to stop 10+ times to try and readjust . Could never get it comfortable. It rubbed a hole in my side. I even tried sewing 6 in of extra Velcro into it in an attempt to make it work. What a miserable product
4,Nice package,"Ordered the large advertised as 36-40 size. I'm between 36-38 in pants. With two pistols & 2 magazines it fits ok. I don't plan on carrying 2 though, just 1 strong side. It's too large and as it stretches it probably won't fit anymore. Never know what the future will bring, I'll sew on additional velcro to make it fit right. If I get bigger later it will accommodate my girth... hah."
3,Not Quite There,"When I first bought this game, I bought it for only 20 bucks, but the first thing I noticed when I played this game is, WHERE ARE THE UMPIRES! You can hear them calling strike or ball, but you can't see them. And the batting and pitching is so mad easy, on the first day i struck out 17 Cleveland Indians with Pedro Martinez, and a few weeks later, I beat the Yankees 51-0! What a fake score! I recommend you only buy this game, if you have absolutely nothing else to buy."
1,"Horrible, don't buy","I went to the Palm store to exchange this item twice, and after a while again it stopped working. I should have just returned it, now it's too late and I've lost over a $129.00 that I paid. I didn't believe the reviews that were first given on this product, but I know better now."
1,Disappointed and can't return....,"The sound is good. The charge does not last very long. The carrying case is stylish.I thought the lightweight would be an advantage, but it turned out to be weak and not rugged.This headset is not worth the money. After using it for a couple of weeks the earbud kept shifting within the unit, making it difficult to use. The earpiece holder it comes with is a good idea, but also fails to hold when the earbud keeps falling out. The connection time to the phone is slow. Ultimately it is annoying and I had wished I bought something else."
1,mr.,It was broken. would not charg. I was not allowed to exchange it I had to send it back for a credit. I still want one!
3,good,"This product works fine with my phone when I am not talking to someone who has the same device on their phone. It does not have clear reception at times and I have to hold the phone close to it and it gets better, which should not have to happen."
3,Not a Great Resource for Beginning Guitarist,"This book has a lot of great songs, but a high percentage of them are in odd or flat keys, (A flat, B flat, E flat, etc) with chords that are hard to play and unfamiliar to beginning / intermediate guitar players. Also, their are a lot of unnecessary rapid chord changes that you have to simplify before playing. This may be a great book for an experienced musician."
2,Too advanced for a small country church,"The contents of this song book contain some great song titles, however, when trying to put together a small faith band in a small country church, the level of music expertise is limited and far below the level in this book. Even the guitar chords on many songs are far too complex.The reviews for these books should include samples of what the sheet music will look like. Most reviews don't even tell you if guitar chords are included!"
2,"Thin, not very good quality paper",It is nice to find inexpensive A4 size paper. The quality is mediocre. I buy A4 size to submit printed documents and manuscripts internationally. The low quality of this paper may not give a good impression.This is normal cheap bulk office paper in A4 size.
1,They cannot pick stock,I ordered some paper 8 1/2 x 11 and got 1 8/1/2 by 11 and two 11 x 14. I cannot believe it is that difficult to match paper size. Very disappointed and dont have the time to return this. If I am given two reams of 8.5x 11 I will be fine but will no longer order paper from this outlet.
1,AWKWARD SIZE!! BE AWARE!,"I ordered this blindly thinking the top rated/selling paper would be your standard 8.5x11 size... WRONG. The paper is longer than 11"" meaning I get to trim each thing I print. I truly haven't seen a paper this size before and will not be purchasing this again."
4,Not sure about this,"Although the quality of the printed work it's fine I always get paper jams. Something that never happened before. Then again I have an HP printer and sometimes these things are so picky and sensitive. But still as far as quality goes, better than expected."
4,ok product with reasonable price,"compared to other products, this one's price is a bit lower, but you have to admit that the paper quality is not high-end. i mean it's not super thick or smooth or gross. but for family use, i think it's a reasonable price choice. usually, i print coupons, recipes, personal documents with this, so i'm fine. but for business use, you might want to look for more decent ones."
5,Perfect.,"Fantastic service. Brilliant product, exactly what I ordered and wanted. I thought it was hard to get A4 paper, not anymore. Many thanks"
3,Not as good as I'd expected,"It says 99.9% jam free, but I had several sheets jam on me and ruin my document, so wastage and frustration there. More like 90% jam free. It also seems thinner than it should be for it's purpose. I'd recommend buying a slightly heavier weight if there's one available."
4,This is NOT 8.5 x 11 (Be Careful),"This is A4 size paper -- NOT 8.5 x 11 -- which measures more like 8.5 x 12!!!I did an Amazon search for 8.5 x 11, but this size got thrown in the search and I didn't notice it until AFTER I had made my purchase.Anyway, pay attention to the paper size.4 Stars because it's nice paper even if I can't use it."
4,printer paper,very good did not bunch up or slip. nice clear job of printing. will reorder this brand again when needed.
2,Paper Review,Just the basic quality. Would not recommend it on your laser printer. Got stuck all the time and it was a nightmare. Stick to buying good quality paper for all your requirements.
4,A4 paper,"If you need A4 paper in the US, this is the most economical packet available. Please note that it may be supplied by a warehouse that doesn't think at all about how to ship it! Perhaps it always comes with ripped packaging? I've received 2 packages - both ripped."
4,Big Thesaurus is Not for Kids,"If you are a writer or ever just need to grasp a new or different word, Big Thes 2.1 is for you. It's an interactive thesaurus and a great writing tool. It is set up as a Mac 9.X system extension and is always available onscreen, via a small menu drop-down at the top of the screen.To use, you highlight a word in ANY program - Word, Office, Pagemaker, Quark - it doesn't matter. Then reach up and click on the Big Thes drop down menu, highlight ""lookup selection"" and bam -- you get nouns, verbs, adjectives and everything else.It has 1.4 million combinations, organized by meanings, and up to 40 different definitions per word.When you find the one you want, you hit ""replace"" and keep on writing.It's nifty.I gave it only 4 because they have not upgraded it to system 10 for the Mac."
1,I paid less than $7 for this doll at Kohls,"These are great dolls and my 2 daughters play with them all the time, but I am sick to my stomach to see how much sellers are charging for them on Amazon. The dolls cost $12 on FP website. I got mine for less than $7 a piece on sale at Kohls. Please do your research and look elsewhere. Good luck."
3,Now that the first season is out SKIP THIS Rip-Off!,"The episode contained here is a very good one. And I can think of nothing bad to say about it. And the documentary is very good as well. But you get the SAME episode and the SAME documentary {no other extra's though} PLUS 22 more episodes with the first season set. If you can not afford the first season set this would be better than nothing. But if you can afford it, avoide this and buy the first season. Had I known the first season DVD's were comming 5 months ago I WOULD HAVE!!"
2,Real fans should boycott these piecemeal releases,"This is typical of a bad DVD release. It looks like a crude attempt to extract as much revenue as possible from large base of loyal fans. Some reviewers who wax lyrical over the 'special' interview features and ""insight into the show"" in this single episode DVD either work for the publisher or miss the point that any of these items could have been included in a 'full season' release. This piecemeal approach is frustrating for real fans of the series who, to date, have seen only one complete season released. I for one will protest with my wallet. It stays shut until the complete seasons are released."
1,Shouldn't be selling these,"This is included on the first season DVD. Using the word ""premiere"" makes it seem like it is something other than the first episode. I should have read the reviews - there is nothing new on this DVD."
2,Disappointing,"For those who saw the original version of this great film, do not purchase this adaptation. Many scenes in this film have been cut, the voiceover is all in English with no original soundtrack. I wish I knew this before I bought the DVD."
1,Messed up!,"I can't say for sure, the DVD was messed up. I hope I can find one that is not. Are all of them messed up or can I buy another one and not have to worry about it being messed up. I never had a DVD do what this one did."
3,"Not great, but better than Disney's 'Tom and Huck'!","Of all the Tom Sawyer films I've seen, this one stays the closest to the book. A little slow moving at times (not all the sequences in the book transfer well to film) but mildly entertaining. Some scenes drag on much longer than necessary. especially the fence painting sequence. However. if you can get past the voice dubbing this is a fairly enjoyable film. The dubbing is horrendous! Both Tom and Huck sound as if they were dubbed over by women trying to do a child's voice. It comes off sounding extremely ridiculous. Some of the scene transitions are sloppy as well.The actors have talent but again, it is overshadowed by the poor dubbing."
4,Comfortable shoes,"These shoes are great. The leather construction flexes and molds to your feet after only a day or two of wear offering a great fit. The soles are soft and keep my feet from aching even after long days mostly standing. The only gripe I have is the rubber that contacts the ground can squeak a lot when walking on non-carpeted surfaces. It can get a little annoying, but doesn't happen all the time and is only with certain very smooth surfaces."
1,Better off getting the stepper aerator,"Flimsy Chinese product, very poorly constructed. Does not dig into the turf deep enough to do its job. You'll be MUCH better off getting the step aerator or the shoe bottom types. At least they will help."
4,Good Product,"This is just what I needed for my yard...I had to add some weight to it, but it works fine..."
3,why my lawn aerator is just ok,"This product is OK, however I am still healing from the wounds I inflicted on myself during its assembly . It should also come with its own handle as it is displayed in your photo(even if it raises the price a little). Having to find a handle and then after two or three drills I got it so that I could use it but it is not as firm as it would have been with a handle made for it or a better way to secure a handle. with our a drill your will be at an impasse. If not a complete handle the use of C clamps vice the drilling holes and bolts to secure a handle maybe better?"
4,aerator,"Great product, does the work but the screws kept falling off and need constant tightening otherwise you loose all of them in the grass"
2,Doesn't go deep enough.,"Although assembly does take a bit of work, it wasn't too difficult. My problem with this is that it doesn't have much weight to it to sink the spikes into the ground. If you push it hard enough it does work on soil that is fairly soft already, but for soil that has compacted from foot traffic the spikes just glance over the surface. I even tried lashing a rock to the handle just above the spike wheel, but that didn't help much either.If your looking for something that will help with upkeep on a lawn that isn't having problems this is probably okay, but if your trying to repair areas that are already compacted you'll need something more substantial. (Since this does disassemble fairly easily and was relatively cheap I'm going to create a ""potato masher"" aerator with the parts from this.)"
2,Aerator too light........,"I had to purchase the handle and screws, drill two holes and install the handle. Then I tried to use it on my lawn. I found that the aerator was wayyyyy too light to puncture any holes in my lawn. When I put downward pressure on the aerator, it bent."
1,Impossible to use,The only way this tool would be useful would be if the ground was already loosened up. this is not realistic at all.
1,Rolling Lawn Aerator,Does not work on hard soil. If soil is already soft you do not have to Aerator.Trash. I can't give mine away
1,DO NOT BUY,This is probably one of the worst purchases I have made on Amazon. It does NOT come with a handle so if you do decide to buy this plan on spending $10 more on the handle and drilling the holes. Also does not work properly on the lawn. Needs more weight.
2,THE LAST HORROR MOVIE,"MOVIE CAME FAST AND GREAT SELLER. BUT WASNT SCARY AT ALL AND JUST PLAIN STUPID I THOUGHT,"
3,No horror movie at all...,"The Last Horror Movie tells a story about a man who kills people just for fun and senseless. But the movie is made like a thriller, not like a horror movie. Few gore scenes are quite harmless, no splatter effects! I think the Unrated Edition is as well as the R-rated, 76 minutes only. I was interested in the US-version because in Germany the 18-version is stronly cut: the run time is 67 minutes only!"
1,Garbage,"This movie is absolutely horrible. The main character is so boring that I didnt even finish the whole thing. I just couldnt stand anymore of this idiot talking to the camera. There are no decent kills, which is the only thing that could have saved it. I had read lots of good reviews for this thing, but i was very disapointed. I suggest renting this before buying."
2,Lions & Wildebeast,"This was a very good idea that became too derivative of similar films. Also, with the invention of the DVD this film's semi-cool twist has already been negated. Some of the writing is almost top notch, but not quite. The actor playing Max was certainly a good psycho, but Michael Rooker he ain't.If you've got a hankering for murderous madmen I'd recommend checking out Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and Man Bites Dog. Both are excellent films showcasing depraved anti-social human minds. Only after viewing those movies should you venture back to this one. That way you'll at least have a reference point for what the filmmakers were trying to pull off with The Last Horror Movie.P.S. It really isn't the last Horror movie, they still make 'em; so keep watching, stinkers and all."
5,A must see!!!,"This film deserves to become one of the all time cult classics! I would go as far to say that, if marketed correctly, it could and should be everywhere! Because everyone should see this film! The central character of Max Parry (Kevin Howarth) is holding a mirror up to nature, up to us!! Read between the brilliant lines and get alive to the subtlety of this film and what's really going on here. It is so, clever on so many levels, and it is brutal, and dark, and funny, and sinister, and chilling!! As for Howarth as Max....WOW!! This guy just doesn't break the fourth wall he positively shatters it!! A MUST SEE!!"
3,wrong running time!,"Yes,it's the uncut edition but somehow the short film was takin in on the running time.It's a great movie but I recommend to buy the special edition from Tartan-video,available at amazon.co uk."
1,Another Low Budget Turdfest,"Again I was tricked into sitting through a low budget horror flick. This time it was 'The Last Horror Movie'. With crap like this being put into the market, the true last horror movie probably will be coming soon. Its hard to stomach so much of the trash like this that is continuously released.'TLHM' has a decent nugget of an idea and tries a new sort of narrative(at least one I've never seen). While I give them credit for effort, its poorly executed. You'll see what I mean if you subject yourself to this junkfest. The film itself is poorly put together, poorly edited, and for the most part poorly acted. And being a horror flick, the violence was pretty weak. This was just a film that didn't need to be made.Maybe with more money and better resources the filmmakers could've done a better job. But as is, this is one to skip. Its just not good."
1,Horrible,"Please,these reviews where people are giving this movie 4 and 5 stars even 3 stars is to high. This cheesey guy with this english/london or whatever accent is walking around saying"" look follow me im gonna kill some one now"". They have nerve charging 22$ for this hunk of crap, thank god irented it first b4 anyting i watched no mopre than 40 minutes of it and couldnt go anymore, just absolutley horrible.I have learned through renting films by fangoria is a waste of money cause they all suck.Take my advice and rent by you buy cause if you spend what they want for this you will most likely be highly dissapointed. For $5 i guess it is worth the buy, well i wouldnt even buy it for $5 but if you cant find it to rent in any stopres and are that curious then the $5 makes up for having to rent but then you are stuck with this horible garbage movie you wont ever watch again."
3,NOT HORROR AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me start by saying that, all in all, this is a very good movie. However it pissed me off so much because I wanted to see a horror movie not something that was going to make me think. This movie was marketed deceptively. It was made to seem as if you would be watching FACEZ OF DEATH or something similar. Instead you get a movie that challenges your perception of morality and forces you to evaluate BLAH BLAH BLAH. Who cares I wanted to see gore. What ever happened to mindless gore, like Friday the 13th.Yea this movie is good but IT CERTAINLY ISN'T HORROR at all. There was TOO MUCH time spent on this guy's boring life. The death scenes are laughable. Although I will say kudos on the fire scene that really creeped me out.If you are looking for gruesome death scenes ( like you are led to believe there are) stay away. If you want to see something different, then pick it up."
2,This Was NOT Scarey,"Here's the good:1) This film has an unique concept by having the serial killer filming himself documentary style.2) The acting by the victums was very convincing.3) I only rented this and didn't buy it.Here's the bad:1) The biggest problem is the killer talks 90% of the time and begins to grind on your nerves after 15 minutes.2) The lead actor was not convincing, therefore making you always conscious that this is all make believe.3) Most importantly, this is NOT scarey!"
2,A little hard to see the symbols on the screen,"My nephew needed help with this simple toy. He is 7 but had a hard time making out the too-light symbols on the screen. As a result, the game was too hard for him to manipulate, even though he found the concept of raising a little creature interesting."
1,Broke almost immediately,I used this hard drive for two weeks before it suddenly stopped working with no warning. The drive stopped showing up on my computer when it was plugged in.
1,Drive crashed with less than a year of use.,"Yeah, I could try to use the warranty, but with shipping and hassle I think it is easier just to mentally note that Fantom is on my ""never buy again"" list and buy a name brand drive to replace it.I was using this as extra space on a DVR drive and it didn't last a year in a well ventilated cool spot on the floor near my tv.It is just junk."
2,in for service,"My Fantom Drive installed correctly, ran quietly and transferred data, but it kept stopping. So it has been sent in for service. Shipping costs for me negate the advantage of buying online."
4,Drive runs warmer than my other external drive.,Great value. True Plug & play. I emailed tech support since drive ran considerably warmer than another external drive I have.Tech said I shouldn't be concerned and could turn drive off when not actually in use if I was concerned.
1,Doesnt Work,I bought this external drive and after a month of daily use at my office its dead. Now the drive doesnt start. Never buy this drive it would crash in a short time.
1,bad design,"My mistake - but the drive let me plug the USB cable in the wrong way. The cable plugged in the wrong way without giving me any tactile warning - I did not have to force it in at all. Now the drive is dead. The pretty blue light still glows, but all my data is gone, gone, gone. I say the design is bad because there is no excuse for allowing such a trivial (but predictable) error to destroy the entire box --- after all, people buy these drives for backup!!! A quality drive would 1) have some type of electronic safeguard in place to sense when the cable was inserted in the wrong orientation, and 2) have a tighter fit for the cable, so that if the plug is upside down, then it will be obvious that something is not right."
1,Not necessary,"There is 1 PDF file for the discussion guide. It is fair, then the videos are only out-takes. Not really what I would consider a valuable Study Resource. Especially for the price. There are several discussion guides for the book Crazy Love online for free."
3,Good to get people talking,"These videos do a great job setting the stage for each chapter. They have nice music and Francis Chan has some great comments. His two or three ice breaker questions are good, but there are probably better ones out there. My biggest beef is that the videos are basically it. There is not much material included. A nice set of handouts would be nice.The book is great and having this DVD doesn't hurt anything, I just felt it wasn't worth the cost."
4,I love Crazy Love!,"I read Crazy Love, and I love the way Francis Chan presents the Truth clearly and unapologetically and straightforward. I have recommended the book as a small group study to anyone who will listen. Now, the DVD only enhances the book and will aid in small group study experience. Short clips for the chapters with questions following each clip promote discussion within the group. Even if you are reading the book on your own, without a group, the DVD is a great resource to use with the book for your own personal growth. Buy the book! Buy the DVD!"
2,Fact filled but dry account of the universe around us.,"This book, like most of the other non-fiction books Asimov has written, is a bit dry. It covers all the relevant information you need to know about the universe (in 1966)"
4,A thought-provoking look at women's roles in Performance Art,"This book is amazing! Basically, it's a compilation of interviews of the most important female performing artists from the past couple of decades. Fascinating, stereotype-destroying, and informative."
5,An inspiring book!,"I have been looking at this book again and again ever since finding it 3 years ago, each time gaining inspiration to be who I am with no appology. It and the women interviewed in it have inspired me greatly to push my own boundaries and explore society's taboos in a conscious way. I especially love the cover--an illustration of Medusa with pieces of culture's constructions in her snaky hair. Lots of photographs, which is a big plus!"
2,Wolf rotator,"Bought one after reading a great article on the company and its products in a magazine. My opinion? Overrated! Nice box and all but the rear compartment cover does not close properly due to poor workmanship. Same with the top clasp to close the cover. Does it rotate and work properly - yes. Winding mechanism seems to work so far but fit and finish does not justify the price relative to other similar products. If there is another similar product available, you could do worse by gettting that one."
5,A good DVD for collectors,"This dvd explores the various celebrities that have been in Playboy pictorials. From playmates like Anna Nicole Smith and Pamela Anderson, to 80's pop star Debbie Gibson, to T.V. and movie star Jamie Pressley. If you like collecting Playboy DVD's like myself or if you just like to see celebrities in their birthday suit, This DVD is worth picking up."
4,teaching tool,I used the CD for assessment review with nurses in LTC. The sounds were clear and the descriptions were well done.
3,Don't be fooled by stated size.,"The size of these towels is 31"" by 19-1/2"" - not the larger size described. These aren't the old floursack towels you could buy in the past."
5,nice umbrella stroller,"We have a 2 1/2 year old and a 4 month old and we wanted a double stroller without the extravagant expense. We chose this one because it is convenient to travel with due to its size and weight. It reclines enough that even my 4 month old can lay comfortably. I love the fully movable, adjustable canopy; it comes in handy to keep the sun out of my baby's eyes or to block the wind if necessary (with a blanket for added protection on serious windy days). The back lining also rolls up into a pillow and reveals a mesh backing. This is a great feature for warm days since the regular material is not breathable. Definitely worth the expense if you are tired of chasing your older child around the stores!"
4,It serves it's purpose!,"After my 3 year old started preschool, I had to take my twin boys 13 mos in/out of the school with me 2x/day. Boy! I immediately got this online because my back was killing me with the constant heaviness of my 'bigger' double stroller. This one is light, and serves it's purpose. We take this one most everywhere, unless we are on a longer outing which entails bringing 'more stuff.' This umbrella stroller is tricky to fit in lots of doorways, so I find myself going through the door backwards as an easier maneuver. Wish it had some compartment for storage, but, hey...it is an umbrella stroller."
2,Poor durability,"My husband and I chose this stroller for compact folded size and ease of use. At first we were quite pleased with it, despite minor inconveniences such as canopies that bent entirely out of shape the first time we folded the stroller. (Virtually all the other reviewers note the same problem.) After just one month of ordinary use on city sidewalks, however, the stroller frame became so warped that we had to throw the whole thing out."
5,I loved this book,"And I've never forgotten it. It helped shaped my view of life, and it expanded my understanding of the universe. Right now I am watching a documentary on PBS, Lord of the Ants, about E.O. Wilson, and sociobiology. If you are interested in the diversity of species, the book is a lot of fun, and very interesting. When I read it, I had not yet developed my fascination for ants, and I was not as educated at the time, so for me, learning about chemical communication was something that really turned a light on in my head. However, the book is fictional. Anybody who posts a negative review, as if the book was factual, would be in error. There are parts that are true, and there is enough of a wonderful story to stir the imagination and get one thinking."
