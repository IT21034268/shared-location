2,Stick to modern settings!,"I read this book because I've read other works by Patricia Cabot (who also writes under the names of Meg Cabot, Meggin Cabot, and Jenny Carroll). I like most of her other work but this book irritated me because the historical detail was just so poorly researched. No one in England (particularly in the nineteenth century) would say ""school"" when they meant ""university"" (for Oxford, ""college"" would be the only appropriate term). Nor would an English person talk about ""fall"" when they meant ""autumn"". Nitpicky perhaps but these and dozens of other errors really spoilt my enjoyment of the book. If Ms Cabot is going to write in historical settings she should do some research - or stick to modern settings, where she does shine. If you like historical accuracy in your historical romance, try someone else, like Barbara Hambly."
2,One Man's Meat ...,"There had been a struggle inside me before I wrote this review. I thought I couldn't misss when I saw so many people raving about it. I'm actually afraid to state my own view after reading. Is there something wrong with me or what? The fact is, I find the story silly and the characters shallow and the style not to my taste. This is my humble opinion and I do not mean to offend."
2,Bad digital copy.,"I am not very far into the Kindle version of this book and it is not good. The text is missing spaces in between words. This has not just happened once or twice, but fifteen or so times and I have only been reading for ten minutes.The story seems entertaining thus far, but the editorial errors are very distracting.I would not recommend buying this one for your Kindle."
5,Healthy outlook,"This is a great book about keeping youth sports in perspective. Dr. Stricker does an excellent job of explaining the physical and mental stages a child goes through from toddler to the teen years. If little Johnny can't hit the ball when he is four, this book helps explain why he has trouble at that age. If you have children in athletics or are a coach of children, then I would highly recommend reading this book.It will give you a reality check. Hopefully, this book will make you and your child enjoy his/her sports activities more."
1,Not what it seems!!!,This is my first review and the only reason why I'm writing is because I hate this product so much.There are many reviews of jewelery products that say that the items are different from the pictures... But these guys take it to another level: the thing they sent me has nothing to do with the picture!!!I'm going to return it but my advice to you is: save your money and your time!!!
5,do not believe the movie,"the howling 3 the movie is NOTHING whatsoever like the book. if fact, the only thing the movie and the book have in common is the title. the book starts off with a pack of werewolves in the town barn, and the pack leader, Derek, wants to reveal the town's secret to his 15 year old son, since Derek believes he is old enough now. well, a neighboring town comes along on the outside and burns the barn, leaveing a number of the town escaping, and Derek's son missing...and quite confused. i find this book extremely good, especially with brandner's descpritive overtone with the werewolf transformantions and the such. it's been an inspiring book for me personally"
4,What ever happened to Earl Anderza?,"This CD is excellent and makes you wonder why this great alto player was never heard from again. In fact I have never even seen his name on another piece of jazz music--not even as a sideman. This disc makes you want more. If anyone knows what happened to this man, a lot of jazz fans would love to know. I recommend this CD to all jazz collectors. Anderza had a very unique style and a superb command of the altissimo register of the alto sax."
3,Wasn't the one for me,"It could have been that the ties-in here weren't my kink, but I didn't enjoy this title as much as I'd hoped. Millie, our heroine, ventures into the naughty-film industry through a connection in naughty-photos. She makes and loses friends and compatriots; she has a brief stint as a mistress in a ""house of correction,"" and falls in love along the way. Alas, I really didn't like Millie as a character, and found some of the decisions she makes to be implausible. There is exploration of other issues, including Millie's relationship with her female tutor-turned-lover. The plot synopsis on the back cover hints at more BDSM content than is actually in the text, which had been what I'd been looking for; this could be why I was disappointed."
3,Bueno,"Fácil de leer, la historia engancha, guarda algunas sorpresas por buen tiempo. Por otro lado la novela pudo tener menos páginas durante la excavación, considero inverosímil la forma de actuar de Clara luego de conocer la verdad sobre su abuelo y Gian Maria tampoco hace un papel creíble.De todas formas me gustan las novelas de Julia Navarro, sus dos novelas anteriores son mejores que ésta:-La sangre de los inocentes / Blood of the Innocents (Spanish Edition)-Hermandad De La Sabana Santa (Best Selle) (Spanish Edition)Pienso leer su última novela próximamente:-Dime quien soy (Vintage Espanol) (Spanish Edition)"
2,mmm....,"I expected so much more from this book, especially after the Author previous one ""The Brotherhood of the holy shroud"". The truth is, for moments, it is even boring, the last third of the book I was only scanning so I could reach the end. More that 700 pages and the end is completed in only 20 and, above all, terribly bad. I will read the next book from this Author but if it is not more like the first one, it would be the last one I read. I wouldn't recommend this book.Español:Esperaba mucho mas de este libro, sobre todo después de leer la obra anterior ""La Hermandad de la Sabana Santa"". La verdad es que por momentos es incluso aburrido, el ultimo tercio del libro ya no lo estaba leyendo completo. Mas de 700 paginas y el final se desarrolla en 20, aparte de terriblemente mal. Voy a leer la siguiente obra de la autora pero si no es mas parecido al primero, sería el último que leería de ella. No recomendaría este libro."
3,Good story but a little long.,Navarro's first book (Brotherhood of the Holy Shroud)was a good read. La Biblia de Barro tends to be too long (767 pages) and redundant.
1,False advertising,"I purchase 4 different fighter plane from this company for my [...] year old for christmas. I was very unhappy/upset with what I received in the mail. The website has the product dimensions listed as: 9.5 inches long x 6.2 inches wide x 1.4 inches tall. These dimension are wrong. These are the dimensions of the package box. The actually product is a lot smaller, about 1-2 inches in length and width and half the size in height."
1,Cheap plastic and false dimensions,I have bought 100s of items from Amazon and this is my first review. I ordered the item based on the catchy picture and dimensions mentioned. What I recieved is no where near the quality based on the impression you get from the photos. It was made of cheap plastic and the dimensions were incorrect too like some other review had mentioned. Very very cheap and false advertisement. The small free toys you get with McDonald's Happy meal are better than this in quality..
5,Short but oh so right!,"Danny Elfman's often cartoon-like art of composing is a brilliant twist to this macabre and darkly-entertaining movie. Elfman sets the overtones (as well as undertones), by producing music that is whimsical and haunting at the same time.Although it is not as serious as following works (Sleepy Hollow, for example), this soundtrack is a delight. Never, at any point, does the music take itself too seriously. It further expands on the roots of ""fun genius"" that Danny Elfman established in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, and that he is still not afraid to let show (Flubber).The addition of the two Belafonte tracks was another stroke of genius. It helps emphasize Elfman's work as well as reiterate what was said and performed in the movie. The two tracks have deep ties to the movie (they were the main ""numbers"" within the movie), and needed to be included here.Beetlejuice is a great addition to any Danny Elfman collection, as well as fun for anyone who is just starting out!"
3,Exactly what I needed,"I couldn't be happier with this buy. I just needed a few songs from this soundtrack and hated to pay what the stores in town wanted...so this was a real bonus, good shape and cheap!"
3,"Almost, but doesn't quite hit the mark.","I found this soundtrack to be a bit lacking. The musical ideas on this CD are excellent, but they aren't played out very much. Because it is a soundtrack, there are great, gaping holes in the music, perhaps for dialog or something of that sort. The music tries to sing, it has the ability to sing, but just can't quite manage it. The sound quality on this particular CD isn't all it could be, either. Filled with catchy and brilliant musical ideas, one wont be able to stop humming the tunes, but listening to the soundtrack on its own is somewhat disappointing. All in all, the composer definately wrote a very good movie accopaniment, but it cannot stand on its own."
4,Dark and whimsical,"The music here makes you wonder why Danny Elfman stuck with (Oingo) Boingo for so long. While he may have had a few catchy songs there, his talent for motion picture composing is awesome. Certainly, he and Tim Burton are nearly inseparable (witness The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman), so Elfman's easy to peg. On the surface, it's tempting to say that once you hear one of his motion picture compositions, you've heard them all, but I suspect there's more nuance to his music that that. This album moves easily from the eerie and ethereal to the warm and heartfelt--often seconds apart. It's all dark, though, being music for a tart comedy about the afterworld. The two Harry Belafonte songs keep the gloom away, and add the perfect touch of whimsicality--both in the movie and in this album. It's hard to erase from your mind."
3,Good so far,The Cd is good so far because I only listen two songs on it. Day-O and Jump in the line.
2,A weak point in Ms. Dulfer's career,"I bought this CD only because I'm a huge fan of Candy Dulfer, and I bought it cheap from an auction site. It's interesting to see her making the transition from her sultry and nuanced ""Saxuality"" to the straight-up dance jazz of ""What Does It Take"". This CD lacks the coherence of her earlier and later albums, as if Candy were suffering from artistic growing pains. Happily, all turned out well in the end for her, but this particular album is too unfocused to really make an impression. Furthermore, some of the songs were jarring and gave me headaches.You won't be sorry buying any of Ms. Dulfer's other work, but I just don't have it in me to recommend this one, even to diehard fans."
1,so much for originality,"I once asked sax great Richard Elliott his advise to other musicians. He summed up his advise in these words ""sound like yourself"". We all have our influences, and clearly David Sanborn has been a huge influence on all modern sax players. There are droves of Sanborn imitators, but this artist absolutely takes the cake. Candy shows absolutely no style of her own, it is nothing short of almost scientific duplication of Sanborn riffs and tone. If you want Sanborn, get a Sanborn CD. True artists do their *own* thing. True originality means doing something first. Imitation, it is said, is the greatest form of flattery, but to the listener this is blatant plagiarism. I guess looking hot on the cover is enough to sell. Sad."
3,Candy Dulfer is SEXY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!=),"Candy Dulfer is not a very good sax player, but quite simply one of the most beautiful women in the universe!"
1,"Yep, the batteries are no good.",I was just looking online for where to buy replacement batteries and after reading the reviews here I think I'll start looking for a new phone. The batteries on all 3 of our handsets only hold about 30 minutes in call time. We were hoping there was a LION replacement... no luck. Please learn from all these reviews... you'll love the phone until your 1 year warranty runs out and so do all your batteries!
4,"great phone, but get a new battery","I agree with those who have had battery problems. I replaced all the original handset batteries with NiMH batteries about a year ago and haven't had any problems whatsoever since! I used Energizer ER-P511 batteries that I bought at the local Best Buy. I understand Panasonic may actually make NiMH batteries for this phone now as well, but they are not included with the new phones. I highly recommend anyone with this phone switch batteries... major improvement!"
1,Junk Phones,"Panasonic Phones, Junk, Junk, Junk. You can read all the previous reviews that explain why the batterys die. To replace go to Batteries.com, order the Energizer ER-P511 Nickel-Metal Hydride Cordless Phone battery. It's 18.99 each. We might just get a little use out of these junk phones."
2,Battery life,"I am not very happy with the phone. Worked fine so far and just 6 months later having problems with battery. It stays in the base all the time. If I pick up the hand set, I can talk for 5 min before I hear the beep to recarge battery.I have the same problem as M.Lewis, the handset seams to be losing connectivity with the bas station. I have to walk the phone back to the base station and put it back into the cradle for it to recognize it again."
1,Do Not Buy,"This phone died after just two months. Sent it back to Panasonic, and was told that I would be sent a refurbished/rebuilt unit, not a new one (wrong answer!).Other than the dying, and poor customer service, the phone is great - excellent features and great reception. Maybe I just got a lemon."
1,Very disappointed,I bought this phone after reading all the reviews including someone who used it in their barn. I need a phone in my house and want the 2nd unit in my barn 150' from my house. According to the reviews and literature this should not be a problem...I can't even use it in my backyard! Phone is being returned.
2,Could have been great...,"This system seemed to have all the updated features from the older 2-line KX-TG2000B until I got it home... the handset on the base handset can't be dialed from the base unit and the called number doesn't display on the base unit or base handset. So if you want to use the base unit you're stuck with the speaker phone. Worse yet, the privacy feature which prevents people from picking up the line had to be used per individual call each time someone called and couldn't be programed for all calls like the older version. Made it totally useless for a busy home office with more than one person answering calls, or for a busy house with kids who want to see who called.Our old handsets failed to dial the number 1 (and the # sign too)... but without a properly updated version we have no choice but to buy new handsets and hope they last. Panasonic seems to make the only small office system that doesn't require a ""server""... very disappointing for an ""upgrade""!!"
1,Don't buy it! Even at clearance prices,Severe problems. I have owned it for only 6 months and now cannot use the system because of constant background static that makes conversation almost impossible. Panasonic should issue a general recall for this junk of a system.
3,Great Features - Bad (Low) Volume,"I loved everything about this phone. Great base set with big buttons, easy menu set up, good speakerphones on both base and handset.But I had to return it!The volume on the handset, even though I had it cranked it up to the highest volume level (and the booster on), was *always* way too low and soft for me. I am not hard of hearing. It's a shame that such a great phone has one big flaw that, for me, makes it unusable.CAN'T RECOMMEND IT.P.S. The base (speakerphone) has five volume levels. They worked great. The handset (and its speakerphone) have only 3 volume levels. Maybe that's the problem- needs 2 more (higher) volume levels on the handset. It's also possible that it was just my phone that has this problem, but I haven't had good luck with Panasonic phones in the past, so I'm not going to try another one."
4,Get the new NI-MH battery for this phone,This has been a good phone EXCEPT for the NiCad battery that was shipped with the phone.We've had this phone for almost 2 years but after contacting Panasonic about the battery problem they sent out 2 replacement batteries.HHR-P402PED It's a NI-MH battery which means that you can recharge it after each use.The original batteries lost their charge and the phone kept losing contact with the base.We're very happy with the phone now and it doesn't interfere with our wireless internet connection.
2,good for less than a year?!,"I like how the phone functions, it was working lovely... I had this phone for half year and problems begun. It often lose signal when I'm not even that far from the base phone. The phone just dies on me time to time, I get cut off right in middle of my calls. I ended up connecting my old 900MHz phone to a phone splitter, so that I can at least use this panasonic phone as caller ID box... What is wrong with this picture?"
2,unhappy with this product,My review would sound almost exactly like James Han an unahappy user. We also bought the phone 14 months ago. At the time we paid$180 (base station & 1 extra handset) thinking that we would have this phone for years; givern the higher price. We were wrong & we were past the 1 year warranty. We recently tried to buy another handset to replace the phonethat is troubled and it will not work with the base station. I will seriously think about buying another Panasonic product. I thought their products were supposed to be of higher quality; we were wrong.
2,"Like many others, I'm finding it is an unrealiable product.","My first one was exchanged within 30 days. The first one would record voicemail garbled. The problems I have now are with the replacement unit. The handsets of the replacement unit won't hold a charge anymore. This started to occur almost simultaneously on both handsets after about 6 to 8 months. I'm finding the range to be poor. As soon as I go outside my house and turn a corner away from the base unit, the call drops. The volume is also rather low...people I'm talking to wonder if I'm talking into the phone or not (I guess this is a mic and not volume problem?) and even at max volume, it's not really does not get as loud as one would expect. It look like the first unit I got was a sign of things to come, I just wished I had heed the warning!"
4,one important feature missing,"You can only monitor incoming calls from the base. Which is a real inconvenience if the base is upstairs and you're downstairs.Good sound, lots of other great features, but if you screen calls, this is not the phone for you."
1,short battery life - low volume,"Wow. my experience mirrors other reviews i see here. after about 1 year of use, batteries in 2 of these phones have extremely short life - cant talk for more that 15-30 minutes. Note that there is a class action suit pending against panasonic for this series of phones. Also the volume on these phones is very low, you have to use the speakerphone to hear unless the room is extremely quiet. Very disappointing, especially after having a prior panasonic 900mhz answering machine that lasted at least 6 years."
2,Lots of good features BUT,"As most of the reviews on this phone system have said, lots of nice features, no dispute there.BUT the LCD keeps going blank on both phones, no LCD no features.Problem started within two months of purchase, was able to get the LCD back a few times but now one handset LCD is just gone.Low volume unless you are using speakerphone feature, which is very good.Range is very poor, cant get more than 75 feet from base and that is pushing it. In the begining could only get 25 feet but a reset of both base and handsets got it out to the 75 with booster.Have to get handsets back for repair before warrenty runs out.Not happy."
1,Do NOT buy this phone,"The is the absolute worse consumer electronics product I have EVER purchased. I've just order the 3rd set of batteries for my handset, reception and range are terrible, voice quality is the worse of any phone I've ever owned. Read the other reviews - don't buy this phone. My guess is, anyone listing a positive review just bought this piece of junk and doesn't know better - yet.Panasonic has totally blown it. I'll never buy another of their products - period."
2,Not happy with this phone,"I have used this phone for 8 months and will be replacing it soon. The reception on the 5.8 Ghz frequency is no better than the 900 MHz phone also used in the house. But, the worst part is that callers have trouble hearing me speak on the handset. Seems I am too quiet to be heard easily. This has been the case for half the callers on this phone. I will be going back to a land line and not use a wireless connection."
4,"Useful and effective; amongst the best, imo.","I use this book with clients in counseling. It's logical, practical, and has relevant assessments and exercises. I've used others (Ellis, Lerner, McKay [also good], Hightower, Gentry and more) but have found this one most effective. It's working from a basic CBT paradigm but touches on awareness, communication and conflict resolution, and family systems. I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, because I like that much, but Amazon does allow half-stars. I've yet to read a book that addresses all aspects of anger fully so I don't give it 5 stars but it's close."
2,"not bad; but certainly not great, either.","This was an interesting book. It tried to give you the entire history of frankenstein. This means how it afects you in every way since it was written. A nice idea, but not well written. It is long and a little boring. It is also repetitive. It reads more like a phone book, than a non-fiction literary work. I was not pleased at all. In fact, I would not purchase anything else by this author(Mr. Jon Turney) ever again. I thought he could have been a lot more interesting and exciting, if he had really tried."
4,Rare insight into Madagascar,"I had the great pleasure (and fortune) to meet Alison Jolly during my visit to Berenty in September 2003.She graciously and eloquently addressed our small tour group and gave us a rare insight into her understanding of lemur behaviour.The book is an absolute must for anybody with even a passing interest in Madagascar, anthropology and lemurs.Most importantly, it documents this remarkable family (the de Heaulmes) and sheds light on the complex and mysterious history of Berenty and its part in the modern history of Madagascar."
4,Stories about a special place.,"Alison Jolly is a wonderful story-teller and makes Malagasy Madagascar and old French Madagascar come to life. The reader learns about a particular corner in southern Madagascar and the lives of its native tribes and French colonialists.Lemurs brought Alison Joly to Madagascar but the fascination for this reader was her evocative portraits of people. Zebus and sisal rather than lemurs seem more relevant to her tale, until Prince Philip arrives and appears to shock an uncaring government that the country is committing ecological suicide. There is now a new government and it may be taking the environment more seriously. That would be a change in Madagascar!As a former resident of Madagascar, I loved the book and the way Alison Jolly brings the place to life."
3,Not What I Expected,"As a biologist, I was hoping for more Lemur biology than what I got. This book is an excellent history of Madagasacar, without a doubt, and includes detail I am sure is found nowhere else. If one were planning a trip to Madagascar, this would be a perfect primer.However, I was hoping for more of a biological approach regarding the Lemurs, their society, behavior, etc. While I did get a taste, it wasn't enough.Sorry to admit, I got just over half way through the book before I lost interest."
3,"Interesting, but somewhat empty","There's something real menacing in the vibe on Peter Kruder's ironically monickered solo debut. For that reason, I can't find the music here as beautiful as what's on past Kruder & Dorfmeister releases. Then again, any Kruder and/or Dorfmeister find is one worth buying. I guess I expected another ""G-Stoned"" kind of release, but greatness is a rare thing, isn't it? The big let-down here is ""Shining,"" a Velvet Underground-inspired ballad that sounds too pretentous to take seriously. The rest is interesting fodder for any head's late-night stoner sessions. And, at the very least, it's enough to whet our appetite for K&D's impending full-length debut."
2,Disapointing,"Honestly, I was disapointed. ""Who am I"" is great, but otherwise I thought the CD was just plain and even boring. It's the typical music you'd hear in a lounge/bar but wouldn't even notice because it sounds so much like all the other stuff out there."
2,Stay clear unless you are REALLY SQUARE...,"yikes... way, waY WAY to slick and over produced... Its all just like muzak really. Stay clear unless you are REALLY SQUARE..."
5,DA BOMB!!!,"I have to say that once I heard this disc, it made me think, ""what else have I been missing?"" I never realized that such enveloping music existed. I had never heard anything like this before, and as soon as I had, I was hooked. Anyone would like this. I have showed it to a variety of people who all have different tastes in music, and everyone loves it. There is no way for me to describe how excellent this CD is. I have had it for 5 months now, listen to it faithfully, and am still not sick of it. To anyone who has come across this disc and is reading this review, BUY IT. You will not be sorry. You wouldn't be reading this if it wasn't related to what you wanted."
5,"beautiful, sexy, trippy...","i purchased this cd after reading the great reviews it's received.. and was amazed that the reviews weren't even better. the cd is fantastic - truly. captivating, transporting, and wonderful. It's so nice to buy something online - without having previously heard it - and have it exceed expectations. i was already a kruder/dorfmeister fan... but this just solidified my conviction of their brilliance. buy it with dorfmeister's Different Tastes of Honey, and you'll be in for a treat."
5,Peter Kruder is the saivor of electronic music...,"and this album is 100% proof of this fact. I have owned this cd for about a year, and I am still listening to it, uncovering new layers of music. Straight off, Kurder captivates you with ""The Man Part 1"", drums and etherial sounds paving the way and welcoming you to his mind. From there, every other track stands out as unique and individual. I cannot pick out a favorite track because I cannot just listen to one track alone, they each compliment another, flowing beautifully from one to the next (however this is not a mix album). This album comes highly recommended and compliments any cd collection. Also, concerning those people that have only heard ""Who Am I"" (from the Animatrix) clearly did not listen to the entire album with a critical ear. If you are just expecitng ""Who Am I"", I promise you that Kruder will blow past your expectations and create an image of musical beauty that is rarely matched by any other electronic artist in the world today."
4,Why?,"Why? Why can't my own tracks come out that perfect? How many dollars must one spend, how many years must one work behind a mixer, what voodoo must one muster; Peter Kruder apparently knows.Some things, you just have to actively listen (perhaps on headphones, even) to appreciate all of the nuances of the recording, the performance, the production. Other things allow you to be more passive, letting the music seep silently into your soul from the background. Peace Orchestra give the choice between the two, equally enjoyable as either.I try (as do many others, I assume) to get this kind of three-dimensional sound. This album lets you close your eyes and be taken far away into the various caverns in which it sounds as if it was recorded in, often to many different ones at the same time. Stereo at it's finest."
4,More Kruder than Dorfmeister,"upon listening to this, i realized ""hey, there's more kruder than dorfmeister in k&d"". the sound is like another reviewer said, a somewhat stripped down k&d. all the tracks are masterfully arranged, and all possess that characteristic ""kruder squelcherific"" sound, present on k&d sessions. i recommend this if you like stripped down rolling jazz, with dark melody. definetely a quality work, and a labor of love from the man from vienna."
4,Watermelons?,"Yup, watermelons. A lot of them. As in a whole island. See, Kuno goes there to train for his next fight with Ranma, and comes for his opponent wearing a watermelon on his head. And he has amnesia. He gets Ranko (Ranma's female side) to the island, where she is knocked unconscious. She has a very funny dream too! Anyway, I forgot what happens in the rest of the book, but I liked the watermelon segment!"
5,un manga culte,"Ranma 1/2 est un des mangas cultes de ma génération. Rumiko Takahashi a crée un super manga qui est accessible à tous les ges et qui est basé sur des histoires quelques fois farfelues et sur une bonne dose d'humour.En bref, c'est pour tout le monde."
4,What a ride!,"This book is crazy. I laughed myself silly. Ian James Foster and his friends are out of control and do things I would never even begin to imagine. Like the night he and his friend, the Gouche, went out and stole Christmas. Or how he and Charlie Downing moved to California, but accidently wound up living in Colorado with some strange Mexican woman who they were dumped on, at 3:00 in the morning. I really felt sorry for that drag-queen Tiffany. What they did to her was awful, but I found myself laughing then too. From beginning to end, as it says on the cover, ""This ain't no story, this is a trip!"" It really was and I loved every minute of it."
1,Offensive Kindle Pricing,"I would like to add this item to my library of information on Curacao, but %92.00 for a Kindle eBook is not only excessive, it's offensive."
1,A bit boring,"This book bored me. It had too much politics in it and not enough passion. There wasn't enough dialogue between the two main characters. The main characters seemed wooden and there were too many family members which got really confusing, too many names had me going back to see which child belonged to who.Romance novels are supposed to centre around the main characters and to develope their relationship. This book centred around politics. A romance novel should make us want to be one of the characters. The reason I think we read these sorts of books is to escape reality for a few hours, to dream a little. This book depressed me. I would have hated to have been one of the characters. This book lacked humour, passion and emotion between the main characters and gave me a tension headache!Give this one a miss."
4,A good listen,"Wow - some mixed reviews here. Have to say if you are a fan of ""the voice"" you will be a fan of this. Great music to sing along to and a smooth voice singing it. If you want the originals, buy the originals! If you want a nice grouping with a superb voice, this is it.Look for a new group of R&B; covers with 3 new originals from Michael 3/11/8. ""Soul Speak"" has already charted 3 songs simultaneously on Billboard the first week of singles release so once again - you'll like it."
4,"Yeah, it's slick. You got a problem with that?","Okay, I've read the critiques. It's true: On ""Motown"" Michael McDonald doesn't capture the raw energy of the original classics. These covers are so polished you can see your reflection in them.So what's the problem? The sound is rich. The ""goosebump factor"" of McDonald's voice gets an added boost from my Bose Acoustimass speakers. Although I'm a 30-something -- and just a little too young to ""remember"" these tunes -- they're still fresh.The first time we played ""I Believe (When I Fall In Love),"" my wife and I started slow-dancing spontaneously in the kitchen. We haven't done that in forever, and our kids just rolled their eyes at us.So is it slick? Yeah, it's slick. And there's nothing but good feelings here. Works for me."
5,Great. Just Great.,"Michael does it again with his stunning renditions of Motown classsics that belong on ""The Big Chill"". Some remake highlights are ""I Heard it Through the Grapevine"", ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", and the best on the CD, Michael's haunting rendition of ""You are Everything"". Mcdonald was able to do that on the radio with just his voice and a piano, he may sound like he's straining on a few of the long notes, but this guy is TALENTED! Bottom Line: Are you willing to hear downbeat versions of Upbeat Motown classsics? Then this Cd is for you!"
2,"A Valiant Attempt, But Misses The Mark...","I love Motown and I am also willing to overlook that ""You Are Everything"" and ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"" are not Motown songs originally (although they were recorded by Motown artists later), but Michael McDonald tries too hard to make this work. Occasionally, it does with ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", ""Too High"", ""Singed, Sealed, Delivered."" What was he thinking on ""How Sweet It Is..??"" He took all the soul out of the song trying to give it a current (hip?) arrangement - which only reinforces how sorry the state of today's R&B; music is. If you want to hear a killer version of ""All Is Fair In Love"", try Marc Anthony's verrsion on the Steveie Wonder tribute CD ""Conception"" - although that also seems to miss the mark.If you like the songs, it might be worth investigating, as I did. However, this CD just makes me want to reach for the original versions instead......"
3,Runs ot of focus,"Michael McDonald remains true to the original Motown versions of the songs on this CD. The opening song represents one of the best known Motown songs of the sixties, which until 1981 was the label's longest running number 1 on the popular charts. There are a few other enjoyable songs, however starting with ""I Want You"", Michael begins to concentrate on lesser known and less enduring songs, which do not stay true to the concept of a Motown greatest hits package. With 3 or 4 really good songs, some like me will think it is a worthwhile buy, others may chose to go to one of the pay-per-download sites and select only what they really like."
3,"Perfunctory, workmanlike craftsmanship.","Michael McDonald was one of the great ""Blue-eyed Soul Singers"" of the seventies and early eighties. But soon after his solo album ""If That's What It Takes"" came out, his chosen style of music began to fade from the public's favor. He's been fighting an uphill battle ever since. Over 20 years later, he finally has a hit record again. I won't begrudge him the method, but will state that this album is tastefully done and generally listenable should you not be expecting more than background pleasantries. If you are feeling like Hip-hop, electroclash and techno all come from another planet, you may enjoy this. On the other hand, if the current spate of older artists racing towards the classics makes you want to string them up for heresy, then you better skip this for a copy of ""The Big Chill"" soundtrack."
5,Michael singing Marvin??????,"OK...I must admit I ONLY bought this CD so I could ""bash""Michael McDonald for ""attempting"" to carry off Marvin Gayes' ""I want you"" and ""distant lover"". Singing Motown is one thing but singing the late great Marvin Gaye is Quite another!!..BOY was I WRONG!!! Not only does Michael sings ""I want you"", but he does a DAMN good job or remaking my fav Marvin Gaye song. His version of ""distant Lover "" is also awesome. I have played this CD over and over and over again and I just cant get enough. Please buy it ..you will NOT regret. ONLY one question......I can't understand why Michael McDonald did not make PEOPLE magazines Sexiest people...He is HOT HOT HOT!!"
3,Ain't nothing like the real thing baby...,"Fourteen Motown covers including four by Stevie Wonder. Worthy of a listen or two but ""ain't nothing like the real thing baby...ain't nothing like the real thing""."
3,Canned and overproduced.,"He's got a great voice and I've always liked his work......but this sounds like more was done on a computer than a group of musicians actually playing together....and the liner notes and credits seem to indicate that as well. The percussion track, in particular, is heavy handed and obviously computerized. A musician of his talent and resources could have been a lot more ""real""."
5,Pure Excellence,"Michael Mcdonald is an artist who has not rec'd the recognition he deserves as one of the great and influential vocalists in popular music. This new CD only supports this argument even further.Although he covers songs that are almost to good to screw up, he actually adds a personal touch to this great material and makes them his own. His performance of Marvin Gaye & Stevie Wonder's work particularly stands out.I recommend this CD very highly, it's a great performance by a great singer."
3,Mostly Marvin Gaye,"I love McDonald. Always did even way back when he played with Steely Dan (prior to the Doobies). I have most of his stuff. But with all of the great Motown Music to choos from did 6 of them have to be from Marvin Gaye? All good songs but that happened to the Temptations, 4 tops, Smokey Robinson. If you love michael McDonald buy it...but don't look for a wide variety of Motown Songs."
5,McDonald/Motown,"What could be better.....? Motown sound and Michael McDonald's voice, what a combination. The first time I heard this was in a commercial and then went right out and bought it. This cd is perfect. I play it at home and in the car...can't get enough."
3,I Liked One Cut in Particular...,"This is one glossy set of covers, but I was really impressed with his take on ""I Want You"", Marvin Gaye's original. Michael McDonald dives into it with an intensity unmatched by any other cut on the recording.The album was pretty decent overall."
3,OK,"With all due respect to Michael McDonald, there isn't any song on this CD that tops the original recording. I hope we don't get ""Motown II""."
2,"Ok ,but...","Who mixed this thing?The bass mix is so bloated and overwhelming that it feels as if were mixed especially for those idiots with the $200 dollar cars and the $2000 dollar car dollar stereos.Less is more on these classics and whoever engineered and mixed this album should be buggered with a hot poker.If you want to listen to a great remake of those Motown classics ,try the soundtrack from The Commitments."
1,Mcdonald does not know Motown,"I have never been as disappointed in a CD as I am with this one. If you want Motown, get the real thing. This is not even a bad imitation. It simply bears no resemblance to Motown."
2,So Disappointed,"I am sorry but I am so disappointed in this CD. I have always been a Michael McDonald fan but this just does nothing for me. I think maybe Clay has ruined it for me. I can no longer listen to singing that I can not hear the words to. I use to like that about Michael, his voice was always so sexy, so rough. I now love to hear Clay sing and only Clay. I would recommend Clay's single over this one any day."
2,Do it right!,"If you're going to record the Motown classics, then record them like they were initially made! Why kill a classic with your own rendition? Tempo, note alterations and voice changes to the actual recording doesn't cut it Michael! Leave the classics alone Michael. It isn't in the cards for you!"
1,This CD is Garbage!!!!,"Hudson Tannis'is as much of an audiophile as I am a brain surgeon. This CD is rubbish just cashing in on the latest trend to do cover albums like Rod Stewart, Bette Midler, and all this yuppie crap. He has Toto 'Love Songs' on his list. COME ON!! Hudson Tannis needs to pick up an album by Philip Glass or Tom Waits to see if that rocks his speakers. It's not the size of the speakers Tannis it's what you play on them......"
5,kicks butt - the man sings like he's in the First AME Church,"To use an analogy from Greek mythology, anyone attempting to cover classic hits such as the Motown greats must feel somewhat like Icarus - one's wings melted by the fierce sun of criticism.Michael McDonald need not worry - this CD kicks serious butt; that smoky, sexy baritone is as great as ever, the arranging and composition smoke! He does Motown proud, and for someone with snow-white hair and beard, the man sings and plays like he's in the First AME Church, if you get my drift!"
2,ain't nothin' like the real thing,"the material covered in this album includes some of the greatest pop songs ever written, sung by a performer who is usually quite engaging. However, despite the slick production, this is an uninspired effort by michael mcdonald which lacks much of the emotion of the original songs. in addition, Mr. McDonald appears to have lost more than a few notes off the upper part of his vocal range. as a result, it is downright painful listening to him try to reach the upper registers on some of these songs. the idea behind this collection of songs is great so the poor execution is particularly disappointing."
1,A Dismal Disappointment,"I was so looking forward to hearing this CD, that is why I found it so disappointing. The vocals are contrived and the back up singing is so awful as to be amusing. The producer was trying his darndest to make this singer sound like he had a little soul. The whole thing reminds me of when they tried to ""whiten up"" Ray Charles in the 50's/60's with back-up singers and strings, only in the reverse. If you really want to enjoy this genre of music, buy a Marvin Gaye CD cause ""A'int nothin' like the real thing, baby""."
3,"Not bad, but not even",I've loved MM since he was a Doobie. Assumed I would enjoy this CD and do. But some of his charts are more Van Morrison than Motown and that hurts the overall success of the effort.
1,Ugh!!!!!!!,"This is by far the worst album I have ever heard--period!!!! If you want real Motown classics...then GET THE ""REAL THING"", BABY!!! Leave this album alone, unless you're buying it for a friend, you might just need some earplugs. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!!!"
3,not all bad,"albeit no new material, but most of these are great songs, and i really enjoyed michael's rendition of several. i wonder if reviewer tim from indiana really listened to this cd before writing his glowing review, as one of the few songs he references is ""hey girl"" which mcdonald did in fact cover years ago but it sure isn't on this cd. maybe tim was testing us?"
2,"Serious fans, stay away","Waste of Michael Mcdonald. The arrangements are so uninspired, it might as well be Michael Bolton."
3,Rip 0ff,"The advertising on tv showed the only cut that was worth listening to. Based on that cut I bought the CD, only to find out that all the other cuts were pretty mediocre. That's why I call this a rip off, or, if you prefer, a case of false advertising."
5,motown,"Once again the ex-doobie gives it his best.this cd is outstanding (you are everything brought tears to my eyes,too bad the press isnt giving this cd the credit it deserves.great job mike."
5,Fantastic!!,"I am a Mc Donald fan of many years. This album is a treat for a Jazz afficianado like myself. Accompanying Michael on ""Motown"" are the musicians of the Jazz supergroup, Fourplay, which makes for a great listen. The songs suit Mc Donald's smoky blue-eyed soul to a ""T"", especially ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine""."
1,WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES....,"The wise man has the power...to not buy this. Oh, yes, I'll be 0-for-30 on the votes soon - but COME ON. Motown also shares blame for this disaster, as now NO mountain is high enough to keep ""Coors"" or ""MCI"" or whomever chooses to soil Marvin and Tammi's...or Ashford and Simpson's...or even my memories, from doing so. Having had to sit and listen to this in a car in which I was a passenger, I can now say that Michael holds a place in my heart along with Kenny G, Rod Stewart, and Astrud. The MCI commercial alone should be a warning signal for anyone who values 'the real deal' - unlike those named above who have assassinated and degraded an entire genre of great music. Allright...have at me."
2,Disappointed,"I admire Michael MacDonald as a composer as a singer and as a performer... unfortunately he did not pay any attention to the musical arrangements on this record. It feels as he only sings the songs. Just listen to ""All in Love is Fair""; most of his renderings are plain and simple, none of the songs were enriched."
3,"Good product, late arrival!","I love this CD set through and through, but I strongly urge you buy through a vendor other than Amazons own warehouse. Granted it may have been a sold out before updating the website, but I ended up waiting over a month and received a polite e-mail (and nothing else) apologizing for the delay and re-updating the delivery date/arrival. Once again, I would choose a independent vendor through Amazon rather than Amazon itself. At least until further convincing from Amazon that they can ship faster, update more frequently online the availability, and offer more than an apology and changing delivery dates, I stand by my review."
3,Friends rave about it.,"So I got it thinking it would help my neck also. (Have severe degeneration) Didn't help me, in fact, gave me a heck of a headache. Gave it to a friend and she loves it! I'd recomenned people to try it but I think it's really trial and error."
2,not for me,"This pillow is not for me. It may help some people, just not me. It is not comfortable under my neck."
5,The absolute best Todd Lammle book to date!,"I really can say that I have nearly all of Todd Lammle's books, Based upon that, I think I am well founded to say that this latest tome is, by far, the most enjoyable, fluid updated book in both my experience and my possession. Good show! This volume is absolutely first class, and comes highly recommended.Internetworking, wireless, RIP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IP routing, etc. is covered in depth and in an easy to understand manner as usual for a Sybex Cisco book."
3,Not impressed.,"After having thoroughly read this book cover to cover, I cannot understand how it can be so highly recommended. To be a fourth edition, there were far too many errors, especially in the written exercises. The author has a habit of not explaining some topics in detail, and his writing style leaves a lot to be desired. At many points in the book, I ran across passages that were completely vague and other parts that contradicted previous information. Initially, I was planning on reading this book twice, but I am now moving on to Cisco Press.I do not recommend this book. ..."
1,CCNA,"Well i dont mean to say bad things about this book, but i failed my CCNA. 5 of my 57 questions referance certain topics that this book doesnt cover very well.So basicly if you have no experience with Cisco Equipment then i would suggest going with CCNA Self-Study: CCNA Preparation Library (640-801), 6th Edition By Steve McQuerry. ISBN: 1587051842 or some other cisco book.The reason i say this is because i checked out this book in a local store and found the answers to the 5 questions i got wrong and it seem like this Cisco book goes in more depth."
4,Great CCNA Study Book,"A great book for the aspiring CCNA. This is the #1 CCNA book on the market today. Grab the latest edition for the most up-to-date test coverage.The only thing that would have made this book better, would have been error correction. Be sure to check Sybex's website for all the errata corrections."
2,You won't definitely pass just reading this book,"I saw so many stars about this book but I'm just wondering that is this book that worthy?How could people give this book five stars??Unbelievable!!I took this exam few weeks ago and failed.This book doesn't cover many things.It skipped about NAT and PAT.I don't know how the writer could do it not even mentioning those in his book. OSPF is really important for this exam but the writer did not give detail information about DR,BDR and so many other things.When I took this exam,I realized that I should have read some other books.I've some good advice for newbies.You should also read Wendell Odom's CCNA ICND Exam certification book(Cisco press).I'm not intending to advertise Cisco's Book.Just wanna tell that Todd Lammle's book is really not enough for passing CCNA exam except you're a highly skilled,expert in network."
2,Loaded with typos and technical inaccuracies,Sybex's website already has a long list of typos and technical inaccuracies for this book (and this particular edition.) It's apparent to me that they have still managed to miss many more mistakes. I'm only on Chapter 4 and I've been so dismayed by the quality of this book that I had to write this warning immediately.
4,Clear CCNA the easy way...,"Todd Lammle has done a good job in covering almost all of CCNA material, in an easy way. Any prospective CCNA taker, must readthis book from cover-to-cover to pass the CCNA exam. More importantly, working out the exercises at the end of each chapter is absolutely essential.As a reader indicated, portions on NAT & RIPV2 needs to be included and covered in depth in the next revision of this handy CCNA Guide.If you want to clear the CCNA Exam in a short time, 'Use' this book and more importantly 'Use' it 'Fully'.Gave a 4 star, to account for missing portions in the book..."
2,not that good,"Unless you already know the stuff, this book wont help out much. If you already do know the basics, there are better ways to prepare for the CCNA."
2,4th edition doesn't cut it,"I ordered the 4th edition, because it was cheaper. I've never seen the 5th edition though. In the 4th edition, they spend too much time talking about 1900 series routers, Pre IOS Version 12 and Pre Y2K stuff. When I studied for the CCNA exam, this book was only 10% useful. It's an OK reference book if you don't have anything else though."
2,Missing information,"While this book is fairly well written, it fails to cover several topics, such as NAT, PAT, PAR and RIPv2. The author even goes sofar as to say that RIPv2 is not covered on the exam, but I had at least 5 questions pertaining to it. Sorry Lammle, but I'll be going with Wendell Odom from now on."
2,Missing,"I used this book to prepare for the CCNA, I felt it was inadequate. I did well on the test in areas the book covered the otherside is I did poorly in areas the book missed like NAT, Ospf etc."
2,It's an okay CD but not her best effort!,"Brazilian jazz pianist Eliane Elias sings several of Antonio Carlos Jobim's classics on this CD. It logically is a sequel to a 1990 release, ""Eliane Elias Plays Jobim."" Eliane's singing in PORTUGUESE [not Spanish, as stated by another customer reviewer] is weak at times. Her attempt at a sound similar to Chet Baker's is thin and too low in volume. Her singing is best when she sings and plays piano with no accompaniment. Better CDs are the 1990 release and ""Paulistana."""
2,no all that thrilling,I found her voice to be almost inaudible.Overwhelmed by her excellent piano work.To be frank I am disappointed inthe disc.
5,An Outstanding Achievement,"Everyone who has ever heard me playing this album immediately buys it. It's pure therapy for the heart and soul. Pat is one of most accomplished songwriters of our time who's been (thankfully) passed over by the masses (except for those dark glasses). Way too smart to ever be a pop album, 'Sleeps' is a diamond in a sea of '90s musical mud. Treat yourself and the company you keep to a CD that you are not likely to put away for a long time...Buy it."
3,Really?,When I first got this product I was very excited. It arrived quickly and looked great. Then I looked at the instructions and realized that they were incomplete(there were references to illustrations that were not there). When I attempted to put it on my bike it was like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. The U bolts did not match up with the hole and they were not long enough. I'm sure if I can find some bolts to fit the bar then it will work great but I hate spending money to make something I already bought work.Update: Got the bars to work kind of. They now are on the bike and serve their purpose. They are comfortable and would have got a five stars had I not had so much trouble initially.
4,True to original version and satisfying (with cautions).,"My 9-year-old niece is an avid Nancy Drew fan and enjoyed this entry in the series so I bow to her opinion. Here are a few comments from my reading:- This edition is faithful to the original story from the Forties (clearly stated up front) and contains a few racial references and stereotypes that make one cringe nowadays.- The plot seems a bit intricate and complicated for young readers.- If you're sensitive to violence, be aware that there is a shooting involved (but I suppose that's true in many of these mysteries).Other than that, my niece and I both found the book satisfying, and I imagine it's typical of the early Nancy Drew entries."
3,The M ystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion Review-----DEM_15,I think this book was a very good mystery. I would recommend this book to litte children who like adventure's and mysteries. The scenes in this book is great it takes place in an Orange Grove in Florida. the mystery is about some kind of exploding oranges. This book is the eighteenth book that Carolyn Keene has written. Now she has over a million books written today. I especially recommend these books to young women that love mysteries.Doris Mendes
5,Nancy Drew 18: Mystery of the Moss-Covered Mansion,I haven't finished this book yet. Although I know it is going to be good. My name is Sally and I'm in 4th grade. So far I've read 18 Nancy Drew books and they've all been good. I wish there was an endless number of Nancy Drew books.
2,Nancy Drew Book #18,I bought this book for my niece for her B-Day! She loves Nancy Drew books!! She said this book was pretty good but not as good as some of the other ones she has read. She still enjoyed it none the less!
2,The Bare Essentials,"If you are a collector of the absolute essentials, this disc is for you. Instead of rehashing already featured tracks available on the excellent twenty track ""Magic"" set released late last year, the approach on this set should have featured songs from Olivia's long out-of-print first Greatest Hits package and tracks from her later recordings with MCA such as ""Soul Kiss"" and ""The Rumor."" It would have made this disc a little more collectable. If the earlier comps are in your collection, skip this disc."
3,How-to versus ideas for inspiration,"The book is well written, the photos are fine. I did not expect the step by step, cookie-cutter directions that this book is. I wanted a more general approach to making ANY box on the bandsaw. For example, since she incorporates the cuts through the frame of the box to make the drawers into her design (and I want to minimize and conceal those cuts) I found no good info on how best to hide those cuts. Her boxes are beautiful, and if all you want to do is duplicate those specific boxes, this book is for you."
1,Not sure what the hype is....,I bought and returned this book on the same day. My only regret is I should have gone to look at it at the store first. I found it outdated and not useful (for me anyway). All the patterns were a variation of the cover photo - nothing more.Please do yourself a favor and go look at it before you buy and have to pay to mail it back!Only one start because you can't give zero....
3,Good Information - One dimensional,"The contents of the book are very good, but the designs are all of one type... just variations on a theme. It would have been good to have other ideas for designs."
4,Easter fun,"This is a fun book for parents and young children to share together. As the little girl and her puppy, Biscuit, hunt for Easter eggs, children will want to join in by lifting the flaps to discover where the colorful eggs are hidden. A little mouse joins the girl and her puppy on each page and some children will have as much fun looking for the mouse as they do looking for the eggs."
3,goathead,"Purchased some of these to handle goatheads in Albuquerque. Both of my tires were filled after a 26 miler, mostly on pavement. No obvious leaks during the event, but one of the tires felt soft when I got home. I pulled two conspicuous goatheads out, that were situated dead center. I heard substantial hissing and the tire fully deflated.Tuffys are nice -> clearly my tires would have succumbed earlier without them. But they aren't full proof, as two goatheads penetrated straight thru. Tubeless with a sealant is the way to go I'm told. Stans No Tubes has $60 conversion kits, which is quite reasonable."
4,Best tire liners of all time. Mr. Tuffy!,"I live in the southwest US. Where the most dangerous thorns are.. The Mighty Goat Head! haha[...]Thats what they look like and they kill tubes and tires. I put this in my road bike tire after 4 flats in one week on the trails and i have not had one flat yet. These tire liners are great. In my mountain bike i paired this with a slime tube for extreme flat resistance but even in my road bike i have no flats, they are great!"
4,Difficult to do a good installation,"It is not an easy task to insert it and keep it centered in the tire.I have the orange model with a 700 x 23 tire.You insert it first in the tire then you put the tube in. This displace Mr Tuffy and with a 700 x 23 tire there is no room for one finger to recenter Mr Tuffy. It would be a good idea if Mr Tuffy had glue on one side to keep it centered on the tire. I read some review that Mr Tuffy pinch the tube, It can not if it is centered. I suspect that Mr Tuffy moved sideway during the installation."
3,edges definitely cause flats,"I have been using 'Mr. Tuffy' for many years. Yes, they do help prevent some penetration type flats but they also have their issues. The area of overlap leaves one exposed edge that eventually will wear into your tube and cause a flat. There is no doubt about this and the outline of the exposed edge is clearly visible on the tube where the flat is. You can prevent this by placing a square piece of rubber from one of the tubes that Mr. Tuffy ruined over the area of overlap to protect the new tube from the exposed edge of the liner. Trust me, this works. One of the things I like about the tire liners is the extra rotating weight they add to your bike. It's great for training and when you remove the tire liners before a long ride or tour the bike feels much lighter. It's like training weights for your bike!"
3,plastic,"nothing but a plastic strip, I took a staple gun shot a staple in an old gaterskin tire, went right in. Put the liners in, same thing, went right in. you tell me"
2,"Awesome Power, Tiny Package","It would take a hammer to get a nail through these things. However, if you run them in a 2 inch wide Mtn bike tire you are wishful thinkin'.Might as well buy a bullet proof neck tie and hope for the best.They are made for the 1.5"" tire on a bike that doesn't lean too far on the sidewall."
5,It helps with flats,"After a few weeks no flats, I don't feel any difference since they were installed. I can't say how difficult is to install since a dealer did it for me. I am using these strips together with thorn resistance tubes hoping to eliminate flats, I'll be looking also into Armadillo Specialized tires that are suppose to be also flat resistance."
4,"Does the job, but...","I do adventure racing and train in the wilderness quite often. In Florida, you get a lot of trails with sugar sand, and when you ride on the sides of the trails to avoid them, there are usually thorny plants. It's a lose/lose situation. There was a period where I would average at least one flat tire after a training session or race event. Then I tried these tire liners. They added weight to my wheels, but it wasn't significant, since most of my riding was off-road, where the terrain was the number one factor in slowing you down. It probably cut down my flat tires by half. I still had them because the thorns were still able to get to the areas that were not covered by these liners. These liners aren't very wide to cover a tire that is rated to be 2.35"". They do the job, no doubt, but it still was not the solution to all flats. I'm currently trying a set of kevlar tires, which have been holding up without a flat so far (crosses fingers)."
2,very difficult to read,"print on side panels of each page are very hard to read. very small and light print , very thin font,, on colored paper.was looking forward to this book but can't read part of it."
2,"Pros, Cons (Updated)","Pros: Bright, clear, white LED light in a compact, durable package with a very long bulb life.Cons: Eats (rather expensive) batteries like popcorn.Suggested - practically mandatory - companion product.Update: I've reduced the rating to 2 stars after purchasing aNu-Flare Ultrabright 76R91to replace my second of the Dorcy flashlights, which broke due to rolling off counters in spite of the grooved head that should prevent that. The difference in battery life (on the same batteries, with a higher light output!) is *amazing*. I had no idea what I was missing relying on these for so long."
4,Gun-Fu and Mafia intrigue,"With the exception of the pilot episode, Gungrave is primarily flashbacks of the main characters life. The first two DVDs have really in-depth story lines, but not as much action compared to the first episode. The third collection is probably the best so far for the series since it really picks up on Brandon's shooting techniques and introduces the infamous necrolization project that eventually turns Brandon into Beyond the Grave. It still has the intrigue in Millenion with a traitor in the organization and Harry's ambitions realized. Look for Fangoram(or at least one who looks like him) from Gungrave: Overdose on the episode called ""Kind."""
4,A pretty good anime,"Gungrave is a good story about a couple of friends that move up from being street punks to the leaders of a powerful mafia organization. Brandon, the main character is murdered by his partner, Harry, and returns from the grave to take revenge and set things right again. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell. There a lot of really awesome characters and fight scenes in this anime. There is also enough drama and character development to keep you wanting more.The animation and voice acting are pretty good. You should recognize many of these voice actors. Overall this is a really good anime. Especially for one based on a video game. I recommend it to any anime fan."
4,Quite a few chuckles,"No doubt some will dub this as a ""dirty comic book"", but I enjoyed several chuckles with this one. True, it's a bit chauvanistic, maybe juvenile, but sex CAN be funny. Some of the artwork was good, bordering on caricature, while some was rather lame. This is the kind of book that provides some ""guilty laughs""As an artist, I appreciate most forms of drawing. Even if you are a prude, you might find yourself snickering at some of the gags."
2,Poor quality?,"I spend a great deal of time on the phone using Skype, so at first I was really excited to actually have a handset, however, gradually we were starting to have problems with this phone.After 2-3 months we had occasional problems where there would be noise on the line or we couldn't hear the other person. It kept getting worse, and now, 6 months after we bought the phone it's completely dead. This is a huge disappointment, since I use a Mac, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of Skype phones available for Macs."
3,It's ok but I don't think i'd buy another one,"My main complaint with this handset is that the drivers are a bit buggy. Sometimes if it gets disconnected, you have to restart everything to get it to work. Lately it's been having trouble connecting to skype, so it doesn't ring even though the rest of the features work.The other complaint about this phone is that the square edges are not comfortable when held against your ear for long periods of time.I haven't tried other skype handsets but I think I will look elsewhere when i purchase my next one"
2,"Great, when it works","I like this phone way better than any headset, but it hasn't held up to much use at all. First it just wouldn't work - when I opened it up I saw that the ground shielding wire in the cable was totally frayed and seemed to be grounding out inside the phone. This was not a case of abuse or wear - just bad assembly. 2 months later, I'm not sure what's wrong with it but people on the other end hear a lot of noise from my side and it's taken to causing my macbook to crash. It's a shame because there doesn't seem to be another cheap, simple usb phone that works on the Mac. I might end up buying the same phone again. :("
4,Great phone for Skype,"The sound quality is good, better than my analog headphone / mike combo. Being a USB connected device it bypasses the sound card thus not picking up noise from the computer. As a hand held phone format it is pretty good. Too thin to hold between your head and shoulder like a real phone. So, if you are on a longer call it can get tiring having to hold this phone. Having one hand tied up when your in front of the computer can be a handicap too. Otherwise I like it. One thing... Even though Skype recognized that I had this device and asked if it was allowed to interact with Skype, I still had to go into skypes settings and enable / allow it again before the buttons etc worked."
5,Reggae Reborn,"This album is superb. The Rasites blend roots reggae with a little r'n'b and hip-hop to create a unique sound in today's musical climate. The fact that the band are still young (the oldest member is only 20) is something to be admired, along with their messages of freedom and equality : these guys mean what they say. Hopefully the band will tour soon. They show a lot of potential and could kick start a whole new wave of reggae."
4,Excellent Choice,"I would recommend this product to anyone needing a personal GPS. It is compact & easy to carry. The rubber on the sides make it a secure grip. One draw back is short battery life if you have the ""backlight"" on for very long.But overall a very easy & enjoyable unit to use."
5,Love This GPS!!,We have had the 60CS for over one month. We love it!!! It's highly durable and configurable.
4,my observations,"Basically the unit is very good indead. It is well made, easy to read and performs its functions well. HOWEVER, my unit was defective in that the altimeter/barometer proved not to give correct readings when being adjusted to a known source. I have sent it back to Garmin for repair. While this won't cost me anything other than shipping cost to the manufacturer, Garmin has told me that they could very well ship me back a used unit in place of my brand new one. I am not pleased with that aspect of Garmin's merchandising."
5,Garmin 60CS GPS,"I used this unit in Colorado while hiking in dense forest and had excellent results. It was intuitive, updated quickly and accurately and all the information I needed was clearly presented. The altimeter (a function I did not think I would use) was as it turned out very useful. I looked online for nearly a month before deciding to go with this unit and I am not disappointed. The only negative I've identified is that the GPS uses appx 2 AA batteries a day. I've heard that older units are even worse so I just planned for that"
1,Doesn't work with a Macintosh,"For years, Garmin has refused to produce mapping software that works with a Mac, or open up their protocols to other companies that do. Alternatives such as Virtual PC are cumbersome and add unnecessary expense to an already overpriced device."
4,Great speakers for the price,"I was looking for a nice set of speakers for the home office for a few months. I came across these online and they happened to be on sale. I decided to give them a go and see if they would work out. They do, and then some!If you're in small appartment or dorm, maybe not the best, as the bass is extreme! It creates a nice shake in my home office, enough that my wife hears from across the house.Only problem I have with this set is the short wires. Would like to also have a cordless volume controler, but speakers are worth it even with these small flaws.Just buy em."
2,Blatant Mormon Bashing,"This book begins well but quickly unravels. As a Catholic, I was very disappointed with the unwarranted and unnecessary attacks on other faiths. I also found the militant tone of the book disturbing. At many points, the dialogue and behavior of the key female characters was unbelievable. If this book brings readers closer to Mary, it will be for all the wrong reasons."
1,Doesn't cut it,"I'm sorry, but I found this book to be extremely predictable, with no real surprises. Within the first 75 pages or so, I had already predicted with 90% accuracy what would happen. The characters weren't well developed, there were no unexpected twists to the plot, and overall it seemed too contrived. The best fiction, in my opinion, is one that has an air of beliveablity or a hint of possibility to it...this book had none."
1,Terrible,"What a ridiculous book - if you want to read a book that flatters your belief system, go ahead and pick this one up. But if you want a book that has anything to do with life as it's lived by real, living breathing human beings,try something else. Stock characters, no ambiguity, no real character growth."
2,Not worth reading.,The book was easy to read. The first few chapters were great; but the book went downhill from there. Hopefully the author has better books ahead of him.
4,Cool book!,"I, for one, liked this book. It was a real page turner. True, it is not a great work of literature, but it is definately worth reading. The thing that I liked is that the heroes are all orthadox Catholic, not wishy-washy middle-of-road Catholics. For those reading this, get this book, especially if you like exciting action novels."
2,Catholic lite,"I appreciated this book's willingness to be Catholic, and its reverence. However, as noted elsewhere, the dialogue is painfully wooden at times. This is like a dime store knock off of Walker Percy's novels. I would recommend them over this book. Further, the theology of grace and ""merit"" offered here reminds me of my suspicion of scholasticism and its break with patristic tradition. Also troubling was the God and Marines identification, with ""Semper Fi"" being bandied about. Are Catholics and Marines ""always faithful"" to the same things?Again, it is refreshing to read a so blatantly Catholic novel, however it is not necessarily the most rich experession of Catholic faith available."
1,Forget it,"The books are of little literary merit, and worst of all, the author promotes them as 'traditional Catholicism,' but he has acted scandalously in leaving his Catholic marriage and four kids and remarrying, and absolutely torturing his long-suffering wife. The more quickly Bud McFarlane is forgotten, the better. Don't buy and don't promote."
1,Thought it was too arogant and militant,"First I like to say that I think Mr. McFarland is a very talented writer, and has a passion for what he does. However, I think that his attitude of its my way or the highway belief oozes off the pages. Also, I agree with another reviewer on this board that he paints a very bad picture of people who have differing beliefs than him. One part in the book that bothered me was the part describing the horrible plague that swept parts of the Globe, and how only baptized and ""practicing christians"" were spared. Another thing that bothered me is that even though catholics do not agree what the mormom church teaches theologically, I do not think Mr. Mcfarland had to portray them as some kind of evil cult (it hurt me especially because i know a lot wonderful people who are mormoms). I know as a catholic myself I do not apreciate when people call our church a cult."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I received this book as a Christmas present, and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! The story really drew me in, and I stayed interested in what would happen next. It was a great read, especially considering that it's the author's first book.I just ordered his 3rd book from the publisher (starting on the 2nd today since that was also part of my Christmas gift), and I can't wait to see how those stories unfold!"
5,"A life-changing, faith-enhancing wonderful book!","I usually prefer non-fiction, but this wonderful book had me ""going"" from page 1. I wanted to leave it for someone else to find and read, but couldn't part with my copy. Wonderful characters, fast-paced and thought-provoking. You'll lose yourself in Nathan's not-too-fictional world!"
3,They're Both Right,"Both those who loved this book and those who hated it are right.This book is not Dante, it is not Dostoevsky, it is not Dickens, it is not even John Grisham on a bad day. I'm guessing that the writing is probably on a level with a lot of the trashy novels that you see around the airport (though I have to confess that I've never read any of them--one novel by Grisham or Mitchener every decade or so is about as much time as I can stand to waste).That being said, a lot of people LOVED this book. I read it when a fellow Catholic pressed it into my hands and told me that it was the best novel she had ever read and that I HAD to read it. Even though I winced at some of the writing, I did find the book to be a page turner, and it was exhilarating for me, and I'm sure for many others, to read an action adventure story that is based on an overtly Catholic view of both the spiritual and material realms."
5,Incredible!,"This book made me laugh, cry, and pray! It has everything! Full of action, suspence, and romance! Very compelling. Everyone can identify with one of the characters-or you know someone else who can. This book has something for everyone. A must read!"
5,Michelle Tumes.. Not quite my style.,"I bought this album because I had read great reviews on her music. However, I did not personally like her style of singing. It is very hard to actually hear the words of her songs and the background music is very repetitive. I know that this will not be a popular review.. but it is an honest one.Although I am in my sixties I have a huge variety of female vocalists which include Twila Paris, Kathy Troccoli, Susan Ashton, Margaret Becker, Sandi Patty and Point of Grace, just to mention a few. So I have a really varied taste in music. My taste in male singers is even more varied... from the lovely ballads of Michael Card and Dallas Holms, to Charlie Peacock, Steven Curtis Chapman, Ray Boltz, and many more. So I do not feel that I am being unfair to Michelle in writing this review.Perhaps, if I got one of her later albums, I might have a totally different view of it."
4,Uplifting,"I first heard a demo of Ms. Tumes two years ago and knew she was destined to be a hit. I was delighted to hear her on the radio today for the first time! My favorite is ""Life is Beautiful"", a wonderful tune. I can't wait to enjoy this CD again!"
5,Michelle Tumes is simply great!,"Pop in the CD and ""Listen"" carefully to the melodious voice of Michelle Tumes.... This album' got it all! The enchanting vocals of this Australian-born singer/songwriter will transport you to a place where you will want to stay for a long time. From the title track to songs like ""Feel"" , ""My constant One"" and ""Please come back to me"", Michelle reveals the spirit of a young woman well on her way to being a terrific and insightful songwriter. She openly, yet naturally and comfortably, expresses her faith and views of her day-to day happenings. The wonderful lyrics are supported by an artistically superb music arrangement that combines piano, Celtic influences and strings. But beyond all this, just kick back and listen ......"
5,A very pleasing album.,The overall flow of the album is smooth and soothing. It demonstrates her talents beautifully.
5,Touching,"I heard Healing Waters for about 2 weeks, then it wasn't played anymore. I miss listening to it and the words to the song reach into my heart and stir me. I wish I had the words. I have sat in the car listening to it and my husband comes out to hear what I'm listening to.My whole life, I have always said ""Amazing Grace is my favorite song"", Healing Waters took my vote.Not only is God amazing, but he heals with his pure love of healing. Thank you for a beautiful song.Melissamelcm@apex2000.net"
5,My review is based on the sound of the music,"Michelle Tumes has a gift that few people have. That is one of the reasons I feel obliged to buy her CD ""Listen"". It describes inner feelings, and tells you about God and His realtionship with you. I entreat all who listen to this CD to relax and enjoy the melodies and harmonies of the pieces it contains. You will feel closer to God and to your inner self after you have ""listen""-ed."
5,A MUST HAVE if you LOVE GOOD MUSIC,A fabulous music experience from start to finish!! John's genuine talent and spirit shine through in every song-taking you from one emotion to the next and back again! It truly is a MUST HAVE for any music enthusiast. Don't wait until this artist is 'discovered' to discover him for yourself!
1,NOT a beginner book,"This is more of an intermediate book and not well written at that. The most horribly written section (if I had to choose one) is on sports signs. The instructions claim that ""Each sign clearly demonstrates its sport."" To whom I have no idea. Maybe a few of the signs were obvious but the rest were extremely confusing. My husband, who is a genius, could not figure some of them out.If you have an older child who is learning SEE this might be an ok book but if you are truly working with a beginner, this will only frustrate you."
4,Good book,This book is pretty well written and really help you understand the materials better. This book is pretty well organized and very easy to follow
3,a very good disc,"Found this walking in the record store the other day. Got home and put it on. I've liked Concrete Blonde music for many years. I heard that this disc was mostly spanish sounding and not the real CB. The first song ""Caminando"" was an excellent rock song. Johnette sings ""Viva La Vida"" also another good song. There are some low points, but overall this is a real good cd. The last song on the disc is ""Deportee"" the old Woody Guthrie song which i first heard done by The Byrds many years ago, this version is very good also."
2,disappointed a die-hard fan,"Being an avid Concrete Blonde fan & also a fan of good Hispanic music, I naturally assumed that this would be a can't miss cd. I was dead wrong. It appears that Johnette & co. were finished after Mexican Moon. This thing falls flat on its face! It sounded absolutely uninspired. If you need a Concrete Blonde fix, but own all the other stuff, you'd do much better to pick up Pretty & Twisted(A Johnette project that is very worthwhile). I tried this one out for a while, but could never get into it. I ended up givimg it away. Johnette is too talented to give up on, but who among us is perfect? I don't know if she's lost the passion or if it just took a holiday on this one. I strongly suspect the latteer. It's not just the vocals; the music is flat too. Another Hundred Years Of Solitude is easily the best track on an otherwise lackluster album.update: The fire is still burning. I saw CB in April of '02 and they were absolutely phenominal!!!!"
2,Concrete Blonde goes Spanish?,I am highly disappointed in this album and the efforts of Johnette Napolatino and her band. This album is basically made for the Spanish speaking fans of Concrete Blonde.
1,Wrong part,When you select 2004 330CI BMW this is the part that comes up. They are 300mm in diameter. My 2004 330 CI has 330mm rotors. You can confirm the rotor size with the wheel still on the car. Though it was inconvenient the Amazon return process was as easy as could be.
2,Disappointed,"These American Girls dolls looked so cute on the computer and in the catalogs. I have to say I'm a bit diappointed with 2 things! First the hair is a wig, and with certain styling it is very obvious, most high quality dolls have rooted hair. Second the legs do not allow doll to sit easily. I didn't think it was worth high $ Save your $$$$$!!!!"
5,SCORE!,"So pleased and thrilled to have received this clock! Expensive, yes, however, not as much as I had orginally seen by a seperate company, and so glad I took the time to look it up!Vintage and quiet!! My son and husband BOTH were even impressed, again, SCORE!"
5,Great clock!!!,Bought this more than a year ago. Clock is great and quality is excellent. Package was quite big which gives good protection when transporting the clock especially as i bought this as a gift to my relatives abroad. Had to carry it with me all around the airport.
2,Romance--soap opera style.,"When Elizabeth suffers a near-fatal motorcycle accident, she gets (gasp!) amnesia! Suddenly, her entire personality changes and her old friends and family won't stand for it! Jessica is worried sick about her twin. Liz's new flirty attitude is getting on Jess' nerves and Jess vows to get back the old Liz! This is a very silly book for a very silly mood"
4,IT WAS A GREAT BOOK!,"I LOVED IT!! ITS A GREAT BOOK AND YOU HAVE TO READ IT IT`S THE FIRST TIME THAT JESSICA IS SO WORRIED ABOUT HER SISTERS LIFE, BECAUSE SHE MAY DIE!! AND TOD IS VERRY WORRIED TOO IT`S A EMAZING STORY! READ IT."
4,Great !*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!,"Todd, and the wakefields are excited to know that Elizabeth is ok. But, theres something different about her personality. Shes seems more like... Jessica. Will the tables turn and the twins personality's switch forever or is this temporary? Read the book to find out! its great but not one of my personal favorites."
3,A so-so book,"This book is one of the first in the series and that would explain the plot. It is sort of unbelievable. This is a series that gets better as the books come. I thought the book could have been better in some parts, but, all in all, it was okay."
5,instrumental versions of nearly every song from ST1! WOW!,"I waited for nearly 10 months before Amazon got this book in stock. It was definitely worth the wait! It contains sheet music for all of the songs from Sakura Taisen 1 except Hanasaku Otome (which is, for some reason, only in the Sakura Taisen 2 sheet music book) and Ai Yueni. A friend of mine, who is far superior in piano skill than I, played some of the music for me. It sounds soooooo good... the arrangements are excellent. The only problem with the book is that it doesn't include the lyrics for the songs that have them, but you can find the lyrics on the Web."
1,We waited since the 90's for this?,"Remember in the 90's when a whole bunch of T.V. movie versions of Danielle Steel's books hit the airwaves? How great most of them were, filled with passion, suspense, drama and glitz? Well, after watching this first adaption in ten years, I sure felt nostalgic for THOSE days! Melissa Gilbert, looking like she has had way too much plastic surgery, tries to act and sound (not even close) like a Frenchwoman mourning the loss of her husband and son. All she has left is an annoying daughter named ""Pip"" (no comment) and a dog called Mousse (double no comment). Well, she ends up meeting a bland guy (Brad Johnson) and they fall in love, against all odds. End of story. Really, because the acting, good pacing, spark and emotion are all non-existent. Plot devices thrown in for no good reason. Zero chemistry between any of the actors. And the intro by Danielle Steel was really odd. A huge disappointment, obviously slapped together in about 5 minutes. BRING BACK THE 90's!"
1,"Save your money, this is a waste of time & effort","I like Melissa Gilbert, but who in their right mind had her do a French accent in this movie, which does not have a bad storyline (typical Danielle Steele, though, someone has died........) but this movie is a waste of time and not at all worth the money. I will be selling mine or giving it to someone who wants to watch a dull romance story. Melissa is such a great actress, Michael Landon would be a bit nauseated watching this, after all the wonderful coaching he did when Little House was in production. What a shame, this could have been a better movie with a little effort, but falls so short. I would recommend Danielle's PALOMINO or THE PROMISE , both great novels and pretty good romance movies. Oh, that Lee Horsley, can he play a cowboy! (Palomino). Check it out for yourself!!!"
1,What were they thinking?,"Wow, this was the first time I've seen one of the Danielle Steel movies. What a complete waste of my time. Melissa Gilbert has really overdone the plastic surgery. It was uncomfortable just looking at her, but even more painful listening to her. She delivered such an amateur French accent...atrocious! The leading man was boring and not particularly appealing. His badly dyed hair was rather distracting as well. Nuf said"
1,Waste of time,"The accent was sooo terrible, and Melissa looked so unlovable that I say skip the movie and read more. MG must have needed the money. Horrible vehicle for her."
3,Safe Harbour,"I read my first DS novel only 2 weeks ago and it was Safe Harbour. What an amazing novel, I fell in love with Pip! I was so excited to see it was on DVD, but not impressed at it over all. There was so much left out and if you havent read the book you would have no clue what was going on, the transitions weren't smooth in the story like the book. Books are usually better than movies but I think this could have been better with a few minor changes and a few details added."
1,ANONYMOUS,"THIS WAS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.MELISSA GILBERT'S FRENCH ACCENT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER.THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS SO BORING.I LOST INTEREST IN IT 5 MINUTES INTO IT,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVEN REMOTELY THINKING OF BUYING THIS REALLY BAD MOVIE."
5,The best computer chess game for kids,We bought it 1 month ago to help my almost 6 year's old sun to learn how to play because I didn't know how to play and I couldn't teach him. As a result of this purchase1) My sun fall in love with chess and become so good player that I couldn't imagine2) I (his mom) learned how to play too.It is so much fun to learn it that I would recommend it to anybody. It worth it every penny I spent. I like everything about this game. Kids will love it 100%.
1,Disappointing chess product,"I was extremely disappointed with this chess software. With my newest PC I bought this year, the program is buggy when it comes to sound and music, which they do acknowledge in their manual.The product also lacks knowledge of what keeps a child's interest. For an adult or child, the dialog and some exercises were lengthy, and uninteresting.There were a couple of fun exercises, but really not worth the price as a whole.If your a chess player, I suggest you teach your kid yourself, orfind another chess program.There's got to be something better than this."
4,Great introduction for Kids,"We purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months. While I have been able to get them started, I find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow.Both kids enjoy using this software and, if I would let them, would spend hours at a time using the software.My biggest issue with the software is the sound and animation. We continually have issues with the sound/animation not being in sync or the audio cutting in and out. We run this on a computer with plenty of processing power, memory, disk space, etc. It does not bother this kids too much, but I find it annoying.All in all, a great tool to help my children learn the game."
1,Unable to use,"I purchased two of your video games through Amazon.com for Christmas presents and recently tried using them. I am very disappointed in their performance!""Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster #1"" stops soon after the King's son is challenged to a duel by Black Knight. The last phrase that can be heard is: ""Is something going to happen here before we all fall asleep?""""Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster #2"" doesn't get beyond signing in. It keeps saying, no matter name I write in, ""You're not the first to bear this name, please choose another name...""I tried removing the programs and re-installing them again and I even tried using a different laptop.What is the problem and how can it be resolved?"
1,Don't buy this sexist game,"The game is called Fritz and Chesster. Fritz is the boy. Chester is a rat. That girl you see in the picture, her name is Bianca. She never actually plays. She just says things like ""Well done, brave knight!"" and asks stupid questions. At one point poor Bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece, and Fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father. The tone and context are extremely anti-woman, in my opinion. He also counters by saying that boys are smarter.It seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece ""she"". To take the queen down a notch, they refer to a group or queens as a harem. To demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can. A male voice says, ""Off you go,"" in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind."
1,A waste of time and money,I agree with reviewer Mr. Dietz. I was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on Amazon for $24.99. Put it in and loaded it in. This game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all. No help menu either. We wasted at least 2 hours on it before I ejected it and apologized to her. There is nothing here to learn chess from.
3,very okay,Boo! This game is for BABIES. I have been studying chess for more than one year. I thought this game would be challenging. It's good for beginners though.
4,Love it!,"I bought this game from a software club on a whim. My 7 and 8 year old boys were sort of interested in chess, and my husband's name is Fritz. So I thought if I was lucky, the software could help them learn some of the basics of chess. It has FAR surpassed my expectations. They love it, and have spent HOURS playing it. They know how all the pieces move, have learned some of the finer points such as ""castling"", and still keep playing. I hear them repeating the little rhymes that the program uses to help them remember different strategies....""a knight on the rim is ugly and dim""....""pawns are afraid of nothing; they move straight ahead"", etc. In just a couple of weeks, they know WAY more than I know about chess. I would love to have this program in my middle school classroom, as I think my students there would enjoy it, as well."
4,"Great for Beginners, Intermediate and Experts","This was a great game for my 6 year old son. He's been playing chess for about 6 months and knows the basics. I wanted him to start to learn and understand strategy. This software reinforced the basic principles of the game, plus taught him some things that the book we checked out of the library didn't tell him. When he and I started playing regular games on his chess board, I was amazed at the strategies he was employing and the moves he was making based on what he learned from this computer game. Even my husband, who is a very good chess player, enjoyed playing the computer game and it gave father and son yet another fun activity to share. I highly recommend this product for young children at any level."
3,"""Learn to Play Chess...""","This was a Christmas gift, and I have not had a response as to the recipients' like or dislike of this product."
3,Sucks if you don't have internal cd drive.,"The game is fun and teaches the basics of the chess movement. I have no complaints of the game itself. The game is copy protected and requires you to have the disc in the cd drive when playing. This is all well and dandy but but my kid's laptop doesn't have a cd drive which is the case for almost all netbooks and many newer ""light"" notebooks. I can install the game using the external usb cd drive but then I have to keep plugging the external drive every time my daughter wants to play and it becomes a circus juggling act when she wants to move around the house with the laptop. There are tools on the internet that allows you to play without the physical cd but that's one extra step I didn't plan on taking just to play a game."
1,tot6al disappointment,"This is a poorly working program with no instructions or intuitive flow. It would not allow me to bypass its practice regimes which offered no explanations and so were useless and frustrating. It would not allow me to play chess in any mode without graduating from its pre-requisites.After an hour of frustration my five year old asked if we could just go back to the original ""board game"". I threw the program in the garbage."
1,Don't buy this worthless game unless you love to be frustrated,"I was looking for an intructional CD to help my daughter to learn chess. I read the reviews and endorsements and thought that this was what I was looking for. WRONG!First of all, the CD comes with no instruction book and you're left to try and figure out what you're supposed to do by yourself (good luck). I've spent over 2 hours on this thing so far and I still haven't seen one thing that would help my daughter to learn to play chess.I've emailed their 'help line' hoping to get some answers and never heard back from them.Save your money and your sanity and don't buy this CD."
1,waste of money,My kids play chess so I bought this to improve their skills. My 6 and 8 year olds were just not interested at all. It was a wate of money.
5,Wonderful!,"My daughter is 8 and I recently bought this for her. She's never played chess before and her attention span can be somewhat limited at times. I played this game for a little while before letting her play (she had chores to finish and so I could see if it was something she'd be able to do). At first I was a little worried, some of the arcade games seemed to me to be too hard and not have enough instructions. At any rate I loaded it up and let her play, and she spent over 6 hours in one weekend totally absorbed and loving every minute of it. Some of the arcade games were too hard so she just skipped those, I don't know if it will have any negative effect on her later game play, but so far so good! Anything that is educational and can keep a child absorbed for so long is well worth the money. I hope she finishes the game so she and I can play chess together!"
1,lacks any chess instruction,This is the worst chess learning material that I have purchased. The first 15 minutes is spent walking through a woods to get to a chess tournament. There is no way to skip this walk. The instruction is really poor.
5,A Landmark Work On A Very Important Subject!,"According to the EPA, Dioxin is one of the most toxic poisons known to the human race. That's all the science I need to know. The author is a well known and respected environmentalist who writes passionately about the subject. It's a shame this issue has fallen off the radar screen. Chlorine is a menace to our health and the health of the planet. It's that plain and simple!"
2,"Interesting topic, not terribly accurate","My comments are purely in reaction to the science in the book. Clearly this is not a book to approach research from. There are many misleading and some false statements. The references are on occassion non-existent, at least, I couldn't find them. It is the scientific contributors, not the author, I would guess, who are the problem."
5,"Wondeful History of the ""Black Hat Brigage""","Nolan's ""biography"" of the battle-torn Iron Brigade contains the most stirring description of the 1st day of battle at Gettysburg that I have ever read. His account of the bravery and heroism of these men is exceptional. At times I got a bit confused trying to keep track with whom was in charge of which regiment/brigade/division, etc., but this information is vital to the history of the brigade. This book also made me aware of the under-appreciated accomplishments of Lt. Col. Rufus Dawes who should be accorded the same recognition as other noble Union leaders during this battle, such as Chamberlain, Hancock and Warren."
3,Ray Conniff Las Numero 1,Generally the CD is very good but it does have some tracks of not so great quality. The DVD quality need enhacement the visual and music quality of the DVD are not so good the recordings are very old and should have been remastered and filtered to improve both video and music. This said over all they provide a good trip through memory lane for anyone that does like this type of music. You have to have developed your music memory bank to really appreciate this product.
4,Un buen album pop,"Rompecorazones es un album que no tuvo el exito debido. tampoco es precisamente un clasico del pop. sin embargo, es un buen disco para fanaticos del buen pop. el disco tiene un concepto muy europop al estilo de Kylie Minogue y Rachel Stevens en lo personal me gustan mucho los temas mas movidos del disco como el sencillo Amame, Besame; Las canciones tu y dame mas son muy buenas. el disco tambien tiene buenas baladas como sin tin y empezar de cero. en general el disco es divertido y muy agradable. super recomendado si disfrutaste de la musica de sentidos opuestos."
4,Fascinating first hand account,"This book is well written. I've read a great deal about Shackleton and seen videos, movies, DVDs and Hurley film. But this book provides detail where the second hand accounts do not. If you like sailing, you will especially love this book. The testament also highlights some areas of disagreement between Sir Ernst and Worsley, not of much import, but also not often discussed. Overall a required addition to any Expidetion library. But most of all, perhaps of the the greatest adventures ever told."
4,"Exciting, personal account of a perilous voyage.","In 1914, the British Trans-Polar Expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton became trapped in the Antartic ice in their ship, the Endurance. After drifting in the ice pack for several months, the Endurance was crushed, and the party camped on the ice as it continued its drift north. Their ice flow eventually broke up, and they launched the Endurance's boats in an effort to save themselves. This is where the story begins. Shackleton leads the three boat party to Elephant Island. Once there, he, Worsely, and four others sail 800 miles across the Southern Ocean in a 22 foot open boat to South Georgia in order to effect rescue. In the two week voyage, they battle the cold and storms of the Antartic winter, surviving a hurricane just before landfall. But- they are on the wrong side of South Georgia, and must cross the glaciers of South Georgia on foot. This is an amazing story about some amazing men and what they overcame"
2,Very Small!,"This shirt size although listed as a LARGE, was most definitely not. I buy large t-shirts all the time and this was very small even though the tag on the shirt stated it was a large."
4,Nice Shirt,The shirt was exactly as promised. I would love if it came in other colors other than blue. Shipping costs were a little high.
5,Why I kept My Past A Secret,I really enjoyed the book. The author gave excellent details about Ronda's life. I felt like I knew Ronda and was experiencing everything that she was going through. The story made me want more and I was disappointed that the story was short. I hope there is a continuation of the story.
5,A Struggle to over come,"""Why I Kept My Past A Secret"" by Teresa Browning is a powerfultestament of faith. It reveals some ugly truths of life and speaks to the power of persevering in the midst of adversity.Browning reveals hidden lessons about betrayal, family violence,addictions, personal tragedies, and about a young woman's desirefor friendship and love. The story runs deeper than passion of sex. It is more than a mere single mother's story of strugglesand hardships It is a journey to overcome............."
4,A must read!,Teresa leaves you wanting more with this short riveting story of a young girl who deals with the hand she was dealt in a most fascinating way.Hopefully there will be a sequel to this saga!
4,Wanting more!!,This book was a pleasure to read. The story line and characters were something I as an African American woman can truly relate to. I commend the author on telling a story we all needed to hear.
3,Great Starting Point,"This book offers an introduction to the world of cured Italian delicacies. The photos are great, but the descriptions lack real substance. Just enough information to peak your curiosity and inspire further learning. Unfortunately, if you want a more in depth look at regional Italian cured meats, you will have to seek additional resources. Enjoyable as an introduction to a complex and thoroughly fascination subject."
5,Comprehensive look at 1st Chechen War,"Honestly the best Western source for information on the First Chechen War. Good details overall of what happened and why. Good writing style and analysis on both sides of the conflict. Required reading for anyone trying to learn about the First Chechen War, or understand the ongoing Second Chechen War."
2,Anti-Russian,"This book reads like a pro-Chechen propaganda piece given to the a European Human Rights council. I wouldn't read it for its objectiveness; however, the dates, names and locations have been researched as thuroughly as possible."
4,A good book about Chechnya wars,"I think in this book will be very good for the readers who want to know about 1994-96 chechnya war. Author show why russians does not win the war. The whole war is described quite precisious (as it can be:): battles, tactics, etc... And i think this book will be ok for readers who want to study 1999-x war.It will bring some answers to emerging questions in our days."
4,"Informative and Technical, but kind of one sided.","This book was almost exactly what I was looking for when trying to make my own hooch. A lot of great information and explanation, the only thing that bugged me was that to follow his instructions exactly you have to make this fairly large and very expensive still from a water heater! Yep, I said it ""a small water heater"". And he talks about having you do a beer stripping run in a pot still before you put it in his reflux ""water heater"" still. A LOT of equipment is required and it's not cheap. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the art or someone who is a beginner."
2,Way Too Technical.,If you are looking to this book to learn more about moonshining then don't buy this one! This is a pretty technical book on making whiskey the commercial way. It is mainly for small and large commercial distillers. This is NOT a beginner's guide!
4,As American as Corn Whiskey,This book is the best book I've ever read on the subject of making corn whiskey. It's a step by step process that allows the average red-blooded all American to take pride in an activity that is in the class of Apple pie and baseball. A must read if only for its entertaining value.
4,great book for novice to exper.,"great book for the beginer in making beer, wine or shine! gives lots of ideas. new ones on a still. easy to follow detailed instructions, along with tech. reasons why you do somethings and to help out even the expert wine and beer maker!! great book"
1,Too Technical,"The title leads you to believe that it's a beginners how to guide, etc. But it takes way too long to make points and gets too heavy into over engineering what is meant to be a single run corn whiskey. Don't wast your money."
5,A working how to.,This is a great addition to the want to be and the dabbling moonshiner. It answers many of the detail questions that you need to go about making actually make a viable product.
4,Handy little chain saw,"As long as you realize that this little guy is not for heavy duty cutting you will get along fine with it. My only critisism is that the oiler could use some updating, it is fragile and leaks if left with oil in it.Overall I consider it a very handy tool."
1,Poorly written,"According to Amazon author Paul A. Woods is, among other things, a researcher. This is not apparent from reading this book.I was not expecting a literary classic but at least some accuracy would have been nice.Much of the book reads like bad fanfiction. The author introduces a Jason Voorhees who is willing to follow the requests of someone other than his mother. Jason also uses a hunting rifle as a hunting rifle rather than a club or spear. The poor mischaracterization of the main character stands as the most glaring error in the book.This is not the only error in the book however. The author also introduces a laser pointer with the ability to burn flesh, a .48 caliber handgun, and a pump-action double-barreled shotgun.The ending of the book is forced and makes little sense. It reads as though the author was told to hurry and decided to kill several characters out of spite.Waste of money and time."
1,ZYLISS 20556 = Junk,"I got 4 of these at least 3 were junk. The main problem is the metal piece, its not strong enough. I broke 2 trying to put them in a soda bottle, the metal bent then snapped the plastic piece its attached to, well shattered actually. I used a third and tried it once again, grabbing the neck of the bottle for better leverage and pressed slooooowly this time and just bent the metal. The force you need to apply to get these things to seal is too much for what ever metal they used. I have 3 of the older style ones called ""Zyliss leak-proof bottle stopper"" and they work great. They have a slightly different look to them but there not as cheaply made as the ZYLISS 20556."
2,Way too flimsy,"It's far too easy to bend this. Unless you have just the right size bottle, you're more likely to snap this in half then close it. I bought three and broke two right off the bat. The third one's still working because I'm *extremely* careful about applying pressure to it.Way, *way* too flimsy."
1,"weak lever, ruins a good stopper","I bought three of these. When they work, they're great--no leaks. BUT, after only a week, one of them became useless. The pressure needed to activate the rubber stopper in the wine bottle was too great for the soft metal lever, and the lever bent before the stopper was expanded.If Zyliss made the levers out of stronger metal, these stoppers would be perfect."
5,More than wonderful!!!,"This book was a very refreshing thing to read! Mrs. Elliot shows how it is a good and desirable thing to be a true woman of God (submission and letting the husband lead). It was no mistake that a woman is a woman and a man a man! God has placed us in our rightful places. She also shows how the woman's roll is just as inportant as tha man's, it is just different!I found this very freeing to read, because I now see how God has made me! I would give this book the highest rateings!!!"
5,How to be a Godly woman,"This an awesome book, with timeless themes and perspecive on life. This is for women seeking that ""gentle and quiet spirit"" of 1st Peter 3, and great at explaining what that is, and the unexpected joy that comes with it."
3,Let Me Be A Woman,The book is a bit hard to relate to since the author wrote it purposefully for her daughter before her wedding. Yet there are still some thoughts quite encouraging. I really recommend Elisabeth Elliot's devotional books.
1,This is the book that helped me leave the church,"The author advises giving all the authority in the household to your husband so that when anything goes wrong, you can blame him! I thought this was one of the more useful suggestions. ;) Other than that, I got a slightly queesy feeling reading her admonitions, like I was being convinced that something not good for me acturally was. I received this book as a confirmation gift. Not a good gift!"
5,A life in God's plan,"Written to her daughter upon marriage, Let Me Be A Women is full of short thoughts about the meaning of femininity and being secure in God's calling for you. The first time I had read this I was a young teen and found the book a little hard to understand as it's written is such short, personal thoughts. This summer a few women and I did a study with this book and each found it to be so full of truth (whether we wanted to agree with it or not) and it made me reflect upon my own life. God predestined me to be a woman. This is His plan for me and it's not inferior to men, but just a different job. This book helped me embrace the differences and begin embracing God's unique plan for my life!"
2,not a whole lot better than legion 1.06b,"dont waste you time or money on this. wait for TOTAL WAR: ROMEto come out. If you have the upgraded version of the original legion, stick with it instead. On my machine, running winxp home, pIII 933, 512k ram, the game locks up too many times to make it an enjoyable diversion."
5,Attractive and very accurate at a bargain price,"Seiko makes outstanding watches for reasonable prices. This ladies watch is very attractive and quite reasonably priced. Furthermore, it's much more accurate than most Rolex watches which are far more expensive. Though finely built, and very expensive, most Rolex watches have mechanical movements guaranteed to an accuracy of only 2 minutes (120 seconds) per month. This Seiko watch is also finely built and its quartz movement gives it an accuracy of 15 seconds per month or better -- 8 times more accurate than most Rolexes. Beauty, accuracy, and dependability at a reasonable price make this Seiko watch a winner."
4,good gift,bought this for my mom. She was very pleased. we had to buy extra links for it to fit better.
2,Watch Band cannot be replaced!,"I purchased this watch for my mother. She has a hard time with the clasp on thewatch band and did not wear it at all. I went to several jewelers to get a goldstretch band and was told the watch band cannot be replaced! They said the bandis ""married"" to the watch and the parts cannot be replaced! Now it's useless tome. Very disappointed. The fact that the watch band cannot be replaced and youhave to buy a new watch if you want a different watch band should have beendisclosed in the advertisement! It's past the return time, so I am stuck with it.What a waste of money!"
5,Perfection... the best substitute for sitting by the sea,"I came across this book in a bookstore and was immediately captured. As a native San Diegan that recently relocated to Texas, I was starved not only for the sand, the sea air, the water and the waves, but also for the entire experience of sitting on the beach and absorbing the sights around me. Farber's book perfectly captures the entire experience with exquisite photography complemented by a collection of thoughts and reflections on ""the sea"" by various famous people of our time. With this book, I felt that I was sitting on the seashore and sharing my impressions and thoughts with another person who held the same admiration for the sea and the beach. Beautiful presentation and collaborative work by Farber. Highly recommended for a coffee table or bedside book, or to give as a gift."
5,Book review,"I found the book to be inspiring and filled with facts, information and remedys for healing and healthy living. The 7 day fast, the cleansing and supplements, all made an incredible difference to me and my Mom, who has cancer. I purchased 4 more books and gave them friends and family in hopes they can be inspired to improve their health through life style changes."
5,One of the best books I have read!,This is a great book for understanding what causes toxic buildup in your body and what you can do to get rid of those toxins and keep your body clean. This is one of the first approaches I would look at if I was diagnosed with cancer. I love this book!!!
1,Bad phone - little help from Panasonic,"While using this phone it will cut out for about 5 seconds while it switches to another security code. During this time you cannot hear the other person on the line and they have to repeat what they said. This happens every time I use the phone. I called Panasonic and they said to send it in (I pay the shipping cost) and they will replace it with a ""reconditioned"" phone. The phone is about a month old."
3,Take Note!,"Some good things to know before buying:1. The talking caller ID doesn't 'play"" until after the 2nd ring. By that time, if you realize you want to pick up the call, you have very little time before the answering machine or voicemail picks up. It also announces the calls as they are displayed on CID (i.e. you have a call from ""Smith John"". Why couldn't the software reverse the last and first names!? Very annoying2. Voice enhancing feature is useless. The calls sound worse, ambient noise is amplified.3. 90% of my calls sounded great but 10% of the time I did experience a signficant echo. This was enough for me to return the phone.4. You cannot use the base keypad while speaking on handset (unlike other Panasonic models)"
1,It is Trash,"My unit (3DAXA044546, made in Malaysia) did stop working (and only was blinking) after its guarantee had expired. Reason: A very minor change of charge that doesn't even stopped the Computer at its side to work! (I had it all the time on the wall, not on the surge protector). I threw it to the trashcan today!"
3,Great One,"Once my friend told me to use the sea salt. Then I used `Marshalls Creek Spices Salt'. It was good in quality but tastes bitter. So, I took this Sayulita Sea SaltSayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSaltwhich is organic and looks so fresh. It makes the taste great. You should own it earlier."
5,the gelheads!,"I first heard of this band when i was 14 years old i was on a college trip to Chicago and we heard them playing on the boardwalk. they sounded just like green day, they were amazing, they had great vocals, drums and guitar rifts. i had to buy their cd it was only $10. I listened to it everyday, i remembered every word. then my friend borrowed it and never gave it back. since the band broke up it was almost impossible to find this CD. But if you are a fan of Green day you will love this album the only downfall is it only has 7 songs on it but it is still worth it."
5,Flower Speed Drying,"Of all the art making tools I own, outside of a sharp exacto blade, this one gets the most use. I frequently make cards with dried flowers and leaves and love the ability to pick something and use it the same day. It can take a while to master the power of an individual microwave, but once that is understood the Microwave Flower Press makes short work of flower drying. Some flowers are better than others for drying. White flowers, for example, are easy to scorch and take careful watching. Flowers with thick centers like daisies need to have the delicate petals protected with damp paper or cloth while the center dries completely but even ""mistakes"" can turn into lovely art. This is a terrific product, well worth the cost. Papermaker,Lynne M."
4,Flower Press Fun,I have had so much fun with this flower press. It is so easy. If I were ordering again I would have ordered the bigger one. The only thing I wish is that it the directions had more craft ideas.
5,Best tool I ever got,"Nice tool who loves craft and dry flowers/leaves. Works really great, also available in bigger size but smaller is good for me.Now I can make my own dry flowers for craft and frames and for gift wraps."
4,Great book,This is a great book. I have lost many pounds using the methods in the book. But I replace his Nautilus routines with my own free weight and other routines. The only quibble I have with the book is that there may be too much sugar in the diet. Darden states that the diet is not for everybody but I believe there is too much sugar for anybody. It doesn't seem to harm anything for the normal individual but it does encourage a sweet tooth.
3,Forgot how old this book was,Bought the book to get recipes for Nautilus Diet. Surprised how dated the pictures are. Probably will copy the recipes and throw away the book.
5,All hail to those little Tasmanian bees!,"This is the best honey ever! I used to get it years ago in New York, but had not had any for a very long time. This winter, with all the talk about the effectiveness of cough remedies, I read about honey being a good alternative to cough syrup. My husband had a nagging one, so I thought why not get him the best! Who knows about the cough part, but it is just great, great honey! We absolutely love this honey! So glad I found it again on Amazon!"
2,Wish the Content we as Good as the Cover,"I cannot honestly recommend this text to you. It is just a mess crammed full of material that is poorly organized.We don't need to learn Movie Maker from scratch. It's a task-oriented program! Don't spend time telling me what the File menu is, tell me how to add a transition between two frames quickly!I just don't think the approach in this book is useful for the true Movie Maker user. I'd look into a more general-purpose digital video book that focuses on Movie Maker 2 as the primary software to get the job done easily (such as Perry's Digital Video in a Snap (ISBN: 0672325691)).Unlike a program such as Excel than an investor or financial planner will want to master in great detail, the Movie Maker user needs to know how to do select things at any one time depending on the job they have to do."
3,it is ok,"Movie maker is harder than you think if you really want to edit. This book gets you going but the process is not ""easy"". It is a time eater. The book is helpful - the process of using the program is frustrating."
4,Great Info on Movie Maker 2!,"All the authors gave great info and saved me lots of time in learning the software. Movie Maker 2 works great and I've made two 30 minute DVD movies within three months using camcorder video, pictures, music, transitions, titling, and credits. The editing process is easy and fun to do as pointed out in the book. For the price and knowledge given by these experts, you can't miss making a great movie. I do suggest having enough computer RAM (at least 512 MBS for 30 minutes of CD or DVD video and lots more if all camcorder video is used or longer movies are made) to make the process easier."
4,Excellent book to learn the details of MM2,This book will give you all the info and help you need to successfullyuse Movie Maker 2. The examples are excellent. The website of the authorsis useful. I recommend it to anyone going or trying to use MM2. It would be difficult to master without some help.
1,Looks Like Rejects,"I would be embarrassed to give this set to anyone. The 4 glasses are of varying weights and thicknesses. The difference in the glasses is dramatic, as shown in the pic I uploaded. Plus, heaviest glass, which seems to be the best, has a defective bubble in the side of it. We are returning these glasses to Amazon."
3,"Not what I would call a ""Gift Set""","I like these glasses - they are the perfect size and shape for mojitos - but the product description is misleading. From other reviews I knew it didn't come with a muddler (which one might think would be part of a ""gift set"") so I bought an OXO muddler - works great! But the images led me to believe that the ""gift set"" part was that the glasses came in a nice box, wooden or otherwise. Nope. Just an ordinary cardboard box. Although I am happy with the glasses, I would recommed shopping for different ones that work the same and don't try to fool you with ""gift set"" misnomers."
3,"Nice Glasses, Terrible Packaging...","I like the glasses, but I bought this item as a groomsmen gift and in the picture the glasses are set in a nice wooden box with good looking pictures, the item I received is in a CARDBOARD! box with a color laser picture on the cardboard. It looks nothing like the picture. Definitely not a nice wood box, it looks very, very cheap and I am pretty irritated Amazon would false advertise the set like that. I will be calling them we will see what happens."
2,the quality changed,"I purchased the exact same item from Amazon about 18 months ago. The same picture and description is still used. I wanted to add more glasses to my set and expected the same item based on the picture and description. However, the glasses are very different. My first set is a much nicer quality with thick glass walls. The current set is very thin and feels like it will break very easily. Not what I expected! Not worth the price."
3,"Works, but leaves room for improvement","It does what it's supposed to, but not with much pizzaz.The bike holding arms are softer tubular metal that bend easily. I have lightweight bikes on it, but doubt it would be trustworthy with a 35+lb cruiser or freeride MTB hanging on it.Height adjustment is primitive but fairly straight forward and easy with pinch screw on the wrap-around dual arm. Unfortunately, the pinch bolt requires a wrench so it is not fast to adjust the height of the arms.And unlike other designs, the arms of the bike holding part are one piece meaning they cannot be independently adjusted for height.The stand is solid and fit together fine. However, if I were doing it over again, I probably would go with the Thule.http://www.amazon.com/Thule-BSTK2-Bike-Stacker/dp/B001PQVOOY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1347636718&sr;=8-1&keywords;=thule+bike+standThule Universal Bike Stacker"
2,VERY DISAPOINTED,"Don't bother with this DVD, buy the CD instead. I expected cool shots of all the musicians, Brecker, Weckl etc. Instead I got silly 60's style stoned out graphics & boring USA city pictures. There are all to infrequent shots of the amazing musos recording the album, That's what I wanted, the music is amazing but the video footage is a disgrace. As I said buy the CD & just try to imagine how fantastic it would of been to be there, because this DVD will never tell you. SORRY!!!!!!!!!"
5,The best side!,"A fanantastic album, a sensational interpretation of Bernsteins music, excellent for listening to if you know the origional music well."
5,Great DTS recording,"The big band / horn arrangements are excellent and the tracks just totally jump. DTS version is worth every penny, so just buy it! (If you don't have a DTS setup yet, what are you waiting for?)"
5,Excellent performance and recording.,"West Side Story can turn one on or off. This rendition will satisfy Jazz lovers. Good band, good arrangements, good recording.Highly recommended."
4,A great example of American Music .,"Great arrangements , top notch soloists , including a burning Michael Brecker , for this engaging version of the West Side Story ballet .Really modern , perfect played , super cool stilysh session . For me a must to have ."
2,Partially disappointing,"I now own the Audio CD, the DTS CD and the DVD of this Grusin production. To say it clearly: Grusins interpretatin of the West Side Story songs is simply perfect. I bought the DVD to see the musicians and singers. The shots of the recording sessions and interviews are quite OK in this sense, but the movie clips (or just photographs!) and, especially, the boring media player animations with some songs are definitely not what I want to look at. If you like an outstanding sound, buy the DTS CD. The DVD soundrack can not compete with it."
1,dissapointing!!!!!,"I already owned the cd when i saw the dvd. If you hoping to watch a musical performance or hoping to see the musicians in action, you will be dissapointed like me. so Don't waste your money, what you get is simply graphics like those you see in display in an EQ or your car stereo systems eq effect display. Just get the cd would be good enough."
1,"Good Idea, I guess....","I guess it was not a bad idea to merge Dionne Warwick with the current Hip/hop & Rap commuinity with ""What the world needs Now"" but this is one time a good idea didn't pan out."
5,"Romantic, historical, and filled with simple rich foods!",I have dozens of Italian cookbooks. This is one of the best... and maximizes the simple style and ingredients of Italy's best flavors. The photography and writing are equally good.
1,Italy the incredibly plain food cookbook,"This is AWFUL. Most of these recipes even the most beginning cook would know of or could simply figure out on their own - if they wanted bland food. Many if not most recipes are very few ingredients and fairly common sense. Chicken, rosemary, balsamic and oil. I didn't need a $50 cookbook to teach me that one - or any of them that would actually be tasty."
2,not good,"This cd gets pretty old, pretty fast. This is a heavy cd but the lyrics and singer is what kills it. The vocals sound almost like Hatebreed except the singer feels the need to curse about 20 times in each song. Im not saying cursing in cds is bad it just gets very repetative. Pick up their cd ""You Dont Need To Be Blood To Be Family"" it is much better."
2,What is this?,"This isnt the Throwdown I used to listen to. Its not bad, but not at all what I was expecting. Are these guys even staright edge anymore? Is this the same singer? Im very unhappy with the direction they have went in. VERY Hatebreed-esk. In a time when metal and hardcore seem to be getting bigger these guys take a step backward and now sound like evryone else. Damn it."
1,HORRIBLE,"This CD is complete garbage. Sorry. Nothing redeming. Tough guy nonsense. Same old hardcore from the mid-90's. yuck. I tried to sell this one used and no one would buy it. If you like tuffy core and vocals that sound like they are coming out of a bouncer's mouth then this might be for you. I prefer the heaviness of Converge or Botch to this predictable mess. oh, and the use of curse words make this super original. Save your cash."
2,Only for sXe sadly...,"Im sorry, but I sold this CD a day err two after I purchased it. It reminded me of a Hatebreed hybrid, horrible horrible. And the 'straight edge' (sXe) lyrics were really annoying... good ridence"
1,Throwdown? you mean PANTERA!?!?,"seriously, this album is the biggest pantera rip off ever, im not even into pantera anymore, but as soon as i heard it, i remembered... i guess if your still into pantera, youll love this album, but i guess i dont feel like they can ever truly be replicatedso give me my glasses and a sweater, cause this cd is xTUFFx emough for the both of us!"
3,blahhh......worth a listen,"to be honest, i didnt have any expectations when i bought this cd....but i went out an bought it. overall this cd has good rhythm and good double bass beats and the vocalist's voice is just right for this kind of music....but the thing that i hate about this cd is the lyrics...all these guys sing about is kicking peoples asses...and encouraging you to do the same...dont get me wrong..if im disrespected..ill kick somebodys ass...but this is all they talk about on this cd....and the lyrics are not written poetically either... besides that this cd is not so bad.....but i wouldnt buy it if i knew wat kind of thing i was getting.....besides that...music is okay....only buy this if you like hatebreed or other bands like that.....otherwise...stay away!!!"
2,This is emo compared to metal,"""Haymaker is by far, the HEAVIEST THING on the planet. If you disagree with me, then you must not know good music.""oh please...i listen to music so heavy that it will make a throwdown fan curl up into a corner and cry.this album was decent but nothing amazing. I dont exactly see a punk influence at all in this band. It sounds like hardcore (which is mostly just a subgenre of metal). But please stop saying this is the heaviest band. This band is not original, if you want the newest hatebreed album then buy this."
4,Pretty great cd but stupid people suck,"As i lay dying sucks ass...this is much better than as i lay dying, negative approach or any bands you idiots are babbling about. Just shut up. There's no need to classify music. Give it up you vultures. By the way, this band was amazing at ozzfest. Their singer has so much intensity. But, as one guy said, they do go a little far on the whole straight edge thing."
1,Does all CA hardcore suck!?!?!?!,"Not to pull and east vs. west thing, but what's up with the lame hardcore in the west coast???? This CD sucks hard. It's a chug chug chug metal album, no originality, and lame lyrics about ""loyalty,"" ""pride,"" ""respect,"" and all they cliche crap that was done by way better bands with better songs. I couldn't even listen to the whole album. If you want some good metal-core style, pick up Dead and Buried or Full Blown Chaos"
1,better than Hatebreed? nah.,"The hippy before this comment does not know good music or lyrics if he thinks this album is better than hatebreed. Negative. Not a bad band at all, but does not have the persistance of Hatebreeds guitars nor lyrics."
1,Throw Away this trash...,"1st of all, I was the biggest Throwdown fan back a few years back. Beyond Repair and then the two EPS afterwards were NOTHING like the music scene at the time. Pure Originality. The production was heavy, the screaming was ridiculously crazy, and the shows were killer. NOW, with Haymaker I rate them as the worst band on the planet. They are a modern day Metallica, hungry for money and publicity. They even had an interview with Hot Topic. MTV is next!!! The new cd is not heavy at all compared to their older stuff. The bass is turned down, the drums are slowed to a crawl...Oh yeah, and the new vocals suck. Cliche. Hatebreed anyone? Bring back the old singer. Is there anything not wrong with this album? THeir live shows are awesome. It still can't hide the fact their music now sucks. One word: ""Sellout."" Just like the song on Beyond Repair."
2,"Not great, not bad","I listened to cd and I dont know how to explain this cd. I cant really explain to well I guess, but i'll try. The problem I had was the swearing. I usually dont have a problem with swearing, but the way this band did it ruined the cd. It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*. It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this. The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd. If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd. This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place. HA! Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place. Thats what the problem with the cd was. Just add it here and there, not every other word. Probably would have been a better cd that way. To fans fo Throwdown, please do complain. Everyone has an opinion and that is mine."
3,Not Quite Hatebreed or Terror,"Throwdown falls short of the mark those two bands set.. The vocals aren't tight and the guitars are a notch below.. The breakdowns aren't anywhere as powerfull or inspiring..Sorry but, they dont measure up.."
2,El Ultimo Cuple meets 70's remakes,"I only bought this CD because it had a few songs from Sarita's movie ""El Ultimo Cuple"" other than that the other song that seem to be from her 70's era are dispensable. The CD is okay, I like the songs from her movies the other stuff isn't so great."
3,"Nice Usability, Poor Fit","I also bought this headset from Verizon for the Samsung SCH-A950. Sound quality is quite good, never once heard the dreaded ""can you repeat that?"" from those I called. The volume controls and multi-function button are easy to reach and simple to navigate ""blindly."" My one complaint (and cause for me to return it) was that it felt way too lose on my ear. Even with the flexible behind-the-ear arm, turning my head side-to-side would result in it swinging around. Heaven forbid you put the car's convertible top down: the BT150 flops in the wind..."
2,Poor sound quality and echos,"I got this headset with my LG VX8100 so I couldn't return it...otherwise I would've. The sound quality is fair at best. Whenever I turn up the volume there's an echo heard by me and on the other end. On a positive note, it's very comfortable given all the adjustments you can make to the ear hook."
2,not so hot,"I bought this unit from the Verizon store to pair with my Motorola E815. Sound quality wasn't too bad but there were some very annoying traits which caused me to return the product.1. While wearing it I would get a single beep in my ear. Not knowing what this meant I would look at my phone and the BT symbol would be off. But than the phone start magically dialing whoever I last spoke with.2. Why do we need the STUPID strobe light? This thing is truly annoying at night in the car. Stupid useless ""feature?""3. Felt ""floppy"" on my ear. Just not good. It was light enough but annoying.This has been returned for a Motorla H700. I will report on this after enough time to try it."
2,Echo a Problem,"Was very pleased with this headset until people on the other end of the line started complaining of an annoying echo. Very disappointing since the BT150 functioned very well otherwise. Only remedy for the echo was the turn the volume down very low. This would lesson the echo, but would be too low to hear well even in a normal noise level environment."
2,echo problems,"This headset has echo problems for the person you're speaking to.It's light and easy to put on, but the echo problems are a show-stopper for me."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE CD'S,I know im late writing this review but i just have to say this band is great i love all the songs on the cd speacilly papercut this band is going to be around for along time
5,I like it,"This book is really really good. My older cousin Andrew, 13 like the people Linkin Park. I'm only 9 so my mommy doesn't tink its approopriat. but linkin park has a sweet beet. I got to go to the potty now. Bye bye"
1,Completely useless.,"Let me ask you a completely logical question: Why would you want to buy this book (which only features the lyrics to songs off of Linkin Park's ""Hybrid Theory"" album), when you can read these lyrics anywhere on the internet for free? Not only that, but the booklet that comes with the ""Hybrid Theory"" album contains the lyrics to each song anyway, so there really is absolutely no point in getting this book."
1,Outstanding...,"""Crawling in my skin...these words that do not heal"" Where would rock and roll be without the brilliant lyrics of Linkin Park? Yeah, I'm saving for this book. I've been hanging out on street corners and asking people for quarters hoping I might be able to one day buy this book. Yeah, this book is great. About as great as a chapped lip."
3,Kinda redundant.,"Well, this book had a lot of potential. But it kinda fell flat. What the problem is, is that it shows you the same scales in every key. As a guitarist, i only need to SEE the scale in one position, then i can play it in any key. So seeing it moved up one fret on the neck in another section is entirely useless. It might be good for starting out, but i'd reccomend something that 1) Shows you the way the scale is constructed, 2)does not show the same scale over and over and 3)has A variety of scales. This book tells you the 7 modes, major and minor pentatonic, and not a whole lot else."
1,Paul: A Man of Grit and Grace,"The author is probably a great guy personally, but his writing falls very short. The book does not even address Paul's views on the role of women, or on homosexuality--two areas where people of our times need guidance. It seems as if the author wanted to be ""politically correct"" and not offend anyone.He doesn't even address, with any authority, the conflict between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark. He just basically says they should have worked it out. I was completely disappointed in the book."
5,I Love this Book,"Paul's life is a great inspiration to the New Testament Church. His live depicts how God takes those who are unworthy and use them for His cause. Swindoll shows us how Paul did everything possible to stop the move of God before He accepted Christ, but after accepting Christ Paul was sure to not take the grace of God for granted. God used Paul to pen the majority of the books in the New Testament, but Swindoll gives us insight of the life of Paul not only when He was at His best but also when He was at His worst. Paul's life is a life of triumph and victory of pass failures."
1,Cheap and nasty,"I recently received this product for my Garmin 305 and was not impressed. The product comes with a sprung plastic holder which is then sewn into a velcro strap. The main issue I have is that the Velcro strap is too rigid and too small for a mans wrist (unless you are a skinny guy!). The other thing that I don't like is the mounting option to go on the bicycle as the clip can possibly spring the watch out of it's cradle if one goes over a bump. I have a Polar HRM and they have a simpler and better solution. They used the watch's strap (the normal strap that you use around your wrist) and add a cradle to the bicycle that makes the circumference adequate that one can secure the strap as normal. Very simple, very effective and cheap. No 'over engineered' solutions! It looks like Garmin didn't allow someone to do a reality check before commissioning this product and allowed Engineering to design whatever they thought was cool!"
5,AWESOME!!,"Man, what a great product! I hadn't seen this product before, and had planned on buying the mount that looks like a plastic wrist you mount on you handlebars. I saw this option and had to go watch some YouTube videos about it to see how it worked. I was a bit apprehensive, but it looked like a good value, especially since I really didn't care for the wrist straps on the 305, they always pinched skin and pulled hair whenever I put it on or tried to adjust the little band that hold the extra strap. So getting the mount and a different strap seemed like the way to go. It was! The Velcro strap is so much more comfortable, the mounting system is just like the plastic holsters for the cell phones, so it seems solid. Very happy, already purchased a couple more of the mounts for my other bikes, very slick system."
5,Excelente!,"Funciona perfectamente de acuerdo a lo que se esperaba. Estoy feliz utilizándolo para correr y andar en bicicleta. Lo recomiendo para todos los que quieran adquirirlo, si funciona."
4,Very useful kit; somewhat worried that it will break soon,"Nice product, easy to install.The armband from your original 205/305 is removed, and replaced with a hard plastic cradle attached to a velcro armband. Your Garmin can be detached from this armband, and inserted into a similar device attached to your bike handlebars. (Can also be used to attach the Garmin to, e.g., a rowing shell.)Since the plastic cradle must flex in order to insert or remove te Garmin, I am a bit worried that it will break soon. No problems in one month of use, though."
1,Not secure enough!!,"I bought this kit after reading positive reviews about it, and in fact was happilly using it for 6 months. That is until my Garmin FELL OFF the wristrap during a city run. I didn't notice it until a while later, so have clearly lost the unit. Good idea, but in my experience the mount is not secure enough to use with a $200+ piece of equipment!!! An expensive mistake."
1,A very expensive wrist band with no watch - get the mount instead,"I loved this for about 3 months of Ironman training until I was running in the Houston marathon and realized my expensive GPS and Heart Rate training device had suddenly and silently transformed into a VERY expensive piece of plastic and velcro. Needless to say, my Garmin was gone. I highly recommend buying the bike mount instead of this. Takes about 10 seconds during your T2 to get it off and then I just strap it to my wrist once I start running. (The time it takes to put on the bike doesn't matter because even the 310's aren't good in the water, so my Garmin starts out on the bike and a $20 watch from target times my swim and then gets left in T1) Avoid losing your Garmin and don't buy the quick release."
2,"Works OK, but not on rough roads","I got the quick release kit several months ago, and have been using it with no problems until today. I found out that even if the GPS is securely attached to the mounting bracket, it can come loose on rough roads. I hit a bump on my ride today, and my $200 GPS went sailing. I checked before I left to ensure that the unit was securely fastened in the bracket, and it was. Luckily I found my GPS and it survived, but others may not be so lucky. That's a lot of money to trust to a bracket that's not 100% secure. Keep on the bike paths or smooth roads, and you may be alright, but I no longer trust my kit and have removed it from my bike."
5,Excited to use my Forerunner for biking!,"I have had a Garmin ForeRunner 305 for two years now - it's been such an awesome training tool for half-marathons and other runs. I also have recently started doing triathlons and road bike races. I had previously been wearing my forerunner on my wrist, but am excited to now have it mounted on the handle bars. The mounting process was easy and like other reviewers, I like the new velcro strap. I have small wrists and it seems to fit well."
3,"Great idea for multisport users, but has a design flaw","I purchased the quick release kit for my Garmin 305. It is a really great idea for those interested in using it for multisport. I really like the idea of the velco strap, however I have small wrists so the strap makes a flap at the end from the extra band when closed. Not a big deal, but a little annoying. I purchased the quick release back in June 2010 and have used it for both running and biking. I used the quick release band for running and it works really well. However, on my bike, it has fallen off twice and once was during a race. It has happened both times when I went over a bump in the road. If the roads are not bumpy, I haven't had a problem. Great design by Garmin though, because the watch survived both falls off the bike!I wouldn't recommend for biking, but works great to get easily on and off for running."
5,AWESOME!,Definitely worth it! Easily transfers from wrist mount to bike mount. I even bought another bike mount for my second bike. Love this product!
5,Forerunner 305 Bike and Wrist Quick Release Strap,Five Stars are well earned for a well designed product. The delivery was easily within two days. The wrist strap is much better than the original plastic strap that came with my Forerunner 305. The strap removal tool makes the removal of the original strap a breeze. (It can also be used for any other watch band removals) The Forerunner 305 is then easily installed and removed from the quick release wrist strap. The Bike Strap is even easier and requires no tools. Works great and is very secure on the bike. Instructions included were perfect and accurate.
3,Lost my 305 for 2.5 hours,"I use this mount for road riding and running. For what it is designed for, that is a quick way to switch between sports, it is a fairly effective method. The trouble lies in if your road or mountain bike rides occur over rough surfaces. In Atlanta the city government has allowed the streets to deteriorate to a point where our group rides are being re-routed due to deplorable road conditions. On one such bumpy ride, my 305 apparently bounced off without my knowledge. A couple of miles past the ejection point I was shocked to look down and find a blank mount where my 305 usually rests.The good news is that I found it after a 2.5 hour search in the thick ivy and tall grass lining the road. What a pain, but it would have been much worse to take a $180 hit had I not found the unit. Anyway, have gone back to using the wrist strap around a Polar mount until Garmin comes up with a better mounting solution. If you ride bumpy roads with this mount, keep an eye on your GPS."
3,Not for Extreme Sports,"I love my Garmin 305. Works great. I bought this kit b/c I run and mountain bike a lot and this kit makes transitions easy between wrist and bike.Worked so good that I decided to strap it on to my wrist while I was at the motocross track. Not a good idea. One lap and it had popped out of the quick release wrist strap. Same thing with bike mount kit.So, the lesson is it works great if you aren't going to be in a situation where it is really going to get thrown around a lot. I would not trust this kit for my mountain bike in extreme situations where it is going to get rough (i.e. think Porcupine Rim Trail out at Moab). Other than that it works great!"
4,flexibiliti,"You can put it on your bicycle, release it and take it on your wrist at once - realy fast and easy."
2,Loose for swim battle,"I like this release kit because it is very easy to move from wrist to bike and from bike to wrist. It works great at training, but did not on triathlon race. You have to be carefull if you are planning to use on race. Last time when I joined the triathlon race and came out from the swim, I realized that my Garmin Forerunner is gone. It dropped off when battling with other swimmers. I'm planning to buy Garmin Forerunner again, but I will not attach it on swim part."
1,NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE,MY FORERUNNER 305 HAS JUST BEE RUN OVER BY A CAR AFTER COMING OUT OF THIS ITEM...DO NOT BUY IT.After reading the reviews of others who this has happened to I decided that the fault must have been fixed or at least the other reviewers had done something wrong and I wouldn't let anything happen as I would be careful.This morning cycling to work after checking that the device was very secure as always I set off; half way I went over a small bump (I ride a fast road bike so avoid bumps at all costs)and I can only assume it had popped of then as when I next looked down it had gone. I went back over my route to find it nearly snapped in half by a car and completely ruined.I called Garmin and am sending both the Forerunner and the bike mount off for them to investigate. I will update with news from Garmin when I receive it.
4,Nice product,This product puts your Garmin 305/205 right in front of you on your bike. The quick release mount works great and you can take it from your bike to wrist in seconds. The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is it does not fit on my Vision base bar for my tri bike. Works awesome for my road bike though.
3,"Good, not great","If you have a Forerunner 305 unit, and use it for both running and biking, this is almost a necessary accessory. Switching the band on and off the unit was a hassle, and this eliminates that, which is why I bought it. It does have some shortcomings: one, I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is, two, the wristband is far too short. I think the problem really is that the material used on the end of the band is basically solid/too stiff for the last 1.5 inches. Most fast-wrap bands I have on other watches are flexible except for the last .25 inch or so, giving them much more range for fit."
1,"Perfect, except when you lose your Garmin","A fantastic product, easy to install, watch snaps in and out of the mount with a little effort. Makes it easy to transfer your Gramin from bike to bike. All great.Except... when you look down to check your Garmin and IT ISN'T THERE!I had one issue with it popping out during a cyclocross race, but it was after a jump and I couldn't really fault it for that. On my last road ride, looked down during a hill sprint and it was just gone.My impression is that it bailed a little earlier when I hit a pothole.When all is said and done, this mount should be able to withstand a bump without the computer committing suicide.Don't buy if you want to keep your watch."
3,Q-R wrist strap OK but hard on 305 attachment points,Quick Release kit is OK but if you're back and forth between a bike and your wrist a lot I fear the plastic on the Forerunner may wear prematurely due to high torque loads when removing the unit from the plastic cradle.
2,Not so hot,"If you're interested in this-- read the books from Christian McLaughlin, Robert Rodi and Doug Guinan before you read this. It's not very well written and the story isn't especially exciting... the others are much better examples of the ""gay beach novel"" genre..."
1,I simply cannot believe,that I finished this book. It took me weeks because I had to take a couple days off every few dozen pages simply to remind myself that the real world still exists.Why did I finish it then? Primarily because I could not believe that it would end on the planet Earth.
1,"""My Worst Date"" is one of my worst reads","My biggest problem with this book is that the characters are just not likable. I found it extremely hard to relate to any of these guys, and didn't find any of their lives extremely interesting. I would hope that not too many young people just coming out really expect life to be like this. Every guy in this book is a beautiful, musclebound man who hops in and out of bed with different partners. *Yawn* The subplot with the mother and son (just coming out... and also a fabulous stripper) dating the same guy seems either ripped off or an homage to Gordon Merrick. Either way, it doesn't really work. The guy they both lust after is a creep of the highest degree. If the quality of the writing on this book were perhaps a bit higher, this plot may have been pulled off. Instead, this is a lifeless, dull and rather unsexy book that has not inspired me to check out any other books by this writer."
3,Very Funny,I never really had any reason to visit Miami until I read this book. It's more of a travel-descriptive novel for me as I brought the book to guide me around the town (I left my Foddor's back home hehe). By the way what was so hot about the 11th Street beach?
1,"'Worst"" Says It All","I'm shocked by some of the praise reflected above and below for this extremely disappointing novel.The characters are wholly unbelievable, the plot strains for credibility from page 1, andworst of all-the dialogue is hopelessly dated. Teens use language that no '90s teen would ever use. ""Humpy?"" That sounds like mid-'70s gay queen (it's okay for me to say that, I'm gay!).This is a real downer of a book, all the way around."
1,The perfect description of what the world thinks of gays,"Reading this book was a difficult experience. Being gay I have expereicned the huge amount of narcisism that is prevelant in the gay community. This book is the embodiment of that and even pushes the envelope even further.The story to me is entirely unbelievable. A man that is having sex with his mother's boyfriend? A boy that strips at 17? That get's picked up by a relative at the club? Please...One chapter began with a sequence I had to read twice. It involved ctiricism of people that are fat -- ""fatties"" -- Ugh. It is literature like this that gives people the reason to think that gay people really are like this.Avoid this book -- unless you are interested in soft erotica."
4,Great song,"I love Low. It is one of my favorite of the Foo Fighters newer songs, and the rest of this disc is pretty cool too. Check it out. And try and catch the video for Low with Dave Grohl and Jack Black. Pretty funny stuff with them in drag.This song sounds a lot like a Queens of the Stone Age song, which happens to be one of my favorite bands and has been for awhile. If you like them, check this out. If you like both of those, check out the band Kyuss. You will not be disappointed."
4,Riches Within Your Reach!,"The book is very simplistic that anyone can follow, and the contents are quite enlightening. Robert Colliers books are so full of info that I can only handle a chapter at a time, or I miss something that sounds simple but is quite profound.Just dont buy it from [...] the cd download. You have to install their programs and you still dont have any control over your own file when done. It took me 2 hours to get it onto my MP3 and I had to download their software to do it. They support apple applications and I couldnt put it onto a CD because the program Itunes for apple wont load on my computer. Be safe, and buy the book."
5,Awesome!!,I have tried 8 of the recipes so far and all of them are great. I really like her refrigerator pastry. It is easy and tastes great.
4,Delicious treats,"This book is loaded with recipes for all kinds of baking, from hardtack to fancy layer cakes. It covers all the classics recipes from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Anyone familiar with baking from those countries will find thier favorites, and for those who are new to this region's baking plenty of delectable new discoveries are in store.Many recipes come with little stories and explanations about the traitions. The only thing I miss are photos, which make any cookbook even more tempting."
3,Recipes sound good,I was very interested in purchasing this cookbook but more than a little disappointed there were no photos to show what the end product should look like.
5,"A clear, concise, and informative book",This little book clearly describes the life cycle of a butterfly and what a garden needs to attract and retain butterflies. The descriptions of plants are brief but provide enough information for further research should one desire. The plants are organized by season which is very helpful. There is a nice butterfly identification section in the back of the book to round out the enjoyment of a garden. The author even lists some butterfly suppliers for those who want a head start on nature. This book is perfect for successfully planning and implementing a butterfly garden.
2,Very very basic book,"There are much better books on buttrerfly gardening out there than this one - I recommend Butterfly Gardening by the Xerces Society. Its got not only the plants that butterflies like but also the lifecycle of butterflies. Creating A Butterfly Garden is like the hummingbird gardening book by the same author - very very basic with listings of plants and drawings of gardens but little more. You can get what's offered in these books off the internet. I ended up spending a little more to get a decent book that got me further below the surface and have a great butterfly garden going - variety is the key. The more kinds of flowers, the more kinds of butterflies. Its important to recognize that to have butterflies you need to have caterpillars too and they are fun to provide for and watch develop as well"
3,basic,A good starter book but you can find more info by just looking on the web. It does have some good layouts for gardens but my issue was I wanted native plants and they don't tell you in this book if they're native or if they came from asia or elsewhere. I found other references that were far better but this is a start. Its just very basic.
3,creating a butterfly garden book,This is a great little book for the price you pay. It is small enough to through in your bag to read when you have wait times at appts. or easy to hold if your at lunch. You will enjoy the information you learn from this publication.
4,It's only entertainment... but I like it.,"It seems that all you have to do to enjoy a book by Eddings is turn your brain off. It's been some time since I read the Elenium, and I didn't have much expectations as it comes to this sequel, but yes, the man can still write. Some people here complain that the characters never encounter any real danger, but I don't see that as a bad thing. In fact, what I've been missing in many fantasy books is a certain sense of lightness. You can get tired of savage, breathtaking battles for the victory of the good. I mean, we all know the good _will_ win in the end! So why bite your fingernails off for nothing.Eddings is a humorous writer, of course, but his language is great and makes me laugh very often. Also he has a certain understanding of human nature. This is not great art, but surely there's worse fantasy writers around. I'll be very delighted to read the rest of Tamul."
2,Hmm,"What can i say, its a captivating story, it has humor. But i dont find the charakters welldone. The humor is in all the right places, AND all the wrong places, its everywhere. Because of this i got bloody tired of the book after reading half of it. And the humor never changes, therefor you dont get to experience feelings and emotions that are there. I cannot recomend this book. Thank you"
4,Still okay,Not as good as the Belgariad and the Malloreon and a bit less interesting then the Elenium. I guess there's not really so much more to tell about Sir Sparhawk and friends. Still the Tamuli is a worthwhile read and this first book is easy to get through. I still find myself laughing at the understated style of speech used and all the 'be nices'.
3,Could Be Better!,I have a feeling that this series will not match up to past favourites like the Belgariad or the Mallorean. His past efforts were filled with wonderfully magical characters which were surrounded by an even greater plot. Prophecy and dragons entailed all a surreal world were made of. I find the politics and characters of his latest novels too close to real life and I am thoroughly dissapointed by this.
2,Too much (supposedly) witty dialouge,"I really was looking forward to joining all the old characters from the Elenium and I brought this book the second it came onto the shelf. I was extremely dissapointed to find out that all the characters I had grown to love were gone. All replaced by a single person with a too sarcastic wit who was playing all of the main characters at the same time. There was never any tension in the story as it was always clear that our hero(s) would always outwit the stupid enemy while making fun of him at the same time. Sadly, I have not even considered picking up a David Eddings book since that day, and I would reccomend that if you like Eddings don't read this book; it may change your mind."
3,An Awesome Adventure,"I Thought that Domes of Fire was well written. The Characters in this book seemed real. Sparhawk was my favorite by far. He always had something cool to say, and he was tough. It left alot of room for the following books. One thing that I wished were done a little diffrently were the battles. They seemed so short. Just when they got started, they ended. All in all this was an awesome fantasy adventure."
2,"Same boring story, different land","The first book of tamuli, already when I checked out the cover I had the strangest feeling that this wasn't going to be a great reading experience, and I was right. The hero group meet a few new friendly people which are the dullest characters since.....They crack a few EXTREMELY lame ""jokes"". And so on and so on. I think this is the strongest book of the tamuli, it is quite thrilling when you don't know how strong the enemy is, but that feeling didn't last long. I can only recommend this book to the fanatic Eddings fans."
4,Nice Images....Old Fashioned,Inspiring pages with lots of creative clip art and images. Definitely not contemporary though. The pages are very old fashioned and antique looking. I personally think they are beautiful but if you are looking for something more modern then this isn't the scrapbook for you.I bought it as a gift for a friend and was a little disappointed by the images only because I know she is more in to more modern looking pages.
3,Not as expected,"I am very disappointed in the contents of this book. From the front cover, I was not expecting the images to be ""primitive"". Also, the cow image on the front cover is exactly as shown with the child on its back. There doesn't appear to be a way to get just the cow image only. There are some images like bows, flowers, butterflies and picture frames that I will be able to use for scrapbooking and card making. If it weren't for the non-baby images, I would feel like I wasted my money."
3,Maia Sharp - 'Hardly Glamour' (Ark 21) 3 1/2 stars,"Finally,a female singer/songwriter that isn't a Melissa Etheridge or Sheryl Crow sound-alike.This woman has her own identity.'Hardly Glamour' may be a bit laid back,but it's very indepth.Tunes such as ""Broken"",""Don't Come Around Tonight"" and ""Brownstone"" show us just what Sharp is capabale of.I'm not that big of a fan of this genre,but I thought this CD deserved a good mention.Somewhat recommmended."
3,A Thorough Presentation,"Edmonson has done us all a favor. This is a well written, tightly argued book on Calvin's view of Jesus Christ--first as Mediator, then as Prophet, Priest, and King. Many books have been written on Calvin and his theology. This is among the best! We are grateful for the author's pursuit of this topic and his fine work presented here."
2,outdated dino ideas for kids,"This is a poor resource for children who want to learn about dinosaurs, it gives outdated, incorrect information and illustrations to match. I had a copy of this book in elementary school and i kept it as a model of incorrect dino information."
1,Not a very good book,"At one point, (page 14) the book and the tape don't match. The book lists Apatosaurus and the narrator says Brontosaurus. Will NOT buy this line of books again."
1,Warners day off,"I am a huge fan of the old MGM musicals and have been more that happy with the restoration quality on every DVD transfer issued by Warners in the MGM library. The release of the ""Dream Factory"" collection is a fine example. These films could have been photographed yesterday (""Summer Stock"" is a pure delight to watch in terms of picture quality). ""Barkleys of B'way"" unfortnately does not live of to the exceptional quality acheived on other films of this genre.The DVD picture quality is very poor and dull and the sound is very muted. I was so dissappointed in this treatment. The DVD appears to have simply transfered the Video to DVD. No restoration to the picture is at all apparent. Even the trailer looks better than the movie.The extras are fine and I can't complain here but hey Warners, what were you thinking when you tackled this gem. Someone must have been taking a sickie!Sorry Fred and Ginger."
4,Really good Fred and Ginger,"This movie is the only color Fred and Ginger movie. It's really good, nice dancing, fun to see them older and in color. The dance ""I've Got Shoes With Wings On"" is really fun and amazing. Fred sure could dance. This isn't their best movie, it's my 5th favorite Fred and Ginger. I think ""Follow the Fleet"" is far more romantic, but if you're a Ginger and Fred fan, this is a must see. They made this movie after years of not working together. They were so good together, it's pretty funny, too."
1,disappointing,"Those looking for the beautiful melodies and light-hearted gaity of the earlier Astiare/Rogers films will be disappointed with this glum reunion. The two stars show their age, the music and dancing are sub-par, and the story is about as unromantic as you can get."
2,this is color??,I was sadly disappointed and should have heeded the warning left by one reviewer regarding the picture quality. This film looks as though someone colored it with magic markers in the most garish colors imaginable. However wonderful some of the dance routines might be--as noted by some of the better reviews here--I was too distracted by the poor quality of the picture to appreciate them. Sorry.
3,A Very Good Print of a Suprisingly Cheap Production,"We are great Fred & Ginger fans. We now have all their movies. Considering the Talent all around -- including Comden & Green on dialog -- we must conclude that this effort was limited by a very small budget. For example there is only one big, complete, musical, production number. The dialog is so limited, it forces the actors to be wooden. The color is great."
3,"Welcome back, ladies!!","The Slits are back w/ a 3-song teaser...1 punk tune & 2 rap-influenced tracks make this a nice return to the music scene after a loooooooooong hiatus. Paul Cook (ex-Sex Pistols) & Marco Pirroni (ex-Adam & The Ants; Chiefs O' Relief) contribute w/ drums & guitar, respectively. According to the anemic liner notes, The Slits' current lineup consists of Ari Up & Tessa Pollit, w/ Palmolive & Viv regrettably absent. Hopefully, this release is a small sign of things yet to come...More! More! More!"
4,Saw them live tonight. They did Kill Them With Love,"Marvelous live version. The band was happy and 6 piece with 2 original members. Delightful. A live sneak preview of this cd ep. A lively reggae, ok, more than reggae, nuttin' sleepy, that's for sure. I'd a bought the ep at the show but ran outta cash. They were all talking with anyone after the show and Ari brought her mom. I'll get this little item at some point."
2,Not Worth the Money,"If you're looking for high quality production, this isn't the video to buy. The audio is fuzzy and the editing is poor. They interrupt the train visuals with clips of animals and trucks that don't belong. It cuts from one scene to another, and back and forth from real trains to model trains. It also taught my 3 year old son how to crash his own model trains, which we aren't to thrilled with. However, HE enjoys watching it and finds it entertaining. I found ""Train Adventures for Kids"" a more informative and enjoyable video to watch."
1,Huge dissapointment due to poor reproduction,"Any wine connoiseur knows that a vintage wine is an authentic bottle of well preserved wine. In posters the word vintage can very well be a vanishing vista that cannotes something from the past. However, a very bad reproduction is a poor excuse to pretend that such classic posters be sold. Adding more insult is an enormous shipping and handling charge that adds $16 to a $3.99 purchase. As an accredited member of the Circus Historical Society I know very well what the originals look like. Furthermore, the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wisconsin have the original size authentic posters on hand."
2,Confusing,"***Possible spoilers***Probably the most confusing harlequin I've ever read. Neither character seem to know what they want, why they are doing what they are doing, and their emotions go from one extreme to the other in the span of a period. Christos started out making Alysia marry him for one reason, then seemed to do it for another and then changed, added in another reason all the while she's repeatedly told him she wouldn't have his babies and at one point towards the end he asks her how long she would have led him on before she told him that she was on bc and that she didn't want his baby...I like Jane Porter's book usually, but this seemed like she was writing two separate stories and accidentally mushed them together."
5,Another great story by Jane Porter,"Ms Porter presented Christos as a vulnerable but dignified hero. I loved him too! Alysia had her issues and they affected her, of course. But contrary to the hard, unyielding males of yesteryears, Christos was ready to listen and understand his wife. I liked the chemistry between them and I really admired the way he stood up to his mother for her. A hero one can desire for more than his wealth and physique."
2,A Romance Junkie,"This storyline was really great but it went flat fast. I liked Christo but I truly couldn't deal with Alysia and all of her crazy long winded thoughts. It went on for pages and pages. I was turning my kindle pages at the speed of light. She was a wimp, and couldn't face reality, her dad, Christos, the housekeeper, Christo's parents, her dead kid but she could have sex faster then a hooker by Bronx terminal market! I really didn't care for this book, I found it kind of dull."
4,"East and West. Readers Digest Condensed Book,Vol. 2, 1987",The book came in good shape for being that old. The price was more than reasonable. The story was filled with mixed emotions because of the culture clashes and the setting of World War II.
1,Don't bother,"This book is not sound. I found it full of conjecture which he calls in one place, ""The basic facts..."" Unedited, and not tightly written."
3,Shout out to the Babylon,"It's not often that you'll find reggae superstars paying tribute to the Babylon (slang term for the police), so this album is certainly unusual in at least that respect.There are a few stand-out performances by reggae luminaries like Aswad, who does a great version of ""Roxanne"", and Steel Pulse who perform ""Can't Stand Losing You"", but Maxi Priest doesn't do justice to ""Message in a Bottle"" at all. Sting also guests on two of the better songs, one with Ziggy Marley.As Police covers, there's nothing really different other than the reggae rhythms, except perhaps for ""Spirits in the Material World"" by Pato Banton and Sting, where Pato improvises a bit on the chorus.An interesting novelty album, and quite listenable, but does nothing to showcase or enhance the music of either The Police or the reggae artistes.Amanda Richards, Feb 2, 2005"
2,Not that great,"As a bonified fan of The Police, and a moderate fan of reggae, I was excited to hear old favorites redone by reggae artists. However, this album is surprisingly bland and unoriginal (aside from the fact that they're a bunch of Police covers--obviously, I didn't expect new lyrics). The arrangements were new to me but the sound was stale. How sad. Put your good money on ""Outlandos D'Americas,"" a tribute to the Police in Spanish: it's far better."
4,Police Business,"Although a bit hokey at some points (see ""Jamaican in New York""), this album rocks! Liking the Police is one thing, Regatta Mondatta takes it to the next level. The twisted and turned harmonics, along with lyrics which have been given an ""irie"" feel make this a welcome addition to any pop-reggae listeners."
2,Yougetit Forgetit,"If you like the Police ... and like good reggae .... you'll be disappointed in this album. Great artists, great tunes and alot of potential -- but falls way short in this overly commercial sounding tribute."
2,I have heard better!,"Unfortunately, I purchased this CD after the Spirits of the Material World tribute to the Police, so I was severely dissappointed. It doesn't hold a candle. I would recommend you listen to the songs before committing to spending money to own the album!"
3,a simple cd,"like reggae in new waves and new songs, well this cd of various artists is a good music paying tribute to the police."
4,I've played it so much some originals sound bland,"I love this album! I love Sting and the Police, and reggae: buy this if you do too!"
3,Christmas - Gary Lamb,This is an excellent CD but it is the same as Winter Dreams. The first song is titled Christmas but it comes up as Peace and Joy. The rest of the songs are the same as Winter Dreams. If you have one don't buy the other.I love Gary Lamb's work but this music doesn't sound a whole lot like Christmas. It is very relaxing but it is not very Xmasy!
5,Terrific Guitar Instrumental CD,"First, let me be candid. I've not really familiar with the originals that have been remade on this CD. Although I'd heard of the Shadows, I picked this up on an impulse when I saw the guitarists featured on it. If you're a Hank Marvin purist devotee, this may not be the most helpful review; but if you're someone who appreciates guitar solos with a bit more taste than the typical shredder b.s., this is a fantastic CD. Knopfler and Blackmore are particularly good here, as is Hank Marvin himself. Actually, there isn't a bad song on this compilation (a rare thing to say about any tribute album). It's not the kind ultra frenetic guitar slinging that leads to so many speeding tickets; rather it's more like the perfect background music for work or kicking back at the end of the day with the headphones on. Gutsy, melodic, and soulful stuff for anybody who digs the sound of a strat guitar"
2,A mixed blessing,"The only thing the tracks on this instrumental cd have in common is that they were all recorded by the Shadows at one time or another. Apart from two or three tracks (inlcuding the one by former Shadow, Hank Marvin), none of these recordings bears any resemblance to the Shadows sound and some seem distinctly half-hearted. The tracks do, though, present a wide variety of guitar styles including acoustic and electric."
5,¡Magníficos!,"Sole, Nacho y Juan Luis lo hicieron de nuevo. Después de 'Versióon Original' esperaba ansiosa su nuevo material y valio la pena la espera!! La voz de Sole, las letras y los arreglos se conjugan de una manera excepcional. Este CD retoma el estilo del grupo y nos permite disfrutar de composiciones muy frescas pero a la vez maduras y llenas de sentimiento. 'Gente' será, al igual que el resto de los CD's de Presuntos Imlicados uno de mis favoritos."
4,Garantia: PRESUNTOS,"Un disco que necesitas oirlo lentamente para asimilar la belleza de las letras, la inteligencia de las programaciones y la sinigual voz de Sole...quizas eliminaria un par de canciones como ""calor"" y ""dime que no"" cuyos sonidos y letras simplistas los encontramos diariamente en la radio en grupos comerciales...pero que se perdonan despues de escuchar ""gente"" ""alegria"" ""tu"" ""esta noche"" y ""la mujer que mueve al mundo"" ""me visitan canciones"" y ""parte de mi""Si quieres disfrutar la mejor voz en espanol y a los genios de la musica, definitivamente compra este disco."
4,Excellent,"Very good experience, quick delivery, item arrived as described, good price, overall no complaints and definately would do business again. Thank YOU!!"
4,cute,"just read this book last night...it's a very quick read, pretty short. anyway...this book is pretty cute, weyland sure is a likable character, and cat is your untypical regency character. the romance was slow to come which is nice...but i can't say i really liked how cat came onto him and not the other way around so much. also there was pretty much no sensuality in this novel, which was surprising. it would have been more fun with that ;) that's why i took away a star. ah, also the ending seemed really rushed..."
3,Not all that bad if you forget the details,"The story, once you get over the errors and the inaccuracies, is not all that bad. I found the relationship between Julian and Eliza touching and their friendship very real and down to earth. The first part of the book is quite enchanting.The relationship between Eliza and Marcus is odd to say the least. Why would a person who is so badly scarred emotionally and physically force a woman to marry him? Why resist her so much if he wants her that badly? Why does she agree to it all? What is the secret she is hiding?There are many things wrong with this book, but it does compel you to finish it! Despite the inaccuracies that will frustrate and irritate you... You still find yourself turning page after page, so... there must be something in it to merit a good rating!!"
2,Who wrote the second part of the book?,"This book was sectioned off into two parts. When you first meet Marcus, the hero, he's sweet and charming. Eliza, the heroine, is smart and independent. This story had potential.Enter the second part of the book..the Beast of Blackthorne. Marcus is a true beast in every way and Eliza is suddenly blindly dedicated to him, despite his ravings and rapings...I truly enjoyed the first part of this book and am disappointed it turned out to be so bad."
1,Poor; could have been so much better!,"As WMR-UK says in her review ""waste of a great premise!"" Besides the inaccuracies as stated in other reviews, there are unsolved mysteries here - the whole book seemed geared to fill us in so Johnston could lead to other books! No one even mentioned that ""Beau"" (Marcus) rapes Eliza twice - what kind of a hero is that? (Oh, I forgot we are calling that ""forced seduction"" now!) I was so thoroughly disappointed! It is rare that I am so repulsed by a book - but I was."
3,Just OK,"Not this author's best effort. I still don't see how anyone could fall for the hero after the way he treats the leading lady. First he ruins her socially, and then when she shows up to help him with his nieces he is downright cruel to her."
3,good,not sold any longer. was a good phone system but the batteries were very expensive. that is why I gave it a 3.
2,Battery life is very poor,"The features of the phone are nice. The sound is clear but none of this matters if the phone lasts 10 seconds before cutting out. Two of the three phones we purchased about a year ago have batteries that have recently failed. If you're interested in this phone, add $10-15 bucks per handset for the replacement batteries. Other than the batteries, the phone works fine."
4,Get a NiMH battery,"I agree with those who have had battery problems. I replaced all the original handset batteries with NiMH batteries about a year ago and haven't had any problems whatsoever since! I used Energizer ER-P511 batteries that I bought at the local Best Buy. Panasonic makes NiMH batteries for this phone now as well, but they are not included with the new phones. I highly recommend anyone with this phone switch batteries... major improvement!"
5,Great Phone !,"This is our third handset - we have them stationed throughoutthe house -Best portable phone we have ever hadMany ""easy"" functions -"
4,lost a star for high price,"I got one a couple of these with the main base unit a year or two ago with amex points. Everything's worked great, but I want to add a couple more handsets to the mix and they're damned expensive! $50 - $60 sounds like a lot more reasonable price for these. They're also hard to find. It seems like panasonic didn't make them for long, and newer handsets won't work with my base phone AFAIK. I also replaced the batteries with Energizers and they still work great."
1,short battery life,"good features but... after 1 year of use, batteries in 2 of these phones have extremely short life. Note that there is a class action suit pending against panasonic for this series of phones for this and other quality problems."
4,"Great phone, features; easy setup - battery life is poor","I bought a couple of these units to expand my KX-TG5100 base unit. Setup was a snap as was synchronizing phone books.The handsets are identical with the one that comes with the base unit. I've found the speakerphone on the handsets to be a great feature. I also love the simplicity of the interface.The batteries that come with the units out of the box are terrible and could not hold a charge after six months; however, I've found that the Energizer ER-P511 is a great replacement battery for the Panasonic P-P511 that comes out of the box, and is fairly cheap at anywhere between 10 and 20 bucks.As for the class action suit, most of the phones listed are Panasonic's 2.4GHz models in the KX-TG22 through KX-TG27 range; you've probably seen these phones stacked up in droves at Costco or Walmart. I've had my KX-TG5100 5.8GHz unit for almost two years and have never had any problems with interference, contact loss or keypad failure."
2,Disappointing,Pros: Looks cool.Cons: Window is low quality and milky. Case opens up by itself too easily. The belt clip fell off the first day I used it and my rhino skin and IPOD fell to the cement. Can't get the screw out of the clip to fix it although I don't know why I would try and fix it when I know it'll just break again.Don't buy one!
4,Actually 4 and a Half,"An excellent overview of the changing conditions of the Global Cities and a fresh look after her excellent book ""Global Cities"". Especially liked the essays about the concentration of power and wealth in cities like New York, London or Tokyo amid the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor.Essential fro everybody who's trying to understand the processes that have lead so many to oppose globablization trends the GATT and NAFTA agreements and others that keep changing the worl we live in"
2,Not enough Micro,"I bought this book to study the micro half... but there was only one test that was labeled micro, and the rest were mixed and seemed to be be mostly macroeconomics questions which was not the CLEP I was studying for so it was generally useless. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are taking both the micro and the macro and need to study for both at the same time."
3,not what I expected,There are bunch of Q & As. I was hoping to find a bit of information on the topics. This does not work for me or anyone looking for a brief intro to topics and the Q&As.
4,They are HUGE,I needed something to protect the wall in order to install a baby gate. They are huge lol. But they do the job. The only complaint I have is that I was having a hard time to get the paper off the stickers on the back to stick it to the wall. But I managed.
2,"Not a ""box set""","I only received the book, and no deck of cards. I am very disappointed that the cards did not come with. Although the book is in excellent condition."
5,A timeless Indian card book.,"This book has been around awhile, but needs no updates. No animal is bad just different characteristics."
5,enjoyed the book very much.,beautiful cards. Interesting book. had many dream of spirit animals after reading book.
4,fantastic pianio trio record,"This is a stunningly beautiful record from Marc Copland that draws heavily from the Coltrane catalog. As the title states it is a ballad record, and as such it maintains a fairly slow but steady pace. Don't let the pace fool you because this is not background music for a coffee shop or something to throw on at bed time although it would ceratinly be passable in both of those situations. I particularly enjoy the tunes so strongly associated with Coltrane (greensleeves, my favorite things, etc..) It's intersting to hear them done by a pianist like Copland, who owes much more to Bill Evans than Mccoy Tyner.Highly recommended album."
3,Screen part works but nothing else,"I give this screen three stars because the release mechanism broke after one use and when it was sent back to Amazon, the replacement they sent to me also failed in the same fashion, albeit after 15-20 uses. Kudos to Amazon in customer service but the problem with screens of this size is that they are so heavy, they put a rather large burden on the roll-up mechanism if left down for any lengthy period of time. As far as the picture is concerned, it produced terrific images from my Mitsubishi HD projector. Knowing what I know now, I feel that painting a screen onto a wall is a much better way to go."
3,Refreshing in its sincerity,I really wanted to like this book but aside from the overall message of rejecting the world and embracing the Truth this book was disappointing. The introduction and the first three chapters are worth reading but the majority of the book (pages 87-168) is spent recounting the lives of various people revered in Orthodox Christianity. In this section I feel the author could have used more input from others further along on the spiritual path than he was himself at the time. As a former devotee of the punk/hardcore/metal scene I was hoping more for an account of his personal journey rather than an attempt to expound the faith as he understands it. If your looking for an introduction to what the Orthodox believe I recommend The Orthodox Way by Bishop Kallistos Ware.
1,In The Dark,"Although the price was fair, there is little or no use for this product. I cannot help but feel foolish for buying it because so little information was provided about it. If you're looking for a book for a class, make sure that the edition as well as other pertinent information is given."
3,Just OK,"I love tracks 1 and 4, the others aren't so hot in my opinion. Ms Palmer can deliver the goods with her vocals, but her tracks need some better remixing."
4,Beginner Presser,"I'm so excited to find the flower press and think it's a revolutionary invention in the flower pressing sector. The only problem I have is determining the correct amount of time to microwave flowers. I wish there was a guide that gave you some more estimated times for flowers and more pointers to take some fo the guesswork out. I had some trouble with brown edges and color loss, but I will keep experimenting."
2,Nothing Like It in the World of Misconceptions,"An exciting read, but unfortunately so full of distracting and erroneous errors that it actually would have been better as an historical novel. The misrepresentations will probably lead to historians attempting to offset the errors in this work for years to come."
5,"Heroic, totally engsrossing","One of the great history sagas that I have ever read, and I have read alot of them. Ambrose is even better than my other favorite, Barbara Tuchman, about telling it how it is in the American history trenches. Without this great book the American public would have writen off one of the magnificent capitalistic, engineering, heroic mass labor miracles of the 19th Century. It's hard to believe what was accomplished even when one reads it. Wow!"
3,"Detail, Over-kill","I came away from this book having a lot more insight into the makings of the Transcontinental Railroad. Specifically, who the players were from top to bottom and the trials and tribulations that were encountered by both railroads.However, I do think that Ambrose got bogged down into too much trivia and redundancy in describing the individuals and the sequence of events. Because of this, I was quite glad when the book came to an end.This is my fourth Stephen Ambrose book, the previous three I would give high marks, with this one, I cannot."
2,At least he tried,"What saves this effort at all is the subject matter. The transcontinental railroad and its story is so grand that it is hard to screw it up. Stephen Ambrose has made a valiant effort but even with his great literary prowess he has proved unable to destroy the magic of the tale. Other reviewers have pointed out the repetitions, the errors, the plagarisms. I will point out just one strange one. On my copy of the book the rear cover prints reviews and raves for his Lewis and Clark book. At first glance you are prone to interpret it applying to this one. Mr. Ambrose, we still love you and know you can do better."
2,both a good and bad book.,"the Bad- it repeated itself too much,and could have benefitted from more depth and detail in both aspects of american history and railroading.the Good- very easy to read. this is probably a ""must-read"" book if you want just a good general overview of the genre. however, as both an american history and railroading fan, my expectations were not satisfied.4 stars for its merit as an overview for the genre; 0 stars for its merit as a ""deep"" book for the genre, so as an average it gets 2 stars."
3,A railroad,"This book was mediocre; maybe I expected more from this author based on previous works. Yes, the railroad was phenomenal, yes it was an engineering masterpiece with lively characters; but at times, it seems like these points are repeated over and over as statements .. not expanded upon. There are passages of description that are repeated in the text - as if the reader needed to be reminded. Obviously, Ambrose was totally enthralled with the concept of the transcontinental railroad - but sometimes - even in the case of miracles and wonders - less is more."
4,"After hundreds of pages, they did finish it","The author assembled innumerable sources and countless minutiae, helped by his whole family and probably many, many more. Then he repeats the mistake he made in previous books: He doesn't want to throw anything away, so he crams it into the book. But with too much material, and no selection, things get disorganized and repetitive. It is an interesting book, but not a good one. The maps are a disaster, as in his previous books. They are not detailed enough, and many important places are not shown. I am now waiting for the sequel, using up material he did not bring in this book - as this seems to be Mr. Ambrose's want."
3,"Not his best, but a good read.","Perfect, I would say, for 15 pages before each bedtime. Raliway fans should be forewarned, this is not about locomotives and rolling stock, it's about the politics, financing, logistics and sociology of executing an epic industrial project. Not quite as compelling as Ambrose's WWII books, or his Lewis and Clark tome, but I think that reflects the limitations of this subject matter as entertainment. I disagree with other reviewers who feel that he ""soft-pedaled"" the subjects of greed and corruption -- I got the message: there was plenty of both. I would applaud Mr. Ambrose instead for remaining relatively objective and non-judgemental in examining historical realities, and for not - as many authors often do - spinning the material into a commentary on current events."
4,A good read,"This is an excellent general overview of the transcontinental railroad, but will not satisfy the dedicated 19th-century history buff. An appetizer, not a main course dish."
3,Laying track is a lot like watching paint dry...,"This book tells an important story. The story however is basically about the repetitive process of laying mile after mile of track. The crooks who fleeced the American people to build the project are an unsavory lot. I'm a big fan of Mr. Ambrose and have read most of his work. Who can forget his brilliant ""D Day"". However, as pointed out by other readers, he totally lost me when he and his editors failed to note the error in respect to Antietam. It was Lee's orders wrapped around the cigars - as every school boy knows. Important subject but in the end it's just mile after mile of track. p.s. I was happy to know where ""Hell on Wgheels"" originated."
1,Pass on this,This was the first book I read on the Transcontinental Railroad. Even as a novice I could pick out errors. My edition placed Wells Nevada in the western part of the state. It's east. I tried to keep track of mileages of track laid. They didn't add up. Errors were so rife I actually wrote the publisher a letter. The writing style was so bad I got the feeling that the work was ghost written with Ambrose' name thrown on to give to work credence. When I read a newspaper article about a group of Sacramento rail historians who cataloged the books' errors I returned the book and got my money back.
4,good reading!,"easy reading, with lots of nitty gritty details - he tells even the politics that were being played out - many good pictures. I like how he keeps bringing in the events of the Civil War that were happening at the same time."
3,It is not easy being Ambrose,"It is not easy being Ambrose. He is held to a very high standard. His books on WWII are introducing whole new generations to the defining moment of our history. His skills go beyond WWII. His book on Lewis and Clark was amazing. If this book was by any other author everyone would love it, but compared to the rest of his collection this book is not the gold standard. Ambrose is famous for bringing life and emotion to history and this book falls a little short, almost as if his heart was not 100% into the subject. I enjoyed it, but was not blown away."
4,Must read for RR history buffs,"This is not particularly light reading, but is very interesting and gives many insights into American history from the mid- to late 1800's from the point of view of the men who built the transcontinental railroad."
2,Booorring!,"Being a big fan of Steven Ambrose, I was very disappointed with this work. He successfully turned a fascinating subject into a real sleeper. It helped me to bed on many occasions! Perhaps if he trimmed a hundred pages or so of the filler..."
3,Somewhat Confusing?,"I found this book difficult to read. It had a text book feeling. Many of the facts were wrong such as the Govenor of Arizona riding with other dignitaries to the ceremonies of May 10, 1869. Arizona did not become a state until 1912. Maybe he meant the Territorial Govenor? The Panama Canal being finished the same time as the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869? Overall, I enjoyed the story of the massive financial undertaking and incredible human labor involved. Inaccurate and confusing yes, especially the maps, but he brought to focus the inconeivable story of achievement for that time. Sun Lakes, Arizona"
5,Nothing Like It,"The story of one of America's finest accomplishments. A great study of the strengths and weaknesses of American capitalism. Another example of how it can be corrupted, but still gets great things done."
3,Building the Bones of a Super Power,"This was a fascinating book. Ambrose is outstanding in covering one of the most pivotal eras in U.S. history.It is hard to imagine the amount of speculation, wheeling and dealing, and blood that went into the building of the transcontinental railroad. Ambrose does a fine job opening up this part of history to anyone who can turn a page.Gripping book for anyone in the 5th grade and above."
3,This book gets stuck on the tracks,"The topic seemed very interesting to me and in the end I did learn a lot about the making of the Continental Railroad, how it came to be and the players involved. However, the writing style was really dry at times and the material yawn inspiring. Ambrose seems to throw as much filler in the book as he can.The characters were interesting but all the mundane info and rambling of stats and dead end sentences really watered them down. If you interested in Railroad history, American History, etc then this book will still serve a purpose but you very well might find it a grind to finish."
2,"There are much better, more thorough books on the subject","this is the first book i read by ambrose, and after 200 pages, i knew i wouldn't pick up another one. the research was shoddy and the prose was worse. often, ambrose will write two paragraphs in a row that say the same thing, and that sort of thing gets old fast. i recommend david bain's ""empire express"". it's much longer and more daunting, but it's an artful work of history that is much, much more rewarding."
2,a bad book,"I dont want to repeat what so many others have already said. This book seems to be a collection of all the 3 by 5 cards used in doing the research for it. There are many mistakes, repetitions and fillings. The story is interesting, but it is too poorly done. It would have made a good article for a magazine."
2,Disappointing,"This book by Mr. Ambrose seems rambling and repetitive. It could have been shortened if he had re-read the previous chapters and reminded himself what he wrote last week! He seems to be doing what the UP and CP barons were guilty of doing, making a longer book to exact bigger profits, like they were accused of trying to make the railroad longer to get more government money for it. Mr. Ambrose also has the irritating habit of confusing ""elevation"" with ""altitude"", though whoever drew the maps got it right. Still the book is an interesting starting point if one wants to pursue the subject in depth, or plan a vacation to Green River."
1,A Major Disappointment,"Mr. Ambrose - who generally writes as readable a history as anyone - fell way short on this one. At the outset, he admits that his publisher recommended this topic to him. I suspect his publisher needed an Ambrose book on the shelves for the summer of 2000 and magde this suggestion in May of the same year. The book was redundant and disorganized and gave the distinct impression of being thrown together like a midnight term paper. This book ought to be skipped."
3,Hard Going On The Rails,"I'll finish this because the information is valuable but it doesn't come alive as it should. Also the book is poorly edited, with many undramatic repetitions (Ambrose has already stated a dozen times that the builders' mentaily was just to ""nail"" the track down, and that any shoddy work could be fixed later, and I'm only 1/3 of the way into the story!). The effort is worthwhile as history but a plodding read due to lack of style and imagination. And I mean this as a sincere fan who will buy more of Ambrose' books as they come, but they should come slower. Take your time, next time, please!"
2,Could be much better,"Did anyone edit this book? There are whole pages that are repeated almost word for word throughout the book! I can't believe no one picked up on this.Otherwise, the books reads fast and is very informative about the subject."
2,Nothing Like This,"The effort is readable and entertaining, but in trying to tell the stories of both the financing and the construction of the road Ambrose muddles the logic of his analysis. While the construction was a technological masterpiece, the financing thereof was the sort often described by NBC News as ""The Fleecing of America."" The dismissal of prior analysis as ""post Depression Era political correctness"" in academia, is not substantiated by the evidence Ambrose himself provides. Also, the insert that it was McClellan's orders that were lost and read by Lee is exactly backwards, and appears to be one of those errors that should have been caught in the editing process."
1,Not What I Expected From America's Best Historian,"I am a Stephen Ambrose fan...read his biographies of Eisenhower and Nixon. Read his WWII books. I thought Undaunted Courage to Be the most remarkable book ever. This one however is not up to his standards. In fact, I would call it a disapointment. Passages exist that remind you that Ambrose is telling a story but they are too far apart. The account is redundant. The same anecdotes are repeated sometimes two and three times. I was left wanting to know more. He just did not do a good job. I thought the subject deserved a much better treatment. The work seems rushed and in some instances the information is wrong. There is a reference of Lee's Soldiers finding McClellan's plans for the Battle of Antietam when in fact just the opposite is the case.Greg Strauser St Louis"
3,Workmanlike,"Solid, if unspectacular, history of the drive to link the railroad line from the east to the one from the pacific. Several parts are interesting, such as the dangerous and hazardous conditions the men had to work under, the engineering accomplishments, and the different nationalities that came together to complete this monumental task. Ambrose also does a good job of pointing out how the railroad transformed the country. At times though, the text gets dull for me, especially when the telegrams and posts that say how much materiel was needed, what materiel was on the way, etc was shown word-for-word. I also feel that some of the stories behind the scenes on how the railroad was financed could have been fleshed out a bit more. A good book, but the complete story wasn't told."
2,Nothing Like It Before from Ambrose,I'll keep this short. This is not the typical Stephen Ambrose work. I had trouble even finishing it.
3,Good Historical Review,"The book is a good historical review of the building of the transcontinental railroad. The book is a little slow reading at times, since the ending was already known...yes they did finish the railroad. If one is interested in United States Railroading this is a must read."
1,MISTAKES,"THIS IS A SUBJECT I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH AND ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORS INTENT TO PRESENT THE HISTORY OF THE TRANSCONTINTAL RAILROAD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WORKING MAN IS GOOD, THE EXTREME NUMBER OF TECHNICAL AND HISTORIC MISTAKES MAKE THIS BOOK ALMOST WORTHLESS."
1,not only the tunnel makers were boring,"as a long time fan of stephen ambrose i looked forward eagerly to this book. what a disappointment. he constantly repeats himself from page to page, listing again and again the items carried by trains, the method of laying track, the size of the country - everything but a swift paced narration of one of the great feats of engineering. maybe ambrose should get back to interviewing servicemen and leave the writing of history to more qualified historians."
2,Disappointing,"A fan of Ambrose, I was disappointed in this book. Sure, the railroad was monumental and the personalities involved were strong, but I didn't have to be reminded of this every page or two. Ambrose's continual ""gee whiz, isn't this magnificent!"" attitude grew tiresome. Usually a more detached historian, Ambrose came up a little short with this one (though I recognize the standard he established with other works is awfully high)."
2,"Great subject, poorly edited and written","I have read about five or six Stephen Ambrose books enjoyed this one the least. I'm no expert in grammar, but the use of the word ""loan"" as a verb is unforgivable and used hundreds of times incorrectly. Where was the editor in the production of this book? We pay first class prices for these books and get a mediocre product. There were times also where he repeats the same story told in a previous chapter. Made me wonder at times if I had mismarked the spot where I had left off. I thought it was a fascinating subject covered in a slipshod fashion."
3,Chugs Like An Old Train,"This book is interesting but it doesn't have the ""movement"" like ""Undaunted Courage."" The slow but progressing movement of the CP and UP railroads and their quest to span the Nation with iron rails bogs down in detail as you read this book. The facts are interesting but bouncing back and forth between the railroad companies can be challenge for the reader. Having some knowledge of the tran-continental railroad and the westward movement is a big help in reading this book."
2,Looks like he missed the train,"This was Ambrose's first that I put down in the middle. Filled with repetition, lacking in color. And most sadly, the end left me hanging, wondering, wishing."
3,"Binding East to West, North to South","The building of the transcontinental railroad was one of the largest efforts in modern times. It tied the Atlantica to the Pacific and enabled the settlement of the west. It dramatically changed communication, reducing both time and cost. It began the healing of the rift between North and South.Ambrose tells the story of the building of the road, from initial concept through the decades following its completion. We learn of the complexity and scale -- grander than anything else to that time. We see the impact on the native peoples and the nation recovering from a devisive war.The story is worth telling, but is not the easiest read. There are so many details that for me they interfered with the story. Nevertheless, I learned a great deal, including the difficulties of each line, the effect on local economies and populations, the competition itself. The book is worth the effort."
1,Disappointed in a favorite a favorite writer,"Mr. Ambrose - who generally writes as readable a history as anyone - fell way short on this one. At the outset, he admits that his publisher recommended this topic to him. I suspect his publisher needed an Ambrose book on the shelves for the summer of 2000 and magde this suggestion in May of the same year. The book was redundant and disorganized and gave the distinct impression of being thrown together like a midnight term paper. This book ought to be skipped."
2,The Decline Continues,"It's sad to see that Ambrose, the author of such wonderful early biographies and histories, continues to churn out flawed and increasingly wooden material. He appears much more concerned these days with being President of 'Stephen Ambrose Inc.', than he is with writing solid history. If you're truly interested in the history of the Transcontinental Railroad, read David Bain's book instead. It may give you a few more details than you care to know, but the his passion for the work comes through almost as loudly as the passion (both good and nefarious) of the speculators and tycoons who lurked and paraded on the Transcontinental stage. In addition to several unforgiveable factual errors, Ambrose's work captures very little of the historical immensity of the this magnificent feat. Ambrose and his publisher are trying to sell words on paper based on the author's name. Hopefully he'll go back soon to writing insightful, compelling history that teaches as much as it entertains."
4,Good stuff for a train and history buff,"This was an easy read, since I skimmed over the financial data and repeated statistics. That said, I found the historical detail on the workers and how they worked fascinating. The Chinese were truly amazing in what they accomplished, and I developed a new respect for their culture. The men who built the railroad knew how to work hard. Ambrose's view that the railroad truly was the greatest change in man's history is a valid one, and made me consider how amazingly fast our world has changed since then.I was left wanting to drive I-80 and see the original transcon route and visit Promentory Point. The bibliography is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn more. Enjoy."
3,Interesting but not Ambrose's best.,"I enjoyed the book and the repititions did not bother me. In fact, they seemed to add to it as mile after mile of problems for the builders rolled by. While I did develop a certain sympathy for the founders and the financial risks they assumed, I felt they had a little too much of the ""kid-glove"" treatment."" I would like to have seen a little more even-handed approach. As other reviewers have mentioned, a time line would have been helpful. And just where in blue blazes is Humboldt Wells? It is reffered to many times but is not on any map. Wells is on the map of Nevada but not Humboldt Wells. Also just who lost ""Order No. 191? As far as I know, Corporal Barton Mitchell who found it was a Union soldier. thus it must have been a Confederate trooper that lost it. Were there other orders? This is a big time error that should have been caught. It was a good read but not as good as ""Undaunted Courage"""
3,Could have been so much better,"While the material in the book was interesting, it had some serious problems in presentation. While the project was no doubt a success, there is surprisingly little detail supporting this in the book. It needs a lot more maps, and with more detail, such as topography. It's tough to appreciate in one's head what it is like to cut a tunnel without knowing the steepness of the mountain. He repeats himself incredibly frequently, which wears on the reader after 100 or so pages. The story is no doubt historically significant, and having some prior knowledge of the subject, I was fascinated at this look at one of the biggest projects to combine free market forces with government funds. But to a reader new to the subject, the poor presentation is liable to leave too many important questions unanswered, and too many headaches rom the repetitions."
2,Ambrose out of his element,"Stephen Ambrose has a great talent in getting to the ""crux"" of matters relating to history - providing an overall view of the strategy behind goals while providing a realistic and gritty view of the actions of average people making the strategy into reality. I have read most of his books on WWII and ""Undaunted Courage"". In this (Railroad) book, he doesn't seem to feel the same affinity for the average people that he has shown in his previous works. It's as if he read the Cliff Notes and wrote a book based on the notes. No true feeling for the work and iniative of the nameless folk (read the actual workers - Irish and Chinamen) comes through. He does a fair job on describing the few men with the true vision, but overall the work lacks heart."
1,What a Disappointment!,"Ambrose was clearly uninterested in his subject. This is a disjointed, poorly written book. One would guess it was a student's first term paper if one did not know that Stephen Ambrose is an acclaimed author. The maps are simple and poorly placed. Under Ambrose's pen, the story is dull. Some sections appear to come straight out of the other recent railroad book, The Empire Express."
1,Disappointment,I wish I had read these reviews before asking Santa to put Ambrose's book in my stocking. The glaring errors contained therein spoiled my anticipated enjoyment. The Humboldt River arising in northeastern Utah?! McClellan's orders before Antietam known to Lee?! (Would that the latter had been the case for this Johnny Reb.) The readers are owed an apology by both author and publisher.
3,Not his best,"I have read many of Stephen Ambrose's books and have liked them. This one, however, is not his best. He frequently repeats himself. I even found one paragraph repeated verbatim. While he has some interesting insights, the book seemed much more superficial than his others such as Undaunted Courage."
1,More than you would like to know,"It would seem that Mr. Ambrose:1. Needed to satisfy his publisher2. Needed money (doubtful)3. Had nothing better to do (could be)4. Wrote this book on several different occasions, and then quickly compiled it (highly likely)5. Wanted to bore us and re-bore us as to how many cottonwood ties and spikes could be shipped out and re-shipped out to the end of track.I'm a big railfan, and was expecting to devour this book. As a matter of fact, I read it while traveling on the Empire Builder from Chicago to Seattle and back. While hoping for a good read on my journey, I ended up feeling that I was being subjected to such minutia and endless repetition that I questioned every flip of the page. Should I flip again, I asked myself over and over.Stephen did some great things in his time.This wasn't one of them.Frank"
3,Failed to pass the test,"As a fan of Ambrose, and his great books such as Undaunted Courage, I was certainly disappointed in this one. The story was good, but a lot of facts and explanations were missing. The maps were elementary. Why wasn't there a time-line map shown? The map on page 343 belonged back in Chapter 7 or 9, probably the latter. He writes of so many places that never show up on any map. Lots of items/tools/equipment are never really explained. He indicated that some Confederates worked the line, but never indicated how they got along with the many Yankees. I liked the back and forth chapters which kept both the CP and the UP together time-wise, but many improvements could have been in this book. It isn't Ambrose's best by a long ways!"
2,Boring and repetitive,"As a fan of Stephen Ambrose, this work was a great disappointment for me. The biggest complaint is that the story was so repetitive. The same facts, over and over. In chapter after chapter, he remarks on the number of rails laid, the number of spikes driven, the number of fills made, the tunnels dug, and so on. I think much more life would have been given to the story if more personal accounts and incidents of the workers had been expanded upon. No doubt it was a great undertaking, but more should have been written about the common man doing the work. Additionally, more maps and photos should have been included which would have given the reader a better view than just the endless list of facts and figures. Ambrose really missed it on this one."
1,Does not live up to the standard of Ambrose's earlier work,"This book reads like a rush job - it seems to have been thrown together in a hurry with sloppy fact-checking and editing. There are numerous errors where characters and place names, mountain ranges, and rivers are mis-identified. Several passages are repeated two or three times in different places as though the author overused cut-and-paste to flesh out his story. The time line is extremely difficult to follow and is in some places contradictory. It provides a very unsatisfying read.This is my fourth Ambrose book and it is not in the same league as the others, woefully not even close. As a here-to-fore fan of this author's work, I am greatly disappointed in this effort. If you are looking for a cohesive, clear, and consistent history of the transcontinental railroad, look elsewhere. If you are looking for the best of Ambrose, try anything else."
5,Nothing Like it in All the World,I really enjoyed this book. It is well written and if you are in interested in American History it gives you insight into the period of history surrounding the building of these two powerful railroads. It also gives you an inside look at the dealings and graft that went into the building of the Transcontinental Railroad. I would recommend this book and actually already have.
1,above avarage,This is the best account of how the Union Pacific Rail Road came to be.It is the first time I have read about how Brigham Young and his people helped out. It is also the first time anyone mentioned the Oregon Shortline Rail Road through the Columbia Gorge as being the best route. I live near the U P mainline in Pendleton Oregon and I am a hopeless train watcher. I liked this book a bunch.
1,HAS AUTHOR HEARD OF CANADA!,"Pierre Berton, a Canadian author, born in the Yukon, wrote a similar book several years ago about the construction of the CANADIAN TRANS CONTINENTAL RAILWAY. It's existence makes the claim of uniqueness of the U.S. achievement a joke!"
2,Too bad.,"Ambrose usually writes such great books. This is the exception. His ""facts"" are not always so. They bothered me so much that I had to force myself to finish the book. Better luck next time, Mr. Ambrose."
2,Choose another book,"As a history and railroad buff, I found this book very disappointing. Ambrose takes the bombastic approach to history and infers that anything American has to be the best. For example, in the Introduction he says that this project far surpasses the building of the Canadian Pacific and the Trans Siberian. Even though these railways were two and three times the size, through tougher terrain and with climates that make US seem a tropical paradise. Somewhere out there there has to be a book that takes a deeper look at this exciting period of history."
5,A good historical account of the Transcontinental railroad,"This Book is simply amazing. Once I picked it up I could not put it down. I read the whole thing in three days but would have finished it sooner if not for work and college classes. As a history minor in college I have read some really boring stuff, but as usual Ambrose pulls you in from page one. Some of the more important facts are repeated often so they really hit home. All in all this is one of the best books I have read about the Transcontinental railroad and I would recommend it to anyone with a passion for history. It details everything from the money men to the hard working Irish, Mormans, and Chinese and the horrid conditions they worked in. It is a great book to use as source material for reports for those of you in high school or collage and in fact is just great for reading period."
3,Hokey! I rushed to return the book. I thought I would gag.,"And then Abraham Lincoln stretched out his long leg. . . And then President Lincoln stretched out his long arm. . . The Irish were this way. . . The Chinese were that way. . . Dreadfully boring. . . . Absolutely popular history. . . The first of Ambrose's books I've attempted and probably the last. . . Hokey, hokey, hokey!!"
1,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","I generally enjoyed this book until I read that McClellan found Lee's orders before Antietam. The reverse is true. Then I found alisting of the numerous errors.For example: Page 69, paragraph 1:“[Theodore D.] Judah, the man who built the suspension bridge at Niagara Falls”Theodore D. Judah was the Chief Engineer of the Niagara Gorge railroad which ran from Niagara Falls to Lewiston. The Niagara falls suspension bridge was designed and built in 1853 by John A. Roebling, who later built the Brooklyn Bridge.-----------In the book Empire Express : Building the First Transcontinental Railroad by David Haward Bain, it is stated that Judah left the area without even meeting the designer of the bridge, much less building it."
2,Historical Reference by glance,"How could (on page 292), the author state that Lee discovered McClellen's order of battle prior to Antietem. The opposite was true; wrapped in three cigars found by a union seargent. It was disregarded by Pinkerton and McClennan.If this obvious ""brush over"" of facts cast questions on other facts withing this book. I used to think the Ambrose was too careful for that."
3,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. While it is most likely historically accurate I found this subject extremely dry. Parts were very intersting but I was expecting more about how the Irish and Chinese actually built the railroad. If you're into trains this book is for you; However, it took me longer to read this book than it took to build the railroad. Sorry Mr. Ambrose I'm a total fan but this just didn't work for me."
2,What a disappointment,"After ""Undaunted Courage,"" I was anxious to read Ambrose's account of the Transcontinental Railroad. While the last chapter was compelling, the rest of the book suffered from poor editing. I have to question the author's strategy of separating the stories of each railroad into alternating chapters. Yes, many personalities and grand geography made for a complex history. But retelling in this ""back and forth"" format creates to much repetition of detail."
3,A narrative (but not a history),"Ambrose states up front that he is only going to tell the story of how the Pacific railroad was built without any form of analysis and he does exactly that.The storytelling technique is quite choppy. The author attempts to tell the stories of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific at the same time, in the same manner that the railroad was built, but this sometimes leaves the reader dizzy.Better editing would have helped this book. There are some regrettable errors and typos. More of the sites mentioned in the text should have been included on the maps, which could have been presented in a more logical order."
2,Great story...bungled by a hurried author or editor,"Ambrose is excellent, and this story is fertile ground. But my take was that the book was just a published assembly of his 3X5 research cards with a handsome dust jacket. He has good moments, but it needed editing badly especially near the end. Such a shame to miss the compelling story of this feat, by publishing a rough draft."
2,what missed here?,"i have to say that i was really disappointed with this book. its a natural fantastic story, with all the ingredients anyone would want, but ambrose, seems to have blown through this manuscript in about 3 weeks. it jumps all over the place, is incredibly difficult to follow sometimes and loses considerable punch with his casual use of prose. i have to be honest - this is the first ambrose book i have read, so i can't tell whether he simply had a bad month. i hope so. but this book is just not a very good read, which, given the subject matter, is too damn bad."
2,Two thumbs down,"This book must rank among Ambrose's worst. It is confusing, redundant, overwritten, jingoistic and mind-numbingly dull. If any reader can decipher the Union Pacific Railroad's finances based on Ambrose's exposition, then he or she should get a Nobel Prize in economics."
2,Ambrose needs a good editor,"It's interesting to read, but woefully repetitious in spots. Technically, Ambrose seems totally unfamiliar with his subject. I got the feeling he is neither a railroad buff nor mechanically inclined, for some of his descriptions of technical and mechanical aspects of the construction were pretty haphazard.In general, I enjoyed reading it, but I wasn't impressed by the quality of writing, and I'm not at all sure of the reliability of its information."
2,Tedious transcontinental tale,"This is a story about two companies building a railroad line between Sacramento, California and Omaha, Nebraska. While the workers are fighting Indians and blowing holes in granite and each other, the owners are scalping the country of millions. There is a great story here somewhere, but Stephen Ambrose has missed it completely."
1,tragic,"A mind is a terrible thing to waste. As a young man, Ambrose gave us beautifully written books of intellectual substance. Now he gives us bestsellers, but they are shallow, facile, poorly researched work that panders to the public taste for simple stories simply told. He could have been a great historian and left a mark on his era."
2,over rated,"Ambrose has become so popular he thinks he can write anything. The best book on the transcontinental railroad is called 'Empire Express'. This book is just not worth it. Ambrose has produced some valuable scholarship(on Ike and Nixon) but this doesnt pass muster.Not recommended when equal and better volumes exist that are specialities for the authors involved, not just popular history."
3,Not a classic but a good read just the same.,"Enjoyable, but somewhat repetitive story of the transcontinental railroad. Often narrative gives out and is replaced with lists of statistics or simply fails and is reduced to hyperbolae.Despite this, it was a good telling of the facsinating story behind the train that tied together the american continent. T"
2,watch band cannot be replaced!!,"Very disappointed that no where in the description is there anything about the fact that the watch bandis ""married"" to this watch and cannot be replaced!! The clasp is hard to work, and I would have preferreda stretch band had I known all of this! Now I wasted $100+. Would have kept looking had I seen a review like this one. Hope this helps someone out."
4,Nice color of Gold,"So far it keeps very good time, The shade of Gold is very nice. The watch band is large, I am going to take to a jewler & have some links removed."
3,For the die-hard RH fan only,"Before I get flamed to oblivion, let me make it clear: I'm a huge Radiohead fan. OK Computer and the Bends are my two favorite CDs, and I bought Itch to complete my collection.And its decent. There are a number of good songs on the CD, notably Vegetable and You. But its mainly a collection of B-Sides from RH's Pablo Honey days, before the band hit their stride with The Bends. If you're an obsessive fan that wants everything, you'll find tracks here you can't get anywhere else, but for the average listener its a mediocre experience not worth the high price."
3,a bit expensive but worth it for the RH fan,"This EP import was originally released in Japan after the release of Pablo Honey. It's all unreleased in the USA. It includes Stop Whispering(US version), Thinking About You(fast version), Faithless The Wonder Boy, Banano Co., Killer Cars(live), Vegetable(live),You(live), and a acoustic version of Creep with just Thom. A real gem in your RH collection, but probrably a waste for the people who only like RH's big hits. Live songs are all good and the b-sides are so-so."
4,Great CD! Try it out! It's sure to be a hit!,Wow! Great CD! Any DC Talk fans- its a must! I really enjoyed this CD because it has all my favorite hits from my favorite artists combined into one! I have to disagree with one of the other reviewers- Kevins Birthday Song is a hit!
1,The most expensive piece of junk I ever bought....,Poor quality. Will keep it ONLY because it weighs a little less than the Titanic and shipping would kill me.
2,Chaise Lounge,"This product is far below standads, I'm glad trhat I did not pay fullprice for these units I purchased two lounges and had to some fit-its to both."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"I own this movie on Beta, its pretty good for a movie i had never heard of, some good action. Not much violence, lots of running. I do recommend it for an older action movie though."
2,"""The Good"" with ""The Bad""","It is a good thing that these two movies are being sold together otherwise the movie ""Absolute Zero"" would rarely get sold. I had never seen this disaster movie before. The characters in this movie are so unbelieveable that you lose interest. The scientist are so uninteresting that they are boring. No explanation of the pending disaster which is going to occur. Which, by the way, is a shift of the poles, causing an ice age in the southern part of the US. Very little science in this movie and even less acting.""Volcano in New York"" is a good disaster, science fiction, movie. Truthfully, I've seen it several times and would not hesitate to watch it again. Good science, good acting and it's never boring. Very believeable. Good story."
3,"Does the job, but not outstanding","I am just starting the text, and though it seems to contain all I need, I get the feeling that about 30% of the words read are unnecessary. There is way too much friendly talk to make the transition for non-technical users as well as repetition, and unnecessary praising of the program."
1,I thought I rented a horror movie not a horrible movie!,This was just terrible. Just terrible. I usually like everything. Low budget movies aren't always bad but this was. This must have been written by a child. Not just any child but a slow one at that. The kids in this movie just didnt even try. I never wanted kids to die so bad. There's basically no dialogue. Just slow sleepy music and even slower kids going nowhere. Spoiler alert! The ending is just ridiculous. They turn into mermaids! What? For real? And theres a giant octopus! What? Don't waste your money or your time. Please! I beg you don't watch this movie.
1,Zero stars. Biggest waste of my time.,"If amazon gave refunds because a movie sucked, this would be #1 in line. We went in expecting a zombie flick. What we got was... I don't even know.It starts off with an interesting premise. People get infected from an airborne virus, and there's a few group of kids that are immune. They use way too many flashbacks to tell a semi-interesting story, while the current time story is ridiculously boring. It's filled with horrible acting, horrible cinematography, horrible graphics, and the worst screenplay ever. Be ready to be put to sleep by a zombie movie....oh and if you're actually awake at the end... the ending is so comical, it'll just blow your mind away... and not in a good way.so, amazon, when you read this, please refund me my $3.99. Thanks."
4,Fabulous voice,"To compare Pasión Vega's voice to Norah Jones is unfair to Vega (Vega has more body and more ""uumph""). Vega's voice boasts incredible control and she sings with an ease that is a delight to listen to because it's also melifluous, full and solid. She can be forceful, soft, melancholic, happy. As this CD is the first that I know of her, For me personally, this combination of songs is a bit too mainstream pop/ballad sounding. I would like to hear her do something with more flamenco flavor (evidently she has sung flamenco), or some fusion with jazz. Many of the songs have predictable melodies and they leave me yearning for something more creative. A few of the songs very much remind me of the old duo Sergio y Estibaliz (whom I enjoy). Anybody remember them!?All in all, to use a hackneyed phrase I rarely am moved to write: Vega sings like a bird. The CD is worth it just to enjoy her vocal excellence."
3,Just about okay,"I got this after listening to ""Rotterdam"" which is still my favourite song in this album. I liked ""Don't Marry her"" , ""Little Blue"" and ""Liars Bar"", but the other songs somehow didn't impress me very much. I had decided that the group is good, but not good enough to tempt me to buy another of their albums. But after reading the other reviews, I guess I'll buy Quench - maybe that will improve my opinion about the group."
4,"Perhaps not their best, but very good nonetheless","There were only two major hits off the album, namely ""Don't Marry Her"" and ""Rotterdam (Or Anywhere)"". The rest is surprisingly good, with tracks like ""Little Blue"", ""Artificial Flowers"" and the witty and dark ""Liar's Bar"" really make this a worthwhile buy. However, overall this is not as good an effort as what their previous work is - a little melodramatic sometimes, perhaps there are too many ballads. On the other hand, production is excellent, and really makes your sound system come alive. Go and get it if you're already a fan.If you are new to the band, then this may just not be the best place to begin. I would definitely get their best of compilation ""Carry On Up The Charts"" first. Alternatively, check out some of their earlier releases, such as ""0898""."
3,"Good stuff, but definitely not their best","I love the Beautiful South to death, but this is not a good introduction to their music. There are too many ballads, and not enough musical variety. ""Little Blue,"" ""Rotterdam"" and ""The Sound of North America"" are the highlights here. To get a better idea of how great this band can be, get ""0898"" or ""Quench."" This particular disc shows off the band's sarcastic lyrics and perfect pop touch, but a lot of it sounds too forced. Not bad, but please start with something else if you're a BS newbie."
4,Great in parts...,"For the most part a good album with a blues/folk feel and some rather angry and cynical lyrics.The best known songs here are the saucy `Don' Marry Her' and the social commentary - `Rotterdam'. There are several songs about social ills from the mind and emotions of the afflicted, exploring themes from the mind of a prostitute - `Mirror', an alcoholic-`Liar's Bar', the homeless - `The Sound of North America', the lonely -'Alone', the abandoned orphan - `Artificial Flowers' and others. These are sometimes good, sometimes too melancholy , cynical and bitter. My favourite songs on this CD are `Rotterdam', `Mirror', `Foundations, and `Have Fun' all fantastic pieces that I can listen to over.But there are other parts that bogged down however."
4,Problems Setting Up KX-TG5100M,"If you experience low volume with the handset, it may pay to call Panasonic Tech Support because if you switch the line mode from ""B"" to ""A"" and do a complete recharge of the handset battery, you can improve the volume. I thought there was a defect with my first unit and I returned it for another unit which still had low volume on the handset despite all attempts to increase it. But after switching the line mode and doing a second complete handset battery recharge the volume has improved but still a little faint. It also seems very faint when operating my wireless and cable PC's and TV in my home office, despite operating at 5.8GHZ."
1,battery problem??,I am very unhappy with this panasonic model as well. The battery never gets fully charged even though the indicator says someting different. The phone keeps indicating tobe placed near the base even when it is like a hairline of a distance away. This phone can die on you and I have changed the batteries for both my handsets 2 times in the last 8 months! I would never recommend it.
3,"Nice phone, crappy battery","I really like my phone. I added a 2nd handset unit to house and it works great. Like most people that wrote a review on this phone, the only thing that bothered me was the battery life. I had to buy another battery and that's $25 that didn't have to be spent in a little bit over a year of use."
2,Some Good Features but Flawed in Critical Functions,"This phone does have some good features that others have mentioned - excellent speakerphones in handsets, etc but is flawed in 2 critical functions. First, the volume is too low. Do not expect to use this phone with moderate background noise, e.g. with a fan running, or sizzling food cooking. IMHO, all phones should have a max volume that exceeds what you need in a quiet environment. Second, the answering machine sound quality is barely satisfactory. My old 900mhz Panasonic machine had better volume, better answer machine sound quality and more features, like the ability to page me, which this machine cannot do. Third, the interface for the answering machine is clunky. Why such problems and dropped features in a phone this expensive? Who cares about the rest of the features if you can't hear your conversations?"
3,Volume could be louder,The highest volume level isn't very loud. I also wish it were a lot easier to press the keys on the base. This phone seems to have a lot of features but these 1st 2 issues are making me think I might return this phone and try again.
2,Lousy phone,"The sound quality is HORRIBLE. Whenever the other party speaks, there is faint white noise in the background. Don't waste your money. Panasonic used to make good phones, but this one is a piece of junk."
5,"awesome, full-featured phone","(also read the reviews for kx-tg5110m which is the same phone with a second handset in the box.)i am extremely satisfied with this phone. it does not interfere with my 802.11b network which i have set to channel 6. the 2.4GHz phones kill the network.this phone has almost every feature imaginable as has been described in the other reviews. there's only one major feature that is left out: you can't move or copy a message from one mailbox to another. this would be nice if a message got left in the main mailbox but i wanted to move it to my wife's mailbox and turn her ""new message"" indicator on.the sound quality is excellent.i highly recommend this phone. don't forget to buy additional handsets because the inter-handset features (like intercom) are very cool."
3,Good phone but deteriorating battery life,This phone is packed with features. The only problem I faced was the battery life. The life of the battery started deteriorating 4 months after the purchase. I had to change it after 6 months as it would not last for more than 15 minutes. I thought that I was the only one with this problem and that turned out to be incorrect. My colleagues and relatives who bought the same phone had battery issues too.
3,Almost a great phone,"This phone has some really nice features - speakerphone in the handset, caller ID on each handset and the ability to transfer the telephone book between all handsets.But there is one glaring problem which caused me to return it for a refund: The volume on the handsets is just way too low for any environment with any ambient noise. Even with the TV on low volume it is not that easy to hear. Panasonic tech support was prompt and polite, but the problem was not solved.I do not expect such a simple flaw with such an expensive telephone system. It is not acceptable."
2,Poor Battery Life,"I had the same problem as another reviewer. After less than a year the handset batteries will not hold a charge. If it wasn't for the expected yearly battery expense ($10 each), I would have rated this a 5-star phone system. I have four phones purchesed within a few months and all of them, one-by-one ended up with the same problem. I bought new batteries and hope not to, but I expect to have to replace them again in 8-12 months."
1,defects,"I bought the base station and two handsets -- they worked great for less than a year ... now the batteries go dead after less than an hour of use, or lose contact with the base station from the next room. Very disappointing for the amount of money paid."
2,Very dissapointed,"I bought this phone right when it came out (one base station and a second handset). Within a few weeks, the phone LCD when bad. It completely stopped working.So I contacted Panasonic's support to get it replaced. What a hassle!! I have to pay to ship the phone back for them to repair it! Just terrible. When my phone is finally returned, the LCD goes out again within the week. Needless to say I am very dissapointed at this point.So I call their support and complain. This time they send me a shipping label so I don't have to pay for it again. Well, after waiting two weeks, I had to call them again to remind them to send me the label - which they did that time.Well, now my phone has been gone for over a month with no word from Panasonic. I am waiting on the phone (about 45 minutes now) as I type this to speak with someone about the status of my phone.Panasonic generally makes good products. But if you run into a problem, you are basicaly screwed."
1,Do No Buy,"This phone died after just two months. When I say died, I mean died - error read ""System Error #1"" and all lights on base were flashing. Called Panasonic, waited about 10min, and was told (as someone else said below) it probably was a power surge (doubtful - if it was it didn't affect anything else). Sent it back to Panasonic, and was told that I would be sent a refurbished/rebuilt unit, not a new one (wrong answer!).Other than the dying, and poor customer service, the phone is great - excellent features and great reception. Maybe I just got a lemon."
2,Battery life - issues,"I've had this phone for nearly a year now, it has been hardly used, 3 hours per week the most and the battery died on both units. I will have to replace the batteries since it is not usable at all."
3,Good for it's day,"I have had this phone since it was released, but late to review. The sound quality is good, but I never figured out how to locate handset when lost. I do not know if the machine was defective or I did not read the instructions. I am on this intuitive kick. Having common sense I believe that I should be able to use most products without a lenthy explanation. This phone did not provide that for me, but o.k. never the less."
2,third time i buy it,i buy this telephone with 6 optional phones to all my rooms but is the third time i have to buy the main phone base because it only last aproximately 2 1/2 years and because of the investment i have in the 6 phones i have to be buying the main base again and again.
1,Waste of money.,Although Norman Leff has superior talents writing is not one of them. The writing is ponderous and the photographs are useless. There is nothing to be gained by purchasing or reading this book. Save your money and buy something else.
1,"If he can catch you, you deserve to lose :-)",Save your money and buy the fighters notebook instead.My copy of Norms book will be going up for sale on ebay in the near future. I expect shipping will be more than the the final bid price. JMHO.
1,This book [is bad]!,"This book is worthless. First, they don't tell you that what release of Solidworks this book covers until you find out for yoruself when you crack open the cover. Guess what? It's for a version of Solidworks that's three years old and there isn't an update version of the book available! Secondly, the step by step lessons totally [are bad]. Very poorly written and illustrated."
3,An excellent companion book to the Solidworks user's guide.,"The only disappointment to the book was that it didn't show enough example excerise. The given examples were easier to follow than the user's guide from Solidworks. In order to use this book efficiently though, you still have to know the the basics from the Solidworks user's guide. This book didn't show any hardcore design examples an engineer might face in the 'real' world. I would only recommend this book to novice user Solidworks."
5,Works wonders,"I've been using this cream for 3 years. It has made a huge difference, and I get compliments on my skin a lot. I highly recommend it, as I've tried other products for my face, and this has proven to be perfect for me. It has no irritants, is not sticky or filmy, and feels like it absorbs into the skin better than other products. Also helps that there is no fragrance. Use it in the morning and lightly before sleep every day, after cleansing. You will be very happy with the results."
3,Mmmmm,"I have used this product for a number of years, on recommendation & have loved it; however the recent purchase I have made smells very odd- almost like petroleum! It's definitely made me think twice about buying it again- certainly over the internet."
2,Nothing special,I'm 22 yrs old and a beauty consultant at Ulta recommended I try this for my dry acne prone skin. I've been using this for a month now and I don't think its anything special. It's just really expensive. I can get a similar product using Purpose's SPF moisturizer at CVS.
5,Love this product,Both my boyfriend & I use this it gives such a nice smooth finish and is the only thing he finds that keeps his skin from peeling
5,Fantastic!,"I have combination skin and break out very easily. This cream has been fantastic. It has a faint and pleasing scent, moisturizes the dry spots and doesn't leave the more oily spots any worse. I use it in the morning and night. It's light enough to wear under make-up and thus far (I've been using this for over 2 months now) has not caused any breakouts. In fact, my skin is smoother and more supple. I highly recommend this cream."
5,Great Price!,This is a great product and price is great compared to what I'm used to paying for it at Dermalogica.
5,Great product,I have used this product for a long time now but found it is cheaper here on Amazon!!!
1,Own This Film Only If...,"Own this plodding, lackluster film ONLY IF: (1) like myself, you need to complete your Miklos Rozsa film score/movie collection of this erstwhile hard-to-obtain DVD; (2) you need to witness how handsome hero John Justin (Ahmad from ""Thief of Bagdad"") has aged over a period of 14 years; (3) you find yourself eager and willing to ponder how Gene Kelly could ever have permitted himself to star in such a predictable cinematic BOMB!"
2,"Good sound qualtity, but...","The Good:Great Sound QualityThe bad:Uncomfortablebroke easilyI got these headphones as part of the Zune travel pack. The sound quality on these headphones is far superior the generic earbuds that shipper with my zune. The inner-ear setup of these headphones is very uncomfortable. The earbuds would not stay in my ears, and when i could force them in the pressure created by the head phones gave me a head ache. Now, three days after purchase the left ear bud has broken and i have decided to retire these earbuds and purchase high end headphones.Would not purchase again."
2,Not good enough for the money I paid,These earbuds aren't as good as I thought they would be. For some reason if its plugged in right to my Zune it sounds garbled but if I leave it out some it works. I don't have this problems with other headphones. Then they don't work well while I'm running. They slip out almost as much as the ones that came with the Zune. I would not recommend wasting your money on these.
1,Waste of money,Zune Premium Earphones thats nothing but a joke and a catch line to get your eye I have tried every size plug they include and no matter what I do I cant get them to stay in my ears even while just sitting if I would have know this I would never have spent the money!!!
2,Good but no Shure,"On a recent trip I bought the SE110 Sound Isolating Earphones for $99 at a store in the Chicago airport. Worth every penny and incredible for an ""entry level"" set. I took a chance on the reasonable price Amazon offered on the Zune premium in ear phones thinking they may be as nice as the Shures. Whole different category; the Shure's have deeper bass and sound less distorted, but I think I only paid $12-16 for the Zune pair. The Zunes were a close out offered as an upgrade for the original 30GB Zune. Hopefully the 2nd gen Zunes have earphones that compare to the quality of the Shure entry level professional systems. The in ear systems beat the over-ear noise reduction in all categories."
1,Piece of cr@p!!!!!,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. Is a totally piece of sh.. It worked, let's say.. 5 times... During a half hour Flight, the left earbud stop working, I did actually heard the very moment that start failing... doing annoying noises.. and after a minute of hear that, simply stop working. I always used to carry them in the case..all the time, and I always treat them very well, I can assure you that they never hit the ground or handle them roughgly... Is just Chinese cr@ap... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!! even if they cost a buck!!"
2,Less then What I had hoped for...,"First let me say I am a big supporter of the Zune, and it's software. I love it and wouldn't mind investing my money into a second generation early 2008.But these headphones suck, sorry to say the sound was terrible. I'm a visual effects major and I'm around various sound equipment on a weekly basis. The quality is less then ideal. The head phones that came with my Zune far surpass these. My Major problems are below.Cons:1: Lack of sound Quality.2: Can't get them to stay in my ear, feel like I'm probing my ear.3: Noise Canceling feature, definitively didn't work.4: PricePros:1: Awesome carrying case2: Magnet earphones work better then the original Zune, snap well."
2,"zune ""premium"" earphones",these earbuds suck. they come in a real nice case and the sound quality was good but they broke in a week. i like the ones that came with my zune. i thought these would have lasted longer but i was wrong. the cord is plastic not like the ones that came with my zune.
2,Uncomfortable,The earphones are not very comfortable and don't sit in my ear well. The original pair that come with the device are functionally much better.
4,"For the price I paid, they are great.","I only paid $5.00 for these Zune headphones. For that price, they are working great. The sound quality is amazing and I like the case they come with. I only have two minor issues. First, the cord is on the short side. Second, even the smallest in-ear covers were too large to fit comfortably in my ears. Luckily, my old headphones had a smaller set that worked on these. I'm a pretty small person, though, so I don't think this will really be an issue for most other people.Overall, I am satisfied."
2,The Products are messed up,"In both headphones i purchased from closeoutmaster, one of the earphone buds wasn't working and i can only listen to music in one earphone....The ironic part is both of the headphones i purchased had the same problem!"
2,Didn't last long,"Easy transaction and fast shipping. Really liked them at first, fit well and had great noise canceling. However, one side of the earphones quit working after two weeks."
2,Right ear piece did not work,well when i got it in the mail and connected it the right ear piece was not working so now i have to send it back :(
2,Not improvement over stock Zune headphones,"I've tried a lot of earphones and I don't like the sound in these as much as the headphones that came with the Zune HD. I saw them here on Amazon - $10 including shipping, so a good deal. However, they aren't any good for moving around. The earpiece does seal around the ear, but when moving it constantly comes out. Plus, the unit is sensitive to touch, so you hear any rubbing or even the vibration of feet when walking. Bottom line is that both my wife and I find the basic Zune headphones sound better."
2,I loved these headphones till...,"I love my Zune 30GB. I have the first gen big fat bulky one too but I love my Zune to death and I don't know what I'd do without it. But this is becoming a very annoying problem with Zune headphones. They all crap out on me way too damn fast. The one's that came with the Zune lasted about 4-5 months then just flat out died. But then years later after subbing in other headphones for my Zune I get the premium ones thinking that they will be ever better and more awesome and they are (especially in the sound quality and the noise cancelling) that is until only a few months later where the left bud blows out and I get almost no sound to it. I'm never again getting anything Zune in terms of headphones. My Zune is a beast taking any and all punishment (even when I sometimes want it to break to justify getting a newer one) but their earphones' durability sucks, AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
4,Excellent Sound,"I am very happy with these headphones. The sound quality is excellent. I have been startled by the Bass a few times thinking it must be coming from somewhere else. It does look like the version 2 of these headphones have a better covering to the cables and I was originally going to pay up for those but for $15 these are a great deal. I can see why they upgraded the covering to the cables. The way they are packaged leaves them bending back and forth. With time these straighten out. Still, not a big deal."
4,Great Earphones!,"Great sound with best bass I've heard in headphones and the price is right! Premium product,get some"
1,These are not Premium earphones,These earphones are not Premium Zune earphones since they do not have the cloth cord that the Premium earphones have. The cord is plastic.Since Zune has slowly died off I thought these might be the cloth type since the price was advertised as $40.00 originally but no luck!
2,Not great,"These buds sound pretty good, but they don't fit your ear, no matter which of the 3 supplied sets of rubber pieces you use. The cord is horrible and cheap feeling, and I just can't recommend these to anybody."
1,very short lifespan,left earbud died after 3 months... and im not the only one apparantlyi replaced them with the v-moda moda wrap earbuds which so far are much better
2,Zune Premium Earphones,The earphones are good quality and have a very good sound quality but they are uncomfortable and keep on dropping out of my ear. They are too complicated to wrap up and put in the case every time. I used them for 1 week and lost interest so i bought a cheaper pair and use those now.
1,"Terrible sound, painful to wear","The box is handy, as are the adjustable sizes, however the adjustable sizes are completely useless given the fact that no matter what size you choose, they either fall out or have to be shoved so far in your ear that it hurts. That fact aside, they're not even worth it because the sound is horrible; there's no bass at all, so there's no depth to the sound. Honestly, I was far better off with my normal (and cheaper) headphones that my Zune came with. If you have sensitive ears or actually like good sound, don't waste your money on these. Go for the standard Zune headphones; they're much more comfortable, don't fall out, and have better sound."
1,Worked great for a few weeks and then the left sound went out.,"These headphones worked great for a few weeks. They sounded great and were very comfortable. Then the sound went out on the left side. From reading the other reviews, that seems to be a very common problem."
3,Sound great but hurt to wear,"These headphones really bummed me out. They sound great and are very reasonably priced. The problem for me is that they are very uncomfortable to wear for long periods and they do not stay snugly in my ears for more than 3-5 minutes. I have to continuously push them back in which irritates my ears. I had the second gen Zune originals for a long time and never had this problem. Came with 3 sets of soft covers for the buds, none fit me. This problem wouldn't effect everyone; but if you have small ear canals these buds are not for you. Too bad too, they sounds really good for the couple minutes that they are in right."
3,not bad,"not bad, but not great either. the head phones that came with my zune are more comfortable and have a richer base sound."
3,Good Heaphones.,"These are great headphones, with good bass and they blocked outside noise perfectly but after only a few weeks the left headphone stopped working..."
3,"Decent enough, i guess.","I bought these earphones on amazon.com along with my zune. They worked just fine for about 6 months,then the left earphone died. Wow, lop-sided sound blows. However, when they DID work, and i don't know how long a set of ear buds should last you, They took six months of punishing farm life. The sound quality definitely is easily topped by other products, but for only 30 bucks, you get what you pay for. And on top of that, they're the most comfortable ear buds i've ever had. They stay in too. You don't even feel them. Great for sleeping in, got me through a nine hour flight like no time had passed at all. All in all, a neutral investment. Nothing flashy here, but certainly not bad."
4,Poor Quality Product,"These earphones are awesome and I cant tell the difference between sound from these and V2,The bass is really good and makes up for the lack of an equalizer on the Zune. The earphones fit pretty well but they are not too comfortable, unless you use another size of ear bud.Edit- Ok so far I bought 2 pairs from different sellers and the first one stooped working on the left ear after 1 week so I bought another pair,the second one straight out of the box the left ear was not working."
1,NOT PREMIUM,"I am not satisfied with the 'premium' label on this product. They do not work or sound any better than the standard earphones that came with the Zune, and they do not fit comfortably. I do not even use them."
2,It broke!,"I had the ear phones for about 3 days and loved them, they fit nice and sounded good, but then the jack broke off, so now ive got to find a new pair of headphones"
2,"Good sound, poor quality","These headphones come with a pretty nifty carrying case, but they're wrapped so tightly you won't ever get the kinks out of the cord. The sound is excellent, with strong punchy bass, but you have to shove them all the way into your ear canal to be able to hear it, which means they're usually covered with earwax. Gross.The biggest problem is, I bought them, used them for two weeks, then the left one stopped working. They weren't damaged or strained in any way. Just poorly built."
3,Wish these were a bit more powerful,"You cannot ""feel"" much of the bass so music sounds pretty flat on these earphones. What I liked was that they were very stylish and the case was very useful. I recommend looking at other earphones in a similar price range unless you prefer visual appearance over use"
2,Stopped working,"I really enjoyed these while they worked. Unfortunately, after only three weeks, the right earpiece stopped working for no apparent reason. Earphones are not any good unless both sides work!!!"
2,poor,I'm disappointed. Poor sound. They don't feel right wire are stiff and brittle. I'll never purchase another pair of these.
2,Don't waste your money,They don't stay in your ears with any of the buds big or small. Don't buy these.
4,Zune headphones,Great sounding headphones. Only issue is my little ears that have problems holding even the smallest pieces. Otherwise they are the best sounding headphones
3,Do not fit or stay put in the ear,"What more can I say? It doesn't matter much how good they sound or how long they last if they can't stay put in your ear. The smallest size will stay in for about 20 seconds before falling out, and that is without any movement from myself. The medium and large sizes almost instantly fall out. Try them on first, otherwise avoid like the plague.Edit - bought a cheap pair of ear buds, removed the soft cover part that goes into your ear and moved them over to these zune premium earbuds. this solved my fitting problem, but was still a hassle and cost me additional money. however, the sound is fantastic on this set. changing my review from 1 star to 3 stars. excellent sound, but fit was very miss for me."
1,DON'T BUY THESE,"The sound quality was fine for me, But one ear goes out after a month. I bought 3 sets and when the first went out I thought it was a fluke. Now the second has gone out in the exact same amount of time. These things are crap."
1,Might be good if,"These were pretty good when they worked. I used them about 6 times when I was running and after that one stopped working completely, 34 days after I received them. So I'm out $10 with a useless pair earphones. Might be good if you use them only when walking or sitting around, but they are clearly not high enough quality to use for any sort of sporting activity."
2,Wasn't what I thought it'd be,My old zune earphones broke so I decided to buy a pair of these and I do regret it. First off it looks cool that it has its own case and everything but if you use it its more of a hassle than just wrapping it around your mp3. Another thing is that they don't stay in your ear so you keep having to shove them in. You can always feel them in your ear where its uncomfortable. The sound quality is worse than the stock headphones for the zune. I wish I put my money towards bose earphones. My brother has a pair and they are sweet.
1,I don't think so,"Not good, less than originals that came with the Zune.Maybe mine where just bad quality control, but the grated my nerves with treble.It is hard to believe these are 32 ohm headphones. My free headphones that came with my Cel phone sounds so much better.If Microsoft does not learn that the little details make the difference, then they will fail in this market and with the X-box 360 too.The Zune is nice and has a very wide range frequency, better than the ipod, and I should know cause I have both. But next time I won't take a chance with any Zune accessories."
2,Zune Headphones fall short,"I was really dissapointed with these headphones. The right one will not stay in my ear, while the left one fits too deep inside the ear canal. They do block out all other sound, but when I run with them and the chord bounces, I can hear the interference. Really quite a waste of time, I wish I hadn't broken the free ear buds that came with the Zune in the first place. Spend your money on decent headphones, not these."
3,"Good sound, poor earpiece","I have had these for a few weeks and love the sound they reproduce, but I don't care for the piece itself. The shape of the earpiece does not fit correctly in the ear and therefore consistently falls out. Luckily I bought them for $4.99 and not the full retail. Maybe people with siphon shaped ear canals will have a better fit with this. (LOL)."
2,Zune Ear Buds,The head phones are good but by the time i got them they were damaged in the left earbud. I would always have to ajust the left earbud.
3,"Sounds Great, but is as prone to dieing as a kamakazi pilot. Seriously.","I have had three pairs of these headphones to date, and two of those pairs within the same month. Don't get me wrong: They sound excellent for the price you pay for them. But they are EXTREMELY fragile. So if you are one of those people who takes really good care of their headphones, and just uses them calmly in the library or airplanes, these are a great choice. But for everyone else, find a different pair, unless you want a pair of broken headphones.By the way, before I submit this, as of march 31 2009, zune (microsoft) has officially ended their product support for this item. Even they can't handle the frequency of broken headphones. And they are their product."
1,Didn't work,"I had to return them because they didn't work. I like that they came with different size earbuds but I could not get a good fit from any of the sizes - the ear pieces were so soft they couldn't hold the weight of the cord. Again, I can't speak to the audio quality because they didn't work in my Zune player."
3,Works okay,"This is something I don't plan on using for a very long time. It works okay in some ways. To me its better than standard headphones and being that its snugged in your ear, you could hear some bass. It is what it is and I wasn't expecting alot from it. There isn't any instructions but, simple plug in and listen. Also comes with 3 different sizes of ear caps or rubbers or whatever you call them. If bass is your thing and expectations are high, go for something else. For me its good enough. Hope this somewhat helps and sorry I wasn't too descriptive. Quite general."
5,Fun with-- and beyond-- the book,"Kids-- and their grownups-- will love joining those quirky characters, Penny & Polo, as they travel the world in search of the perfect sandwich ingredients. Sandwich Expedition begs to be read aloud, but you can listen to Robert Llewellyn's pitch-perfect reading on the accompanying CD. Examine Jay Sopp's illustrations carefully and you'll delight in both the humorous details and classical compositions. Then, inspired by Penny & Polo, tour the international food aisle of your local grocery gathering samples of the foods mentioned in the text. Sandwich Adventure becomes not only a multi-sensory adventure for the whole family, but supper as well."
5,A Must Read for those of the Deep South,"This book had the same impact on me as Rachel Carson's SILENT SPRING, but even more so, because ECOLOGY OF A CRACKER CHILDHOOD takes place in my own backyard.Ray blends nature history with the story of her life, and you become aware that she really is a ""child of the pines"". Selected as the Best Non-Fiction Book of 2000 by Southern Book Critics Circle, ECOLOGY OF A CRACKER CHILDHOOD should be required reading in Georgia high schools."
5,Two Truths,"Ms. Ray opened her heart to us in ""Ecology Of A Cracker Childhood."" Just when you think the expression ""tree huggers"" is a negative, along comes Ms. Ray with a wonderful explantion of why we should all be so concerned about our woodlands. Ms. Ray's love for her family and particularly the stories of her father are very touching. Truly entertaining and a story well told."
5,Great Read,"I am still reading Ecology of a Cracker Childhood, but can highly recommend it as a soulful and intelligent read. The author cleverly intertwines a memoir of her childhood in rural southern Georgia with the history of the disappearing longleaf pine forests."
4,Heaven On Earth,"This book has one particular section titled ""Heaven on Earth,"" which avidly depicts the sublime religious influences that faith and church can have on young low-income Americans, and how their view of God and Church can become more depicted by those around them than by actual mature thought. This book was a required reading for my college level English course, and I would suggest it to any student of English or Culture."
5,The trees do sing ...,"The book touches hearts. She is honest about a difficult subject, her father's illness, and she tells his story with gentle love. She loves her land, and her trees do sing, as do her words and feelings. Her love for her family, for her piece of the earth, and our pieces of the earth shine through everything she writes in this book."
4,Two books in One,Thoroughly enjoyable and educational. Every other chapter is about the endangered longleaf pine which once stretched from Viginia to Louisiana. The true identy and origin of the term Cracker is explained clearly for the first time. Also embedded in the chapters not about the longleaf pine is a long and continuing observation and explanation about mental illness. The passage written by her mentally ill father describing his view of his illness is quite powerful. For me it gave new insight into the state of Georgia and the settlers in the southern portion. I was initially dreading it would go overboard on ecology but the balance she seems to show between human and plant life kept me reading.
1,Goldman needed to buy a house...,"...that is the only reason I can think of for resurrecting his beloved MARATHON MAN characters, completely rewriting their history, and shoving them awkwardly into a story that could have just as easily featured characters from THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Not only did he write a ridiculous book--a man creates a drug that makes a racist homophobe have sex with a black man!--he did the unforgiveable: he undid much of the power of MARATHON MAN. Turns out that tragic, shocking death in MARATHON MAN didn't even happen...Scylla's just been living on an island. Really unfair and embarrassing. Can only reccommend it on a purely camp level."
2,Disapointing sequal,"I loved Marathon Man and have read it several times. As a rule I also am a great admirer of William Goldman as a writer. However, on more than one occasion he has read as if he was phoning in the stories.This is one such case. Most of the characters are killed within a chapter of being introduced. As a result, there is little drama as it becomes obvious that the only question is how the adversaries of Scylla will meet their ends within a few pages of being introduced.Skip this one. Re-read Marathon Man instead."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"In this sequel to Marathon man, Scylla is improbably resurrected; inexplicably changes sexual orientation and acquires an ex-wife; and evinces no curiosity whatsoever concerning the fate of his former live-in, Janey. In addition, the ""inventions"" upon which Goldman bases his plot are patently ridiculous. And yet... and yet... I've read this book three times. Scylla is a modern Tarzan, a brilliant mind in an exceptional body; brutal yet romantic; his only weakness his love for his kid brother. A powerful fantasy."
5,THE BEST BLACK METAL RELEASE EVAR!!!!!,MAN THIS IS THEIR BEST RELEASE SINCE DEATHCRUSH!!! I DON'T REMEMBER THEIR SKIN BEING AS DARK THO!
1,typical eighties crap,"If zero stars was an option I'd take it. In a decade when flash and fashion over style and substance was the norm this is as bad as it got. Even the cheezy aspects of ""Classic Rock"" or cock rock were not this bad. At least they used real instruments. The toneless-super-low-baritone-I wanna-be-the-male-vocal-equivalent-to-Cher sounds especially dreadful next to those girls. ""Fascination"" attempts to be funky with that synth bassline and melodic but it is a wasted effort."
2,Just buy an 80's Collection,"Two songs, ""Human"" and ""Don't You Want Me"", that is all they gave the 80's. Just buy an 80' CD for those two, the rest are not worth the money."
4,west coast reference,"Though not a pearl of the repertoire, it is a good historical register of that era. The musicians are a star team."
1,This did not work at all..,"I bought this because it was recommended to me . Our dog died and the area where he died became infested with fleas a couple weeks later. I don't know if one has anything to do with the other. But anyway,I bought 2 bottles of this and sprayed the yard focusing on the problem area. I did this 2 days in a row because the first day saw no changes. The fleas in that area are so bad that if you put anything down there you can hear the fleas start jumping. Yesterday was the second day . This morning when I went to check,they were just as bad. No difference whatsoever. By the way,I bought at Walmart for $19.95 a bottle."
3,"Jane, we hardly knew ye","Ms. Siberry's latest offering is a bit of a disappointment. Come to think of it, her last 4 CDs have been disappointing.Firstly, she doesn't seem to be writing her own songs anymore. In addition to her voice it was her unique song lyrics that attracted me. Now I don't know what to expect next from her. A collection of Gershwin tunes? A melody of Helen Reddy's greatest hits?Secondly, less than 40 minutes???? C'mon! When this CD was first advertized on Amazon.com it was going for $24.99. Even at the ""reduced rate"" of $20.99, I feel like I'm being robbed. Who out there is releasing CDs that are less than 40 minutes??? Jane, you mean to tell me that you can't find a few more ditties? (your oh-too-clever liner notes notwithstanding)Thirdly, as a physician and a music lover I feel duty-bound to say this: Ms. Siberry, stop smoking! You can hear the effects in your voice (beyond the expected changes that go with age), & your photographs are downright scary! Yikes!"
5,Best Bike Cleaner/Degreaser on the Market,"I love this degreaser, it is so effective, yet very gentle on the seals, decals, etc. It really breaks down grease & dirt very quickly and it rinses really easily-which I love. Definitely worth the small price premium for the time savings and residue free cleaning job that it offers."
3,Very good in the breadmaker but in oven ....,"Before my breadmaker arrived I tried this mix by the Kitchenaid Standmixer, the dough was very sticky, so I've had to add more breadflour. Eventhought the dough was still sticky and I've let them rise almost 4 hours before baking, it came out of the oven very dry and it tasted sour... so so... not really good. The second mix I put in the breadmaker and just let the breadmaker do his job, it came out very good , the taste is perfect. If you have a breadmaker and you like sourdoug bread, you should try this mix"
4,1950's music fan,"I searched for the most complete anthology of Pat Boone'soverall music career, and selected this two-cd set. The soundquality seems quite good to me, and all of his best-knownsongs are included from the 1950's and 60's. The included booklet summarizes his career objectively. In addition, thereis a chronilogical listing as to where and when all these songspeaked on the charts. There is also a thorough discography ofall his album releases over the years."
2,Pat Boone CD,"I'm not happy with this CD. These are not the original recordings, and I did not find any notification that the recordings were not original or that they had been re-mastered.This CD was made in Holland, and should have stayed there."
5,Yummy sonic layers,"This is Fiver's second CD. It takes the strengths from their first CD, Eventually Something Cool Will Happen--creative instrumentation and indie-pop hooks--and adds lush layers of rock that many have compared to Radiohead, Pavement, and Grandaddy. (Grandaddy's Jason Lytle produced Fiver's first CD.)Fiver recommends listening to their music with headphones and I agree completely. The depth of sound and the experience is not the same over the loud speakers. The last track, ""theme from lo-down"" is the best example of this. The seven-minute track floats and glides in a blissfull, spacy trance. Guitarist Chris Doud's skill is showcased as the track progresses from quiet to rocking and then back to quiet. Light a candle, put on your best headphones, and drift off with this track.The whole CD holds up to frequent listens...you'll become intimate with the nuances of the music, discover new quirks, and learn to love these Modesto boys."
2,YAWN,"In a word, YAWN. I agree with the previous reviewer that this is elevator music, for the most part. This is definitely my least favorite HoJo cd. The Japanese precursor ""Angels and Lovers"", which contains many of the same tracks, is a tad better (but not much)."
1,"if you were a dance/pop fan in the 80's, don't even bother","While Howard Jones is obviously a very talented and lyrically gifted musician, for those of us who were partial to the synth-pop sounds of the 80's, which some would argue progressed into the 90's euro/dance/pop sound, this is not an album worth listening to. The same can be said of his previous album, In The Running. While some of us may have ""matured"" and now prefer ""elevator music"", or adult contemporary styles, this does not describe the vast majority of Howard's fans from the 80's. The number of people who turn out for his concerts tells the story (i.e. less than 100 in Toronto, Canada - almost embarassing really). Remixed versions of Angels & Lovers and Let The People Have Their Say were a good college try."
5,optimal environmental education,"I feel lucky to have been a student of Dr. Kaufman's Environmental Biology class at Miami University. This textbook was the first and perhaps only in which I was excited to get to the basement of Brill Science Library in order to bury my nose in its every page. Dr. Kaufman and his Biosphere 2000 have forever altered the course of my life and I feel it can, if taught right, have the same impact on any truth seeking student of the world. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Peace."
4,Cheap and it works!,"Had some doubts before buying the product, but it's worked out well. Battery life is pretty normal even when left unused it seems to hold it's charge without losing much juice. I'd buy it again!"
3,short life,"I was pleased that this was so inexpensive, but now I'm wondering if it's because it's not that good. The battery life does not last nearly as long as my original did. Good thing I bought two so I can always have a back up charged and ready to go."
1,You get what you pay for!,These batteries dont fit in the battery compartment. You have to squeeze them in and good luck getting it back out!
3,Camer battery tight fit.,"I haven't had this battery long enough to comment on it's longevity. It's holding up well now. One problem from the get go... I have an Olympus C770 digital ""Ultra zoom"" camera. The battery is a very tight fit in it. I have added a piece of cellophane tape folded above the battery top to act as a pull tab to be able to more conveniently remove it as opposed to prying it out with my pocket knife.recommend it? If they are all like this, no- not for this brand camera at least."
5,A fly fishierman's treasure,"This book has been one of those ""must read"" books for fly fishers of trout. Joe Brooks is one of the top writers of old. Great book, great information. I was pleased to receive it so quickly, ordering through Amazon."
4,Classic,"This book is a classic. Much of the tackle and equipment is dated but the information is well presented and is useful for both a beginner as well as an experienced fly fisherman. He goes into more casting detail and types of casts than most of the books I've read. If nothing else, it fun to read about the sport of fly fishing from a perspective that existed 40 years ago."
4,Chilled Out Vibe...,Pretty chill music. Good for smoking to. Good trip-hop tunes to have playing at a get together.
5,Sunday Afternoon,"Another great disc from K&D. This one will go well with a glass of wine on a Sunday afternoon. Find a comfy chair, sit back and relax."
5,the 5am selection,Say you've partied all night long... Say its 5am and you need to lay back and watch an early sunrise... put K&D Sessions on and relax. There is no better choice.
3,Reality check.,"Okay, a few things other reviews have not mentioned: This CD is not beatmixed. I repeat, it is not beatmixed. It's simply a compilation of songs played one after another. Secondly, this CD is very mellow. It is definitely mood music on the mellow tip. In addition, all of the songs are K&D's remix versions, so they all have a similar sound. If you're looking for something similar, but more eclectic, definitely check out DJ Kicks Thievery Corporation. The Thievery Corporation mix has more of a warm, summery sound - whereas this CD has more of a closed in, dark sound. This is because all of the songs are K&D's take on the original version - hence they all have the K&D production signature. All in all, the CDs are enjoyable, but ultimately isn't engaging enough to be on the essential list."
3,out-dated formula,"K&D rely too much on a sample-laden formula that was quite impressive for its novelty back in '95. Sessions is definately more creative and musically dense than the lot of the so-called ""Acid-Jazz, trip-hop"" scene that sounds like futuristic, blue-eyed soul devoid of soul. K&D does create some luscious atmospheres, its just the stock grooves and especially the sampled voices that make me cringe (you know, the typical diva crooning some sexy one liner..""I luv this feeling, yes I do""). This is why I'd suggest checking out K&D's latest side project, Peace Orchestra. It's much more nebulous, subtle and organic. As for better sample-based electronic music I prefer Howie B.'s Music for Babies and the latest Pan American."
4,"Chilly, chill, chill","If you're wanting to branch out musicaly and trip-hop seems like something you might be interested in, then check out the K & D Sessions. This is one of the best electronic albums I own and I've recomended it to several of my friends. They've all enjoyed it."
5,a true masterpiece,"this album reflects the abiltity of K&D to get people addicted to their tunes. it is one of the greatest albums in my collection. it truly is a masterpiece and it ranges from some very cool jugle over to some kind of very mellow hip-hop beats to the second cd, which is there for you when you need to chill out. trip-hop and a little ambient of the finest. this cd is a must! even my girlfriend likes it. lol."
5,"Love it, Dance to it, and everything else to it :D",I love the liquidy ryhthmic sound to it. I put tracks 7 & 8 on repeat and just dance or workout till my body feels like its jello.
5,Excellent!,I just recently started getting into downtempo chill electronica or whatever it's called (there are so many sub-genres of electronic music it's insane). I read all the rave reviews of this album and decided to order it along with some other artists.I wasn't dissapointed. This two CD set is awesome! I absolutely love it. The reviews were dead on. Go ahead and make the purchase.
5,The essence of K&D. A masterpiece of remixes,"Kruder and Dorfmeister choose all the perfect songs. Count Basic's ""Speechless"" is amazingly laid back. I had never heard anything by the Sofa Surfers before this album. It's so laid back...a mix CD of jazz, hip-hop, and just plain chillout grooves. I will never get tired of this album. Both CDs are equally enthralling. I must have every by K&D."
3,Brilliant but bloated compilation.,"After living continuously with K&D's DJ Kicks compilation I had hoped this CD would match the earlier's seamless groove, instead what we get is an overdose of needless remixes aside some glorious down tempo tracks. I'm afraid I don't reach for this album very often - probably, I'ld grab some Massive Attack."
2,"Contrary to popular opinion, this CD isn't to die for.","I bought this CD after reading the numerous positive reviewshere. But after listening it, I must admit that I've beendisappointed. Yes, the music is mellow, smooth, and definitely sets a mood. But if I wanted to listen to loungey jazz with a beat, I'd buy a remix of Herb Albert. And don't get me wrong, I like jazz ... but the mixes on this CD feel ordinary. I know my opinion is in the minority here, but it's something to consider before you purchase this music."
4,Worth the purchase,"I love K&D. This disc has a nice mix across all their levels but, to be honest, if you don't own the DJ-Kicks album- buy that first. Then you'll know perfection and go buy this one."
5,"Perfect for Homework, chilling out or Sessin'","This is not only great background music for doing your daily tasks, it's great music period. I just got the cd today and have already loved every second of it. Usually I'm more into the faster, harder stuff, but I heard this at a friends house once and just thought it was tight. It is the perfect music to accomplish any task."
5,Freaking unbelievable.,"Alright. I'm a diehard Pink Floyd fan but I have been listening to them straight for over 12 years now; it's time to dive into some different bands because I've played every Floyd album to death. (Not that I'm sick of the Floyd, I just need some new music.)This brings me to this album. I saw the reviews on Amazon and decided to order the album. Well, finally it came in the mail and let me just say that I can't get this out of the CD player at all.If you like downtempo, electronic, syth, weed-smoking music, chill stuff or whatever you want to call it, then this is a must have for your collection.Now, I'm not joking about this one folks, if you at all like Floyd at all, this is a freaking must!"
5,Great American Music!,"""If misery was a crime then I'd always be serving time""...what a great lyric! Wayne is one of those artists that defy easy classification and that's what I like about him. I was blown away by this record when I first heard it. Passionate, visceral and original, Wayne knows how to make good ole American music with flair and style!"
1,That's what daaddy wants.Wane Hancock III,I receved the cd and on two of the songs there is a skip or a space and is very annoying... otherwise all is well. Leo
3,Seen Its Day,"Originally translated from the French, in 1973 this title has since ceased to be the definative work that it once was. In the last 30 years a lot has been published on WWI.However, it still can add material to those interested in a cursory review of the war from the French (Western Front) perspective. Which is also, one of the books great flaws. (Naval and particularly American participation get short shrift, while the Eastern Front fares a little better.)"
3,Historical Analysis,"Ferro's book is a great piece of work to help understand the First World War. The opening chapter is perhaps the best part of the analysis, as it brings the reader into the story. The book however is one of my least favorite Great War books, and by the middle of the book sort of drags on. But nonetheless, the book is recommended!"
3,Ferro The Great War,"I was /am very interested in the subject (/World War I)after I had read Keegan on the same subject.Although This author has so many facts and dates and figures , the translation into English is far from perfect."
1,Good!,"I find this book very interesting and good. It keeps you on the edge of your seat! This book will tell you about what is to come and will let you experience what lies ahead, as well as learn more about God."
5,Amazing!,This book is the best out of the series in my opinion. I read it in 1 day because I couldn't put it down. It's great to see how kids might get along after the Rapture.
3,A little more disapointing,"this book was OK, but I found it a little disappointing. Probably just because I don't like Nada. Oh, well. You should still read the series. It's the best series I know. This is just one of the worse books in the series, in my opinion."
2,"Yeah, Whatever","The word 'remix' is not a term one really expects to hear in the same sentence as the name Dolly Parton, and there is nothing here to indicate why this should change anytinme in the near future."
5,"This game was defective, but it's okay","This didn't work my game console, but it worked on my friends though. That's okay I just keep it anyway."
4,"Strong ending, boring beginning","This was my first Charles Willeford novel. I was very eager to read a Hoke Moseley mystery. There is no doubt that Willeford can write and he deals out endless character development. My complaint is that until the flurry of excitement at the end, things just move to slow. I don't always sympathize or identify with Hoke Mosely either. I have a copy of ""The way we die now"" and will give Willeford and Hoke another shot. ""Sideswipe"" wasn't a bad book entirely, but at times it was a boring book."
4,Every English speaking Muslim should have this book!,"This book by Dr. Nasr is a book which was waiting to be written and it could not have been written by a more qualified person. I learnt a lot about the intellectual history of Islamic thought from this book (philosophy, mystical ideas, speculative theology) and how it has developed throughout the ages to the present. I also was very very impressed by the scholarly yet succint way in which the major philosophical and intellectual movements which shaped the history of the West were presented. This again greatly increased my knowledge. These first two sections were excellent. The third section was not as strong as the other two--how Muslims should respond to the Western dominance at present and a comparative overview--as it was too brief. This though is an excellent book. I hope that Dr. Nasr writes another version of this book--for adults this time following the same format but including a lot more detail and references and bibliography."
3,An Englishman's Opinion,"""Songs from an English Garden"".Not one of Lanz's better offerings.I have been a big fan of David Lanz sinse I first heard him on""Art of Landscape"" on British Television in the late Eighties,with Natural States and Desert Vision.Apart from the brilliant ""Nights in White Satin"" and ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" arrangments I think this album does not bring out the best of his own creative style which were so spellbinding in early works such as the album's he created withPaul Speer.This is by far the weakest album I have heard by David,but having said that It will appeal to those fans who like his arrangments of other artists masterpieces.If,as a previous reviewer mentioned he has left Narada for another record company,hopefully we may have more of his own compositions in the earlier style that is so familier to us all."
3,The simple beauty of the piano is lost in this album.,"I have many of David Lanz's Cd's and I am used to getting peaceful, relaxing music, PIANO music. Not piano music clouded up with a multitude of other, intrusive instruments. I was disappointed in this Cd because he has lost sight of what normally makes his music so simplistic and stunning. He tries to be everyman in this Cd and I don't like jazz elements,synthesizers and his attempt to sound like David Arkenstone with big production numbers. I don't mind him reworking other's tunes but I want to hear these songs played on the piano and nothing more. Who can ever forget his haunting version of a ""Whiter Shade Of Pale"". It was exquisite. This is not his best. He should stick to pure piano. Branching out didn't work for him on this album."
3,"Many kinds of breaks, lacking in detail,","The book discusses conditioning, many kinds of breaks (including speed and special materials). Lacks detail, especially on conditioning and points of contact."
1,A waste of time and money,"If you like pictures of people breaking stuff, then buy this book. But otherwise don't waste your time and money. There is a little foreword with no usefull information on breaking and then...NOTHING. Just pictures of the author breaking stuff. Ask any martial arts instructor about breaking and you will learn much more."
2,Shallow and basic,"This book lacks depht. It shows a number of differnet tecniques, and is no doubt inspirational when it comes to new ideas for breking demonstrations. But it did not really give me anything new. Particulary the side kick break could be explained in much more detail, whwn it comes to keeping the body straight at impact and much much more. The pictures are however clear and the book is nice to look at, and for beginners ore novices this is no doubt an entertaining book. But if you practice Karate or Taekwon-Do allready, and has been for more than a year, i guarantee you will not find much new in this book. And if you do then shame on your instructor because this is very very very basic stuff. If you dont belive me, by all means buy the book, after all it has an all right price tag."
3,"Asia is hot, but the rest of the movie is only so-so","A guy is offered a lot of money to track down the elusive ""Jordan."" Along the way he runs into Jordan's sister and a bunch of trouble.This movie was ok. The dvd cover was very vague about the plot so I wasn't sure if I should expect it to be a vampire movie, a mystery movie or both. As it turns out, the movie is just an intrigue/mystery. The vampirism is minimal at best.They really tried to keep the audience interested by having this poor guy go through some bizarre ordeals. Some of them were interesting, others were kind of boring. A big plus is that Asia Argento is pretty hot in this flick. Also the way the main charactor lives and cons/mooches is kind of interesting. If you enjoy movies with a lot of bar/night club scenes, you'll probably enjoy this film."
2,Love bites is more like a love tap,"You would think the cover of this movie would give someone the inclination that it would be the least bit interesting, or even the title would give someone that opinion, but watching this movie made me want to fall asleep. The supposed vampires in it were maybe seen for two scenes, and they were pretty terrible at that. Some of the acting was ok, but for the most part the movie was called. It didn't give the vampire genre any justice. I would say watch this if you obviously have nothing better to do, but do not buy it, I repeat do not buy it. Rent it from the video store, you will see why once you watch it."
1,A Little Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there."
2,slippery squid,"I have used a regular stick-clip before but mine was in bad shape. I decided to upgrade to the Squid Clip and bought an inexpensive painters pole to attach it. I have followed the instructions as have my climbing buddies. We can not seem to get the gate to fully open and stay that way for the clip. By the time we get the clip to the hanger, the draw falls as the gate was not open far enough.I am open to suggestions........please."
4,Amazing Stuff,This book is chock full of amazing things. Reads easily. Many applicable exercises for the every day person.
2,Light Emerging,"I have several copies of this book by the same author. Love the book ! Use them for study groups. This copy when opening was in much poorer condition than the seller really knew . Center binding is failing and the center pages are starting to fall out and if used often is not long for . Binding glue issue.I don't think the seller was aware of the inside binding condition. At first opening it was clear of pages being compromised. No, i would not have bought the book as it is ."
3,Light Emerging,The content of the book is good. I just do not like the large soft cover format. I always have a book with me and this book is not easy to carry around.
2,Another follow up book,"I read Emerging Light with some high expectations, having read Hands of Light. This book was a dissapointment to me. It seems that Barbara followed the path of ""I wrote one successful book, therefore I can cash in one the craze"" that many authors do. There wasn't a lot of really relevant information here, though a few tidbits here and there. When she discusses the cords it didn't seems anywhere near as accurate as when Mark Rich writes about them in Energetic Anatomy. The part about the core star isn't anything I had ever heard of and didn't really resonate with me much. I think sticking with Hands of Light is probably a better idea."
4,Where's the Science?,"This book definitely adds to Barbara's first book 'Hands of Light', but as her being a scientist I ask myself where's the science in this book? She seems to just rely on her spirit guides for everything, even all the stuff she should and probably does know as a well educated person! Why all the push to get everyone involved in the New Age/Eastern Religion stuff and depending on what the spirits say for everything? Instead why not concentrate on teaching people how to do things on their own like Donna Eden does in her book Energy Medicine? If all Brennan's guides chanellings where left out of the book I would have added another star to it's rating."
3,A difficult book to read,"11 years ago when I first got the book, I found it very very hard to read. I had to read multiple times to get a gradual understanding.The good: Verifies the existence of the hara, divinity of each individual human being and presence of psychic cords.The bad:-Contains many ""hidden references"" to psychotherapy and psychological studies. One needs the foundation of family therapy and psychological studies to easily understand it.-Did not give an accurate feel of BBSH, as the process work involved is much more intense and vigorous than what's written here.A serious reader would need to also read books on parenting, relationship management and communication books to fully benefit from Barbara's work."
5,Ahead of her time,Brennan is truly ahead of her time. THis book is relevnat today as ever. A real sea change in conception of the idea of health.
1,Lack of authenticity and void of scientific evidence,"I'm strongly in tune with the first and second reviewers. There is no scientific evidence given for the practice written in this book. At any rate, light body is an ancient druidic exercise which is dissimilar to what is written in this book. In fact, the exercise in the book is a simplified sky and earth energy training of chi-chuang and druidry. All in all, the author has created yet another assumed energy channels and failed to note that chakras are one of many energy centres . If you're interested in cultivating your healing abilities and skills or healing magic, I would suggest you should be consulting authentic books on druidry and Nortern magic tradtion such as those written by Carr-Gomm and Pennick or join your local chi-chuang group."
4,Good book,"Very good practical book for people who see and are practicing Reiki,very comforting,and teaches you to to take care yourself so you can give to others."
2,Slow Moving!,"I agree with the person that called this a ""so,so read"". I was disapointed after reading ""Educating Caroline"" which was a very good story. Now, I'm not sure I should read anymore of Ms. Cabot's books. I liked the two main charactors, but the almost constant revealing of their thoughts and thinking things out was oh so boring. When they were acturally together, it was good reading. I started skipping paragraphs frequently in order to get to the good parts of them being together. The intimacy was well done."
2,"DON""T READ IF YOU HAVE ANY CLUE ABOUT MEDICAL HISTORY","The romance was typical and expected the situations about par but the medical history - lets just say my teeth hurt. These were not the only research errors in the book either. I would not have had a problem if she had styled it to happen the same time as the true history but to igenore real history and come up with a complete alternate tale that was less likely without any mention of the greats of the period ...left a totally unsatisfying read. Basically if you want to read a historical romance don't read this, if you just want to read a romance and know nothing of ranks or history - this will be a run of the mill one for you but at least digestable."
5,Great like all the other Pet Shop characters,These toys are great for both gender children age 3 and up!
4,JON GIBSONS STEVE WONDER FLAVORED GOSPEL,"THE BROTHER IS JUST THE BOMB, HIS MUSIC IS MELODIOUS,SOULFULLY MIND EXPANDING, AND ANOINTED, IM JUST IN AWE EVERY TIME I HERE THIS MAN SING, SONG'S LIKE {FLY WITH THE WIND-I WILL BE THERE F OR YOU-HEART OF GOLD}IT'S NOT A DIS TO THE WONDER, THE BROTHER JUST SOUNDS LIKE HIM AND HE LEAVES YOU HUNGRY FOR MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,good enough for me,"nothing wrong with this comic book , nothing at all , it serve as good example of the qualities that made the avengers what they are & more, and that's all I have to say ."
3,"Good lyrics and arrangements, but no sparkle","Another interesting album by Fossati, with plenty of sophisticated arrangements, does not reach the levels of his best ones.His quasi-narrated lyrics are still supreme but the album doesn't have the sparkle of ""Macrame'"" or ""Discanto"" and the others. An interesting product for the Fossati's aficionados, but not a must from his superb collection of compositions. Yet, warm and effective, the traditional ballad ""Rondine"" is very well performed and moving to tears."
1,Beautiful fossil,"Apparently photographer Stoller was commissioned by architects and developers to portray their interests in commercially flattering ways. So this ""Modern Architecture"" doesn't even pretend to weigh the successes and failures of modernism. It's a beautiful fossil, a nostalgic catalogue of the vanished certainties of the Mies-ozoic era."
4,Works Great,"The pre-filter wrap does what it is supposed to, keeps off water and dust. After washing my car, I can see the beads of water on and dripping off of the pre-filter. I can also see a thin layer of dust forming on it, which is great because it is keeping the service intervals on my K&N filter longer. However, if I remember correctly, K&N states that the pre-filter's water-repelling properties will diminish after two years. That is the only reason as to why I did not give it 5 stars."
4,Perfect,"This is perfect for stopping the bigger stuff such as leaves, bugs and feathers worth the money to save your filter from damage from forein objects."
1,soooo painful!,"these are beautiful - but soooooo painful- I really cannot wear them- they are very narrow......sucha shame, I really loved the look of these."
2,Over - the - Top!,"These are definitly ""wow"" shoes, but...the 4"" heel makes them look a little too much like dancer shoes. If the heel were at 3"" they would not have been too over the top for me. Plus, it may have been possible to walk more than just from the car to the party!"
5,Seafood Tool Set with forks and lobster crackers,We had a crab leg party with six guests. The crackers and forks were just perfect and worked like a charm. I love Amazon. The quick delivery was awesome and the item was just as described in the ad.
4,Gift for friend,"Came timely and in good order and undamaged. He hasn't used yet, so I can't say for sure about the quality.."
2,Good forks but poor crackers,"The tool set looks very nice. The forks can pick up the crab meat easily, but the hinge of the cracker fell apart when I tried to work on a normal-size claw."
3,Crab Cracker and Picks,"I have not a chance to use these items yet. They seem to be cheaply constructed. Received item in time alloted and packed nicely. Being from Eastern North Carolina, I eat a lot of crabs, so I hope they hold up."
4,Najma - a first impression,"I became interested in Najma after hearing her at a festival last summer, and being struck by the mixture of Indian and jazz influences with a stunningly soulful voice. I sent off for 2 cds, 'Vivid' (reviewed elsewhere and 'Pukar'.'Pukar' (Calling You) is a collection of songs about love and marriage. Unfortunately I am rather past the age of romantic illusions myself, but nevertheless I like the mix of rhythms, modal melodies, and jazz. My personal favourite is 'Jhoomo Gao' (Let's Dance and Sing), a lively wedding song in 3/4.The other songs generally follow a formula of a steady 4-in-a-bar rhythm, with long-held synth chords, soulful vocals, instrumental solos, and lively and varied percussion creating a rich and varied texture. The rhythm section together with some unexpected melodic shifts adds life to the proceedings, although some more up-tempo numbers would be welcome!"
4,Pair with Potter's Bible,Good starter set. My wife is just starting to learn all about pottery but said that the tools have been more than adequate.
3,Cheep,I needed the kit for a college pottery class the tools were nice to have and useful; but they fell apart quickly there is only one tool out of the bunch that lasted to the end of my class.
5,8 piece pottery set,Great value and this nicely packaged kit is all the tools beginners need to hand build with clay or on the pottery wheel.
2,A Below Average Curiosity from the Great Dan Curtis,"I was very excited to see this Frankenstein advertised, being a fan of other Curtis productions like Dark Shadows, The Night Stalker, and the Jack Palance version of Dracula. However, this movie occupies a curious limbo. In style, production values, and acting, it is very much like the original Dark Shadows TV series. It even has almost identical music by the same composer, and the presence of John Karlen (Willie from Dark Shadows) as the doctor's sidekick. But what worked well in the context of an ongoing Gothic soap is rather disappointing when transplanted to a feature. The whole look of the production is particularly stagebound, which is probably the fault of poor lighting. It's a bit like watching an amateur theatrical. Nothing becomes believable, or atmospheric, enough to be moving. A much better TV adaptation from around the same time isFrankenstein - The True Storywith James Mason and Jane Seymour."
1,dc frankenstein,i love dan curtis stuff but this tested my limits in viewing displeasure a very slow moving film or as the monster might say me dead
2,"""Dark Shadows"" Lite","If your bar is set as low as ""Dark Shadows"" in terms of production values (read 'cheap') then this Dan Curtis edition may be to your liking. I found it poor not only in those terms (and I say that as one who loved the original ""Dark Shadows"") but also found its story telling weak. I am still looking for an impressive made-for-TV version I saw as a child in the seventies. This ABC video Frankenstein is not it."
1,Find something else to watch!,"With imagination, a viewer might be able to see some connection to Shelley's novel; however, the production was extremely poor. (Example that brought a chuckle: brown hair sticking out from under a black wig!) I haven't really seen a Frankenstein movie that I thought was good, but this rendition falls to the bottom of my list! A waste of money!"
4,"Close in spirit to the book, wonderfully sympathetic!","It doesn't take Victor & the Creature to the Arctic, but it's still so close to the spirit of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. This was first on TV when I was 11 & I felt so sad for the Creature. There a few changes- the blind friend is a pretty young woman, but it makes matters even more poignant. The film starts with the Paradise Lost quote of the title page of the book, and the theme continues throughout. If you love the tale of Frankenstein, you need this version!"
1,Change the Litter Box,Well DC once again proving their characters are laffable at best and NO competition for Marvel-This was the WORST thing I've ever seen makes the 70's Hulk and Spidey TV shows look like masterpieces.Maybe DC will get it right someday
3,A Great Sci Fi writer an okay book.,"I've been reading Andre since the 70's, and while the book was okay, it didn't thrill me like most of his work."
4,A well-remembered favorite,"My daughters both enjoy reading science fiction. While discussing The Hunger Games, I told them about Starman's Son. Although I had forgotten a lot of the details or perhaps didn't understand them fully as a young teen, I do recall it being one my favorite books. I am anxious to read it again and share it with kids."
3,Da um beijo pra gente!,"Banda Beijo is a tipical example of the passion behind brazilian music. This album is full of cool beats, fun lyrics, and honest brazilian feeling. Gil is a good singer with a strong sense of passion in her vocals. They are not a main stream Axe' band, but I can see that future works will bring this band much success. ""Meu O nome e' gil"", is a good album to introduce you to the world of Brazilian music.Compra'-lo agora!...."
3,Heaven Knows,"I originally heard the song ""Heaven Knows"" in the movie ""Hackers"". At the time I didn't even know the title of the song or the artist. After some research I found it to be Squeeze. I really haven't listened to the other songs because I like this one so much. This particular song reminds me of how I feel about the man in my life and I couldn't wait to share it with him. I suppose it's one of those songs that most men refer to as ""girly music"", I guess that's why I like it so much."
2,NO FANTASTIC PLACE,"I too had hoped these tunes would grow on me being a life-long Squeeze fan but they just seem bland an uninteresting. This like any Squeeze effort has a few moments. The nostalgic ""Electric Trains"" is very touching and reminds me of the Squeeze of the ""Argybargy"" period. ""Daphne"" also is a great song, somewhat reminiscent musically of XTC's ""Dear God"". Then there is ""This Summer"" which is a great slice of pop heaven. Other than that, filler and three good songs do not a classic make."
3,Below par effort,"I suppose this really hovers below 3 stars. There is an air of lethargy about this album that really never lifts, with ""Electric Trains"" and the excellent ""This Summer"", really being the only saving graces on a listless album. Fortunately, it was followed by the far superior ""Domino""."
4,Seiko Men's Watch #SGF536,"The watch is handsome, but it runs about a second slow per week. The local Seiko dealer adjusted the band for free to fit my wrist but said he could not adjust the speed at which it runs."
5,Dallas Cowboy Watch a Hit!,"What a terrific watch! Purchased for my 7 year nephew. He wears it everyday. It fits him perfectly. It is a great looking watch.I would recommend this product for anyone that wants to impress a grandson, nephew, little brother or son. My nephew was so surprised, and of course dad (my brother)was totally impressed with my selection."
2,Nothing new here,I found this to be a typical Jenny Randles book so if you're a fan of hers you'll enjoy it. I thought it focused too much on government documents and missing film and not enough on the Men In Black. Randles seems to have gone into the book with the pre-conceived notion that the MIB are government secret agents and spends the next 200 pages trying unsuccessfully to prove it. The book offered nothing new about the topic.
3,A different view of the UFO saga,"Its good to read local and therefore more interesting possibly more credible UFO news. At times far fetched but nevertheless thought provoking, and what if its all true? Well worth reading, if not for a different angle to the subject"
1,The problem with ufology are books like these,"The truth behind Men in Black is that it makes for an interesting topic to write a conspiracy book about, no doubt the author will make a lot of money off credulous UFO ""researchers."" This book has zero evidence, or value for that matter. The documents she includes are worthless-- there's a document about Roswell and a few other things, but they have nothing to do with MIB's. Poor research, poor book, poor me for wasting my money on it."
5,Great!,"This is a great DVD! It did a really good job showing us some of Switchfoot's live show, and I think everyone should have it. New fans or old, everyone will appreciate this. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
5,Incredible!,I've waited and waited for a full show DVD from SF and here it is. It's got some awesome 'Switchfootage' on there! A must have for the avid Christian Rock fan.
3,Not without flaws,"Good sound, good selection of their library, OK video, ??? presentation. The lead singer sure was sweating A LOT! You'd think he would have done something about it, used a towel or something."
3,Switchfoot Live in San Diego,"Great music, but the sound quality could be better. The volume is weak and it doesn't really have a nice full sound. This band and music this good deserves a much better recording."
4,The first review...,"I was lucky enough to be able to attend this concert last Fall. I was so excited for the DVD to be out, and it's finally here. I was so glad that there were lots of songs on it. It was much longer than Switchfootage. I love hearing live versions of the songs and hearing everyone sing along, so it's great. I do wish there could have been more as far as behind the scenes and interview sections though. They left me wanting to hear more. These guys are so inspiring and I love to hear how they think about life. The video was great, and I look forward to what the guys of Switchfoot will put out next."
3,The album is better than this DVD,"I really enjoyed Switchfoot's CD ""The Beautiful Letdown"". It is ground breaking album for this up and coming band. Unfortunately, this DVD does not do the best job of representing the band's efforts. As others have noted the sound quality is not great, and the video footage does not capture much of the band's energy. Simply put - it is somewhat boring to watch.On the positive side, the song list from the concert does include all the best songs from ""The Beautiful Letdown"". But, I was disappointed that there was not more extra material beyond the concert. There are a few short interviews, and a video, but nothing more. Therefore, I recommend that listeners stick with the CD, it is much better than this DVD."
2,SWEEEEET,"THIS DVD IS AWESOME!!!! EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THIS! THESE GUYS ROCK! THEY CLEARLY ARE THE BEST BAND OUT THERE IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC, AND IT SHOWS THROUGH THEIR AMAZING MUSICAL TALENT AS WELL AS SONG WRITING!PURELY GENIUS! CHECK OUT THEIR OTHER DVD ""SWITCHFOOTAGE"""
3,It's a Big Letdown,"With their latest album, The Beautiful Letdown, climbing the charts and grabbing mainstream attention, Switchfoot is the latest rave. Sadly, their first concert video is a bigtime letdown. Capturing a rock concert for the small screen is no easy task, and the wide angle shots and close-ups just aren't enough. The video fails to capture the sweat and pulse of a real concert, though the audio is worth a listen (select tracks available on iTunes).The boys should have sprung for the textured look of film as opposed to video and learned a thing or two from bands like U2 about staging and framing a shot. Of course that's a lot to live up to. We could just enjoy the DVD more as a live recording and turn off the picture.The extras include the ""Meant to Live"" video (ho-hum: band rocks hard while some guy literally cuts down the walls -- ooh, deep!), a behind the scenes look at the video (even more ho-hum), and a short interview with the band where they speak candidly about faith and art."
5,So Awesome!!!,This dvd is so awesome! Its like you're really at a Switchfoot concert! Plus you get to hear interviews of the band. I completely reccomend getting this dvd. On it are some of Switchfoot's greatest songs from the Beutiful Letdown. Its so full of passion and you can see the band truly has a heart for God.
5,Awesome,"The new Switchfoot DVD is totally awesome. It has a live concert, interviews, and the new Meant To Live Music Video and the behind the sceens of Meant To live. It is so awesome and they are such a great band and they have good values."
3,A basic guide on using karate against armed attackers.,"This book is the 4th in the Practical Karate six book series put out by Nakayama and Draeger. I found this particular book interesting in its approach to using karate against an armed assailant. In my humble opinion, it would be difficult even for a karate expert to defend against someone armed with a weapon. As a lifetime student of the martial arts of karate, Jujitsu, and kobudo, I know how dangerous it is to defend against someone who is armed with some weapon. Nevertheless, this text is valuable to anyone who is serious about their training and desires a book to suppliment their actual karate practice under an expert. This book covers karate self-defense techniques against knives, bottles and sticks. In conclusion, this is a good book for those interested in the basic principles of defending against armed assailants.Rating: 3 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Shotokan Karate Self-Defense Techniques: Practical Combat for the streets)"
3,"Light-Hearted, But Not Original","I love Mandy Moore, but this film was not one of her best. It did not show a stretch in her acting, and the plot was so unbelievable. The boy she meets in Europe is definitely cute, however, and the grown-ups in this film such as Mark Harmon are very good."
4,Charming,"This flick is typical with a twist. Girl runs away, hot british guy keeps her out of trouble, they fall in love. The twist: she is the presidents daughter, and he is in the secret service. The only thing is that she doesn't know it. With out this intreguing plot element, the movie would just be another unbearable chick flick. It is a cute film; good 'snuggle' material. Enjoy!"
4,Really likable romantic comedy,"If you are a fan of the romantic comedy genre you will like this movie. Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode were terrific in this movie. They had a nice chemistry. Mandy was likable and less annoying than most in this genre. They should had spent a little more focus on Matthew. He had good screen presence and appeal, I hope to see more of him in other movies. My only complaint was that the ending was cut-off. It did drag on a bit in the beginning but it was needed to set up a more believeable storyline. It does have brief nudity, which was a surprise. I had low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like it. The movie takes place mostly in Europe and there are some beautiful scenes/locations."
4,Decent Chick Flick,"I enjoyed this movie. While it is pretty much the same as First Daughter, you have to remember that Chasing Liberty came out AFTER First Daughter. If you like ""Chick-Flicks"" you should try this one out. I liked it because the movie kept moving at a fairly good pace and added a few little twists here and there."
5,A Chase Worth Watching,"I went to watch this movie with no hopes of a great turn out from what I had heard. I love ""A Walk to Remember"" so I was dying to see ""Chasing Liberty"", I think Mandy Moore is a good actress. The movie was really cute, it kept you going and interested throughout the entire movie. It was quickly paced and very enjoyable and romantic. They couldn't have picked two better people to play the main characters- Anna & Ben. Definitely a movie I'm going to buy!"
5,Hot Movie,"""Chasing Liberty"" was such an awesome movie. Mandy Moore was excellent in portraying a president's daughter who's only wish is to have more freedom. She looks excellent and acts really well. Matthew Goode, who plays her secret service agent/love interest is amazing. He is such a good actor and his looks don't hurt him at all. He definitely is the next ""Brad Pitt""...although cuter!! Go see it."
5,A Subtle Hit,"You have to be really in tune with emotions, life in general, and have an appreciation for freedom of expression to rate this movie more than 3 stars. I rated it 5 stars without hesitation.I felt that the acting (by all) was outstanding. The cinematography was excellent. I see 2-3 new releases a week and feel that I can recognize the bad from the good. The story was not real strong....however, it was ""real"". Two love stories in one movie, a touch of International flavor, and a heap of humanity from all the characters. I was glad to spend the price of admission.Even though I would classify this movie in the ""Chick Flick"" genre, my wife was not as enthusiastic about this movie as I was.We braved the ice and snow to see this movie on 1/9/04 at the Century Theatres in Portland Oregon. This is a wonderful place to see all the new releases."
2,Where's the soundtrack?,"I was hoping to find a soundtrack CD for this movie. The movie reminds me of some of my travels through Europe as a college student, though the story here was predictable. I thought the music throughout the movie was very catchy and would like to listen to more."
2,disappointing,"I agree with many previous posters that the portrayal of inept Secret Service agents is kind of scary. However, that's not why I didn't like the movie. I was disturbed that a supposedly intelligent and politically savvy daughter of the President would so little value herself as to throw herself at anyone willing to take her virginity. Of course, Ben resisted her the first time, but gave in when it seemed the alternative was to witness her hooking up with GusGus. Where was her pride and where was his sense of decency?It also bothered me that the McGruff character was treated so lightly after his theft of their money left the pair penniless in Europe.On another note, Mandy Moore is a beautiful and statuesque young woman. They should cast her opposite a similar physical type. Matthew Goode is tall enough but looks like a pinhead pencil neck geek paired with Mandy. Is anyone else bothered by the fact her head is bigger than his?"
4,Cutie,This was a movie I went to the movies to see and enjoyed thoroughly. Its delightful and refreshing for young love.Thank you.
2,Thumbs down!,"Having been a big fan of Mandy Moore, I thought this movie would be pretty good. Almost everything that could turn a movie sour happens here. For one, Mandy isn't really acting in this movie. She sort of poses and pouts. There really is no depth to her character. The movie loses direction in the first thirty minutes and continues at an alarmingly boring pace. Anna wants freedom. Dad promises Anna freedom. Dad doesn't keep his promise. Anna's mad. Anna gets supervised freedom. Anna wants to have sex with an undercover agent. Wham Bam they fall in love after a few angsty scenes, end of story. No depth and direction make Chasing Libety somewhat boring, but the Mandy Moore fan may enjoy it."
1,never got the movie,"i didnt get my movie. where is my movie, i been waiting for it and since i ordered more than 10 movies i totaly forgot about this one. please send me the movie.thank you"
3,Lightweight Liberty,Though the plot of this movie was unrealistic. I couldn't help but like the movie. Both Mandy Moore who is known for Walk to Remember and How to Deal made this movie credible. Not without mention the two secret agents who were hired to follow the president daughter they were funny and entertaining. Matthew Goode performance was fine but he's has a long way to go. Mark Hamon was great as well. Special features of DVD Pasport to Europe was fantastic. While is not the best it's not the worst
4,one of Mandy Moore's best,My favorite Mandy Moore movie. I don't like any of the other ones that she is in. I giv eit 4 stars
1,Not one of my favourite,"I so enjoyed Mandy Moore in Walk to Remember, but this movie was a very big disappointment. It lacked depth and was not a patch on First Daughter. I kept waiting for it to take off and my thoughts at the end was it was a story all about a young woman having a tantrum looking for someone to take her to bed to give her value. Even The President lacked any depth and yet he is one of my favourite i NCIS, I dont miss this TV show. Sorry I bought the dvd and wont recommended it to others."
5,Scenic Romantic Comedy,"I love Mandy Moore and Mathew Goode in this movie. They have great chemistry and they travel in Europe, so the scenery is wonderful. This movie is well written and the actors were all outstanding. It's a light romantic comedy, just pure pleasure to watch."
1,Disappointing,A terrible movie. Very predictable & so stupid! Don't waste your time on this one. Mandy Moore was a big disappointment in this too. I know she can do better. I rarely comment on movies but this one was just so bad!!!!
1,Terrible,"It was simply awful... That all one needs to say...I wish that I could take back that time I wasted watching (more like yawning through) this movie...Mandy Moore is at her worse. Was it possible to be worse then she was in How To Deal? Does that question need answering???Yes, she is even more terrible than she was in How to Deal...The idea of the movie sounded cute (reason for me to go and waste my money on this movie), and the commercial made the movie look promising...This movie really deserves a 0 star... it was that bad..."
1,"Three words, boring boring boring!","If you want to watch a bad movie, this is it! Every step in the movie is predictible, the actors are miscast, and there is no chemistry between the two lovebirds. Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode act next to each other not with each other. The scenes are superficial, there is no underlying story; this movie is a collection of stereotype love scenes that appaeread in previous movies. Bad all the way!"
2,Below Average,My two kids walked away during this rental so that was a key indicator. There is good scenery however.
2,Just another chick flick.,"If your like me and got stuck taking your girlfriend into this movie, you knew that it was [bad.] Okay okay well Mandy's acting saved it for the most part, but it was the australian guy who handed out the $3,000,000 dollar man stickers that kept me awake during this old, oftenreused, script. It's not very original and you know that they're all gonna live happily ever after, and there are no surprises or plot twists, just Mandy Moore taking her clothes off, and for guys that's a plus. All in all it's okay, but I believe a Walk to Remember was much better than this outing for Mandy."
4,very entertaining,"It seems I get more into romantic comedies as I grow older as long as they have a ""happy ending"". Chasing Liberty is just the type I enjoy. Everything about the transaction went very well and I was very satisfied with the DVD."
4,Love mandy moore,"I love mandy moore, both in singing and acting. I felt like she did a wonderufl job in this movie. I loved watching it. Made me want to be the presidents daughter!"
5,OLD SCHOOL CHARLOTTE LAMB,this book is one my favorite HPs...the plot is very different from the usual HP plots..one of Lamb's earlier works so it is non-pc which i love...great book!
5,A great small space saving-DVD player!!!,This GPX D1816SIL DVD Player with remote has BOTH great picture and sound and it's light and compact!!! And it's very affordable!!! Great for those who have kids and want a reliable but not expensive DVD player!!! My whole family enjoys it!!! Very recommended!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars A+
1,it is not worth even free,well i own it for two days and it already giving me trouble like half way into the movie it freezes with all the movies and so it start playing from the beginning but then i had to go thru it to find were i was and i well and it seem it be playing fine but it do it again and it also started as if the motor on it about to go out and also own another gpx dvd before but was not great either had that one for a month and the laser went out on that one too
1,Terrible DVD Player,"I bought this dvd player to replace a dvd player that would not play rented movies. This player has the same problem. It plays the previews fine but locks up or displays a choppy, purple, pixilated screen when the movie starts. Burned video from my camcorder works fine. Avoid if you buy or rent movies. Mine is personally headed for the landfill and I barely got to use it."
1,Junk - I guess we get what we paid for,"Purchased this DVD player 6 months ago - used very infrequently. This morning tried to get the RENTED DVD out and the thing wouldn't turn on. Spoke to customer service rep who politely informed me that warranty lasts 90 days so I'm out of luck. Ended up taking the whole thing apart myself to get the dvd out - after that pieces are going in the trash..... Oh well, at least I didn't spend a lot of money in the first place. I still feel like I threw the money straight in the trash can...."
5,Spare for RV,"This unit was purchased for our young children to watch movies while camping in our RV. Even though it was very inexpensive (14.99 on sale at a hardware store) it has worked flawlessly with every movie we have tried (including burned movies from out TIVO). This unit outperforms other, more expensive units we have owned. The remote works very well. My only complaint (minor) is the lack of a ""F"" connector output. Make sure your TV has RCA audio/video, S-Video, or composite inputs."
2,Barely acceptable,"Mine could play Netflix rentals without any problems. However, several months into its lifespan, when I'd turn it on it wouldn't always stay on. But once I got it to stay on it would stay on indefinitely, so I just left it on full-time. But today when I inserted a DVD, it shut off and wouldn't turn on again. I had to take the housing off to retrieve the DVD.I agree with the reviewers who hate the remote. It's hard to use, and you need a clear unobstructed line of sight for it to work. I'm not buying one of these ever again."
2,Cute but not great quality,"This is a cute and convenient set for quick redecorating. The quality isn't great - the picture frame came a bit scratched, and height chart has really rough fabric, and the bookends are really light. I do like the bins, they seem sturdy. Overall, it's an okay set but I don't know if it will last long term."
5,Read it in 12 hours!,"This book is excellent! I picked this book up on a rainy day at the beach and stayed up untill 2am to finish it. I could not put it down. This is real life, real people who experience all of this first hand. To disike this book, you would have to have no interest in human nature. It is very real, very human, & I think it is a must read for any one who has had their heart broken."
1,What have you people been smoking?,"This books is awful! It doesn't give you any more information, codes, cheats or tips that you can find for free on the Internet! What good is an official book if there's no benefit? Why should I pay so much money for information I can get for free? Prima should be ashamed of themselves! They're ripping us off!"
1,LAME!,"Why would ANYONE need this book? All it does is tell you the moves, and how to get the secret characters. The controls are so easy, and to get the secret characters all you need to do is win the titles."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"GREAT NAME, HORRIBLE CRAFTMANSHIP.AFTER THE FIRST WASH, ALL THE INSIDE SEAMS CAME APART.I FOLLOWED THE WASHING DIRECTIONS ON THE TAG, HOWEVER IT SHOWS THAT THEY SURE DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO."
2,BELOW PAR,"I bought the album Fitchburg Street, which is great, so I bought this one, which was disappointing. Doyle Bramhall was clearly still developing."
2,Not worth the mess,I got one of these and after a few days feathers are coming out everywhere - looks ok and feels nice but not worth the mess it makes pulling feathers out.
1,Not a good buy.,"I know I got a Down Comforter set for only 39.99 but it is not even worth that. I never write bad reviews about anything but this is the worst. Its feathers are ALL coming out, major shedding. Imagine how that looks on a BLACK comforter. And remember this is a down comforter, it doesn't go into a cover. I contacted Amazon to let them know about this and They are giving me a full refund. So Thanks Amazon for your great customer service!!!"
4,Chocolate Brown Set,"I really love this comforter set. I read a couple of reviews before I purchased it, so I knew what to expect. It's not too big and fluffy, which is fine for me because I'd rather wash it myself than send it to the dry cleaners. It's very soft and comfortable and I complimented it with some nice throw pillows, so it looks awesome."
3,***,"I'm really not sure what to think of, quality wise. I dont really have anything to compare it to. But I think its worth the 35.00 I spent on it. The bad thing is I got a california king and this comforter doesnt cover the whole thing on the sides!! So its short on the sides! I really do like the sage color and the way it feels. Its not thin but not not too heavy or bulky. Just a shame it doesnt fit the way I want it to :("
2,At least its warm,"I was excited to receive this set because I love the color red and really wanted to try a down comforter. I slept great the first night and I loved the microsuede fabric. I did not like, however, how each time i touched it the feathers would come flying out. Each time i fluff it to make my bed, there are feathers everywhere. I HATE that. Its perfect as long as i dont sleep on it."
1,"very thin, very little or no down","it had very little to no down. It looks like there is some filler it the photo, but when I received it the comforter had no fill. Somehow it got passed quality control with no down in it."
1,Not the quality I expected,I purchased this item and sent it back after opening it. The seams were coming apart and it was really thin. I didn't expect anything great but this was a lot less than I expected.
2,Didn't last long,"No problem with the shams or bed skirt and I loved the color, but the feathers in the comforter started coming out very quickly. It really looks like I plucked a chicken on my bed. I was less than pleased with the set, but for the price, I guess I got what I paid for."
2,Feathers all over the bed,"Pros - Comforter is warm and you get a good night sleepCons - You may get a good nite sleep, but when you wake up, you will find feathers allover the bed.The feathers keep coming out from comforter cover. I used this for a week and have thrown this. I don't want the hassle of removing feathers from my bed every day.Can I get a refund on this ?"
3,"Overall, not a bad deal","Got this at an EXCELLENT price, quality is decent. If the price was right I would probably buy this again."
5,great buy,"love the comforter,it is so soft and very very warm. Better than the one I paid lots more money for. So glad I jumped on it and got it when I did, they went fast."
4,Bedding,"The comforter is very nice and warm, my only negative comment, is that the feathers come out from time to time. I am quite satisfied with it especially for the price."
2,Soft but terribly messy,"The microsuede is incredibly soft. the pillow covers are great, but i have feathers EVERYWHERE. They come out very easily and make a mess of the entire place."
2,not able to use,"The comforter is soft and pretty however, it isn't very full and fluffy. The worst of it is that the down feathers fall out of the comforter's thin material and make a mess in the bed. We are not able to use this comforter at all."
2,falls apart,"poor quality. Feathers everywhere. I normally dont write reviews, but I strongly suggest you do not get this."
3,Soft but Messy,"As stated in the other reviews, this is an AMAZINGLY soft set, and the pillow cases are fantastic. It's very light-weight but big enough to where I can bunch it up if I'm ever too cold. The sheer amount of tiny downy feathers that slip out of it is maddening though, they're *EVERYWHERE*. Since I bought this in Navy, they're clearly visible all over it too. I keep having to attack the whole thing with tape every couple days just to get them all off of it so it doesn't look like a baby duckling exploded on my bed."
3,Nice Price but completely satisfied,"I purchased this comforter for my little sister(16). It matched her room perfectly. Now it is starting to show the feathers. They are poking out on the comforter. So instead of black it looks like black with white dots. Looks a little cheap. Anyway, other than that, it is very warm. Caution: If you are allergic to feathers, do not purchase this product."
3,Nice and Warm But....,"Don't get me wrong, this thing was a steal at the price that I got it for but after several nights using the comforter, I noticed that the down feather started to ""seep"" out of the covers. I might have to use another cover. Still use it but with a duvet cover."
1,not that great of a set,Not that great of a set because it's overpriced for one and there's almost no down in the comforter. You're better off going to WalMart or some place like that and buying one. Very disappointed.
1,Great until you clean it,"It was soft and great right out of the bag, however the 1st time we washed it, feathers were everywhere. By the time we washed it the 2nd time, it wasn't more than just a piece of material and had to throw it away. The tag said ""machine wash"", this one must have had a flaw in the material or was just cheaper made. I bought one just like it 6 years ago and it looks as good as the day I bought it after multiple machine washings. I was VERY disappointed in this product."
2,Not Happy,Love the color and how it keep you warm.But a problom with the feathers comeing out. the faethers is over every thing :(
3,"good set, for cheap",The down comforter is losing some feathers not the best quality but what do you want for cheap!
3,Fabric Feels and Looks Good but Feathers Come Out,"The microsuede fabric of this set feels very soft and nice, and looks like suede. It would be beautiful except the down feathers keep coming out so there are white specks about every foot or two which look bad against the black fabric. In the lighter colors, this might not matter so much."
2,"Super thin, don't feel like a down comforter",I was not very satisfied with this product. it is very thin and dont feel like a down comforter. I guess there is little down fill in there. I didnt want to deal with the return procedure and pay the shipping to send it back so I end up kept it to use on the sofa.
3,microsuede down filled comforter set,"Soft & comfortable, this set was bargain priced. The quality is not what I'd hoped for, the fill is comming out, down feathers everywhere. It's in my guest bedroom, so it doesn't get much use. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,duby = great. elemental = okay.,"I'm a big Heather Duby fan, so I'm totally biased. But the second track of this album just explodes. It's incredible, it's powerful, it's intense, it's complex, and it smacks everything up real good. It makes you want to dance really fast 'cause all of the beats. The first track is more mellow. Overall the Duby tracks resemble her work on Post to Wire, probably 'cause the same person produced the tracks. The Elemental tracks aren't bad, but they pale in comparison to Duby. This EP is worth a buy for the first three tracks alone, and the Elemental stuff is just a nice bonus."
5,MAGIC EDDY,was into eddy grant in the 80s and seen him at the mandela 90th birthday and went to see him on tour this is a testimony to a great performer excellent compilation its a pity he did not tour for 20 years very gifted great songs
1,Homemade junk?,This is just a photocopied binder. It looks like something an 8 year old kid would make if they were given a stack of papers and a copier. You'd be better off finding one of the free versions online and printing out your own version. It'd be cheaper and you'd end up with a higher quality product. I would avoid this even for something you keep in your garage and touch with greasy hands. It really was just disappointing.
5,HER BEST ALBUM!!,"I've been an Angela Bofill fan from the begining. And she is a rare talent with a voice that you quickly identify after a note or two. And to be truthful, most of her albums are hit and miss with me. But ""Love in Slow Motion"" is her best complete album. You don't have to skip one song because all of them are great. My favorite cut is ""Real Love"" where Angela is really allowed to show her singing chops without being too over the top!But there are a number of great songs including ""galaxy of my love"" which is going to take you out there to her galaxy of love!I could go on and on but just take my word for it. This is Bofill's best Album and I'm hoping she hasn't stop making music. Come on Angela, we need you!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bypass this one.,"Let me say outright that I didn't get past the fifth chapter, or ""lesson"" as the author calls them. After hinting that this would book would use scientific and rational means, the author indulged in vague and undefined statements like, ""We each have a soul...the animals have no soul..."" Huh? I suppose it could work as a children's book. I think many adults drawn to this subject will find it simplistic and trite, so I would recommend other books for them. Perhaps The Moral Animal (a good introduction to Evolutionary Psychology), The Adapted Mind (a bit weightier), and/or The Biological Basis of Human Behaviour (quite technical in spots)."
3,a good starter book,"true, that the author makes some vague and undefined statements (ie ""humans have a soul...animals do not""), but the discerning reader can see through that and still find value in the book. i almost put the book down after a few chapters because of statements like those, but i'm glad i pressed on. the second half of the book was much more insightful. this book would be of little value to those already well-read on the subject, but i think it's a good book for those just starting out in evolutionary psychology study."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this game for my nephews, but was disappointed to find that it did not come with a quadpod stand. With a pricetag close to $200.00, a stand should have been included. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this game for the price."
4,More Engaging than Most Contemporary Fiction,"There is something in the cadence of the storytelling of The Red-Eye Fever so directly descended from the pulp novel that it took me by surprise to discover that this wonderfully crafted book was, in fact, a memoir. What leaps off the page aren't the reminiscences of a retired school marm from upstate New York, but more the flexing prose of an erstwhile Hemingway or an underdistributed Edgar Rice Burroughs.Simply stated, The Red-Eye Fever is a well-spun and well-muscled adventure. Its two-fisted prose provides a refreshing respite from the solipsistic meanderings that so often characterize this genre; its cinematic sense of structure plays neatly against its historical backdrop. If you're tired of the current crop of wan contemporary fiction, The Red-Eye Fever may be exactly what you are craving."
3,Be careful. The handle bends and it can pinch fingers and hands!,"I bought this guitar for my baby nephew. He loves the Wiggles. He saw this guitar and his eyes lit up and he grabbed for it right away. However....Once we took it out of the package and turned it on I immediately noticed the ""wiggle handle"" bends and looked like it could pinch. Yes, it does pinch if you hold it where the arm/handle bends. I would not recommend this for very small children or toddlers/babies. Basically not a good toy for the recommended age. The music is definitely fun, but the pinching handle is NOT!"
4,"""Night and Day""","Night and Day started out very slow, but developed into a nice story. The story had its moments when I just wanted to put the book up. Callie and Max were very delightful. So if you have a little romantic patients you will like this one!"
2,A Step Down,"I found ""The Pugilist At Rest"" to be the best of his story collections, through and through. Cold Snap has some of my favorite stories, Cold Snap and Dynamite Hands, the middle of the book isn't as strong. This book is a let down from his first two. The opening story is strong, though it isn't as good as ""As of July 6..."" in The Pugilist, which has the same characters. But it has a great scene with Sonny Liston and some funny lines. Mouses is a good story. He read that at the reading I attended. Tarantula wasn't bad either. But in general, it gets a little too silly and Jones is not in the zone. This downfall of material in the late nineties is similar to Paul Auster, one of my other favorite writers. Hopefully one of them will produce something up to their standard in the near future."
2,A Pretty Small Book For A Big Man To Write,"After reading Jones' first collection, I felt that I had found the best American short story writer since Carver (who was the best since Hemingway). His second collection, though not as strong, confirmed that view. And that's why I am so TREMENDOUSLY disappointed in this third collection, which suffers from shocking lapses in professional skill, gratuitous and bizarre ugliness, and blatant confusion and point-of-view contradictions. Is T.J. undergoing a breakdown? Certainly his writing is. But someone of his talent can come back. Oh, yes."
1,Falls Flat,"This collection just doesn't live up to Pugilist At Rest. I hate to say it but the pattern is one of decline. Hopefully, Jones will will get another visit from the muse and reinvigorate his prose. Still, there is no excuse for the phony heart and lackluster prose in this new collection."
2,Mediocre work from a great writer,"Although The Pugilist at Rest is one of the best books I've read, Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine is a real let down. Although there are some really good stories in here, there are others that are questionable at best. ""Roadrunner"", for instance, seems to be merely an excuse for an anecdote in ""A Run Through the Jungle"". ""40, Still at Home"" has its moments of humor but really goes nowhere in terms of story. Many of these pieces seem to be included (and published) because Mr. Jones is hot property. There are point of view problems and structural problems. He is a very talented writer--one of the best out there--but this is a weak collection with only a few shining moments. Buy it if you are a hardcore fan, but don't if you are not."
2,Disappointing,"The title story and ""Fields of Purple Forever,"" are the only bright spots in this otherwise dreary collection, and even these stories don't work with the power and precision of stories from Jones' previous two collections.Jones is an author who writes about what he knows. He is a former marine and an ex-boxer, and therefore marines and boxers feature largely in his stories. However, this collection unfortunately shows that this is not a formula with unlimited longevity. His previous two collections of short stories were masterpieces, but in _Sonny Liston_ Jones runs out of gas.If you appreciated the clever originality and gritty authenticity of _Cold Snap _ and _Pugilist_ you will likely be disappointed with this book."
2,He's Lost His Title Belt,"I am a huge fan of Jone's supreme first collection of stories, Pugilist At Rest. But with the competent Cold Snap and the completely lackluster, Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine, Jones seems to following the path of many great heavyweight fighters. Once the win the belt the get fat and lazy, in Jone's case he rehashes many old themes with language that tries to have the old zip but falls embarasingly short. The title story, Tarantula, and Mouses come close to what his genius used to be but even they have this forced quality that makes me want to beat the crap out of his editor.Someone should have told the champ not to step into the ring with these stories. I have faith that he can make a comeback, but, unfortunatley, with this recent collection mediocrity has knocked him down for the ten count. And I want my $$ back!!!"
4,"Subversive, Knockout Prose","Every once in a while, you run across an author whose use of knock-em', sock-em prose and whose unique worldview throws you off balance, making you reconsider your place within the planets' orbits. Thom Jones is one of those writers. Drawing from influences as diverse as John Edgar Wideman, Garrison Keillor, and David Foster Wallace, Jones forms a mosaic out of life's disappointments and darker desires. Too often in fiction, dark material is delivered with the somber tones of a military chaplain. But when a story exits the foundry of Jones' mind, it bears bad tidings with the most sardonic of smirks. Since some of the stories in this volume have characters that appear in previous Jones' tomes, do yourself a favor -- and buy them all. He has yet to capture Vietnam as well as Tim O'Brien has, but only Thom Jones can take you to a military insane asylum and not only make you belive you're there -- but also make you enjoy your stay."
5,Another beautiful collection from Mr. Jones,"If any reader doubts that Thom Jones is the best fiction writer in America, please read the story ""Mouses"" from ""Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine."" Put away your agenda drums and your preconceived notions and just read as if you were reading for the first time. It's the best that's out there."
2,Stick with Pugilest at Rest,"First of all, i loved Thom Jones first two books. However, this one is not up to snuff. Maybe it's because his first two books were excellent and my standards for Jones are high. But Sonny Liston is awful. The stories have no closure, and you are often left wondering ""is that it? did i miss something?"" I'd love to get my money back on this one. Hopefully this is not indicative of what is left to come from Jones. He is much better than this book. Stick with Cold Snap and Pugilest at Rest. Please!"
4,Just right for kids,"Bought this to assist in 10 year old's keyboard learning. It's geared to a lower level than he is at, but I think it would be perfect for younger children, or even 9-11 year old's who are not as motivated to learn.Alternatives:Another good book, and one we also purchased from Amazon, is John Thompson's Easiest Piano Course (parts one and two). This is easy to read, and follow. John Thompson has another series of books, John Thompson' Modern Course for the Piano, First Grade Book. This is a demanding series and a child should probably finish both of the ""Easiest Piano Course"" books before going into this."
2,picture not the same as product,The picture of the wolf fang decal was pretty awesome. Imagine my surprise when what arrived looked nothing like the picture and was very disappointing. Would not recommend this one.
2,Your basic [money amount]sales brochure,"This book does provide a fairly interesting, if basic, overview of the modern Japanese home but ... it is also an expensive sales brochure for Misawa system built homes. Misawa provided photos for pages 1, 2, 3, 6-10, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 56, 57, 60-63, 68, 69, 76, 77, 78, 79, 82, 88, 89, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 106, 107, 110-118, 120-129. And Misawa is used as an example in the text on 12 pages."
2,It was not what I needed,"I was looking for a commentary that a lay person could understand and use, but this commentary did not meet my needs. The sender did an excellent job in getting the book here and everything; however, the content of the book was not as helpful as what I had hoped."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","An easy read. Not great, but not bad. As you read this book, please remember that this is the 2nd one, and 'this'Jason is different then the Jason X we saw in the film. That may explain why this Jason moves faster, and his method of killing seems different. It would help to read the book before this one, to get the whole back story.I will read the next book in this series, to see where the ideas go."
4,Jason slasher for Jason X fans,I really enjoyed the book as it is a straight continuation of the Jason X movie. Our old friend behind the mask is back and he is not in a good mood! So if you are a Jason buff like me don't hesitate and buy this book. You won't be disappointed!!!!
1,Ick,"Yes, go get some Calculus textbooks! Or is there a ""Calculus for Dummies"" out there? Some explanations for the solutions would have been very nice."
5,great for all children,I love this book for my son (1 year). The illustrations are bright and colorful and the story is cute and creative. A good bedtime read because it is quick!
4,Very fun story and pictures!,"Initially, when I borrowed this book from the library, I was not that impressed. To me, the writing did not flow naturally from the tongue. Try saying ""there were limpets that clung"" or "" a crab sidled by, clicking and clacking it's big claws"" 3 times fast! O.K., now that I've read this book 100 times, it doesn't seem that bad, but at first I just seemed to keep stumbling over the language.However, my 2.5 year old son loves this book, so I eventually purchased my own copy. It is about a fish that fidgets his way into and out of trouble, and my son loves fidgeting along with ""Tiddler."" The illustrations are bright and very descriptive, and you could ""read"" the book without any words at all!I recommend this book if you have a little wiggler - after all, you can't go wrong with a children's book that contains a ""burp!"""
5,"""Fidgety Fish""",This colorful picture book would delight any young child. Wonderful illustrations accent the sweet story of a young fish and his adventures when mother sends him out to play.
4,excellent for the price.,Seiko Men's Watch #SGF649this is a very nice watch for the price. my only complaint is that it is slightly difficult to set the time and date. HSBTR
3,Riddled with many errors,"I bought the book for the Adirondack set plans (Chair, ottoman, and table) and while the finish product is very nice and I am very pleased with it, the plans are full of errors. Cut lengths are not listed right for legs, the plans call for 1X6 stock when it should have been 1X4, etc."
5,Therapy,"Phenomenal book. The strategies actually work. Instead of walking away from a session feeling out of my mind, I've felt light and calm. I heard about the book at a training by gregory lester. I would also recommend that."
5,Wow! Louise Brooks!,"Louise Brooks, probably the most naturally gorgeous and smugly sexy, American female film star of all times, has been reincarnated by way of modern film technology. ""Pandora's Box"", first released in 1929, is now available in a double-disc set which contains this smouldering silent movie plus a softcover text that psychologically analyzes this film which may have been the first to feature a ""really bad girl."" If you're looking for a female star to ring your bell and make you actually appreciate silent movies, I recommend ""Pandora's Box."""
3,"great film, bad music.","This is one of my all time favorite movies. Certainly it is the best of Louise Brooks or G W Pabst in my opinion. She never shines as much as in this film... and Pabst's later films werent nearly as interesting or memorable. The criterion collection includes 3 soundtracks but it is missing the subtle piano soundtrack that was on the vhs release.This soundtrack is a big part of how I originally saw and came to love this movie so that is a major nix for me. As respected as Criterion is, the soundtracks included dont seem to match the movement or themes of the characters nearly as well and for silent film releases I think the use of music is a major issue. So a disappointment."
5,The Best Silent Film,"A great silent film. I highly recommend it. also, see ""Lulu On The Bridge"", a 1999 movie with references to this film."
5,TEN STARS,I bought this because I saw it on IFC channel when they showed Janus films every Tuesday. The movie is absolutely great. The Disc 2 extras which includes a TCM film about 60 min. on Louise Brooks life and career. The best part is an interview with Louise and film clips. Lulu in Berlin is also on the disc. On Disc 1 is the movie and commentary on it. A must buy. Louise Brooks is an icon. Once you see her on screen you will see why.
4,Worth getting for the Interviews,"I remember buying this way back when Storm Front was first released. I live in Australia, and Storm Front was my first introduction to Billy Joel's music, and like everyone else I was completely blown away. The interviews are also good, especially the first one from the mid-eighties. There's one part where he shows how he came up with the lyrics to the song ""Innocent Man"" that has to be heard to be believed. I think that, along with John Farnham, Billy Joel is one of my favourite musical raconteur's. Intelligent, literate, as well as being very witty when he needs to be.Still...now that the four-disc box set has been released, there's probably not much point in buying this edition unless you're a completist. But it doesn't take away from the fact that Billy Joel's music is brilliant. Speaking as an Australian, he's only one of two musicans who (to me) truly represent all that's good about America, the other being Bruce Springsteen."
5,"...you're not John Lennon,no kiddin', you're Paul McCartney!","being familar w/One Mississippi (Bensons first album) i thought i knew what to expect if i picked this up. Man, i could'nt have been more wrong! The songs, every song, builds upon the first record's promise ten fold. Jason Falkner contributes co-writing credits on about half the record; but, even with that, it's obvious that this is Benson ballgame. The craft and care in these tracks ensure maximum enjoyment for fans of power pop, singer songwriter pop, and indie pop alike. Brendan Benson made a splash (critically anyway) in 1996 as a promising new songwriter in the power pop genre; now in 2002, this record is the new high water mark!"
5,It's a shame...,You have to feel bad for Brendan Benson. When you have created a near perfect album such as this how can you possibly follow it up? I took a chance on this after reading an interview with Liz Phair in which she said she'd been listening to it and loved it. Best chance I've ever taken. The songs are absolutely infectious with nary a misstep throughout. If you are a fan of clean power pop with plenty of hooks you can't go wrong here. I'm not one to give five stars very often and don't even review many albums but this one is a can't miss.
2,Lapalco,"I’m a big fan of The Raconteurs and their Consolers of the Lonely album. When I learned that Brendan Benson wrote most of the songs on that album I figured I’d give Lapalco a try. I’ve had the album for the last four days and I’ve listened to Folk Singer, Good to Me and You’re Quiet at least three times a day. The rest of the album not so much.Since Benson is from the D, I expected something a lot less pop and a little more rock. The slower tracks have a Beatlesque sort of feel. I love the Beatles. But let’s admit that a lot of their earlier songs were bubblegum rock and unfortunately so are many on this album. Lapalco is full of catchy riffs and lyrical hooks which you’ll find yourself humming throughout the day. However, its way over produced and tries to appeal to too many people.It’s been fun listening to Lapalco the last few days. I just doubt that I’ll be listening to it at all in a few weeks."
4,genius singer/songwriter,"Genius Detroit singer/songwriter Brendan Benson and best friend number 4592 of Jack White comes out of his room to play on 'Lapalco'.There's always a tendency with a solo singer/songwriter to take themselves too seriously. That and the fact that they generally seem only a moment away from imploding. Brendan Benson is a bit less sad than most though. Sure, all the usual signifiers are in place, songs about girls, lethargy and doubt. However this is coupled with a self deprecating melancholy and he writes fine songs that far from being introverted as you'd expect, lean more towards a sort of Beatles - loving pop.....he once even wrote a song about a hoard of insects taking over the world. stand out tracks include 'metarie' , 'folk singer' , 'you're quiet' , 'what' and 'good to me'."
4,Awesome...,I saw Brendan Benson and the Well-Fed Boys open up for The White Stripes twice this spring. They/He was awesome. I'm going to see them again this November and I can't wait. A great CD and a great live show too.
2,Glad folks like this one,"One good song and the rest were very boring - why the fuss over this guy, everyone says that this is a great CD, maybe his first CD was better.The great thing about music is that there is something out there for everyone. Some people love Creed, and Puddle of Mud, God bless their little hearts. Bottom line is that there are better CDs you should spend your money on. I generally agree with Allmusic.com, but this one is just not up to the quality of similar works."
1,Bad product died in just 9 months,"I will highly recommend not to buy this product. I got this modem from At&t; store. At first it looks good, setup and installation is ok. But after one week the problem get started, it show you solid green light on Internet but it's not allow me to connect. I need to reboot couple of times and then it will start working again. This is a same story every week and month. Finally it died today in just 9 months.So I thought, it would be a great to make review on this product, so one else lose their money. Some final words.BUY IT YOUR OWN RISK"
3,wireless is 54 mbits/s not 108 mbits/s,"this is what it advertises itself to be, an 802.11g modem/router/wireless. that's a wireless speed of 54 mega bit per second. that's really only 24 mega bits per second tops and the further away you get from the access point/modem/router the slower the speed. further away also means if the signal is going through the walls or floor of your house.2WIRE 2700HG ADSL DSL MODEM WIRELESS G ROUTER FIREWALL"
1,"I was sold a box of lights, but at least it wasn't a smoldering bag of dogshit...","The modem I was sold did not work. It was a Not-Modem-Router. It was a box with some flashing lights. It was an Ex-Modem. It was a Modem-No-More.It continues to be a Modem-No-More. It is a recycling chore that I was fool enough to pay for.A Disco Ball would've done me more Telephonic Good, and looked better too.To be fair though, at least it was not a bag of dogshit that was sent to me, neither burning, smoldering, nor well preserved— so it could've been a worse purchase, metaphysically and pedantically-theoretically speaking."
2,not a long term modem,"after purchasing this modem[my 3rd as the first 2 were from at&t]it became clear that it is a great unit.. wile it works.. all 3 units i had broke down within days of warranty expiration.. the first 2 i figured was AT&T getting there money out of me as both expired within 2weeks of warranty running out, but the fact that this one did the same leads me to believe it is the unit. don't get me wrong when it is up and running it cranks out what i need but longevity is important as well"
2,Conked out after 1 year of use,"We got AT&T DSL at home and they recommended this modem/router. Worked reasonably well for a year, not needing to be restarted, etc., until one day, apropos of nothing, it just completely stopped working. No storm, no surge, just crapped out randomly. I called AT&T tech support (and oh how I could write a separate review of that!) and learned that it needed to be replaced. Over at Best Buy, I did some research and talked to a tech guy and found out that wireless G is outdated technology anyway. N is much faster. Got a Netgear with wireless N and it is definitely faster. Don't know if it will oulast the 2Wire but the cost was exactly the same at Best Buy. Long story short: one year of service and outmoded technology means you might consider something else."
1,2wire 2700HG-B,Well i have had this unit for little under 3 weeks and the product is no longer working. According to Att rep it is the unit that is the problem and needs replacing. This is not a very reliable unit resaler if you the product is not going to last at least 6 months before it stop working. On top of that when I originally ordered I asked for a 2wire 2701HG-b unit and was sent the wrong one.
1,Horrible router reliability,"First of all I'd like to state a lot of my frustration is due to att poor tech support. I have been using my 2 wire modem for a few years now along with att. The last year or so I have had problems with my router crashing. I have been on the phone with tech support walking me through all the issues. I had done everything they told me and more. They even sent out a technician twice in which both instances they replaced my router with an ""updated"" 2 wire modem/router. Well after everything is all said and done I got fed up and figured I'd try my luck with another modem/router. Guess what...my internet has never been so stable and fast! I would have to say this modem may ""work"" for a year or so if your ""very"" lucky (from what I've gathered) then gl b/c you're going to have nothing but headaches from then on."
4,Works,The setup was difficult but after a little help from my internet provider I was up and running. Its been about 2 months with no connection problems.
4,A gem of a historical Fidelio; excellent sound for its perio,I bought this CD at a local store on a whim as it was in bargain section and I wasn't really expecting much. I sat up the moment the overture came on. The sound is completely acceptable considering the age of the recording (1944) and the interpretation is honest to goodness old school no-nonsense Beethoven. The singing is truly excellent without a single weak link. This is far preferable to the later recording Karl Bohm made in the 1960s with the Dresden Statskapelle and the squally Gwyneth Jones and unsteady James King. What's more the Leonore III overture is included (often ommited in many recordings. Listen in particular to the finale of Act 2 and many will agree that this even equals (and surpasses on many counts) the legendary Klemperer recording. A truly inspired and revelatory interpretation and for me a steal at the price!
5,An Italian Pantry,"I find myself constantly returning to this book, as well as its sister volumes in the Italian Pantry series, over and over and still finding something new and enjoyable. Olive Oil is something that has been around since ancient times, and yet, only recently are we discovering its myriad uses in the kitchen. This colorful book illustrates the history and production of Olive Oil and presents many simple, yet lavish regional Italian recipes for sauces, preserved items, and entrees. Of course, you can always just keep a little carafe on the table for drizzling over pasta, meats, vegetables, and just about anything else for that matter."
2,"FYI - ""Melamine"" means ""cheap plastic!""","Anyone who's ever owned Corelle dishes has most likely come to expect quality. This brand is known for it's durrability and chip resistance. That is what I expected when purchasing the accessories that matched my dish pattern. Sadly, it is not what I experienced. I hope by clarifying the definition of Malamine as ""cheap plastic,"" readers will know from the item description to move on. This product is not worth it at any price."
4,unclassifiable madness,"there is no genre that the Blue Up? really fit into...(super cute vocals by the lady now known as Ana Voog. She has a live webcam at anacam.com). I picked this album up used without ever listening to it, and I was so charmed by the sound. a little bit folky sometimes, a little rock, a little whimsy. fans of Francesca Lia Block books might like this one. this is what I imagine Weetzie Bat might sound like put ot music. the liner notes offer a puzzle among the lyrics, and the last track of the album is actually the whole album backwards! Ana, if you ever read this, please make some more music!!!!!! one of the forgotten albums of the mid-nineties, I'm always sad that these ladies didn't make more music together."
3,Fun Sound Chip Feature,"This toy has a fun ""barking dog"" sound chip. My dog loved it; unfortunately the sound chip didn't last too long. She chopped down on the toy and broke the sound chip after only one day. What a shame; until then it was lots of fun. You would think that the company would have taken this into account and put something in the stuffed toy to protect the sound chip. We opened up the toy and discovered that the sound chip was inside a hard, thin plastic box. Not too great a design if you ask me!"
3,The sound chip didnt' work in this.....,"Although my Yellow Labrador seems perfectly happy with the two squeakers it has (one on the head, and one at the tail), I was really disappointed that the sound chip was not working. We have no idea what the toy is supposed to sound like, because it has never worked. Other than that, it is a fun toy, & very well made. The squeakers will have to suffice!"
5,Great Book!,I tried learning from videos but it was not working. A friend recommended using a book. This was highly rated - so I bought it. Master Kam-Chuen's book is easy to understand and breaks it down into movements that target specific needs (if you want to work on one area). I am moving like I could not do before I began using the book!
5,Excellent Instructions,"I love this book. It's easy to follow, easy to understand, and the writing and approach contain no psychological or mystical clutter -- you can add that on your own if you like such, but in this book you don't have to put up with reading it. These movements are wonderful, especially when one needs to be energized. I thought I wouldn't enjoy these movements because they aren't vigorous, or at least they didn't seem so. But each time I finish a session, I feel full of energy. Highly, highly recommended!"
3,OK for the price,"There's only one switch of this massager, and that's the bubble. It's not fancy by any means and the motor is kinda loud. But it's ok for its price and it does have a stylist look."
1,NOT MUCH VIBRATION OR BUBBLES,"I had the misfortune of spending the $20 to buy this thing. As soon as you turn on the machine, the vibratory motor can barely be felt. The bubbles? No different than if one blew through a straw. What do you expect for $20? Well, I didn't expect much and got even less. The item does not have sufficient power to make a difference in the feeling of tired feet. I sat there for 30 minutes (as did my wife) and we were astonished at the low power, low quality all-hype performance of our purchase.If you truly want a water foot massager, remember the old axiom: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.For a good jet foot massager, the price range begins at $100. At the price range, foot massagers tend to improve in quality and endurance. As for this item we purchased, I'll use it as a coaster or toss it out.I won't be buying Homedic products any more. This was a surprising dissapointment."
1,bubble foot bath,The foot bath makes a mess with the water and does not keep the water warm. A lot more hassel than it is worth. Sorry I spent my money on it.
2,Lose the romanization and correct the mistakes,"Very disappointing. The romanization is irritating and the dialogues include several mistakes.Ojingo is squid, not octopusTeachers would not use ""nim"" to refer themselves. That's like saying ""I'm the Honorable John Doe."""
3,It's OK,"This book's introduction is very helpful. However, once you get past that it can be a little overwhelming. If lots of words all at once is what you're looking for then it's good. One BIG problem I find is that the exercises are in romanized English, this is not helpful even if you are trying to learn just conversation because once you learn the korean alphabet it is actually easier to use that than English. I would recommend trying to find a book that just introduces the korean alphabet with English sounds and moves away from that romanization style right away. It does have some useful phrases in it but I think there are other better books out there."
2,THE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i got this book like 2 years ago,and its very good i lear how to read, and write.the only reason giving this book 2/5it because its way to spensive this book cost$20 and if i was you i will get it some were else.other than that the book its very very nice"
4,Adapter for the Olympus SP-550 UZ,"To use the telephoto conversion lens on the Olumpus SP-550 UZ, one must have the correct adapter with which to connect the lens to the camera. The camera was so new, I had to wait several weeks before the adapter became available. I had been checking the Olympus Online Store, but decided to take a chance to see if anyone might possibly have it. I was surprised to see that Amazon did, even before Olympus, itself. To use the lens, one must have the adapter. And yes, it does the job."
5,AMAZING!,"This CD is excellent. The music is incredible, and the lyrics are amazing too! I would recommend this CD to anyone, regardless of what type of music you like.. EVERYONE will love this CD."
1,What the author knows about Vietnam is minimal,"The Last Parade is not a book that should have been written by anyone that served in Vietnam (unless they were an REMF), or by anyone that has subsequently traveled back. I am, as a history majory, as a daughter of a Vietnam Veteran, as a wife of another Vietnam Veteran and a woman who has travelled to Vietnam on three occassions since the emargo lifted, embarassed by this author's lack of understanding of the conflict, the country, the politics, the people. I hope no one reads this book and feels that they have an understanding of Vietnam. This is truly a work of fiction."
4,A Fairly Good Introduction to British Shipping & Boating,"This book attempts to introduce the reader to a very broad spectrum of British ships and smaller craft, ranging from great ocean liners and warships to fishing and recreational boats. Using a very good array of photographs, both black and white as well as colour, this book does provide a good overall historical chronology of the development of British shipping and boating, and includes profiles of several selected ship and craft from the liner SS Southern Cross to Motor Torpedo Boats, the Norfolk Wherry, and ""Golden Hind"" class sailboats. All in all, a good coffee table book for light reading, but the serious maritime enthusiast or researcher might be a little disappointed."
5,ASICS Women's Gel Foundation Walker,I had never heard of these shoes before but decided that since they came in a women's 10 1/2 I would give them a try. I was not able to find 10 1/2 or 11's at most stores and if I did get 10 1/2 the price was outrageous. They were listed at $89.99 on sale for $29.99. I received them this week and I have never had shoes that are so comfortable and light weight. I went out walking and didn't come home with my feet and legs aching. They have great support. I am going to order another pair. I have worn many different brands of walking shoes and these are the best.
4,A PLEASANT ALBUM,"Whilst it generally lacks the grunt and bite of the Rythmitist album, I found this a very pleasant album. Nice background music. I have not seen the film which might take a bit away from it for me. Not for everyone but Copeland fans like myself should like it."
5,"Much better than ""Music In Twelve Parts""","The closest music to which I can compare this CD (and the other 2 that follow) is ""Music In Twelve Parts"" by Philip Glass.""The Continuing Story of Counterpoint"" is repetitive, mathematical, and frenetic in the same manner, yet somehow doesn't get dull halfway through like the Glass work. I'm not knocking Glass, but the mood of Borden's work is generally happier and it just has more variety. Much like ""Music In Twelve Parts,"" I always seem to discover something new with each listen.Good stuff!"
1,Movie Buff,"I was looking for a good movie for a Sunday afternoon viewing - this wasn't it. Title sounded good but movie was dissapointing. Bad script, Bad directing, Bad acting, Bad special effects. In short - a bad movie. Whish I could get my money back."
1,Bad Movie,This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. BAD acting...poor special effects....stupid plot line....BAD MOVIE. Don't waste your money like I did.
4,Very good for the money,"I like that this stroller fits the infant carseat/carrier we already owned. It's easy to open and close, and I absolutely love the drink holder and lidded storage on the handlebar. The only real con is that the rear seat has only 2 positions- laying down, or sitting bolt upright. For most this won't be a problem, but my 2 year old has special needs and cannot sit up without a great deal of support. I use this stroller to transport my 2 girls when I am traveling alone, as it's easier than having one in a wheelchair and one in a stroller. The problem is I have to have my older daughter laying down, which prevents her from seeing anything as we walk along. Also when the rear seat is laying down, the storage underneath the carriage is inaccessible.I don't figure most folks who buy this stroller have the same situation as I do, so I am going to say that for 95% of parents, this stroller is a great buy for the money."
2,Not enough trunk space,"I'm still shopping for a double-stroller and had high hopes for this model. I found it in a store and asked an employee to help make sure that it would fit in my trunk before purchasing it. Unfortunately, this stroller was too big for the rather roomy trunk in my new Nissan Altima. Hoping that maybe the Quattro Tour, which is supposedly 20% smaller when folded will fit, otherwise it may be time to trade in the car for the mommy-van. I can't really speak to the other features of the stroller, but just wanted to share that it does not fit in the trunk of an Altima."
2,Double Stroller Difficulty,Cons:Easy of use very very poor.Cheep constructionNot able to use stroller visors when using baby car seat.Front seat tray is very difficult to open and close.Very hard to open and cloths stroller.Pros:Ligth weightDoes not tip with one child in use.Resonable shock absorbption.May not be specific to this stroller but the design of front back is difficult to turn and dangerous in parking lots. Its very hard to see who is comming without putting your little onse in harms way.
5,I think this is the funniest book I ever read,"This book is just like my classroom, but magical things happen. It is funny."
2,Not what was pictured,"The cart is nice and was easy to assemble , but it had a key difference from the item that was pictured. We have gone through a few racks and found that where the bars that hold the balls are screwed in, eventually gets stripped. We wanted this item because in the picture it shows the bolt going through frame so it can be replaced rather than stripping them."
4,L.A. Ricochet,"A film noir in color, loved the ensemble, Ms.Kindberg has found a way to tell an L.A. story with its twists, turns and California lifestylethat makes me want to explore her career further, worth seeing twice"
4,Straight talk in a world of misconceptions,"In this book Doug Thornburn takes on 118 common and often pervasive myths about alcoholism and alcoholics. Each myth is defined and explained and then followed by an explanation of why it is inaccurate. One of the benefits of the various books by Doug Thornburn is his discussion of ways to diagnose alcoholism much earlier than current, commonly accepted methods. Instead of waiting until the problem of the alcoholic has created financial, legal, or medical troubles he proposes ways to diagnose the disease much earlier. Some of these myths are concepts that continue to conceal the early stage alcoholic and so encourage their progression into latter stage diagnosable alcoholics. Destroying these myths is part of the process of educating others so they can intervene before the person becomes the more advanced alcoholic we are all familiar with. Alcoholism Myths and Realities is recommended for anyone interested in the subject of alcoholism."
5,Biblical response to Domestic Abuse,"Great Book! The authors, using biblical precepts, clearly demonstrates how much God hates violence and how God is the person of a healer for those who have been the victim of domestic abuse. This is the first material anywhere I've read that addresses the issue of spiritual abuse (using the bible or church doctrine to abuse someone). There is a lot of support from the authors if you want to start a domestic abuse support group in your church. A must read!"
5,Best Book on This Topic I've Ever Read,A friend showed me this material because I was leading a support group for women who had been sexually abused. She said she liked it better than other popular books on the subject. I do too. I am now using this book and the workbook in my group. Visit their website and learn more about this wonderful ministry.
5,for your own leadership career,"It is a great novel on leading and mentoring experiences, with a simple prose. It's not a how-to guide, but it inspires a lot of thinking on the Leadership subject.It underlines the differences between management and leadership, and leads you to define your meaning for the word ""leadership"", an ever changing meaning as you run your career.I read it all at once, due to the intriguing story, and 160 pages are not so much to read in a single breath.I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for inspiration and his own way for a leadership career."
4,Fein nail cutting blade,"I'm a high end cabinet installer/fabricator who runs into a different set of problems on every job. I don't use the Fein tool daily, but it often proves to be a big time saver. The ""flush cut blade"", although expensive, usually stays on the tool - it cuts the occasional nail fine, but dulls on hardened assembly screws. (Since it's circular, you just rotate to a different spot until you've worn out the blade).One complaint - I've had two blades overheat and crack when used as a jamb saw in toght quarters on hardwood, even keeping the blade in motion. Admittedly this was with minutes of full depth cutting.The metal-cutting E-cut blades are also good - but, same problem hitting screws."
3,Useful but Pricey,"The Fein tool and associated blades are invaluable for those specialized tasks that no other tool really does well, as advertised. I used this blade to cut out an extra 1/4"" of space around an expensive hardwood floor that was expanding more than anticipated with the humidity. Try doing that with any other tool without damaging the walls, which in my case included travertine around a curved bar.However, the blades wear out quickly and are very expensive. It is too bad Fein won't make them out of bi-metal, or lower their price point. They are missing a much bigger market out there, in my opinion. Use them when you must, but only when you must."
4,Difficult exposition of Catholic faith,"Karl Rahner is considered one of the leading Catholic theologians of the 20th century.Rahner is interesting for several reasons, particularly for his strongly apophatic approach to God. This is reflected in this book, where God is considered the 'ultimate mystery' who is above 'all names', obviously echoing Pseudo-Dionysius.Rahner's style is not the best or the most accessible, and Von Balthasar and Bernard Lonergan are much easier to read. Even Jacques Maritain is somewhat easier to read.Rahner is not incomprehensible, but the reader will find this work very difficult to read unless they have some background to Rahner's thought, especially his extensive use of terms from existentialist and continental philosophy.It remains one of his key works though, and needs to be read by any student of Rahner to understand his ideas."
3,Making the Clear Obscure,"I am new to studying Karl Rahner, but this book is difficult to read, confusing, and if the reader is not very careful, can easily misconstrue the author's intent. Unless you have a strong background in philosophy in general, and German idealism in particular, this book will be a challenge."
4,Wonderful Nightlite,"My daughter loves this bear, it never leaves here side. The story book that comes along with it is could have been better if the cover was a little more studier, but the story is awesome. The only thing I can find wrong with it, is that the bears white curly fur falls off often. Other then that it's great, my son wants one too."
5,It's magical alright!,"My son is 3 months I bought this bear, book and wand knowing that the bear and wand would catch his attention the book not so much he's only 3 months he's not intreastead in story time yet. When he wakes up in the middle of the night I simply turn on the bear with the wand and feed him his bottle while he watches the bear turn colors. It calms him and he easily falls back to sleep after his bottle. I also use this as a night light too...It's excellent. And the wand is even better for those lazy moms who don't fee like getting up or walking."
2,Great Idea but Bear is a bust!!,"First Bear died right away, but company sent another. That bear is now dead too. Sweet story and great idea. Sadly our bears just didn't last!"
1,Broken Bear,"Ordered the Bear for my 2 yr. old grandson. Bear arrived with unfinished, open seam...stuffing leaking out. Now it's a hassle for a beleaguered parent to solve.BD"
3,It serves its purpose,"For the amount I paid I think the quality could have been better, having the adjustable part plastic makes me leary in how many times I may be able to adjust it. It also seems to run larger, which is good, however the ankle support is not what I expect from a roller blade. Non-adjustable ones seems to be more sturdy"
2,Not very durable.,"The pillow is great to just set somewhere and look at, but when it comes to actual use, it won't withstand but a couple months (the stuffing bunches inside the pillow and becomes limp). Also, I think my husband and I may both be allergic to SOMETHING in the pillow. We both developed small, rash-like red bumps that would itch horribly shortly after the pillow arrived. I originally thought we had bed bugs, but after several sheet/blanket washes with no relief, we finally removed the pillow from around the bed (we won't even let it sit on the bed now) and within a few days, we were back to normal."
5,jason's love,I order this for a friend and he said it was great. Came early and in great condition-highly recommend. The story was good too.
1,Save your money,"I bought for my wife who is pregnant for Christmas. I though it would be good for her feet. Memory foam is very thin, The massage is very loud. Not worth it. Save your money!!"
2,Comfortable Slippers- Poor massager,"I was very excited about these slippers when I first got them. After one day, the massaging vibrator in the rigth slipper broke. Even when it was working, the slippers were very loud and hurt my feet. I would have given this product a single star, but I just realized that without the batteries hitting the soles of my feet, the slippers are actually quite comfortable. I would not reccomend buying these slippers, unless you are ready to be unimpressed with the massaging feature."
2,a gift,"I got my husband these for his birthday. I thought it would be great with th mamory foam and the fact that they massage. I was very disappointed in them. They are poorly made, there isn't much memory foam,the massage just viberates the heal. My husband never wears them, plus I didn't like the fabric. SAVE your money"
1,Can I give this product a Negative star rating?,"My feet really hurt and this product makes them hurt even more. I read that they have memory foam. I did not notice they are so stiff and painful. I have size 7.5 womens feet and they are so tight. Do not try walking in these the soles are too stiff. If you have healthy feet they will feel bad soon and if they are in pain they will be worse. Homedics should be ashamed of this product and pull it off the market this is the worst product I have tried yet of any type of anything on the market all categories I think. Socks, Barefeet, thongs or any other slipper or shoe would be preferable to this painful horrible thing. The only thing it might be good for is smashing spiders or using as a hammer when you cannot find yours.I wish someone told me before I wasted almost 20.00"
1,DONT BUY!!! WRONG PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!,"I returned them the next day. These slippers are horribly uncomfortable. Why? Because just underneath a slim piece of fabric is a hard, plastic case for the batteries which are AAA, not AA as mentioned in the description. The reason I bought them was because the thought of having warm slippers was appealing. I didn't realize the only way they get ""warm"" is to place two gel packets in your microwave...then without burning your hands off, take them out, and physically put them into the slippers. Horrid design!"
1,Are you serious?,Ya......my definition of comfortable slippers is having the batteries dig into the arch of my foot.....DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good Product,I really enjoy my slippers. The memory foam formed to my foot for ultimate cumfort. A little bit loud when massaging but still good comfortable and a good product.
1,They don't work well and are of poor quality,"I got these as a christmas gift and was super excited as they felt cushy on my size 9 feet. However one fit my foot, the other one was too big. Strange that they aren't they same size.AS for the massage, it merely vibrates, not that I had high hopes. But the fitting one vibrates constantly at a high rate while hte larger one comes and goes. Since they don't fit right you can't really wear them. Don't waste your money."
1,Dang... Should have read first wish there was a -,"Wore before I knew to use the batteries! Was slipping around soo much. Then when my friend was here told me to try the batter! How SAD & LOUD, what did you say?!!!"
5,Awesome,"My girlfriend got me these slippers for our aniversery. I thought regular slippers were nice to wear. These things are great. I too am wearing them right now. The fabric is just the right softness, the foam is great, and on my feet there nice and snug, keeping my feet cozy, and warm. Only thing is my feet are wide, so sometimes I fall off them when Im walking, but I think that is more my fault then the slippers."
1,Nice mirrow,"I absolutely hate this monitor. This monitor combines a standard computer monitor with a mirror. I can see my own reflection clearly displayed as I am working on the computer. Since I primarily use my computer for work and not to admire myself, it is a big annoyance.Moreover, the monitor was was surprisingly difficult to assemble (yes you do need to assemble!) as the cable cover did not fit."
4,Not as good as the real thing but a close substitute,This product really depends on how sore and sensitive your muscles are. When I first got it I wasn't impressed. Then I tried it last night after being on my feet most of the day and I could barely contain myself as the balls massaged my feet. So its very dependant on how bad your feet need to be worked out. On days when they are fine it will just feel like balls rolling around. On days that you have stressed them it will feel like feathers! The only downside is that you need to be careful with the balls hitting the bones on your feet. I don't have meaty feet and sometimes the balls grind on the bone and that is not pleasant. Overall its one of the best dry foot massagers I've seen on the market and well worth $40.
3,I really wanted to like this product,"I thought that some of the features that homedics had included in this foot massager were novel enough to give it a try. My biggest complaint is that it isn't domed enough in the middle to really massage your instep or the center of your foot. Also it really doesn't take very much pressure to slow the motor and hear it strain. The round balls are supposed to be like thumbs massaging your feet. The heat is nice though mild and not really very warming if you are wearing socks as they recommend. Overall, this is not a great product but for the price it isn't a bad product. I have the Dr. Scholl's foot massager which only vibrates your foot on a round plastic dome. While the vibrating is not as interesting as the ""thumbs"" on this, I still think Dr. Scholl made a higher quality product."
1,JUNK!!! DON'T EASTE YOUR TIME N MONEY:(,"This lasted a whole ten minutes out of the box, it doesn't feel all that good, made of plastic, returning ASAP! :("
2,Motors Appear Weak,"Just tried new foot massager, thinking what a great idea, until you actually try it. Any pressure at all seems to significantly slow down the rotation of the ball bearings. As for the heat setting, it's pretty non-existant, minimal heat at best.I'll probably return it, I'm worried that if I keep it a little while it will break down and I'll be out of luck since the customer has to pay for the shipping to have it repaired."
1,Foot Massager Review,The foot massager is mediocre at best. The 4th time we tried to turn it on - it was broken! Massager will be returned and not replaced!
3,"Pretty good, with some slight implications.","This was actually my first purchase on Amazon, way back in 2007. I used this thing virtually everyday, and it worked great. After a couple of months, however, the balls started to fade from silver to copper, and then from copper to white plastic, though this didn't affect the performance of the product, it did affect the aesthetics and made it less desirable to look at and keep around in plain view.Also after a few more months, the right heat light started flickering on and off.I would say that for the money, I got my use out of it. If you're in the market for a nice foot massager, this works very well."
1,More Foot Pain anyone?,"Yes that's correct, this unhandy little device actually increased my foot pain. I work in a job where I stand 9 hours a day so I was looking for anything that could help.I'll Keep looking.The little balls that 'massage' your poor feet actually just gouge into your heel and forefoot while you constantly try and keep your feet centered on this contraption.HoMedics usually makes little miracle machines however this isn't one of them. 1-Star; returned for refund."
4,Solves the purpose,The massager is much better than the foot spas available in market. It gives relief to feet and the heat coming from it is effective.Cons: Recommended to wear socks while using this. And i wish it was big enough to fit the whole feet instead of only part of it.
4,I'm very pleased with it,"I bought mine a few months ago to help with sore, tired feet. I generally spend at least half my day at work on my feet. I have found that if I push down too hard on the massager it will slow down, but for the most part I have been quite happy with how my feet feel after using it. It's clearly no replacement for an actual foot massage, but does well to soothe my feet after 10-15 minutes of use. The motor seems to do well if you do one foot at a time, or just let the weight of your foot keep downward pressure without too much additional force."
4,I enjoy it!,I've had it for about a week now and it's addicting! I have it in front of my computer and I love how it feels! It feels like someone is rubbing your feet and you can press lightly or hard depending on how your feet hurt. It's well worth the $40 I spent!
3,Decent Product,"You get what you pay for. This thing's not going to grab your feet and do obscene things nor is it feature-laden. Getting certain parts of your feet massaged can be difficult because lacking proper leverage the massager will push your feet around; like when you try to do your heels.The motor pushing the counter-rotating balls is not very strong and can be easily stopped by the weight of your leg. I'm 6'1, 210lbs. If I put the full weight of my leg through my foot onto the massager, it stops. I'm not talking about pressing, just letting my leg rest so the entire weight focal point is the part of my foot resting on the massager.It's worth the price but keep an eye out for something better."
4,Achy feet? This is a great solution.,"I'm a student in Chicago and walking around downtown really make my feet tired at the end of the day. I spend 10 minutes on this thing and the aches disappear instantly.PROS: Affordable. Cheaper than getting a massage at the spa. Very relaxing.CONS: A big machine, not quite portable. Heats up slowly (when in heat mode). Massaging discs too close.TIP: Use this with socks on. Bare feet cause a lot of friction with the rotating plastic surface and is very uncomfortable."
2,Feet slide off. Didn't enjoy it. Returned it,"I bought this at Walgreens and brought it home. At first it was a nice treat, especially with heat.But my problem with it is that your feet slide off. You put your feet on it and the rotators move in a circle and slide your feet off, so you have to use your calf and leg muscles to hold your feet in place over the rotators. Theres no mechanism to hold your feet in place, so you cant relax your feet and legs and just enjoy a good massage."
1,not good,"I returned this item, as it really didn't have enough power to massage hard enough, as I put more pressure on it, it slowed down, so unless you want a tickle, then this is not the item to purchase."
2,a very light touch not a massage,"This machine does only an average job of working the feet. The circular motion of, and the massage points on, the machine do not reproduce the feel of a deep foot rub. The enjoyment comes mostly from just having something to get the blood flowing a little by the light contact it makes. It is definitely better than having nothing and gets by in a pinch when your special someone is not around to rub those pains away, but it is no substitute for the real thing."
4,Great for a foot massage while on the sofa,"Wife loved it, she uses it while watching movies, working on the laptop, playing video games, etc. nicely constructed, good product, nice for feet massager."
2,Foot Pleaser,"I've found this product to be very helpful and beneficial in reducing tension and relieving pain. However, it was obvious from day one that this product is manufactured to sub-standard quality and will not stand the test of time. The unit slows down dramatically when applying a little extra pressure and the motor and/or drive mechanism begin to squeal from the strain. I've found that I can only apply the correct amount of pressure with one foot and not both or the unit will come to a standstill. Once again, overall, the product does provide relief but the quality of the product, including the on/off switch needs to be improved dramatically. The ergonomic design of the product could use some re-engineering as well. The angle of the foot massager is not comfortable when sitting down."
2,Would Not Buy It Again!,"I like a hard massage when it comes to my feet, this machine is rather like several ball bearings circulating around your foot. It tickles more than anything. If you put any pressure on it, it slows down to a virtual stop and the heating part just barely warms up! It's OK if you just like a warm & soft massage but that is not what I was looking for! I would never buy it again. It was a lot cheaper than I have seen in the stores though!"
1,Buy a Wooden Foot Roller Massager instead.,"I'm not sure if I have a different model from the other reviewers, but this foot massager sure is loud. It makes a grinding sound that, at least, drowns out the motor of my desktop fountain. Like other reviews say, I don't feel the heat and my feet slide off the rollers when I use socks, as recommended. I've only had it two days, so don't know how long it will last. Still, at $40, it's cheaper than a masseuse.EDIT: After 7 months, it died. I used it pretty infrequently (once a week or so), and am dropping my rating to two stars.EDIT: Just got a wooden foot roller massager, at about half the price. It won't break, it's easy to use, and you really *don't* need an automatic roller for your feet. You can move your own feet just fine. Dropping rating to one star."
4,Monday,HoMedics FM CR Foot Pleaser Foot MassagerIs a little big for a smaller foot. Heat feels good!
4,Foot Massager enjoyed by recipient,"The foot massager was a Christmas gift. He is enjoying it. The product is working correctly. The heat setting especially is nice. As someone else mentioned in another review, the rotation does lag if you put too much pressure on it, but that is not at all a problem. Just use it correctly. I would definitely recommend the massager to someone wanting a good foot rub!"
4,Gotta Have One,I'm on my third one of these. For the price I have not found anything that will massage my feet like this. I hope these foot pleaser machines are always available.
3,okay,This product was okay. It is not very comfortable when you are seated and getting your feet massaged. In order to keep your feet on the product you have to have your legs set in a certain position in order to keep your feet squarely on the foot rest.
3,"I liked it, but my wife hated it...","Maybe I've just spoiled her over the years, but she did not like the way this unit operated. I liked it, but that could be due to me being a guy and it being relatively easy to please me regardless. One of the things my wife did complain about was the unit tended to ""pinch"" her feet with the opposite movement of the ball wheels. I did notice the balls themselves where plastic with a chrome-like finish on them. Not the most impressive material decision. Overall, I believe your satisfaction will be based on your previous experience with foot massages and your own expectations."
1,Disappointed,"I'm a pediatric nurse and am on my feet for 12 plus hours. I purchased this machine to soothe my poor aching feet. I opened the package with great expectations. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. If even the smallest pressure is put on the machine, it wimps out....no massage, no nothing! I have had much better foot rubs with the manual kind! This machine is a total waste of money in my opinion. I used it twice and it did nothing for my aching feet. You'd be better off spending the money on a reflexologist. Seriously!"
1,Stopped working after 5 15 minute uses!!,"I bought this equipment along with a home medics back massager .. I have used it only 5 times since it arrived last month .. approximately 15 minutes each time .. Yesterday I went to use it again .. the lights came on, the heat came on, but nothing spins .. it doesn't work! ..Now I have to figure out how to return it .. the back massager works great .. no problem .."
1,It is broken after using 3 hours,"I used this massager for about 2 or 3 hours, the motor was not working, but the lights were still on. I have to return it."
1,Foot Massager,"After trying this product, I used it and then went to bed shortly after. I awoke and felt kind of dizzy and like my equilibrium was off. It felt awful and I haven't used it since. It did not say it would do anything like that. I have used products from Homedics before and never had a problem. I won't use it again.Thank you.Claire McDowell"
1,fot massagger,I was screwed by Amazon and did not receive the product I ordered. When I tried to return it I was told I would have to pay shipping. Not going to order anything anymore from Amazon.
1,damaged goods,"The plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner. I was not in the same state when the package arrived so I was not able to open it for over a month...my loss. I don't know if it was not structurally sound, or if the box was just not handled properly. Either way, I've got a dud."
2,Not Satisfied With it,"I read plenty of reviews before buying this and thought it was going to be great. It does nothing for me, isn't what it claims to be. I personally wouldn't waste my money on it if I were you."
4,mmmmm...toasty!,"I put this under my computer desk and it is awesome to massage my feet while I spend too much time online! Without the hassle of filling it up with water I definatly use it more, and it stays clean and presentable so I don't feel like I have to hide it if someone came over and saw it. You use it with your socks on so it stays clean and hygenic. I love it."
1,Great idea - poor quality,"I purchased this item about a month ago from BJs wholesale club. The idea itself is great.. nothing like working from home on your PC while this device works its proverbial magic. The problem however, is in it's lifespan.The device stopped working the first time after a 2 week period. The lights would still come on, but nothing would move. I returned the item and exchanged it for a new one. Another 2 weeks later and the exact same problem has reoccurred. I'll be taking this device in for a refund this afternoon.For an issue like this to happen once- I figure I might just be unlucky and try again. Twice within a month? Too much of a coincidence.Buyer beware. Make sure you keep the receipt."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I bought this product and, like many other customers who have commented on this page, I witnessed the massager die after about twenty minutes of use. I brought it back to the store to exchange it and the saleswoman told me that the associates joke whenever someone buys this that the customer will be back that day to return it! She showed me the yellow stickers that they have to put on returned items before they put them back on the shelves for re-purchase. EVERY SINGLE ONE in the store (Dillard's) had a yellow return sticker on it. Some of them had several. Why these products are allowed to be put back on the shelf, I don't know. There were no less than 20 units that had been brought back. The saleswoman told me not to waste my time. Now, I'm passing that wisdom onto you. Do not buy this product!"
4,Best I have tried yet!,"I just received this as a Christmas gift and I am VERY pleased. I spend a lot of time on my feet, and I love a good foot massage. This is a great product for the times when my feet are hurting from a busy day, or if I just want a relaxing massage. It is so much better than those that just vibrate. I have read the reviews that complain about the rotating balls pushing their feet off, or not being able to withstand much pressure from the foot, and I did not find any of it to be true. My feet rest easily on the rotating disk, and I can easily apply various amounts of pressure with no problems at all. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!"
1,not firm enough,"The foot massage did not do that -massage. It was a very light touch so did nothing to benefit my feet. When I tried to put more pressure, it hardly moved."
1,should have read the reviews first; stopped working after 20 mins.,"My wife and I spent the entire day looking for a decent foot massager and finally bought this one at the store because it was reasonably priced and had the features my wife wanted. Got it home, plugged it in and it worked fine for 20 MINUTES then conked out completely. It died under her feet and refused to work again. Thinking it was some sort of fluke, I looked it up and found this page which contains several other accounts of this product crapping out on the first use. Seems to me a product this shoddy should have been recalled a long time ago and taken back to the lab for retooling.Ignore any other decent or shining reviews of this product. Don't even take the chance. Based on the stats, the odds of this unit breaking down on you are amazingly high. If I'd read the reviews here first I might have saved myself the hassle of packing it back up and driving back out to the store to return it."
5,tidy girls - the annual,This is good music!! Ann and Lisa rock`s! I love it. Bye this and jump all night ;-)line
1,FORE! This stroke misses the fairway.,"Heed my warning and stay out of the rough. This latest effort from Mrs. Pickens should have taken a mulligan and swung again. The ""romance"" is pot-boiler, fill-in-the-blanks, auto-pilot romance writing at its worst. The author of this attempt at romance completely misses the mark with undeveloped, unremarkable characters and a storyline that leaves you out in the cold. Pickens should head back to the country club or take a few practice strokes out on the driving range before attempting another ""romance"" again. This ""Stroke of Luck"" cost me $5.00 and left me frigid.... I think I would have found more heat in a golf magazine and more luck at a blackjack table. Definitely not recommended: did I make my opinion clear enough? ( lol ) There are many better romance writers to read, don't waste your time with Pickens' ""Stroke of Luck""."
5,DEFYING GRAVITY!! BRILLIANT !,"And, defying simple categorization, right to the end. Tony William's last album (?) and in many ways a synthesis of more new beginnings for him - jazz meets the orchestra - neo-fusion - funk - latin - swing - classical. If anything, I was only disappointed he didn't throw in some hard bop - but his own compositional leanings were more toward jazz-rock-fusion, and in some ways that has become mainstream - only because Mr Williams was one of the key innovators of these genre, and we are appreciating his work from a post-Williams, post-Zappa perspective, if you get my drift. Anyway, it's a fantastic album - with great synergy between all players - all giants of jazz!! Highly recommended, along with the Mosaic Select CD of TW's work!"
2,Lacks focus,"Tony is one of the finest drummers the world has known, but this album is pretty much a disappointment from a material standpoint.Sounds very much middle of the road.The supporting cast is legendary, but I just couldn't recommend it, considering that there is just so much better that he has done."
5,A FILM IN MUSIC FORMAT,"This is the Tony's authoral last work, if i'm not wrong.As he said in a 1997 interview to modern drummer, he was very proud with this album. He composed almost all musics. He was feeling himself more mature as a composer. This album is about a travel. Something like an imigrant in the new world travelling across the new land by train. This work is a movie in music format. The arrangement have an harmonic orchestration. For him, one album is a complete history, not a fragmented number of peaces. This songs are linked, musical, peacefull, not a drum show in first plane (this he made as a master in all his life). It's a beautyfull and poetical goodbye from one of the greatest master of the music."
4,Two Tone not as notiable in room light,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She ordered on line with me. She really liked the two tone, but when she opened to make sure it was the same watch, the two tone was not as dramatic as the pictures. Other than that, no issues."
2,upset,I received a four season dvd set that had a defective dvd into the 2nd season. I have contacted the company through Amazon 3 times and I finally got a responseEmily of New Moon Collector's Editionthat told me to contact Amazon customer service who sent my complaint to the person that sold me the set. I am getting the run-around and have found no solution to my problem. The dvd has a huge gash on each side so I was not able to watch the series in order. Mainly I am upset because I have not been able to resolve this.
5,Emily of New Moon,"Loved watching Emily of New Moon. I loved Anne of Green Gables, my favorite of all favorite movies. Emily was good and keep me wanting for more but I wish the ending was better, but overall, I really enjoyed watching all episodes. The characters were all so good!! Wish they would have continued more episodes!"
2,Disapponted !,"Being a big ""Anne "" and ""Avonlea "" fan i was thrilled to find another Montgomery series on DVD. After reading several reviews i agree it is a little ""dark"" and sinister feeling in some bits. The young characters are at times quite rude to their elders also. I bought the whole collection and was disapponted;several episodes on the double sided dvd's could not be accessed and in several other episodes it would jump and then freeze. It was very frustrating to not be able to see the whole story line unfold. I looked forward to ""Anne"" and ""Avonlea"" with anticipation after each episode. Unfortunately this left me cold!"
5,Great!,"This was the greatest series of Emily of New Moon. I am 54 yrs old and could not stop watching the videos. I wishthere was more on her life after she got older. You need some where she goes to high school, college and her lifeafterwards. Just to see if she goes back to New Moon to live out her life. Thanks, it's the best...."
5,Emily Of New Moon,This Canandian series is very good. A little bit like 'Little House On The Prairie' (Pioneer age). Young orphan girl living with relatives she didn't know prior to her parents death. Spunky little girl with a gift to see ghosts on rare occasion.
5,Excellent family series.,This is a fun and entertaining series to watch and discuss as a family. The characters are interesting and developed well. My only complaint is with the DVDs for season three and four which are two-sided. The last episodes on the second side do not play correctly. The picture freezes up and jumps around while the audio continues uninterrupted. This was a terrible disappointment. Be sure to check your copy before you've had it too long to exchange.
5,"Delightful, entertaining series",L.M. Montgomery is one of my favorite authors and I've read every book she's written. I was pleased to see that Emily of New Moon had been brought to life. It's authentic and follows the books. Excellent choice.
3,Emily of New Moon Collector's Edition (Spoiler caution),"I bought this elsewhere. I am glad this is not based on a true story. We liked some of the episodes. I gave it a 3 because the shows writer needs to do research on cats & coons. In one episode the cat & coon get into a fight. Which I know this is not true for fact. The only time a coon would attack a cat if it was hurting their young and vise verse. The reason I know this. I had two stray cat that get along fine with the coons & one was even raised by a coon. I am not kidding. We saw it rubbing the coon. Racoons & cats get along fine.Another reason for a 3 star, they never wrapped up who really gets New Moon property after every adult dies beside Emily. (I know who got it in the book but not the show, since it basically two different stories)"
3,Love the stories,watched on television so had to purchase all the seasons......dissapointed with labels on the dvd's...no way to tell which dvd is which.......no where to mark myself either.
3,Emily of New Moon,Strange subject matter for this author------I don't know if it would be ok for children under 12. It is a little dark at some points.
2,CD Missing,"The set arrived promptly, but one CD was missing out of the 8 that were supposed to be in the box.I sent the set back and I was promptly sent another box, but there again, a CD was missing."
3,Emily DVDs,"Since I had just reread the 3 Emily books, I was perhaps too excited to see the DVDs. My anticipations were that they'd resemble what I had just read. The DVDs were too mystic, tragic, and had such modern themes (like agendas from the producers)...so very different from the books. That's why I'm slightly disappointed. I like fact I could get all the seasons in one volume of DVDs however."
5,"Wonderfully Written, Fun Adventure","My children loved the characters Penny and Polo. Once I started reading it to them, they didn't want me to stop. The balloon adventures are cleverly written. Great, witty reading for children as well as adults."
1,A verty dull and boring experience,This book has to be one of the worst books I have encountered in my long and distinquished reading career. There is no worthwile inner meaning or message and I would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Absurdity and the horrors of war,"Wharton's book taken most likely from his experiences in the military is a little bit uneven. There are a few flashbacks and forwards that pop in without warning. Yet the book is hard to put down.The story is of Sgt Will Knott and a squad of ""intelligence"" soldiers stationed forward of the front before the Battle of the Bulge. They are a misplaced group trying as best they can to outlast the war. When the come upon a squad of German's trying to surrender they learn about the real absurdity and chaos that warfare is. It's a strange book but I'm glad I read it..."
3,black demi cup,the glaze was not even they look like second they dont even have the fiesta stamp also the black jumbo cup didnt either usa dishes should have made in the usa
1,Looks great but has stopped working twice,"I have had the battery replaced but the watch has stopped working again. It looks very high end and feels solid, if it worked it would be great."
5,great product,I use this product on my kids. You know that brown stuff that accumulates on kids necks and sometimes behind their ears no matter how much they wash? This will get it off!
3,Makes skin soft!,"I read in a magazine last month that this product helped to reduce blackheads and in turn, make pores less visible. Unfortunately, I do not find that to be the case. I use this product daily at night after I scrub my makeup off for the day. Even though I bought it to reduce the size of my pores, I do like how soft it makes my skin feel. You mix a little bit of the powder with water and it creates a sort of thick paste that you rub in circles on your face for a minute. The result is wonderfully soft, clean and glowing skin. So, while it does not seem to be helping my pore problem (at least YET), I will continue to use it daily because it really leaves my skin feeling and looking great. I will not be purchasing this product again because it's a bit pricey and is not helping like I had hoped and read that it would."
5,The best face exfoliator and cleanser,This product is amazing - it is a powder and all you do is put a little water in your hands to mix it then scrub your face. Your complexion will appreciate the the rosy clow and clean feeling!
1,Leica UV filter,"A UV filter for any lens defeats the whole purpose of buying an expensive and very well designed lens.It is for the most part useless, However, if taking pictures on a windy beach or rainy day or maybe smokey places,a protection of that valuable lens may be very worthwhile. The main reason for getting a filter is to protect that lensfrom soil, shock and possible breakage. The best performance of your lens will always be when it is naked.Exceptions to that rule is for use of polarizers and ND filters to get certain effects needed.If you must have that extra piece of glass on your lens, let it be the same make as your lens."
2,Have seen better Quality with pirated DVD's,Sound poor - images grainy - resolution of titles/cast were extremely out of focus. I've seen better quality camera captured movies - perhaps this is one! I had never seen but enjoyed songs from the soundtrack. Ordered in hope that soundtrack recordings would be as good as CD sound track - Sadly disappointed!
4,"excellent, really informative - enriched my traveling",Prior to visiting the Dominican Republic I'd heard alot about the all inclusive holiday camps that operate there but didn't know m uch more. Our three week trip traveling around was therefore preety enlightening. We took a couple of guide books but it was this one we came to rely upon. It deals with everything we needed & went alot further interms of advising on appropriate conduct & giving context to the living standards we'd see & reassuring on safety. I would Thorougly recomnended this guide for the republic - it added to an enjoyable & very different trip by giving insight & saving us alot of time.
1,A sorry excuse for a guide book,"I have used this book as a guide while travelling around in the Dominican Republic by car. While I can fully recommend doing so, I would not recommend using this book as a your travel guide.Often we found inaccuracies or even misleading information, particularly when travelling outside the charter tourist hot spots. We were often sent on wild goose chases by the so-called guide book. It is also often lacking in detailed information about the location of interesting things/places to see, so you could only read about it, but not locate it. Consistently we found the quoted prices to be wrong - sometimes actual prices were more than double the quoted prices (the book had been finished 1 years before we travelled, it was in the low season and annual inflation had been less than 5 per cent, so there is no obvious explanation for this)."
2,"Good for some practicalities, not much info on what's there","This book is for people who want a bare-bones listings of accommodations and a couple of restaurant recommendations for every town. There's very little information on the countries themselves in terms of culture or history, and almost nothing on what there is to see when you get there. This doesn't mean that it's a bad book, but you should not expect it to point you in the direction of something interesting to see that you wouldn't have known about otherwise. I feel like there are other books on the market that do a better job of that. But I didn't find inaccuracies in the book and it might be a helpful tool for those who already know the Dominican Republic and Haiti well and just need a quick reference on where to bed down for the night, get their bearings, etc."
5,great performance,"with this album, haris alexiou did one of the best in the nineties for greece! superb performance, wonderful lyrics and the music, composed by nick antypas, is more than just greek music, it's world spirit and balm for every soul! evcharisto, haroula!"
5,Harris Alexious- the Goddess of Music,"Harris Alexiou- One of the best singers world-wide. I suggest that you also offer the rest of her excellent albums. Some of the titles: ""To Pekhnithi tis agapis(The game of love)"" ""Girizontas ton Kosmo(Getting round the world)"""
4,Classic Greek With A New Age Twist,"Starting with the first track, Haris Alexiou grabs you with her modern sound along with her classic voice."
4,Ruskins Art Teaching,"Collingwood constructs a view of Ruskins ever shifting thoughts on art. His work addresses the shifting intellectual positions of Ruskins and the influence of modern thought on his positions. Religion is also a major topic in the book, which is almost unavoidable given Ruskins strong religious convictions and those of people (including Collingwood) of the time.As Collingwood points out he expects his readers to have read a number of Ruskins detailed works on art. I have read only Stones of Venice, Elements of Drawing, and at times found it difficult to follow the line of thought.Not a light read and it does require considerable concentration but well worth it to set aside much of the modernist/ post modernist position as sophistry."
4,Crossing to Safety?,"This novel is about two couples whose lives have been intertwined for years. One of the wives is disabled by illness/age and the otheris dying of cancer. It is NOT a downer, however. The cancer-sufferer becomes a sympathetic character despite the fact that she hasbeen trying to control the lives of friends and family for years. It is a slow, contemplative book, perhaps Stegner's best. I know nothing of his personal lifebut he appears to be writing from the heart here. I recommend it for those who are old or are planning to be old."
1,The worst book I have ever read,It was a nightmare to read this book. The premise of a boy meeting a cheetah seems interesting but the book makes it the most boring story ever. First it is so slow; you read chapters and chapters and nothing happens. The boy escapes and runs and them sees a tree and then another tree and so on. Then he meets the cheetah but the rhythm never picks up or the story goes anywhere. I read this book in class and everyone including the teacher shared the same opinion. This is a terrible book. Parents: if you want to buy this book as a present don't! You will only push your kids to the Playstation.
3,didnt last,"this was such a good sponge. soft, extremely absorbent but it lasted about two months and was in pieces. so maybe i didnt do all the special care etc e.g. soak in baking soda every now and then etc but even then, two months is a pretty short time for a ten dollar sponge."
4,Bath Buddies Natural Bath Sponge,"Nice sponge, Very soft. Good size for toddler. Good price. Only complain, had some black little things in it. Otherwise is nice."
3,Very cute but uncomfortable-buy them for style !!,"The shoes look very cute, and fit ok, but are very uncomfortable to walk in. They fit ok even for wider feet (like mine), but aren't great for long wear. I have only had them for a little while, and maybe they'll get comfortable over time, but I don't think they'll ever be very comfortable. However, if you get them on sale, they are definitely worth it because they look so good, especially in unusual colors. I have green ones and they look very nice."
2,Difficult to understand,"The concepts explained in this book are very difficult to understand. It has been selected for a course in economics at MBA level and the concepts in the book did not help at all to write the paper. The examples are not very clear and very confusing. I am not majoring in economics, but this book did not help me to better understand the topic."
3,"Good textbook, but dry reading","Unless you consider reading textbooks to be fun, this will be a pretty dry read. The book presents many macroeconomic concepts in a relatively easy to understand way. If you've ever wondered about national debt, GNP, GDP, trade imbalances, or currency exchange rates, go read wikipedia. If you STILL wonder about those things, pick up this book."
1,Poorly Written,"This was one of the worst text books I've read. The flow and structure is lacking and the calculation examples provided don't correspond to the formulas in the text - making it nearly impossible to extract applicable uses for many calculations. Fortunately my professor provided extensive lecture notes.If you are able to do so, I would pass on this book...not worth the money."
3,Bed Lounger,"This is another present that I bought for my husband for Christmas..and he didn't like it. So now I am using it..and I like it much better than any other lounger I have used. BUT the head rest offers NO support..it just bends backwards unless it is leaning up against a wall or the bed head rest. Other wise, it is great. Good support. Like the way you can tie the two arms together when not using it because it is large.Haven't tried to wash it yet."
5,Don't miss this one...again,"Rate it 10 stars! I missed this one in 1987, and finding it now is truly a gift. Tom Verlaine has never been stronger vocally, lyrically or instrumentally, with superb backup by Fred Smith, Jimmy Ripp and Allen Schwartzberg. On first playing, the songs synched right into the grooves worn into my brain by repeated listening to TV's Marquee Moon when it first came out, and pushed me right over the edge into euphoria. Listen to any one of the cuts, and see if it doesn't send you there, too. Try ""Cry Mercy, Judge,"" and if that doesn't quite do it for you, move on to ""ATown Called Walker,"" ""At 4 A.M.,' or ""Annie's Tellin' Me."" Dancing on the edge of perfection...guess the friends who worry about me when I tell them Tom's lyrics make perfect sense to me can start worrying again! Don't miss this album--one hearing and you'll be ""falling in love again...can't help it."""
4,its simple to follow,"My friend recommended this book highly and she recommended a great new beverage that replaced my morning cup of joe. Caffeine made me too jittery so I switched to a soy-based coffee that taste simply amazing. When I use my percolator it comes out with a rich, full bodied taste. Search under ""S oyfee"" on google to find it."
5,Buy it!,"My teenaged daughter swears by this stuff! Like the other reviewer said, if you feel a pimple coming on, use this a few times, and the zit will not come up. Worth $22 for her self-confidence."
5,Magic pen,Dries out and gets rid of most blemishes within a day or two. Put it on at night and it works like magic.
1,Expensive and not that great,"I got this for my father who has advanced Parkinson's and he doesn't even use it. It was way too expensive for a cheap mug that is basically weighted down. It doesn't help him at all and was a waste of money. It may be useful for someone else but ask them if they think it would be beneficial before purchasing, and I'm sure you can find this mug cheaper somewhere else."
1,just waste my money and time,"I thought it was a great book but....., now I am very sad. I do not think the author knows enough about C++. If you want to confuse C and C++, and write some awful codes, get this book."
3,Review,"I like the watch, it's just a little too big for my smaller wrist. i have one other Ecko watch, and it has a large face as well, but this one is bigger still. like i said, i like it, but for anyone who has a small wrist, you might want to take note of the face size. also, compared to my other Ecko watch that i really like, this one lacks slightly in quality i think- it doesn't seem constructed quite as well(the links are kind of flimsy/has more of a plastic feel). i expected the watch to be a little heavier, for it's size. as always, if you can get your hands on this product before you buy it, that's where you'll get your best review!"
3,It was Ok!!!,I purchased this watch thinking that it was going to look like the pictures boy was I disappointed!!! not only did it not look like the pictures when I took the watch out of the box it was dead as a door nail so I sent it back for a refund
2,Rip out the first chapter....,"...and the book is better. But, it still has flaws cause the theory many places doesnt stick. Apparently Miles is the ""big boss"" at the table. A title you get when you dont trust your partner. Prebalancing has never been winning bridge, so why make a book about it?Still there are some useful modern conventions in this book, so its not totally useless. First time when I started to read it, I put it away and thought about throwing it. But, at least I have to admit its better than that..."
4,Raunch,zZz is a Dutch Rock 'n Roll band. One of the first to sound refreshing and meaningful. Dutchmen were never to known for there great Rock 'n Roll artists. For good reason. Who really remembers the Golden Earing of the Q-65. You shouldn't.zZz (pronounced simply zzzzzz) is refreshing for two reasons. First they sound like a raunchy crossing between Jon Spencer and the Doors. And raunch is always a good thing in Rock. Second they achieve al this with just a basic drum kit and an fifty dollar organ. You know the type. Grandma has em for her church song. Never intended for the Church of Rock 'n Roll. Effective none the less.Oh Yeah... zZz is probably good to get laid on. You can dance to it. Girls like that...Girls got something men like. And that is also a good thing in a Rock 'n Roll band.
1,Batteries die within a few minutes,"As far as laser pointers go, this has to honestly be one of the worst I've ever had. The batteries die within 5 minutes of usage, and it takes button cells so it WON'T be cheap to keep refilling the thing every time you want to play with your cat. Go get yourself a GOOD 5mW laser pointer that takes regular batteries and isn't made out of cheap plastic like this one is."
3,movado watch.,"I LIKED THE SERVICE VERY MUCH. MY ITEM ARRIVED AHEAD OF THE SCHEDULED DATE. THE ONLY THING I WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT WAS THAT THE WATCH I PURCHASED THROUGH THE NET DID NOT COME WITH THE SPARE LINKS FOR RESIZING, WHICH ALL LINKED WATCHES USUALY DO. SO I HAD TO PURCHASE THEM AFTER."
1,Picture is completely misleading--do NOT go by it!,"The picture shows a white ceramic double spoon rest. It's clean, attractive, and what we wanted.The actual item is a stainless steel, metallic item that will scratch anything it comes up against. Absolutely a travesty that the photo hasn't been fixed.This is going back, but now we won't have the item we wanted as a Christmas/houseguest gift.Plus, while Amazon makes returns easy, they are still a hassle, taking time, packing, mailing, etc."
3,Picture is deceiving,"This item's picture appears to be a brushed stainless steel, but it it very shiny and on the light weight side. I'm disappointed in comparing the photo with the actual product received. Over time, the wear will show. I'm still on the hunt for a heavy weight brushed stainless steel double spoon rest."
4,"OK summary, but cluttered organization","EU law is a big subject to cover, and this book does a decent job. Unfortunately, I found the organization to be a bit cluttered. For example, Folsom throws EU sources of law together with discussion of EU agencies in the same chapter. Also, there are a few catchall chapters that cover everything from competition to environment. It would be better with more chapters and headings to make it easier to find information."
5,An intimate look at death by a theologian and pastor.,"This book deals with the fact of death on an intimate, personal level. Paul Smith illustrates that a death is as individual as a life. His skill as a pastor gives us insight into ways we can help loved ones face death. His openness in describing the feelings he went through while being ""in the moment"" with dying friends is of benefit to any who are faced with the death of a loved one. And the way in which he frames death, as an integral part of life, is of benefit to all who seek wholeness in their own soul."
1,Euthanasia,"This book is not about the inevitability of death -- it's about euthanasia, the killing of those who are ""supposedly"" terminally ill. It's a book about letting humans make a decision that righly belongs to God. We all know of people who have lived when the doctors predicted they would die. All the platitudes and distortions of Scripture espoused by this author will never overcome the obvious truth that none of us have the right to kill another, even if that person is weary and ready to die. Leaving that to God is compassion."
1,If you like margarine,"I bought this from my local supermarket two different times about a year apart. I wanted to make sure I didn't get a bad batch or something.I will never buy this again, It tasted like margarine and made my toast a nasty yellow color.If this is what the Irish really call butter I feel sorry for them, cuz it's wicked nasty.I tossed it right in the trash."
5,Kerrygold Buter,"My taste buds are well groomed and accustomed to good flavor. Kerrygold butter is the absolute best I have tasted in the last few decades. At one time I bought it at Amazon, but it's now carried by Costco, Sam's Club and Trader Joe's...and at the latter for $2.69 per 8 oz package just a week ago. Save some $ if you're able."
2,Hardly makes a difference,"I accidentally put several surface-y scratches in my brand new stainless steel sink. It is a very high quality stainless, so I'd expect good results but just did not see them. I applied this product exactly as directed, but did not see much difference at all."
2,Variable Quality,"These are our dog's favorite treats, or were. They are usually light brown, with a distinctive ""gamy"" aroma. I ordered eight (8) bags, and received seven (7), in three different shipments. I assume that they came from different suppliers. The contents of two of the bags was very different from what we've always gotten in the past. The treats were dark brown with a decidedly acrid smell. The dog won't touch them - they seem somehow fermented. We are now reluctant to order, since we can't be sure if we'll get the ""good treats"" or the ""bad treats."""
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!,"Sadly yet ANOTHER [stinky] compilation that LOOKS like it could be good. Of course - just like ""best o' boingo"" most of the songs are lifted from the ""BOINGO ALIVE"" album - so - those of you hoping for the original EP version of ""Violent Love"" will be sorely disappointed when you realize it's the live version.Skip this piece of [junk]!"
1,"This CD does NOT contain the real version of ""Violent Love""!!","These budget-priced alleged best-of CDs are motivated by pure greed - if you're really a true fan, why would you buy this? You already have all these songs already. The label KNOWS this, so they cynically try to FOOL the fans by stating that ""VIOLENT LOVE"" - long an early fan favorite from OB's early 10"" EP that's long OOP - is included here on this CD - buy after buying it, you'll feel the burn when you discover to your horror that it's the inferior ""live"" version - what is the POINT? MONEY. Plain and simple. A waste."
3,Certainly not for real fans,"Heck, all of the songs are good on this collection. The glaring omission of ""Ain't This the Life"" made me do a double-take. Any real ""Best Of"" Boingo would require a double CD (at least). But, if you are a Boingo novice and wpould like to listen to a small sampling of some of their more commercial stuff, knock your self out. Then go buy ""Nothing to Fear."" Moreover, buy ""Skeletons in the Closet"" if you really want a good ""best of"" album."
3,"5 stars for the music, 3 for the compilation","With ""Best O' Boingo"" still in print and offering six more songs than this abbreviated set does, this CD has no reason for existence other than to fill a slot in the label's ""20th Century Masters"" series. Both this set and ""Best O' Boingo"" substitute inferior live versions when songs were originally from the band's first albums for the IRS or A&M labels. At the moment the Amazon price on ""Best O' Boingo"" is the same as for this one; there's no reason to bother with this if you're determined to buy the entire CD."
2,If you agreed with Pres Clinton's handling of terrorism ....,"Mr. Daalder was a believer in ""limited missile use"" and that's what we got from Mr. Clinton regarding terrorism. And, like Clinton, he believes we need the United Nation's approval, which is apparently what Mr. Clinton also wanted and never got; thus, he let them tie his hands in really addressing the threat. There may be a different solution than that posed by the present administration, Mr. Daalder's is not the way. And by the way, neither the Brookings nor the Center for American Progress, of which Mr. Daalder is also an adviser, are non-partisan. This is a fiction."
1,Just like the Warren Commission: Complete and total BS,"My title should say it all. This book doesn't even make any attempt to look at any contradictory evidence (which there is a great deal). Nothing to see here folks, just move along."
3,A BIT LESS THAN EXPECTED,"The unit shipped as expected was packaged a bit flimsy.I opened it up tyo find it was an older model that had been relabled as a new model unit,however lyman assured me that was common place ,I still have my doubts .Finaly got around to using it it is slow and a bit lackluster in performance (ie... 28 hours to polish moderatly dirty brass) which I blame more on the media than the unit so i have since replaced/suplemented the media with stainless pins and ceramic cylinder2mm makes a huge difference but none of these things are per mnfct recomendations so i do not know if it voids my warranty or no ,also i decreased capacity"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK - Avoid this rip off,"Bought this thing expecting a miracle. Did not expect a piece of junk. It's cheap flimsy plastic (why not anodized aluminum for a $240-$300 device like this?). It TURNS OFF after every scan (absurd). It TURNS OFF while you are DOWNLOADING pictures over the USB cable (ridiculous product design).You also have to specifically buy san-disk brand mini-sd memory or it will not work. I had a nice Kingston piece. Did not recognize it. Nice to let people know ahead of time.Sorry, this thing is pretty much a rip-off. How these guys get away with this junk is probably BUYING OFF Ziff Davis PC magazines and relying on the lazy folks who do not return this broken-by-design piece of junk. EASILY THE WORST DESIGNED, WORST QUALITY ELECTRONICS DEVICE I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO WASTE MY TIME AND MONEY ON."
2,Not ready for prime time.,"Purchased this item last November and have yet to get a decent scan with it. While it is small and light it suffers from an inability to control the scan. Along with that limitation is the fact that no matter how good you are at moving the scanner down the page the output is distorted in practically every case. Also, the software hoops necessary through which one must jump in order to get a workable product is daunting.The idea is great, but the product thus far is not ready for prime time."
2,Appears it hasn't improved...,I purchased the Planon DocuPen Pen Scanner directly from the product's website a couple of years ago for someone at work who I provide admin support to. The item that arrived appeared used and was slightly scratched in some areas. I did not use the scanner very much but found that it was not very easy to maneuver while trying to scan; I also agree with it being poorly made.I'm currently looking for a handheld scanner that will allow me to better scan bulky items such as textbooks...I am glad that I read the reviews as it appears the product isn't being made any better today than it was two years ago.
2,"Nice try, but nearly useless for even basic scanning","I bought the Docupen to do one thing and one thing only: to scan text in books to avoid having to use a flat-bed scanner and stress bindings to get full page contact with the platen. However, it's nearly useless for that. Unless the page is perfectly flat (that ais, NOT in a book) it's impossible to move the Docupen evenly down the page, and even scanning from the gutter to the edge didn't help much. If the page is at all curved, forget it. In addition, the pen slips even when when scanning single pages on a flat surface if the paper is calendared (""glossy""), The bottom of my junk drawer is the Docupen's home now.I didn't expect miracles when I bought this, and don't really care about the clunky software, the wonki controls, and the other weirdnesses that the other reviewers have mentioned; I was willing to put up with all of this as long as I could get a decent text scan in the end. Can't do that, though.I wasted my money."
1,Wasted a bunch on this pig.,"Well, let me be the first to admit that the stick will scan some things fairly well. But most of the time, it is just a pain in the... well I don't use it any more. I worked in the oil and gas industry and occasionally had to do title research at various court houses. Since the ""scanner"" isn't wide enough to scan an entire page, I tried to use the stitching software to allow me to scan half a page at a time...nope, didn't work. With the state of the art digital cameras available nowadays, this item is obsolete."
1,Defective out of the box~,"Behringer Active DI Box for Guitar GI100. The one I purchased is defective out of the box. Unfortunately, I didn't get around to using it for a couple months. Either/or both the input from guitar or output to mixer feed is defective. I get direct signal link out, but nothing from guitar to mixer. Checked and double checked my wires and feeds. Behringer has yet to respond. Made in China."
3,For the price it's OK,"I mic an acoustic guitar using a SM57 near the soundhole plus a cable out from the guitar to an acoustic xciter, chorus pedal, flanger, volume pedal and then into a Behringer mixer along with my vocal mic. From there I run a line out to an input of a small 30 Watt Fender Acoustsonic amp which I use as my monitor. From the amp's line out I run a cable into the ULTRA-G GI100 and from there to the house mixer. It works fine as it fattens up the total sound somewhat before reaching the house mixer. The only negative side of this is the way they made the battery compartment. It takes about as long to fit the battery in as it does to do my whole setup. Surely they were asleep when they designed the battery compartment. They should look at the LR Baggs Para Acoustic DI if they want to know how the pros make a workable battery compartment."
1,bad product,"i connect it with my acoustic guitar to a pa during church service, here and there i have to go to the snake unplug it and replug it in to get the signal, and yes, it loses signal after a little while."
3,Ok for cheap active DI,Ok at best. The guitar cabinet feature on these adds to much noise to the signal to be of any use unless you are trying to simulate a very noisy mic'd amp. Slightly better than some of your cheaper passive di's but does not compare to several brands active di's (Countryman or Radial).
3,Works for me.,"this unit works the same as the other ultra DI box for signal processing. it is very quiet, has a lot of options available, but the guitar cabinet simulation is very, very underwhelming. The V- Ampire modeling in the LX1200h head is a whole lot closer, but this box does a good job at a really cheap price. If you need high quality guitar tone, play through an amplifier."
2,Preliminary review...Can't turn music off and on!,"I just received this and haven't actually played the games yet so this is a preliminary review. It opens with a screen of 6 (yes, only 6) games to choose from. When you click on one it loads into a game such as tetris, spot the difference in pictures, etc. Within each game there is NO options menu. They all have extremely annoying music which you cannot turn off!! I rarely, if ever, want the music turned on for any game I play so that option is very important. I like to hear the sound effects so turning down the speakers isn't the best way to go.The games look like they might be challenging but the interface is lame. Not being able to turn off the music may deter me from playing at all, we'll see. I will expand on this review later. Date: 3/13/08."
1,Death By Deception,"I can't reveiw this product because I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET!!! WHERE IS MY PRODUCT??? I ORDERED THIS BEFORE CHRISTMAS - IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BY NOW. I AM ONLY PUTTING ONE ""STAR"" ON THIS REVEIW BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T LET ME SEND IT WITHOUT THAT ONE ""STAR"" - BUT I WOULD HAVE NOT CHECKED ANY STAR IF I COULD."
5,Another page turner from Bud MacFarlane!,"The follow up book to Pierced by a Sword is just as good as the first. MacFarlane, through his characters, accomplishes the impossible: he explains faith to an agnostic. If you ever wanted to know about the connection between religion and basketball, this is the place to find it!"
3,Bud re-read your own book please,"I think that perhaps Bud should re-read his own book. His insights on marriage seemed to be so on the money, his characters learn to sacrifice in order to save their marriages. Now Bud himself apparently has walked away from all he taught, while he still makes money off people who believe his previous message. The message of the book is still valid, the author apparently no longer believes it. He now believes, according to quotations from court documents that such an attitude towards marriage is too conservative. Too bad, so sad, maybe Mr. MacFarlane should go back to marketing or better yet go back to his wife."
5,Change your understanding of God,"This book is a must read for any catholic, or anyone who is looking for understaning in their own life. This book opened my eyes to a whole new world of spirituality."
4,A Novel to Bolster Up Your Catholic Faith,"My fiance Dan passed this novel on to me since he enjoyed it very much. I was at first skeptical as to whether or not I would appreciate it as well, but was pleasantly surprised as the characters were revealed and the plots thickened.This novel made me think and re-evaluate my faith in the Catholic Church. At the end of it, I was inspired to take steps to deepen my walk and relationship with the Lord.The characters represent me, you, and those around us. The feelings, situations, emotional highs and lows that each of the characters go through are those that all of us experience one way or the other.I heartily recommend ""Conceived Without Sin"" to all Catholics and non-Catholics alike. God Bless!"
3,be careful,"The frame itself is okay, however 2 of the 4 I ordered arrived with small dents and dings. Would not order again because of that."
3,OK but limited,I found this cutter to be OK as long as I didn't ask too much of it. It will cut 2 sheets of 8x11 card stock full width but not 3 sheets. If I increase the pressure between the cutting edges by pushing sideways on the handle performance improves. I bought this cutter to replace a sliding knife cutter used to make business cards and it has reduced the time and effort required.The handle which is removable for shipping and storage comes off too easily while the cutter is in use. A positive catch would be useful. I acknowlege this is a low cost tool but I believe there is a difference between cheap and inexpensive. The performance of this tool could be greatly increased with a minimal production cost by a design change and material selection geard toward improving the stiffness of the cutting bar. Hence only 3 stars.
2,Blade was dull,I returned this item because the blade was dull and would not cut even one sheet of paper evenly. The first few inches of cut was acceptable then the paper just tore. I was very disappointed.
4,Cuts mattboard!,"I love this cutter!!!! I've had my cutter for more than a year now. I like to make books and need to be able to cut mat board from time to time. I didn't want to have to keep going to my local Hobby Lobby to have them cut this for me every time I needed a particular size. Now, I just go to Hobby Lobby pick out a 32""x40"" sheet of mat board and have them cut them into 12x12 pieces for me (and they give me the odd pieces if I ask for them). I have all the mat board I need for quite a while. I go from paper to mat board back to cutting paper again. I use the grid lines to line up my major cuts. It would be nice if it had a ruler at the bottom. But, I am very pleased with it. I wouldn't trade it for the world! Clean, crisp, straight cuts every time. Still as sharp as the day I first bought it."
5,I LOVE IT!,"This paper cutter is fantastic. Cuts clean and straight, and straight is wonderful, after using my old one for 5 years. I recommend it highly!"
4,love it,Looks just like the picture. Came in really fast. The only reason I have 4 stars is because the magnet clasp is a little weak can't put more than 1 card in each pocket (2 pockets and one clear id holder) and the cash part can't put much in either. The magnet being weak might be a good thing though reading reviews on other products magnet cases messed up Spen this one hasn't. I do love and recommend this case though.
3,katrina update,"this is a fine book with much helpful info, however it needs an update since the hurricane left much of the data obsolete."
2,"Worked well, and then...","This started out as a great idea. The remote worked really well for several months. About 6 months in, I noticed that it was having a hard time unlocking the car. I changed the battery, and it seemed to work better for a couple of weeks. Now, 10 months after buying this, it won't unlock the car and will only rarely open the trunk, though it still locks it just fine.While at the auto parts store the other day, I tested it on their tester. It appears that it's not sending RF signals on the non-functioning channels. I have no idea how that could happen, but I'm quite disappointed in the remote now. Nothing more than a keychain, almost.I'm planning to see what the distributor will tell me. If they make well, I'll update this."
3,A superhit Woman Cop Drama,"Tejaswini starring Vijya Shanti, an action packed crime and police drama is quite engrossing. It is well directed by N. Chandra. I just loved the performance of Vijya Shanti."
2,Not Ideal for All Hair Types,"Contrary to the claim, this Spray shine-on is not ideal for all hair types. I have fairly curly ringlet hair...and frizz galore...so I've become something of a frizz expert and I'm here to tell you that this thing doesn't minimize the frizz much if at all. They claim it gives a serious shine...and yes...it gives some shine...but I didn't see anything miraculous to write home about. It just made my hair feel like I was adding build-up. You would be much better off with the Alterna Rapid Repair Spray...the price is 3X...but so the payoff is even more than that."
3,"Not really ""USB 2.0"" - fair otherwise","I expected the ""Hi-Speed"" version of USB 2.0 when I saw the ""plug and play USB 2.0 direct connection built in"" thing in this item's information - but I was dead wrong. They are using a technicality in the USB 2 spec that allows them to refer to USB 1.1 speeds as ""USB 2.0 Full Speed"" - it's a USB 1.1 device in everything but name , and thus 40x slower than a real USB 2.0 ""Hi-Speed"" device.That said, the MP3 player is at least functional, and it has more bells and whistles than the equivalent player from Apple (backlit display, FM tuner and voice recording). Haven't had any crashes so far - if I did I might try a firmware update when Centon offers it. If you can handle the USB 1.1 speeds, and especially if you have gift certificates or a discount, this would be a fair - not great - choice."
2,Really disappointed,"This woman had an incredible voice that could melt people across time. Sadly, the versions on the selections here are TERRIBLE. If you like Nina, look elsewhere. There are also major gaps in the selections; ""Angel of the Morning"" isn't included, but a miserable version of ""Everyone's Gone to the Moon"" is? I may return it because of the version of ""Trouble in Mind"" alone. Great singer, lousy selections."
5,Evergreen,E' un cd che bisogna avere nella propria collezione.Da riascoltare in qualsiasi periodo. Resterà sempre bello.
2,My taste,"I have been a big fan for many years, but was disappointed in this album. It just was not my thing."
4,cool book!,"I love the Left Behind:The Kids series and I liked this book too. The only thing I don't like about this book is Nada (if you look at the reviews it's pretty much unanimous-she stinks!). I'm really writing a review for the whole series-it's GREAT and I would recommend it to anyone who's willing to try it. I do recommend that you read the books in order, though, because if you miss something it can get confusing."
3,"Well, I liked the others better...","...Nada is the only reason I gave this a low rating. if she goes, mine will shoot back up to 5 stars...it's a pretty good book, though not my favorite(But, hey, if I'm gonna read the series, I have to read the latest, even if it makes me want to throw up)...Lots of suspenseful situations. Good, even with Nada, I suppose..."
4,"Nada,The Horrible","This book is really good with the exception of Nada.I HATE NADA!!! she,s (in my opinion )not a good addition to the Young Trib Force.And I can't believe that Judd could like her.She's too weak.Anyway since i hate her I won't spend so much time on her.i really like vicki.I wish they could trade Nada for chaya.In my book it was supposed to be Vicki and judd!!!!"
4,A classic Viet Nam Era adventure,"In the pages of this realistic book, you can smell the languid stench of a Viet Nam jungle, the sweat of broken spirits and disillusioned men. That unforgiving fog is ultimately infused in the acrid smell of politics and intrigue in Washington, DC.The author's crisp and polished prose depicts a world known to few. A hapless GI returns from Viet Nam to find himself entangled in a government search for a fellow American who has defected to the enemy.Is it true? What were the circumstances? Where do we go from here?These and other ever so humane realities of duty, patriotism and personal responsibility are deftly woven into this fast-paced story.A quick read and a good one."
5,Terrific 'Nam Book,"Mr. Grosso has written a terrific Vietnam -era fiction book, based on his own personal experiences in country. The interplay between the Vietnam battlefield and Washington politics; interwoven sagas of U.S. soldiers, foreign nationals, and civilians; sizzling battle scenes--you can hear the helicopters chopping; all capped by an enduring message for enlightened readers, make this book a must read for all interested in 20th century military history."
5,Classic Sci Fi with a message for today?,"This review is for the Sturgeon short story, not the Asimov cover. (It is a double, with the 2 stories backed-to-back in a paperback.) I first read The {widget},The {wodget}, and Boff many many centuries ago. Even then I knew that it said something important about the human condition, and that that was it's intent. I was too young though to really get it. Twice over the years I've tried to find it, and finally, thanks to Amazon, I now own my own copy. The setting for the story is dated, as are the social strata depicted, but the real message is not. It is a very short read, but one of Theodore Sturgeon's best."
3,Two styles that never mesh,"This book reads as if it were written by two people who never talked to each other. Two stories -- one with great prose and characterization, very readable. I can guess who wrote that part. The other boring prose, tedious plot, and unreadable -- after I while, I just skipped those parts. I have never read Silverberg before, and I am not going to, after this. The 3 stars are for what I think is Asimov's part."
2,"Proof positive of the ""character problem""","I've read that Isaac Asimov denied the existence of the so-called ""character problem"" -- the lack of well-drawn characters -- in science fiction. This novel is proof that he was wrong. The characters are stereotypes from the '50s. The business and social formality depicted was probably current when Asimov wrote the short story in 1958, sadly dated as the novel was written in the '80s, and a ludicrous extrapolation for the future setting.The problem is exacerbated by an apparent lack of editing. Perhaps the combination of two famous names led the publisher to skip any serious editing. Maybe nobody actually read the book before it was set in print -- how else can you explain gaffes such as taking ""a long deep sip"" of a drink?The combination of clumsy storytelling and bad writing turned a decent, though dated, short story into a dismal novel."
2,Bonds of Iron,"A small group of men and I are going through this book right now. It's just OK. Not great. A bit too much psychology for me, and not enough Biblical/Spiritual application for my liking. It does have some interesting insights. The ""Take Action"" points at the end of each chapter are challenging in some ways, but not as relevant as I would have hoped."
5,It works for TV!!!,Less than a week usage and TV starting to majorly fade. This will be a lifetime user for me!!!
5,ultimate sound,"this is the first cd i purchase from this artist. no regrets he is a genius artists i give it a 10 star rating if i could. this is classic salsa music.,"
2,Microsoft Virtual PC for Mac 7.0,"Good news, it works kinda. bad news Sucks up huge amount of memory, is too slow and doesn't work with DVDs and it crashes (like most PCs). Granted my Apple may be short of speed but if you need a PC to run programs you can't run with Apple, try something Apple will support like boot camp or maybe just use a PC"
1,you have GOT to be kidding me,"I don't know what these people are doing who are able to get this absolute piece of junk to work!! I have never seen such a waste of money. Two hours of fiddling with this amaturish program and I STILL cannot get it to install a program. Jeez!! How in the world can a company continue to sell a product that barely works for half of the people who buy it?!?!?! I thought, oh, I have a brand new powerbook, I am computer literate, I can make it work even if these other fools cannot. What a mistake....I should have known when the easy install booklet was 63 pages long that there would be a problem. I am going to uninstall it, reinstall it, see if I can get it to work. But, you know, that is exactley the thing that I have time to do - mess around with an incompetant program that keeps crashing.At $200 for Virtual PC plus an OS, maybe we should all just buy a $500 computer if we really need this stuff to work."
3,Be careful!,"Before buying this product, MS Virtual PC for Mac 7, make sure you have a Mac OS that this software works with. I thought I had researched this carefully before I bought. Microsoft's web site states the System Requirements are: ""Apple Mac OS X version 10.2.8 or later; Mac OS X version 10.3 is required for the Power Mac G5.""However, MS Virtual PC for Mac 7 does not work with Mac OS 10.5 or later. It installed on my Mac just fine, but it would not read the CDROM drive, so I could not install Windows on it. If you're running an old version of Mac OS X, it appears this software will work for you. Otherwise, you'll have to do like I did, and return the product."
1,windows on the mac,It was my mistake to purchase Vitural PC for Mac 7.0. It will work but it is so slow. If only one would step into the world of Apple they would never go back.
3,Virtual PC for Mac,"Once installed, VPC worked OK. But ... running Windows apps on a Mac G5 using VPC was painfully slow. Had some issues getting virtual printing to work right.After two days, something failed and the Mac hard drive would no longer boot. Mac had to be taken in to the shop for repairs. Unclear if this was related to VPC."
2,Ugh! I'm saving my money for Mac software,"I made the switch to a Mac G-5 OS X about 13 months ago. I added the Virtual P.C. 7.0 on my Mac, because I had some Microsoft only programs that I could not afford to replace in the Mac equivalent or didn't have time for the learning curve.I am on a 80G hard drive with 512 mb of ram... so it's a pretty powerful machine.The Virutal P.C. 7.0 is ""o.k."" It does what I need to do and that's about it. The software runs about as good as it does on a p.c. (and that's not saying much). It's slow, printing is horrendous (don't even bother printing from the Virtual P.C.) and crashes just like on a p.c.I think Microsoft would have done better to create Mac versions of their software (like they did with Office) (i.e. Frontpage and others) rather than try to pacify Mac users with Virtual P.C.I give it about a 5 out of 10. It's o.k., does what you need it to do if there are no other options, but other than that, I'm saving my money for Mac software.. (i.e. Dreamweaver)"
3,Question,"Can anyone tell me how much history is a part of this book? Is it predominately about the rescue of the Republic, or is it balanced out with a substantial amount of history? How does it compare to ""Raising the Hunley""?"
5,More tales and more fun!,"My daughter and I enjoyed this video even more than Volume 1. We love the simple background that welcomes viewers of all ages to the small African village to hear Nandi share tales with music, art, and dancers. Her African dress also adds flavor to her exciting storytelling.This is a must see for children of all ages. As you laugh at the stories and sway with the songs, you will certainly enjoy it!"
5,"Short, yet profound discussion of the Lord's Prayer","In this book, Chemnitz steps through the Lord's Prayer, petition by petition, and does what he does best: provide data(other Bible passages, church father quotes) and thought-provoking examples. And LOTS of them. While this work is very short, it is dense in thought. A book that is not meant to be read, but studied and meditated upon, working through the passages and studying their contexts. At the end of every petition, Chemnitz asks the reader to take what he said, and reflect on the prayer with 4 questions. If you take the time to digest Chemnitz' words with prayer and meditation, you will take away a lot on the Lord's Prayer. Highly recommended!"
