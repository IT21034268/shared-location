4,Good Knowledge...,Important knowledge for anyone aspiring to reach a higher consciousness. I recommend this book and check out others by Isreael Regardie as well.
5,Foundations of Practical Magic,"This is an excellent book but not for the rank beginner. The language style makes it harder to read but for those who have studied other materials, the information is well worth the effort."
4,Delivers on promise,"This is the best floor cleaner I have found so far. Our wood floors in our recently purchased home are not perfect but this product does a nice job cleaning them. It's not going to make the floors ""brand new"" if they have gotten the wear like our floors have but it does clean them and doesn't leave any residue. I had been using ""swiffer"" type products and this product is a LOT better."
1,difficult to use,"the microfiber mop head drags across the wood floor, as opposed to using a terry cloth mop head cover that glides over the wood floor."
5,Armenia is still waiting for justice respect these War Crimes!,"The genocide of Armenians through the story of a family who live in Armenia and that, expecting the arrival of certain relatives from Italy, restore a house (The lark farm) in order to give them shelter. Unfortunately the WW1 makes its appearance and will avoid this encounter materializes itself. Besides, they will witness how their distant relatives will be implied in this horrible genocide through the Turkish rebels.As always, Taviani brothers have built a superb film, supported on a magnificent script and splendid perfromances from all cast. Paz vega, Moritz Bleibtreu and Angela Molina shine by themselves in their respective roles.What will it have been the reason for this film has been totally overlooked in 2007? The answer keeps unresolved.Watch it. It's a stunning masterwork and certainly, one of the top twenty films of that year."
2,a cinema lover,"unfortunately, ""the lark farm"" is a corny rendering of a serious topic that would deserve better. I also wish the product information had told me that, while the title was in english, the movie was actually in italian with only english subtitles."
3,Eager,"I am very much interested in this book,Howeverthe problem is to get the book in India,Hope my problem can be solved very soon byinforming me about it's availability in indianbook market,or any same type of book availablein indian book market,So that I will be soon able to give review onthis book."
3,Horse_Racing_Bigi,I want to type a review but my immediate problem is how do i buy this book.Please advice
1,Don't bother,Unit totally malfunctioned in the first 2 week - HOT water came out of both taps and the entire water bottle was heating up.Documentation/user manual has diagrams for a different model.Another family member bought the same model and the compressor went out in the first month.POS... don't bother.
1,Defective Unit,"I had the exact same problem as the other reviewer. The unit overheated and scalding hot water was coming out of both the hot and cold taps. The water is the bottle was also steaming hot. I called customer service and was told they don't repair these units and would only replace it if I had my original receipt, which I don't. This is a defective product I would rate it lower if I could"
3,recommended by my doctor,"This book was recommended by my doctor after my cholesterol came back a bit high (I'm sure it's genetic). There is a lot of good information, but the recipes don't look terribly appetizing to me."
4,WHeAtuS++,"This is true modern rock. The everyday painful innocence of youth and the gut wrenching butterflies of emotion are set to modern light thrasher rhythyms by this band from Long Island, New York. They have the power of angst with perspective. Vocals are audible and cool. Bass and percussion are strong, but not overpowering."
1,Booooooring...,"This is the worst romance novel I have read in a long time. There's enough plot to fill MAYBE a hundred pages, but it drags on for almost 400. The rest was fairly boring dialog, during which the characters re-hash already established arguments over and over again. Action? None. On the rare occasions that events actually happened, they were unrealistic in a contrived, unimaginative sort of way. Plus, we're supposed to beleive that there is real passion between these 2 characters when it takes them 365 pages to do anything but kiss? I also found the characters unsympathetic and one-dimensional. The father is such an idiot, and does some really awful things while meddling, but is forgiven immediately with a slap on the back and a ""Well, you meant well."" Overall, a complete waste of time. Don't bother."
4,Small town romance.,"A fast, entertaining read. Bobby is a sweetie and in a rare twist he's not ""Mr. Macho"" as so many men are in books. I loved the way Jenna stood her ground in regards to her fathers business. What an absolute jerk her father was-he should have been pushed into the Potomac! He had no fatherly instincts at all! Jenna sure showed him!"
4,fun read,Read the trinity harbor trilogy and wanted more. This was a fun book that made me want to be a part of the character's lives. Always enjoy reading her books
4,Ask Anyone Review,I would recommend Ask Anyone to anyone who enjoys Sherryl Woods books. Her characters come alive and hook you into the story line. Makes you want to read the other 2 books in the trilogy.
4,trinity harbor series by sherryl woods,"enjoyed all three of these books. they are lite reading with happy endings. just the thing for a quiet relaxing read on a hot summer day. since i read to relax, this series fit the bill."
5,enjoyed the book!,"I enjoy Sherryl Woods' books, so decided to try ""Ask Anyone"" (Trinity Harbor). It is a good read for anyone enjoying fiction without all of the intimate details of life!"
1,Poor quality,"Some people reported that ""water literally pours out of many spots on the hose. This creates flooding instead of soaking"". I totally agree. It happened to mine too. First time I turned on the water, I saw at least 4, 5 holes that water shot out as far as 3-4 feets. Over a week, I saw more and more holes!!! This really a piece of junks. Some one may think that because my water source may has too much pressure! No, I have a water pressure gauge that reads only 42 PSI which is low to nornal pressure. Comparing to the hose I bought at Walmart for only ~ $8, the Walmart's one is much better!Be aware! Don't buy this hose."
2,Soil Soaker Holes are TOOOO Big!,We have several soaker hoses and this one has inordinately large holes in it whereby it looks like a fountain when you are using it rather than a gradually dripping soaker hose.
1,This is a FLAT soaker hose,"While this is 5/8"" wide, and is a soaker hose, it is flat rather than round, and less than 1/2"" high. The seller did immediately refund the purchase price when informed of my dissatisfaction with the product."
3,Hvae seen better qualitiy soakers,Its not letting the water as my old one but it works Just takes longer time.
1,2002 ways to cheer ......,This book was very repeatively. It should be entitled 200 ways to cheer yourself up in an efford to avoid repetition.
2,"A short, exciting adventure","An adventure in a feudal Britain, where Mr Bayard (the same of ""The Worlds of Imperium"" , appears in passing. In K.Laumer parallel universe logical often lacks, but fun is assured."
3,Science made magic,"A parallel worlds novel, one of a series of four set in a common setting of the ""Imperium"". Being an old-fashioned hard science guy, the elements of mysticism woven into this story were for me distracting, but I believe most modern readers would have the opposite complaint - that the magic isn't magic enough. The hero is whisked out of normal life and sent off to travel between parallel universes trying to correct a great imbalance in the entropic forces in order to avert an apocalyptic disaster. Much of this story is very similar to Robert Heinlein's ""Glory Road""."
1,Failed to mail expedited book,"I ordered a book from ""Heroic Image"" On August 29 and used Expedited Shipping. I needed the book asap and within the 2-4 days and payed extra. I received an email on Sept 5th there was a problem. I notified the owner and she told me she had been out sick and no one was there to replace her so they were way behind in the orders, ""sorry"" and would I like them to ""try"" to locate the book. Now 8 days have gone by!!!!! Can not believe it. So by the time they would locate the book and have it shipped it would be over 2 weeks. Absolutely not. I do not trust this buyer and would not use them again! I understand that problems may arise but would have appreciated them contacting me the next day rather than waiting over a week.Merchant name: Heroic ImageItem(s) to ship:Name: Introductory algebra and trigonometry, (Addison-Wesley series inintroductory mathematics)Qty: 1 ASIN/ISBN: B0007DTXPI"
5,Go for it!,"What a book! ""If Pinot Noir is a poet who whispers in your ear by firelight, Grenache wears a black leather jacket and picks you up on a Harley""...Get it? Now you know which one would be best for your mood tonight. The beauty is that you discover why the wines are different while having fun.If you think a wine book has to be intimidating and super-technical, don't buy this one. It's about learning and discovering the world of wine without pain. The anecdotes, the self-deprecating attitude, remarkable humor and superb writing make this book an absolute must for everybody who is not a snob. BUY it. You will savor it."
3,No Better than L'Oreal,"I purchased this after a friend stated how much she liked it, but I found that it was not as ""volumizing"" than the L'Oreal mascara I'd been using. It wipes off cleanly with a cleansing cloth."
2,Thought I loved this eyeliner,I thought I liked this eyeliner for the first couple weeks. I liked the small brush for getting the corners. I still went back to Dior mascara after using this. I highly recommend.
2,"Not up to normal Lancome standards, wont buy this online again","I love Lancome Definicils mascara and have used it for years! I was lazy and went online to buy it instead. It was the same price as I pay at the make up counter in the department stores so I went for it. But when it arrived, it was the WATERPROOF version of the product which is not what I ordered. No where in my order process online did it mention WATERPROOF. So the product was wrong. And it was a bit dry compared to the nice new and fresh ones I get at the local stores so I think it had been sitting on the shelf for a while. Anyway, I will not order this again online."
3,"It's ok, but not great","I used to use Lancome products exclusively and got to the point I couldn't afford it. Maybe the cheaper (L'Oreal, Cover Girl, etc.) have gotten better or this formula changed, but it's not as great as I remember it - especially when it's three times the price of other mascaras.If you already have full lashes, it does a nice job of separating them, but not much for lengthening or thickening them."
5,Definicils mascara,"I have used this particular mascara for quite some time and find it to be the best. So many other brands tend to be clumpy. I do find it to be very important to make sure it is fresh, and for that reason, I am especially pleased that Amazon has a program for recurring shipments on a schedule of my choosing, which is every other month. I don't have to remember how long I have been using the current one, and there is a discount for signing up for recurring shipments!"
2,Disappointing,"I was a huge fan of a mascara called Accentuous. Astonishingly, L'Oreal took this gem off the market several years ago. Since then, I have wandered from one brand to the next trying to find something, anything, even as remotely effective. When I read on a blog that this product was made by the same company and was, in fact, the same product in a different package, I quickly and eagerly made my purchase.It is not. sigh.Lancome DEFINICILS High Definition Black Mascara is just like any other mascara out there, but worse in that it is:-too expensive-too small a quantity-too 'quick drying'. contents of the bottle dry out too quickly necessitating more frequent purchases of said product and moreover-difficult to apply without forming clumps because it dries too quickly on the lashes which makes it difficult to control its application.I gave it 2 stars b/c yes, it is a mascara and works like a mascara and yes, it is black."
4,My favorite,"I really like this mascara. I only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and I have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out. Otherwise, it is the only mascara that doesn't cause me to loose a ton of lashes. Everything else from Estee Lauder, Bourjois to Great Lash causes me loose a lot of lashes. I also like that if I cry, I don't wind up looking like a raccoon, it subtly melts away; no mess! It washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible, not flaky."
1,Lancome Mascara,"The mascara was very dry and I am sure old. I used to be a Lancome Business Manager and this product obviously has been sitting in their warehouse beyond its usable date. This is to no fault of Lancome, they have a fabulous mascara, undoubtedly due to the company that warehouses and resells the product."
2,No big deal...,"I bought this mascara after reading so many great reviews, but I found it to be mediocre at best. It's no better than anything else I've used. Too much money for something that just doesn't do a fantastic job. I've had drugstore brands that are much better."
4,great!,I have pretty much stopped wearing make-up because so much out there irritates my skin and especially my eyes but this stuff is really nice. The brush is perfect and lest you apply a little or a lot depending on your preference! I wore it for a day with no red eyes or itchy black flakes on my face! really great!
5,A really nice HDTV for games and movies!,"I bought this 200lb beast for $1199 from Crutchfield, free shipping and they even install in your entertainment center! I actually bought it after I returned a 32"" Westinghouse LCD (which cost $150 more). The Sony CRT looks great with DVDs and awesome with my Xbox 360. The LCD looked unbelievable with my 360, but there was slight lagging with fast games like COD2. The Sony looks about as good, with perfect tube performance. It defaults to 1080i, and I guess I wish that I had the option for 720p, but oh well. It has an HDMI input, so it'll take full advantage of the upcoming PS3 and Blu-Ray. It even looks good with regular cable. Highly recommended for gamers and movie buffs if you don't mind it's weight!"
5,"If you dont own it, you have NOT seen what HDTV can be.","Do you want to see what HDTV is REALLY like? Forget all the noise about LCD and Plasma sets, because in order to sell those things, the vendors have to hide this baby in the back. Someone mentioned this in another review, so I went to Best Buy, and the sales person confirmed it before I had even seen this Sony in action. They dont put tube HDTVs on display in stores because the picture is so superior, nobody would buy the more expensive flat screens. I had seen lots of HD material before on friends flat panels, but when I got this sucker home and hooked it up, my jaw dropped. It is brighter, clearer, sharper and more vivid than you can get from any current flat-screen technology. You flat panel owners are getting ripped off, because you are paying more for a lot less if picture quality is your main consideration.Buy it!"
4,Nice program if u know what it's for,"A-sketch 9 is a good value for the $$. It is NOT an illustrator program, it is for drafting, and if you don't understand drafting conventions get something else. Most of the specific complaints posted other buyers are invalid and caused by their own misuse. I found it intuative, complete and versatile. The improved layer system is a major plus, and it comes with a bigger built-in library than I expected for the money. It won't do 3-D and (sadly) doesn't have a perspective view capability. But hell, it's only a hundred bucks....."
4,Nice upgrade to QuickCad,"For me, this was an upgrade from QuickCad (also by Autodesk). As a QuickCad user, switching to AutoSketch was a snap. All of the menus are similar, drawing conventions are the same, and it has the same ""feel"". I found the changes to be improvements in the interface options. Layers can be turned on and off from the drawing page rather than pulling up the layer window. There are better templates for starting a drawing.I use this program for drawing up furniture plans for my woodworking hobby. I found that programs like Autocad, although powerful, were difficult for me to become proficient with limited use. AutoSketch does have a learning curve, but I found it to be a short one and easy to remember how to use between projects."
3,AutoSketch-9,"I think that the program is good. I find it somewhat hard to use, however my assessment is quite unfair in that I have been using AutoCAD-2000. The difficulty lies in ""backing up"" from the premier software to software understandably not as capable. There is another learning curve to navigate."
2,VISTA,i have Vista on my computer and im having trouble installing it.....i havnt had a chance to get online to see if theres a patch or fix for my problem
2,an uninspired conan tale,"This title is perhaps one of the weakest entries in the Conan series. The book plods along at an uneven pace, and far too much time is devoted to developing secondary characters. The book, however, is not completely devoid of redeeming qualities. Carpenter's knack for characterization shows through although at the expense of the action many ""Conan readers"" are accustomed to."

3,Not so sure,"It was okay, but the microdermx I used is what totally changed my skin around to beautiful skin."
2,This product didn't work for me,"I bought this product hoping it would be a way for me to avoid botox. Well after using it several times and followed the directions, I didn't notice any improvement at all. I feel somewhat cheated because this isn't cheap and I read about it in InStyle. Save your money!!!!"
1,Save your cash,Freeze 24/7 was a huge disappointment. It did tingle but I didn't pay $150 for a tingle. There was absolutely no improvement on any part of my face other than a very slight pore refinement. I tried it for several days in a row. When I didn't see any change I tried it on just one side of my face to see if I could see any difference. There wasn't any. I didn't expect it to look like a face lift but I did expect to see some reduction of the very fine lines around my eyes. This product is a total waste.
1,DON'T BOTHER!!!,Was extremely expensive and completely worthless! Saw absolutely no results at all!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1,dissapointed,"This product did not perform for me. I use olive oil based cleansers on my face, so perhaps my products are not compatable with Freeze 24/7.It caused a bit of a rash overnight on my forehead, and it took three days before my skin recovered.I passed the product to a friend and after trying it, she tossed it out.We both felt it was a shame that such an expensive product was so underwhelming in it's actual use."
2,Put your money toward the real thing,"I bought this product a fews days before going on vacation and it gave me really bad headaches And I had the weirdest dreams...I know this sounds strange but it was like I couldn't relax my eyes so it was hard to sleep right...That's why I gave it 2 stars because it definitely was doing something...but it made me too sick and I wasn't willing to go thru headaches, as soon as I stopped using it I slept like a baby and was back to normal..."
5,freeze-24-7 great product,"I'm 36 yrs old & have had tons of sun exposure, therefore I have many wrinkle in eye area & under-eye circles. This product has worked great for me at this stage in my life. I definately can see reduction in wrinkles & that's worth the money for me. I will purchase this again!!!"
1,Not sure it works,"I think this is one of those products that after you spend that amount of money, you want it to work so much that your eyes deceive you. I'm not sure that it works."
2,It did something but it wasn't good,"This product did not make my crows feet and frown lines go away, but it did do something I can't quite put my finger on. I know this because during the few days I used it, I had several people at the office tell me I looked tired and run down. I'd never gotten those kind of comments before. I stopped using the Freeze 24/7, and the comments stopped."
5,Freeze Wrinkle Cream does do it!!,"I purchased this item from this seller after reading about it in the NY Times, to see for myself if it worked. After reading the instructions, I tried it and seems like right after I put it on, a lot of my fine lines disappeared or didn't look as deep.I also recommend the Freeze Prep & Polish. It gave my face a very taunt & shiny look. Thanks Freeze!"
3,Slow read,Lots of good facts on who gets killed but slow read for me as the story centered around days of killing in one of the hardest fought areas of Okinawa.
4,pretty good overall,"Finally, an all instrumental album from one of the hottest bands in bluegrass! After seeing them recently in concert I couldn't wait to get my hands on this recording. It did not disappoint, for the most part. The picking is phenomenal all across the board, with taste and musicality taking presidence over pure hot licks. However, some of the tunes really just don't do it for me. They feel kinda dry. That being said there sure are some golden moments. Jeff Taylor has some great accordion solos that surpass his work on the Charleson live cd. The star of this recording, in my opinion, is Cody Kilby. I've never heard such a full, driving, clean sound like that. There is something about the way this guy plays that just makes the group sound fuller and drive more when he solos. Its an instant change. Favorite cuts: ""Crossville"" ""Goin to the Ceili"" "" ""Wayward to Hayward"" and ""Polk City""."
5,Great Music by Talented Instrumentalists,"This is my first and only venture so far into bluegrass. Attracted by watching Skaggs Christmas show, decided to venture further by buying one of his CD's. Taking chance on this latest of instrumental offering, not disappointed at all.In fact, I find myself listening often, and liking more and more each of the eleven offerings. Doesn't matter to me if not all is pure bluegrass, enjoy the accordian, clarinet, strings, etc. The blues rag song is terrific as well as the Celtic sounding ""Crossing the Briney.""These are certainly fine musicians on their instruments who play wonderfully together, with their turns at jamming, or whatever it's called in bluegrass. In any case, they've got a new fan."
5,Loved it,I bought this cd a few months ago and it gets better each time I listen to it. The musicians are top notch. I love the celtic feel to some of the songs. It doesn' get much better than this!
3,A stretch,"I like Ricky Scaggs a good bunch. However I wanted to hear bluegrass instrumentals not a grand orchestra. The CD starts out strong but there are cuts that I can do without. Sorry Ricky, I still think you are the bee's knees!!"
2,album was lame,"Sorry, didn't like it. His Live at Charleston hall album is great. But this one was lame."
2,Range is greatly exaggerated.,"The manufacturer claims elsewhere (not on Amazon.com) that this product allows the user to reach targets up to 45 feet, which is totally untrue. Actual effective range is 20 to 25 feet at most. In addition, it leaks slightly from the pump handle during operation."
3,Chapin Industrial Sprayer 6002,"Works up to 25ft, spraying. Also slight leak near handle when pumping.Did an OK job pumping liquid."
1,"What A Rat Race, Even The Title Tune Is Incomplete!","This set is sooo cheezy, even the title tune ends before the music & singing finish up! What basement did they find these things in? Bob and His Majesty must be hurling thunderbolts down on those who put this out! Smite them, Jah!"
4,One of the best voices in the business.,"On ""LIVE IN CONCERT"", Midge hits the stage to promote his PURE album and showcases a plethora of crowdpleasers for the Manchester Apollo faithful. The man must have a very good set of lungs; I'm sure there's plenty of pop-pretenders out there these days who would balk at singing VIENNA on stage in its entirity. Midge is in top form on this album. It misses out on five stars because there were a few notable song ommissions and a weak sound from his guitarwork. He can obviously play the darn thing - with a Thin Lizzy pedigree - however this aspect of his music has never been fully realised. Nevertheless, ""LIVE IN CONCERT"" is a worthy addition to a Midge fan's collection."
4,Hot single,"great first single for a new artist. Myself and my friends find ourseleves listening to nazty girl all the time. Keep making new stuff, this single is hot"
4,great knitting guide,I don't knit - but my wife does. She has had this book on an endlessly renewed loan form the local library for over a year. I have searched every book shop -real and virtual in Australia - many listed it - none stocked it - Amazon had it.It HAS to be an indespensible guide to knitters everywhere - grab it while it is in stock!!
3,Harmony sititch books in different format,"What is important for the serious knitter is to know that this stitch book is a rehash of the older Harmony knit and crochet stitch books. One of my books had 440 stitch patterns alone. So with just 900 stitches about half of which are for knitting and the other for crochet, you are not getting the total of all the Harmony books together. However, each stitch has a helpful name to it and they are grouped into like categories. The color pictures are tiny and there are no charts but there are good top subtitles on each page and also at the sides. The index is also a useful feature and the book looks sturdy with good print and binding. The aran stitches and fair isle stitches are lacking from this edition. There was one Harmony book just on those stitches so worth hunting around for that one to supplement this."
4,good book,"This book is excellent for people who know how to knit and crochet and don't want to be constantly buying patterns. There are tons of patters organized by yarn weight and use. The book gives info on how to knit and crochet however, it is weak in terms of pictures which most beginners need."
1,Not his best work,"I am a long-time fan of Eric Newby since stumbling upon his 1956 book, A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush. I actually fell off the couch laughing. In addition to the adventures of the trip, Newby offers an inside look at Afghani geography, history and culture in a very readable form. Gently Down the Ganges, by comparison, I found monotonous and dreary, almost whiny. I strongly recommend Newby for his self-deprecating, dry ""British Traveler"" wit but cannot recommend Gently Down the Ganges as the best of Newby."
1,Useless as a squirrel call...,but works great as a dog call. I have used this numerous times and have yet to see or hear a squirrel respond to it. My dog comes running when I use it though.
3,Good Story,"The idea of the story is very well though of. There is a lot of depth to the character's and their history that proves the author's ability to write. This book also includes very good scenery descriptions that make you feel like you are in Scotland with the characters. The reason why I rated this book so low is because..well..not much HAPPENS. It wasn;t one of those books with an intruiging plot so that you just can't set it down. I would pick it up every once and a while just to see if it would get better, and it didn't really pick up till more than half way through the book. I good read, but nothing that you can;t miss out on"
3,Beautiful writing,"This is a puzzle: although this book was beautifully written, and makes me want to go Scotland, something didn't click for me. The premise is great, the characters are fine...maybe it is a bit overwritten, with too much description and not enough really happening. Maybe a bit too much ""naval-gazing""... I think a strong edit would have helped a lot. But I can see that this is a book where this opinion could well be a minority. This new author seems to have great potential and I'll definitely read his next book."
5,Responding to Literature: Version 4,"This book was everything the seller said it was, and it has been a good text book. Everything I wanted to know about the book I was able to find out prior to purchasing it."
2,Typical Chilton's manual,"This is typical of a Chiltons. Very long on warnings concerning handling antifreeze and motor oils, then falls flat on it's face in the index department. I have not yet figured how to find anything in the index. And the comments driving you to seek help from a dealer are not what I bought the book for. I KNOW how to change oil and plugs, what I needed was help in troubleshooting a transmission problem. And there was no help there. To me, not worth the 17 bucks"
2,Bites off more than it can chew.,"There are hardly any pictures of where exactly things are. Also the BMW 2002 single barrel carb is quite a different machine than the BMW M6. Unfortunately the ""manual"" attempts to cover all models at the same time.They would have done more of a service if they had made more detailed manuals on each series. My 1969 BMW 2002 Owner's Handbook (with US suppliment) is more detailed than this ""manual"".Don't buy this."
2,"Hard to read, navigate, archaic","The chilton manual is difficult to move through, everything from having no real index to lacking page numbers altogether and relying on strange chapter-like organizing. There's no fuse specifications for the 3 series (must have been a typo, I hope, because anyone who would intentionally leave this out deserves to be shot) which is example enough of how many shortcomings this book has. If you can, find another book because for the beginning mechanic looking to learn how to work on their BMW, this book aint gonna cut it."
2,Barely useful,"We've got an '81 633 CSI, ostensibly covered in this manual. With an ignition problem, this manual was useless -- it simply didn't provide any means for diagnosing a pickup coil problem for any model (you'd think that they'd list what the output specs are for the signals).As well, with a stuck e-brake, they don't cover the specifics of our chassis.The wiring diagrams are a little useful, though there is no thought in covering the stereo.The upside is, there's not much competition -- AllData doesn't seem to support BMW."
1,chiltons bmw copes and sedans,"How the hell would I know I still haven`t recieved it yet,any ideas on when hmmmm!"
1,This movie rotts,"You must be kidding if you want to see this movie. ""Zombie 4"" um no, it has nothing to do to Zombie(Dawn of the Dead),Zombie 2, or Zombie 3. Its called Virgin Among The Living Dead. Oh yeah, it is CUT! Oh boy. Lets just say there is a good 21 minuets cut, plus lots of parts are blacked out so you cant see people doing it. The pictures on the box arnt even from the movie! Comon, its so chopped up for American release. At least Zombie Lake isnt cut, dispite the fact that the director shot parts for both movies and even had some of the same cast members. Well if you like your movies cut than you should be pleased with this one.Oh yeah did I say there is no gore what so ever in this film. Nope! like I think one person dies and thats it. And the zombies are only in this for like 20 mins.oh well..."
2,"Virgin among the Living Dead: Fairly funny, but not good","Yes, I admit that I own this film. I picked it up at a trashy video store way out in the country.Overall, I found this film to be confusing and fairly annoying.It has some funny parts, though. Like the keeper of the mansion. He has some sort of speech impediment, which makes his speech extremely odd. I know it ain't PC, but it's funny as hell.Some of the forest scenes have artistic merit, in my opinion. One such scene looks a bit like the cover of the first Black Sabbath album--minus Ozzy. There's also a scene where the main character looks quite goth.Unfortunately, the end of my copy of the film cuts gets all fuzzed out. Probably from a bunch of crazed Rednecks watching it and continually rewinding it in order to spank off to the last scenes or something.I wouldn't mind seeing the uncut version.If you have it, please let me know.Thanks,Lorenzo McReynolds"
1,"With the title""Zombie 4"", shouldn't we see zombies?","I hate to give a bad review on a zombie flick, however Zombie 4 was a disaster. If the movie was under another name, it would be better off. A person who buys or rents this movie wont be a happy camper. I compare this to Halloween 3. People wanted Micheal Myers. Instead they saw a different movie. If Halloween 3 would have been under a different title everybody would be happy. This movie is the same example."
2,If you into Gothic and Dark Potery. You will like this.,The movie was boring. But beatiful because like the summery on top that I typed up. But if you played a video game called D and D2. You will like this movie is like a live-action version of it. A girl want to know what happend to her father. But happened to know the dark truth.
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!! BREAKS IN A FEW MONTHS!!!!,This stand is weak as hell! It lasted a few months and then broke at the neck's base. I have a Schecter Hellraiser guitar and this stand couldn't support it.BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. You will be likely to waste you money and have to replace this cheaply made piece of junk they call a stand
3,All Right But Not Detailed Enough,"This book is helpful if you already know what you need to fix and where it's located. It was very helpful in showing how to remove the door panels to get at the power window motor. Unfortunately, when it came to find where the relay for the motor was located, I needed to get a Chilton's manual. You're better off with Chilton's if you need the detail."
2,Not the best Haynes book,I grew up working on cars with a garage full of tools and the Haynes manual for whichever car I was working on. This book I think tried to cover too much and leaves a lot out. The pictures are the worst I've seen in a Haynes Manual and the descriptions are pretty cryptic. They actually make it look like they don't want you to do much work on the car yourself.I have a 2002 Camaro SS that I will not take to the mechanic unless I absolutely have to. Unfortunately this book won't be much help.
3,Good old haynes,"As a long time faithful to Haynes, I love the usability of this manual. However, what's stopping me from awarding a higher star rating is the fact it caters more for the pre-98 v8 engine, the lt1. I own an ls1 which is a completely different unit and they don't even show a Picture of it. The rest, business as usual."
4,Exactly the same as the Chiltons,"This book is almost exactly the same as the Chiltons manual, just a lot cheaper. Same pictures, same author, same text, in the same order. The Chiltons is bigger, although that mostly has to do with more blank space. There may be a few minor differences, but there is no reason to own both that I can see.It's still not very detailed. In some instances it will show photographs of the 93-97 version while explaining the 98-02 version. Sometimes it tells you what size tool you need, sometimes it doesn't.It's still a useful reference guide for the home mechanic."
4,Haynes helps you out,"I drive a Chevrolet Camaro Z28 '96 which (currently) needs a transmission service, replaced distributor etc. This called for a good technical manual. Haynes Manuals are among the best. It's easy to follow with just enough info to get the job done! It really helped me out."
4,gorgeous love poems,"a must have for lovers. in french and english. perfect if you have a french lover. only complaint is that many of the poems aer about love lost, or past love."
2,Just okay,"This book is fun but teaches little about poetry other than how to end sentences in rhyming words. It gives kids a head start, but with a poem that the author (a poet laureate) mostly wrote, that isn't much of a feeling of accomplishment."
4,Panasonic KX-TG2650CN,"I've only had the Elite for about 2 weeks,and have used it for up to 1HR15Min on a long distance call and still had lots of battery life left,I'm in Canada and don't know if our KX-TG2650CN is any different. The only difference in the No is CN which the C is for Canada. So far I love the Phone but will keep a close watch on it for problems.Phil"
5,"Owned and used the phone daily for 2+ years, and no problems yet!","I've had this phone for over 2 years, and I have had ABSOLUTELY no problems with it. We recently moved it to the bedroom after upgrading our main living area phone to 5.8 GHz, but it still functions like it did the day we bought it. I have had NO battery problems, in fact, it stays charged longer than other phones I've had. I like the option to have it wall mounted or desk-top, and we've done both. The size is great, especially now that most people are used to cell phones. Someone mentioned in another review that they couldn't figure out some of the buttons, but they obviously didn't read the manual. One of the great things about this phone is you can set up your direct-dial voice mail number (called voice mail) PLUS the button called direct can be set up to call another number you use frequently with one touch! Overall, this has been a great phone, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,TERRIBLE BATTERY,"I BEEN TRUSTED PANASONIC FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.....UNTIL I OWNED THIS PHONE,I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTS.I NEVER EVER BUY PANASONIC PRODUCTS AGAIN !!!"
3,"Installer, please!","Amazon promptly shipped my order, which I received in a couple of days. Getting the darned thing installed was another matter. It took me multiple emails to Amazon customer service and a few weeks before the installer finally contacted me. The installer said he was coming on a weekday morning (thereby forcing me to take a morning off of work) but didn't show up till 7 PM. The remote does not work as advertised, possibly because the programmer didn't program it correctly, or it's just plain broken. A friend of mine has the same problem with the remote, ie, you can't turn the TV on or off with it. Now that things are up an running the reception and satellite service are fine as long I turn the television on at the television and not with the remote."
5,Can't believe we went without satellite for so long!,"I ordered this item and received it in 4 days. The satellite installers had called me to schedule before I even received the system. I can't believe how painless the procedure was, I receive the system on a Wednesday, got it installed on Saturday the 10th and my husband is in hog heaven. Things could not have gone any smoother. This comes with an interactive feature that allows you to buy and get info. on commercial and even request a brochure. This item is so cool."
3,The box was opened... the item was o.k.,"Overall: it is ok.But the box was opened, the shipping was too bad."
1,An Unhappy Camper,"I have been most disappointed in my Direct tv Satelite. I cannot tape one program and watch another. We have had regular interruptions, where the picture stops and holds for a moment, the sound goes on. I can't get my local Cable channels. The remote often has delays where it won't change channels. I anxiously await the end of my 12 month contract."
1,Pro Installation should be changed to Poor Installation,Equipment works OK. But installer put the equipment in a location that was fine in the winter. Now the leaves come out and big problem. Every time it rains and the system shouts down. The installer has moved away and Direct TV has no interest in helping me correct the problem. Be very cafeful if you chose Direct TV they are not that much better than Cable TV.
5,love it!,"we've been homeschooling for 3 yrs and searching for the right curriculum for us. this was finally what we'd be looking for. flexible, interactive, and fun."
5,From the Publisher,"""As of this writing no weapons of mass destruction have been found. And, even if a cache were to be uncovered, can anyone seriously believe that weak, defenseless Iraq ever seriously intended to attack the United States?No, we really must conclude that it was oil, the need of the United States to control the oil of the Gulf, that sent America to war.The important thing now to comprehend is why was the oil of the Persian Gulf specifically so important to get control of?And that is where this book should be a help. . . .""-from the Preface"
4,Pretty good..,"The only question I have about Charles and Diana is why is it that it was accepted practice for a future British Crown to carry on before, during and after marriage, and even before his divorce was finial, to carry on an extra- marital affair and not have to account for his actions to the Queen. She was criticized, he never was chastised by the Crown for his actions. A disgrace if you ask me. It seemed his actions were okay..hers were not. I have no regard for the Prince of Wales, and I have read many books on his life, which seems to dilute his personal actions and doesn't hold him accountable for his behavior.After one gets through the beginning pages of this book, the unfolding events are quite heart wrentching."
1,A waste of money.,"BOOOO to this nightmare! I like Felix the Cat, but not this obnoxious full length crap. The demons ruined a perfectly good movie. I enjoyed the Felix cartoons from the 1920s and '30s because that's real entertaiment. At least I didn't have to deal with evil beings on the classics."
4,This book was awesome!,"This book had a very good plot but I did think that Elizabeth went a little overboard,but it was still awesome. I liked all the lines from the real play so that I could recite them. The ending was good too and I encourage anyone to read it. Keep up the good work Francine!"
3,This book could have been better,I think that this book could have been way better. All that really happens is that Elizabeth auditions for the role of Juliet for Jessica and the she gets jealous because her crush is playing opposite Jessica.
4,Interesting Account of King George III,"Christopher Hibbert has once again produced a well researched account of another interesting and great man. Following on from Nelson and Wellington comes this very readable biography of the English King, George III. I'm not too sure what sort of reception this book will receive in the United States where I take it he was not so well liked in his time but its a very enjoyable book and offers a very interesting and detailed look at, by all accounts, a popular King. The book took a little to get into but after a few chapters it was becoming one of those books that you find hard to put down. The author covers every facet of George III's life including his family, politics, social life and his madness. The King appears to have been a very kind and considerate Monach and took great interest in his subjects and the humanities. Its a great yarn and I'm sure that readers both sides of the Atlantic will enjoy the story."
5,great book,"This is a very readable account of the life of King George III, with wonderful insights into his sometimes troubled private life. Mr. Hibbert brings the 18th century to life in vivid color and I recommend this book to anyone who loves history, whether or not you know anything about George III."
4,Likeable George,"Mr. Jefferson gave HRH George III quite a scolding in the Declaration of Independence, but one can't come away from Hibbert's biography without warming to the man. The book is a good choice for the reader seeking familiarization with George III's life; some chapters, which deal with family matters and political episodes, are only 4-5 pages long. Particularly interesting are the glimpses one gets of everyday life - ""terracing"" (evening walks during the summer) by the Royal Family, the King's pleasure in interactions with common folks, suggestions of a sincere Christian faith, and pithy (sometimes snide) remarks by or about one person or the other. One feels sympathy while reading about the mental illness that claimed his later years. 18th century/American Revolution enthusiasts will enjoy this fuller picture of the ""other George"" across the pond."
4,Worth Reading,"Who was the English King at the time of The American Revolution? I dunno!!! Well, now I do know and, furthermore, I now know something about his private and public life before and after The American Revolution. He reigned for over 50 years and the last years of his reign were about 200 ""short"" years ago. One thing that impressed me was the sorry state of ""the medical art"" even in those days. Taking blood from sick people was supposed to cure them. Giving arsenic was supposed to cure certain ailments. Today, we are way ahead of these primitive practices....all we do is give medicines that are ""poison"" such as depression medication and cold medicine and ""antibiotics"" for viruses which have no effect.....and doctors do unnecessary surgeries frequently so they can get money from the naive and trusting patients. But, that's another story and another book! Read about King George 3rd; you'll find it interesting. Boland7214@aol"
4,Satisfying read,"Very detailed, personal account of an interesting and complex character. For history buffs like me, you'll love the fascinating details about family life, medical history, etc. A little too much about politics and military strategy, but not so much that I wouldn't recommend to others."
3,"Disappointing, but useable","I read several reviews that touted the ability to use regular sized ice cubes, and it did appear to have a wider neck than my 16 oz. version of this design. In reality, the neck is even smaller, and only the tiniest of cubes can be inserted, without having to manually melt them down. The push-button opening top is something I've really come to appreciate on the smaller version, so I was attracted to this larger model that also had it. However, it has NEVER fully opened as designed. Never. If you lean the bottle back a little when you push the button, it at least will go all the way over, but still fails to go all the way and activate the little catch Other than these two deficiencies, it would otherwise be a great product. Excellent insulation properties, and built like a tank."
3,5 stars for water; 2 stars for iced drinks,"It's true, this keeps ice cubes for 24 hours or more. The build quality is great. So why only three stars? I bought it so I could have iced coffee at my desk all day, and it does its job. However, I find myself reaching for theThermos Nissan JMW500P6 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Backpack Bottle, Silverover this one for everyday use. The base on this one makes it too bulky to fit well in any of my cup holders (and my car has 8 of them, of various sizes!). The chug spout is weird to drink coffee out of (this is admittedly a very subjective feeling.) The narrow opening makes it hard to scoop ice into. This has basically been relegated for use as a water bottle; it's great for that use, keeps water cold and is great to chug out of during long hikes. But since I had bought it intending to use it for something else, I thought I would share my experience so that others know that it may have its drawbacks."
1,"Three months, base came off and top already leaks! :(","I've had this water bottle for about three months but have only taken it out to walk with maybe 10-12 times. Within the first 5 times the plastic base came off, which isn't a big deal as it still stands up without the base. Just today I took it out and the top is leaking near the hinge.Definitely not worth $20; If wanted something that was going to crack and leak I could've bought a plastic one for $3 elsewhere. My large Stanley thermos hasn't disappointed, I'll be looking to them for a new water bottle."
1,Disappointed,"Bought in November. Great idea, but inner gasket in bottle leaked and failed by February. Can't find replacement seal. Anyone want a leaky water bottle?"
5,Great bottle!,"I love love love this thermos! I bought this thermos after my other thermos lost its straw. I love to keep water with me at all times, and this fits great into a purse. The extra lock on the lid is a great idea as well. It keeps my water cold for about 24 hours. Very happy with this thermos!"
5,Keeps Cold For Days,This hydration bottle will keep ice and water cold for severals days - it's amazing! The ice is still intact more than 24 hours after you fill the thermos.
2,Poor Quality Control,"This is my very first product review. I received this stainless steel Thermos as a gift and had the rubber bottom fall off the very first day (before I used the Thermos). I returned the Thermos to Amazon for a replacement (no problem with the exchange) and received a second identical Thermos within approximately 7-10 days. After washing the Thermos by hand, the rubber bottom fell off this Thermos as well. While this may be a good product I would hold off buying this for several months to see if the manufacturer can improve quality control measures."
5,THE BEST Cold Water Bottle,"This bottle is THE BEST cold water bottle. Over the past 5 years, I have purchased at least 5 of the Thermos 22-ounce leak-proof hydration bottles. I place ice cubes in the bottle at 7:00 AM then at 7:00 PM check inside the bottle. There is still ice in the bottle. The bottle does not leak. I have walked outside on the Las Vegas, NV Strip in 112 degree weather for a total of an hour. The outside of the bottle may be hot (due to sun exposure) but the water inside the bottle is ice cold. The bottle will retain its cold keeping capability as long as you do not drop the bottle. I gave one to my son to take to school. He has dropped it 4 or 5 times. After the bottle dropping incidents, the bottle's ability to keep liquids cold has diminished to 3 or 4 hours. Just be mindful of not dropping the bottle, and, you will continue to have THE BEST cold water bottle."
3,You can not use the lid as a cup!! NOT REALLY MADE FOR COFFEE!,"While this is a quality thermous it seems very odd to me that they would not make the lid screw off and be used as a cup. This used to be the best thing about the old thermous. It just pops open and exposes a lip to drink from and the top just flops there uselessly.This is basically an overbuilt water bottle, it is not entended to be for hot drinks (the warranty on the tags even says ""Use with cold beverages only""). It seems better suited for ""chuging"" cold beverages from it.......but who wants to ""chug"" ice cold beverages? Also, even the ""chuging"" factor is bad, there is only one hole.... so there is no pressure relief from another hole, so instead of the water just pouring out nicely it ""glubs"" out.Bottom line: I purchased this to take coffee with me on cold days....and it works, but I really do not like the fact that I have to carry another cup around with me........wtf?"
1,A major design flaw!,"I own a lot of nissan thermos products, which I absolutely love, but this product has a major ANNOYING design flaw. There's an O-ring on the product that falls off when you wash or rinse off the lid. In fact it's the fourth use of the product, and I could not figure out why it kept leaking. The first leak was when the item was filled with water, so it dried; this time the leak is with coffee, so I have stains all over paperwork, which is annoying. Sure enough the item is missing the silicone O-ring. So, while this item does keep things hot or cold, there are other products with better designs.I bought two, and I intend on returning both."
2,Never cold,"Based on the glowing reviews I purchased 2 of these Thermos Bottles. I bought them to keep fresh juice cold, but no matter what I put inside, the liquid is never cold.I tried putting cold water in it first. I tried putting cold water in it, placing it in the freezer for half and hour, then putting my juice in it... and I keep the Thermos in the refrigerator! and still, the liquid is never cold. It's almost as if the Thermos is KEEPING the cold from the liquid, it is very strange. If you keep the Thermos and Juice out of the fridge, the juice is practically rancid by the afternoon.I tried so many things and of course, it's now way past 7 days to return the Thermos to the Amazon Seller and when I contacted Thermos, they only exchange.The design is nice. The size is good. Water, from washing, does drip out from the black base when you drink however, so prepare for wet stains."
1,Not really a Thermos,"This item is confusing: if you're looking for a nice thermos (something to store both cold and HOT beverages in) this is not it. This device is apparently only made to store cold beverages, and has no associated Thermos style cup, but instead only a spout. If you're looking for a flashy 20$ water bottle, this is it."
5,WARNING: No replacement parts,"No replacement gaskets are available for this item from Thermos. If you lose the gasket that seals the lid to the bottle (it will disconnect if you drop the lid) you will own a rather expensive very leaky water bottle.Edited on 11/26/2008. I lied! If you call Thermos they will send you replacement gaskets free of charge. I couldn't find the parts on the internet when I wrote the original review. Sorry about that Thermos people. I up my rating to 5 stars.Edited on 01/25/2012. I updated this to five stars to match my actual opinion and to unskew the average review rating. I'm still using this daily after all this time. Oddly enough, I found my original ""lost"" gasket. It was under the stove. Yeah, I know, I'm a lousy housekeeper."
4,Thermos Stainless-Steel 22oz Leak-Proof Hydration Bottle,"Got this as a gift for a friend, and he loves it. Says it keeps his coffee hot all morning."
3,"Stays really cold, but NOT leak-proof","Pros: Stays REALLY cold. Had ice in it, left it out til the next day, ice was still frozen!Cons: 1) Due to the insulated sides, liquid area is not as large as you'd expect given the outside size.2) If you tip it upside down, the cap fills with water...(a) when you make it rightside up, the water from the cap seeps out the sides, and (b) then when you open it, all the water from the cap spills out."
4,THE BEST LINE OF THERMOS BOTTLES ON THE MARKET,"I'm 53 years old, and have spent a great deal of time driving. This line of thermos bottles is the best. The large 22 oz and the smaller 16 oz. You keep that lid shut and what's inside will stay hot for at least 6 hours. I haven't tried to keep something cold in one yet. They're a bit pricy, but, they work. Buy it."
4,"So far, so good","I've had it for 4 months, works very well so far. The headset is light but it takes a little getting used to how it sits on your head. After a few weeks, hardly notice you have it on. Reception is good but occastionally static, I've learned a trick which is to gently pull the earpiece away from your head and back. This clears the static. It's a unique phone, nothing else like it on the market for this price range. I'd recommend it if you really need hands-free capabilities. Friends and family love it - I'm buying 3 more as Christmas gifts."
3,IBM Cordless Headset,"I purchased this product 6 months ago. It's great for mom's with kids at home that need to have their hands free. I have found several problems with my headset. I find that the volume on the headset does not get louder. Wheel just keeps on turning. I find that when I turn microwave on I get really bad static, as well as when my neighbor uses her microwave and I'm on the phone I get the same static our houses are about 100 yards apart from each other. I also get clicking in the headset as well. I change channels but doesn't seem to help much. I don't know if anyone else has this problem. I've exchanged my headset and phone has the same problems. I'm looking for another manufacture that carries this same design, but have had no luck yet. It's a great phone to have if headset didn't have so many little problems."
3,IBM 3330 Cordless Telephone,"I have been using this phone for only one day,and have found that the range is not nearly as good as my GE 900mhz Cordless Telephone. I find it hard to believe that someone has found it to be good for up to two acres,150yds has been my limit. Does anyone have any idea as to what could be wrong? The styling and design are great,just expected more range. These phones are available at Sam's warehouse stores in Missouri."
2,Not worth it,"I spent a lot of money on this phone and expected it to work well, at this point I would even settle for decent. The box claims ""Superior Clarity, Extended Range..."" No... I don't think so. I hear a lot of static about 50% of the time, and the range does not even cover my home about 2,000 sf. I would feel better about the purchase if I did not spend so much. I should have waited for the technology to evolve a little. The head set is comfortable and lightweight, I will give it that. I would say if the phone is about $[$$] it would be worth it because it is convenient to be completely hands free when you can hear your caller. I want to love the phone but I can't say that I do."
1,This phone is horrible!,"after spending more than 100 bucks, you expect at least decent customer service. The seller provided little customer service except to leave the phone on charging when the low battery warning comes. GREAT!!!! I DIDNT KNOW THAT!The earlier model which is 900mhz is a great buy. It has the same features, can be used with a computer and has an extended battery life. I got mine from amazon, but they are hard to find."
2,Expected so much and got so little,"...The battery doesn't stay charged, the phone goes dead in about 2 minutes and the reception is really bad. I love the way the headset fits and REALLY needed a phone like this...hopefully it will work good for me once I try the new battery. So far I feel pretty bummed that I spent so much money on this phone."
2,I have 3 - they are ALL BAD!!,"I have 3 different versions of this IBM headset phone - various models. Each time I thought they would improve. They didn't! Please head my advice - don't waste your $$! It's a great idea, and nothing out there like it, but these phones don't hold a charge after a month or so, the noise interference is awful, and they randomly have static on the lines for no apparent reason. I wish they would work for my home business - but they simply don't work well. Just don't do it!!"
5,It is a Unique phone....I love it,"I love this phone...leaves my hands completely free and with no wires dangling around my shoulder. While some other reviewers had complained about static....I have not noticed any static at all on my phone. For some it may be a little pricey, but I have not found a similar phone anywhere else for any price....I am not sure why there are not more phones of this kind."
2,Good Idea: Bad Technology,"We bought the phone six months ago, and have experienced the problems of clicking, hiss, and poor volume control described by others."
5,Lovely little book packed with power,"I really love this little book. Like a humble person who has walked around the world and has to be drawn out to talk about it, this little unassuming book is packed with power, not the least of which is that when you read its stories and use its novenas you know you have power beyond your own flesh and blood efforts to live in the world. You are not alone. My own favorite saint, St Therese, and my personal favorite prayer, The Memorare, come together in this book in a burden-lifting instrument of inner peace. Buy it. You will find help in ways you might not expect."
4,Informative,"Gives some information that could be get lost from the older generation of Catholics. I appreciate and adore what they know, and the strength in their faith. Also, provides some prayers. Good."
2,Average,"I'm sure the other Novenas in this book are great, but i bought it specifically for the 54 day Rosary Novena, and well, the book has it all wrong. Theres a nice story about the Novena, but no detail and not even close to the correct opening prayers and methods of how to do this Novena. Dissapointed."
3,"Good technically, but...","I'd prefer that the samples were reusable. For example, instead of creating a generic data control that you can use in all your projects, the book demonstrates how to make one to specifically access the sample database. Obviously, it can be modified to work with any project, but ideally, you should be able to use it without modification. The same goes for most of the books examples-- they're well written, but specific-- if they don't fit your needs, you will need to invest some time in the modification process.Overall, this is a good book. But since it's billed as ""The definitive VB5 Database Problem Solver,"" I'd like more reusability."
3,"""You're watching Fright Night here on... Sci-Fi.""","WILLIAM SHATNER'S FULL MOON FRIGHT NIGHT (2002) contains ""Vampire Journals,"" the debut installment of that short-lived SCI-FI channel TV series. Everything that was popular (also annoying) about this long-defunct program is here: blood and bare bosoms, decapitations and dead things, low-grade special effects and high camp host segments.Without benefit of fadeouts or commercial interruptions, the several ""back to our movie"" cut-ins seem to pop up like a terminal herpe. Such jarringly bright studio shots contrast poorly against an otherwise dark and forboding story about a lady concert pianist who's under the spell of a pointy-toothed sanguinary slurper.BTW, how come nobody in these little fables ever notices that the undead guy has a terribly bluish complexion? Ah well.""And now, back to the William Shatner channel!""(Bonus feature: Bill interviews comic book legend Stan Lee.)"
3,MUST BE TWILIGHT PREQUEL,"MUST BE TWILIGHT PREQUEL as both stories contain feuding vampires and bad actors. Why do vampires only go after chicks that look like Denise Richards? Seems to me a fat chick would be easier to bag and would contain a few extra more days of blood. In this movie the bad vampire rips open the girl's top before he bites her neck, whereas the good vampire allows the victim to remove it. I also noticed the bad vampire got to sleep with two topless chicks. They didn't have sex, it was I bite you, you bite me, fake an orgasm then roll over and go to sleep. I guess when you get to be a few hundred years old, women don't expect too much. As far as movie ratings go, if you were to take away the nudity, subtract a star. If you fast forward through Shatner's attempt at humor, add a star."
5,Loved them,"I got these for my sister in law and she loves them, they keep her warm stayed their shape after washing and did not pill up."
5,Perfect!,They were a surprise gift for a friend who has always wanted a pair! She almost cried after she jumped up and down. They fit perfect and she is a small girl. Very pleased.
4,Snuggly,"Excellent product just wish the sizing chart would have been more accurate as they were a little big for the wife, otherwise she is very happy with them."
1,only soft on the outside,It was very uncomfortable on the inside yet very soft on the outside. It also had some weird bunching in the back didn't like it at all. Returned it.
3,Pajamas for bigger feet?,"Recently I purchased pair of large footie pajamas for Christmas. While they're warm and wash up nicely... I do have one thing I didn't like about this product.The foot part of the pajama was quite long(shoe size 9?) and,didn't fit snugly around the ankle. Could be health hazard when walking as pajamas have so much ""length"". Perhaps, these pj's were meant for a 5' 6"" or taller person .It would be nice if manufacturer could make for women 5'4"" and under,too.I did like that the waist was somewhat form fitting,however.If I had purchased medium I think they would have been too small on top."
3,Fits goofy,Bought this for the wife as a joke gift. From the waist up it fits great. Otherwise she looks like a kangaroo. Has a wierd pouch shape to them and the legs are long.
4,warm & fuzzy,"The Pjs were exactly what we were looking for - adult sized footie pajamas. They're a bit warm, but that's OK. You do look like Thing1 (from Dr. Suess), but that's OK too!"
4,warm but not very soft,"Having no memory of wearing a footed sleeper, maybe my expectations were too high.Though it keeps me nice and warm, the inside is not snuggly and soft like I thought it would be. The OUTSIDE of the sleeper is very soft, but I'm not on the outside.That said, I no longer wake up cold at night.I am going to shop for another brand and hope that will be more comfortable on the inside."
3,good but some problems,"I got these for my girl for christmass and they came in good time and they are really comfy she says but the only thing is that she is 5'2"" and only 120 and the medium is very big if anything buy a size smaller than you are. But i think she looks good in them so im happy."
4,Wrong Item,"I ordered these LG in pink and LG & XL in cranberry. the pink and the XL in cranberry came without a problem but the L in cranberry came as a lounge set...no footie pjs! Beware and check the confirmation and if you see lounge set, the order will not be what you want. I am pleased with the ones that are what I ordered."
2,pajamas,"The pajamas were made very nice. My problem is that I ordered a small which to me would be a 7-8, this was extra large. I wasn't able to give it to the person. I ordered it for."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I am so frustrated with this company. I bought footed p.j.'s for my teenage kids for Christmas. When the p.j.'s arrived, I wrapped them and put them under the tree for Christmas. Unfortunately, Christmas was over 14 days away. On Christmas morning, one of the kids' p.j.'s were too small. I immediately wrote an email to jumpinjammerz, asking them what I needed to do to exchange for a larger size. Wait a few days, no response. I emailed again, three more times over the next 3 weeks. No response at all. Today I called them. I was politely told that since the order was over 14 days ago, I cannot exchange, I cannot have a refund, I don't even get a token discount on a pair to replace the ones they won't take back. What a waste of money. Even though the product is nice, I will not do business with the company again."
3,Comfy but HUGE!,"I just got these, and they are quite comfy. The main problem I have with them is that they are HUGE! I am 5 feet tall, about 130lbs, and I ordered a small (because that is the smallest size available) and the crotch hangs down half way to my knees! The feet are probably about 2 or 3 sizes too big, and I don't have small feet even though I'm short. I wear a size 8.5(US)! I don't know what kind of small this is supposed to be but it's not small. They fit my boyfriend who is 5foot 8inches tall!! Other than that, they are comfortable, soft and cozy. I got a little claustrophobic in them but that's just cuz I'm not used to it yet, I'm sure in the winter it'll be better. My main review and/or critizism is that they need to make them in an extra-small for short people like myself. The whole world is not between 5'6"" and 6' tall.I gave them 3 stars only because of the horrible sizing, other than that I would have given them a 4 or 5."
4,Great Price and Good Product,"Purchased for my wife for Christmas and she loved it. She is 5' 9"" and the large fit her just fine."
2,"Valuable questions, yet inherently flawed!","This book is most valuable for those preparing for the GRE who are after a plethora of real GRE-like questions (other review books I have used have questions that seem much harder or easier (i.e. not realistic). The major flaw of this book is that it only includes explanations for one of its tests, and also that there are some errors in the awnser key.... at least in the Logic sections.I would still recommed it though, these are the questions that appear on the GRE and the best way to raise your score is practice, practice, practice!"
3,Product worth the money and the time,"The content of the book is just like the questions in GRE CAT. It is important to do as many problems as possible from ETS publications as possible. It is definitely going to increase your score. Exposing yourself to as many ETS questions as possible not only helps you revise concepts but also to formulate a way of dealing with a variety of questions with confidence. But if you already have the ETS big book, you may dispense with this book as atleast 4 of the tests in this edition are already in the Big Book. So if you can lay your hands on the now hard-to-get Big book, it would be a better alternative. Else do not let go of the chance to go through 8 very helpful question papers. The only setback is that it is in paper mode and is in the old format - two sections each of V,Q,A.If you want to know my scores as an indication of the effectiveness of this book - V 710, A 800, Q 800."
1,I'd Give It Zero If I Could,"My dissatisfaction with this DVD player began with the manual, which had no useful info on hooking up the player to a receiver rather than a TV (even though it also plays audio CDs). Then, several times during its lifetime it wouldn't ""see"" a DVD or CD that was clearly there in the tray, which could be remedied by moving that disc to a different slot in the tray. Finally, after 1 yr and 4 mos, it has died with a fatal H02 error that is not fixed by any of the suggestions in the manual."
1,Terrible CD-R CD-RW compatibility,"I make lot of home video in VCD format on CD-R & CD-RW discs, this unit has terrible compatiblity when reading these discs, it play the slow rated 8X or slower CD-R/RW OK, but virtually all the blank CD-R/RW disc are high speed rated like 32X to 40X, the player just won't read those disk at all half the time, those it reads but skipps a lot. So if you want just play commercial type DVD movie, it's a great player, but for home made CD-R/RW recordings, forget it. Get an APEX DVD player, it reads them all."
5,GREAT DVD PLAYER,"Got it a month ago....... install, set up, playing is very easy. Plays DVD, home-made CD, and regular CD perfectly. Change rest while playing one. Excellent! Highly recommended."
1,Terrible quality,"I purchased one of these in November 2001. By May it had gone haywire, refusing to load any disc, giving me an error code that meant ""contact service."" I spent a great deal of money on shipping and repairs (it was past 90 days of course) and then by October, less than a year after purchased, the problem had occurred again. Panasonic support is terrible, non-responsive, promising callbacks, and then nothing happening."
3,Incompatible,"I liked this DVD player when I first bought it -- sound and picture are good, but lately I've been having problems with format incompatibility. Even though the product description says it's compatible with CD-R I haven't been able to get it to recognize that format. I also have a lot of trouble with Video CDs -- my success rate getting them to play is about 50/50."
4,wonderful player with a few flaws,"Needed to replace my old Panasonic DVD player, which was faulty and would cost over $100 to repair. But I also wanted multi-disc capability like my old magazine style CD player had.This met both needs (DVD and multi-disc) and it runs flawless.However, the remote is difficult to read in the dark and the tiny closely spaced buttons don't help."
4,Another Fine Paul Buskirk Collaboration,"Paul Buskirk and Willie Nelson join together again for more special music. Paul and Willie also perform on Willie's album ""Nacogdoches"", which also features Gary Weldon on harmonica and flugel horn. Paul Schmidt plays nifty guitar on ""Nacogdoches""."
3,Sengai's drawings book review,"For the people interested in Zen this book is an excellent way to learn about one of the most influential monks in Zen history. Sengai was not only a monk, but a great artist whose art was expressed through his drawings. And this book written by D.T. Suzuki, author of numerous books about Zen, is focused mainly in explaining the meaning behind some of the Senagi's drawings. A negative aspect about this book is that the quality of the ilustration's prints is almost like the one of a newspaper. I tought I would find the same quality as the drawing from the cover but it was a big disappointment. Still, through the bad prints, we can appreciate the sublime art of Sengai."
4,Divine Humor Guided His Hands,"This is an informal and accessible guide to Master Sengai's work, a man who in his study of Zen stumbled rather appropriately into the ink drawing art of sumi-e as a means of revealing for himself and others the essence of wisdom. It has been said that the secret of the Tao is so simple that if it were to suddenly become common knowledge, laughter would be heard everywhere. Looking at Sengai's art is to experience that truth and I recommend this as an antidote to the stifling austerity to which religious traditions are so often view as being caught up."
4,Exactly What I Was Hoping For,"I purchased this book to give me ideas on which type of pattern/material I should use to reupholster a Victorian settee frame I recently bought. After looking through the breathtaking photos on these glossy pages, I know exactly which material to go with. And of course, from viewing this book I have a desire to purchase other victorian pieces to accompany the settee. It's a step back in time that must be seen.This is a wonderful book. Also, this book was like brand new although it is used. Just wish there were more pages."
4,CLASSIC ROOMS OF NORTH AMERICAN HOMES,"If you are interested in Victorian style, especially that of the United States,this book is a good start. The book is not very large, it is rather thin, but easy to carry around if considering ideas for your own home or apartment. The author gives you precise and interesting backgrounds on many rooms of the Victorian style and how they were used. You will also enjoy some of the exterior home photos of classic Victorian houses from California and other states. This book is also very well priced for all the valuable information you get."
2,Lamarque Deserved Better,"I bought this thinking it would be a good introduction to ""La reina del tango"". It isn't. I find it hard to believe that Lamarque, a multimedia superstar for decades, was as bad as this so-called tribute makes her sound. There are too many tracks from late in her career, when her voice wasn't what it used to be and she couldn't hit the high notes any more. It's as if the folks at Sony rounded up a couple dozen rejects from other compilation albums, threw in a few bona fide hits, and called it an album. They didn't bother with liner notes, and the dates given in the track listings do not often correspond to the actual recording dates. Sony's treatment of this artist -- and the people they've duped into buying an inferior product -- borders on contempt. Shame on Sony."
2,Only slightly better than aluminum foil...,"I had aluminum foil attached via coaxial cable to my T.V. before I purchased this antenna. After hooking the antenna up, I noticed only marginal improvements. Also, if you want to change between lesser reception channels, you have to completely reposition the antenna. I would return it, but I would get barely half of what I paid for it, since I would still have to pay for return shipping as well as the original shipping cost."
3,Improves reception but . . .,"no more than the rabbit ears that came with the television. As long as you can try it and then return it, worth a try based on others' reviews where they did have good luck with this antenna. Didn't work for me."
2,Not what I expected,"Based on the reviews and the picture I was expecting an antenna that would hookup to both the TV and the VCR. Instead it only hooks to the TV.The reception is very good, a much better improvement than what I had. Now I have to search for help and while searching for help found out that RCA is owned by Thomson Multimedia and there's no central office to contact.If you only have one TV and no VCR or DVD, this gives very good reception, but forget it if you have all types of extras with the TV."
2,Snow Crystals (Dover Photography Collections),"It had some very ineresting shapes but I found it very boring. I think it could have been put together better, especially for the price"
3,Full Moon Clipshow,"Basically, this is a clipshow of past Full Moon and Charles Band films. I like it, as some of these movies are not yet on DVD. It has clips from the following:SubspeciesBloodstone: Subspecies IIShriekerDr. Moreau's House Of PainHead Of The FamilyThe Killer EyeVampire JournalsBleedDr. Mordrid (clip's worth the price alone!)The Dead Hate the LivingThe CreepsCreepozoidsI believe there are a few more.+ you get the videozones for the older titles.A great package for those new to Full Moon or horror.Also recomended:Boogeymen: The Killer CompilationWhen Puppets & Dolls AttackAliens Gone Wild!Subspecies 4: Bloodstor,"
3,Must order a less size,This product has good material but it came bigger than i am. Am size Medium and the product is bigger than medium.
5,Amazing Jeans!!,"This was my 1st pair of Wranglers & I just got them today in the mail. They are amazing Jeans!My fiancé is a Wranglers fan and has been telling me how awesome they are so I looked at a few places and decided on these with all the great reviews. I'm a true hourglass figure, small waist & bigger hips, and 5'7 so all the Jeans I get are either too short, way too low rise or not true to the size. These hug my curves, the fabric is amazing, heavy duty,are not so low I'm afraid to bend over and u actually can buy a size smaller! I'm so happy I decided on these and am going to be getting another pair very soon! Thank you to the woman at Wrangler for FINALLY making Jeans for real woman! <3"
5,Best tea ever!,"It's hard to find loose leaf tea around here so I ordered it and am well pleased. This is tea like Mom used to make, full of flavor but light and satisfying on those hot summer days as iced tea, and the same on those cold winter days as hot tea.Loose leaf tea is also less expensive and that's a bonus!"
1,it has not arrived,"hi, greeting I made my purchase from Tegucigalpa Honduras, and the delivery was for MARYLAN, 20912 M.D. My mother I travel yesterday and it said to me that: This Product Never I arrive Not to that it must east problem, the other products if they arrived less this"
4,"Fast delivery, good product",I bought this as a gift for someone. It arrived VERY quickly and the person I gave it to likes it very much. Good product. Great service.
3,Does not look like a genuine Sony Ericcson Product,"The product does not have a genuine Sony Ericcson Logo on it, but the quality is fine."
2,Case fits phone well just falls off my belt easy,It is a nice leather case that fits the phone well. Easy to remove and insert phone. Good quality product except the belt clip is smooth and works it's way off of my belt easily. Twice the phone was returned to me by co-workers as I had no idea it had fallen off. I replaced this case with one made by Krusell in their Horizon Line. Very good case with a Multidapt clip that stays on your belt.
4,"Lots of features packed into 19"" TV",The RCA Program Guide is fabulous! i have enjoyed it for 4 months! i don't know how i ever lived without it!! GET ONE!P.S. The only way to do better is to get the bigger screen!
1,Dry Wash,"Not worth a darn for anything. IN face, if you are not careful and you pick up a speck of dirt it will scratch your pain job. I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this item."
5,Great Book,This book is so well layed out. I give this book 5 stars because it has excellent descriptions and pictures. I built the terra cotta fountain in the book and I love it so much.
1,Don't Buy More Than 1,"Before I purchased the units I called ttsystems the distributor to make sure there would be no compatability issues using more than 1 unit. I needed 5 but chose to buy just 3 in case there was a problem and there was. They do not display Call Waiting ID because all 3 are trying to send the siganls back to the switching station at the phone company at the same time, a problem that I was afraid of but was told by ttsystems did not exist. My phone service is provided by Verizon and is about as industry standard as you can get. The Call Back feature also does not work with multiple units. If you need Call Waiting Caller ID Displays and you need more than one this is DEFINITELY NOT the unit for you."
1,Mine Doesn't Work Either,"This seemed like a niffty device, but it has never sounded an alert. I thought I may have programmed it wrong (the instructions are written in ""chinese english,"") but worked very carefully with it last night and am certain I've got it set properly. Any way, tons of weather warnings from the NWS last night and this thing didn't make a single peep. I think the Consumer Prodcut Safety Commission should investigate these things. I wouldn't buy any product from Marine Midland until they fess up to this life threatening defect."
4,Works as advertised,"This is a nice unit that does what it says it does-- alert the user to warnings and watches for a large number of situations. We've used it during the busy spring weather season and it has never failed to warn us of impending events (severe thunderstorms, flash floods, tornadoes, even a child abduction), always a few minutes before our local television stations. Setup seemed confusing at first but two minutes with the manual made it quite clear and easy. The only glitch was that I had to look up our county code on the Internet-- the 800 number given was never available. With the SAME technology we keyed in on our county alone, and disabled activation for watches that we don't care about-- a really nice feature. It also includes a standard weather radio for forecasts whenever we like, plus an FM radio (which we don't use) and a clock. I'm very satisfied with the unit."
4,2nd Edition Review,"Well, firstly I must say that this book could do with a great deal more mathematical rigour. Units are missing in areas that are somewhat critical. However, given the subject matter (x-ray diffraction (XRD) is not overly mathematical), you surely won't be stuck for hours. I am a pretty mathematical person, and if I edited this book, it would probably be one of the best.On the plus side: this book has some awesome prose. It really is well-written, and, to confirm the words of another reviewer, Cullity is able to describe mathematically complicated ideas in words. THAT is laud-worthy, in my opinion.Also on the plus side: experimental techniques are included, the applications of XRD, and many useful tables of information. This book is essential for the experimenter!If it was more mathematically sound, heck, I'd give this book five stars, easy."
4,Practitioners title,This is a good reference book for persons who does x-ray diffraction studies. It tells all the practical things without going too deep into the theory.
1,This book is very terrible...,"Of course, This title is very great book for second edition. but third edition is very terrible book.Stuart Stock is made gabaging about third edition.because, so many misstake editing and Things have become topsy-turvy.and so lost chapter reference.and second edition is composed 3 partsbut third edition is not yet.Why do you editing this?I'm not understanding it..."
1,Poorly Edited Edition,"Cullity's expostion of x-ray diffraction is excellent, but the third edition, as noted by other reviewers, is missing all chapter specific references. If you're interested in this title, try to find a copy of the second edition."
4,Poignant and beautiful from the lone star state,"In 1996 while making a trip back home to Austin, I was browsing at Waterloo Records when I found this treasure of a CD! With the voice of a Texas angel - a beautifully timbred soprano without too much nasal or tremelo - along with some very original, cliche-less song writing - very raw, very beautiful, very Texas! She didn't really need Waylon or Willie to get my money!"
2,The battery isn't the problem,"I've had this phone for 4 months and I now get about 30 minutes out of the battery. The battery isn't the problem, it's the charger. I'm an electrical engineer and I've seen this before. When the charging circuit doesn't shut off it will overcharge the battery. THIS IS A VERY BAD THING! A couple of times when I got home from work I picked up the handset and it was HOT. The charger didn't shut off and was cooking the battery. Replacing the battery pack is only a sort term solution. You'll probably have to replace it again in another 4 months. For $250, I expect better.Also, I hate the fact that you can't play messages while the handset is in use. That's incredibly annoying. There is also a background hiss that wasn't there with my 900MHz phone.I do like the looks but this unit has too many problems."
5,One of the best cordless phones on the market,"I've owned this model for close to two years now and I absolutely love it! It's small, light weight, wearable, clear and full of features. The one complaint I have about this phone is that I'm having difficulties with some of the buttons on my headset keypad. Since I've used the phone so much the buttons I press the most frequently are wearing out and my LCD display is fading slightly but this is not going to stop me from buying the same model all over again. The other thing I would like to mention is that this phone has taking a beating! I've dropped this phone more times than I would like to count and each time I just picked up the phone and kept on talking."
2,Beware - Don't buy this phone,"This phone has been a disaster. The reception drops off after 30 feet (line of site) and is totally lost after 40 feet. It doesn't work upstairs in my house. If you cradle the handset between your head and shoulder (while carrying children, cooking, etc.) two problems occur: a) your head presses the ""hang up"" button disconnecting the line and/or b) the phone is too short so when you cradle the phone your cheek blocks and covers up the microphone on the handset and the person on the other end of the phone call cannot hear you. The phone only works when you hold the phone with a hand and consciously hold it slightly away from your head so as not to hang up or cover the microphone. Even so, the ear speaker must be perfectly aligned with your ear or else you can't hear the phone. This is very annoying. AVOID PURCHASING THIS PHONE. CAVEAT EMPTOR."
3,"Okay, but far from perfect","I have had this phone for 3 weeks. Just like many other user's experience, the life on the battery is so short. My other Panasonic 900 MHZ could last 5-8 days without re-charage under normal usage. But this ""elite"" 2.4 Ghz hardly last more than 3 days. The sound clarity is good. But it does not have the range or distance impression that I was expecting. Pretty much or even a little bit worse than my old 900 MHZ analog. Well, this phone definitly has best look among others. Other than it's look, I would rather stay with a 900mhz digital version. By the way, the support representative at Panasonic have outstanding performance I should say. I called them about two weeks after I bought the phone and reported the battery problem, they used ""UPS 2 Days Service"" to send me the replacement battery. Quite outstanding job on this. Unfortunatley, it is very likely that there is some designing problem on battery charging machanism."
1,Junk,"Like everyone else, I've observed problems keeping a charge on the phone for more than 30 minutes. It's very unlike Panasonic to put a full-featured phone on the market, that is basically defective. .... The feature set is second to none, but how could they overlook the charging problem? ...Stay away from this phone."
2,Do Not Buy,"I was attracted to this phone because of its cool looks and features. I ignored the reviews.After 3 months, I am returning the phone (luckily I bought the 2 year warranty). Now, the phone holds charge for hardly 30 minutes.Conclusion: The phone is really attractive, but its performance is pathetic. Panasonic should discontinue this model, and stop cheating its customers."
1,Phone went dead in just over a year...No help from Panasonic,I have had this phone for over a year now and it is on its last leg. I have kept the phone in perfect condition and treated it with great care thinking that I would have it for some time. Well this week it started cutting out during calls and making strange noises while in the call. I call Panasonic and they claim that they have had very little problems with the phone and would not help me in any way except for me to send the phone back and pay $70 for a referb phone that could also go bad in a year. Panasonic needs to own up to the fact that they built a phone that has a major design flaw. I own thousands of dollars worth of Panasonic gear and if this is the way they treat a loyal customer I will not be buying there product EVER again.
3,Phone reviews!,"This phone has great quality sound. I like being able to plug headphones into the base--giving you two phones in one! Unfortunately, I returned this phone as the answering machine would get an annoying ""grown sound"" between messages on it. I bought the KX-TG2563 Panasonic instead (it does not have answering machine). Have had this unit for two weeks and so far no problems."
1,There is a REBATE for this phone,For all of the unhappy customers that have written a review for this telephone. Panasonic offers a $20 rebate if you purchase this phone between Dec.2001 - June 2002. Go to Panasonics website (www.panasonic.com) and search for this model (KX-TG2670N) Look through the topics for rebates. Select that topic and view/print form. Mail it in and get back $20. Maybe this will be somewhat of a vindication for all of your sorrows.
4,A Forgotten Poetess!,"Audre Lorde makes no apologies about herself as a Black woman, a mother, a daughter, a lesbian, a feminist and a visionary. Her poetry can be quite sensual and sexual at times. From the first poem entitled, ""The Black Unicorn,"" and the ""Solstice."" Lorde is quite a vocal female character regarding her opinions and views. In 1981, her sexual orientation was not in vogue to be talked about. Lorde's open-ness is quite apparent in her poetry but I would have liked to know some background information regarding each poem since I'm not much of a poetry reader or follower of Audre Lorde but I do admire her work. Too bad, she's gone because she would have been quite an influence in today's society and her voice silenced by her death of cancer robbed the world of her voice."
1,Save Your Money! Buy Another Phone!,"I bought this phone at what I thought was a bargain price a while back, but it turns out I got what I paid for. The phone worked alright for several months. A little echo on the sound quality, but otherwise decent--until it just stopped working. The base charges the phone, and indicates it is charged. But the phone no longer responds."
5,Could not be better.,"I had never heard of IBM phones previously. Believe me, I would buy or reccomend one to anyone now. Very good clarity, dependable with transmissions and pick-up. This replaces a phone of a different brand that I was never happy with."
1,Don't waste your money....,"I bought this phone at a local retail establishment and have hated it since I bought it. From day one the phone picked up a lot of static and interference when I was on a call. Occassionally it would clear up for a moment or two, but no more than that. Apparently callers could hear me fine, but I could not hear them at all. I also do not like that the keypad does not illuminate which makes it very hard to use at night or in a dark room."
3,"Good value, fun game","I bought this game to get a new mat to replace the previous official one that I destroyed after using it for years and years, the game was really a bonus. Generic third-party mats just don't seem to be able to stand up to the abuse that the Konami ones can.I like the song selection in DDRSupernova. There are some that I can do over and over and never get tired of. Others are just too slow to even bother with. There are some old DDR favorites and even a few familiar artists that you've heard on the radio.I use DDR for exercise and it's a little irritating that I can't progress through the game and unlock new things through workout mode like I could in DDRExtreme. I have to trudge through the game master mode without being able to track how many calories I've burned.I don't know if I would have paid full price, but it was too good of a deal to pass up. I'd say it's worth purchasing at this value."
3,"Game is good, could be great","I bought the game as an exercise aid, and it works very well for that. The main problems are (1) the dance pad slowly slips backwards on floor when in use, so arrows are not always where expected, (2) pad sensitivity issues, as I'll be standing in the center and the left arrow will register as being stepped on, (3) using exercise mode in the game limits other gameplay options.Still, it's a fun and effective way of exercising, and I'm happy with the purchase overall."
3,"Could be fun, too bad the little plastic dance mat doesn't work well.","This game is probably more fun for people who are better at it, but the dance mat is not very easy to use. Sometimes one of the buttons doesn't work at all during a song, maybe because the inside of the mat got moved around. There also aren't very many songs at first, although I think you can get more later. That said, it is an addictive game and can be fun. I would recommend the arcade version more than the ones for home game systems, but I guess it's nice to have one at home also if you can't always go to an arcade.EDIT: After playing this game some more, I think it probably wasn't worth getting because of how messed up the dance mat is. The buttons rarely work, and thats not enough for the game to be any fun."
4,Dance Dance Disappointment,"Overall, the product was fine as far as it worked and have had a lot of fun with it with my children and it arrived pretty quickly from the seller. The downside is that it was not in as good of condition as was advertised. I would think twice before buying a used item from this seller again."
5,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!,I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS GAME IS AWESOME I REALLY LOVE THE WORKOUT MODE IT HAD ME SWEATING LIKE I HAD JUST RAN 5 MILES...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE...EVEN MY 7 YEAR OLD CAN'T GET ENOUGH.
2,Pricey for what you get,"Cheap plastic looking for a big price. Returned it to amazon for a refund. Decided to stick with old shower head. Not to say it functions well, but I did not hook it up after I saw what it looked like."
2,"Missing pieces, open box","As a prime member who pays extra for fast delivery, imagine my surprise when I open my $90.00 shower head that's rushed out the door in a damaged box, opened with the pieces missing. I will put the blame squarely on the manufacturer, however Amazon needs to know that when a customer purchases a NEW product, they shouldn't be sent an open/returned/damaged one. So whats the point of paying 79.00 a year for Prime service, now I have to wait extra time to return this, and wait for a replacement. I should mark it up with a black sharpie so they can't send it to someone else!!!"
1,I feel gypped.,"Bought this because it was supposed to be a fabulous water-conserving shower head. But when I opened the package, the instructions actually advise consumers to install it WITHOUT the flow control first, to experience the full effect. Without the flow control, it is an unrestricted flow, and in my shower, that was upwards of five gallons per minute (yes, I checked). The flow control nozzle does, indeed, cut it down to 2.5 gallons per minute, which I thought was good, until I did some research online and learned that 2.5 g.p.m. is the maximum allowed by the U.S. for new shower heads. Most ""water-saving"" shower heads have a flow that is a full gallon per minute less than that. Yes, this shower head is marketed as a luxury item, but they're misleading folks if they suggest that it's luxury that's also good for the environment and your energy bills. ESPECIALLY if most folks are installing it without the ""optional"" flow control nozzle, as the instructions recommend.Can you tell I'm angry?"
2,Thunderhead showerhead,It's good and easy to install. The major problem is the dimples are constantly clogged. Constantly have to squeezed them routinely! Pressure is good but not great as well!
5,Best Showerhead ever,This is simply the best. Great value for the money and great quality. It's like being in a rain storm...
4,Very good but plastic attachment cracked,"I have been searching for a long time for the perfect showerhead. I like the rainshower type, and this seemed to fit the bill. I bought one and indeed it does what it says. It drenches you in water like a rain shower. I had 2 problems though. One, there were sudden changes in the water temperature independent of fiddling with the faucets. You're taking a nice warm shower and suddenly it's freezing cold water coming out. I understand that this is common with this type of rainshower showerhead. Second, I was making a tiny adjustment in the angle of attachment and the plastic ring that connects to the shower pipe cracked. Water was then pouring out the crack. I had to throw it away after having used it only for a few weeks."
2,Not Fully Adjustable - and broke after a year,"This was my first review: All the other positive reviews are accurate, but although it has 4 adjustable joints, none of them allow you to twist the showerhead from side to side. From the pictures, I thought the seam in the middle of the extension arm would allow twisting, but it doesn't.Now, after about a year of use, it has started to leak. The problem is that the part that hooks up to your metal pipe is not metal - it is plastic. Over time, it has developed cracks (maybe from the heat?), and has started to leak, and trying to adjust it only makes it worse. So, this would be great if they would just have the joining part made of metal so it would last and you could tighten it past barely finger tight."
3,RV use,I bought this for use in a motor home. It works better than the previous showerhead but was not up to the hype. We deal with various water pressures but this one works fine until I can find a more powerful head with low pressure
2,Not everything I thought it would be,"One problem I have with this showerhead is that in the picture it shows there is a middle pivot in the arm you can use to fold up or down, but the shower head I was sent has none; its just soldered in place. The pressure on the Thunderhead is subpar, not terrible but not anything resembling a massage. I will return this as I have gone back to using my thirteen dollar hand held shower head because I did not feel like I was getting all the shampoo out of my hair"
3,Review Between Trapezes,"I was looking for more in depth discussions. Stories by people themselves, how they felt and how they handles the transition from one life style to another."
4,Ideal guide for handling change or transitions in life,"Great book if you want to handle change or uncertainty better. The trapeze metaphor is perfect to describe that scary time of letting go of what you know, not knowing for sure what will be there to grab onto. Gail shares her tips through real life stories of people in situations we can all relate to. Her style feels like talking to a good friend. I give this to all my friends experiencing any kind of transition or change in their career or personal life."
2,Does not turn easily,"While the beater seems to be sturdy and finished nicely, I found that it did not turn freely. Too much resistance."
2,Junky,"Part metal, part plastic. Not a deal. It's probably worth about 89 cents. I don't know what to do with it. It's not worth returning, but I also feel like a chump for buying it when I should have bought a better one."
2,not the nicest kuhn rikon product I have seen!,"I was excited about this because we have been looking for a stainless egg beater. Reading the description, it sounded as if the handle was chrome and the rest stainless or at least better quality than just chrome. In fact the handle is actually plastic and there is far too much chrome making up the other parts. We really wanted something of better quality and all stainless. We're returning this Chinese made piece of junk."
3,Fair...,"Good quality, heavy duty.One big problem - the beater blades are round, rather than flat (not actually blades - they are just smooth cylindrical wires, very heavy and sturdy, but not flattened)....This causes egg yolks, for instance, to be able to slide off the beaters, rather than being cut apart by them as I would expect. Otherwise ok."
5,Kuhn Rikon Rotary Egg Beater,I went to many stores looking for an egg beater. The 2 previous ones I had fell apart (the last one on my first use). The Kuhn Rikon Rotary Egg Beater is wonderful. Very sturdy and easy to turn. I love it!
1,Armetale quits producing quality,"Armetale has been one of those great American companies that always produced quality. Their wares are now made in China rather than the US, but that didn't have to mean abandoning all standards of quality. They must have sold the company to someone wanting to exploit their great reputation but provide much-lower-quality products. The pieces we recently purchased might have been acceptable if we had not had a number of the Armetale pieces already, but the contrast in quality was stunning to us. We expected the heavy, durable pieces we had always purchased in the past. These are much lighter gauge metal, and seem ridiculous on the same table as the ""real"" Armetale we already had. Too bad! One more great American company bites the dust!"
3,"Good, but only in spots","I was rather looking forward to hearing this record after the glowing reviews posted here and after hearing ""Fat City Strut"" on the band's website. Unfortunately the promise of ""Fat City Strut"" is not borne out on about half the tracks on this record, so I would call this record something of a disappointment. The compositions are just too lightweight, and although the individuals in this band are quite proficient players, the overall sound of this record is just too poppy and ""smooth"" for my liking. Certain tracks (""I Can See It In You"", especially) would not seem out of place in a discotheque, circa 1977.All told, I like about five songs on the record, and they happen to be the ones composed by Topaz himself. What this band really needs is more of a hard edge in their sound; as it is, they're just some acid jazz softies with a bit of talent."
5,great album,"The best Topaz album in my opinion.Write out of Austin what a trip,all that multilayered sound without a lot of studio trickery,beautiful."
5,What a show!,Worth every penny. This show from 1972 has the Stones in Texas putting on one the best shows of their careers. With Mick Taylor on second guitar and much of their setlist pulled the Sticky Fingers era. A must have.
3,Good concert. Poor quality,"Rolling Stones playing their best songs. But the image is too dark, poor quality. This bluray is worthy just for fans."
5,Stones never better,"Despite the graininess and the video quality, this show is the cream of the Rolling Stones performing career. Music and spectacle, optimally combined and without and before the often distracting stage gimmickry that would come in later years, delivers the primal intensity any music fan craves for. Each number is a killer, and the show builds into a frenzied finale. At first, the changing quality of the video, as well as the alternating outfits, might be disconcerting. However, the show is sequenced seamlessly, giving the garments, at least, a colorful changing visual attractiveness. The inferior quality of some of the video is undeniable, yet the power of the performance and the music triumph here. I would have liked to have seem a couple of seconds more of a a clearly-shot Nicky Hopkins; otherwise, the ensemble players are well-represented. Jagger is unbelievable--all four of him! This dvd is a true treasure."
3,Not a great concert to watch,"Actually, I'm sure this would have been a very good concert to attend. It just doesnt translate to video very well. The band seemed a little slow and Mick didnt jump around much. The sound wasnt up to Blu-Ray standards. I should have just gotten the DVD, it would have been a little cheaper. I don't think anyone but the most die hard Stones collectors would benefit from this disc. I'm going to try A Bigger Bang because I do want to see some good Stones action. I know they are capable of better. And someone should have told Mick Taylor ""You're in the Rolling Stones - act like it"". Not much of a live performer that Taylor lad."
1,Blue-ray? Nah!,"I am not commenting on the concert but the media:This DVD is of low visual quality, I don't recommend you buying it if you expect Blue-Ray quality."
1,Major disappointment,The visual quality of the BluRay disc is horrible and looks no better than a poorly copied version from a VHS tape. The sound quality is certainly nothing to brag about either. I was only able to watch the first two songs before turning it off in disgust.
1,Horrible Film,I just saw this concert film in a movie theater 2 weeks ago. Save your money!! It is a horrible film. It is only 70 minutes long & leaves out many great Stones' songs that the group performs in concert. The group didn't have backup singers in those days so the songs sound different than the way the group currently performs them. See if you can locate a copy of their IMAX concert & buy that one!
5,great improvement on the bootleg,"This is a fantastic concert showcasing the Stones doing what they did best. I saw the bootlegged version of this show many years ago, and this official release is much, much better in terms of overall sound quality. Buy this or rent it -- it's an incredible snapshot of an incredible band during arguably their best period."
3,in concert with the Stones,"The Stones in concert is always a stimulating event, this one don't miss.We return to 1972, the ""Exile On Main Street"" tour, it's one of the hottest Rolling Stones concert.To the fan: buy it and enjoy it."
3,4 STARS FOR CONCERT 1 FOR CINEMATOGRAPHY,"The Rolling Stones legendary ""Exiles on Main Street"" concert tour of 1972 was filmed and released in theaters for a limited engagement 1974. Shot over four nights in Texas, the film has remained largely unseen - until now. And fully restored and remastered in Blu-ray!That said, it maybe hi-def, but this is a poorly filmed but rousing concert. Much better heard than seen. So turn up the volume and enjoy this classic Stones concert with its exuberant, pitch perfect performances of iconic tracks from the late '60s and early '70s. Forget the grainy, shadowy images and poor composition that does not do justice to the songs or Stones.Bonus material includes previously unreleased rehearsal footage filmed in Switzerland and interviews with Mick Jagger from 1972 and this year (2010. He also half apologizes for the bad cinematography and editing."
4,Blu Ray Version,"If you don't already have this one on DVD, I would highly recommend it. To many (including me) this is the best of The Stones performances available. I do have high hopes for the Some Girls era DVD/Bluray coming out later this year. I already had the DVD version of this but, after seeing ""The Song Remains the Same"" Bluray (a big improvement),I decided to get the Bluray edition of this one. Unfortunately, I don't see a huge improvement in audio or video on this one VS the DVD. I'm not saying , no improvement, just not a dramatic improvement. I'm sure it has to do with the original materials they had to work with so, I am not complaining about it. I am simply making the observation that if you have the DVD version, you might think twice about upgrading. It is affordably priced so, if you don't have either version, get it. If you are only familiar with the latter day Stones then by all means, you need it."
4,not all wishes come true,I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and have always craved a legitimate release and here it is. I will purchase this but it really needs a cd companion to go with it. I'd really love to crank up this fantastic live set of the Stones at their peak (God I miss Mick Taylor) while rolling down the highway. Hopefully we won't have to wait years for the cd like we did when Bowie finally released the wonderful Reality tour dvd as a two cd set. I know I can't be alone in this.
4,IT IS WHAT IT IS,"I will start by saying I have waited for this to be officially released for many years. I have had the bootleg versions from early vhs through the latest dvd (most of you know where I'm coming from). While this is a cut above the vhs boots, I was immediately surprised to find it is not a whole lot better audio/visual-wise than the 4reel bootleg dvd. That being said...they are still and always will be THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND IN THE WORLD...BUY THIS DVD!Upon reading the comments to this review, let me add I am not in any way saying this is not a MUST HAVE for any Stones fan. I believe the quality to be exceptional as an historic document from an historic band at the pinnacle of their career and nothing less."
4,stones at their peak,"Performance by the stones is good, especially mick talyor, but sometimes dvd frezes or skipps and this in a brand new panasonic dvd player, This seemsquite aproblem with some dvd's now days."
3,OK but not great,Surprisingly medium quality. Almost like a documentary style video but obviously shot on film. Mick Taylor was great . For what I paid as a used one this is very decent but I would not buy it new.
2,Surprised it got so many good reviews!,"I anticipated a great concert with Mick Taylor's skills being a big part of that anticipation. It was OK musically, but very poorly videotaped. The only focus was on Mick Jagger, in all his glory. I hard every saw another band member in the video at all! Seriously, It also had an ""old"" look to it. I believe the film's quality was the main reason why it was shelved until now. I was really disappointed. Mick even comments at the end, explaining how the filming ""back then"" left alot do be desired.(?) I wish I knew that before I bought it."
5,So Great I bought it twice!,"I had this CD when it first came out years ago, and then lost it. I looked everywhere...even online file sharing, and could not find it anywhere. Enter Amazon.com! This is one of the best CD's ever!!! Everyone recognizes Willie's vocal style, but with this album, you really get a feel for his writing style too. This album is out of print and will be very collectable...so buy it while you can! My fav songs: L7, Presidents of the USA, and Jesse Dayton."
5,This is one of my 'desert island' discs,"I'm a huge Willie Nelson fan and I love all sorts of music so this was a real treat. I bought it when it came out about a thousand years ago and it was money well spent. When I pull it out of the case, and listen to it, it never disapoints. If you get a chance to pick it up for $5 do it. You won't regret it.Thanks"
4,Awesome,"I recommend this comp. Some really good bands on here. I especially like the first track with Johnny Cash, kicks much behind."
3,"Reasonably exciting live tracks, absolutely no surprises","All of these 21 live tunes are unreleased. However, the actual songs were released on the 'Psychocandy' and 'Darklands' CDs. If you're looking for new songs, you'll find mostly covers here. (The JAMC were never good at acoustic covers, so even kangaroos can guess what 'My Girl' sounds like). Most of the tunes have the same straight-to-tape sound of the original CDs, except sloppier. Some intense tracks really do terrify (In a Hole, Taste The Floor, Some Candy Talking), I found the rest to be nothing we haven't heard already. OK, but hardly great."
3,A poorly constructed Conan book,"The writing is rather fun and lively with wit and good character development. You are easily sympathetic to the characters of the book. But plots holes take away some of the joy here. Something called the ""Living Wind"" features prominently in the book, isn't explained, shows up in the last two pages as a monster and is easily destroyed by a shaman leaving one to think ""so what?!"" The ""god men"" are never fully evolved, vague and almost irrelevent. Also, it takes a good half the book to get down to what it's about. Much too much time is spent with Conan roaming some tunnels. An average work."
3,Life Has Changed,I originally saw this movie when it came out in 1973 and found it to be thought provoking and humorous.Upon purchasing and viewing it in 2012 I thought it too melancholy for my taste.still a humorous look at movies of the early 70's.It seems in retrospect that the studio tried to reprise the Fonda-Sutherland pairing from KLUTE. Rent this film do not purchase.
1,Useless,"The ""lessons"" in this package are simply lists of words and phrases. Some of these words are in boldface, the CDs contain those words - nothing more - nothing less.The learning approach taken is to memorize without applying the knowledge in any context. If you have a fantastic memory combined with a lot of patience, you migh actually learn to understand some french by this package, but otherwise there are many better alternatives.The Pimsleur products are exceptional quality but expensive. For a more hi-tech approach the ""Learn to speak"" series by The learning company may be appropriate."
2,big ok but can't read in the dark,"I thought this would be a great thing for the TV room, so you could decide whether to interrupt a show by answering the phone, but you can't read the display in the dark."
2,What?!! No Call Waiting Caller ID?!?,"I bought this product because my old caller ID does not support call waiting caller id! According to the product description, it says it supports call waiting, little did I know, that's all it supports. But don't all units/phones support call waiting? What I'm saying is that this unit doesn't even support call waiting caller id---only regular caller id! I don't even know why they had to throw the term ""call waiting"" on the item description because it totally misleads consumers! So basically, my money was put to waste. I gave it two stars though because I liked the large display, easy to see the caller's name.I'm still looking out for a good caller id unit/box that supports call waiting caller id. It seems very rare and I don't want to buy a new phone just so I can use the feature. Don't buy this if you want a box that supports the new call waiting caller id feature, because this product obviously does not support it!"
4,deep red nasturtiums,"Unlike the other review, all my ""Empress of India"" seeds took (they did take a bit longer to germinate, and I had to be sure the weather wasn't too hot or humid and the soil wasn't soggy), but unlike my packet illustration, mine are all a VERY deep red and not a bright, lively deep pink as indicated in the photos and packet. So if you are planning your garden and are sensitive to coloration of the plants you are putting in, be warned that these are red nasturtiums."
2,Midland Products Dubious,"I own this weather radio, and it has great features...if only it worked properly! Mine has a tendency to come on anytime it feels like it, not just when there's an alert, which can be quite shocking in the middle of the night. I suspect a problem in the electronics. I recenty purchased another model made by Midland, and the buttons on it don't work right, so I'm going to have to return it to the store. I won't be buying another piece of electronics from Midland. If you're looking for a trouble-free weather radio, steer clear!"
5,This book is from experience!!,"This book will fill in a lot of spaces in your bodywork practitioner-ship abilities. He answers a lot of questions that he isn't exactly addressing-but then again-he is, speaking from the Heart and Guts of giving of his Life to you. You be the judge. It just took me a second, and it has made all the difference in my world. Lin Cornelison Creston, Iowa."
1,Junk,"This is the worst phone I ever had. I returned it to the store the next day after having the battery charged and tested the phone. The clarity of the voice is non existant. I just couldn't hear half of the conversation. I had to switch phones the first time I used it. I tried all the settings and channels and locations without any improvement whatsoever. My 2 years old 900 Mhz Lucent phone is just so much better. The phone is sure cheap at [price] and has some nice features but it just doesn't matter if you can't use it. Also, some caracters on the display are so small that you need a microscope to see them. I do not recommand this phone to anyone."
1,Avoid this Phone,"The only good thing I can say about this phone is that I liked the handset size (I find a lot of the newer cordless phones are too small, more like cellular phones). The worst part is the static!! I must have changed channels a hundred times, and travelled throughout the house and the static would never go away. People on the other end of the line said they could barely stand it. Also the caller ID is not backlit so it is extremely hard to read, even in room light. I think this phone has been discontinued because it's been heavily discounted at retail. Avoid this phone at all costs."
1,Frustration,"Buy this phone if you are looking for extra frustration in your life. It is very difficult to use. You cannot just pick up the phone and dial. Often, when attempting to dial OR just answer, it will display ""Try Again"". You can try again many times and get the same response. Answering a phone or dialing out should NOT be this hard. ""Try Again"" shouldn't be an option on a phone. We've been trying to figure the phone out for about a week now and have given up. It's being returned today. IBM is the one who should ""Try Again""."
1,Don't buy for the headset feature,"I bought this phone because I wanted one with a headset. I will be returning it. The headset is suppose to fit over your ear - however I was never able to get it to stay. Perhaps it is because my ears are smaller or perhaps it is because I wear glasses? My husband (bigger ears & no glasses) was able to get it to fit on his ear, however it didn't seem comfortable. Plus the mircophone was short - it didn't reached my mouth!"
2,IBM 3455 2.4 GHZ cordless phone with headset,The phone seems to be fair but not that clear. I only ordered this phone because it had a headset. It is nothing like any I have ever seen. It fits over your ear not your head and you can not hear anything. I believe you need to show a picture of the headset in the future. The other features are fine caller ID and call waiting ID is very easy to use.
1,"Poor sound quality, poor battery connection","I thought digital phones were the new rage, in part, because of the improved sound quality. If this phone is representative of digital phones, then keep your old fashioned ones. My analog phone has much better sound quality. Also, this phone has very temperamental battery connections, making a continuous charge difficult to maintain. And, why would they make the caller ID display on the underside of the phone so that you can't see who it is until after you've picked it up?"
3,"Has it problems, but is clear when working!","The phone has great reception, but I have had problems with the headset and base unit. The base unit seems to get out of snyc with the headset unit, losing the channel sync. I have had to re-sync it many times. The re-sync proceedure is to unplag the base unit, and unplug the battery in the headset, then place the headset back on the base unit for about an hour. I have done this many times, and finally sent the phone back for repair, about 2 weeks ago. I had to also send a check for... shipping cost for the repair/replacement. I have not received my repacement as of yet."
4,The reason that these songs are recorded on an independent label is because major labels were afraid to gamble on this album.,"This album by Willie Nelson was released in 1993. It is, for the most part, a collection for pop standards. But Willie did manage to sneak in a few non-standards, like his own compositions ""December Day"" and ""In God's Eyes"", and his friend Paul Buskirk's song ""You Just Can't Play a Sad Song on a Banjo"". But it's his album, so he can do whatever he wants, right? The songs are played in a pleasant country/jazz style that fits well with Willie's vocal stylings. Willie's fans should enjoy it."
2,williefan,The music and songs in this album are terrific but Willie's voice is not. He really struggles to reach and hold notes. I have been a fan for years and have most of what he has recorded. Something is amiss with this recording. I hope that whatever happened here is only temporary.
3,disappointed with Amazon pricing,I had canceled the original order for this bag @ $39.99 when I saw that it was advertised for $29.99 due to having seen it on the Today Show.Amazon charged the $39.99 anyway. Not good.
5,Villeroy & Boch salad plate,"I love the Villeroy & Boch wildberries salad plates, they are just the perfect size for a cocktail party, and I ordered to Amazon.com, they shipped the product in about a week and it was perfect for my party!!"
4,Infrared tank battles - wooohoooo!,"Tanks work as advertised. When the tanks are turned on, the sound of a diesel engine starting turns on. The tanks have tracks, the turret rotates, and they move quite fast. Controls are much as they would be on a tank, i.e., you move one track forward faster than the other on in order to turn. They move rather fast. When you shoot, the entire tank recoils. It's quite funny. Tanks are loud, but fun. No issues with ours yet."
5,"Great, true story","This, is a great, true story about a racing legend. I once saw Secretariat run and he was amazing then, but he went on to stun the racing world. The story is told in magnificent detail by someone who was there first hand with this beautiful horse and the caring and very interesting people who cared for him and helped him as he raced to glory. Great read."
4,Secretariat,I was enchanted with this book and couldn't put it down. If you're a true horse fanatic you'll enjoy all the info on the bloodlines of the champions that are such a big part of the story.
5,First hand account,"Nack isn't just reporting on research, he was there, he saw it and he lived it. You can tell that he loved Secretariat like a family member in the ""Pure Heart"" essay added to the updated edition. Lucien, Tweedy, and the greatest horse ever make for a great story and Nack's inside view of what happened is a priceless addition to the collective writings on the sport of kings."
4,Really good reading,This book was really very informative. Unfortunately I saw the movie first an it was not too much like the book.
2,Too many facts,There are way too many facts about non essential things and too little real story about the horse. Reads like a who's who of America's horseracing history without much passion.
5,My heart began to pound as Mr. Nack described what happened!,"Mr. Nack has done a wonderful job telling Secretariat's story, and what a story it is. I have allways loved Secretariat, but Mr. Nack has taught me about things such as running a ""twelve clip"" and changing leading legs in the turns and about lineage and people as well. But beyond that, it's great to read something about Secretariat that reaffirms how so many felt about the greatest horse of all time. I'm glad Mr. Nack loved that horse as so many of us did. He has written it into his book and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to run right out and find more books on Secretariat. Thank you Mr. Nack!"
4,"Just like its subject, a slow starter","As a casual horse racing fan, I loved ""Seabiscuit."" I didn't expect the same from this book, but it's still a wonderful story IF you can get through the first seven chapters. For me, those chapters, with all their details about Secretariat's forebears and the convolutions of his bloodline, simply bogged down. I was about to switch to a new book on my Kindle, but decided I'd stick it out. And I'm very glad I did. Once Nack hits his stride in writing about Secretariat himself, this book is easily a match for any sports book I've ever read. His descriptions of the upset in the Wood Memorial, then the heart-pounding details of the Triple Crown races, are wonderful reading.One Kindle complaint--the racing chart at the end is unreadable, even with the largest print size."
4,Superhorse,I enjoyed the book very much. Very interesting to see the difference between the book and the movie.Most of the first chapters in the book related the blood lines of various throughbreds before concentrating on Secretariat. Interesting but a bit more technical than I wanted to read.I highly recommend the book.
5,Fantastic book,"I wasn't alive when Secretariat was winning the Triple Crown so the only thing I know of him is what I have seen or read in the years following his tremendous accomplishments. This is a wonderful book for those who want to get the whole story of this magnificent champion. Nack looks at more than just the races that Secretariat ran in and won. Instead, he explores deep into everything surrounding Secretariat - the owners, the breeding industry, trainers, jockeys, hot walkers.....all of these charaters are brought to life in this book.William Nack is truly one of the great sports writers of his generation and in ""The Making of a Champion"" he has produced the definitive biography of Big Red."
3,Mr. Nack should have updated his book,"Secretariat lived for 14 more years after this book was originally published, which would have been good material for an updated version of the book. Secretariat sired several fine race horses (including Lady's Secret and General Assembly). He was the main attraction at Claiborne Farms, where many people from all over the world came to visit him after he retired from racing. He was racing's greatest ambassador. Mr. Nack should consider an updated version taking these things into account, particularly in light of his very touching article he wrote for Sports Illustrated in 1990 describing his life following Secretariat through his Triple Crown season and his profound sadness at his passing in 1989."
4,Excellent book.,A wonderful book about about a truly great horse. The story may also be as good as the horse. Everyone that enjoys horse racing should read this book.
3,Not bad - needs more excitement or oomph to hold the reader,"This is a long book that covers a lot of info about Secretariat and some unnecessary miscellaneous rambling. Could have been trimmed up in many places and more oomph added. However, anything Secretariat is always good."
5,Super Book !!!,"This is one of the greatest horse racing story of all time. A colorfully written, true to life, tale of one of the greatest race horses that ever lived. Secretariat will hold you from the first thrilling page until the last. This is a wonderful story that tells about the life struggles of a horse owner trying to become a success and about the horse itself as he proves himself in the eyes of racing fans around the world. Secretariat will gallop his way into your heart in this warm, love story between a horse and the woman who loved and believed in him. This is a must read for horse lovers and racing fans everywhere."
3,"Good, not great","Parts of this book are excellent, especially those parts of the book that focus on Big Red's races, especially the Triple Crown races. Other parts get painfully slow, however, such as those dedicated to the history of thoroughbred breeding, Secretariat's lineage and the horse's syndication. The lineage section reminded me of the ""begats"" section of the old testament. All of this information was relevant and needed, the sections were just written in a manner that was quite boring. The author was also unnecessarily flowery at times in his descriptions.All that being said, it is a decent book, especially in light of the lack of other books about Secretariat. It is certainly a worthwhile read, I was just not overwhelmed with it like many others apparently were."
4,A wonder horse and he's for real,I think this book is really for horse owners who want more in depth info than the movie gave as it traces the horse lines intensively and I was surprised by how the owners really ended up owning Secretariat as the movie twisted that part. The book's info about it is even more amazing. If you are not a horse owner some parts of this book might bore you as it draws out the horse lines and the syndicated owners info.
2,Felt a litle lost,"If you don't know a lot about horses and horse racing, parts of this book can drag and be hard to follow. Still, I came away feeling that I did learn something although I don't ever want to read another book of it's kind again."
1,Great book but my copy is defective,"First of all let me state that this is a terrific horse racing book, well researched and written with evident love and passion for the subject. Unfortunately the copy I received is defective. Page 132 is followed by page 177; the pages then continue in sequence to page 244, then page 177 appears again and the pages are in sequence to the end: page 364. This is the copy with the green band at the bottom and a front view of the galloping Secretariat on the cover, which appears on this page at the time of this writing. It is published by Da Capo Press, second Da Capo Press edition, 2002. If you buy this book check the pages when you get it to see if it needs to be returned, pronto. I bought this several years ago so I don't know if Amazon.com will give me even a store credit if I return it...or will they?"
2,Doesn't compare to Seabiscuit,"I wanted to love this book like I loved the Seabiscuit one.If you're in the market for a biography that is primarily a listing of events, racing times, dollars spent & agonizing projeny data then this is the book for you!If you want to 'know' the characters who surrounded Secretariat and understand how this team came to be this is not a book for you. The racing scenes were both yawn inducing and the most exciting portions of the book.Again, if you loved Seabiscuit this is not the book for you."
1,Caution: DirecTV no longer updates this receiver,"I recently purchased one of these units. It has version 40b of the firmware. DirecTV used to send updates to the firmware twice a day. These downloads ended on 6 Aug 2001. As a result of not having the latest software for the DTC100, I cannot properly view HD material on my InFocus LP350 projector. In researching this problem, I have discovered that the old software also causes incompatibility with other HD displays (Mitsubishi, for example)."
1,"Great pictures, Easy to Work, Bad Factory Warranty","You get a one year warranty on parts, 90 days labor. I bought my unit in August of 2001. It just went out April of 2002. It started whistling and then wouldn't broadcast HD signals, it would crash and restart. I called RCA and they have a flat fee exchange. They dont even consider any facts, it is just straight exchange( by two options they have.) The unit cost me 599.00 originally and now 6 months later im paying 129.00 to get it warrantied. I would not reccomend this until RCA gets with the program. I would of rather had the Toshiba or the Sony unit for that price."
2,It broke in nine months,"Given the limited availability of HD programing available, we early adopters of such products must be masochists. Cleverly (I thought), I bought the extended warranty, just in case. So, when my digital audio went out 9 months later, I didn't worry too much. It took me 4 more months to figure out that it was the DCT100, and not the cable or the audio receiver that was bad... So, 2 stars DCT100 (which was cool, when it worked), and one star..."
1,RCA DTC-100,I have had 2 of these units replaced in less then a year. First time it was because no DTV signal second was no OTA signal. First time it was under warranty and second time it cost me $239 to get it fix. Thomson who makes this for RCA would not fix under warranty because the second unit had a 90 day replacement on it. I have had a lot of DTV receivers in the last 4 years and this one was the worst!!!! Stay away and spend your $500-600 somewhere else!
5,"David Beckham, David Beckham Instinct","I LOVE this ! It gives off a Fresh-Clean scent that's not too overwhelming & everytime I wear it I get AT LEAST 4 or 5 compliments a night on how good I smell.... it's a great conversation starter....& for the price how can you go wrong !?! It even gets to me FAST ! Waaay before the time that's posted on the email they send you....bottom line, GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT COMPANY, & FAST DELIVERY !"
2,Smells great but doesn't last.,"I have gone through 2 bottles of this stuff, and it does smell great, but it just doesn't last very long. I spray it on in the morning and it is gone within 4 hours. Like others have said, for the price, you can't really expect a super high quality fragrance though."
5,Great!,"Bought this because I had previously gotten one for my dad from JCPenny, but for some reason they're not carrying it anymore and he really wanted another bottle. Took only a few days for it to get here and it was packet great. Would def. buy again."
1,NOT HAPPY,I was disappointed with the quality of this fragrance and in a way that justifies the low price. A perfume is without any doubt a personal preference and this is really not for me. I was with the expectation after reading a few good reviews that this could be a good buy but for me it was a big disappointment.
3,GREAT scent...for a few hours,"This cologne is one of my go-to's. I use it off and on, and cycle with either this or Tommy Hilfiger for men.So, if I use it so often and recommend it, why the 3 stars?Because, as great as the scent is, it only lasts a few hours. I like a cologne scent to last a full 8-hour working day. This is nearly non-existent by lunch.But still, it's one of my favorite scents, and I spray it on twice a day (which means I run out twice as fast...Oh wow...maybe that's the marketing ploy all along.)If you're into a great, but not overbearing scent, give the dVb a try. It's wonderful and subtle. Just be prepared for it to wear off fairly shortly."
5,"Simple, subtle and inexpensive","I've been using Beckham's Instinct for Men for about 3 years. No metrosexual me, and heavy use of colognes or perfumes by either sex triggers an instinctual avoidance response (and a minor asthma attack) on my part. But a couple of spritzes of Instinct after a shower seems just right for me and my chemistry. It is a rather subtle scent that blends with rather than overpowers one's natural chemistry.My wife hates colognes and likes this on me. Enough said.JM Tepper"
5,great deal,"At $16 for 2.5oz, this is an incredible deal. When this first came out, I purchased some at Rite Aid in a promotional pack that included body wash, and it was $35. I went back last week for more and found that just the spray alone is now $37 on sale, and that's at Rite Aid! To be able to get it here for $16 (down from $55 supposedly) is awesome. I purchased 2 while the deal's still available. Love the smell of this - not overpowering, and not one of those heavily musky ones either - just a nice fresh scent that lasts well. This and Davidoff Cool Water are my favorites."
3,"Smells good, but scent wears off quickly","I got this for my husband and when he initially sprays it it smells great, but within 30 minutes I can no longer smell it. Even if he leaves for awhile and comes back home I still do not smell it. I do love the smell, but he's going through it quickly since he has to continue spraying! I am 27 and have a strong sense of smell, so it's odd to me that I can't smell this for very long!"
4,Yummy,Makes your man smell delicious! Loved it. Smells amazing and looks great. Made a great gift for my love. =)
3,Good purchase,The fragrance is very good. It lasts for around 3-4 hours even if we drive two wheeler or move outdoors. Considered to be a long period in Indian conditions.
5,"Seasons 9-10, Complete","The first book covers seasons 1-8. This book only covers two seasons: 9 and 10. Each episode gets a two page spread, while many of the episodes in the first book only had one page. This allows far greater detail to be covered.I keep all (currently) three books near the TV, and I'll review the pages for each episode before I watch the rerun. In doing so, it opens my eyes to a lot of the little details that I missed the first fifty times I saw the episode.Essentially, this is the owners manual for seasons 9 and 10."
3,Why now?,"Although the content is very good, I don't understand why they had to put out a second edition that contains only two seasons. If they had just waited a little longer and included at least 4 or 5 seasons, I might have been happy with it. We're hungry but we get hungrier when forced to wait. We're not rich, you know!!"
4,Simpsons Mania,"This book is really cool for people who watch the show ocasionally or people who are Simpsons collectors. I really liked the book. It had tons of cool things to look at and read. If a new one came out, I would definately buy it too. This book is the greatest."
4,this is one of my favorite books,"I love this book,it is great to have if you are a simpsons.If not just check it."
4,One Great Simpons Book,I thought that Simpons Forever was great. It was not as good as the first one considering it only has two seasons. I think the bio's on the side were great and helpful. The only other problem was the storys. They were too short Otherwise this book was GREAT!
3,"Been there, seen that, not so funny anymore!","The first guide - and ""The Simpsons"" episodes it covered - was great! But with time the good ideas have disappeared. The newer episodes are just not so funny anmore - that's why my enthisiasm for the book suffers as well."
3,It seems a little forced!!,"I think this sequel of ""A complete guide"" was something like ""let's make another book, make little reviews of episodes and add some bad stuff at the end and between seasons and PRESTO!"".I still like it though, but it doesn't feel quite right, by the way BEYOND FOREVER it's a better book, they did put more effort in it."
4,Good Source for Seasons 9 & 10,"This book is one in a continuing series of reference for the show. In particular, this book deals with episodes from the ninth and tenth seasons of the ""Simpsons."" Here, we are given summaries of each episode, as well as the chalkboard and couch gags that came along, and interesting trivia about the episodes. If you own the first one (which I suggest you should, if you don't already)), I would definitely recommend this book, as well as to any person who loves the show."
4,D'oh!,"The Simpsons Forever! A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family... Continued is just what it sounds like. However, unlike the first book; this one only has 2 seasons in it, covering all the episodes from #9 and #10. The book starts off with a forward from creator Matt Groening saying that ""we could've just stuck this book at the end of the last book and charged you for it again, but you fans deserve better."" Nice thought, but they basically did that anyway. This book is $[money] for two seasons, the other one is $[money] for 8 seasons. There's no reason at all why they should be charging us more than $[money] for it...But, if you're a Simpsons fan like me, you'll shell out the money... And don't get me wrong, it's a great book, just like the first one. If do you have the first one, you'll need/want to get the second one, just be forewarned about the price tag..."
3,A Decent Continuation...,"This book picks up right where the last one left off....starting with season 9, that is. This time around, there is much to follow. Episode summaries, couch gags, Homerisms, and a few other bits. My personal favourite section would be the tribute to Troy McClure, in honour of the late-great Phil Hartman. The book is pretty full for the fact that it only covers two years worth material. I personally would have waited another couple of years before putting out a follow-up, but when something is hot, best thing to do is market it. If you're a die-hard fan, I'd say this book is a must have. If you're a once-in-a-blue-moon viewer, acquire the book by some other means. Either way, you won't be disappointed."
4,"A quickie, but useful.","This book was a quickie, but I'm glad they put it out. So where are the rest of the volumes?The kept the same format as the first book, and have a nice tribute to Troy McClure, played by Phil Hartman who was murdured.Really, the ""Simpsons"" is a cultural phenomina on the level of the BEatles or Star Wars."
3,Not all the new episodes were in here,"When I bought this book, which is, nevertheless, a useful trivia book, my wife was a little upset to find out most of the newer episodes she remembered were too recent to be included. It's a very thin book, and perhaps they will come out with another one to combine with this one to have it the same amount of material and more up to date information."
5,The laughter continues . . .,"I already own the first Simpsons Guide, which is why I was pleased to discover that this one was available to continue the hilarity of the most recent seasons. Profiles on new characters, song lyrics, scene snapshots, and much more, this is a great resource book that you'll find yourself reaching for again and again."
1,VERY VERY WEAK ACID NEUTRALIZER,I am very disappointed in this product. I just received it last night and test it against AlkaPro Acid Neutralizer (product I am currently using). It took at 20 drops of PH Protector Drops to bring 4oz water to PH = 9+.....whereas it only took 3 drops of AldaPro to bring 4oz water to PH = 10.I don't think it will take very long for me to go thru each 1.25fl oz droppers. I am VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED in the quality and price.Tien Tran1/25/2011 3:25PM
5,BODY RECSUE,MY HUSBAND TAKES THIS PRODUCT. HE HAD A TONGUE THAT WAS SORE ACROSS THE TIP AND HE TAKES 8 DROPS EVERYDAY IN A GLASS OF WATER AND HIS MOUTH FEELS SO MUCH BETTER.
4,Son loves it,My 13 year old son who is big into the new Transformers is highly impressed with the orginal. He received this for xmas and it is still in his DVD player.
4,Transformers G1 season 2 volume 1,"It is great to see all the old stuff back what I used to watch with the banners 'the transformers will be back after these messages', great to see and hear the voice that goes with it.Much errors are fixed but some still remain and you will spot them better than back in the days but it is a great set with extra's and nice art work.If you like transformers G1 and want the old series without the Rhino mistakes and know that not all episodes are digitally restored and therefore don't have picture quality as Rhino but still used the original 35mm tapes (as much as they could) this is worth ordering knowing this set comes as close to the series they broadcasted."
5,Transformers S2 V1,"Excellent Box set. Love all the Transformers and looked a long time for this set, but they are hard to find. Huge Transformers fan! Can't get enough of them."
4,A valid and pleasant album.,"The power and beauty of Phil Perry's voice shine on this selection of classics especially on the Spinners' ""Mighty Love"" and a breathtaking take of ""If You Don't Know Me By Now""..On ballads like Tony Braxton's ""Unbreak MY Heart"" and Smokey Robinson's ""Just To See Her"", Phil Perry combines the delicate yet passionate vocal with SOUL.A worthy successor to his first album of covers in the seriesThe Classic Love Songs.It's a valid and pleasant album that will appeal to both Soul and R&B; fans.Only a dash too predictable."
3,Could have been better,This CD was not Phil's best work. His voice is so much better than the way it came off in this offering. I feel that he should get back to the producers that made his first 2 CD's and who had a better take on the pulse of what TRUE R&B; is.I still love you Phil. You are one in several million and I know that you are a blessed balladeer. Luther is now gone and the slot is very opened right now. Go For It!
4,When R we gonna get new material,"I haven't listen to this album but I'm sure for us Phil fans its great. But I'm kind've tired of all the remake albums. I love Phil's originial material alwhole lot better than the remakes (Same goes for Maysa). F.M.L. (My Fantasy, My Mystery, My Love) is one of my favorite songs. This is why I feel that music is about 75% songwriting and 25% voice. I guess its really, really hard to write a good song these days. Anyway, I would love to see Phil live and probably will in the future since he does tour alot. For the Phil fans who gets the album, enjoy."
5,Gomorrah has Arrived,"In the last chapter of his compelling book Judge Robert Bork asks the question, Can America Avoid Gomorrah? I think the answer to this question is pretty obvious by now - No! He hopes for revival of some sort in America. Good luck. I don't see it coming from the examples he gave in his book (Promise Keepers, Catholic Bishops, talk radio, etc). From my perspective, there is not much out there. Maybe the Tea Party movement or some other grass roots movement will ignite that spark. But honest leaders in government like Ron Paul are few and far between. Judge Bork is moderately optimistic in the long run because he believes that traditional American ideals are still alive within the hearts of most people. Maybe he's right. I fear, though, that things will get a lot worse before we see the light of day. Thank you Judge Bork for a superb analysis of contemporary American culture."
1,Scarier than the latest King novel for sure!,"This book, while mildly entertaining and interesting to read, makes me glad as an American that Bork is not on the Supreme Court. Bork advocates several controversial policy initiatives, including partial government censorship of various forms of expression, and perhaps most controversially, he advocates allowing Congress to override any Supreme Court decision (a gutting of the Constitutional balance of powers that should send any American -- conservative or liberal -- to the medicine cabinet!)"
1,Ramblings of a Bitter Man,"This is a sad book. It is a record of a man driven by bitterness, resentment, and defeat. This is unfortunate for the conservative movement, which should be looking for positive images and ideas that move the us forward as a nation. Bork has always been on the extreme right, and those who live on the edges, both liberal and conservative, tend to feel marginalized and resentful. Unfortunately, this manuscript is more insightful about the psychological state of the author than the state of our nation."
3,A must read for the Knowledgeable conservative partriot,"Judge Bork has made it perfectly clear when and where many of our current social problems originated. His insight into the legalistic maze of how America began it's slide into deviance will without doubt help many bring into focus where we went wrong as a nation, a people and as individuals. I enjoyed this book in full measure up to about the middle. And in that portion I believe there is invaluable background knowledge that every reader can take away and make good use of. After that it becomes a little dry and repetitious. Although some might find that is not the case. The fact remains that until the Administrative and Legislative Branches of our Government find the wisdom to place individuals like Robert Bork upon the Supreme Court. We will continue to be lacking in moral, ethical and constitutional philosophies and principles in our judicial decisions. The people harvest the failures identified in this most excellent book."
5,I was there...,"I was there, on campus, in '67, '68, and '69, wearing an ROTC uniform 2 days a week. The problem on campus was exactly as Judge Bork describes it. One could not have a rational discussion with the leftist students. They were morally superior, and just by dedicating myself to defending the Constitution of the United States, I was deemed their inferior intellectually. I was also less advantaged economically than they. We who served will not forget the arrogance we faced. Judge Bork nails down the moral difference between the privileged leftist children of the '60s and the less privileged who have made it on their own. We can never forget."
2,"Bork's book is based on ideology, not thorough research.","I am a conservative myself, and hoped that Bork's latest offering would provide some keen insights into what truly caused the perceived ""moral breakdown"" of society. Instead, Bork gives a hollow diatribe against everything from the Supreme Court to popular music. As an observer of our court system, Bork's findings on the judiciary do have some merit. But his railings against modern music, for example, are baseless. Who's to say, for example, that George Gershwin has more musicianship than all current songwriters? I recently heard Bork refer to Marilyn Manson as ""gangster rap,"" proving that his knowledge of basic popular culture is quite lacking"
1,More pathetic right-wing drivel,"This is, simply, the worst book I've ever read. Period. No more needs to be said."
3,Anti-science comments ruin the book,"While America needs to be reminded that it is ""Slouching Towards Gomorrah,"" Bork's comments on evolution undermine his credibility as the messenger. His intent to promote religion at the expense of science does a disservice to both. Most major religions have come to accept evolution as the method by which their creator creates life. Pope John Paul II, in particular, has commented on the ""convergence, neither sought nor fabricated"" of evidence from many fields of study, for which evolution is the only reasonable explanation. America may be ""Slouching Towards Gomorrah,"" but creationists who would rather spread ignorance than understand science are not the solution, but part of the problem."
1,No moral high ground,Bork suffered from the closed mindset that everyone must believe as he does or is lost to reason. That attitude (currently shared by the likes of Thomas and Scalia) alone is sufficient for his rejection from consideration for the Supreme Court.His anti-science absurdist views on Darwinism and so-called 'intelligent design' exposes the fundamental shakiness of all of his reasoning.All too fitting that those on the far right would choose such an obstinate and angry man as their poster child.
5,"An excellent, valuable book.","Bork tells the truth with clarity and perspective, but unfortunately it is not what we would want to hear. Such prophets are never popular, and they may be perceived as bitter. But I am convinced that Bork speaks out because he loves his country and wants the best for it."
2,Bork has written a mediocre book...,"Bork is, of course, extraordinarily conservative (nearlyreactionary) and some of his proposals might be a frightto the more liberally inclined. A return of censorship andabolishing the constitutional review of the Supreme Courtare two suggestions; others are just as serious and justas deeply conservative. Bork clearly has deeply feltconvictions. He is passionate rather than objective. Someof his psycho-analyses of what secretly motivates liberalismare rather silly..."
1,Bork was the one who lost his moral compass,"Bork traces the moral breakdown of America to the 1960's. I think it was in the 1970's after Richardson and Ruckleshaus both resigned rather than perform the morally repugnant act of firing Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. Bork, that moral giant, then acted as Nixon's hatchet man and did the deed in attempt to cover up presidential crimes. For him to now denigrate the morality of others is a total abomination."
4,An excellent treatment.,"I think that this book is a excellent treatment and analysis of liberalism's trends and its underlying foundational concepts. ... The only problem I have with the book, is that he doesn't really offer specified ways to fix societal problems, but it is still a overwhelmingly good book.(And my copy ,is cut wrong, but that is not his fault)"
1,It's just one of those books,"It's just one of those books that you pick up, and as you read it you slowly being to understand what is wrong with the country. Its the people that guy into it.For all the vague pseudo-intellectual points and flowery language it is rather quite empty."
1,Bork always borks himself,"Bork borks himself by including outrageous statements that fly in the face of reason and humanity.Bork borks himself by his absurd prudishness, which makes him seem more woman than man.Bork borks himself by his anti-intellectual approach, reading detective novels instead of the classics of Western thought."
2,Seems Like a Comic Book,Well I surprised to hat this book was so short for one. And Then it seems to break off into like a comic book type of story telling. Truth be told I haven't really finished it yet because in comic book type format I have some what lost interest.I will of course finish reading it and report on my thoughts.
2,Too short / too small,"I've been back into comics in a big way as I fight kicking and screaming my way into middle agedom. I picked this one up in a binge of comics including Alias, Supreme Power, Marvels, Kingdom Come, Batman Arkham Asalyum, and the Ultimates.Next to Batman Arkham, this is my least favorite. It was too short and too small for the cost. It can be read in under half an hour which is a poor dollar per hour piece of entertainment.The story is very good, very much a story of Serenity and does well bridging the gap between the shows and the movies. However it is simply too small and limited to be remembered. I liked the story but I am not happy with the purchase. I plan to give my copy to SF friends of mine just to try to squeeze more use out of the $10."
4,More great fun for Whedon fans,"Anyone who is still angry at Fox for canceling Firefly will love this book. It captures the feel of the firefly universe and helps move the story between the TV series and the movie.The only down part is the lack of new stuff. Anyone craving new story lines from their favorite browncoats will have to wait and hope that this is only the first book of many.Also, brush up on your Chinese. You'll need it."
4,"It's a comic book, doesn't pretend to be much more.","I enjoyed the story for what it was. It did not have the personality that the actors brought to their characters, but the basic Firefly storyline was there. Of course it had the brief and mysterious qualities of a comic book, but I like comic books. All in all, I enjoyed the comic, the art, the prologue for the movie, and, most especially, the introduction by Nathan Fillion."
3,A bit pricey for a comic book,"A ""Cash in on the fame"" product. Not really explaining much as the title suggests. However, if it helps the possibility of a Serenity sequel.....keep buying. :)"
5,Excellent,"Excellent graphic novel, does a great job filling in the time period between Firefly and Serenity"
3,Nah,"Good artwork. Nicely done story. Nothing special. The whole point of this three-issue series (now collected as one) is to explain why Book and Inara don't start out on the ship at the beginning of Serenity. The rest of it is an extended chase sequence where the villains that were chasing River around in the 13-episodes of the series get to chase her some more. That includes the blue glove guys and the secret agent from the pilot (who turns out to be resiliant at surviving bullets to the eye at point blank range).Still, besides a nice Wash/Mal scene in the middle, there's not much to recommend this comic. The story isn't particularly compelling and the dialogue has little to offer.Personally, I was so worried that this was going to be the movie (instead of a prequel) that I looked at places with Serenity spoilers only to discover the spoilers that I really didn't want to know about. I kind of resent this series for that.Read only if you are a diehard fan. Else buy another copy of the DVD."
3,"Art is great, story is so-so","It covers what one episode would cover in about 10 minutes. But it's fun, and has really cool art, plus a fun intro by Nathan Fillion."
2,Nothing much happened.,"I was pretty let down by these comics. Pretty boring, and I didn't like the visual style. I won't be buying more."
2,The weakest piece of the franchise,"I'm a big fan of the show & film but this was disappointing. The story was too short to achieve what it set out to do (I read all 3 issues in 15 minutes), with the result that it seemed weak & rushed. The regular characters weren't given enough face time to enable anyone to have a real character arc. And some not-so-regular characters who were built up as a big threat in the series were depicted as incompetent mooks here. There were a smattering of very cool pictures and bits of dialogue scattered throughout this-enough to convince me that a well done comic could do justice to the Firefly 'verse. However, this is not that comic."
2,"Echoes of Joss, but not many","Disappointing. It looked like someone said, ""Okay, Firefly ended here, Serenity starts here, so we've got to plot out a direct line between one point and the other."" Very little of Joss Whedon's inspiration seems to be here, though the dialogue appropriate for the characters and setting. Wouldn't recommend this--if you've seen Firefly and Serenity, you're not missing anything by missing this book."
3,"short but decent catch-up from the TV series ""firefly"" to the movie ""serenity""","This comic sets the stage for the movie ""serenity"" after the abrupt cancellation of the TV series ""Firely"". Sanctioned by Joss Whedon, the comic is considered canonical for the series. The comic discusses issues such as the departure of Shepherd Book and Inara. The comic also covers the fate of the ""Hands of Blue"" agents that are chasing Simon and River.Overall the comic was beautifully illustrated. However, it sacrificed a bit of clarity for brevity. Sometimes the illustrations do not provide a complete enough picture to understand all the action without re-reading at times. It is a must-read for fans of the TV show who want to know all that happens prior to the movie Serenity to maintain complete continuity."
2,Firefly hasn't made a sucessful comic book transition yet.,Its is frustrating that Angle and Buffy have made such successful jumps to world of comics while the Firefly crew just flounders. I have found these comics convoluted and paced to quickly. While the writer does seem to understand the characters he doesn't take any anytime to explore their motivations or relationships. Firefly was always about the characters and these comics just felt like a generic slap dash action story.
3,Revisiting Whedon's world,"Like the series ""Firefly"", this book goes by too fast. There is a lot of the same old banter back and forth between the charactors as well as the typical action sequences. I know they have to sell books, but fans of the show and movie will buy it reguardless. This book takes place between the end of the series and when the movie takes place, and I wanted to see a little more about the true nature of the characters. Other than that, it is a good fast read, and I always enjoy the characters aboard Serenity and I hope Joss comes out with a few more adventures prior to the movie (he kills off Book and Wash!)."
4,what happened after the show got canceled,"This cool comic shows what happened between the end of the show firefly and the movie continuation, serenity. What happened the the crew, the ""hands of blue"" guys and any other story elements that might have been left out."
3,mediocre....,"...when compared to an episode of Firefly, but it is an interesting story. i think the artwork really holds back the impact of the dialogue. i think he was the wrong choice for representing these characters as we know them so well on tv and the brilliant film Serenity. i still think it is well worth picking up if you've done everything else the 'verse has to offer. but, this is by no means the place to start. fyi, there are quite a few charming moments between Wash and Zoe, and River has some memorable insights into sexuality that we see hinted at in the film. she is a grown woman!"
2,"Ugh, made for merchandising not fans.","Again I have to say this seems to me Mr. Whedon is just putting out some ""stuff"" to get the rabid fans to buy and these darkhorse comics fit the bill.The stories felt forced and not up to Firefly standards.I again have to say if Mr Whedon wants to create new stories and real novels, Great!! I'm all for it, but this kind of ""stuff"" just leaves a bad taste for the verse he created, and a bad feeling in your pocket.So my advice to Mr.Whedon if your going to do it, do it right, if your gonna keep ""plopping"" out this kind of product then do us a favor and just stop the merchandising madness because eventually your franchise will be hurt.This is just my opinion it matters naught in the grand scheme of things, just a way to save some fans some cash and disappointment.seriously turn loose some control, start looking at perspective writers and atleast get intopb or your franchise will suffer.You can call this what you will but it's a comic book."
3,Maybe best for the serious fan,"What's good: The illustration is competent and expressive. Figures and non-standard kinds of lighting are handled well, and the images carry the narration well. It's not enough to be the sole reason for buying the book, but good.What's not: I'm not sure I found a real story line anywhere.There are lots of little strands shaping up, but it's not clear where they came from or where they're going. This is common in the middle of a lengthy series where there's been a long time for characters and plot elements to build up. In ongoing sagas, ""continuity"" refers to long story arcs and not individual issues of a magazine. It's hard on the newbie, however.I admit, I haven't seen the show or the movie. I'm a total tyro in the Firefly/Serenity world. Fans will probably get a lot more of what's going on, and might like it a lot. It makes a cold welcome for the complete novice, though.//wiredweird"
5,great gift idea,bought these as a gift for xmas for a firefly fan. he loved them so much. got him the whole set the other serenity books as well. they were not as big and thick as I had hoped but he loves them anyway so we are both happy.
5,"Sweet collection of comic series, only smaller","This is awesome, especially for any Firefly or Serenity fan...really any science fiction fan. The only dislike I had for the product is the size, it is smaller than I was hoping, but not tiny compared to the comic, and the heavier paper is durable, but makes it less like the comic counterpart. Great quality, but not the traditional paper comic."
4,More of Mal's Misbehavin',"I got hold of this 3-issue TPB after reading the recent mini-series ""Better Days"" (also from Dark Horse). I was surprised reading the reviews of this collection that fans were disappointed.""Those Left Behind"" is far superior to ""Better Days."" As other reviewers commented, reading this one is like watching the show. You also see things that they may not have been able to pull off on the show (Zero-G, space graveyard). I also liked elements here that I've wondered about: what about rival merc teams? How close was Kaylee getting Simon where she wanted him? How do Book and Inara end up off the ship?Ultimately, this was a satisfying read. Unbelievably better than ""Better Days"" (which should be avoided). Also, the covers and variant covers by various top-of-the-field artists, in addition to the great interior art -- all of it is just purty."
2,"This book is ""incomplete"" because it is the first book in a series","Many reviewers seem to have missed that ""Those Left Behind"" is the beginning of a series. (Note the ""1"" on the spine.) A second three-part story, entitled ""Better Days,"" is due in March 2008 in single-issue form. A trade paperback version should follow soon after.Bottom line: The folks who are upset because this book is ""incomplete"" will be happy to know that the story isn't over. Personally I didn't care for the story enough to care how it ends."
3,"Sold as new, but not in new condition","This was purchased from Amazon.com LLC, not the Marketplace and I purchased it at the ""NEW"" price, not the reduced price of other sellers because it was a gift. It had a tear at the bottom edge and had scratches/indents on the cover as if someone had used it as padding underneath something they were writing on. The content of the book is what was expected and the gift recipient was excited about it, but I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the item."
4,Great Material,"Okay, I don't eat, sleep, and breathe Firefly like some of the reviewers do, but I loved the series and the Serenity movie. I think that this graphic novel fills in the gap between the series and movie quite well. Some of the artwork on the various characters is hit-and-miss. The artist(s) seemed to have an especially tough time with Inara. But, the story's good and the artwork is otherwise first-rate. I liked the full-page interstigial drawings of each of the characters, especially Wash, Kaylee, and Zoe. I hope that they're released as posters!"
2,Disapointed Firefly fan,"Look... I'm a HUGE Firefly fan. It's my favorite tv show of all time. Seriously! However the comic just didn't do anything for me. It's not that it was bad, it was just forgetful and short and uninteresting. I wanted to love it... I wanted to find something to fill the gap since Serenity, but this isn't it."
3,Left a bit too much behind,"As a fan of the Firefly series and the Serenity movie, I was looking forward to reading this, the story that links both together. However I was a bit disappointed with the comic, as the story jumps around somewhat, and feels a bit short for what needs to happen. Artistically it varies too, with close up characters generally good; but characters in the background losing definition. But it's hardly expensive so if you are a fan then you might wish to part with your tenner."
5,Best Leaf Rake,"I live in a very heavily wooded area and have used this rake for over 6 seasons without failure. I added a couple more to my tool rack, just in case they become ""hard to find""."
3,"not as good as ""oneword""","Yeah, but I'd buy it for ""You're Jakin' me around."" It pretty much describes my entire romanic life. I need to go make a sandwich now, but I'll come back later.yore fren,scuttles"
5,A Good Low-priced Phone,I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law. She has a harder time seeing and hearing on regular phones. This one has been working well for the last six months and is easy for her to push the buttons and adjust the volume.For the category of phones (price and features) this is a great phone.
2,Volume problems,"This phone isn't all bad but it's verging on unusable for me. It's a disaster dialing with a headset on, because the touch tones you hear when you dial will deafen you if you set the volume as high as you need to hear the recipient of your call. In many cases the volume simply can't be raised high enough and you can't have a conversation without switching phones. My headset works fine with a similar phone by another maker, and the problem applies without the headset too. Major design flaws include the absence of a mute button and a one-touch volume control instead of separate +/- volume keys. The one-touch key cycles through 3 or 4 volume settings and doesn't display where you are, so you never know if the volume is at max, and so that if you hit the button to hear someone better they are as likely to grow fainter as grow louder, which makes you miss more of what they're saying and infuriates you in the meantime."
1,It should be ZERO stars,"I used the phone for a few weeks, then put it away for a few weeks. When I charged it up to use again, it did not work. I called the customer service number on the phone and got a totally unrelated company who never even heard of these people. So I found a tech support email address on their home page (tech support for the phone, not the page's webmaster, I do know the difference)After a week when there was no response, I bought a new battery and charged it. Still nothing. That was several months ago and still no response from the support email either. It is obvious these people will try to weasel out of the warrantee by not ever finding out what is wrong with the phone. While I pursue it, I bought and am using an AT&T cordless phone. This one remaims plugged in just in case I ever reach someone who will want to try and diagnose the problem."
1,how can i review this item when it hasn't even been shipped!,"amazon, i would be happy to rate the telephone i ordered 7/27/06, but it has not been shipped yet! in fact, when checking the order status, you still state shipping date from 8/30/06 to 9/17/06 expected! well, i guess you just send these questions out to everyone regardless of the status. well i can't say i like the phone, i haven't even gotten it yet!"
2,There May Be Blood,"Pros: Cute, small, several length selectionsCons: There is only a guard on one side of the blades. That may be fine if you want a ""long"" trim, but if you're trying to get something a tad shorter, watch out! It's fairly easy to cut yourself - pain and blood in that sensitive of an area is UNCOOL. I would advise getting a trimmer in which the blades are fully covered by a guard."
1,Only lasted through 2 battery changes,"At first this seems like an awesome deal: you get a product that works well for a very low price. The only drawback is that it only lasted through two battery changes, and it doesn't take long to use up the batteries. I would recommend against purchasing this product, unless you are okay with it no longer working after minimal use. I will not purchase anymore Remington shavers."
2,good but don't get it wet,"Item works great but if it gets even slightly wet, for example when you clean it, it stops working. I've bought two but now I am switching to another because I'm tired of replacing it because I cleaned it or dropped it in the sink."
3,Good for trimming your n..s!!!,This is a really cheap trimmer and it shows..... but for what I know there is no perfect trimmer out there so I'll better save some money and get a cheap one. That said let me assure you that this trimmer does a fine job trimming all kind of hair. Just be careful if you take out the protected cover because is there for a very good reason.... to avoid you the pain of cutting your n..s or whatever part you are trimming. If you want a close cut you need to take that cover out but you better be careful with those sensitive areas.PD: I recently discover that this works great on my dog....Come to think about it... I'll better get another one just for me ;) LOL
2,maybe for use before wax,The remington shaver didn't give a close enough shave... would work ok for use before a closer shave or waxing...
5,great trimmer and it lasts,"I have used other Wahl products in the past and my problem with them is that they didn't last. This product works great and I've had it for many years already. As a bonus, it doesn't look like a men's trimmer."
2,more for business people,"As the name suggests, the book is more inclined towards marketing types. The book is not that technical and addresses the technology aspects of layer 3 switching using different vendor's implementations. The case studies aren't really practical. Given the recent advances in IETF standards in label switching, this book is little outdated.A little disappointing work for Metz, whose previous book was titled, IP switching.Bottom line, if you are developing the code you won't extract much out of it but it is good for sales/marketing people."
1,All theory,"If you are researching Layer 3 swithing and need some good references this could be your book. However if you actually want to make a descision wether or not to implement it, or how to implement layer 3, skip this book altogether. Much better book are out there for people who actually have to implement this technology."
5,Am an old Kristofferson fan,"Bought this right before seeing him in ""concert"". Glad I did, did not know how much his music had changed. Love him, though"
1,Unhappy that the product was never received!,"I have tried contacting Amazon three times to notify them that the product never arrived. I have yet to hear back from Amazon, very dissatisfied with their service and would think twice before I ever purchased anything else on line."
4,His Best Yet,"I bought this CD with some trepidation. He's older now (like me) and I was of the understanding that talent ""dimmed"" as you aged. Was I in for a surprise! This is truly his most beautful album yet. His new songs are magnificent. Somehow, and I don't understand it, this man's songs have touched every note in a life with its share of sadness and pain, and the desire to grow. Thank you Kris for a very beautiful album. And yes, I have bought the latest and can't wait to receive it and get it on the CD player!"
2,Beware of this radio,"Opon recieving this radio I have found that all of the sale litterateur fails to mention one thing; that all of the radios features, channel spacing, busy cannel lockout, scan attack, scan resume times, transmit time out timer, power save cycle time, and most of all the ctcss/dcs codes are NON-USER PROGRAMABLE. So I say what's the point of having a radio with repeater capabilities if the end user can not even program the ctcss/dcs codes without having to go find a Midland Tech. to program the radio becouse he's the only one who has the software and computer interface to do it. What happens the next time you want to change the codes? Or any of the other radio features? Buyer Beware."
1,Not what you wanted!,"I bought this radio on the bases it said it was usable with GMRS repeaters and had all of the ctcss codes. While this might be true, you can only use these features if the factory or a Midland Tech programmed it to do so. For the user who is used to doing his or her own programming and being able to change their radio as needed, this is not the radio for you, or me..."
2,Simply Poor,"These radios seemed to be an attractive purchase given the rugged construction, their re-chargeable nature, and that they support both GMRS and FRS frequencies.The fact is that there are no FRS compatible channels on these radios, that are evident. There is no mention of this capability in the owners manual that comes with each radio, which in itself is very poorly crafted.Finally, each of the radios comes with a seperate charger. I ordered two radios with chargers. One didn't work at all.Needless to say the were returned...."
5,A good tire for less $$$,"If you are a person who can't afford a Maxxis Maxx Daddy or Tioga Comp III, this is a good alternative. It performs really good like the Maxx Daddy. With it's old school MX tread it makes any bike look aggressive. It really makes a Dyno Nitro FS look aggressive. It would be the perfect replacement for an old school bike. It doesn't wear fast like a Maxx Daddy. All Pyramid Pro tires are manufactured by Kenda. Pyramid just resells them for a few bucks cheaper.This is a really good tire for the price."
4,Not the whole story,"The jump starter arrived very quickly and in good condition. I got this system for my wife after she spent 90 min trying to get someone to jump start her car recently. However, there are two issues folks need to know about before they buy this unit. First, You will need an extension cord (with only one female connector) to charge this unit. It does not come with a plug as part of the unit and the male prongs are inset in the unit preventing you from using a strip extension cord. Second, I would recommend also getting the 12V DC male-to-male connector. This will allow you to charge the unit in the car, while it is running of course, and it will allow you to jump start the car using the 12V plug. You can either make your own or I found one from Schumacher (SAC-109 part number). By the way, it does come with a plug-in light that can fit into the 12V adapter."
4,Good jump starter,"Have used three times,and it still has a lot of power.It takes a few hours to charge."
1,Incomplete product,Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find.I find it unbelievable that any company producing this item would not include 4 feet of cheap cord so the product could be put in service at once.
5,Defiant improvement,Easy to install and defiantly took care of poor quality signal. Works for me. I have 5 TVs running 3 ran off of one output two on individual outputs. Noticeable improvement on picture quality. I would purchase again or recommend to friends.
4,Does what it should,"Works great, even if it is a little pricier than I would like. The internal splitter is a great feature as it really cleans up y wiring. Just plug it in and everything works. Also works with cable modems so no worries there."
2,Expected much better,"After reading the positive reviews I was hoping this was just what I needed to boost the signal in two rooms. I previously used a cheaper unit (RCA VH100), which only boosts one line at a time- but even if I split the signal coming out of the cheaper unit (using a splitter to get two outputs), it's way stronger with a much better picture than what I get from this 4 port unit.Perhaps mine is defective, but it seems to boost the signal only marginally. I set it up as instructed, got the green light and everything- it just doesn't seem to do very much."
2,Not as good as the one we had,"We bought this item to replace an existing older RCA cable amplifier, looking for an improved signal. After using for a few weeks I have replaced with the older RCA amplifier which provides a clearer TV signal. On balance, it was not as good as the old unit we have."
5,Must have in reading collection,"This book is a must for anyone, reguardless of your color. I waited to purchase the book, but after reading other reviews I knew I had to have my own copy. My daughter picks it up and read it which opens up discussions for us. Recommended for anyone with children."
2,A decent attempt.,I got more out of 12 Things The Negro Must Do For Himself by Nannie Helen Burroughs (Circa Early 1900's)
4,"In the black, but not quite a bulls-eye","If this book is touted to be a roadmap for our communities socio-political and economic advancement I say that it is a good step in that direction. I would've liked to have seen it outline a systematic approach to achieving ""our agenda"", like maybe citing a policy we could all get behind first, and then when achieved, another that would set the stage for next policy issue. We're getting there though and I agree that The Covenant has gotten me and my family, as well as others I associate with thinking and planning realistic action that we can take as individuals. Bravo!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"After seeing the presentation on TVone I was inspired to read the book. It was, what I felt, about time that Black Leaders across the spectrum discuss topics that plague our communities. The book did not translate the empowerment of the telecasts. I felt short changed."
2,Waste of Time.,"If you're a reader, this book is a waste of time. If you are new to reading, then the book may have some value. I guess I expected more from Tavis, but this was some rehash [...] from the 60's or 70's, back then this would have been fresh information, but now its just more rhetoric.Tavis continues to preach to the choir. My suggestion, insted of telling us all the ills of america, and blaming the white man, tell us Tavis, how you made it. What kind of sacrifices you had to make, and what went into your decision making process to get you to where you are."
4,GET DOWN TAVIS!!!,"I probably would have loved this book more if I hadn't read it right after I read Kola Boof's autobiography (which was ASTOUNDINGLY and I mean SHOCKINGLY great entertainment).I'm so glad these type of books are available to us black people because we surely need it. We have a lot of serious thinking to do and I often fear that we, as a people are not gonna make it. God bless Tavis Smiley and Kola Boof for such important works that exclusively target the Black Condition in an unapologetic way. We need that."
3,www.sportofdistraction.com,"My only concern is that as reasonable and sensible it is to expect this help from governmental agencies, it's just not likely. The plan should consist of a reinvestment of affluent Blacks, in order to develop an economic body independent of the mainstream.Following that, and only following that, may an integration based on equality exist."
2,Good intentions,"I felt more compelled and inspired by ""12 Things the Negro Must do for Himself"" by Nannie Helen Burroughs. It was only a two and a half pages."
1,No problem that someone ELSE'S money can't solve!,"After composing this I thought, ""I can't post this because I will be labeled a racist or worse."" Then it struck me how much fear has been spread throughout America aimed at suppressing opinion. So I am going to post it for it is my reality and it is a free country, isn't it? ... This book simply and clearly asserts that other people's money can take the place of personal responsibility. Every chapter calls for someone ELSE to solve the ""victims"" problems. There is no pride or integrity in this route to prosperity. The route always has been, and always will be, personal responsibility and HARD WORK."
3,I was expecting a little more.,I liked the book in that it attempted to cover a lot of the issues facing African Americans today. I felt it could have been written a little better. As these conversations continue I will of course support these efforts.
5,Excellent Reading,Everyone should read this book and consider practicing the covenant. Great self-help book that should not be limited to race.
5,Covenant,"Well written, informative, educational and stimulating. Well worth the investment. Tavis is a gifted educated and well versed young man. I have several of his books and thoroughly enjoy reading his literature."
4,Dragonshadow,"A good sequel to Dragonsbane, I very much enjoyed reading more about the lives of Jenny and John in the Winterlands. What I like best about Hambly's fantasy writing is that the characters always come to life unlike the majority of books in this genre where the characters tend to be cardboard cutouts with a lot of snappy or tediously faux-Midevil lines. With rare exceptions, Hambly's books are the only fantasy books I ever read. Does anyone know know if the author is ever going to write a prequel to Dragonsbane? I would love to hear more about Jenny and John's early years, like the story of how Jenny trained her magic and Johns first dragon slaying, and of course about how they met. We get tantantalyzing glimpses of these stories in the other books in the series, but I would enjoy reading all the details."
1,Can't say enough bad things about this book,"Please, Ms. Hambly, stop. Don't know what happened, why you stopped writing fantasy novels, but it doesn't matter. Stop doing whatever this was. The original book was a classic, a book I'll return to over and over. This is a travesty, both poorly written, poorly plotted, and a betrayal of beloved characters.No one should read this book. No one should read any in this series but the original. However, if you've read the original, you'll feel compelled, it's that good. You'll rue the day you read this. Really."
1,I will never read this author again.,"Seems Ms. Hambly has noted that a certain bestselling SF authorputs his characters through hell. So, in ( ) fashion, she tries it (almost literally) with two of her most beloved characters, to the ruin of both the characters and her readers joy with the ""Dragonsbane"" universe.Martin she is not!This ""follow-up"" book (and the next) are as bad (IMHO) as the sequel(s) to ""Dune.""And like ""Dune"", I consider the story ""finished"" with the first book - and will read no more of either author."
3,Agonizing,"Don't get me wrong--I am a huge Barbara Hambley fan. Her Windrose Chronicles were some of my favorite books ever, and I've enjoyed all her other works immensely--until this one. The motivations of the villains were ignored or poorly explained, and the story meandered hopelessly at some points. Sadly, the book ended on such a depressing note that I felt it would have been better for all concerned if all the main characters had simply died--tragedy is one thing, but pointless suffering serves little purpose. This book left a bad taste in my mouth and regretfully ruined the excellent _Dragonsbane_ for me. I will be far less eager to rush out and buy Ms. Hambley's next work in hardback as I did with this one."
2,Not Recommended,"Although this book is as wonderfully written as everything else by Barbara Hambly, I found it to be incredibly depressing. There is not a single bright spot or light moment in the entire novel; it's simply one long desperate struggle that brutalizes the characters. The ending is a real downer. It's obviously going to have a sequel but at this moment I sincerely doubt that I will read it."
1,diappointing,"Drangonsbane was a unusual unexpected treasure. The characters were believeable, the situations understandable and the plot had enough twists to keep anyone interested. The characters were different which was one of the good points. In this book, there is much too much suffering and agonizing and handwringing. The characters are stuck in the worst of their agonies of the first book, and have not progressed, but regressed. The plot is too complicated to understand. Do not buy this! I love most of her books"
3,Good Sound but some feature issues,"While the sound is excellent with quality construction there are some problems with the features. The main one is the back light for the display is way too bright. Even on dim it is like having a headlight on in a dark room. Why couldn't the dimmer on the remote take it all the way to off. The clock has to be set! Why doesn't it use the Atomic Clock or the station transmitted time. This could be a great radio if they made the clock setting automatic, made the dimmer feature go all the way to no back light, and added the radio station xmitted info to the display. I can't say I didn't know what I was getting other reviewers have commented on how the back lighting is too bright and so I just taped a piece of card board over it."
1,Not a good clock radio,"Pros - nice sound, great lookcons - display is TOO BRIGHT, I have to cover it to sleep- cd starts at first song, even when snoozing starts at the beginning of the first song.- can't set volume level of buzzer- cd broke after 4 months"
1,Out of Box Failure,"Do not buy this product. Out of the box the CD player would not play the higher tracks on most of my CDs. These are CD's that work just fine on any other CD player I own, but on the TEAC the CD would only work up through track 10 or 11. After that I would just get a faint clicking noise. Sound quality when it did play was great, but I had to return my product and will not touch another TEAC product of any kind."
2,Annoying hum,"This was a nice unit when I bought it three-plus years ago. It brought in FM stations hard to receive and sound was very adequate. The initial problem I had was that it would not play certain pre-recorded MP3 discs I purchased and for some others, it would stop at a point and then some tracks later begin to play again. The sound is muddy for many of those purchased MP3s but I don't know if that's because of the poor quality of the discs or something within the amplifier. Having the headphone outlet on the back is another minor annoyance. But all those are minimal compared to the increasingly louder hum. It first started when listening to FM, but now permeates all the inputs.Has anyone else encountered this problem?"
5,Great Fun! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,"This flick is just plain goofy fun. Put your brain on hold, fire up some popcorn and settle in for pure goofy silliness. Don't expect it to make any sense, just sit back and enjoy the ride.Favorite scene: What better way to celebrate the loss of a dear friend than to have a beach party where she met her demise! There's A Monster in the Surf.... Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!Oh yeah, you'll be singing along."
1,Butchered masterpiece,"BGATM is a wonderful low-budget entry from the 60's heyday of exploitation anything goes insanity (Horror Of Party Beach, The Flesh Eaters, Brain That Wouldn't Die). Unfortunately three versions of this film exist and all three sport different cuts. One would need all three versions to create a composite of the complete movie. Sadly, the Image disc is missing chunks of footage and is far from the definitive cut of this amusing time capsule. I hope one day somebody will care enough to present this movie in all it's delightful splendor, but I doubt it."
3,VERSIONS?!!!!!,"Since there are apparantly other versions of this film, what is the point of releasing just one. It seems that there are others using additional and/or alternate footage. Either put together one complete film or give us all versions. There is also supposed to be a surfing sequence in color. This DVD is ok for one version but thats all. In B/W and widescreen."
2,Monster???,"I purchased this DVD in memorium of Walker Edmiston in light of his recent death. He was a great man and actor and I thought it would be nice to have something of his work on film. The film also has an interesting history (google it for fun.) I realized that this film was low budget and that monsters had evolved little as of the 1960's, but I hoped that would result in comedy. Such was not the case. I'm not really sure why anyone would want to buy this DVD. I was hoping for 'it's so awful it's funny.' However I found little humor in the shallow plot and dancing beach girls. The title of the film pretty much sums it up: ""The Beach Girls and the Monster."" If you're hoping for more you'll be sadly disappointed."
2,Tries too hard to be campy,"This film is monstrous. It is a mock hybrid of the beach movies and the last of the 50's sci-fi monster (beware of KCL beams) from the sea movies. Let's hope it does not turn out to be a psychological thriller where it is always the last person you suspect.On the positive side I did not see one butler in the movie. I just hope there is not an obligatory car chase. Don't be too disappointed if you find out it is the South American Phatiqua Fish.The presentation I watched is in monochrome. The few songs are hokey (probably by design.) Straps fall off shoulders but you will not have to cover your kid's eyes.The DVD has a few extras. Showing the highlights as ""the glamorous Watusi dancing girls form Hollywood's famed wiskey A-Go-Go Night Club."
1,"""There's a Monster in the Surf, yeah! yeah! yeah!","The above is the title to another song in this surf and monster opus of the California surf. After a girl named ""Bunny"" puts mustard on her boyfriends hot dog (he deserved it), he chases her but she gets away, right into the hands of Jon Hall (former Ramar of the Jungle) who is dressed up as a monster. It seems he resents the surf set for distracting his son from the scientific work which ole dad had planned for him. This is hokey stuff with bad acting, bad writing horrible music (although written by Chairman of the Board, Jr.) and girls whose wild bikinis are sometimes a little too stuffed. Still, its worth a look just for laughs."
2,not as described,"this product was not what it said it was, the description was lacking badly, the crucial info was not there."
3,Flip arrangements,"I liked the music, but I thought the arrangements often lacked.The treatment of Nobody Does it Better, for example, with its jazz-like interpretation trivializes the song - none of the passion of the original version.Some what the same thing for What I did for Love, with the little saxaphone tricks thrown in from time to time. Solos are OK, but sometimes the trills are annoying and interfere with the creation of the appropriate mood."
5,Richard Kughn's Train Layouts & Collections,"Reviewing this video remends me of how disappointed I was that Lionel Trains were becoming a thing of the past...they were history! Along come this man, an avid fan of toy trains for a lifetime, who is a millionaire. He begins solid manufatcure of existing trains, and then branches out into Lionel of the furure. Lionel's train manufacture was on a plane of quality and solidity as of the Lionel of the '40s and '50s. He brought Lionel to the attention of both runners and collectors. He's the man!! This indicates Mr. Kughn's love of all things Lionel. I highly recommend this product for every train collector and runner.Ralph M Wetzel3/8/2010"
3,A comrehesive research book but not a good book for resident,The book have reviewed in details every subject but the conclusion is not conclusive particularly for young anesthesiologists.
1,Just Blah,"I bought this book for about a dollar second hand and paid three or four dollars for shipping. It wasn't worth it. It was dull and uninteresting from beginning to end. I've read owners manuals for appliances that had more kick! If someone gives this book to you for free, it still isn't worth a read."
5,Excellent photography,This book shows villeneuve to be the true racer he is both on an off the track...and shows wonderful insight into his life and stunning photography...which makes this book a perfect buy for the villeneuve fan.Long live Jacques..king of motorsport!!!!
4,one of the best racing biographies I have ever read,The best book I have read in a lonnng time. The book offers an excellent look inside the life of one of racings most fascinating personalities. Buy this book today.
4,A must for any villian based campaign.,"This book was excellent in what I found. It gave me all the information on several of the major villians found in the Forgotten Realms books. This book how ever is really not required for any good campaign, I liked it though because I could learn the stats of all my favorite villians, such as Jarlaxle, Artemis, Fzoul, and Manshoon. That is why I liked this book."
2,Good but......,This is a eoverall good book but at the speed that the FR world is update with the deaths of Villians and the rise in power of villians this book is out of date really fast. There are quite a few major villians that are listed in this book that are now dead but the book talks about them like they are alive. Agaisn good book but needs to be updated or something
2,As I have thought........,"As I have thought, the Bad Guys of the FR settings are either Wizard's or Undead (Lich's. for example) or simply dead (mostly killed by their o so good counterparts). About three quarters of this book is about villains long dead. Well, I don't count myself amoung those who support evildoers, but I would prefer more of a status quo among the FR heroes and villains. This book only told me for sure, what I expected for long. So long ........."
4,"If you like it heavy and quirky, this is for you!","Scissorfight, a band out of Massachusetts, is a very unique quartet to say the least. While their sound may remind you of some Alice In Chains, they more than make up for with the vocals. Lead singer Ironlung sings with conviction and like he doesn't care what you think, which is very refreshing. I love the whole album, but some highlights are Acid For Blood, Blizzards Buzzards Bastards, and N.H.'s All RIght If You Like Fighting. If you haven't heard anything else from them before, this is a good place to start, much like I did."
2,Not An Easy Read,"Although I did manage to read it all the way through, it was not as easy to follow as ""The Visionary"". There is alot of jumping from one place/event to another, and it is sort of hard to keep up with the charaters. All in all, it was interesting, just not what I usually like to read."
4,I kept coming back to it . . .,"I found myself reading a few chapters, and then putting it down so I could get back to work. Soon, I was finding an excuse to put off my work so I could pick it up to read a couple of more chapters. It's certainly not the greatest thriller in the world but yet it is addictive. The characters are mildly interesting, the plot is developed well, and it's fascinating to see how the plot moves the characters along to a conclusion. I haven't read Passman's other book but I plan to do so based upon this read."
4,Best FRS/GMRS radio for the money,"Extremely clear receiption. Midland say that the packaging is incorrect, the radio transmitts only 2 watts. Highly Recommended."
2,You dont get what you are paying for,"I recently ordered a pair of the Midland G30's. The review of these radios said that were STURDIDLY CONSTRUCTED and water resistant. This is a gross exageration. In fact the outer plastic shell looks like it would crack if you thumped it. There is not one sign of waterproofing. I have not actually tried the radios out to see what kind of range they have, I have been to disgusted with there overall CHEAPNESS in appearance. I think I will just send them back."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the G-30 hoping for increased range over FRS radios. Unfortunately, I found little if any difference. In fact, FRS radios (Motorola FR60) actually performed better from a range standpoint on some occasions. I even went to the trouble to send the units to Midland to have them checked. They did so and reported that they were ok.I can see only two reasons to purchase The G-30; advertised increased range, and gmrs channel capability. With range being most important on my list, I felt they were not worth keeping.By the way, I recently used the Motorola FR60's on a trip into the Grand Canyon. They provided line of sight communication at a distance of over 15 miles!"
1,Poor Range,"I bought this radio because I wanted the 5 mile range. Although it said UP TO 5 miles, I lost reception at 1/2 mile. The battery also did not hold the 8 hour charge as stated. I'm very disappointed with this radio system. I would look for another FRS radio."
3,Pre-Review before purchase?,I own x4 FRS Audiovox radios and plan to upgrade to the Midland GMRS G-30. I've read all the current reviews and noticed that some people do not understand FRS/GMRS. FRS radios max legal output power is 500mw. GMRS max legal is 2watt and maybe more on future models. The G-30 was designed to also communicate with FRS cousins. Do not expect 2watt power when communicating with FRS it's not gonna happen. Only the GMRS frequency band will allow the 2watt power output. Two GMRS radios set at GMRS frequencies required for 2watt power output. 5 mile range is more than likely in an open plane with no obstacles in sight. When I purchase the G-30's i'll do another rating. (...) I rated a 3star because I don't own one yet and my knowledge and reading the reviews was helpful.
1,Don't Buy This!,"This quality of this product is NOT good. The trimmer attachments are very weak and are easy to break, even if you are being careful.I suggest that if you are looking for a good trimmer, buy a different one."
1,maybe worth 2$,"This thing is just so crappy. I bought it mainly for some nose and maybe some body grooming. Well it takes about 5 minutes to trim your nose hair and the results just aren't very good. It can be done quicker and better with a pair of scissors (the only thing is the risk of a cut up there, yuck). As for body hair it works okay but don't even think about trimming your beard cause it does a horrible job and takes a long time.And to top it all off it is really loud."
4,An Australian Gem,"No reviews yet, I can't believe it. Buy this book for it's great introduction to Autralian life in 1800s as seen by a young woman trying to achieve what she wants in life.Young Sybilla finds herself stuck in the arid Australian Outback, talking to the pigs for intelligent conversation, in the absence of her father. From these lowly beginnings, her ambition for her 'Brilliant Career' takes her along a melodramatic path of humour and tragedy.For all the young women of today who don't think feminism is relevant, read this and see how much you take for granted.Also read 'My Brillian Career Goes Bung', for the real life story of the author, which is every bit as strange and fascinating as the fictional character in this book."
3,Nasturtium Seeds,I was pleased to be able to get nasturtium seeds on line.There was no description of the height of the plants in theon-line ordering site. The plants turned out to be rathergangly . . . I would have preferred a shorter stem variety.
3,not sure about this yet,Only 6 seeds from the 36 in the packet germinated...it has to be my fault.When these 6 bloom I'll decide if I'll ever plant this vine again.
1,Had to throw it away,"This was hands down the worst consumer electronics product that I've ever owned. The menu system is unintuitive, and I could never imagine myself ever being able to fully use the unit without the manual nearby. The unit appeared cheaply made and after about 6 months, the unit wouldn't even power up. I ended up just throwing it away. Pick another product in this category!"
3,remote access exam,about all the information of hardware and networking solutions.i should buy the book and read it my self.because my knowledge is not happyful.ok.it is my first time that i join the computer hardware and networking guidence.
2,Not enough information given,"The writing and explanations are not bad. It has better flow than Catherine Pauet's ""Building Cisco Remote Access Netowrks"". However it has less information. Most importantly you will not be able to truly understand the material, much less apply it. In order to be able to do the job, read Bill Burton's ""Remote Access for Cisco Networks"". Bill Burton's book is excellent, very clear and coherent.One more tip, all remote access books I looked at miss one important piece - they do not explain the complete set of interrelationships between serial interfaces, asynchronous interfaces, lines, controllers, vtys, ttys, etc. Therefore you need to read introduction section from ""Cisco IOS 12.0 Dial Solutions"". It is a horrible read and you will have to fight through it. Read it five times, if you have to. But, it will give you the mental map and the foundation needed to understand any book on this topic."
5,"It does what it says it will do, and more!","After gingerly slicing bagels for years, hoping not to injure myself, I finally broke down and got this Larien Babel Biter. Lo and behold, it works beautifully and consistently. But don't stop at just bagels! It perfectly slices english muffins as well. A word of advice: in some cases, the bagel needs a little nudge, once it rests in its designated spot, to be centered a bit so that when the blade descends, it will cut it more closely in half."
5,LOVE THIS!!!!,"My students run a ""bagel bar"" at school each week & I didn't want to have to worry about them slicing their hands. This worked great! We've been using it for a few years now & I love it!!! Works very well, some bagels you have to flatten a little to get them in there, but thats only if its a really big bagel. If you slice bagels a lot, you need this!!!"
4,Works Great - even with Costco bagels!,"Unlike one of the other reviewers, I find this slicer works fine with Costco bagels. Overall, we really like this slicer, especially since it allows our kids to slice and toast their own bagels!! The only downside is that if you try to slice a very soft bagel (either a soft fresh bagel, or one that you defrosted in the microwave a little too long) it will tend to smash it a little, rather than slice it. This is only because there is no sawing action, like you would have with a knife, just downward cutting force. This would obviously be a limitation of any of these types of products."
3,Not good for bigger bagles,We get our bagles from Costco. They are slightly larger than regular bagles in grocery stores. Got one of these (from another store) to slice Costco bagles. The fit was tight and didn't slice the bagle all the way through. Also squished the bagle a bit. But the construction is solid and will probably work well with smaller and harder bagles.
3,Fine machine --- but ----,"This bagel cutter is everything the manufacturer claims it is but, in my case its of no use!! I buy my bagels from Costco and they are a good bargain; fresh, tasty and uncut. But, when trying to put them in the slicer they are too fat and wont go in without jamming! So I have two fine products that are incompatible. I investigated further and now know that I should have bought the commercial slicer."
2,Must have dishwasher....,"I really liked this bagel cutter. My husband claims they ""moosh"" the bagels more than cut them, but he does not heat his to a crisp crust (so keep that in mind if you like a soft crust). My complaint about this is that it is virtually impossible to clean if you do not have a dishwasher. I have tried every sponge and scrubber out there and nothing works. If it is flat and narrow enough to fit between the blade and the clear plastic around it, the blade catches it and stops it from moving. It literally cannot be hand-washed to any acceptable cleanliness (and we aren't that picky....). Fantastic item if you have a dishwasher to put the whole thing in every time you use it. Unless you have soft bagels."
5,bagel biter,Excellent product! Easy to use and clean.. saves trips to the emergency room for sliced palms!
3,Not sharp enough,"This item works great if the bagels in question are somewhat stale. If they are fresh, it just isn't sharp enough and it crushes them rather than slicing them. That is why I only gave it 3 starts. I speculate that it is dull for fear of being sued by idiots who slice themselves."
4,Cuts smoothly but the bagels always get cut on an angle,"I purchased this after seeing a similar product at a motel. Up till then I had been using a plastic box with guides for the knife blade which worked okay but many of the bagels I purchased were too fat for it.The Larien bagel biter certainly cuts bagels fast and cleanly but no matter how I place the bagel in the channel, nor what brand I use, the bagels always come out cut on an angle with each half having one edge much thinner than the other. I can't believe it's a defective unit since there isn't much to go wrong so it must be the way I am positioning the bagel. Apart from that it works well and it is kid safe."
5,The calenadar is great but....,"I started using this calendar last year as a supplement to my Spanish classes and decided that I wanted to have one again for 2007. I couldn't find it in my local bookstores so I went on Amazon and ordered it.The calendar is great, I like studying all the phrases and have been able to use them in my own communications in Spanish. My only negative issue is with the packaging of the calendar. When I opened the box and unwrapped the calendar, the back of the calendar came off the desktop stand. It came unglued or something but I had to wrap tape around it to keep the calendar together. Maybe the manufacturer could come up with a better means of attaching the calendar pages to the backing."
4,Communication Survival Kit for the 21st Century,"Every day one is greeted with a sentence in Spanish, complete with the pronunciation. There is a logical progression of the day to day offerings such as conversation about attending school, where, courses taken, attributes of teachers and the like. Or there may be a series about clothes, or shopping. Good fun and keeps one's Spanish sharp."
2,The Spanish is incorrect,"I have a BA in Spanish. Someone bought this for me as a fun gift, but as the year goes on I keep finding more and more grammatical mistakes in the calendar. For example for a few consecutive days, when talking about location, the calendar used ""ser"". Location should always be expressed in Spanish using the verb ""estar"". This is a good resource for vocabulary, but it contains multiple grammatical errors."
4,Works just fine for me,"I've owned this model for about 3 years - no problems! It's so good that I'm here on-line to get another one for my basement rec room. I know this 900 MHz is not as powerfull as some of the newer models, but for the price ($19.95), it's well worth it."
2,Mine died too,"It's interesting that my phone died too, after having it about 1 1/2 years or so. It just stopped working, so i bought a new battery, which didn't help. Clearly I'm not the only one with this problem. I guess it's time to throw it into the landfill with all the other junk America uses up....."
3,Good Phone for a Short Time,"I, too, was happy with the phone for about a year--then like the other reviewers--the phone just died. Unfortunately, I was not as smart as some of the others, I actually purchased a new battery--bad move! The phone is just as dead"
3,"Works well, but eventually breaks","I actually really enjoyed this phone...for the money, it seemed a decent spend. But just short of its two year birthday it suddenly died. Not a slow fading of the battery, but completely gone. I thought I might try a new battery, except I can get a new phone for just a few bucks more."
1,Phone only lasts for a year..,"Im a bit upset for buying this ... phone! No wonder its only a 1 year warranty..b/c after one year, you can't use the damn phone no more .......The phones just dies!..Don't even bother to buy a new one..it will still die out after 4 mins talking on the phone.Its not the battery, its the phone!!"
5,kingpin474,im a young but well rounded gamer but if u play shooting games these are the headsets for u i use to use turtle beach x4 but it made my ear ich go tritton all the way they have true dolby 5.1 surrond sound which is ahuge at vantage during game play they are more realible then turtle beach and if u play halo or call of duty send me a friend request so we can play together xbox 360 gamer tag:kingpin474
2,"Works great, Pepsgruver.","Well.. totally fell apart on me after a year. Atleast I got a year. I miss having surround sound in games though... that part was awesomeAwesome, no problems at all. Nice to finally be able to use the surround sound and optical out. This really helps when I play halo, picking up vehicular noise from different directions is a snap. Would definitly buy this agani."
4,Great Cones!!,"love this, I would say the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is all the cables, if it was wireless and had the same sound it would be perfect."
3,"Great headset, but horrible for XBox 360","I recently purchased this headset to use with my XBox 360, and first I want to say its probably the best headset I've ever used, but it is pointless if you have friends that you are intending on using this to communicate with them. It doesn't have any kind of booster setting for the mic volume so you can't hear anything from the mic when there is any action within the game."
3,Tritton AX360,The head set had great sound but after two weeks the wire which attaches to the headset broke from movement. It is way to thin a wire. I returned them and may get the more expensive unit after seeing the wires
4,Not good for computers,"I bought these headphones in order to get surround sound for my computer games. These things are GREAT as far as comfort and sound quality, and the included mic is also very nice. But for my computer games, the 5.1 surround would not work. I talked this over with tech support and apparently it works for playing DVD's, which I have tried and it DOES work for this, and sounds pretty good. But it is a big let down when I spend $100 only for the main attraction to not work in any game, even with all the tweaking I have tried. It is definitely more for the Xbox 360."
4,"Nice sound, a little flimsy","The sound effect you get is awesome. They can be used on any digital sound source. The vibration is cool. I use them online playing Halo 2 and I think it gives me a slight advantage. You can hear everything and determine it's direction. They came missing a part and customer support online did not return my email for a month. But I had already called customer support on the phone (it took 3 attempts) and they sent me the part. The headphones are not the stoutest thing out there, I really think the mic attachment is wimpy. They are very comfy and will get you into the game so I give em 4 stars."
1,No good for Live,"If you enjoy playing on xbox Live then these are pretty much worthless. Even when i turned all the in-game volumne almost all the way down, i could barely hear when people were talking. Very annoying. You would think that with five volume controls that they would have included one for voice, but they didn't. For me, total waste of money."
3,Poor Sound,The sound quality on these headphones are not as good as I had heard. There is not much base and there is some rattling noise.
3,Good headset..,"well i just got my headset yesterday and i have to say that i love this stuff it works realy good, , specialy if u play Call of duty 4 or halo or any other game online this product is great."
3,Dead in less then 2 years,"these was the best headset I have ever had, until today when one speaker just stopped. they only have a 1 year warranty so there is nothing I can do. there is no obvious disconnected wires, everything looks to be in perfect shape and yet one side does not work.very disappointed, I knew it only had a 1 year warranty most do, but i expected them to last a lot longer for over 100$. not sure what to do about a replacement now..."
1,NO BASS!,"I picked these up after reading all the rave reviews and I'm completely disappointed. The surround sound works but the bass is terrible. I compared them to my old 50 dollar sony headphones and while they don't have surround sound I prefer them for my gaming. The guns and grenades in any shooting game sound pretty bad compared to my cheaper headphones, it's a shame because if these headphones had even decent bass they would be incredible...but they don't.If you have never played games using another set of headphones maybe you won't mind but I cannot recommend buying the AX360 5.1 as I completely regret my purchase, get something else."
3,Good Product. Excellent Quality.,"Only Good things, except I found the sound kind of flat. No Treble or Bass adjustment. In my opinion, sound is kind of lacking treble. Besides this its a great product. Comfortable too."
3,They are an ok set of headphones,"When I first received my headphones I first set everything up to the Xbox and it was good. The cord that plugs the mic into the controller is very cheap though. It would only work with one of my controllers. After I bought a new cord from monoprice.com it worked then. At the times when there was no sound coming out of them, I would hear little faint beeps. I don't know if that is because something is wrong with it but it was annoying. The rumble feature is also a little low. It would only work sometimes. I play Call of Duty 4 with these and I couldn't feel the explosions. Other than that it is a nice set but I need a better set to play with so I am returning them."
2,No depth in the ear pads,"The ear pads aren't deep enough to be beneficial so they end up pressing the ears causing discomfort and even some pain with extended use (10+ minutes), and my ears aren't that big. Anyhow, in the end I'm not getting to enjoy what might be a great audio experience.I don't understand why these engineers aren't able to create a comfortable set of headphones. So it looks like I'm sending these back and will continue my search."
1,What can I say?,"There is no bass and surround sound is pretty bad. How can you play video games in surround with no bass? There is a vibrating mechanism. Great, when I'm watching a movie explosions vibrate my ears. Not worth $100 at all.Don't waste your time, go with the Ear Force X4 - they're wireless :)"
2,Do not buy if you are an online gamer,"I had another review for this item that I did shortly after receiving the item which I deleted to post this one in its place. It's been a bit longer and I'm afraid I no longer stand by the first one. The wire is too short to be really practical, too annoying to be convenient, and the inability to control Xbox Live chat volume separately is a really big problem. I'm gonna return them."
4,Very Nice,I just purchased these a few weeks ago specifically for xbox live. When I got them it was a little difficult to set up because you aren't given too much information. I called Tritton's support and they helped me set the headset up in minutes. Since its the Holidays Season and I'm on break from school I've had a lot of time to use these.I would rate these 5 / 5 but the only problem that I've had is with the mic. The wire is very flimsy and after a few days of play it got a kink and now I'm not able to talk to people. But Tritton has a good warranty system and I'll be able to get a replacement mic at no cost to me.
3,Not Bad But Not Great,They are cool but need more work.The Bass is weak at best. The surround also is ok at best. I use them with my xbox360 and it does help. But the volume control is lame and the overall quality is ok. The sound is good but needs better lowend. Also i wish i could hear the mic in the head phones to know how loud i am for other players.Good for surround gaming headphones but still not great yet.
2,Not Great For XBox Live or Having a Microphone,"Sound is pretty good, but it's hard to hear other players on XBox Live. You have to crank up the center speaker to hear them, which makes the whole game LOUD. Also, crappy microphone will break on you and cost you another $22."
5,HUGE sound quality upgrade from turtle beach,"I've previously owned the Turtle Beach x3's, then more recently the X3.1's and I have heard good things about tritton so I decided to give these a try since the price was right. First and foremost the sound quality is outstanding compared to my turtle beach headsets, I realize I am losing the convenience of wireless but to me it's worth the better sound and comfort. I love the individual dials to control sound volume for front, center, rear and bass channels. The included mixer unit is also nice because of it's ability to decode the dolby surround sound from my xbox via optical cable and distribute that so I can use 5.1 computer speakers when not using the headset.All in all, very good bang for the buck here, I am officially a converted Tritton fan now."
2,Only heaset for Xbox,If you want to use this item for PS3 it will only work as headphones with no headset. The headphones sound great but no online chat avaible.
3,Great Headphones But I Can't Find Any Replacement Headphones That Work With AX360,"These headphones worked well. I didn't necessarily notice any great surround sound, but the headphones sounded full and crisp in comparison to my expensive stereo headphones.The bass/sub woofer is strange. I can't accurately describe it, it's not real bass.I cannot find any headphones that work with the AX360's output (besides the headphones that came with the package). So I can't replace the headphones or get a second set of headphones because I can't find compatible headphones/headset.It seems like I have to buy the entire AX360 package just to get another set of headphones.The Analog Output is Poor Quality so you can't use normal 5.1 analog headphones. You must use their strange custom output which they don't have any label or name for the output."
4,Great sound...but...,These have EXCELLENT sound but are heavy and can get warm on your ears. Also there is no voice playback so you can't hear yourself when you talk. I thought that wouldn't matter when I bought them but it really does kinda suck. I find myself not using them when I'm talking to friends online- in game.
5,Great,"As good as it gets! Worth every penny. Great sound, Great bass, Great everything!! I ordered another set for a backup on XBOX Live! I have a friend that has a set that had a wire get cut. It was his fault, but Tritton sent him a replacement overnight for no charge. Great Customer service."
5,Underappreciated,"Are you tired of lifeless unimaginative ""Jazz"" recordings, then buy this CD. Will Boulware is and has been great keyboardist for sometime. Since the late '70's he's recorded some great yet relatively underheard music. Keeping company with the likes of Michael Brecker and Maceo Parker, Boulware has developed into major player and band leader. The music here is a nice cross- section of jazz and for a lack of a better term, fusion. What can go wrong with Brecker(sax), Steve Gadd(dr), Anthony Jackson(bs), and Peter Bernstein(gtr)- answer little or nothin'!! Add Phoebe Snow's voice to a few of the tunes and the magic ensues. The compositions original or standard are real tunes with real arrangements and the playing (and singing) are superb. What are ya waitin' for BUY this CD!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Red Dress,"Nice tale of two sisters. Certainly not as good as the earlier novel, 'What Looks Like Crazy On An Ordinary Day."" It is a good story of family, love and believing in yourself. Since I'm from Michigan it is especially nice to read about a place so close to home. Idewild has long been viewed as a very romantic little place where black socialites gathered. After reading this book. I can hardly wait to go see for my self."
2,what a let down,I was very disappointed in this follow up novel for the reason listed below.1. the charators were one dimensial. Not developed at all. I found myself more interested in Lattimore Family than main charator.2. The main charactor Joyce was so contrived. Eveything just fell into place.3 Nate the only good male in the book beside Preachers husband was so peprfect. I never felt like he and Joyce never had a relationship.4. Girls in Sewing Circle were/couldhave made more intersting by a little more charator development.Sum it all up I felt like this book was written quickly to satisfy a deadline. I didnt feel Pearl Cleage put her heart and soul into this book. I am glad i got book on sale and didnt pay full price.
3,I agree... No where near....,"I agree with one of the other reader's comments. "" I Wish I Had a Red Dress"" was no where near as great( of a read ) as What Looks Like Crazy....... . Pearl did an outstanding job with Ava and Eddie's story. I'd expected the same .I was hoping I Wish .... the sequel would be just as great. It briefly touched on Ava , Eddie and the baby.While this story was to be about Joyce and getting on with her life. It left me feeling her relationship with Nate was not at all what I had expected.After reading the story I thought it would have been a much better idea for this book to be in tradesize ( book) compared to the price of hardcover books.I also hope other readers do not come away feeling like I wish I had ......, or not .... a Red Dress so soon after reading it."
2,Manifesto,"How are we supposed to believe the character of Joyce was an English teacher when her grammar is so awful? I am glad to see that feminism is alive and well in African American literature, but I felt conned when I finished reading the novel, ... and too much like a manifesto for my liking."
4,Pretty Good Book,"I really enjoyed this book, I read it in one sitting. I believe it to be even better than What Seems Ordinary. Enjoyable, witty and very entertaining."
4,Loved It!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Ms. Cleage is a great storyteller and creates characters, settings and storylines that keep you riveted. I started reading this book yesterday while getting my hair done and got up early this morning so that I could finish it. Now, I love to read and it usually takes me a couple of days to get through the best of books - but I could not wait to see what would happen in this one! And I was not disappointed. If you like a good story (and a good love story to boot), don't miss this book."
4,Great,"I read this book in one day. The first book i read was ""what looks like crazy..."" and i was glad to see an added addition to that. I thought this book was great, i liked how she went into more detail about the Circus, and all of their problems, and it was great for her to finally meet someone because it was really time for her to move on from her husband's death. Cant wait to read the next one."
1,Boring from start to finish,Not the author's best work. The main character is too lame in her personal life. Her sister Ava was truly missed in this book and she had more to offer in her 1st book. I will not recommend this book.
4,I Wish I Had a Red Dress,I enjoyed the book. She kept my interest as she has done with her other books. I will buy more of her books.
2,ANNOYED,"I am in the process of finishing I Wish I had a Red Dress, and I have to say that I am quite annoyed by the the author's need to keep repeating certain things oooverrr and oooverrr, like how big Nate is, T's hair and things of that nature.The book so far is ok. I probably should read the hardcopy because the narrator of the audiobook ruins the experience for me.I AM TRYING SO HARD TO GIVE THIS BOOK A CHANCE, BUT BETWEEN THE NARRATOR'S HORRIBLE READING OF THE STORY AND HEARING HOW BIG NATE IS (A ZILLION TIMES) I JUST DON'T KNOW...* advice to authors ~ a bad narrator can make or break an audiobook!!!!I finished the book and it passes the time. I am willing to try some of the author's other material, but this book(in my opinion) was not a good read. I just pushed through because I felt I should finish it before I gave a rating for it..."
4,I Wish I Had a Red Dress,"I really enjoyed this book, it was thought provoking and stirred up a desire or need to do something more to contribute to the well being and encouragement of younger people, especially teens and tweens. I had previously read 'What Crazy Looks Like on an Ordinary Day' by Ms. Cleage and this was like a continuation/sequel to it. Really Good!"
2,Not her best work clearly.,Very disappointed in this work by such a talented author. This was one of my book club selections and it was unanimous---not a good pick :-(
4,Master storyteller,"I first read ""What Looks Like Crazy..."" last year and have recently read ""The Brass Bed.."" and I find that Pearl Cleage is a master storyteller. She blends her creative talent with the African oral tradition. I appreciate the honesty and creativity in her work. The voices and images are almost tangible. I can't wait to get my hands on ""Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do"".Take some time and enjoy Cleage's brand of reality."
4,Beautiful and Uplifting,"I thought this book was wonderfully inspirational. It follows the story of Joyce who has had far too much tragedy in her life. Another author writing this story might have made it trite or cliched, but the approach is fresh and interesting. By using clever dialogue, we receive many insights into Joyce's life, and why she behaves the way she does. Her character is strong yet vulnerable, and it is nice to see a character that is like a real person, and not a steroetype. Joyce grows not in leaps and bounds, but in baby steps, and it was very beleivalbe to me. Too many times I have seen characters make huge transformations apparently overnight, and it gets tiring!I enjoyed reading this novel- strong female characters, interesting storyline- all the things I want in a book."
2,Title is a misnomer. Spoonfeeder.,"The title of this book makes you think you're about to read about a character that is attempting to feel a little more free - maybe adding some spice to the love life and other spicier thing - but that's really not the case. The character instead spends a lot of time trying to help troubled women in her community, which is quite noble - just not something somebody necessarily does with a red dress on.The reason the story must go this way is so that Ms. Cleage can take the time to spoonfeed the reader on how they should feel about the city of Idlewild, black culture, and black women. Some of the very uncreative dialogue among the characters is so overopinionated and irrelavant that I think even Ms. Cleage might have forgotten at times what her book is supposed to be about. The love exchange that happens (but never really goes far enough) is the highlight for me.I must also add that the rushed ending also does the book little justice."
4,A Reader reviews Red Dress...,"While the author states this is not a sequel to ""What Looks Like Crazy on An Ordinary Day"", she returns us to Idlewild Michigan and a familiar main character named Joyce. The story is one that many women face; that inability to let go of past hurt and open themselves up to be free. The characters are all very colorful and well-described. However, the town minister kind of throws the reader for a loop, completely contradicting what one would imagine a 'Southern Baptist Minister' to be. This minister takes some of the credibility away from an otherwise believable story, by HER radical New South approach to ministering to her congregation. All in all the book is a very good read and certain to lead to great book discussions. A definite RECOMMEND."
4,Excellent Discussion Book!,"Though I didn't enjoy RED DRESS as much as WHAT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY, this book addresses many important gender issues in a way that I have never seen before. I appreciated that. I love the way that Cleage included women of different generations and how they each learned from the other. I do wish that some of the discussions had been more lengthy though.Joyce was so smart in her dealings with the people in her life. I'm glad to see a woman in fiction standing her ground, not chucking everything important to her just to satisfy a five year itch. This is an important book for us as woman and for the men in our lives especially.C.M. MILLER, Author---Accrual Way To Die, An Audrey Wilson Mystery"
4,I Wish I had A Red Dress,"Great Book. I enjoyed the book because there were so many instances where I thought about myself and how I compared. Example, was I able to do all the items listed to be an independent women.Joyce showed me another way of thinking about young women who have made bad choices in life.I saw Joyce as being a very together women. She was secure in herself. Confident, yet open for love and a good relationship. It was refreshing to me to know that there are women out there who have only been with one man in their life.After Terry McMillan's first, I began thinking I was a bit strange.There were so many lessons to be learned from this novel about life and relationships.I particularly enjoyed the way Joyce taught the young ladies to think critically and make their own decisions.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to women of all ages."
2,i wish i had a better book,"After reading Pearl Cledge's first book I was very excited when I received her second book. I couldn't figure out what was missing, it was taking me so long to finish the book. One day I left it at home, and I realized I just didn't care about the characters. The main character was unrealistic, and the romance never took off. I was intrested in some of the minor characters, but unfortunatuly, they weren't the focus of the book."
3,I wish too...,"I wish we could all get along... be respected, live peaceably, and love freely.On our second trip to the small town of Idlewild, Joyce brings along amusing friends, neighbors and freedwomen who spice up the pages of this sequel. When the community comes together to offer support, Joyce celebrates by wearing a red dress which enhances her fiery personality.""I Wish I Had a Red Dress"" is an amusing love story because it reverberates the essence of love for self, family, friends, community, and a tall, dark, secure, handsome man!"
2,Missing Imani,"The Joyce we met in ""What Seems Like Crazy..."" would never have told the whole story without mentioning Imani and explaining what's happened to her. Who is this person? No word on her sister either. Looks like Ms. Cleage just wanted to sell one more book based on the first one. Very disappointing."
1,Library time,"Borrow it from the library, do not purchase. Not this author's best effort. The main character is a tinderbox of anger and is perpetually indignant and argumentative. Tiresome."
4,Good read,"The main heroine of the book is Joyce, she is likeable and realistic. I haven't read the previous book about the main character's sister, so I came in with the expectations of reading a light hearted book about women and possibly fashion judging from the title, instead I got a book with highs and lows and discussing conepts such as gangs, drugs, domestic violence, loss, fear, respect, and raising oneself and others out of hopelessness. It was a very enjoyable read. Another plus is the chapters are quite short making this a book that is easy to pick up/put down (though at times the putting down is difficult)."
4,I Wish I had a Red Dress,"This book was very well written. She does an excellent job at keeping your attention. Sometimes, Joyce was a bit too much it seems that the other characters seemed to balance it out. This makes a great bookclub book it's easy to discuss and read. Great Job."
5,"awesome cd,","In general, I liked this cd, it's very rocker.But, I don't like ""de verdad"" song, the song is boring( and won the grammy for best song? ). In contrast, I love ""diablo"",""soy tu lluvia"" and ""abrazame"", good for Alejandra..Everybody must have it."
3,La Guzmán eres...,"First off, its her first cd in about 2 years. And the minute you get it back on, A RUSH from title ""Diablo"". Oh Yeah!! Then you're hit with ""Dime de verdad"" amd you're hit with a much deserved ""radio hit"" for her in a long while. Yeah! But as you go in to the cd you get into more of a creative look into ""rock en español"". ""Volvere Amar"" the tearjerker of the cd is very good, finishing off with the last 2 tracks are very much her style...in a way. Its a good start for the new millenium..."
1,Backyard facory farming...YIKES!!,"I expected a book of endearing stories about having a damily cow but what I got was a mini manual on factory farming techniques. As a vega, I found it distastful and misleading."
4,"Everything you wanted to know about Bossy, but didn't ask.","This is a wonderfully entertaining book. It is full of essential knowledge, as well as humor. I'm the son of a dairy farmer who is the son of a dairy farmer. I will be the first person to admit that I learned a lot from this book. The subject depth that the author goes into in each chapter is great. Everything is explained in simple terms yet gets very detailed. I would compare his ability to keep a complex subject simple to the writings of Isaac Asimov. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a serious interest in small scale farming, the family farm, or simply wants to know all the essentials about cattle."
2,Beware Collectors!,Amazon puts irremovable stickers on the back of their book covers. Stickers have been invented that can be easily peeled off leaving no residue. I don't consider a book as new and collectible that has an Amazon sticker on it.
2,Based on Looks,"I ordered this book as a gift. They had requested it so I feel certain that the content was what they wanted and I cannot rate it. My rating is based on the appearance of the book. The cover did not look brand new. It looked as if it had been in the sun somewhere or something. The pages themselves were better, but I was disappointed."
5,Good service,Item received quickly and was exactly what I ordered. No problems. Would recommend and do repeat business.
1,Pile of JUNK!,Same experience as everyone else. It worked for a while and then one day no flashing light and a faint ticking sound. I may try to open it and attempt to get the drive going but from what I'm reading that will most likely be 2 hours of my life I will never get back.Next time I buy Seagate.
1,Poor Enclosure,"Bought this 500GB drive back in 2005-06. It failed after about 2 years using it sparingly. Problems started when it sometimes would not mount in Windows & would get the red light of doom. Was able to remove the Western Digital SATA hard drive & place it in a USB SATA external enclosure but lost all data. Was able to reformat & the drive is working fine, so the problem must have been the Acomdata enclosure interface board. Bad experience has made me avoid any Acomdata products. I do have a 80GB external Accomdata USB 2.0/firewire drive from about 2004 still plugging along fine, so this particular model must have been bad."
1,Very Poor Reliability,"I purchased this product many months ago to store my backups. After only four backups to this device, it failed to initialize. Tried it on several PC's, but NO LUCK. All the data was lost, but I took the case apart and salvaged the Western Digital 320 GB IDE hard drive inside. Installed it into my PC, formatted the disk, and now I have another hard drive. This proves to me that Acomdata designed a worthless USB-to-IDE interface card."
1,Dont Buy This!!! Acomdata's Die easily!~ say goodbye to your data,"Not one but 2 of them died, i have 3... so that means my 3rd is due for a death... what a waste of $$$... i have 2 other externals a mybook that ive purchased around the same time, still alive and well.. im never purchasing another acomdata hdd ever again, and i suggest everyone start backing up their data on to reliable hdd's, cuz i lost plenty.."
1,Stopped working after one month...,"The hard drive became unrecognizable by my laptop running XP. Downloaded the latest drivers and nothing worked. Acomdata's tech support is deplorable. Horrible response. When I finally got a support rep to email me back, he literally wrote: ""It sounds like you have a hard drive failure and although you've only owned it for a month, I'm afraid we can't replace it and you're just out of luck. Sorry.""There's too many other good external hard drive options out there to waste your time with a disorganized company like Acomdata..."
1,Very unreliable,"Bought this drive to store music for my iPod and for data backups. VERY unreliable. Frequent write failures, drive keeps disconnecting itself which causes the device to become ""dirty"" and it needs to be error checked. Last error check took over 8 hours due to frequent disconnects which meant I had to keep starting the process over. I haven't used the software since the day I installed it. Software autostarts when drive is powered on and sometimes hangs up which causes the drive to, you guessed it, hang up. The only way to break the hang-up is to power off and on the drive, which causes it to become dirty and starts the error checking again. Totally useless for backups since it is so unreliable."
1,Failue,"Had less than a year and it just died. Also, not happy with interface with Mac OS.Will never buy another product from Acomdata!!!!Shame there are no ""0"" stars."
1,Mine crashed and no replacement,Mine crashed only after a year. NO OPTION FOR REPLACEMENT! and I lost all my data. I should last longer than one year!
1,500 Gig piece of junk!,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CHEAP - you get what you pay for!I bought this device and put my music and photos on there and then a month and a half later the drive failed. I sent it in for warranty service and they said that power wasn't getting to the drive but they couldn't do anything because they don't make the dive. SO Acomadta was just going to send back another piece of junk and not fix the one with the info.
1,Please let me give it 0 stars.,"I bought this because the box specifically stated that it was Windows Vista compatible. WRONG. It will not mount on my Vista Home Premium machine, but works fine with the Windows 2000 computer I use at work. Since it is the home computer I need the drive to work with, the drive is useless to me. Naturally Acomdata's tech support has never seen this problem. Their solution was to tell me that since it works on a W2k machine it has to be a problem with my Vista computer. Unless you are interested in purchasing in a 500GB paperweight, stay away from this."
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this cheap junk...","Bought this external Acomdata 500GB hard drive recently. Windows starts giving me ""delayed write failure"" errors - not even the 2nd day I owned it. So I Google, find out that one cause of this is bad or loose cabling. I check the drive, and sure enough there is a ton of play on the cable - its loose enough that it can probably move on its own just from vibrations on my desk. I try another cable I had from another drive, and its loose too. The USB connector on the drive is not tight enough. Where is the quality control here? Am going to return it ASAP."
1,"DANGER, WILL ROBINSON! DON'T BUY ACOMDATA!","I bought the little brother of this one, the HD250UHE5-72. It died in under nine months... Its demise began with a steady ""click click click"" as the head kept parking itself. About a month later, I was able to cajole it into working one more time and removed my data before the motor quit. This has a Samsung PATA drive at its heart. I would never buy anything from Acomdata again."
1,Learn from my mistake,"I had (yes, had) everything on this drive. Today it died. Apparently, this is quite common. The loss is so drastic, I can't even put my mind around it. You get what you pay for..."
2,Nautica Port Elizabeth comforter & Shams,"While I received the comforter with in one week, four weeks and counting I am still waiting for the pillow shams. This is unacceptable to me."
5,Good honest seller...,"I had never received this book and they refunded my money asap...no question!!! Thank you being so honest!! Hopefully we do business again sometime.Thank you,Renee"
2,has the name but not the quality,"i purchased this system back in december and to say the least it was a major dissapointment. i have sony speakers, a sony ps3, a sony ps2 , and a sony dvd player. i figured that they would all be compatible. boy, was i wrong!! not only that, but the sound was only marginal. i figured that this would be a good fit in medium sized living room, but the sound was low and at times not very clear. in addition to that, i hooked up an ipod dock, that was not sony, and it would not work. i tried using av cables and it still wasn't working properly. the hdmi outputs are nice, but i seem to get better audio thru a direct connection from my dish receiver than thru this receiver. i will say that the picture quality was great, but without the sound, it's like having $2000 tires on a ford pinto.i ended up buying the onkyo tx-sr505 and can say it has much better sound qaulity and compatability than i expected. and it costs less than this ""sony"", made in china receiver!!"
3,"Nice receiver, but definitely not top-of-the-line. Good buy.","Good 6.1 receiver. There are better models available, but the price is cheap for this nice Sony model."
4,Great upgrade to my aging Sony receiver,"For the sake of brevity I will just say that this receiver works great, and with the price that I paid on Amazon completely worth every penny. The only problem I'm having and this could be operator error, is that I find that I have to turn the volume up to mid 20's and 30's especially when watching DVD's for it to be loud enough to hear completely(especially center/voices). I am using a mix of quality Kenwood towers/subs and Sony Surround, and know the speaker are correct ohm and power ratings...I personally prefer Sony receivers and will still choose them years from now when its time to upgrade again."
4,great receiver for the $$,"this receiver was exactly what i needed. with 3 HDMI ports and easy interface it allowed me to connect all of my devices (PS3, AppleTV, TivoHD) seamlessly. i didn't need an OSD and the PS3 does the DVD upconverting for me so the 910 was just too much $$ for not enough extra features.i would recommend this receiver to anyone putting together a home entertainment system."
5,awesome deal,"3 hdmi in and one out for 300 bucks? couldn't find that anywhere else!for my setup that is all the matters although the unit works well in all other areas too, although i am only using HDMI ports."
5,Great price for 3 HDMI input,I was looking for a receiver that could take three HDMI inputs and pass audio and video through one HDMI output to the HDTV. This receiver is great. I paired it with some $299 JBL 5.1 speakers and I have an awesome sounding system.
4,Sony STR-DG810 6.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver,Easy to set up. My only disappointment was with the HDMI out. You can not use an HDMI to DVI conversion cable. You will lose all sound if you do. To take full advantage of the new unit I'll have to wait until I buy a new TV.
2,"Lots of exam questions, but how many of them are useful?","The theory behind a lot of the practice exam questions are absent from the book. The 'claimed' layout of the exam is incorrect. The questions on addressing are based on old RFC's and most of the questions are quite different to the ones I sat for in the real exam (but maybe thats just my luck). Maybe the exam format has changed since the introduction of the book? who knows! Well as for me, I get to look forward to purchasing another book and sitting the exam again:("
1,not what i hoped it would be,"ok. maybe my hopes were a little high for this product to work. but, it ain't great.first, let me start off by saying it does not fit C's or D's. i tried to cram my C sized bra inside but unless i wanted to bend the underwire, the thing just wasn't going to fit. maybe it will fit B's or A's,but i don't have any of those hanging around to try out.desperate for this product to work, i tried wrapping a bra around the outside of the largest of the two ...er... compartments and then securing a garment bag around that to keep the bra in place. that did NOT go well. the bra became unraveled and a mess by the time the spin cycle was through.i ended up using these items underneath my bras to support them while they are drying flat.it's a great idea, but it needs serious improvement."
1,favourite blasio,"Dear Blasio I love yr music bt I was realy disappointed lately there's too much singing combined I enjoy yr music not the singing even if you want to add singing let it be 1 or 2 songs at most in 1 CD please let us enjoy yr music. I buy yr CD to hear you personal, please com back to your style in Solo, Grande Exitos, Barrocco ... I realy miss you. I,m longing to hear&enjoy your lovely piano."
5,A Path Back to Trusting Our Bodies,"This book is a classic food book. It's first manifestation was way back in the 70s, a thin volume that nevertheless was packed with wisdom about how to get back in touch with our bodies and our nutritional needs. Nearly 30 years later its prescriptions, or perhaps I should say ""non-prescriptions,"" still hold as true as ever. The author tells us, in a warm but informative way, how to read our bodies inner messages about what we need to stay healthy. The key is eating from one bowl and paying attention in some very unusual ways--at least unusual in today's culture--to foods that ""hum,"" for example, and how we can make use of this information for making healthy choices. I think that one of the greatest contributions this book makes is that it teaches us how to make choices from the inside out--choices that bring us closer to our bodies and closer to ourselves."
2,"Eat when you're hungry, stop when you're not",Pretty basic diet advice wrapped up in 128 pages of spiratulaism and anecdotes. Great if you're into that kind of thing.
5,Interesting book,"One Bowl: A Guide to Eating for Body and Spirit is interesting and inspirational. In reality, it is very difficult to follow."
2,Danelectro Fab Metal pedal,"The overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic. The sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion. The pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and doesn't have a very good range (very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results). not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit. i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of, otherwise i would not have purchased the item."
1,Waste of Time,"I bought this low priced pedal mainly for my daughter as a starter. To my surpise, there was no power supply included! Not even a battery. No mention on Amazon's product description that a power supply for the unit was not included. I also bought the other two models... One of them picks up a radio station and broadcasts it thru the amp, yet, there isn't a radio station tower within 5 miles of my house. All in all, I feel I got ripped off. If I had known they did not come with power supplies, I would not have purchased them."
2,Too much gain...too little tone.,"I got this pedal for $10 used and tried it with a tube amp. The tone is good at the low end but diminishes after 1 or 2'oclock. There is a ton of gain with the pedal and turning the gain down and adjusting the tone to taste was the only way I didn't get total tone loss with a Telecaster and Les Paul. Turn the gain all the way up and low end diminishes. It sounded like a Line 6 modeling amp with the metal settings on high.This pedal is cheap and may work better on a solid state amp, I never tried it. Some of Danelectro's pedals are gimmicky. I own the distortion and the echo pedals which are good for what they are, but this one misses it's mark for me."
1,Was good at first,"Well I got this pedal because it was cheep and all the reviews were good so i thought hmmm. this could be good. but no I was wrong. it may have just been a mine but at first it was amazing, then after a few days it started to sound funny when i turned the tone past a fourth of the way up, kind of like electricity, that's the best i could describe it. but now it is always sounding like that. I would say don't get this product."
4,Very good relation price/quality,"This pedal offers a very dirty distortion, perfect to play thrash metal, but not heavy metal. I would not recomend this pedal for solo, cause high notes sound very nassal and very thin. However to play that chunky sound (i.e: metallica's kill'em all) is perfect. It has a lot of gain, but its not very vesatile, but for the price is the better out there. I have read some reviews about the low reliability, i had it like 2 months and work perfectly.Conclusion: Very cheap and i would recomend it for beginners whose amp doesn't have too much gain to play metal stuff."
3,its just ok nothing great,"Sounds were ok , easy to use. BUT I did notice a little back noise or hum when this device is connected to my amp. plugged my behringer back in and no back noise so I guess they use a little cheaper hardware... this noise is not noticeable when playing but sure is when guitar sits idle...."
3,so/so,"I was a little put off by the consistency of the product, It is very soupy/watery brown mixture. I am used to using lotions that are cream based. It also had an odor that would subside after 15-20 minutes."
1,Surprising disappointment,"This author (Madelon Bedell) seems to have an actual dislike for the Alcotts, which makes me wonder why she went through all the work of writing a biography of them.Just one example: her comment under the only known portrait of Elizabeth, the sister who died young, ('Beth' in Little Women) that she looked 'sly', is just a jaw-drop. This doesn't fit with any of the memories of Elizabeth Alcott, neither those of her sisters nor other contemporary accounts, as shown in Shealy's Alcott In Her Own Time.The sense I had after I got into this book a bit was that the author somehow had her own agenda....I would have given it no stars at all, but I didn't know if I could. A great disappointment; so much could have been done with this subject. I definetly can't recommend it."
5,Gorgeous Ride,"Length:: 7:28 MinsThis is an awesome ride that takes you from Colorado to New Mexico. The scenery is breathtaking and the ride itself is ablast. Its fast paced, as its a big group ride/race. Its full of energy and fun the entire time. Its so fun you forget your on a stationary bike pedaling away."
1,aroma adf-212 smart fry xl dig dual basket df,had this product for 6 month's and it quit working and the manifacture won't replace or even answer my email's amizon offerd 50% refund but it would cost more to return it think caushiously before buying or get the warrenty
3,great price,"Fryer has great price,but the time /temp adjustments ar a little confusing. It cooked fast,but with frozen chicken you need to be careful.As basket was lowered into hot oil,with the lid on of course,it erupted like a volcano and shot hot oil all over my kitchen.What a mess to clean.Luckily no one was hurt.I recommend thawing frozen meats before frying."
4,Great Fryer,"Aroma ADF-212 Smart Fry XL Digital Dual Basket Deep Fryerreceived it and used it for the 1 st. time on 05/29/09. cooked french frys and blue gill fish. it worked great. the controls are easy to use if you read the instructions. the oil came up to 375 degrees in 23 minutes from cold cooked the fish for 3 minutes in 2 batches their were 31 pieces they came out perfect then I cooked 2 lbs. of frozen fries and they came out perfect. I could only give it 4 stars because when I put the frozen fries in the temperature droped to 295 degrees and never got above 300 degrees by the time the fries were done, but they were not greasey. the fryer takes 5 qts. of oil. so I also ordered the stainless steel strainer with filter this worked perfect for straining the oil to save it and reuse. this replaced a 3 qt. T-Fal fryer I had. I fed 5 hungry people"
5,Great buy,"My wife loves to cook with this fryer. The size will accommidate nearly anything. However, plan to fill with 1-1/4 gallons of oil. Clean up is great. The heat heating element lifts out to allow easy cleaning. The hanging baskets allows the food to drain into the fryer to minimize mess."
3,no bad... but,The digital timer is a bit hard to use. You could accidently shut of the fryer if you don't press it right.The temperature drops every time i put food in and it takes a while to get the heat back up.The filter doesn't seem to work that well so I have to fry the food outside.Overall Not a bad fryer. Just takes a lot of oil.
5,Awesome Deep Fryer,"I have used many deep fryers in the past and also having worked at a Fried Chicken place, I was looking for something that would give me similar results and it did. The large basket is perfect for frying some chicken and or catfish filets. It does take about 15 minutes or so to warm up, but that was expected being as big as it is, it hold nearly a gallon and a half of oil. Would definitely recommend this fryer to anyone looking for one"
4,Great Fryer - Terrible Timer,"This is a great deep fryer for the countertop. Heats up well and holds temp good. Using the timer is - well difficult at best. We just stopped using it and instead use our polder digital timer. If they would have had seperate controls for the timer - this fryer would have been perfect.Baskets are great. Built in holders to let the grease drip off the food. All in all, we really like it - just fix the timer!!"
4,deep fryer. digital ok,had a delonghi for 10 years switch went bad. got this one and i am impressed that 4 minutes from frozen to edible French fries! however i lilke crucnhy and you need to play around with it off of the automatic settings from 00-10 as the heat does not work on the timer. manual settingsa are better for crispier. i would recommend but at least it really does get to 375 before doing anything else.
1,Aroma Not So Smart Deep Fryer,"Used it about 9 times top before it started giving me an Er on the display and a beep. It worked about 2 more times before it quit completely. Now it is a big door stop. Did more research on the web and see others have this same issue. Gave up and bought a Fry Daddy. Hope it works better. Aroma is junk! Buy anything else, or eat out. It's less expensive than throwing away your money on this one."
3,Hot to touch and loses heat,"As much as I would like to not have to pack it up an send it back, that is what I am going to do. After two attempts, same problem. Oil loses heat dramatically and takes a LONG time to recover. The sides of the unit also get hot, very hot. Like other reviewers said, but I apparently disregarded, the steam from the unit prevents you from adjusting the temperature without getting a steam burn. Two baskets side by side or the one larger does not hold much more than my old Euro-Pro one deeper basket. Pick another fryer."
2,Not so great - Not worth the price,"It is July 2010. We bought this fryer in 2009 and have to replace it already. It was used about once a month or more for deep frying wings, fish, chicken parts, etc. Unfortunately, the fryer started to overflow which we thought was our fault. Then we found the temperature was way off. Eventually, oil was able to get into the control housing and that is the end of that. It's dead. It's a disappointment in that we enjoyed the fryer in the beginning and it was an upgrade from a cheaper plastic-cased fryer. Funny, the cheaper fryer just finally was so gunked up from use, it was impossible to keep it looking remotely clean, but it never died like this one. We are not necessarily beginners for frying and maybe everything that went wrong is our fault, but we will not buy another one of these fryers."
1,didn't work second time we used it !,"Bought this on amazon....after reading all the great reviews...Cooked a batch of wings a week after purchase and it worked perfectly....went to use it a couple of months later and it worked long enough to cook the wings halfway and then kaput........nothing, won't heat, won't reset...Wrote to the company, who by the way no longer sells this item, ( I wonder if it's because of consumer complaints ? Manufacturers flaw ? )and received no response.Didn't return to amazon because the item was only eligible for half of a refund and the shipping would have caused it to be not worthwhile.thanks Aroma...I wasn't planning on having one batch of wings cost me over 90 dollars !@8&&)(*&)"
5,This is one great deep fryer,This is really a great deep fryer for home use. I like the temperture control and the resulting fried foods. Holds a good deal of oil and has a nice capacity for frying foods. Really a joy to use. I recommend and would buy again.
3,Works great if you cook everything on 375,"This is a great fryer as far as cooking goes. However, the timer and temperature settings are next to impossible to set. Maybe I just got a bad one, as others seem to not have any problems. Also, the controls are right over where the hot steam comes out if you have the lid on, so getting burned is easy to do. I wish I had bought one that had one simple dial to set temperature and a light to come on when that setting was reached. I don't mind using my watch to time."
4,Great fryer but be careful,"This is the large capacity fryer that we were looking for; you can actually lay a piece of haddock flat when making fish 'n chips!It takes a fair amount of time to reach the 370 degree setting for the chips, but the end result has been consistently good food, not dripping with grease. In short, an excellent large capacity fryer.Two points that stopped me giving it five stars: (i) the exterior surface of the product gets as hot as the oil so keep it out of harm's way and out of reach of kids and pets. (ii) the time and temp control is mounted at the back so if you make an adjustment when you're frying, your wrist gets scalded by the steam emitting from the filter - the design engineer clearly doesn't use the product!"
2,NO,Won't keep oil at a consistant temperature. Couldn't keep the oil hot enough to fry 2 pieces of chicken at a time.
3,large,this thing is really big - if your cooking for a big family cool - but for infrequent frying its a little much - uses lots and lots of oil - needs time between batches to reheat - but it does what it says for the most part
1,only for recreational use...,"if you plan on using this often, either strain the oil daily, which is ridiculous....or forget it....barely any residue in the bottom will cause the element to ""overheat"", and turn itself off.....unless i got a faulty unit, which perhaps i have, and should return it....it's basically junk.....i'm very disappointed."
5,Smart Fry,"Ive had two fryers before this one but never had one with a double basket and two smaller ones it is really great almost like having a little diner in you home. Makes plenty of fries, Works perfect. Tom"
4,deep fryer,works well and looks nicecons: a lot of steam comes out of the handle openings on the lid
4,Very Nice,"I got this for my husband as a Christmas present. We love it and cooks to perfection! The only down side seems to be that when the grease cools down you aren't able to start the timer over again when something is still cooking, while using the two baskets. But other than that it is AWESOME!"
2,Does not stay hot,"Had I known how long it takes this fryer to get the oil hot, I would never have bought it. I use this to deep-fry chicken wings. My wings are supposed to cook 12-14 minutes at 375 degrees. This fryer takes about 30 minutes to get the oil to 375 degrees. Once I put the wings in, the temp drops to about 270 and will not come back up. No, the chicken is not frozen or even cold. It just takes forEVER for this fryer to get the oil hot. I have resorted to cooking the wings for 10 minutes, removing them while the oil heats back up to 375 (about 15 minutes) then putting the wings back in for another 3-4 minutes. I'm only doing that until I can find a replacement fryer. I see this is now ""unavailable"" - now I know why."
1,Don't be tricked,"I have purchased this item and returned it immediately. It does not come with the remote control.This machine is useless without the remote control. The seller is not Amazon. The seller claims that it ""clearly stated that it does not come with a remote control"", even though the picture clearly shows the remote control with the machine. The seller did not refund the full purchase price but only $202. I am at a loss. Don't get fulled and lose your money."
5,Knows what he's writing about,"I write thrillers (THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE) and read a lot of them. This book really impressed me because of its authentic details. Marcus Wynne is a former paratrooper and Federal Air Marshal. He knows this territory on a first-hand basis, and he writes so vividly that he makes the reader feel in the midst of the action. Highly recommended."
4,"darn good read, make a movie already!!!","In typical story telling fashion, the book takes the slow pace of building background and context of the characters. the descriptions of landscapes and landmarks used in the book were well crafted without being too detailed. I reinforced this by Googling the addresses in the book and though the addresses were not 100% accurate, the street views of the best matches were close to what i had visualized. the theater that the final battle played out on was well choreographed as the Marcus Wynne seemed to follow the pattern of escalation of the characters all the way to climax. Against the grain of ""rush to the end"" story telling so prevalent in these kinds of books, I did not realize the story was over until the last two pages. Thanks Marcus for w well written novel. Get out there and pitch the movie already!!"
2,Dan Miller: why is he even in the book,"All he do is sit there listen to others talk, pretend to be cool and then have a lot of sex. At the end he even fail to capture or kill Jonny but saved by her girlfriend."
3,"Blah, Blah, Blah!","Although Mr. Wynne's bonafides are certifiable he has little creativity. You do not have to read this book to even know what will happen. Just read the synopsis Amazon gives for the book. Mr. Wynne needs to use something other than bad/good guy, an extremely gorgeous woman (who is in a profession where there are very few pretty woman), some simplistic action to make the book longer than it should, and of course the ending where the good guy wins but just barely scenario. The action was accurate but mainly written for wannabe heroes reading it."
5,Jeeves and Wooster review,"This is so much fun! if you love PG Wodehouse, Hugh Laurie, or anything British it doesn't get better than this! Lot of light hearted, good clean fun and nonsense. What a perfect twit Bertie is, and Stephen Fry as Jeeves is superb. Lots of wonderful English locations, terrific casting and acting. I think you will enjoy it much more if you have read some of the books or short stories by Wodehouse, so you are in on the basic working mode of Jeeves, the power of the Aunts, and the cluelessness of Bertie."
1,"Looks like a bootleg DVD series, grainy picture quality, color poor","This is a very disappointing edition. The picture quality is grainy, and the color is poor. In fact, I am going to keep my VHS tapes, which are better, and hope a good quality DVD collection of this wonderful series is one day available."
4,If you are a wodehouse fan....,"The first two seasons are the truest to Wodehouse's style. The plots and dialogue come directly from the Wodehouse stories.The following seasons take quite a bit of poetic license but are still fun to watch.There's some substituting of supporting characters (for instance, Stiffy Byng instead of Catsmeat's sister Corky) so folks won't get confused trying to keep up with all the names (it doesn't detract from the story). Many minor and some major characters are left out to simplify the plots; and for some reason Sir Roderick Glossop is given a wife, which he never had in the books.Still, taken all in all, not a bad way to spend an evening. Oh, and the music is terrific :-)."
5,Everyone should own a copy,This is one of my all time favorite shows. Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry are hilarious. I would recommend this to all of my friends
5,region,"I purchased the complete series of Jeeves and Wooster and, nothing against Amazon as they don't control this aspect, I don't think, but to only have it in Region 1? As you can guess I don't live the US, Australia and I can't get it for region 4. What a bummer! Cheerybye Jeeves"
3,A great start...then a parody,"The first year was the best...great characters and plots.Then, things changed. The trip to America was excreble, the ""lost at sea for months"" was out of the beginning to a Monty Python episode. For the last year and a half of the series, it was a parady of itself. I kept waiting for Berty or Jeeves to look into the camera and give a wink."
1,"Fantastic series, but NO CLOSED CAPTIONING!!","Hugh Laurie and Steven Fry are brilliant. The problem is that the show's theme song is so catchy that if you are at all like me, it will stick in your head, repeat itself dozens if not hundreds of times a day, and even interfere with your sleep!And the theme song is the BACKGROUND music for the show and keeps being played in most scenes! NOT GOOD!Alas, the DVDs, like the VCR tapes, do NOT have closed captioning, so there is no way of avoiding having the jingly, ear-fetching, tune bore into one's skull!I'm an avid P.G. Wodehouse reader and love the humor, comedy, and wonderful timing of this duo, but the music overwhelms the pleasure!Why, oh why, did they not put closed captioning on these? Can the IDA apply here? Can they be forced to to open this up to the hard of hearing? And help the rest of us who'd rather not hear the music!"
2,A Puzzling New/Old Release,"The eight discs that clock in at a hefty 1150 minutes of wry British wit that stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry is a puzzling (re)release on a pair of critical areas: there is nothing new from the complete series that was issued in 2002 and the transfer to disc remains ""iffy,"" which plagued its initial appearance in the marketplace.Laurie portrays Bertram Wilberforce ""Bertie"" Wooster - the bumbling, dimwitted aristocrat - and Fry is the witty valet, Reginald Jeeves, in the series that is based on Sir P.G. Wodehouse's ""Jeeves and Wooster"" stories. The 23 episodes appeared on the ITV network from April 1990 to June 1993 and feature bossy aunts, romantic scrapes and a number of friends who just can't stay out of mischief.Hopefully there are plans for a definitive set and this repackaging of a prior release is a bridge to that end. Though the shows were outstanding, there needs to be a serious production makeover to make for a solid collectible for fans of all ages."
3,Technical reproduction problems,"Other reviewers have addressed the contents in great and helpful detail; I will comment on the reproductions, which are rather poor. There seems to have been some sort of ill-advised pan-and-scan at work; some parts of the picture are cut off, which is most noticeable in the opening credits, where parts of the credits for the author and crew's names vanish outside the frame.In addition, I am dismayed by the quality of the picture representation; these episodes badly need remastering. The picture quality is blurry and indistinct, and there seems to have been some color loss or color shift. The sound is rather less full than I would have liked, as well.Perhaps this is a result of the quality of the original recordings, but I do not remember such poor picture quality on my initial televised viewing."
2,A&E Continues to distribute bad quality products,"Jeeves & Wooster is an awesomely funny series. Sadly, A&E; just can't seem to put out a decent quality product. Everything I've purchased from them is lousy video quality.It's as if they farmed it out to some low budget duplication house to save a few pennies on the cost of goods. In reality they're only cementing their reputation as a company that doesn't care about their customers. Do some Googling and you'll find a lot of complaints about the quality of their products.How sad that a company that produces such great entertainment doesn't take the same care in producing their video products."
5,Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are awsome,"Loved the series, I think it should have continued. The quality of the product was new and arrived in a timely manner."
3,subtitles(sness) :(,"It's the outstanding series with greate actors. But there aren't any subtitles on the DVD. English is not my native language so I prefer to watch a movie and to read an english text at the same time.I bought this DVD, of course, and try watch but I'm sure that lost ~60% of the humor.Still: ~40% that I got is marvellous."
5,Fry and Laurie - a great comedic team.,"Possible only for those who know this duo and/or have read the Wodehouse stories. These episodes are so fabulous I cannot get enough of seeing them. All the characters, from frivolous young men in the London club, bossy aunts and scheming girl friends - British comedy at its very best."
5,Quite simply..... my most favorite series ever,This is truly one of the best series I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I covet it as my most favorite - the Jeeves and Wooster characters are absolutely impeccable and bloody hilarious! This is an absolute MUST SEE for Hugh Laurie fans (though you do have to somewhat enjoy the dry Brit sense of humor). Stephen Fry is... well... flawless.It makes you pine to have your own personal Jeeves! :-)
3,Thank the Gods for Stephen Fry,"This is an intersting show, and I'll have to give some the original written stories a try.Well, other than Jeeves and Wooster, pretty much everyone else is reprehensible in some way. (Heck, I don't even think that 99% of the world is) The stories are repetitive - Wooster has to steal something for an aunt or fried, he's trying to avoid a engagement that just happens, he has to reunite a couple, etc. Also, as is typical for British shows, no subtitles. Hugh Laurie is good, not great, but good in the show. Also, blackface episodes - ugh.However, Stephen Fry is great as Jeeves. He makes the show very watchable and a pleasure to watch work. A brilliant comedic actor. As Jeeves, he is much more limited in what he can say or do, but he pulls it off amazingly well with facial expressions. Worth the price of admission alone."
2,unaccessible,The show itself would get 5 stars but I have to give the DVD set only gets 2 stars. They have no Closed Captioning nor subtitles and thus these DVD's are not watchable by any of my Deaf friends. Very sad when a company completely ignores a minority because they are unwilling to pay the little extra to have captioning added to the DVD's. Shame on you A&E. I will have to re-think buying anything you produce.
4,"""I believe so, sir.""","You have to have a certain taste for Wodehouse's made-up world of total dodo-aristocrats. I find the plots quite funny albeit a little formulaic. Having watched a few of these, it is impossible to read the original stories without hearing Stephen Fry's voice as Jeeves. (For example, ""No, sir"" now acquires his unique intonation.) Separating Jeeves from Fry is like trying to imagine Rumpole as someone other than Leo McKern, that is, impossible. And reconciling Hugh Laurie's Wooster with his House is an interesting exercise in suspension of disbelief (which I happily engage in weekly).This set contains a lot of Jeeves and Wooster. I figure to watch it over a period of a year or so."
5,Really funny,"I really love Granada's ""Jeeves and Wooster "" series. This contains all four seasons. It's really one of the funniest comedies I've seen. Jeeves is the perfect mastermind and butler to Wooster almost as smart as Sherlock Holmes. All the episodes are funny, as Bertie goes into and gets out of one engagement after another and into adventures. It really is true to P.G. Wodehouse's wonderful books. It's a great series for the entire family to watch."
4,Great series; would be better if DVD had subtitles,"We ordered this set because we really enjoyed the series and wanted to enjoy them again. Unfortunately, sometimes we miss some lines of dialogue because there are no subtitles. The sound isn't bad, but it's often colloquial Brit.... I'm giving it a 4 for the series, but be aware of the downside, too."
5,Great comedy,"This series will have you laughing constantly. The acting is superb - if you need a lift up, this is it."
5,"Comprehensive text with accurate, beautiful illustrations","Richard Ellis portrays sharks in their many-varied splendor - from the peaceful, inoffensive species to the predatory varieties. His paintings compliment the text and photos perfectly, and convey the beauty and wonder of these extraordinary creatures."
5,One of my Top 5 books...,"In ""The God of the Machine"" Isabel Paterson provides a concise historical explanation of how human energy spawned the rise of all great nations, and how government interference via taxation, regulation, and conquest necessarily led to the fall of those nations. Of course, as she explains, the evils of government are a direct result of the wants and desires of otherwise good and decent people. She creatively and accurately labels such individuals as The Humanitarian[s] with the Guillotine!"
5,More than just a cookbook!,"This book not only has wonderful, tasty recipes, but it has a variety of recommendations for eating in more healthy ways all the time. It's wonderful!"
1,Tofu a no food for some types of breast cancer,"Eating a diet rich in soy can raise your risk of getting some cancers, especially breast. Make sure you emphasize NGMO Soy products only. As these may help prevent some cancers. But if you are like me, with ER+ breast cancer don't eat the soy rich diet - unless your dr. is aware of it - and you have all organic & NGMO soy. Also, have your Estrogen levels checked to see if you're at risk before eating too much soy. As a foodie - I miss tofu and soybeans. But I can't take a chance. I wish the title of this book would be changed.Sincerely,Julia"
2,Somewhat dissapointed.....,"I ordered the book as a Christmas gift for my Mom since she was just diagnosed cancer free. However, the front cover of the book has some sticker glue on it, where a sticker was obviously removed. I have tried everything to get it out, and nothing works. I don't think I will be giving this book as a gift though."
1,Not so good,These chips tasted very oily. I didn't like them.I thought they would be dehydrated vegetable chips.
5,"It's hard to give a toner cartidge a ""I Love It"" rating, but...","that's what I gave this one. It fit right out of the box with no hassles and seems to work well in my printer. We don't need to make color prints on this machine, just need good quality office-type copies. This cartridge does what its supposed to do and came at a price far less than I've seen elsewhere. So, I guess dependability, quality, and price do equal ""love"" in a strange way 8>)"
5,Ms. Rich is the genre's hidden gem,"Lani Diane Rich has got to be the most underrated author in the romance genre. Her writing is every bit as good as Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Jennifer Crusie, but somehow you just don't hear as much about her. I highly recommend all of her books. Her heroines are spunky and her dialogue is great."
3,Intruder.,"Corny,low-budget and yes not really the best or even a good movie, but one of those ""different"" movies whatever that means,I never seen a ""Supermarket"" Horror Movie except Stephen King's ""The Mist"" years after this and Before I saw this which I hated(the ending). So far this is the King Of the Supermarket Horror Movie Genre(If any),That's How I would label it given it's ""Original"" in a corny fun way. And For Bruce Campbell fan(not much of one myself) he's Hardly noticeable or Raimi."
2,"Almost good, but not quite","At the beginning, this is a promising little slasher film, typical of the eighties. Put a bunch of people in an isolated setting, then start killing them. And though the budget was obviously low and the story a bit silly, I still found it amusing.Then came the last twenty minutes or so where the killer is chasing one girl back and forth through the supermarket. Back and forth. Back and forth. It just got boring. Then comes the ""Twist"" ending, which everyone will see coming. By the end, I was just a little annoyed with this film, so I can't give it three stars. More like 2.5.Bruce Campbell is in it for maybe a minute at the end, but he is the best thing in it.Also, in the pantheon of super strong serial killers, this guy has got to be one of the strongest. He might even give Jason Vorhees a run for his money."
1,CRAP!!!,"This doesn't even qualify as cheesy grade Z horror -- this is just bad all around. I love a good slasher like ever other self respecting horror fan, but this doesn't cut it in any way shape or form -- it looks bad, the acting sucks, and the kills are way too amateurish to elicit any fear. Pass."
2,INTRUDER REVIEW,"LET ME START BY SAYING THE COMPANY THAT PRODUCED THIS FILM ADVERTISED BRUCE CAMPBELL'S AND SAM RIAMI'S NAME,EVEN THOU THEY WEREN'T EVEN IF THE FILM THAT MUCH. ( SAM RIAMI WAS HALF WAY I THE FILM AD BRUCE CAMPBELL WAS ONLY IN FOR A MINUTE AT THE END) SO DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU EXPECT TO SEE ALOT OF CAMPBELL AND RIAMI.OVERALL, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPOINTED WITH THIS FILM.AS A 15 YEAR OLD BOY,I EXPECT THREE THING FROM HORROR FILMS : ACTING, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, AND GOOD SCARES ( THE FIRST TWO ARE HARD TO GET,BUT THE THIRD NOT AS MUCH) SO WHAT IM TRYING TO SAY IS, THIS FILM FELT BORING AND MOSTLY ABOUT GORE.AND THAT'S A BAD THING,CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE AND CHARCTERS TO ROOT FOR.EVERYONE THAT DIES,YOU COULD CARE LESS FOR.THEY SHOULD HAVE CALMED DOWN ON THE GORE AND HELPED THE CHARACTERS A BIT.OVERALL,THE FILM WAS OK.DO I RECOMMEND IT?, IF IT'S UNDER $7,THEN BUY IT.IF IT'S OVER THAT PRICE,THEN I SAY NO."
4,A forgotten gem,"A lost slasher gem from the 80s directed by Scott Spiegel, Intruder is something unique indeed. What happens when the overnight employees of a local grocery store that's closing down are stalked by a crazed, bloodthirsty killer? Ridiculous blood-letting that's what! Though it takes some time to get going, Intruder features some inventive kills (with early effects work from KNB) and even performances from Evil Dead trilogy mastermind Sam Raimi and his brother Ted. Synapse Films has thankfully released the film in all its uncut gory glory, with a decent amount of special features that will satisfy gore hounds aplenty. All in all, if you've never seen Intruder but like discovering lost and forgotten horror gems, give it a try."
4,Very Original Slasher Movie,"This movie is very well filmed and directed. There's so many unusual camera angles! The death scenes are also very gory and detailed which is very cool. The stunts in this film are kind of bad. You can tell when the killer isn't hit by the bottle. The ending is somewhat predictable but still fun to watch. This movie is also very orginal. Usually a typical 80's slasher takes place in house, well this takes place in a supermarket.Positives - Very detailed and gory deaths, good directing, good acting, unusual camera angles, very orginal plotNegatives - Bad stunts"
3,They're slashing more than prices down at the Malnut Lane Market.,"A slasher movie set entirely inside a supermarket on the night shift. Cool idea and for the obviously low budget this film does pretty good. It's no FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 but I've definitely seen worse. NIGHT SCHOOL anyone?Opening with the store closing one of the cashier's ex-boyfriend comes to visit her fresh out of prison (for murder) and starts a fight. He gets kicked out, but soon the night shift crew starts getting offed in imaginative ways (trash compactor decapitation, head sawed in half, eyeball stabbing). Could it be the ex-boyfriend? Or is it someone else? Who cares as long as the bodies keep piling up. And pile up they do pretty good there for awhile but the Final Girl bit drags out too long.Worth checking out if you like slasher flicks. I enjoyed it and got a few giggles out of it. Also Bruce Campbell is only in the film for maybe a minute and the last minute at that."
5,A must own for Tracy Ullman fan's,"Tracy takes on Fern & Kay is one of the funniest tapes I own. Fern is your average Long Island woman. She has everything down to the trashy Accient. Kay is one of my favioret Charactars that Tracy plays. The typical mousey english woman who enjoys her scooter and ""Spotted Dick"" pudding.There really isn't else to say beside""s. ""BUY THIS MOVIE"" it's awesome"
5,Very detailed and rich,"I was surprised by the colossal amount of well-documented, rich and detailed information on the many aspects of the Roman Middle East contained in this book. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in this subject. As I am only a curious, not a specialist in the field, I was forced to get a map of the region prior to reading the book, because the only map provided in it is far from satisfactory. It nevertheless deserves a five star rating."
1,Rewriting History,"This book is more concerned with praising vices and poo-pooing virtues than with actual history. For example ""...Princess Victoria grew up to be narrow-minded and self-opinionated. She was also a terrible prude... Prince Albert... was even more of a prude than she was. He once said that the thought of adultery made him feel physically sick."" The rest of the book sounds like it was written by a British tabloid as well. I thought I was going to see something enlightening by reading this book. I was quite wrong."
2,Not impressed,I have tried other brands which have worked in the past and decided to try this brand after reading the reviews.It did not work as well.....
1,Naturals Phosphatidyl Complex 500,This product made me sick to my stomach and I was dizzy. I missed work. When I stopped taking the product I got over my sickness.
3,Second Class Citizen,"A story of an African American female's struggle for acceptance, this book is much like any other novel concerning women's oppression. If you enjoy reading about the horrible events that took place during the middle 1900's, then read the book. If you do not enjoy reading another book about women's suffrage, and do not want to feel guilty for something which you would never allow or endorse, then stay away."
2,a very personal experience shared.,"I enjoyed reading this book, but its written in very inelegant prose. There is a touch of conceit, and a certain holier-than-thou air about some of the paragraphs. But a moving book nonetheless. the blurb, I might add, is inaccurate. its not so much about being a second-class citizen in the sense of being an African in England, but being a woman in an african environment."
5,balanced works better,"To properly use this product, it must be sitting on a level surface. This blade balancer will allow the user to keep the mower blade balanced, which will increase safety when operating a power mower"
4,"I bet this is a great set, too bad I got the old version.","the quality of the colored pencils is amazing and the selection for the colors is spot on if you are going to use it for portraits. I would recommend this as an alternative to the larger sets.Item sent to me was not the new portrait color set of 24 colored pencils, they got the wrong picture here in the product page. This is the old version of the set that comes with 24 pieces (only 16 premier pencils + 3 verithin). It arrived fast, but the tin case looked like it was beat up with a bat. After doing some research I found there were 2 versions of this portrait set, but one says ""assorted Colors"" the other one says ""24 pencils"" this is the old vesion. Ask seller before you buy or make sure it does not say assorted in the description.They better change the picture here to match the actual item."
4,Good,Book of good yarns. All Will Rogers stories are worth reading. Must read for everyone who loves the west. He writes of what he knew.
1,Wrong picture displayed,"The picture shows a blue shoe but the description (in small print) said ""black"". I received a black shoe and had a difficult time receiving help from the merchant. They wouldn't send me a return label. They wouldn't refund my S&H. They took zero responsibility for displaying a blue shoe picture while selling a black shoe."
5,An excellent starter set of basic knives,"When my husband and I first moved in together and merged our household 'holdings' we quickly realized that although we now had two of everything, the one thing we completely lacked was a decent set of knives. After much deliberation we selected this basic set of Epicurean knives from amazon.com (for a very low price, comparitively). Now that we have them, I'm not sure how we functioned before without them! Each knife seems to be well constructed, and is carefully balanced for optimal use. All the blades are easily sharpened on the diamond sharpener that ships with the set. The storage block has a few extra spaces that comfortably accomodate the few other salvageable knives we already had. An excellent set of basic knives for any kitchen - I have been incredibly happy with the addition of them to my own!"
1,not a happy shopper,"i recently purchased the above item and in turn received another remote in its place after the seller emailed me back to say this is not the item anymore, but i am now out of $16 for an item i don't want, so this is not the item you're purchasing!"
1,Not worth Buying,"Just purchased this device 10 days ago (May 19, 2009). I have only RCA devices and this remote barely works with any of them. I was trying to replace an older remote that is no longer available, and even though it is in disrepair the older one still works better than this one.Main complaint is that when you select a device that you want to communicate with it only stays with that device for 1 button push. Then you have to select the device again. That is a real pain in the butt.I thought maybe that I just needed to select the right codes for my devices since it didn't seem to be working as I thought it should, but that was a big mistake. Using Code search rendered the remote completely useless with no instructions for how to get it back to the default.I now have a useless hunk of plastic."
4,Solid Pynchon silliness,"A fine book, inventive and engrossing in the wild way Pynchon is known for. Atypically brief. Not as satisfying as his more complex writing, but not self-indulgent either. Pick it up over his recent bricks."
2,Weak,I've read every Pynchon novel except for Mason & Dixon. Vineland is by far the most uninteresting and disjointed of his works. I did not finish it. I made it 1/3 of the way through. If you're interested in reading Pynchon I strongly urge you to start with V. and then Gravity's Rainbow. Do not begin with this book because there is a good chance you won't like it and thus you will miss out on two very awesome books (V and Gravity's Rainbow).
4,minor Pynchon is still Pynchon,"Really funny...Pynchon's inimitible style...it's no Gravity's Rainbow but hell, what is?Vineland : GR :: Sailor's Song : Sometimes a Great Notionand all 4 are top 5% fiction in my book.By the way (in response to an earlier review), people who know Humboldt County know how to spell it...And John Irving ""more substantial"" than Pynchon????Please."
5,Atmospheric Candygram from Mr P.,"If you've ever been knocked out--clean unconscious I mean--and awoken to strange voices and that funny taste of metal in your mouth--well that's what it's like to read this novel. To try and explain the book's socio-political meaning here would be difficult to say the least--it's as pro as it is anti--it simply throws the reader back on his/her heels to a time when America began losing its innocence, not just to itself but to the World in general. Good read--get it now."
2,Incorrect picture,Glove shown is the TM-Pact T/C Glove. The item description is the M-pact 05-010 glove. Make sure you know which item you desire before purchasing.
4,Great product.,I am a CNA and need to become more proficient in taking b.p. This stethescope is great. My teacher said it was really good too. It was about $30 cheaper online than at our local nursing supply store.
5,No Sabe was amazing,I first saw No Sabe No Contesta on one of the Spanish Movie stations on Cable and I just loved it. So many parts of it made me laugh and it's a fabulously made movie... It's quite complex but the love story in it is so cute and I just love how innocent the love in it is when it starts out. It's hard to find movies now a days where the people spend so much casual time together at first being shy before they end up in bed together. It was a well made movie.
3,Disappointed,"I read all the great reviews and tried to give it a try. It was a huge pain to work with. It started curing before I could finish covering the caliper completely and I was within the recommended temperature. The ""epoxy"" is peeling where some brake fluid dripped on it. It looks food, but for the amount hassle, next time I will just buy fresh reman calipers and get them powdercoated!"
4,very pleased,"I ordered this kit to paint the calipers on my Audi. With the help of my crafty neighbor, we soon had the brakes disassembled and preped for paint. 3 coats later, they looked fantastic. Don't be discouraged after the first coat...let it set then re-apply. Also, dont skimp on the prep work. The better you clean the surface the better your results will be. I used my own paint brush as the one include is a little too big for some of the tight places. A variety of brushes would yield a 5 star review.I would recommend this kit to my friends and family for sure."
5,G2 brake caliper paint,Great kit great price! This is my second time purchasing this kit from Amazon.com. Both times I had quality results from both Amazon.com and the folks at G2!
5,great stuff,"Great, but will dry up in a few hours. You must be prepared to do all calipers when you start. I put mine on during a rain storm, and it still dried rock hard and looked good even though it was raining. Didn't see that storm coming."
5,Amazing,"I have a number of live DVD's from different bands, and this by far is the best I have ever seen. If your a fan of Opeth then do yourself a favor and pick this up! Opeth truly are a great live band and the DVD conveys that very well. The DVD includes two live sets. First is Damnation, then they move onto the heavier set with songs from Deliverance. Bonus feature includes in depth studio footage, and interviews while making Deliverance, and Damnation. I have owned this great DVD for a good year, and I still watch it and enjoy it just as much as the first time. Also, the picture, and audio quality are top notch! GET IT!!"
5,A Beautifully Inspiring Look at Opeth,"This DVD embarks on a chance for many Opeth fans who have never been to their concert to finally see them live. The DVD includes songs from both ingredients of Opeth. A brilliant site to see such pure death metal fall into place with the beauty that is Opeth's melodic side. The dvd also contains a look into how they record their music and how Opeth creates. If you enjoy Opeth, this DVD will satisfy you until their next CD is made available. An amazing DVD well put together, and well worth any price."
4,"Not as heavy as you'd like, but still A-MAZ-ING","I'm gonna make this 1 brief: the making of doc was ok. the concert performance was amazing. like i said in the title, it's not nearly as heavy as most Opeth fans would like, but it is still a very moving performance. they performed most of DAMNATION and then went into the set of heavy tunes, ending with A FAIR JUDGEMENT, one of my all time fav Opeth tracks. Bottom line, if you or someone you know is even the slightest bit of an Opeth fan, BUY THIS NOW!!!"
4,Butterfly on a turd,"A great concert. The only problem is that Opeth's music is like a butterfly on a turd - for the first half of the show you get the butterfly, but then the second half of the show you get the turd."
2,What a disappointment!,"I had such high hopes for this book, but found myself sorely disappointed. Yes, it's a quick read (as one of the other reviews noted) -- that's because there's hardly any information in it! It basically offers the information one could find in just about any issue of just about any mainstream baby or parenting magazine: that children's intelligence is a combination of nature and nurture and that to maximize your child's brain development you should offer them a loving, stimulating environment. ... I find it difficult to imagine that any parent motivated enough to buy this book doesn't already know all that. There seemed to be very little practical advice (certainly almost nothing beyond what one could glean from common sense and a cursory reading of a few elementary magazine articles).In short, spend your money on something else. Maybe a book to read with your baby..."
1,Terrible phone,"I purchased this phone for my 90 year old mother. This phone is terrible! The ring was very low in volume and the volume control button didn't increase the volume at all. The volume for the headset was terrible and the volume control didn't work for that either. The call quality was awful. I sent this phone right back! Also, Amazon gets this phone through ANTonline and they have a terrible reputation as well. I only hope I am able to get my money back from them. Of course with a 15% restocking fee. Don't purchase this phone!"
1,Just plain bad,"I was excited to get this book for I hoped it would further my understanding into a subject I had increasingly grown interested in...The criminal mind. When flipping through it, it seems like a great read, complete with case studies and forensic psychologyLittle did I know that this was a huge step backwards and to the side from other books I had read on the subject. Not only was it not interesting AT ALL, I was horrified to realize that this even begins going into other subjects that are not even close to being scientific in nature.If you want to read about Freud or Graphology (which is a joke--about as scientific as phrenology) thats fine. But don't expect those scientifically invalid interpretations of the mind to help you better understand the fast moving pace of research and experimentation that is forensic science.Instead stick with Mindhunter, the Crime Classification Manual, or anything that has a research bibliography in the back."
2,"Don't be a victim, pass this one by","I read this book hoping that it would clear up the loose ends in the second installement of the series. It didn't. Instead, Green spun a convoluted plot that made absolutely no sense. Worse still, this book was in serious need of a good editor. There were some glaring errors. The dialogue was hokey and irritating at best. Green tried to keep her characters current with making pop culture references from 2001-2002. Most of the time it came off as a middle-aged surburban parent trying to capture urban lingo. It didn't work. And some of the references were tasteless- like the reference to R&B singer Aaliyah's death (which was mispelled). All of this I could have overlooked had there been a good story with a good mystery (seeing that it is in the mystery genre). But alas, there is not."
5,a great product!,"I took this product hoping to feel maybe a little more alert, and I can say that it has done that and so much more. Prior to taking this, it was so hard for me to get out of bed. I could literally lay in bed from 7 to 10 a.m. easily. And then I would lay around for hours in the late afternoon, and again in the evening. I just had so little energy... thyroid tests were coming back normal, so I had no idea what was 'wrong'. Two days after taking it was a weekend, and I was amazed that I woke up at 7 a.m. and surprised myself by getting up and getting started on my day. Only later did I think, hey, maybe it was that vitamin product! It has given me enough of an energy boost that I feel like my old self again. I'm so grateful that I decided to buy that first bottle."
2,Made me jittery,"I am one of those people who reacts to any medication with side effects that involve stimulation, so if you are sensitive the same way, you might want to avoid this product. I tried to space these out because you take three per day, but I found when I took my third dose around dinner time, I had difficulty sleeping and felt very jittery. These contain ginseng and I think it does not agree with me because of it's stimulant properties. Also - there are several kinds of ginseng and I can't tell what type is in this formula. So - if you want energy, these might be just the thing for you, but I did not like the feeling they gave me."
1,Sony Phone battery,This battery doesn't last as long as the original Battery that was 5 years old. I question if this was new; or used. It was suppose to be new?? Would not recommend to others.
2,Terrible ingredients but my cat did eat it.,"Check the first 4 ingredients: Brewers Rice, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Powdered Cellulose. Rice is ok but not as a first ingredient in a cat food; meat by-product is sketchy in general in a food this expensive; corn meal I have no great opinion of, but whatever; but the 4th ingredient - powdered cellulose - is sawdust. SAWDUST is not what I want to feed my cat, even to help her lose weight.No wonder this food feels so ""light"" physically. The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer."
5,Birthmothers: Women Who Have Relinquished Babies,"An important work! I recommend that all triad members and adoption social workers read it. Jones is not a member of the adoption triad (i.e., she's not a birthmother, an adoptee, or an adoptive parent). The author interviewed birthmothers and put important nuggets of their experiences into this book. Though we don't get to know any of the birthmothers in depth, we do learn how they felt about relinquishment long-term, feelings ignored by our entire society for much too long."
1,"Outdated, thoroughly refuted thesis","Contrary to the previous reviewer's assertion, the claims made by Eric Svendsen in this book have been thoroughly refuted by Catholic scholars. Two in particular:Robert Sungenis @ www.catholicintl.com/ and more thoroughly by John Pachesco @ www.catholic-legate.com/ . As to the claim that ""most Catholic scholars agree with his conclusions and admittedly put their faith in dogma, not scripture"", these scholars are not truly Catholic. Any ""Catholic"" scholar who would pit sacred Tradition (note the capital ""T"") against sacred Scripture renounces his right to call himself Catholic and has been infected by modernism and/or Protestantism."
3,gundam,had fun with it 100% i highly recommend. it was a fun build and my first build so i t was a but of a challenge but i loved every minute of it
5,Brilliant,Hardly a day goes by that it doesn't get played. He sounds like he's having a great time recording this.
1,"Pvt. Malone is great, the rest is twangy","This CD is WAY too country for me, and I am a country music fan. This is twangy, and exactly what non-country fans think of when they make fun of country music. Not that it's a bad CD, but if you aren't into hill-billy country, this CD is not for you (buy the CD single of Pvt. Malone if you want to own the song!)"
1,Kinda disappointing!,"This CD intrigued me originally, because of the Riding With Private Malone song, but really that is the only real great song on the album. The song just before it is okay. But by and large, stay away from this one!"
4,Enjoyable,"I liked most of the songs on this album there was a couple that I didn't enjoy as much, but I recommend it for some great listening."
4,Good price and service,"Got a good price for the product and decent service, although was not advised of shipping information, so could not track it properly."
5,Martin Denny forever exotic,"A master of exotica music, sadly he passed a couple of years ago, however his music will last forever."
1,Lame toy,when we got this we assumed their would be some assembly but not actually having to decorate the entire thing. It was a waste of 11 dollars in my opinion. It's good for those crafty people who like model cars and buildings but it's not worth the money you pay for it when you don't even get the paints with it.
5,A remarkably powerful play...,"Tolin's play is one that explores the human psyche deeply. It is a moving and telling script.The son is a gay set designer for the Met in New York. He's heavy into Wagner (and the play calls for lot's of Wagner background music). He loves his parents, but they really haven't accepted his orientation. He loves his sister dearly. She is married to a geneticist and is a committed pro-choice, pro-gay liberal. She gets pregnant and her husband and she have a genetics test to tell them about the baby. It's almost certainly going to be left-handed, intelligent, a boy, and gay.Hmmmm...maybe it's time to have an abortion...The resolution is powerful and moving...and you may not like the end if you saw the cable movie.This is superb theatre reading."
5,Must Read,Prior to reading this book I had an ambivilent view towards abortion. During the book my moral character and value system was challenged to make an educated decision. Whatever your position is on life vs death pre-birth - read this book and be prepared to be emotionally moved.
2,"Good start, fizzled at the end","This is a good story about how Ronald Reagan ""the man"" behaved as Ronald Reagan ""the President."" There are some interesting stories, amusing anecdotes and plenty of moral lessons. I enjoyed the first half of this book, but felt it really fizzled out in the middle and dragged on at the end. It was almost as if the author lost interest and had to fill some extra pages.I bought it after hearing Peter Robinson doing a radio interview and was really looking forward to a great read. Unfortunately, the anecdotes I enjoyed most I had already heard in his radio interview.The title is the true story - How Ronald Reagan changed Peter Robinson's life. While interesting, not worth the money for hardcover. I wish I waited for it to come out in paperback or show up at the library."
5,A Wonderful Trip Down Memory Lane,"Wow, it's nice to read a book that doesn't have a political agenda. This book was not written to convince Democracts to become Republicans. Rather, it's simply a warm look back at the wonderful man and president that Ronald Reagan was to us. I had forgotten about so many of President Reagan's attributes. Witty, funny, stern, and a man with incredible vision. Reading the endless anecdotes brought back so many pleasant memories for me. The book started strong and continued that pace until the end. I was sad when I had gotten to the end. I am proud to have grown up with Ronald Reagan as our 40th President. This book is a wonderful read. As for the negative reviews, I can honestly say that they must be politically motivated. Anybody who liked Reagan will have a flood of old memories come back when they read this book."
1,Not Touching Enough,"I was worried about this book because like all of the books I've read on Reagan, it really fails to introduce us to the man. We get to see the legend part, but I feel that we need to know more about the man. I was deeply touched during the Reagan years and I became interested in politics, but I need to see the man in his element. Try a different book on Reagan. You'll be glad to skip this one."
1,Reagan changed many lives,"Throughout his political career, Uncle Ronnie changed many lives not just the author's. Why look at all the poor & mentally ill he put on the streets while Governor of CA. Or how about all the people who had to suffer & die from AIDS just because he chose to ignore a growing epidemic. Then there was the excessive ""defense"" spending that put this country in the hole. Why it looks like he has changed each and everyone one of us, but was it for the best???"
4,Reagan's Warmth,"Peter Anderson's HOW RONALD REAGAN CHANGED MY LIFE is an insider's look at President Reagan grace under pressure combined with the pressures of serving as a presidential speechwriter. Reagan was his own man, as Anderson found out. Particularly insightful was the picture of Mrs. Reagan as ultra demanding and protective in order to allow Mr. Reagan room to be himself.In regard to speechwriting, Anderson bows to Tony Dolan as the enlightened one who always had the right answers at the Reagan White House. Perhaps the most famous episode is when Anderson recounts how he came to write the line, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" David Gergen and others wanted the line muted, but Reagan thought it was the best line in the speech and it was retained."
5,What a phenomenal book!,"Peter Robinson's book gets at who Ronald Reagan really was in a way that none of the other Reagan bios really do. It is funny, touching, and inspiring...a truly wonderful read."
2,Too small,"I ordered the 2x for my brother for Christmas, expecting it to fit like a baggy, hoodie sweatshirt. He tried it on and said it was too tight, so jokingly I tried it on (I wear a men's medium) and the arms were just about right on me. The body of the sweatshirt is probably a small 2x, but the arms and arm holes are way too small. The design and look of the sweatshirt were cool, and I would have ordered more for other friends/family, if the sizing was more accurate."
4,Star Wars Imperial Zip Hoodie,"My son loves this hoodie. However after a few wearings the zipper broke. Alas, it was a sad day. We did not contact the seller, however."
3,For Die Hard Fans Only,"This DVD is totally unauthorized, Muse did not participate and none of their music is used or played, which is a huge dissappointment. It is a series of interviews of past friends, hanger-ons and wannabe's, but it is interesting if you are as huge a fan of the band as I am and want to hear stories of what things were like for them in the beginning. The interviewees seemed honest, likeable and fans themselves so it was fun hearing from them, but you have to wonder how much truth there is to it all with no band support. I'd give it a 2 1/2 stars, only for rabid Muse fans."
4,Manic Depresion,"very good DVD with lots of valuable info on MUSE.if you want to know more about them,buy this DVD.Definitely worth it buying"
5,*****,"I was lucky to see this film at a screening where Armin Mueller-Stahl talked to the audience (and even played his violin for us!). He was as charming as this film. The film is warm, thoughtful, charming and original. I was disappointed it did not do better. It deserved to. A true gem."
4,My first Book on Paleoanthropology,"I own a copy of this book when I was a kid, and though some of the information is extremely dated it still holds a warm place in my heart because of it lasting influence on me which led to me minoring in paleoanthropology in college."
2,Product sent is not product advertised,"The item advertised is vegetarian capsules. The item that was sent to me was caplets which are solid tablets and are not vegetarian. I was told that this is not sent by Amazon, and therefore, they are not responsible for it. I looked on the Internet to see if I could find the vegetarian capsules elsewhere, and it appears that the company no longer offers them. Yet, Amazon continues to sell a product which doesn not exist. I returned the product for a refund."
4,Good entry level set,"Good tube, picture is clear and colours are vivid. Speakers are absolute garbage, but if you are into buying a large TV like this you going to want to run your audio through your stereo anyways. Basic set, component inputs for video and audio (rca jacks) 1 RF coax input and 1 S-Video input. Best results are with using S-Video input, with the component coming in a close second. Letterboxed DVD's are great to watch on this set. The only downsides to this TV are: the internal speakers, the setup menu can be confusing (keep RCA's support number handy), and the weight! - 180lbs! - Don't move this TV by yourself or you'll be asking for a hernia! If you're budget conscious, this is a good deal. It should last you long enough that HD widescreen sets will be going for the same amount of what you paid for this set."
1,Easy Rip and Tear a better Name,"Got these because they were on sale and same brand as the drawstrings they replaced. These rip and tear very easily, do not try to push any trash down to compact it, it will end messy. Very, very disappointed."
2,No Earthly Advantage I Could See - a review of Hefty Easy-Flaps,"I'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed. I bought them and find them pretty annoying. For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab' as the marketing info says. They just hang there. If you want grabbing, try Hefties ""Hefty Gripper Tall, 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags, Case Pack, Six - 40 Count Boxes (240 Bags). They're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps don't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags. Because of their construction they barely fit our can, plus unless you underfill them, there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic. Otherwise they fall far short of what's needed in the kitchen.Pam T~"
3,not worth the money,"We ordered 2 - one for each of my 2 boys ages 3 and 6 - and the remote controls work for both/either vehicle. A big frustration for the boys when they are both using them at the same time. Hard for them to control even one at a time, not the sturdiest materials. For all the money to buy the product and then ship, I wish I had bought them a remote control from the toy store instead of going with ""Grave Digger"" (a big love!)."
4,Great fun,My 8 year old loves this he is so creative with it and it maintains the colors in the machine so no mess.
2,misleading item description & image,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas 2009. What arrived looks more like the ""Alex"" branded spin art toy. The description says that the paints are water-based, but the paint would not clean off of the table and would not wash out of clothing (A year later the paint is still on our table and her clothing was thrown away). The paint is like runny t-shirt paint. Other than these disputes, this spin art toy was great fun. Based on the non-washable paint, I'd recommend it only for older kids who can play unsupervised."
4,excellent,Was received on time and in good packaging. Was very satisfied with the purchase and happy with everything once it was all processed.
3,The Iron Man's aide.,"I bought this figure, Originally, because i need the Galactus right leg. Here, in my country, this figure only arrived ""preordered"" and it was very expensive, if you can catch it.The figure is very simple and it has a rocket launcher and a machine gun in each shoulder.I think this figure was better than it really is."
4,"War Machine the good, the bad, and the awsome","War Machine is awsome, because he's like a black and silver ironman. Except that he actually has guns. Here's the pros and cons of this toy.CONS1. It looks like his waist is going to snap off. It's way to loose.2. The machine gun is actually attached to the figure and you can't take it off.3. NO STAND, only a freakin leg4. The fireing weapons don't fit in easilyPROS1. He's war machine!2. He's black and silver instead of red and yellow3. He has cool weapons4. His helmet actually stays on his head. The ironman's didn'tPRO AND CON5. Very stiff figure. (Besides the waist)"
2,temporary solution,"Not high quality, definitely not made for OEM replacement. It barely holds a charge, good for maybe 33% of capacity. Order genuine OEM replacement batteries, even a used one would be better, why take a chance?"
1,no charge on this battery,"I got this battery to replace a camera battery that wouldn't hold a charge for more than a few minutes. The ""new"" battery was even worse. It lasted less than 5 minutes and even after several tries was no better.It was worthless and couldn't be used."
4,Helpful in teaching Vocabulary,"This has been very useful in my 5th grade Language Arts class. The students enjoy completing the word of the day and have been trying to use the new words in class. In the classroom I have a student read the word and part of speech, then another read the sentence, and another read the definition and so on. We do 4 words (one section a week) and on Friday they share their written responses to the words with a partner. The students do this the last 10 minutes of class when other students are leaving for interventions. I would recommend this book to any teacher that wants to incorporate vocabulary in a quick and easy way."
2,"Good book, but beyond most in grades 3-6","The format and approach are excellent, and most of the learning can be done by the student without parent guidance. Nevertheless, much of the vocabulary is way beyond my beginnng 5th grade daughter, and many words were brand new to my 11th grade son. One buys books like these to take advantage of the experts understanding of what is the most essential, advanced vocabulary for the age group. The experts here appear to be off by about three grades."
1,SORRY CUSTOMER SERVICE,DID NOT EVER RECIEVE THIS BOOK. NO ONE EVER CONTACTED ME BACK. STILL WAITING ON REFUND
4,Keep the last bullet for yourself,"Good insight into the historical and strategic problems facing the American Indians regarding their weapons as well as problems the army faced. Mr. Marquis' conclusion that Custer's enemy was his own men's lack of experience and training, thus leading to the only way out for them is insightful and interesting."
5,No Compromises is a help on rough days!,"I enjoy this book as a daily resource of encouragement, reminder, and comfort for work. Sometimes I get stressed with workday activities and it is a comfort to go to a specific place in God's word."
3,Fairly good guide.,"There is a paucity of guides to Lucia di Lammermoor. Hence, I give this three stars although I wish there was some critical commentary and description of productions thereof. This guide does have the complete libretto with snippets of music from the key arias as well as the complete story behind the opera."
5,really good,"cranki wrote: ""... (*****) scrumptious... ...mellow and naif... the perfect marriage between noveau-dykeé folk goddesses Cocorosie and the straightforwardness of overproduced pop with a zest of jet-set high class from the Hilton sisters"". as you may see in the tracklist, the first one, titled ""I wrote this song for the girl Paris Hilton"" can deceive about his intentions, and maybe the reputation he has built around himself as an ""enfant terrible"" seems to dilute in this (i think, his) prima opera, but his personal approach towards music is now clearly lost in the lontananza of his early works in the band Grey with bandmate Jean-Michelle Basquiat.At some extent, some may say that he'll be better if quitting writting, directing and being a fashion model, to just make music."
1,"Somber, Sad actually just Vincent","This has potential but it sounds as if he's just tuning up for the real thing. Vincent is talented and the labels of egomanical or narcissitic is unfair. I think he is a man ahead of his time and he will be appreciated when he's dead which happens to many true artist. But maybe he should stick with acting, directing and painting. Music is not his area to shine in."
2,You people have got to be kidding...,"Ok, yeah, I liked Buffalo '66. I also sort of like the instrumental noodling tracks on this album. That's about where this thing stops, though. This is Vincent Gallo doing what all musicians do when they're bored, and then selling it to you and receiving 5 star reviews. Half the songs sound like someone screwing around on the keyboard with a background loop, and really, they're not so bad. The rest, though, feature good old Prince Vince singing. The tone and quality of his voice aren't terrible, but his lyrics sound like second graders writing love notes back and forth. It's really impossible to listen to, simply because I cannot get over how horrible the words are. The guy makes music like he paints. Dull, inane and lifeless. ""Most beautiful recording ever made""? Please."
5,"So plaintive, somber, sultry","Oh, man. This is a moody, quite lovely and cohesive album. The same resigned gloom carries through each track, though each is composed of different elements. There are some dark ballads, full of sorrow, but in a very understated way. These feature an incredible female tenor whose low notes just resonate in your gut, evoking images of sultry lounge singers draped across pianos. Other tracks are sexy mock-downtempo instrumentals, with looping bassline, looping saxophone, and other samples. Throughout all songs you hear this beautiful wavering electric guitar, and sort of a warbled vinyl record hiss that gives a cozy feel, like an old favorite book with cracked edges."
1,Terrible lo-fi indulgance,"Amateurish mopey audio muck for the most part. Gallo does demonstrate a small amount of recording insight when not obsessing over his own self-absorbed melancholy, but this unfortunately comes through more in tiny shades of instrumental flux rather then the concentrated efforts on vocal and lyrical pretentiousness of the highest order. With many a horrible composition guiding the arrogant actor's air-bloated voice, his disc will be relegated to a far off, cult appreciation weirdness, if that compliment can even be achieved by perhaps his few fans."
1,Had to return,After the unit had more and more problems loading disks (new) it finally stopped all together. Had to send it back for refund.
2,Was great at first but after 3 years...,"We bought this as our first DVD player. We thought Samsung was a reliable brand plus it had good reviews on a few sites.At first it was great then slowly we started to have problems. Last year we started noticing pixelation on some scenes but we blew it off as just something on the disc (dust, dog hair, etc...). Then it started doing it on brand new DVDs & everything went down hill from there.Now it skips scenes, freezes up and continues to pixel on scenes. Very frustrating! Sometimes it works perfect, other times you have to restart three or four times just to get the movie going.Of course the warrenty is expired & there isn't anything we can do except take it to ""an authorized dealer"". (Yeah, right!)We got 3 years worth of viewing out of it, but I was hoping for quite a few more."
2,Quit 2 weeks after the warranty expired,"I've had my Samsung P401 for just a little over a year and in general I was pleased with it. It played most DVDs with no problems. The only disk it wouldn't play was a badly scratched DVD from the library. I bought it because of the Progressive Scan and component out features, thinking that I would still have it in a few years when high definition TVs became reasonably priced. Looks like that won't happen since just 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired it quit working. No signal at all."
4,Samsung DVD-P401 is Missing...,"I just received my P401 unit yesterday and had the opportunity to hook it up and watch parts of a couple of DVDs and try out some of the features. Picture and sound quality on my non-digital (non progressive scan capable)TV were both very good. I listened to some audio CDs and CDRs and quality was as expected. Then I decided to carefully read the User Manual and figure out how to playback CDRs with MP3 files. Guess what, no mention of how to do this. Then I went to look at the original box and there is no indication that MP3 is supported! I got back onto the Amazon website and reread the two customer reviews that preceded the one you are now reading and they both indicated that the P401 plays MP3s. ....Bottom line: I like the unit for its DVD, CD and CDR performance, aesthetics and compact size but I expected (and need) MP3 support and now am trying to decide do I send it back or keep it."
2,A mediocre player.,"Very, very mediocre player: slow loading time, noisy drive, clumsy menus.As a progressive scan player, is well down below the standard set by the Panasonic RP-56."
1,Does not stay sharp,"I thought they were great until I got them home. Of all the knives I tried, they had the best feel. However, they simply do not stay sharp. I have to sharpen them after almost every use. Look elsewhere."
1,Fotografia Publica>Public Photography,Not the book--just three page article.Not worth ordering.Read carefully before you order. Get the book from your library. The book is worth every penny.
3,Hot to handle,A fellow passenger on a recent flight let me use herRCA dvd player. It seemed like a good quality setup.I have to admit it was hot to hold especially whiletrying to calm an 18 month old child (the child didquite down though.)
3,Adequate,"I kept this player because I needed the ability to play VCD and SVCD (including XSVCD). This is one of the few players that can do this.However, do not be fooled. The battery does not last remotely 3 hours (maybe for a CD but not for DVD). Maximum battery: 2 hours 15 minutes, not 'over 3 hours.'Good enough picture, and not too large a unit. Note that you cannot play and recharge the battery at the same time, and that the battery connects to the player via a cable and covers up the video ins and outs when attached."
3,The question is.......... Do you feel lucky?,"This product does deserve a 4 or 5, but I am unable to give it that high of a rating. I actually bought this after buying the Toshiba one (Click my name for that review). I seem to have bad luck with all these DVD players. There are only 2 reasons why I give this DVD player a bad review. Since I bought this to watch on airplanes and trips, this con is not such a big deal. When you attach the battery, the cords end up blocking the video ports. They really need to fix that. The other issue is a big one. Every other time I play a DVD, the DVD gets a rather long circular scratch on it. I have friends who also have this DVD player and it seems that every 1 out of 3 has this defect. So the realy question is, Do you feel lucky?"
1,Terrible Quality,"My player failed (stopped playing when hot) after about 45 days. The replacement player from RCA did not work *at all*, so I am waiting for my third player.Avoid at all costs. Caveat Emptor."
2,Good Unit but Can Cause DVD Wear,"I purchased this unit from another retailer about a month ago and just started using is pretty heavy in the last two weeks. I was watching a brand new DVD yesterday and could not figure out why the disk stopped playing and became distorted. When I examined the disk, I noticed that it was developing wear marks on the edges but I could not figure out how. Then I noticed that the wear marks were in the same position as the white felt pads. I believe these were designed to keep the disk from scratching if it was bounced due the portable nature of the unit. However, either due to the internal heat of the unit or whatever may be the case the pads seem to actually touch the disk and wear off onto it. I could not remove the marks and luckly was able to get a replacement for the disk. I also returned the player in hopes of finding another unit that was designed without these type of pads. It is a shame as overall the unit is pretty good for the price."
2,DVD Eraser,Plays your DVD but play it more than once and those little pads will permanently scratch your disc. It ruined so many we nicknamed it the DVD eraser.
4,TRAVELS WELL,"I purchased this model after booking three travel reservations. I traveled to North Carolina via air on May 10 and returned on May 12. The next flight was to Ohio on May 24 and returning on May 26. I then flew from NY to St. Maarten on May 28 and returned on June 1. Then my boyfriend had a flight to Mississippi on June 2 and took the unit with him. The unit handled all of the trips and travel without flaw. I was impressed with how it was able to travel so extensively with very little time to rest in between trips. The battery lasted for approximately 3 hours and the picture is clear. I purchased some really good headphones, which only enhanced the experience. It gets a little hot on the bottom, but other than that, it is well worth the money."
3,Addendum,I just got off the phone (for the sixth time) with RCA parts. The batteries and additional cables for this unit are not available. They *hope* they *might* be by July 10.
1,NOT HAPPY AT ALL,"I had purchased this for my 6 year old daughter for a 4 hour flight. Charged the unit all night long, let it run down to charge up again and STILL the battery life was not long enough to view the movie &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot;. The unit was so HOT my daughter could not have it sit on her lap. The volume is SO LOW that over the roar of the airplane even with earplugs..it was VERY difficult to hear the movie.Accessories should include an car lighter adapter__I DO NOT RECOMMEND this portable DVD"
2,rc5400p,Consider others before purchasing. Battery lasts only about 1.5 hours. Haven't been able to locate a DC adapter. Unit gets very hot. Too hot to hold in your hands.
2,not as good as the first bmore gutter music comp,"That Amanda Blank cut is a fake. No new rap. Just a beat with a sample of ""my p**sy is a giv"" repeated over it.If you dont have that first bmore gutter comp. get that one first. its waaaay better. more variety. better raps and etc.the beats on this new one have slightly better production value. some of those 8bit analogue sounds that made Spank and MIA blow up... but not the same level of track/flava.I would give it three stars. Its not bad. and theres a nice E-40 remix. But the fake Amanda blank track is a jip."
1,Terribly dissapointed with this t.v,"We purchased this tv just 2 years ago. It's the nicest t.v we've ever bought and the most expensive too. Tonight in the middle of a show the screen went black and a loud buzzing noise is coming out of the back of the t.v. It's toast, after only 2 years.!!! We have other cheaper t.vs that are still working and that are far older than this RCA. We went on the RCA website and can't even find a phone # for customer service and can't send them an email because their email form requires information from a US resident, not Candian (as I am). We will NEVER purchase an RCA again. I recommend no one else does either."
1,Worst purchase ever!,"We have always in my family purchased Zenith or RCA televisions so when I went to furnish a new home 2 3/4 years ago I bought this television for the extra family room. It was used maybe 60 times since late 2003 and then I just recently moved and decided to downsize. Being this television was practically new, I decided to keep it for the living room. HUGE MISTAKE, last night I watched it for about an hour, went to bed, this evening came home from work went to turn it on... NOTHING!!!! Tried everything.....NOTHING. Wanted a wall mountable I guess now I'll get one but I can't understand how a TV which now has been used maybe 130 times, not even three years old yet could just die. Stay far away from this product....GARBAGE. I'm going back to Zenith."
2,2 years - Kaput,"I also had this set for 2 years & then some power supply componets went out, around June 20th. TV repair company advised that parts had to be back ordered, with a estimated available date of 8/11/6. The sad thing is this TV is in a vacation house & had very little use over the 2 years. The set is always unpluged, when no one is there. My previous RCA TV lasted 27 years, without a service call...cable guy said it had the best picture, he had ever seen."
2,CONFUSION!,"ON THE ADD IT SAYS 8"" BUT WHEN YOU READ THE DESCRIPTION IT SAYS 8"" FITS STANDARD 6"" PIPE!! THIS IS EITHER A MISPRINT OR SOMEBODY NOT HAVE A CLUE TO WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IN 6' AND 8"" IS!"
3,towel set,these towels were delivered very quickly.i was disappointed with the quality of these towels.i do not think they were worth the price i paid.
1,Sorely in need of an update or withdrawal from Amazon Sales,The previous one and two star reviews are accurate. For me this book is approaching the 9 year mark. Many of the links are dead or completely changed. One of them is no longer a product for encrypting chat but is now a chat client that lets you talk to many dissimilar chat products at once.As fast as the computer world and crypto move a book approaching 9 years in age on these topics is sorely in need of an update or should be simply pulled from sales. Sorry Amazon but sometimes pulling a product from sales IS the best thing you can do.
4,"A good ""for dummies"" book.","A good introduction to how cryptography works. Very simple, yet accurate. It covers basically all the fundamentals of how cryptography works, how it's used, and how it *should* be used. Math is kept extremely minimal."
5,Amazing,"This cd is only a small part of what makes Navar. But to get a taste it is so worth it. Great rock, amazing talent and something to get you hyped up for anything. So be prepared to piss off the neighbors because this cd demands to be turned up insanely loud and prepare for Navar to rock your world!"
5,A Must BUY! The Mind OF Mannie Fresh!!!!!,This album is one of my favorites! if you love realistic and original style than this is the album for you! The hottest lyrcs beats and style! Holla bac if you feel me! ~1~
3,Not bad...but not great.,"Needs a lot more content, cities and places...just too uninteresting for my bright 11 year old. Was hoping for too much, probably. Not bad for the younger kids, though?"
4,Fun and Educatuonal,Great Atlas for kids. Need to make a new edition. My daughter had a blast asking us questions from the book. I think she learned a lot but mom and dad learned just as much.
3,Would be a better book if,"This would be a better book if it also included an overall map of the country showing all the states, and an index listing each state alphabetically and by region and page number."
4,Great book for older kids,"A friend recommended this book before either of us used it on separate 3000 mile car trips. We have three 5 year olds between us: two of them weren't interested in them and the other, reading since 3, liked to look at it occasionally but the activities were over their heads. I think it would be perfect for maybe an 8-9 year old, and I personally thought the activities were varied enough and educational to give it 4 stars. But I have to remember where I stashed them in a few years and try again.By the way - the best occupier for my twins was the dreaded DVD player. I resisted it until the second day, but since we returned a month ago they have forgotten completely about it. It was a real pain to put in and take out, but it's hidden away and will hopefully not appear until the next mega road trip (which will be VERY far in the future)!"
4,Great book!,Book to help explain the effects of growing up in an alcoholic home. Very helpful in identifying feelings and hurts
5,Explained a lot for me,"I first read this at 13 when I was struggling with my alcoholic parents and I found this book so helpful. I only bring that up as other teens and pre-teens looking for a resource may find it helpful and validating. It was helfpul for me to identify that what was happening in my family was normal in alcoholic families. I could easily identify what roles my siblings and I fell into which helped me to better understand them and msyelf. It won't fix or cure the problem obviously, but it does help a child of an alcoholic understand the family dynamics and understand that what they are experiencing is common amongst alcoholic families."
5,Incredible!,"Absolutely incredible and clear cut in providing valuable information for people with a history of addictions. Enlightening look at behaviors, attitudes, and goals for healing. I would recommend it to anyone who is questioning the reasons behind sadness, depression, anger and feelings of inadequacy while living with addictions. Guided counseling and this book have started me on the road to recovery and a more meaningful, satisfying and acceptable life."
2,Disappointed,I didn't find any information in this book that was particularly enlightening. Most was basic and there was little useful mention of how these issues manifest in adulthood---or suggestions for change. The author bounces back and forth from how it affects the child still in the alcoholic home to the adult child. It would be more beneficial to separate those stages and focus on one or the other. I found it difficult to apply her information in any useful way.
5,"Amazing, eye opening experience!","Never has a book impacted me so deeply and profoundly. I am 35 years old and I never knew such a condition existed much less did I realized I was directly affected by the dysfunction. I have lived the life of the ""responsible one"" for nearly 20 years and the burden of this obsession/dysfunction finally took its toll.I highly recommend this book to anyone that remotely thinks they could have lived within an alcoholic family. I am now seeking therapy and I'm looking forward to a much more fulfilling life and becoming the best father possible for my children. This book has helped to stop the destructive cycle associated with ACoA behaviors in my family and I hope others will find it to serve as a rescue device as well."
4,Fits a small size 16,"Nice suit, however, too tight in all the wrong areas and not enough coverage in the bust."
2,"Not ""Advanced""","There is very little ""advanced"" material in this book. This book contains lots of useful intro material for beginners and some moderately advanced material for those progressing out of the beginner stage. Be forewarned, however...half the book is composed of useless filler - a hierarchical dump of all of the classes in several different dialects. This was obvioulsy put in to bulk the book up by a few hundred pages and a couple of pounds."
3,Dissapointing,"The book promises so much and its list of topis is very good. But all its chapters are short and there is a general lack of insightful views. For advanced techniques, get Alec Sharp's book. For a strong design foundation, get Lui's book. This one will frustate you mostly. It has a good coverage of the difference among the different Smalltalk dialects, but this is far behind what the author could have done."
1,Horrible product,"You would be better off pinching your lips, than using this product.Used it multiple times a day for a week, and nothing. Threw it away."
1,I like Neutrogenas or Wet & Wilds lip gloss better . . . and they are cheaper!,The Freeze 24/7 lip gloss is horrible. It dried out my lips so much to the point they hurt. (I don't live in a cold climate either) I think it irritates your lips to make them red which in turn makes them look plumper. There is not a product line that will actually plump up your lips. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news ladies!!! I would much rather purchase Neutrogena or even the .99 cent Wet & Wild lip glosses.
1,"Cant Review Product, YET to receive it...","Well...I have waiting a month now, and have yet to actually GET the lip plumper. I will come back to write a review once I get it and can actually use it."
2,Arizona Rancher,"This is an easy read and moves fast. A light story with a fair amount of excitement. The end makes this book worth reading. It's the type of book one would read in the airport and on the plane. I rate it a 2.Phil Corlet, Sr."
5,You'll be able to taste the laap...,"This is a beautiful book about Laos, its people, and their customs. The descriptions of the food are spot-on and the recipes are a great bonus. As a transplanted Lao-American trying to recreate flavors of my past, this was quite a gem of a find. If you have any interest in Southeast Asian culture or tourism, you definitely must read this. The parts about Luang Prabang and the Plain of Jars will have you googling airfare to Laos in no time."
1,Do not buy this TV!,RCA discontinued parts for this TV. Only had set for 3 years. Part number 248399 (only $100.00) is no longer available. So the set is toast. I can not believe RCA would do this on a high end TV. I will never buy RCA again.
2,RCA,"The convergence CONSTANTLY goes out on this set and must be manually reset. This generally takes me 1 hour to complete. RCA, and their technicians, refuse to admit there is a problem and will not exchange the set even though I have an extended warranty. When the convergence is lined up perfectly and in HDTV mode, the set is great. Normal picture quality is fair and when the convergence is off, the picture has a blue tint around the figures."
2,Battery life sucks,"This is a reasonable phone features wise - but its battery life is very very poor for a Nokia.I had owned a Motorola sometime ago, and after that experience I swore to stick to Nokia because of the powerful battery life and excellent reception. But this phone needs to be recharged everyday or else, it just switches off. This is after power saving options like no screen saver, no display wallpaper and so on. I do not use the phone for texting, internet use, radio, camera or any of the bells and whistles included. So I am pretty disappointed with the result. The voice quality in the phone is also poor, especially when compared to some of very basic Nokia phones that I have owned. I also used to charge my previous Nokia phone just once in 3 days.Would not recommend this one."
2,"Nice Phone, not worth the hassle","I purchased this phone less than 6 months ago, though love that is durable and has amazing features, it is very faulty. First, you can't do to much customization to it or it will shut off. And my lastest headache, ""The SIM card registation failed"", it does this all day long allowing me to miss calls. I loved the phone so much when I first purchased it I recommended it to a close friend and his phone has the same problems + he screen blanked out."
1,Phone fell apart - LITERALLY!,The glue/binding that held the metal frame down around the screen started coming out and now the metal frame sticks up and will stab me in the cheek if I don't super glue it down every couple of weeks. Nokia/T-Mobile will not cover because it is cosmetic damage. Yes it is but I didn't do anything to cause it. Sound quailty is poor to terrible. Screen lighting is poor to terrible and features are not at all intuitive. Camera is simply awful. Pictures come out grainy no matter what. I'm in phone hell for 16 more months or until I break down and buy a new phone w/o contract discount.
2,Not very good,"Speakerphone works great but the sound quality while on normal mode isn't very clear.Camera is great but the like another person wrote, the buttons on the side is very inconvienent. You often find yourself pressing it by accident.Plus there isn't much ringtones to choose from. Not even normal phone rings if you wanted that.The back lid that holds the battery comes off very easily."
1,Not so great,"Nokia was my first phone and since then I have always wanted to return to Nokia because it was a great phone from all perspectives. I bought this one and quickly realized that Nokia is NO LONGER a user-friendly phone. I am not going into the details but setting options is SO complicated. Also, the front display glass broke the first time I dropped it - so it is fragile. Anyways, it is been sitting on my shelf after 1 month of use."
1,Wouldn't have bought if I saw it in store,"I purchased this phone for is small size. However, there's quite some stupid designs in there. 1. the socket of earphone is covered, you have to remove the back cover to plug in earphone!!!! What idiot designed that ?! 2. There's no lock for the camera button on the side of the phone. so you can easily trigger it and drain your battery. 3. Battery life is short. I don't know if it's T-Mobile though. I bought two new phones for a family plan. The Sumsung I carry around with me needs a recharge every other day. This one sits at home most of the time and still need recharge every 4 days. My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this."
3,"Good phone, if it can stay on","Features wise, the phone is good. Nice simple flip design, good sound quality, good reception, nice 'extra' features in radio and music player.However, 12 days of standby battery life is a ridiculous exaggeration. I don't use my phone a lot. My weekly talk time is probably below 1 hour. I don't regularly text, use the radio, use the camera, or the music player. Yet I cannot even have this phone's battery last for half its advertised standby time.Despite having properly 'seasoned' my batteries (several cycles of complete drain before recharging), the battery that came with the phone lasted 2-3 days (again, with minimal use). Then I got a replacement battery that's lasting a whopping 1-2 days.Maybe 12 days was just too much to ask, but they shouldn't advertise that standby time when that's not the common experience. I would even take half that, or even 4-5 days. Not being able to meet a mere 25% of its advertised standby time is ridiculous."
4,Decent Phone,"Pros:1. Call clarity [never experienced a drop call]2. Speaker Phone3. Design is almost perfect4. Software5. Camera [takes video too!]6. Manual button to flip open [comes in handy]7. Lots of data storage possible with microSD card (sold seperately)Cons:1. No USB2. Data port, Power button and microSD slot are in weird places3. WiFi would've been niceI gave it 4 stars as there is still room for improvement."
2,I am not happy with it,"This is not a bad phone, but after using the LG Muziq by Sprint, this phone is sub par indeed. My gripes:1. WTF can't you set an MP3 as a ringtone2. it comes with its own head set but no 3.5mm adapter to use your own!3. sd card slot is under the battery cover. that gets annoying if you don't have a usb cable4. charging port is on top of the phone which makes it awkward to use while charging.The good thing is, Tmobile gave it to me for free...now I know why, they probably are unable to get rid of them.My likes about the phone:1. it does have a descent camera and video2. it is easy to use like most nokias3. i find it to be very durable4. the music player on the phone is very good (although no MP3 ringtones)In summary, if you don't care about having MP3 Ringtones or using your own headphones without having to pay extra for an adapter, this IS a good phone that will stand up to everyday wear and tear"
1,I don't recommend this phone,"The first time I got this phone the microphone was broken. I could not hear anyone, but they could hear me just fine. T-mobile sent me another Nokia 6133, and it was working fine. I have had the phone for not even 3 months yet, and the microphone broke again. This time I can hear the other person, but they can't hear anything from me. Please, save your money and don't bother with this phone. It's not worth the hassle."
4,T-mobile crippled MP3 ringtones,"Just got this phone -- it's great but for one thing. T-mobile has pulled a Verizon and intentionally disabled setting MP3s for your ringtone.I was on the phone with their support for about an hour, going from entry level support, transferred to Nokia support, who, after about 20 minutes discovered that the message it displays ""Not allowed by activation key"" means that the carrier disabled that functionality. Then called back T-mobile and went from entry level support to second level support to tech support, each person saying surely it's a mistake, until the tech support people looked it up and said no, they intentionally disabled it so that you'll buy their HiFi ringtones.Very stupid. But the phone still gets 4 stars, because it's not really the phone's fault that T-mobile is turning into a customer unfriendly company."
4,Send Pictures work if you leave default phone settings,I got this phone since I qualified for a T-Mobile upgrade. I was able to send a picture but I then went and changed one setting on the messaging settings and then the white screen problem appeared. I called Nokia and talked to someone named Lydia. We reset the settings back to factory defaults and now it works.Call quality is great and reception in better than my old Motorola I had. Ringer volume with the handset when making a call is a little low but conversations come through clear. I get about 3 days on the battery but the phone is sometimes out of the network reach for a few hours and that will shorten battery life as it keeps searching for the network.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"When my boyfriend lost his phone, T-mobile convinced me to ""upgrade"" and get the buy one get one free promotion on this phone. It was a waste of time. This phone has neat features but it has the worst reception and sound quality I have experienced in a cell phone. All of the calls sound metallic, have allot of static, and the volume goes in and out. At first I thought it was just my phone, but I asked my boyfriend about it and he said he had the same problems. We have only had the phones for 4 days and we are going to return them. Im thinking about going back to my old Pebl phone even though it doesn't have favorite fives."
2,Loved it until it fell apart,"I got this phone a little over a year ago and really enjoyed its compact, sensible design. It feels nice to hold and use as well. After about nine months, the flip pins started to loosen and one fell out fairly soon afterwards. I tried to deal with T-Mobile and then Nokia and got no real assistance. Recently, the top of the phone has gotten shaky and the screen felt loose. In the past week, it's given me a ""SIM card failure"" message which disappears after restarting. Today, it's in a coma. The small screen comes on, but not the main- so no texting, calendar, or other text. It also stopped dialing. I'm very disappointed in this phone."
2,"Disappointing volume, otherwise okay","I selected the Nokia 6133 after researching a number of T-Mobile phones on Amazon, CNet, etc. After reading so many rave reviews about this phone I was very disappointed with the audio volume level on the handset. On the highest volume setting I have trouble hearing most of the people who call me. The speakerphone and headphones sound fine (on my side at least). Since I'm outside the 14 day ""no-questions-asked"" return policy I guess I'll keep the phone, but it's still a major let-down."
1,Not a good phone for anyone,"I probably spend less than 2 hours a day on the phone, but the battery on this phone only lasted a day and a half. The speaker only worked 90% of the time, I could not make conference calls (not without incredibly loud and irritating noises over the speaker), it would not recognize bluetooth headsets as it should, the camera was constantly turning on in my pocket, and the physical design of the phone meant it was constantly pulling out whiskers from my cheek, no matter how close I shaved. I returned the phone to T-Mobile after a week. Save yourself the trouble and get a different phone. I ended up with a Motorola V195. It's a great basic phone. No camera, no mp3 player, but it has every phone-related option that a phone should have."
1,Nice features when it works,"I like this phone but I'm on 3rd one using warranty and still over a year on phone plan. All have the same problem, display (both) stop working and all I have is a blank screen. Now warranty is up and I have to buy them, should take another 5 or so till plan is up"
2,Pretty disappointed,"As I renewed my contract with T-Mobile about 2 month ago, I decided to go with the Nokia 6133. Finally a nice flip phone from the Scandinavian company. Coming from Europe, I am very familiar with Nokia products, due to the fact, that Nokia is much more popular overseas than here in the US.But beside all my good experience with other Nokia phones (I owned about 5 over the last years), I have to say, that this is one of the weakest Nokia phones so far, for a few reasons:1. Battery life. If you do not want to recharge your phone every 1 or 2 days (at medium / low level use), stay away from it.2. Internal memory. More or less not existing. So forget about taking pictures3. Reception. At best on a medium level. Especially indoors the reception is more than poor.Overall, the phone looks nice, but doesn't live up to Nokia's standard (which I am used to). I have decided to go with a Sony Ericsson instead."
1,Bad phone and/or bad network,"I have owned this phone for 6 months on the T-Mobile network and had nothing but hassles with it (dropped and missed calls, poor sound quality, echoes in the line). Got a replacement phone after 3 month, no improvement, lot's of excuses from T-Mobile. Might be a combination of a low quality phone (the phone looks really cheap)and the T-Mobile network. Customer service is only willing to send yet another replacement or a Razr, that's it. I would stay far away from T-Mobile, cheap phones, cheap calling plans, poor call quality, ignorant customer service... you get what you pay for."
2,"Looks nice, elbow wore out faster than a cheap 9 dollar shirt","These shirts look realy nice, and we thought they would last longer than the 9 dollar shirts we get on sale at Wal-Mart. I work at a desk so my right elbow is constantly on the desk. I know that this wears on the elbow, but even the cheap 9 dollar shirts I bought that were really thin, thinner than the falcon bay sportswear shirts lasted longer. I was shocked when today I looked at the elbow and it was worn through. They would probalby work well for someone who does not have their elbow on a desk constantly but still for the money might as well go with the wal-mart 9 dollar shirts. Another negitive.. like many things these days, made in china."
4,Good product and good value,"I purchased this shirt for my husband. The color is nice and deep and the fit is great. The material is a little thin, but works great for a warm weather shirt for work."
4,Bonide Weed Beater - Observable results of use,"The product arrived very promptly. It has limited availability in Southeastern PA and therefore I had to order it. Shipping costs drove up the price considerably.Product has a blue dye that intensifies the color of the mixed product, allowing you to see the fill level easier on your sprayer. Simple but nice adder.My problem is ground ivy, which is very aggressive in clay soils with a substantial amount of moisture. I have noticed some die off and other weakening of the weed from use of this product. I believe that the Trimec is the key ingredient to its success.With my level of ground ivy, several applications are required to get this weed under control.The product appears to do a reasonably good job."
5,Great Product!!!,They use this CD in my daughter's preschool...she absolutely loves the songs and now we can sing them together at home and for family and friends!
2,broke in 5 months,"I really liked this VCR, especially for the money, but it broke after only 5 months."
4,Achievement with an Open Mind,"An achievement in rock-writing; a unique trophy among most rock literature. As a long-time loyal fan & follower of REM, I am subsequently cynical & quick to dismiss new books or stories over my favorite band. However, this book is a delight. Strong recommendation for those pure fans of REM the band, not just the music.The author's unusual approach initially put me off, but after a few more pages I realized the bigger picture being painted - the inviting storytelling & charisma. At times the book is as enigmatic as is the band. Good read, but check the facts for more accuracy."
5,Great Noir,"An Australian knock-off of the Richard Stark series with main character Parker ... except set in Australia. A very enjoyable read, though his books are difficult to find in U.S."
4,"Good Flag for the Money, Get's the Message Across","This flag does it's job. It tells the world that you dislike the current political situation in Washington,D.C and all the deficit spending. Get yours today and join the grass-root movement against big government and big spending. Great to carry to a ""Tea Party"" (Taxed Enough Already). The flag was a little lighter weight than I was expecting, but I have had the flag out everyday since Obama took office and it is not showing any wear or fade at all."
5,Profound and insightful,"Living on the Ragged Edge, although repetitive at times, is profound in it's interpretation of many areas of the Bible. As a young businesswoman living on the ragged edge, I found it to be painfully honest and a great source of inspiration for my future. Rev. Swindoll has a deep understanding of the professional world and at times described my life to a tee. I feel the content of this book will change my life forever and that the author is a truly ""inspired"" individual."
4,Wonderful book from a wonderful teacher,"This book is for any Christian or non Christian who wants help when they feel they are ""Living on the Ragged Edge"". Taken from the book of Ecclesiates, Chuck Swindoll takes that bilical book and applies prinicipals of living in our hectic, horrible, day to day world as we know it today and helps to us to walk that tight rope and keep our sanity. A great read for those of us that need it at the time and for those of us to store up for hectic times in the future."
4,A Request.,"I teach at my church and have needs for a lot of books. My question is, When I find the out of date books I can only order one at a time. How to I get around that when I need say a dozen. I don't want to pay mail on each order whenI need more than one book. I hope this is clear."
2,beating a horse to death,"I find this book to be very repetitive. I think it represents a failure to take form and context into consideration. I don't see layers upon layers of meaning here. The message is fairly straightforward. Sure, Ecclesiastes is repetitive itself but I believe this a poetic device used to hammer home the emptiness of life without God. We should be looking at the overarching message and avoid getting caught up in the minutia, which on their own and in isolation don't warrant hours of scrutiny. One solid chapter would have sufficed."
3,Pretty Good - - - 3 and 1/2 Stars,"LaRon has a very youthful approach or should I say outlook on life. You can tell that his writings are pesonal. I am impressed. They make you think about some of the heavier things in life. I for one find the upbeat chapters more appealing, over all I would say...If I had to rate this book, I would give it, 3 1/2 Stars out of 5. This is a pretty good start. I would love to see where he goes from here."
1,Dog with Fleas,I do not recommend the Samsung unit. Buy the Toshiba SD2700 which I also own. The SD2700 is hands down the best player on the market for the money.
2,skips like a demon!,"played exactly one dvd in this brand new unit - skipped badly, even though the same dvd played in another make of player. remote feels junky. when i return, will buy another make of player."
1,not worth more than 10 dollars,I had to take this DVD player back twice before I just said to myself to het to sony DVD player. Sure it cost more but I dont have any porblems. NEVER BUY THIS DVD PLAYER!
3,Where's The Full Screen?,"Overall, this player gives an excellent picture with a reasonably easy to use remote. Main reason purchased was to hopefully enjoy what Sound & Vision magazine touts as the first player to be able to view any DVD in a full screen mode. Not so--any DVD in 2:35 format will not fill the screen when the ""Fit"" button is pushed on the remote. Symbol indicates ""DVD software will not allow."" I believe we are like many others who have resisted DVD's due to the widescreen only format on most DVD's. My wife would rather view full screen VHS! The M301 does represent excellent value, however. I'm keeping it!"
1,Not what its cracked up to be...,"When this player actually PLAYED DVD's, and CD's it did a nice job. However, the playing part was where this player had most of its difficulties. Often, i would put in a homemade CDR, and it would start playing in the middle of the track. I would have to take out the disc, turn off the player, and reinsert the disc until it decided to play the tracks from the beginning. It must be the CD's i thought. So i played the discs that were having trouble on my Toshiba SD 2700, and suprise ,suprise, no such problems. DVD's were not much better. The discs would often skip annoyingly, and once again i would have to remove the disc, turn off the player, and reinsert the disc. I dont know if i just got a dud player, but i'll tell you one thing: i will no longer by no-name company's product for the sake of saving a few dollars. I will be sticking to the Toshibas, Pioneers, Sony's and Panasonics."
1,[price]no good,I was looking for a nice dvd player and a stumbled on the SamsungM301. It looked nice and it had some nice features but when I hooked it up thats when it all started. First I put a music cd into test the player. All it did was flash no disc. After that I put in a dvd it would play that and it worked great. But then I wanted to watch Rush Hour 2 and the it would play but the picturewas black then it got light then it got black again. After that the picture was split and very jumpy. So I took it back and they gave me a new player. I took it home and this time it would play a music cd but it would not play a dvd. Whats the point of buying a dvd player if it will not play a dvd. Back in November my friend bought a Hitachi dvd Player and he has no problem there yet. DON'T BUY THIS PLAYER EVER.
2,Bad Player,"Player kept losing picture for some reason.I thought I had bad DVD, tried it with my one year old Pioneer Player and it worked flawlessly."
3,not impressed!,"i've enjoyed everything i've heard by afr, but this is not what i expected from their first lp. it doesn't live up to the power of their previous releases. there is no great standout song like 'coffee black', or 'home is where the heart aches'...i don't think fans of their earlier stuff will really like this as much. i feel a little let down by their turn to a more media-friendly rock sound."
3,dalek,its nice that it talks & moves around. but its delicate & only 2 1/2 inches tall.its worth about half of what i paid for it
3,damaged dalek,"My dalek got damaged while I was opening it. It is almost impossible to get the holding wires off without unscrewing the bottom. This is the same part you will need to unscrew to change the batteries eventually. There is a very small part which is unsecured, and will fall out unnoticed when you unscrew the bottom. It is the part that you push on to make your dalek talk, and when you pull back on your dalek to make the wheels turn, it acts as a glider so that your dalek rolls around easily. Now to make my dalek talk, I have to insert a very small probe to push the button, and my dalek does not roll around at all, even though the wheels work well. Otherwise, I would love my dalek.2.5"" Classic Doctor Who Talking Dalek with Menacing Dalek Motion (One Random Color Dalek)"
3,Better than expected,"I wasn't sure if this was something that I would like, but it actually works for me.At first I thought that it was pretty lame, but the more I do the exercises, I have to admit that they are very beneficial."
3,boring,The DVD arrived OK but didn't play on some machines. The workout moves are OK but the way they are presented is pretty boring. It was a disappointment.
3,It's OK.,"It doesn't really seem like it'll work, because it's too easy. Even the advanced moves seem a little on the light side."
3,HUH???,Don't remember GETTING this one.... don't see it anywhere... wife doesn't remember ordering it... hmmm it's a mystery.. oh well
5,Get fit with Joel,Joel harper came with this video for people over 50 is just what you need for your health.I hope he can produce another one. Thank you JoelMetin Karaca
4,Good home workout for those gym off-days,"As a fan of Dr. Oz, I checked out this video online and liked other reviews of it. I'm over 50 and looking for a workout routine to do at home so I purchased it. What I like about the video are the variety and pace of the workout routines, which cover upper body, lower body, and abs. Even better is that there are 3 people on the video following the workout routines at different levels - basic, intermediate and advanced - so you can follow whichever level/person you're most comfortable with and then challenge yourself by kicking it up a level if you wish. I use this video to supplement my gym workouts and recommend it."
4,Joel Harper's Firming After 50,"This DVD has made me yearn to stretch, move and get the kinks out on days when I don't swim... No, I still cannot find time to exercise every day of the week (I know, different areas, different exercises to rest some muscles and use others...) but this gives me the option of doing at least one set of exercises or even all the exercises on days at home. And then everything is on three levels... some days I can cheat and make it easy or even rev up some and ease up on others. Not getting tired yet and I've gotten others hooked on it also!"
4,Joel Harper's Firming After 50,This is great for anyone over 50. Most exercise videos today are just too extreme for anyone over 50. Joel Harper's Firming Over 50 goes at the right pace and you progress at the speed that is comfortable and safe for you.
4,"Good Workout - annoying ""inserts""","This workout is not for beginners even is there is an older woman involved at the ""beginner"" level - its pretty intense for a beginner and I would not recommend it for such. If I were a beginner, I'd be discouraged right away. But I'm not a beginner so it was challenging for me. The little ""food for thought"" interjections annoy me so much that I basically dislike the two main workout sessions for that reason. If you don't mind this, you'll probably like the workout. And if I could simply make them go away, I'd like it too. But I will keep the DVD because of the abs workout, which pleasantly has no ""inserts"". Just FYI, my favorite workouts are ""Walk At Home"" DVD's with Leslie S. and the yoga DVD's featuring Rodney Yee."
4,fun workout,"Enjoy this workout. It is made so there are 3 people working out simultaneously. One doing an easy version, one an intermediate, and one doing the hardest. It's easy to find your comfort level and my daughter and I work out together, she doing the hardest and I doing the intermediate."
2,Should be for over 70!,"I am 55 and just started getting in shape 8 months ago after a life of office work. I have been working out on a treadmill and doing some weights and exercise bands. I thought this would help with core muscles. Surprise! These exercises might be OK if you are just starting, but I think the target audience should be 70+, not ""over 50."" I'll give this to my mother-in-law (75)!"
5,That man tried to kill me!,"So, I thought I was in pretty good shape for my age. I walk daily and have active days chasing kids around at my work as a teaching assistant. When he said not to do this workout daily, I wondered why not? I thought it would be too easy, but this workout was a wonderful challenge. I could not even complete the abs section at first, and thought I was near death. I was very sore the first day after I did the workout, so my muscles told me that they needed this.It was a worthwhile purchase and a great value at this price."
4,Good Exercises Poor Quality tape,This is an excellent workout program. Just need to spend a little more effort in manufacturing the discs.
4,A little fast moving,"There's a big difference between fifties and eighties. The exercises are great, but trying to keep up with video is kinda difficult for us oldsters. There are three sets on the video: upper body, lower body and abdominals. We try to do one set every other day, but maybe we can work our way up to more. Nevertheless, we feel pretty good compared to some others we know and will keep trying."
5,Joel Harper's Firming After 50 DVD,"I saw Joel on a PBS channel and immediately bought the DVD. I would definitely recommend this video for anyone, especially ones who are out of shape or limited in their abilities. It has beginner, intermediate and advanced on the screen at all times. Really easy to do stretches. Ask your doctor about your limitations before doing the stretches. My doctor modified one of the stretches for me. I think it is great since I cannot do all the faster, more complicated exercises. Really makes you feel good. The product came in excellent condition and in a timely manner. Thanks Amazon for the great price."
3,Boring,"The video isn't awful but it isn't motivating at all. He almost speaks in a monotone and although the exercises are somewhat adequate, I thought there would be more of them. Would not recommend to anyone in decent physical shape...more of a toning for someone who's neglected themselves a bit and wants to start firming."
4,Joel Harper's Firming After 50,"Excellent video, but like any exercise program, self-discipline is key. I am still working on the latter."
5,Fitness variety,This is a great DVD. I like that you can work at different levels at your pace. I like the variety and have purchased other tapes of Joels. Enjoy
3,harpers firming tape,I found this too difficult to stick with and it seemed to focus much more on firming muscles rather than actually losing weight.I am giving it a neutral rating because it might be great for a lot of people with different priorities.
5,Great workout for anyone!,"I find myself looking forward to this workout. It's divided into sections (upper, lower body, and abs.) so I can do the whole workout or use different parts on alternate days. Because advanced, moderate, and beginner are shown at the same time, it's easy to choose what works for me. I enjoy the short interjections about the positive aspects of working out while the full screen continues the routine. Certainly anyone who is just starting out, or over 50, would find this a worthwhile workout."
5,not just for over fifty,"This is an excellent workout video. As someone over 70, I find that I can do all the exercises at one of the three levels. It would also be very useful to anyone with an office job. All major muscle groups are worked as well as emphasis on improving balance, posture and relaxing tension. Highly recommended."
2,Not thrilled with this exercise video,I am 58 and have chronic pain. Bought this video in hopes it would prove appropriate for my age and condition. The upper body bending over at the waist exercises are not good for my back. The abs exercises are way beyond my capabilities. The little commentaries by celebrity doctors are just plain annoying. The video is shot with changing speeds and views of the exercises making it difficult to follow along. No music to help you keep time.
1,very annoying,"I picked this up with some Jane Fonda dvd's. The Jane Fonda is so much better than this. I doubt I'll ever use it. The guy has his mother showing the exercises and every 2 minutes he repremands her. ""Mom, keep your arm this way or that way"" ""Mom, remember to do this or that"" If that's not distracting enough, every few minutes a little window pops up with someone else saying stupid remarks like ""did you know exercise can reduce your blood pressure"" or ""excercise can increase your metabolism"" Duh! Just a very annoying excercise dvd. Wish someone had told me how awful this was. Not worth paying to return it. If you're in doubt, try a Jane Fonda DVD. She politely reminds you of the proper positions and posture without being overly annoying."
4,Didn't scare me away the first time I tried it.,Good over all workout.Some of the moves were not good for 66 year old knees.Have had both hips replaced in last five years...most recent in Sept. '12. Moves seem compatible with rehab moves.I will continue to use the workout on a regular basis.
3,Worth the price,"At 72, I am, I believe in relatively god shape, but after the first time following the tape I was tired and had used muscles that had been rusty. There are, however, a number of exercises that a person with back issues just cannot do. I wish there were more exercises that dealt with bad back issues."
4,I'm over 50 so it works for me.,"I've been doing the exercises for only a week now, so can't say too much on results, but i can keep up with the intermediate pace so that makes me feel good."
5,Awesome,i am hoping that it will help me firm up! So far things are going well and I hope to continue.
3,Serious,it's a good workout; just very very dry. I was just looking for something a little more fun with music.
5,Great Simpsons Book,This was the first simpsons comic book i got and i loved it which has led to me now having over 30 simpsons comic books this book is great and one of the better ones i have read
3,4 comics,"There are only 4 comics in this book. There are usually 6 in the other comic books. The names of the comics are Bart Simpson Menace to Society, Bart Simpson High Flyer, Bart Simpson Boy of Mystery, and Bart Simpson Little Rascal."
5,mwreview trash,"Mwreview you are the biggest idiot i've seen, quit waistin serious people's time ( too bad they let 13-17 year olds post on here) bart simpson is superb the best out on the simpsons. So don't pay attention to mwreview's idiotic post (i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are cool...White Trash that sums you up :) have a nice day"
4,Well thought out...,"I was really impressed with not only how wonderfully the book related to children, but to the colorful art work as well. My son asked lots of questions and related this book to his life."
2,Not quite what is pictured,"Well, I got this but there was no pad as described. Also, the batteries were years old, and corroded inside the alarm, so it had to be cleaned / scraped and new batteries put in before it was usable. On the other hand once I did that, it did work and I got by without the advertised and pictured attached pad, so I kept it. Still, I'm disappointed in the condition I received it in, and that it was not as advertised."
1,Completely non-interesting to non-Catholics,"If you're not a Catholic, this book will hold no entertainment for you. It revels in all the martyrdom myths of Catholicism in all its gory details and with nothing but saccharine reverence for the martyrs and their supposed ""great deed"". Most sickeningly of all, the book ends with an open invitation to the reader to die for his faith himself!(""Who knows why the martyrs and saints of the future will be? Maybe you?"") In a world already torn apart by religious battles and strife, such a comment is at best irresponsible and at worst catastrophic. This book does not belong in an enlightened age. Good riddance to it!"
2,Too much economy not enough nature.,"The title of this book is a bit misleading as the titular pond plays a minor role. This book is mainly concerned with the economic history of New England; the secondary concern is the effect this economic growth has had on New England's environment. As an overview of New England's growth from colonial struggles to industrial age giant, this book performs admirably and the material is well researched and documented. As a description of the environmental changes brought forth by this growth, the book is not quite as successful.The author occasionally intrudes with first person commentary, which seems strangely out of place and this often relates to the environmental impact of New England's economic transformations. A bit dry in tone with an annoying choice of typeface, Reflections is a work that will enhance your knowledge, but not necessarily entertain you at the same time."
5,Superb item,My 3 yer-old son enjoys this DVD together with Opposites DVD. I wish I had it earlier for him
5,Motorized madness,I really liked the way this DVD was presented.The names of each machine was explained as it showed how it worked.The segments were just the right amount of time.My grandson loved it
5,When only the best will do,This was without a doubt one of the best books purchased in a very long time. Concise and to the point. I reccommend this to everyone.
2,I'm not sure what to think. And I don't mean that in a good way.,"There's a couple layers here. There's interesting material (a lot cribbed from other sources, but still interesting). There's an extraordinarily self-conscious branding attempt. There are a couple different pseudonyms such that the author's identity is pretty confused. There's an effort to get readers to think about a lot of things that are worth thinking about.It's a fun read. Just don't take it as seriously as it wants you to. And if you've read a lot of Robert Anton Wilson or Buckminster Fuller, it's probably not worth your time. Basically, I'm not sure to what extent this is an attempt to capitalize on the work of authors writing in a certain niche and build a brand around it, and to what extent this is interesting, original material."
4,A strong work,"In a time and country where important matters consume us most,this book serves not only as an effective tool kit but truly interesting ride.It would be a daunting task to try and unpack the thought structures surrounding current events, but to so from within an interesting story written in an unconventional way should interest us all.When the truth is delivered well, it remains timeless.Current events reach back to the past and also remain personal to those wound into this TWISP.I went to Bennington, I still cant decide if I remember Howard as bat squat crazy, or brilliant. Either way this book hits one out of the park."
5,wonderful book,"I came across this book online actualy and read the majority of it in one afternoon, which is really saying something for me since I usually take a month to read books since I am slow reader and get distracted quite easily.Can not say the precise reason why it is so good, just that at the time and place which I came across this book it hit me strong and hard and I just adored the book.I have now read it a couple more times and each time I am able to pull something new from it. I am glad I have it in my library and I would strongly suggest it to anyone."
4,Basic shifter needs,One shouldn't hope for too much at this price but for kids equipment or for test projects they do the job just fine. I don't know if your situation would apply but I've found at least 5 situations where they did the trick so I'll probably be buying more at some point.
2,Cheap and awkwardly sized,"I purchased both this and the matching one with shorts and was disappointed by both. The material is as sheer as tights. The bottom is too long, like you can almost see in the picture, its actually tied very high on the hips. That is because it's too high in the back. Would not recommend."
4,great book,Book teaches history and many aspect that can be applied in life. I have learned more things in this book than high school or some college class has ever thought me. Great book to have.
1,Jewish love,"For the price of the book and the content is too much to desire. There are so many more poems, that should be printed."
1,a dog,"Consumer Reports gave this DVD player a Best Buy in 2001. I learned to be wary. This machine is a piece of junk. Very slow operation, confusing control panel, plays DVD decently but don't try to play CDs- they will skip in spite of every attempt to clean the disk or laser. I wish I returned this when the problems first started on day one."
2,If I had it to do over...,"It's a nice player for the price, but it has major issues. It won't play CD-R music CDs. It is very VERY sensitive to disc damage, the slightest little scuff will cause it to skip. After about six moths of use, the carousel tray (on mine) will no longer stay open, and will not rotate while open.If I had it to do over, I'd never have purchased this unit. As soon as I can afford to replace it, this baby goes in the trash can."
2,Bad Company,"The premise of this book is wonderful - tracing the path of a Buddhist monk who is reputed to have traveled from Afghanistan, across China, and on to the Amreicas in the 5th century. One might expect, at the least, that a poet writing about his travels would produce a book that would have beautiful descriptions of people, places and things. At best, one could hope for exploration of insights and thoughts about what it is to be a traveler - actually and metaphorically, and speculation about the spiritual import of such a journey.Unfortunately, what we get in this book is a collection of places vaguely described by a depressed man who spends most of his time writing about himself and his reaction to the places so ill-described. Frankly, this self-described ""grumpy"" man is not very good company for this trip, and all we are left with is a sense of trip of wonderful possibilities unrealized. The only thing impossible about this journey is the writer."
5,Very Warm & Fits Well!,"I just got this jacket, in fact, I bought 2, the black and ""loden"" colors. I returned the ""loden"" one since it is actually a green jacket. The picture on the web looks like a charcoal color. Anyway, I kept the black coat, it fits very, very well, not big or small and I wear a lot of layers of clothes in the winter. It also looks great, I think because of the way the quilted lines in it are. And it's very, very warm & what a great price! You can't beat it! If you are looking for a very warm, fitted jacket, this is it!"
5,The New Arthritis Breakthrough,I advise anyone with arthritis to read this book. You will never hear about this vital information from established medical practitioners. The pharmaceutical industry has persuasive power over medical research that may work to vastly prolong medical breakthroughs from reaching millions of arthritis sufferers. I found this book fascinating.
5,Make your physician listen to this or find one who will,"This book is readable and makes sense. If you have an inflammatory form of arthritis, this could be the answer--an antibiotic treatment which has none of the devastating effects of accepted treatments. I just read this book and am looking for someone to prescribe and monitor the treatment for me--preferably in the US Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico."
5,It works.,"I read this book and found a doctor at Beth Israel in Boston who put me on minocycline in the hope that I would go into remission in 2 years. When I drove to the appointment to see him my RA pain was so bad I could barely grip the wheel and I literally could not lift my coffee cup with my right arm cuz my elbow hurt so bad (strangely, the only non-symmetrical pain I had). I had to reach over with other arm to lift it! I am now beginning my third year and am improved... Not CURED, but let me put it you this way: I don't cry every day anymore. That's HUGE."
5,Association of arthritis with Lyme disease,"There is a growing body of evidence that arthritis is one of the manifestations of Lyme disease (infection with B.b. - a spirochete). The reason for arthritis symptoms improving when taking this antibiotic for a long time, as recommended in the book, is that the B.b. is killed. I recommend that everybody with arthritis look this up in the internet. The regular physicians are not very familiar with this connection."
5,The New Arthritis Breakthrough: The Only Medical Therapy Clinically Proven to Produce Long-term Improvement and Remission ...,"An excellent book for newly diagnosed people with RA who are unaware of alternative treatment available using anti-biotics, instead of current medications perscribed by mainstream doctors, which I believe are destructive to the human body.Unfortunately doctors do not feel free to administer anti-biotic treatment because it is not approved, yet they can administer drugs that have destructive side effects. I did not feel I could survive the strong drugs being used as the standard of care due to my age. Luckily I found this alternative that has given me hope. Although I have just begun treatment I am experiencing improvement.The book also has information on The Road Back Foundation, a resource for people affected by arthritis and other diseases."
2,"The New Arthritis Breakthrough: The Only Medical Therapy Clinically Proven to Produce Long-term Improvement and Remission of RA,","I think the book's claims are over stated and while it may work on select people it is not the cure all. Based on my on observations I have proven some foods trigger arthritis attacks on me and I don't think any medicine would prevent the attacks. I have improved my join pain by changing the way I eat and drink. I think the author of ""How To Eat Away Arthritis"" is a better guide for arthritis suffers. Some people may need additional help but cleaning out your body and changing the food you eat will give you results quickly."
4,Hard to believe a book could change my life,"I read the book in 1998 after suffering for 3 years with Rheumatoid arthritis. My doctors told me I wasn't bad enough to try any of the new drugs so I battled with extreme fatigue and joint pain with over-the-counter pain medication. I found the book to be repetitive in it's explanations of the disease. However, the testimonials of the suffers of the various diseases had me in tears. I convinced my MD to try the antibiotic therapy and after 3 months saw dramatic improvements. I was back to excercising and living a normal life! I recommend the book to everyone I know that is suffering from connective tissue disease."
5,This could be a miracle,"It seems to be the case that practical medicine takes a long time to catch up with medical research. The author presents what appears to be compelling evidence that a bacteria causes rheumatoid diseases, and that they can be treated with antibiotics. Dr. Brown, who pioneered this work, died nearly ten years ago, but his co-author has elected to continue the fight to get this information to the public. The book does a good job of explaining the theory, the treatment, and how a number of patients responded to it. I think this medical discovery could be a on a par with the discovery that H. pylori bacteria cause the vast majority of ulcers....no one believed it, but it turns out it's true. If you or someone you love has rhuematoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, or even lupus, you owe it to yourself to consider the information presented here. The science is strong, the treatment appears to be low risk, and the success rate is high."
2,very involved book,I bought this book for 2 people i know who have RA. I don't think either of them read it. You really have to be ready to think outside the traditional medical box to get this book. It was originally recommended to me by someone with RA who read it and is doing the treatments and is living a wonderful life because of it. She said it saved her life. I think it's worth knowing this information.
5,It didn't work for me.,"While I believe that this is effective for the many RA sufferers whose illness is caused by a bacteria, mine appears to be caused by a virus. I tried the cure for 4 months, along with Cipro, a strong antibiotic. While many using the method w/my doctor got better, I and a few others saw no improvement whatsoever."
4,Fun Read with Great Characters,I enjoyed this book immensely. It grabbed my attention early on and held it through the whole book. Derek Chase could be the next 'Alex Cross' character for the years to come. The story is written in such a way that you feel like you know the characters and are there with them in the room. I would highly recommend this book for those of you who are looking for a fun and intriguing read by a great new talented author. I can't wait to follow Derek Chase on his next adventure and see if he resolves things in his personal life.
3,buy the two b-sides off iTunes for much less,"""Funny Little Frog"" is a fantastic song (in my opinion), and the so-called hardcore Belle & Sebsatian fans will need the single to round out their collection, but everyone else should stay away. The price as of now is way too high for the two rather mediocre b-sides, and you can buy them for a dollar apiece on iTunes anyway.The musically lacking ""Meat and Potatoes"" has fantastic lyrics with many witty sexual puns and whatnot. ""I Took a Long Hard Look"" is a by-the-numbers Stevie tune, but one can imagine it benefiting from being placed somewhere on ""The Life Pursuit,"" had Stuart stuck to his original idea of having a double album."
3,Cheap but...,"It's a good price for a decent size TV, but I really wouldn't advise anyone to get a television that comes with no Audio/Visual inputs. It's really limiting. I have a Hi-Fi Stereo VCR I can't enjoy because my television doesn't support that.The sound isn't that great. My TV has a high pitched hum for 2 minutes everytime you first turn it on. That's not cool.The picture is ok. But w/ all the flat screen TV's it's just mediocre.Yeah so if you're the type who wants top of the line pictures and sound, keep shopping. If you just want a big, cheap, decent TV, get it..."
5,"RCA 36"" HD Monitor","Outstanding! It is everything that the manufacturer say's it is. I would recommend this above the 38"" RCA HD which is about 2 stars in my estimation. I had a difficult time picking this set above a projection type TV but am sure glad I did. My only problem was with it's weight but there is nothing you can do about that. I sit about 6 feet away from the TV and can see no trace of ""lines"" when watching regular TV."
2,PDF plus Test Engine,"I've taken other CBTs from Cisco, mostly on the web. Those were usually Powerpoint presentations with audio. I was very disappointed with this training.The ""CBT"" is actually just a PDF that has been indexed by the menu-driven ""study engine"". Except that the PDF was written exclusively from the study engine. This is evident when you start with Chapter 1 and it takes you to page 53 in the PDF. Immediately, the PDF starts referencing material covered in the earlier pages (which you haven't read yet).Like the other reviewer, I printed out the PDF on a duplexing printer (377 pages on 188 pieces of paper) and am reading the PDF in sequential page order.THE GOOD: The test engine is very good and will allow me to ""familiarlize"" myself with the type of questions I might get on the test."
1,"Terrible, book needs proof reading badly","This book is very difficult to follow. Topics are not presented in a way that promotes learning, full of lists of ill referenced tables and facts, abundant use of acronyms without definition. Many review questions referencing terms not presented. Typos abound, is it RTCP or RCTP? You've got me. A struggle at every turn of the page. Decidedly NOT recommended."
5,Very strong caffienated gum!,"The cinnamon taste is very strong and very good tasting. Definitely get a quick and noticeable energy boost from this gum. You're only supposed to chew the gum for 5 minutes then remove it (per instructions). And that's about all needed for it to help you wake up. If you're sensitive to espresso, coffee, or other minor stimulants then you might find it a bit much I could imagine.I usually carry this in my car and briefcase, just in case I start getting tired at a bad time. Significantly more convenient then an energy drink or 5hr energy, IMO. And it works just as good!Per the packaging it says it has 5pc per pouch, however I've opened 4 pouches so far and they all had 6pc! Maybe I just got lucky in some manufacturing flaw, but I'm not complaining!Definitely worth a shot if you travel a lot and you depend on 5hr energy or other supplements to give you a little pick up when you need it most."
4,An Effective Product,This gum besides being good tasting and having a flavor that lasts a surprisingly long time does what it promises. It keeps you alert. I am a person suffering from a variety of chronic illnesses including chronic fatigue. This gum helps me a great deal.
5,Caffeine quick 100mg,"This is a product of your taxes at work. The Army spent a lot off money developing a method to keep our troops extra alert for extended periods of time while not injuring them. They discovered the quickest way to deliver caffene is to chew it not swallow and dijest though you can just swallow it . The product works fastest when chewed . This is stronger than JOLT(40mg) gum and faster working , having 100mg of caffeine per piece. One piece works for me about the same a three pieces of JOLT gum (a good product that tastes better). If you need caffeine this is a great and convenient delivery system. Keep in your auto/truck for when you get sleepy behind the wheel , this stuff really works . I am a big guy and it has never taken more than two pieces to fully wake me up . For when you didn't get enough sleep the night before the test. Not for kids under 18. If caffeine makes you jittery don't use this product."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I read the other reviews, and thought this would be the perfect item to give me that much needed caffeine boost. I drive a semi-truck over the road, and wanted something that would substitute for coffee, since too many bathroom breaks slow me down. I will be going back to the coffee. Besides not working as advertised, they taste terrible."
1,Worst tasting gum ever...,"STAY ALERT Military Caffeine Energy Gum - Six Pack (6 packs, 5 pieces per pack) Cinnamon Flavor - 100 mg Caffeine per pieceThis has to be by far one of the WORST tasting caffeine gums out there. I have been chewing caffeine gums, taking caffeine mints, drinking caffeinated water for years now. Mad Croc is also pretty bad, the sick bitter taste this gum has, is alot like chewing a no doze tablet. Its just crap and I cannot believe people reviewed it and said it tasted good. Its just awful, seriously.. Jolt is alot better, Mad Croc is equally awful tasting though.. If your looking for a flavor, look elsewhere, this just taste like chewing an aspirin... TERRIBLE..."
4,"Works, but be cautious!","This gum has 100mg of caffeine in it, which is approximately equivalent to one cup of brewed coffee. However, it works MUCH faster.Being a college student, I'm often up very late (either for studying or for more fun activities) and have to get up very early, so this has been a lifesaver when I'm about to fall asleep during a test or important lecture.Be sure, though, that you follow the directions EXACTLY. You're to chew ONE piece for FIVE MINUTES. The first time I used it I'd already had a few cups of coffee in the morning and I popped two pieces in my mouth. Unfortunately, I started shaking and my hands were twitching for more than an hour. It wasn't scary (actually, a rather amusing experience) but if you need to be at work or driving, BE CAREFUL."
5,good gum,"I wouldn't chew it over regular gum. the texture is lost after 10 minutes. but thats not its purpose. the purpose is to give you alertness quickly. and it does just that. As a dental student, I study for hours on end. Often I feel drowsy sitting in front of a computer. I'll pop one of these guys, and it gives me a nice jerk. Will keep purchasing until school is over."
2,"Terrible taste, good caffeine count but no other energy boost","The good:1) I like the packaging2) Cinnamon flavor3) Huge caffeine count compared to competitorsThe bad:1) Flavor is disgusting after 3 minutes of chewing -- bitter caffeine taste2) Much more expensive than competitors3) No taurine, ginseng, or anything else usually in the ""energy blend"" of drinks or competitor gums"

3,"It probably works, but tastes terrible","I love cinnamon gum, and I'm always up for a caffeine jolt. However, the after taste of this gum is pretty bad, actually real bad. If I had no other caffeine choices I probably would have sucked it up and continued chewing the gum, but as it is, most of the gum sits in a box to be used if I can't find any kind of cinnamon gum nor another other source of caffeine. If I were out camping or someplace where I couldn't buy or make a coffee, this would get more use from me"
5,Thanks Meryl! Another great read!,"After reading Thunder Island last December, I have been anxiously awaiting Brody's story. I wasn't disappointed. First of all I loved the setting, wine country in California. It's at the top of my list on places to visit. I was interested in reading about riddling the wine bottles - I had never heard of that. Second,while I guessed a few things I was equally surprised by others. Brody's character wasn't as dark and complex as some of her previous characters. He came across as a real person as did Tori. Their conversations were realistic as was their humor - especially with the unexpected tour bus. While this is not my favorite of her books, (Unforgettable and Half Moon Bay) I truly enjoyed it. I have a feeling we will be visiting wine country again? Hint, hint."
1,This book reads like a bad soap opera,"Meryl Sawyer somehow managed to squeeze every cheesy soap opera story line into one book. Identical twins, separated at birth. One raised in the lap of luxury, the other in poverty. These handsome rogues are reunited over the mysterious death of their father, an influential business man. Then there is a beautiful blond woman who is torn between the two, engaged to one twin, but in love with the other. And don't forget several near death experiences, and a large, inbred, dynastic family. Give me a break! Coupled with the slow, lack-luster dialog, shallow characters, and the requisite ""top secret government agent"" who goes around announcing to everyone he meets that he is a Navy SEAL, this book makes for a tedious and overly dramatic read. This was my first Meryl sawyer book and definitely my last."
5,Meryl Sawyer Is A Keeper!,"I borrowed this book from a friend who went on and on about how good the book was. I'm pretty picky about the authors I read, and usually stick with the same ones. I must say that Meryl Sawyer has just joined my list of favorites. Trust No One focuses on two twins separated at birth, both have no clue of the other. One of the twins, Brody, is a Navy Seal. The other, Elliott, runs the fathers winery business. Both are brought together when their father dies, which looks as if it was no accident, but murder. Brody and Elliott connect as they try to find who is making trouble for the family. In the meantime they have problems of their own when both realize they are in love with the same women, Tori, who Elliott is engaged to marry. Trust No One is full of suspense and plenty of surprises, and will keep you intrigued till the very last page!"
5,A great find!,I thought that this book was out of print and found it through one of Amazon's sellers. My husband is an historical re-enacter and portrays the main character in this book. He received it as a Christmas gift and finished it the day after Christmas. He loved it.
5,Wilsonart floor cleaning,"What a difference using this product has made on my Wilsonart laminate floor! I had been using a quick mop system, but the floor always looked dull and faded. Now it looks like new."
2,Very disappointed,"I was generous in giving this book 2 stars.ITs like the Cliff Note version of all the titles in the book.I did question buying it based on the number of pages.The last 2 chapters for me were the best.one star for each.I already new most of this info,a lot of the book is nothing more than the author's opinion.And when quoting the bible on ufo encounters..he does not even include the chapter of the old testiment that has the most ufo or strange encounters..The Book Of Daniel.....B.W."
2,Drys out scalp,"I have been using this product for about six months to give it time to do what it says, but unfortunately it didn't. I have relaxed hair and this product dried out my scalp. To each is own though!"
4,My Chihuahua's like this prioduct.,"This is a good, and , easy worming product. The dogs will clean it up all by itself. And, it seems to be effective."
2,The selections in this book miss the point completely,"Althought the editor has done a fine job of selecting sections of prose writing, he has failed to include anything that may give a glimpse into the thoughts and contemplations of John Ruskin. The overall effect is that of a politically correct tippy-toe around beautifully written passages that, in light of Ruskin's depth, say nothing at all and would thouroughly have disipointed Ruskin himself."
5,First Book I read on 9/11,As soon as this book became available in English I read it and I highly recommend it if you want answers like I did.
1,Uhhh....I think I know what this guy's been smoking!,"WHAT? Give me a break! To even suggest that the US was behind the biggest tragedy many of us have ever seen is absurd. I find it hard to even comprehend where the author collected his turdbucket of information. It's almost as stupid as a Jordanian taxi driver once claimed to me during the summer of 2002, ""Israel was behind 9/11. You will see!"" Yeah...what would Israel have to gain? What would the US have to gain by beating the hell out of itself? That suggests we made attacks on ourselves to pin the blame on Arabs and wage a war. Whether you think the war in Iraq OR Afghanistan is worthwhile or not, if you have one iota of common sense you'd know that this book makes NO sense. Utter crap."
2,More a travel video,Although it is named The Great American Train Ride it should be called a visit to Americas Cities. More time is spent exploring numerous stops along the way than is spent showing train travel across the US.
3,Great Trans American Train Ride,Too much time visiting cities. I wanted to see more of the beautiful country.
3,Great video but spends too little time with the train trip,"This video does pretty well with the video scenes from the train itself,but I feel a bit too much attention given to cities along the route much alike to a travel video.The train scenes given are very nice when they are back on subject however. For a train buff,its still a worthy purchase."
2,"Old stock footage, more cities than trains","The production cost of this movie must have been near zero. It appears to be mostly stock footage from the 70s or 80s. Modern narration, but everything shown appears very dated. I bought it because I wanted to see the Amtrak trains. It is probably 80% cities, 20% trains. This would be nice for instructional use, but in terms of home entertainment it's a real bore."
3,"Good image quality, but not so quiet.","I feel that I don't have to review the image quality anymore. As there are more professional reviews and users have already done.However, I'd like to generally state 2 points here.1.) The focusing is slower and noisier than the Micro 4/3 version. The turning sound is actually not very smooth, and louder than some of the Nikon and Canon USM lens.2.) For the image quality/price/size/sound factors, I don't think it is worth even at $900, not to mention the original MSRP ."
1,DOES NOT FIT ON MY GH2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was really excited about trying out this lensExcitement lasted about the time it took me to open packageDoes not even come close to fitting on my GH2How silly of me to think a LUMIX lens would fit on a LUMIX camera
3,Some sort of video...,This video is Ok to provide the general overview of the subject. Some people agree some disagree... I give it 3 stars because I was hoping it will explain the methodology so I could evaluate it myself. Instead it is overview of different opinions.
5,General Anthony Wayne,"I think that Anthony Wayne has been overlooked in American History. He was the first General of the Army of the United States. (George Washington was the Commander in Chief of the Continental Army and that is different). General Wayne deversed to be up there with Washington, Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Grant, Miles, George Crook, for it was General Wayne that brought the Indian uprising in the Northwest Territoy to an end with his victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, and he did his part in winning the independence of America from England during the Revolutionary War."
1,Beware the SVGA input!,"After much hassle, finally got this TV today. Looked great for about an hour, then I tested the VGA input. Apparently, this set absolutely cannot handle anything over 800x600 without damage. It does state that the maximum resolution of the set is 800x600 in the manual...."
1,Don't buy it.,It stopped working after only 15 months of use. It was turned off one night and won't turn back on. However it does emit a high pitched whistle if it's plugged in. No one from RCA will stand behind their product.
3,Complete Nirvana,"Although you can get twice as many stories in the new complete edition, this small paperback is perfect for people who don't want to commit to a hard-cover, or to 300+ pages of a Hemingway novel, or to long chapters. The few 4+ page short stories I read in this collection let me glimpse Hemingway's genius and still have more and want more. There is a nice, short preface to these stories written by EH."
5,Birthday Party Gives Birth to These Immortal Souls,"I haven't seen any mention of how ""Marry Me, Lie Lie"" has Rowland S. Howard on vocals nor any mention of how that track became the birth of These Immortal Souls. I shiver..."
4,"As An Acoustic Player, It Is Awsome","This album is pretty amazing, I have always been a fan of acoustic songs played by bands. I think it is awsome that they put all the good bands onto one album, none of the songs on hereare bad or boring. The best songs are Cute Without the E, Over it, Letters to You, and the Thrice one. If you'r in the mood for some quiet punk rock, you cant go wrong with this one."
4,AWESOME,"Wowsers!!! I though I loved ""Punk Goes Pop,"" but this album is a million times better ... maybe it's because the bands aren't covering bubblegum!!! My favorite tracks on albums have always been the acoustic and heart-driven ones so this compilation DEFINITELY rocks my world!!! I was especially excited to hear Yellowcard's ""Firewater"" (since it's not on any of their albums) and I'm a diehard YC fan!!! Thrice does an awesome job on ""Trust"" too. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves punk and acoustic sets!!!"
2,Not as hardcore as it should/could be.,"Being a huge Gatecrasher and Cream fan for quite some time, I was excited about this new release. Well after alot of anticipation for it's arrival, I am a little disappointed. It really doesn't have the hardcore feel of previous releases. It isn't bad....but it it isn't great. It is not because of the choice of tracks that is to blame, just the choice of remixes. Many friends have listened to this compilation also, and share similar opinions. Want something better? Choose an Gatecrasher compilation from 2002 - 2005....You'll Love it!"
5,"Great product, great price","I own several concealment holsters from various manufacturers but this is the first holster made by Glock that I've purchased. While a Glock 20 is not usually considered a CC handgun, this holster is the most versatile OWB holster I have found for CC. It is very plain and simple in design, but it does a great job of concealment (holds very close to your body). It holds the handgun securely and allows you to draw it quickly and effortlessly. Amazon had a good price and w/Prime it definitely was a great buy - 2 days free shipping. Without a doubt, the best CC holster, for the money, that I have found."
2,disappointing accessories,"I too made a mistake in buying this because of the fact that it DOES NOT INCLUDE AN A/C power cord. The thing takes 6 AA batteries. Where do you go buy 6AA batteries on Christmas night?I also ordered the recommended stand. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I cannot get this stand to fit into the little ""stand grooves"" on the base of the keyboard. The keyboard does not fit snugly onto the stand as a result. You can still use it, but don't bump into it or the keyboard will fall.The keyboard has a nice sound and we are having fun playing with it but I wish I'd gotten the one at Target that has light up keys to facilitate teaching the 9-year old I bought it for."
1,NO AC ADAPTER,AHh!!! I wanted it right away and paid $50 for next day shipping. When I got it I realized that it had no AC adapter! The other listing for 99.99 has an adapter. Now I have to pay an extra $10 for an adapter. So in total I spent an extra $35 for the same item that is available on Amazon!
1,No AC-DC Adapter & Power Cord,"I was outraged to discover that there was no ac-dc adapter & power cord with the Yamaha TPT-200 Keyboard. No adapter and no batteries. My grandaughter gleefully opened her Christmas present on Christmas day, only to discover we had no way to power it up. SHE WAS DISSAPPOINTED!! How could Amazon allow that to happen? And Yamaha, talk about poor, poor marketing. The marketeerr who thought up that moneysaving idea, surely must be a mental midget! No more Yamaha products for me."
1,Very disappointed,I guess we were all tricked on Christmas. This is shameful. I too bought this thinking it had the adapter which it did not. The adapter was the reason I got it from Amazon in the first place. When I emailed amazon they told me to contact the manufacturer which ofcourse you cannot. The stand that is advertised here is not the one that goes with it. We tried putting it together only to find out that the parts were defective and the screws did not go in properly so we returned it. Amazon sent us a new one very promptly which we appreciated but nevertheless it is the wrong stand. The piano itself sounds good and my son likes it but I also should of brought the one at Target which was the same price and lights up and makes it easier for children to learn. My son really wants a stand so we kept it but never again will I buy Yamaha merchandize again. Very disappointed!
4,Book for scotch lovers,"This book was a gift for my father in law, and he loved it. The only problem was how it was organized. We would have like to have seen an index on flavors (ie: if you're looking for something peaty, these are the scotches you would like)."
4,Good library referrance,"This is the most recently published compendium from Michael Jackson on the single malts available in the marketplace. Though the author died before the work was finished, a team of friends, all experts in the field, finished the book, so that it could be published. It's a good resource to place alongside other compendiums that you may have in your library."
4,Informative,We had an earlier edition of this great guide. Fun for tasting parties esp. when everyone brings a different bottle to try.
3,"Ok, not great","The whisky reviews are pretty brief, and the introduction on each distillery tends more towards an anecdote than describing the workings or idiosyncrasies of that distillery.For example, the editors are more interested in describing that the distillery changed hands 4 times over the last 40 years and was once owned by a champion poodle breeder, (irrelevant) and omit talking about how the bottling of a particular brand has shifted to using Glasgow water instead of local water, which has affected the taste of batches released in the last 5 years..."
5,"great book, nice remake of 5th edition","i have the fifth edition, this one completes the vision of Jackson. must have for the whisky enthusiast. nice to use for tastings."
4,Great for a plane!,"These stickers ""stick"" enough to stay, but come off when you need to re-use them. My daughter loved putting the stickers in the ""right place"" but also had fun just putting her favorites on her body or the back of the plane seat.My 21 month old LOVES stickers but is just starting to ""get"" numbers and the alphabet, so it was nice to have a book that could be educational or not, depending on her mood.The only weird issue is that she knows her capital letters better than her lower-case ones, so she was frustrated with the letters. They provide the lower-case, and she wanted the upper-case."
5,Cute animals,This had very cute realistic animals that weren't just the ordinary ones. It is easy to use and just right for about a 3 year old.
4,good,Liked the matching of the stickers to the picture in the book. Children who like stickers should like it a lot.
5,great learning tool!,"My daughter is 2 and a half and very resistant to learning her letters from mommy. I have to be very creative to get her to do things without realizing she is actually learning something. This sticker book hit the mark completely! We did it for half an hour today and she really enjoyed herself!I wish I had found this earlier- I've been banging my head against a wall for quite awhile with this one.As to the other review- our stickers stuck on great with no problems, so I don't know if maybe that one was defective or something."
4,Great Buy!,"If you have have young children who are just learning to say their first words, this would be a great sticker book to have them learn either their first words or their ABC's this would be agreat book for your children. This book has every first word that are easy for your child to say and learn. I recommend this to anyone who has a young child learning how to either say their first words or how to learn their ABC's. It's like a portion of Pre-School right in this one sticker book. And one more great sticker book is My Big book Of Stickers."
4,Granddaughter favorite,"A fun activity book on which my two and five year old granddaughters worked together naming pictures, matchingpicture to shapes, finding stickers and putting them on. It also provided alphabet recognition practice.The girls had lots of fun working on it together.One improvement would be to have perforated sticker sheets that could be removed for use more easily.I would buy a similar product again.Michigan Grandma"
3,A no-decision,"This is Ravi Coltrane's third disc as a leader; the good news is that his tenor playing continues to grow in authority, & that he's worked out his own intelligent take on the M-BASE style of smart, off-kilter rhythms (cf. Coleman, Osby &c). & yet I find the album hard to like. Part of the problem is the loud, gut-punching studio sound which makes the hyperkinetic rhythms (especially Steve Hass's busy drumming) lash out at you mercilessly. The other problem is that sometimes the decision to use familiar postbop standards for the majority of tracks seems perverse: I mean, do we really need ""Round Midnight"" to be mauled virtually to the point of unrecognizability? -- Anyway, Ravi Coltrane himself remains the most likeable presence on the album, & ensures that it remains listenable. Fans of this kind of in-yer-face contemporary jazz will find much to enjoy; others should approach with caution."
4,Haunted Memories,"Haunted Memories deals with the problem and results of childhood abuse, of which the author has firsthand experience. His training and work in Christian counseling enable him to present the subject with both psychological and spiritual insight, and offer guidance and hope to those in need. His careful description of the immediate and adulthood symptoms might lead one to conclude that everyone has at least some of these. However the author points out the differences between such general indications and the true warning signs of abuse."
4,KAPLAN MCAT PREMIER BOOK 2008,"I bought this book even though I will not be taking the MCAT for some time. However, I am using it as a study aid for my current coursework until then. It's very helpful and has great tips about HOW to take the MCAT not just what is on it. To all who are taking the test-- GOOD LUCK :0)"
1,Stay away from Kaplan,Just a regurgitation of any science textbook. Go with EK if you want more for your buck.
3,Decent.,"I liked the CD version and ability to take questions on my computer. The exam is, after all, computer based."
4,Good value for your money,"The Kaplan MCAT review series with CD gives me a better understanding on what I should be concentrating on whem preparing for the MCAT exam.Overall, this is good value for your money."
4,I used this book for a film class,"I was required to purchase this book for a college course. I am not the type of person that would usually pick up a book like this, however I found it helpful when studying Italian film."
4,Take a Hard Ride,One of my favorite western movies. I have always liked Jim Brown's westerns. He was in great form in this one. Lee Van Clief was great as the bounty hunter. The surprise was Jim Kelly. Some of his best martial arts fight scenes are on this movie. This is the type on movie I can watch over and over again.
3,"A modern take on ""Its a Wonderfull Life""...","Though not anywhere near as good or as affective.The story is a little different, but much the same. Richie Rich wishes that he was never born and it comes true, not by an angel though, but by a wish machine. And then realizes how wonderfull life reall is... Also things that make this movie not so good is the fact that it has cheezy dialogue(even for a G rating, they could have got better dialogue),bad effects,and a mediocre take on ""Its a Wonderfull Life"" chances are children will like this playfull romp. If they can't sit through and appreciate ""Its a wonderfull Life"" maybe they'll appreciate this, even if you can't.God Bless ~Amy"
3,entertaining kids story,"not a film that will win any awards for outstanding performances or story-lines, but it is entertaining. My kids really enjoy it though and it is a good family film in that there is no violence, swearing, etc. This is a film that kids of any age could watch or a family could enjoy together."
2,this was a waste of time & money,"there was really no point to it, it was so weak in story line & the actors were all second rate, oh, what a waste of money& where was macaulay caulkin he made all of the home alone films great, this other little boy was a b actor that i would have rated an F!"
2,Don't Make Time For This.,"In December, I am a pushover for movies that have something to do with Christmas. I am sad to say that this was almost a complete waste of time. The plot is to old, and the story is quite thin. The ending does not even carry much weight. The only thing that saves this from being a complete disaster is that there are some comical moments, as well as some interesting interaction amongst the characters. Don't cut into your Christmas Preperation time for this one."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"I have everything from the set not coming on,to high pitch pinging on this set.It's 2yrs old and not one person I've talked to,(repair Technician) has given me any good reviews on RCA. Dependebility is ""0"". Craftsmanship, I'm told has alot to do with it! Iwould definitely try another Brand!"
3,Sorry Earth,"First of all I just want to give kudos' to ViewSonics engineers. How they tap directly into the sun to power this baby is truly a work of genius.I was a little skeptical at first on how this thing would perform. However, when I installed and run the Seti@home program it started instantly finding alien signals, which where corrected, cleaned up and translated.I am now listening and talking to the supreme galactic defense minister about Earths surrender. Apparently this computer is not only tapping into the sun for power but also into the mysterious dark energy and tearing the universe apart. Just comes to show how bugs always show up in technology when you least expect it."
5,Very Good,"I received this item, and was very pleased with it. It is made well, sturdy, and looks nice on my desk at work. Great buy!"
1,"Good product, Customer service stinks","Product is great, company that I purchased it from is not!( I currently can not use the stand, it sits in a box in the closet ) The company is not very helpful and does not seem to care about their customers."
1,Discusting,"I've read the french translation of this book, and boy, was I sorry I even set my eyes on this book! I bought this book on inpulse. The french version book cover reads: ""Make the woman of your life, the mistress of your dreams"". After reading this book I must say that both these titles are false. For the most part, this book talks on how to ""hook"" the woman you desire (i.e. make her love you). But in some parts, the author appeals towards a married man. So to whom is this book intended? And for those of you whom are interested by the english title, do some math: for the 200+ pages in this book, about 50 --to be generous-- deal about the beedroom. My best bet: Dr. Barbara Keesling. Check out ISDN 0-06-109346. Do a loop in your thinking"
1,Very dissappointed,"Not worth the paper it is written on. It is more of a beginners guide to dating than anything else. HELLO! If we want to drive our women wild in bed, we are a little past that.It dedicates a whole chapter to condoms. Granted condoms are important and should be worn. But I was looking for a book that both partners have known each other for a long time, where their is a trust, and a friendship. This wasn't it.Except for maybe two chapters, and that is pushing it, the book is a waste. I am extremely disappointed, don't recommend it to anyone."
3,Not what you expect.....,This book has a few things to try but nothing in relation to the title. To sum it up there are dating tricks and a few sex techniques. This book could have been sumarized in twenty pages. However it was written well and the points that it does make are very good. I can see from a mans perspective that this book may seem useless. However there are little points here and there that explain a woman that can be used as sexual techniques.
1,Lame and misleading,"I agree with the other reviewers who state that this is NOT a book on sexual techniques for men to learn for their women, but rather mostly a guide on dating - and not a very good one, at that. It's full of PC feminist advice on dating that is tangential, at best, to the title of the book. If you're already in a sexual relationship with a woman, you'll learn very little about sex you don't already know. Even if you aren't, there are better guides on dating than this one.If you want a book that actually teaches you something about driving women wild in bed, get Lou Paget's How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure or Susan Crain Bakos' Sexational Secrets, which really deliver the goods this one promises."
2,Yawn!,I had heard good things about this book a while back but I was severely disappointed. The book was a bit shallow. I enjoyed some of the tips on dating.A far better book is THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE by Michael Webb and also HOW TO GIVE HER PLEASURE by Lou Paget
5,Excellent book on a touchy-topic,"After being with my husband for going on 6 years (almost 2 married), I would call our sexual encounters boring and almost always non-orgasmic for me. The book made him realize that he needs to try some new ways and understand a woman's needs, not just his own. It touches on every aspect of sexual behavior and leaves you to decide what you want to do with it. Thank You!"
1,Deceiving title leads one to think written for men-not at a,"This book was purchased as an informative ""gift"" for a man. Little did I know that the book isn't about how to drive your woman wild in bed at all but how to get a woman's attention and what to do with her if one does. This book was obviously written by a woman for women. If I were a man, this book would probably hit the rim of the trash can after I skimmed through the first four chapters and hit chapter five where the reader is served a juvenile ""Dear Staci"", question and answer period. Pardon me, but if a fellow can't even speak when a girl he ""really likes"" comes around he hasn't even come close to the ""driving her wild"" stage. This book will be most useful to adolescent boys who find it hidden in their mothers' nightstands."
3,Average,"Be in no doubt Abdullah Ibrahim is a very important African musician, whose mix of Jazz and African music is really amazing, and if you haven't heard his music I strongly recommend it (try 'Blues for a Hip King' on CD).Unfortunately this documentary does not spend enough time looking at the music and dwells on social and racial issues, which I concede were more important when the film was made in the 1980's. Nevertheless for reasons of quality and the lack of focus on music overall this was a bit of a disappointment."
3,very good book,"Hello i found this book very helpful it gives you and (idea) of everyday situations people go though, that may or maynot have access to orisha or a bawbalawo.Example work problems which orisha rules this and what prayers you might say to him or her, what types of foods to give and prayers. Please BUY this book as well as Dr Mauge's other books as part of your collection He was great teacher and person RIP"
4,Work in the 21st Century,"This provides an excellent introduction and discussion of the terms and issues industrial and organizational psychologists need to know today. This book also provides a nice foundation for the scientific research requirements behavioral psychologists should use and ought to have a firm grasp of. Readers will gain a basic understanding of the history and future of industrial and organizational psychology, as well as the practical issues of managing the workplace of today. There is an extensive glossary with meaningful terms to comprehend, and the references cited provide a well-fleshed-out foundation of pertinent issues and ofWork in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Industrial and Organizational Psychology, including essential ideas presented by the respected researchers and thinkers in this field of study."
4,Fast delivery,Fastest delivery I have ever had on an order. The only minor problem is the book was dented because the packaged got damaged. Suggest packaging product in a bigger box and not an envelope that is only as big as the product you are sending. Otherwise the book was as stated.
3,Nice break from the life of a singleton,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book, but I really enjoyed it! I thought the main character was absolutely hilarious, but it wasn't very comforting to know that a mother could be so unorganized and mentally disconnected from her family. A lot of the time, it seemed as though the daughter was raising herself! Maybe I just come from a sheltered life, but it was a little disturbing to see that."
2,Silly summer read,"I hate to be harsh, and I have never read anything else by this author, but I would not recommend this book to anyone. Halfway through I was wondering why I was reading it!It was a quick read for summertime around the pool. I didn't care for the plot and the fantasies were kind of confusing."
1,Waste of time,"I read this book on a plane. Blew through it with 2 hours left in my trip, and was very disappointed. The fantasies are boring, the plot convoluted, the main character completely unlikeable and the end unsatisfying. Don't waste your time with this one--go for something by Jennifer Crusie, who is quoted on the front cover and whose books are interesting and funny."
1,MM61110,"This product comes with great features, but the unit does not hold up with quality components. I purchased this TV in Nov 2001 and 3 weeks later the TV would shut off by itself. After a short period you could turn on again but the same problem would occur a few minutes later. After being in for warranty repair for seven weeks and several new parts the unit was declared unrepairable. Maybe I got a lemon but I would not recommend."
1,Paperweight,"My girlfriend bought this television in 2002. She moved in with me this year and we spent buckets getting it moved up flights of stairs. It worked fine with poor picture quality (everything looked dusty). I would press up on the remote and the sound would go down - this happened almost every time. Now the television will not power on. We came to find out when she left it with her mother that it had the same problem and then miraculously started working again.I will not buy another RCA product again, unless of course, I want another two hundred pound paper weight."
1,don't waste your time and money,I planted these seeds and never saw a seedling. I prepped the soil and watered the beds to no avail.
2,"Good Laptop, Horrible Heatsink","Let me start by saying this laptop is blazing fast. 10ghz cuts through processes like a hot knife through butter. And the 30 terabyte hard drive... I can fit the entire Library of Congress on this thing.There's just one shortfall with this laptop. The heatsink on this thing isn't adequate whatsoever. I set my laptop on the couch and it burned straight through to the floor. Advice to Viewsonic, look into a cryogenic coolant system for the 10gig processor. A cheap piece of aluminum and a fan just ain't gonna cut it."
5,"Run me over, why don't you?","There are some records - precious few - that you just know are going to amaze you from start to finish, and leave you quivering in their wake. A Life Less Plagued is one such record. From the first second I even laid eyes on the closed jewel case, I knew that it was going to be killer. And it was every bit. Every song, every second, is an explosion of energy that reaches out of your speakers and into your heart. Sappy? Maybe. True? Absolutely. If you like youth-crew, positive, old school hardcore, this'll be right up your alley. Fans of In My Eyes, Ten Yard Fight, Bane, and other revivalist bands, your collection is not complete without this. For those still new to the path of the hardcore, let this be your next stop. In a word: UPLIFTING."
2,Very unstable,The first one I bought four days ago kept resetting itself to 12:00 (like another customer reported) and goes into TV mode whenever it likes (just like the other customer said). I took it back and got a new one which started to do the very same thing after less than a day. I am taking it back and getting a different brand. I have wasted three days already. This is a [poo] remote control. I am warning you. Don't waste your time with this product!
1,It's not worth the money,"The toll-free helpline that RCA lists in it's instruction manual is totally useless. Instead of getting a live person, you're connected to a computer that spits out voice commands. The remote itself? It's not made that well. The battery case & it's cover did a poor job of keeping the batteries secure. Because of this, the time kept getting wiped out, and I was forced to reset the clock numerous times.In the end, this remote wasn't worth the money I spent on it. Avoid this one if you can."
2,Very disappointed with this,"I liked the layout of this remote, and with the learning capabilities, I figured that this would be ideal. However, I couldn't get it to ""learn"" a single command. It kept showing the ERROR sign. When I programmed my CD player with the only code that would work, only one function of that worked...and that was the wrong key! Needless to say, it got returned."
4,"Good remote, easy to use","After trying several LCD remotes I purchased this one and loved it. You can program several machines within one function key (you can switch satellite chanels plus change receiver volume without pressing different function keys in between. If you have direct TV with an RCA converter the remote is EXCELLENT. The macro buttons are a great help -- turn the tv,reciever,and satellite dish on and off by pressing just one button! Unless you've got a really complicated setup, this remote should suit your needs -- (...)"
3,Works fine but construction is flimsy.,"Yeah, this adaptor worked just fine but it was poorly constructed and flimsy.REMEMBER, this is an adaptor NOT a converter despite appearances to the contrary. An adaptor merely adapts US male plugs to fit their European or Asian female wall socket counterparts. You will still have a 220 V power source. A converter transforms the 220 V from Europe to the 110 commonly found in the USA. You will also need to pay close attention to the wattage of the converter. A converter that will run your wife's hairdryer will not necessarily work on devices requiring less wattage. Many, if not most, converters have switches to handle both load levels.Most computer and camera rechargers will work with a simple adaptor since they are designed to handle either 110 V or 220 V. You need only look at the label on your charger to determine what voltage it is designed for.I'm still looking for a well made solidly built adaptor."
1,Prefer some other make.,"the product is very useful and would have been great value for money had the finishing of the product be better. the adjustments are not at all smooth and it seems that, every time u change the setting, somethign or the other will break down int he adaptor.in brief, prefer some other make of this. not up to the mark of SAMSONITE name.disappointed."
3,"Good in a pinch, but doesn't fit into all spaces","The product was convenient during my trip to the UK and Europe, as I didn't have to get multiple adapters. It's relatively portable, which is a plus. As others have mentioned, when plugging your device in, it can feel like you're forcing it enough that you might break it, but in fact I never did actually break it, although some of the construction seems a little weak.BTW, make sure you know this is an adapter, not a converter. Make sure your devices are rated to run at all the required voltages, lest you get blowed up.The only problems I had with it were sometimes the UK sliders would need to be coerced a bit more forcefully than should be required in order to get the prongs out. (Make sure the prongs lock into place, or else they'll just be pushed back when you try to plug the adapter in.) The other problem was that the size of the adapter could be a problem when trying to plug into tight spots.All in all, it got me through my trip."
4,Good Product,"Its a very useful product...I bought it before 2 years, now more modern adapter must have come....anyway...its good product."
5,Hysterical -- and a Great Ego Boost!!!,"Okay -- so celebrities make millions and you don't? Well, this will even the score -- you're smarter than they are! At least that's how you'll feel after reading this. These movie stars, etc. have no idea how funny they sound... Especially loved the Tori Spelling quote (which I won't share!) A very funny book....and one that makes you wonder how these people can earn so much!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this book as a Christmas present for a friend thinking that I was getting him a great present. However, when I recieved the book, I opened it to see for myself how funny it really was. NOT FUNNY AT ALL! All this book consists of is mindless ramblings of celebrities and nothing at all even close to funny. I never ended up giving this to my friend because it was so lame. I showed the book to my Mom to see if maybe she knew someone who liked corny stuff... she told me she would never give that book to anyone. I am not the kind of person who is hard to entertain. Usually if a see a someone get kicked in the face on T.V., I'm laughing all day. I'm looking at the book now trying to find some ""fabulous"" quoteto share with you, but SURPRISE! There does not exist even ONE that is worthy. You can be sure that I'm sending this one back!"
4,"Descendants of Thomas Wellman of Lynn, Massachusetts",The book is well written informative. There are some pages missing or illegible. As an ancestor of Thomas Wellman I find the book a wonderful tool in my genealogy search and a facinating read.
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I was familiar with a few of Jimmie Dale Gilmore's songs and two were on this album. Then I learned to like another one or two. Otherwise the rest was pretty much nothing to write home about, but likeable."
1,Terrible buy the plants and forget the seeds,The seeds are a joke one or two sprouted the rest remain to be seen literally. Spend your money and time planting the pansy from the box store and get your monies worth. The time I wasted on these I could have spent planting the plants and had pansy growing everywhere by now! Boo on these seeds!
2,"Look for ex-Cheap Trickster Pete Comita (Bassist, 1980-mid '81) in an episode w/ band in Bowling Alley","Not really fan of Rosanne? Neither am I,although John Goodman is tolerable in smalldoses. Episode for 'Trickster fans to watchfor is the one where Dan tries to join a bandfronted by ex-Cheap Trick Bassist (in reallife) Pete Comita, who was in band back inthe '80's with mostly current CT bass playerThomas J. Petersson, who is problably CT's3rd best overall. You can say you've beenwarned!"
2,"""scrubs"" are related to columbine?","Okay, well, to each his own, I guess, but I think it's very unfair to consider this a tool of the Columbine massacre. How do you go from blaming Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Eminem (even if I don't like their music, it's rediculous to judge), and then go to TLC?In case you hadn't noticed, art imitates life just as much as life imitates art. Of course we are influenced by what we see. How can we not be? We have eyes. If you see a Burger King ad, you might want to go to Burger King. How does that send you into a crowded school with a gun?The song isn't extremely amazing. In fact, it's tired already, but to claim that this started one of the saddest days this year, no matter how indirectly, is just ludicris."
4,holds up well,My son has been using this glove for 5 years and it has kept its shape and can physically held up. The only problem is that he had to replace the laces. Overall great glove!
2,total hip hop bubblegum,I was shocked to hear he is related to an african music/jazz music legend. I would have expected something better than this. Mr Lonely is a cute unserious song with an awesome piano hook but the rest is bland crap
2,Um...,"You know, I first heard this album awhile ago, but after listening to it all the way through, I decided it was only okay. My least favorite song in Bananza. The reason is because it makes belly dancers all look like a bunch of strippers and sluts, which we're not. That song is very disrespectful. The rest are so-so, nothing great, nothing horrible. I recommend this to some people, who listen to whatever they can get their hands on, but if you want amazing music hip-hop or anything, this isn't it."
4,Diverse set of songs from Akon,I was impressed with the variation of the types of songs on this CD which ranged from down and dirty hip hop to almost pop like songs with Mr Lonely. Definitely a pleasant surprise
3,Just Getting Airplay,"I was listening to my radio one day and what I thought might have been a Wyclef song. But, it wasn't it was ""Lonely"" by Akon. As I am looking at this album listing for the date, I see that this album was made in the Summer of 2004. What is this song finally getting airplay and it is April 2005. The only bad thing about the song is it makes a oldie but goodie sound like Alvin, Simon, and Theodore were performing it."
2,Only good song on Album,"Only good song on Album ,that is lockup , the rest suck. Its gets 2 out of 5."
5,Akon is giving the charts trouble,"Akon is a sensational artist and his debut album Trouble is a perfect example of personal experiences. When the single ""Locked Up"" was out on the streets people played it everywhere. When ""Ghetto and Lonely"" came out and was played on the streets people i knew went and bought his album. Akon is one of my influences to make my music personal and about me."
2,Akon's Album is mediocre at best.,"Locked Up is the best song on this album. Akon has several songs that sound similar to Locked Up but they just do not have the same passion and effect. Belly Dancer is another nice song and so is Trouble. However, beyond these three songs this CD lacks appeal. Akon is talented and has a unique, velvety sounding voice. However, he needs not just good sounding songs, but good sounding sonds that complement his unique voice. And this CD lacks those. Nice first try. Better luck next time."
5,Hard to Soft and everything in between...,"Wow! I'm surprised this album only went gold, with a lil more publicity it would have went double platinum or more. Akon is what this industry needs rights now. He's thug, church, american, african and west indian all rapped up into this amazing album. 'Trouble' will touch any and everyone that's able to hear a melody and understand words. From the young to the old, weak to the strong, hurting to the healed--YOU CAN RELATE TO THIS ALBUM. Us Women can definitely relate..I feel like I know him personally. His whole vibe on this album and his bio makes him fit right at home. This album will make you laugh, cry, and move, but most of all it will make you think. If I could meet Aliaune ""Akon"" Thiam I'd bow to him, he's an inspiration to us in the ""GHETTO""...Shout out to Flatbush--We feeling AKON..."
3,Yea Yea....Standard Release,"Classic....no...bad...no...i guess i'm being lenient by juxtaposing this release to the million other sh!!tty releases that came out this year (Nelly neone)...but although this is not a ""COT D@MN THIS IS HOT"" release, it is one of the better albums of 2004.I wasn't compelled to buy this album when i heard the SUMMER SMASH HIT ""Locked Up."" I thought it was a decent song (a lot better than the other SUMMER SMASH HIT TS's ""Lean Back""). It wasn't until i heard the single GHETTO (or more accurately saw the very original and interesting video) that i decided to DOWNLOAD this album. And i'm glad i downloaded it.this is an average album not really worth MY 8 - 20 dollars (depending on the store). But if you do find it somewhere for 5 - 10 dollars, i wouldn't suppose it'd be a complete waste of money. Just don't expect to be listening to it 3 weeks from your purchase."
5,Da Boob,This is the best cd ever and if you dont have one you should get a few for you and your friends.
4,Very good CD from beginning to End,"I got this CD because of the track 'Locked Up' and after reading other reviews saying the CD was good. The CD is full of great R&B tracks like 'Journey', 'Trouble', and 'Lonely'. Definetly a must buy. There are no real explicit lyrics except on the rap track 'Gansta', which is the only rap only track on the CD."
3,Blowin Up,This guy has an incredible voice he really surprised me I wasn't expecting this c.d. to be bangin like this.Hip-Hop meets R&B once again but this time with a vengance.Go cop this disc!!!
5,Awesome!,"this CD has everything you would want on a music CD, plus new product. Personally, my fave track is Bananza (Belly Dancer). Very recommended!"
2,Not what I expected! POOR choice.,"I bought the video and was very disappointed. It is not at all what I expected and tries to present a clinical approach to very personalissues. Sorry, but there are FAR better choices so save your money."
3,Book,"The book is about 2.5"" X 3"", however it wasn't listed as a mini book.Love the story but needed a book I could read to a group of children.The pictures are too small for a group.Please note: I did not request problem solving. Service was very prompt, packaging was good,and the book arrived in new condition, as described.Without requesting it, the seller refunded the purchase price and shipping costs in full AND did not expect me to return the book. Thank you."
4,"laser printing yes, ink pens no","I would agree with most other posters about how tough this stuff is. It laser prints well. My only complaint is that it doesn't take ink pens well. It is very slippery to write on and medium ink pens register only a very thin line (if you can get the ball rolling at all). The ink from gel type pens never seems to dry and will smear big time, even after a several minutes. A sharpie is really your only alternative. Use this stuff for permanent finalized work."
4,It's Rat Fink. What more do you need to know?,"I've got several different Rat Fink guitar straps from Levy's Leathers. All are strong, well-designed, and just flat-out cool (it doesn't get cooler than ""Rat Fink""). The only gripe I have is that the Rat Fink images all face the same direction, so that if you have him upright on the strap behind your back, he'll be upside-down on the side from your shoulder to the guitar, and vice-versa. You just have to choose which way you want him to be upside-down. Still cool as heck, though."
5,Cover to Cover!,I would have to say that this textbook is very well written and is easy to follow. Schultzs made the book very interesting with great examples and photographs.
2,Theories of Personality W/Study Guide,"It is an old edition, not what I need for my class. and there was no study guide. I needed the 9th edition and it was the 6th edition"
4,Great item but a little late,"This was the exact book I needed for class and it was cheap but it took a long time to come. I needed it earlier in the semester. When it says up to 14 days, prepare yourself for 14 business days..."
2,Borderland,"The film is interesting and disturbing,The movie is loosely based on a Miami Born Psycho Path(Who was not Mexican By the way) who went to Mexico later on.. Anyhow As A Practicing Proud Catholic but who understands yet does not Follow ""Santeria""(which this is not by the way,it is a Cult,More closely of Paleros) the movie is grotesque and shocking and based indeed on true events why anyone would want to glorify it is beyond me, ""Inspired by True Events"" How can you be inspired by such garbage? That said the movie is not for the faint of heart and it doesn't mean you cannot watch the movie with a open mind,it is almost like A Mexican Saw but perhaps more gruesome. View at your Risk,something Different and scary cause it is real."
5,One of my favorite and most realistic of the Horrorfest Films,"Borderland is shockingly realistic in that these things really do happen in Mexico.The cast is great featuring Rider Strong who has become somewhat of a scream king in such movies as Tooth and Nail, Cabin Fever 1 and 2,Death Valley and Darkening Sky.This is much more than a slasher but there is a lot of slashing going on.It's an interesting action packed ride complete with heart pounding suspense.I loved Sean Astin as a red neck who guards the human sacrifice,he plays the dumb hillbilly to perfection.Again it is one of my favorite Horrorfest films and watch it quite often,it has great multiple watch appeal.There is a nice little love story weaved in and the ending was satisfying in my opinion as well."
5,Goat's Head Soup...,"This springbreak cautionary tale (based on an actual event), finds three Texas college guys (Brian Presley, Rider Strong, and Jake Muxworthy) on a pleasure-seeking trip to Mexico gone horribly wrong. The trio spend most of their time partying and tracking down hookers. All is well, until Phil (Strong) wanders off and disappears. Ed (Presley) and Henry (Muxworthy), aided by a beautiful barmaid and an ex-cop, attempt to find Phil, only to discover that a sinister, barbarous group of drug-dealers has taken their friend in order to perform a blood-ritual to appease their cultic gods! BORDERLAND is a well-made creeper w/ plenty of odeous bad'uns to hate. Sean Astin (LOTR) plays his psycho-americano Randall role in a subtle, frighteningly calm manner. The rest of the gang reminded me of the colombian killers in SCARFACE. If you enjoyed HOSTEL, FRONTIER(S), or WOLF CREEK, then BORDERLAND should be a gruesome treat..."
4,"Mexicans and human sacrificing, oh my!!!","This movie rocked! I loved the sheer insanity surrounding the plot. Any movie which includes gringos traversing throughout border towns, abusing Mexican law, and entertaining themselves via debauchery, drugs, and/or prostitutes definitely sparks my interest. This movie included all the aforementioned criteria. I just finished viewing this movie and I am nonetheless pleased =)"
1,horrible trash,"This movie won't help Mexico's tourism.. I wonder the purpose of this trash. Because this story is kinda true makes this even worse. I wasn't in the mood to witness 'Gringos' being hacked, dismembered to death by machetes. This movie wasn't so much poor rather the location. What a depressing and vile place Mexico can be at times with extreme racism toward whites. Weird drug lords, satanic sacrafical cults and a lot unclean living. I regretted renting this.. It is disgusting with no remorse or payoff. Just violent dribble.. AVOID!!"
2,Too many directions at once,"After borrowing a fried's alto sax and messing around for a bit, I rented a clarinet and got this book. I had never touched a clarinet before and was looking for a book to help me get started before I pursued lessons. I had piano lessons as a kid, so I can read music.This book rushes through fundamentals like assembling the instrument, cleaning it, holding it and blowing on it correctly. It provides a fingering chart without explanation--this took me hours to decipher. It offers a short history of the instruments and an introduction to musical notation. The bulk of the book is a survey of music history, touching on different classical composers and offering sample sheet music from each. The music selections are NOT for beginners.I honestly can't figure out whom this book is for. For teaching myself rudimentary clarinet-playing, I found some video tutorials on YouTube much more helpful."
4,Kathy's Aroma Oven Review,"My wife and I enjoy the Aroma Aeromatic Convection Oven. It cooks food well and is easy to clean. Our only disappointment is that we ordered the AST910DX and received the AST910 which includes the oven, tongs, low rack, and dual rack. The difference is that the DX model includes these extra items (lid holder, skewers, steamer rack, and breakfast cooker). I have attempted to obtain these items from the M.V. Trading Co. but without success."
3,timer and temperature numbers worn off :(,I've had this product for at least six years and used it frequently until the last year. The numbers have almost completely disappeared after wiping down the top. I even tried not to wipe it much when I saw it happening but it's almost impossible to use the oven now and remember where the dial needs to be for what temp or time. I wanted to ask the company if they had a template they could send me but they don't have the product any more.Would someone here be able to figure out how to make a template from their oven and send to me????
5,skankin jams,"This is a great album, it's got just the right mixes and tracks for anyone missing the islands to make there island parties in their own homes. It's great for dancing and rubbadubbin...your body will move to the first beat you hear, no joke...it's not too deep in story which is a good thing for those not looking for solitude...it's really a great album if you wanna party and dance...I was looking for a good album to add to my collection, and thank goodness I found a great one."
1,Poor Product,I've used Melatonin for years and think it's the best. I thought this would be even better....it's NOT. I would almost swear that it even kept me up at night!
3,Good Start to a Nights Sleep,"Due to menopausal symptoms, for past 5 months have had trouble going to sleep and staying asleep. Taking Shifts Melatonin Plus I fall asleep within a half hour of taking the tablet and sleep soundly for 1 hour. After that, I do wake up hourly, as I had before, but go back to sleep with less trouble. I have very vivid and sometimes very strange dreams when taking this drug. I do wake up slightly groggy but the grogginess goes away fairly quickly. I have only been taking Shiff's Melatonin Plus for about a week now. I will continue on and see what happens. It has worked better than any other over the counter remedy has yet."
4,Puts me to sleep,"My boyfriend suggested this product to me and on nights that I'm having trouble getting to sleep it puts me to sleep. The only problem I have is that I then need a full 8 hours of sleep or I wake up tired. This is fine when I don't have to wake up at a certain time the next day, but when I have been tossing and turning for an hour or two, after going to bed, I don't have 8 hours to sleep because I have to be up, and then I feel tired because I got up too soon. I don't like taking medication or pills, but this is natural so I feel better about taking it on those nights when I cannot seem to fall asleep. It really puts you to sleep, just make sure you have enough time to sleep after taking it. Hope this helps."
4,It works,I take it to help falling asleep and I think it works.I actually cut it in halves and take only half a pill sometimes.Usually after 30min-45min of taking it I'll feel very sleepy.
1,Restless sleep,"Well, researchers said that it should be tried for 3 days tell it gives a result. I have used it for the three days and then decided to quit. I had the worst sleep ever restless and irritable for the three days, I slept better before using it. I think it is not for me and you should consider that it might be not for you either."
1,No Help From This Product,Melatonin always works for me but for some odd reason this one would not. I chewed up two and there was no effect even later when I tried more at different times of the night other nights and still nothing. Even when I fell asleep I didn't sleep good as usual when I take my normal kind of melatonin in liquid form. I guess this works for some people given the reviews so odds are its gonna be this way for a lot of people where it works or it doesn't and not much in between. Melatonin is still great but I guess I will just stick with the liquid form. I have no idea why this kind would not work for me but it simply wouldn't so hence my rating.
2,Satisfaction gauge,"Product probably should be purchased in slow release form. Did not producequality or duration of sleep anticapated, however, I would choose it before Ambien."
3,"Didn't work for me, but works well for others","I personally have had problems with insomnia for a few months now, and before I could visit my physician and get a prescription for something stronger this helped me relax and get to bed sooner. My problem was that I was waking up in the middle of the night and my mind would race and I could not get back to sleep, and unfortunately this medicine did not help with that. It is a great value for the tablet count and I would recommend it to anyone having minor sleep problems related to stress, but if it lasts for an extended period of time something stronger prescribed by a doctor may be the route you may have to go as I did.Also, as opposed to other melatonin products, this one is a bit more bitter and not as sweet when they melt in your mouth. Not the worst taste ever, but bitter and not like candy."
4,Great Product for Price!,Really notice a difference and have come to enjoy one with breakfast each morning. Only difficulty is getting the vials open! I wish the company would change packaging to some sort of pop top!
3,THE WEDDING GIRL,This book was ok. It wasn't funny liked I had hoped. It was full of stress and turmoil. I really enjoy Sophie Kisella but have now read all of her books so I am stranded with Madeline W. The Wedding Girl would have been better if I had expected it to not be funny.
3,An okay read,It was an okay book. I felt that it was pretty predictable. Totally slow at the beginning. Towards the end of the book I was more into the book. But I believe that towards the end of the book the author just wanted to finish the book and wrap everything up perfectly and quickly (a little unrealistic if u ask me). I think she should have developed the characters a little further since I dont think that people just change their views on life or relationships so easily and quickly as they do in this book & everything's resolved. Overall it was an okay book. Some parts were entertaining and a little funny.
3,Not her best..,"I normally like her books, under this name and sophie kinsella. And while I know it is fiction, this one was just really reaching I guess. Not her best work.. Much prefer Cocktails for Three."
3,Enjoyed the Book Till the End...,"I picked up this book for a good ""chick lit"" read as I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's and Madeline Wickham's books, so I thought this one would be a good read. I enjoyed the book until the last quarter of it, where new plot lines were suddenly thrown in. The story line between Harry and Isobel is unnecessary and incomplete and Esme shouldn't be in the book at all (what was between her and Harry, it's never mentioned). I would recommend reading this book if you can borrow it from a friend but I would not pay full price for this book."
