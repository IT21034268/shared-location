4,Crush by Bon Jovi,"This is classic Bon Jovi. Sounds like Bon Jovi, feels like Bon Jovi and is enjoyable as Bon Jovi always is. I would recommend this album to friends & family too!"
5,Bon Jovi the best band,I think the album Crush is good and I hope that Bon Jovi keeps on making records as long as they can.
4,Crush!,"A great album although quite different from the others. They still keep that characteristic Bon Jovi style but with a kind of renovation, evolution. I'd like to thank the group for the bonus track that they offer us in the European album. Bon Jovi forever!"
5,they're back and ready!,This release shows why the guys have such a loyal following....great writing/playing and vocals throughout. They sound fresh and vital.....not a bad feat! TOUR?
5,Excellent cd...and the guys seem happy again.,"Well worth the wait, though I was dying for this release! Great rockers along with heartfelt ballads. A great effort from a great band!"
2,Ok for Pop fans,"If you liked the old Bon Jovi for their self titled and Slippery When Wet, then don't bother with this one. If you liked all the stuff after that this is probably great for you. Something magic about those first albums that can't be recreated. Beware."
3,Pretty Good Rock Album,"This is an ok album from BonJovi. It is also apparent that the band tries to hard to please the under 18 crowd with a non traditonal pop/rock sound on their first single ""It's my life"" which is more suited on a backstreet boy album. The rest of the songs are ok nothing that will break new ground but it is still ear candy for those die hard Bonjovi fans. Maybe on their next album they will spend a little less time watching the preteen Trl show and more time watching VH1."
3,Not original Bon Jovi Style,"As the title I mentioned, it is not the pure rock style. Again, sound quality is still not very well, and of course, this is style of Bon Jovi's albulm. Got to buy the remastering version when it comes out."
4,Not Bad...,"I bought this album because I was lured by its first single It's My Life which is great single.As an album as a whole let's say it is a bit above average in quality. It is true Thank You For Loving Me and Next 100 Years are killer tracks which will score more hits. Rest of the tracks might suggest Bon Jovi has become refined and matured. I had similar impression toward Euphoria but even losing their trademark roughness it was outstanding. Crush is not as impressive matured rock album than Euphoria. That is the reason because I gave them only four stars. I bought 12 albums so far this year. Bon Jovi's album is #9 among them, #7 in U.S. release."
2,a really big dissapointment for a really loyal fan,"sadly, for me and other BON JOVI fans, this cd wasn't what we expected. i have to admit that you can grow and mature as a band,but NOT at our expense! this is NOT ""THE"" BON JOVI album we needed to get. i expected somethig more like ""raise your hands"",""blood on blood"", ""living in sin"",""in these arms"",""i want you""....please boys, we, your fans know you can do waaaay better than this album. WE, your fans, are counting on it!"
1,Weak,Bon Jovi sound the same like at their very beginning. No step forward at all. And Jon's voice is just not very pleasant at all. A pain in the ear.
1,Rip Off Bon Jovi,"How does someone buy the original ""Its My Life"" by Bon Jovi?? This is some adaptation not the real thing. don't waste your money!"
3,Simple Review,"Highlights: Just Older (excellent song). Lowlights: Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars, She's a Mystery. The rest are just good songs. A little pop-ier than I like."
4,Pretty Good!,"This was the first Bon Jovi album I ever bought. I know what you're thinking, ""she's a Britney Spears fan, and just bought this because everybody else liked it"" well, (if that's what you're thinking...) I DO NOT like Britney Spears, and bought this album because I wanted to try some new music, and I really liked it! But, now that I've bought all the other Bon Jovi albums, I must say that this is one of my least favorites, but I still like it a lot! I'm really down with all of the 80's hits, and wish that they could write more songs like ""Bad Medicine"" and ""Lay Your Hands on Me"" (my 2 personal favorites). But all in all, this is a pretty great album."
1,are you kidding?,"I'm sorry but this has to be the worse excuse for a music CD....totally dissapointed at Bon Jovi. This CD has ONE song worthy of being called Bon Jovi style music, the others are something that should have stayed in the studio. An example, the last track on the CD, ""One Wild Night"" plays to the sound of the first track ""I'ts My Life"". Obviously just another ""Artist"" trying to hard to create a new beggining instead of going out in a bang (or style). What's wrong with the style he had in ""Young Guns II"" or ""New Jersey""....Oh well, another one bites the dust!"
3,"Some Grand Elements, But Not His Best.","I have heard all of Bon Jovi's records. The best way I can describe this is to compare it to Charles Dickens' ""Little Dorrit"" (1857). ""Little Dorrit"" was a late effort on Dickens' part. It had some grand elements, and there were interesting aspects of it, but it was too drawn out and did not flow well (in my opinion). To be sure, there are some wonderful songs on this album, but it does not carry the unity and intensity of earlier efforts like '7800,' 'Slippery When Wet,' or 'New Jersey.' It almost sounds like Bon Jovi had written a few good songs and had to find a way to fill up the record. To be sure, this record is worth listening to, but don't expect a masterpiece."
3,It's Okay For Those Hard Core Bon Jovi Fans!!,"It's Okay For the Hard-Core Bon Jovi Fans!!. Although I waited three Years To Get This Cd Because I Did'nt Have the Money To get it. It's Kind of a Dis-apointment. The Only Song I Like is ""It's My Life"". Anyways thats All"
1,Hair-banded together again.,"This CD serves as a reminder of Bon Jovi's limitations: good musicians with big hearts, and the collective imagination of a set of hubcaps."
1,Perfect Title,I Used To Like Bon Jovi abit back in the 80's.but as time has gone on the more by the numbers they have become.they haven't changed their style at all.it's very by the numbers Product.Nothing on Here Matches their GOlden Run.it doesn't matter what time period you come from Quality is Quality&this isn't it.
5,CRUSH - BON JOVI (Just Older),"This album is great! It has been a long wait, but it was worth it! The song ""Just Older"" seems to apply to many of the Bon Jovi fans, and I could really relate. Thanks for a job well done, guys!"
5,IT'S MY LIFE AND I LOVE BON JOVI!!!,Words cannot describe how awesome BON JOVI is!!! I am their #1 fan and no other group in this world produces such quality / entertaining / heartfelt music. I RECOMMEND YOU BUY CRUSH and ALL OF THEIR CDs!!!
5,BON JOVI IS BACK AND ARE BETTER THAN EVER,"I'm sure by no you've heard the hit ""It's my life"" about 100 times and even if you're not a big fan of rock you would still love Bon Jovi.Crush has songs that have real POWER in them not like the dumb rock bands now. Bon Jovi always had power in their sonds. Power in the words the music and ofcourse the dead-on singing by Jon. There songs have real power, like ""She's a Ride on a Mystery Train"" or ""One Wild Night"" or ""Thank You For Loving Me"" and of course ""It's My Life"". Those and much more are the ALL AMERICAN BEST !!!BON JOVI IS THE BEST FOREVER! BON JOVI FOREVER!"
3,Not bad!,"I usually don't listen to Rock, but 'It's my life' just swept me away! I nagged my parents & at last they bought me this CD. Well, how was it? Judging by the reviews all of you thought it was a smashing hit. I don't think otherwise-it WAS a smashing hit.But what does 'it' refer to? 'It's my Life', of course! Then what about the other songs? No other song in that album could compare to it! The only songs I liked were 'It's my life' & '2 Story Town'. The others just kept dragging along. I generally like songs with a good beat. Maybe the other songs were SUPPOSED to be like that. 'It's my life' got me really disillusioned. I thought all the songs were like that. Boy, was I wrong! But anyway, I don't regret buying it, only I've heard better songs."
3,Not a Bon Jovi comeback,"Bon Jovi's ""These Days"" featured a US top 10 hit and sold millions around the world. So why do people call ""Crush"" a comeback?No matter. Hit single ""It's My Life"" may be a throwback to the days of ""Livin' on a Prayer"", but it's great to hear a band be so triumphantly optimistic in the age of Mad-At-Your-Dad rock. Bon Jovi capture the spirit of their early releases and retain plenty of their signature sound while still moving forward. Beatles influences abound, whether on the underrated single ""Say It Isn't So"" or the tongue-in-cheek of ""Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars"" (the song is as good as the title). That old Bon Jovi mainstay, the power ballad, is in fine form too.No comeback, but a fine continuation."
5,Up there ...,"I totally love this album! For me, Bon Jovi is up there with Bryan Adams, Aerosmith and Journey. You can buy this album, you won't regret it."
4,Top album,"It took a few listens to realize this is a top album. They have a more modern sound and experimented to good effect. Best tracks are: 'next 100 year' , 'say it isn't so', 'save the world' & 'captain crash'. I hope to see the boys tour downunder."
5,Such great stories!,"I could not put this down, now it may not be for everyone, my sister thought it was too slow - but, I found myself glued to Aunt Jane's stories."
1,"the worst ""war book"" I have ever read","This was a typical example of a very poor book written by a pseudo-intellectual who spent little if ANY time in real combate.Oh how I wished he had spent at least two days and nights on patrol behind enemey lines with my squad in Korea. As far as I can tell, Gray doesn't have any idea what real hand to hand combate is all about. He has NO right to judge the actions of real soldiers in combate or what they are thinking or feeling.My recomendation is to please do not buy this ""book"".Thank you.SFC Case"
1,The objective turns subjective in the hands of these authors,"The authors fail at every turn to display an unbiased view of the world which every critical thinker does best to attain. Instead of being objective and raising questions in a philosophical way, they use their fallacy recognition to present an emotionally charged counter-attack. The authors are outraged at fallacious reasoners and even use emotional language in describing the view of one such reasoner as a ""goody-goody idea"". One might consider these authors unqualified to write such a book intended to promote objective reasoning. I suggest a more logical and unbiased work on the subject, such as _The_Art_of_Deception_."
5,Tommy Hilfiger Men's Society Slip-on Shoes,"I took a chance when I bought these for my son because I couldn't be sure if they would fit or if he would even like them... They turned out to be one of the best gifts I got him! The fit was very true to size, and he loved the quality of the leather. I can honestly say I did good on this one!!!"
3,Not closed caption,I remember seening this movie... However it's not closed caption nor does it have a menu where you can turn on subtitle. The movie is good. However I didn't watch it but I only remember back during my youth days. I would have enjoyed it more if it was on Closed Caption. That's why I got the movie. To refresh the story on my mind. Now it's going to be collecting dust bunnies.
5,Voices DVD,"I never saw the movie until I recently saw the DVD for sale on Amazon. I have the soundtrack to the movie on vinyl record. Burton Cummings does an excellent job in the track ""I Will Always Wait For You"". Amy Irving and Mike Ontkean were great in this love story! I would recommend this movie DVD to anyone who enjoys watching Amy Irving or Mike Ontkena! Five stars!!!"
5,Voices for Parents of Deaf Children,"I first watched this movie on television many years ago.I believe it was 1979 when released. This movie had suchan impact on me since I have two sons who were both borndeaf. Amy Irving performed tremendously so well that Ireally thought she was deaf herself. I have been tryingto purchase this movie ever since but was unable to find ituntil I searched online. I just recently ordered the movieand am very excited to be able to see it again. I am curiouswhy this particular movie has not been shown more. Thismovie was performed so great by all actors with a lot ofemotion and feeling. I will cherish this story forever.I am still trying to locate the soundtrack or a certain songthat was done in sign language by Amy Irving with the children.I think the title was ""You can swim like a fish if you want to""."
4,No major changes,"WARNING!! There is no substantial difference between the 3rd and 4th editions of the Burmese phrasebook. Calling it a new edition is a bit of a misrepresentation. The page numbering, titles, subtitles, phrases, and dictionaries are unchanged, only the 4 pages on whether to visit Myanmar at the end of the 3rd edition has been replaced by 3 pages of sustainable travel phrases by San San Hnin Tun in the 4th edition. So if you have the 3rd edition, save your money. If you don't, then buy the 4th edition."
3,Good for beginning conversational Burmese.,"This phrasebook, published by Lonely Planet,is geared toward travel to Burma. Travel to Burma puts money in the pocket of the Military Regime and not the suffering people. This is good for beginning to learn conversational Burmese."
1,"Nice, but they didn't last long.","I received these earings and the matching necklace for Christmas, and a month later, the pearl fell off one of the posts. My boyfriend is going to try to contact the company to get his money back, but I'm still upset that they broke!Other than that, they were small, but pretty, and if they were better attached to the posts, they'd be great!"
5,A gift that is good looking and a good value,"I gave these earrings as a gift. They are exactly as described. The 6.0-6.5mm size is small, yet so is the price.A note about the 14k stems. My wife's ears react badly to many stems, however she says these are fine.I read a review about the pearl falling off...I will write a PS if this happens to my wife's earrings."
1,Pearl Earrings,"The pearls came off the post after two months of use. I would like my money back. I also purchased at the same time, a pair of gold earrings, those also came off their post four weeks after purchase! I would like my money back for those as well."
1,"yes, they also fell off","I bought these as my wifes push gift about 10 month ago, and the pearl came off today. no warranty, since Amazon only offers a 30 day warranty.they were nice, but buyer beware. It seems like they don't last."
4,Great book,"This is a guide book for Sushi, not a cookbook. It will help you to understand some of the history and etiquette of Sushi. It has wonderful pictures. The author has made a sincere effort to help you enjoy the Sushi adventure. In closing this is much better than a European guide book. Buy it and start your adventure."
4,Interesting older sushi book,"First book in English on sushi. Excellent photos, especially for 1981. The text isn't terribly strong though, there's not a lot of content to it frankly. And it's rather dated now, knowledge and taste for good sushi (though perhaps not especially authentic sushi) is widespread in the States now, and this is a less novel work today. Still worthwhile for the both the photos and the historical perspective. Don't spend a lot on it though."
5,Excellent & moving,"One poem here is titled ""Our Daily Losses,"" which might well serve as a summary of this excellent collection's theme and tone. Although the poems often display a comic edge, and are never ponderously solemn, Nelson's always got his eye on the attritions of daily life. He is especially moving as a poet of family and love, accordingly, since his gaze is both clear and honest in mixing joy with grief, melancholy with pleasure, dream with reality, fear with contentment, and so forth. Solidly crafted with vivid, precise language, his poems are accessible and thoughtful."
3,a light reading,"a howling in the woods by velda johnston is not one of her best. i have very muchliked a few of her books that i have read but, this story is, so-so. it did keep my interest to the end but,i guessed who the ""bad guys"" were before the conclusion of the book.this story is about a little girl who was murdered (in the past)but,because the killer was not caught,the townsfolk preferred to act as if it did not happen and forget about it.as a consequence of the murder,the town did not trust any strangers which,brings us to the main female character of the story and that is lisa stanhope.lisa inherited a hotel in the town of jericho,nevada from her uncle and wanted to check it out and open the hotel again to make a profit.....little did lisa know she getting into a big murder/mystery involving herself and the town. what will happen to lisa? the killer is closer to her than she knows... will she discover who is responsible for the murder and why?"
5,a special place in my heart,"My mother and I are the characters in this book. Virginia, the illustrator was a friend of my mother's. I remember the chilly fall afternoons running around in my bathing suit while Ginny took photos of us. This book will always have a special place in my heart, as Ginny was illustrating it when my father was in the last stages of his cancer and it documents a stressful time in my family's history. Sheila Cole writes a sweet story that offers an introduction to underwater life to young children, and Ginny's use of watercolor is beautiful. There is a glossary of sealife in the back, so it is also a nice fieldguide for children. I give it as a baby shower gift whenever I can, though it is getting increasingly more difficult to find new. Though I am obviously biased, I highly recommend it as an addition to any child's library."
4,seems fine to me,"I was having a very difficult time choosing a sleeping bag (well, finding one for that matter) for my 3 and 7 year old that was an actual quality bag for kids. I looked at the eureka grasshopper and the north face tigger but I kept coming back to this one because of reviews/price. We have not taken them out in the cold yet so I cannot reply on there level of protection but I will say that the build quality is very good for the price. The kids have been playing in them for a couple weeks now in the house and have had no zipper issues like other reviews have mentioned and they seem to be holding up fine. I will update after a couple weekends in the woodsies."
3,It's dry,"I'm not super impressesed with extra dry as the chain gets noisy fast when riding single track, paved rides may work better for this lube. I've tried Pro Link, not impressed, got hooked on Purple extreme for a year, but now I'm using Boeshield T9 which for me is the best. I apply after every offroad ride, back pedal with a rag and apply a fresh coat and it's ready for the next ride. Easy, no fuss, and easy to clean the drivetrain when you get to the point it needs cleaned."
2,"they may be unique, but that doesn't make them good","apartment 26 was supposed to be big (i guess) especially witht he lead singer being the son of black sabbath's guitarist (i believe this is right).well its a very electronically tinged cd and it overwhelms the entire disc.it sounds like a childs play album at some points.biff's singing is fair,not too great but not bad.it seems like the only time you hear any instruments is ont he choruses which just dont do it for me.apartment 26 just doesnt fit in in the music industry and this might have led to their demise (they broke up a few months ago)."
2,Drawn by the radio,"I was moved to buy the album by their amazing song, ""Give Me More"" which is a fun and energetic swing song. When the CD arrived, I played the whole thing and didn't like it very much...then I played it again...and still I didn't like it.Nothing aside from the first song seems to be at all catchy. All I remember now is that I didn't like much of it at all.I'd suggest somehow hearing the whole album before you buy it yourself (unless you don't mind paying the hefty $3 used prices) in case you don't end up liking it. Your tastes might be different than mine..."
5,"Different, yet good","I was a light Apartment 26 fan for awhile, then heard they made a new albumn. I had heard songs like ""Death"" and ""Bruised"" and loved them. I saw Music for the Massive on sale for like $10 and picked it up without lisetning to it.I was suprised because it sounded NOTHING like Hallucinating. However, i wasn't a hardcore Apt. 26 fan before hand so i enjoyed the albumn quite a bit. The tracks are a bit more pop-like than their first albumn, however they have a very unique sound to them, are catchy, and take a long time to get old. This is one of the few CD's i've had for over 6 months and still lisetn too."
1,Absolute poppy garbage!,"Apartment 26 showed a great deal of promise with their previous album. They revealed a blend of industrial, techno, and electronica that was at times dramatic and at other times pensive and thought provoking. This new release lacks the punch, originality, and entertainment value of the first, instead trading for radio friendly poppy/hip hop style trash. If you are looking for a rehash of what you hear on the radio over and over again buy this album. If you were a fan of the first don't bother with this one."
4,pretty good,"i have been a fan of apartment 26 since 2000 with their debut album ""hullucinating"" and this album seemed like it took forever to come out. after waiting till 2003 i gave up on these guys and finally found out they were releasing something again. this album, while much different then hullucinating, is very good. its a real breath of fresh air from all those teenie boppers on the radio these days. this cd isnt really the industrial/techno/rock that apt 26 used to be.. its more less alternative rock with a few elements of industrial. the lyrics are simple but alot of times catchy. my favorites on here include: give me more, 88, kick to the head, and the hidden/instrumental track which as far as i can tell is titled ""Resolve"". if you're a fan of their first cd then this will most likely please you... but if you're expecting more hard hitting techno beats then your in for a let down. either way this cd doesnt dissapoint"
4,Refreshing!,I enjoyed the last cd they put out but am actually more impressed with this one. Give Me More is clearly the best and most interesting track with its metal meets jazz sound. The other songs are almost all good and keep the listener interested. The sound/production quality as well as the music has matured. There are maybe 1 or 2 songs that wouldn't be missed but over all it is a great cd.
4,Massively entertaining,"I didn't know what to expect from this cd, I'd never heard any of Biff's tunes before, but was hoping they would be a chip off the old block, musically speaking.I was not disappointed. The first song is really good & sets the tone for the entire cd. It encorporates a lot of different styles while still being fairly hard...think maybe an Incubus influence. I liked this cd enough that I'll purchase more of their efforts."
3,"Brilliant musicianship, sophomoric lyrics and commentary","Blackmore's brilliant musicianship is poorly reflected in Candice Night's sophomoric lyrics and commentary. This was OK for the first album and has become more obvious, particularly on this release.Buy this CD for Blackmore's performance but grit your teeth when Candice Night starts talking like an ""Oh wow, isn't this great?"" tourist."
4,Excellent Fayre...,"I'm afraid I can't agree with Captain Jax, when he says Blackmore's Night lack the spark on stage of a realy talented band, I assume he hasn't seen the Castles And Dreams DVD..however, onto this album, my one criticism is that ""The Clock Ticks On"" is not it..otherwise it's a very good representation of how BN sound live.Everyone plays well Candice is in fine voice and they sound as though they are having a great time, I've been a fan of Ritchie since Deep Purple In Rock, and I think he has paid his dues to the rock world. Carry on Ritchie.This is great music."
4,oh back to 400 years where the minstrels played their tunes!,"We are going back to 400 years ago, where the minstrel played their tunes!if you don't know Ritchie Blackmore and his currently semi medieval tunes and pls let him go!!!!There are too many idiots here who do not recognize that Ritchie will not play the same type of music like he did in the past with Rainbow or DP.The live set /songs are wonderful to listen to, if you could find the magical moment! I personally love the current style of Ricthie and Candice. I will see them on the next tour in some old german castles.....I love ya Ritchie!"
5,Blackmore Renaissance,"An excellent sounding live CD of a stunning performance of Blackmore's Night. This CD, more than anything, shows that Blackmore has left Purple behind and has gone on with his life. Whilst the old Purple boys are still out on the road, rehashing past history and trying to live in the early 70s, Blackmore has moved to new directions (based on some of his old themes) to create new, and as another reviewer put it, refreshing, music. Ronnie James Dio, apparently miffed that a Rainbow reunion is not in the cards, has been critical of Blackmore's new direction. Well Ronnie, Candice sings your own song (16th Century Greensleeves) better than you ever did on this CD. Other high points inclde Fires At Midnight and Shadow Of The Moon."
5,Refreshing,"Simply put, there is not enough of this sort of playful Renaissance inspired music around. Ritchie Blackmore is a music legend in his own right, and it is a daring move to seek out a musical niche that acknowledges musical history. There is something refreshingly new about a musical artist not trying to be new, but rather trying to just be exceptional in his craft. Whether the instrumentation is classical or modern, this group manages to transport us to another time when it was not enough to just come out with a new hit song on every album, but rather to engage the audience and entertain with exceptional skill. Candice Night has a wonderful voice to lend to the inspired musical tapestry. This double album contains performance live recordings and I was afraid that perhaps the audience would detract from the music quality. Instead the intimate atmosphere of friendly encouragement from the audience only serves to add to the power of this collection."
4,blackmore is a forever guitar player!,"Many people loved him during his period with Deep Purple and Rainbow. Ritchie Blackmore is an awesome personality, his music, his lyric and his musically charismatic conquered the heart of the rock fans in the 70's and 80's. And now He joins Ms. Candice Night on this pretty medieval album. The result is a huge fascination...the trip to the old medieval time/renaissance era. Miss Night is a very sweet girl and has a good voice. The songs like crowning of the king, possums last dance, times they are a changing etc....reminding us on the classical 16th Baroque century. The musical composition on this cd were helped by some german classical experts, Ritchie has known in the good old Deutschland. Ritchie Blackmore is always my favourite guitar player of all time. (...)"
4,Well-interpreted Beethoven Symphonies,"This recording was my first complete cycle of Beethoven symphonies; for this reason, I might be a little positively biased. However, I still think this recording is a very good one.The Birmingham orchestra - well, you don't hear much about them; they are not in the same league as the Berliners, the Viennese, the LSO .... Regarding the orchestra's precision, I'm not impressed. Also, you might think they lack in dynamics and explosiveness (this, of course, could also be due to the somehow ""closed"" audio-sound). On the other hand, they have a beautiful tone, lean back and dwell on longer notes, which gives you a fat-bottomed expression, which in my opinion really suits Beethoven.Conductor, herr Weller, pulls the orchestra up on a high level. His interpretaion is one of the best, I think. If you like Karajan's recordings, this one is a good supplement.There's no reason not to buy this recording - plus, you can get it at a bargain price."
4,Worth it.,"I bought this album in the hopes that it would sound like an extension of Midnight Sounds. In many ways, it does. The same sparse organ and vibraphone tones are there, as is a lot of very dry, abrupt (maybe even abbreviated?) percussion, most of which (if not all) is electronic. Unlike Midnight Sounds, the percussion is not quite as lush, not quite as exploratory. Most tracks are not as complex or cerebral, either. It does, however, have the excellent precision and consistent groove that brought me to Flanger.This whole album is minimalist, very tasteful, groovy, smokey, mellow, smoothe, roomy, hip, and very satisfying. Stylistically, it's heavily lounge/bossa nova/samba-influenced jazz. Flanger has a gift for making largely electronic music sound like very organic effortless jazz. Maybe it's all the vinyl clicks and white noise.4/5 because I think Midnight Sounds is a 5."
5,great for kids and parents,"i thought it was great for my kids and even though its very old, its got a lot of things i remember from when i was a kid and it was a joy to share it with my two little ones."
3,Not too bad if you look into the film pretty deeply.....,"I have to state that the only reason I viewed this film was because of a requirement for one of my classes. But anyway, after discussion in class, some of the hidden ideas that Gutierrez and Desnoes wanted to express became evident. The film itself deals with the segregation of the main character, Sergio, from reality. You might ask, ""What does he live in then?"" Sergio lives in his own reality, constanly attempting to make everything the way he wants it to be. By the end of the film, Sergio ends up being destroyed because he won't conform and join the Revolution. The film was used by the Cuban Revolutionaries to entice the non-conformers to join the Revolution so that they could avoid the same destruction experienced by Sergio. Overall, it was alright. Watch it if you want."
1,not what i thought,this was a let down. I bought this item to go with my sons geo trax train sets and once i got it found out it only holds the old style remotes and the new ones are too big. Now the description does say something about sounds from the old remotes but I did not realize the new ones were too big so we cannot use it....
3,Garnet earrings,These are lovely although they are very heavy so I cannot wear them for an entire day.
2,Too silly to be plausible,"This is a well-written satire with some of the same ingredients that work well in other works by the great Graham Greene. But in this case both the characters and the action are too far into the realm of comics to be believable. [Of course you might say that Graham Greene knew infinitely more about incompetence and delusion in the Secret Service than I do, and without doubt that is true, but Greene's other similar books (e.g., The Comedians) don't go this far and look more like the truth.] The dialogue ranges toward the cute. The best parts are the conversations between Wormold and his daughter Millie. Those involving Dr. Hasselbacher are rather good also. At his best Greene wrote as well as Hemingway, but not in this book."
3,Disappointed,"I read a lot of Graham Greene, and this is the one one of his works that disappointed. Characters were dull and the plot, slow to develop. Also, the technology described seemed very dated in view of today's world."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"Well for once a Greene book didn't really appeal to me. I think this is meant to be a spy-comedy, but as usual I didn't laugh one single time! I think Greene had intended this to be a good humoured comment to a time which was very tense upon the cold war. Things like that just don't really appeal to me, sory Greene!"
4,A very funny book!,"A vacuum cleaner salesman turned secret service spy? The premise alone should have you hooked and the book is just as good. Filled with subtle humor and interesting twists, Greene is one of the most talented novelists I've had the pleasure to read. This book is a buried treasure of modern literature. Go get it!"
5,Wonderful fun ...,Start to finish ... this is a classic. You'll laugh out loud ... and never look at vacuum cleaners the same way again.READ it Amici ... READ ...
3,"Good, but not amazing","This book has a really good, funny plot. I loved a lot! However, i did find that it was a bit unclear at times. But generally, it's a great book. I strongly recommend it!"
1,defective disc Number 4,"This review pertains to the audiobook cd set. Disc 4 had some kind of flaw that would stop the disc and keep it stuck in the drive, impossible to eject by normal means. So I used a paper clip in the tiny hole to open the drive and remove the disc. I tried it in another drive. Same problem. I returned it to Amazon. Amazon sent a replacement. I tried Disc 4. Same problem. I returned it to Amazon and asked for a refund. Very disappointing."
5,"Excellent Piece, Well Worth It","We purchased and then returned this item in favor of the same-sized pearl (6.0 - 6.5mm) on a yellow gold chain purely out of the preference of the person we were giving it to, who is a blonde.We were also a little afraid, knowing white gold from our engagement ring, that the coating would rub off and, of course, it would be the lower-grade rhodium plating (almost certain), and eventually rub off. This sounded like a pain.So in the end, we stuck with the ""traditional"" yellow gold and it is lovely. This is a lovely piece too, well worth the 5 stars for the price."
4,Just Plain Awesome,A great cd full of hard house and hard trance that will simply blow your mind. A must have for any fan.
4,Yummy Udon Soup,"I initially got hooked on Annie Chun's at my local grocery store. Unfortunately, they sell these soups at ~$5 a piece, so Amazon (or Trader Joe's) offers a much better deal. I enjoyed the udon soup because of the chunky noodles. If you have tried the miso soup, the udon soup's broth I think is stronger in flavor in comparison. I also love that the bowl is biodegradable; though the packaging for the soup base and toppings are not.If you feel like the noodles are not tender enough, just microwave for an extra 30 seconds to soften them up.Bon appetit!"
2,expensive but not good taste,"my biggest complain is the amount of noodle is really really small, I should eat at least 5 bowls of this noodle to make me feel not hungry, and I am absoultely not a big man. The taste of noodle is ok, not excellent. I would not buy the noodle again if the price is any amount more than $1/per pack."
5,Great Quality for Box Noodles,"Officially these are box noodles. With that in mind, I think these are good quality. I recommend soaking the noodles first as instructed. I like the taste, the noodles have good texture, and I crave them when I am under the weather. The broth is mild, yet more appealing to a diverse palate than plain chicken noodle. Note the serving size states it is .5 of bowl, but I'm not sure who just eats half. Even with eating all, the calories and fat are decent for a lunch, but as with most packaged foods-- the sodium is a bit high. Also, it should be a given since it is noodles-- that this is not a low carb friendly meal, but it does not attempt to be. I did find that buying it as a 6 pack from Amazon was much cheaper than my local grocery."
2,Ok in a hurry but...,"This is OK if you are in a super hurry and have no other options. But, the taste of the flour in the noodles is kind of odd and it is a rather small portion. If you spice it up with garlic and ginger, it is not half bad."
4,Pretty good if you add stuff,"The udon tastes okay by itself but is not very filling. If you add other things such as more red pepper flakes, meat, mushrooms, etc it becomes much better. Otherwise decent if you are not a fan of the other instant noodles such as cup ramen."
4,Good stuff,"Annie Chun's makes a line of soups and noodle bowls, among other shelf-stable items, and also labels which ones are vegan (not all varieties are). I've been eating the Udon bowl for a while now, and it's my favorite ""instant"" soup. There are three packets--noodles, toppings, and seasonings, and you put all three in a bowl, add water, and heat in the microwave for a minute to 75 seconds. The broth is rich and savory, and the toppings reconstitute into recognizable vegetables (especially the mushrooms). It's my go-to lunch when I need something quick at work or I'm not feeling well.The bowls are also reusable--I've noticed my coworkers using them for other things--so that reduces landfill waste.My only gripe is that while it's 110 calories per serving, a serving is half a bowl. I can't imagine anyone will save the rest of the soup for later! I usually eat the whole thing. Still, I absolutely recommend it."
5,So simple and delicious!,"This Annie Chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. I don't think the first step is necessary either. Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables, cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. Add the sauce packet. The noodles loosen up after you stir it. If you what a more filling soup, add meat/vegetables. My kids and I really love this soup! I just purchased more from Amazon, because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store!"
2,Very bland soup,"The broth is really bland and has no taste. Its one of the worst broths I have ever tasted. The noodles themselves are decent. Not the best noodles but not the worst so it gets 2 stars instead of 1. Maybe I just needed to add lots of garlic and spices like some other reviewers stated but right out of the box, this is just not very good."
1,Don't waste your money! yuck!,"It's the worst soup ever! and super expensive.I don't understand how someone like this carton tasteless noodles, I don't buy it again and want my money back."
3,Better than a cup 'o noodles,"But that'd damning it with faint praise. It was ok, but lacked flavor and the freeze dried veggies were rather pathetic. The tofu was pretty bad. I definitely won't buy again."
4,"Convenient,quick and good!","This is a good tasting, quick lunch item.I bought it on the ""Subscribe and Save Program so it was even more reasonably priced and even standard delivery was quick."
4,Very good,Very light on the tummy with a wonderful aroma and taste. The noodles are tender and not too soft. Wonderful soup and easy to prepare.
4,Getting this AGAIN,"Yep, like the title, I'm getting this again. The first shippment lasted 1 week. Here's my review... This is a great quick meal for lunch in the office. Instead of spending 5 or 6 bucks to get add extra lipids to my arteries, I decided to try these noodles.The noodles were already cooked sealed in a vaccum bag. The dehydrated vegtables actually look like vegtables after you add water to it. Overall, I felt it was a pretty ""authentic"" Udon experience. I really enjoyed these noodles. Also, at 110 cal per serving ( there is 2 servings in the bowl ) its a not too bad for you. If you want something quick, great tasting, and not good for you, this is your item.The sodium is a bit high, but you can always control that with how much of the soy sauce you put in. Overall, I give it 4 stars... cause there's always room for improvement!"
5,Best soup ever.,"I love this soup. It has remained one of my favorite soups for over 5 years now. Regular grocery stores charge up to $5 for a single soup, where the least expensive store which sells it (Trader Joe's), sells it for $2.69. When I found out that Amazon has an amazing deal on these, I was soo happy. If you sign up to have it shipped on a monthly basis, you get a 15% discount AND free shipping!We have a six pack delivered to our doorstep every month for what ends up being only $2.35 per soup and free shipping!! Between my husband and I, we have no problem going through 3 soups each per month without feeling worn out on it.This is by far the best Annie Chun's soup out there and the best deal I've ever seen for it. Delicious flavor, easy as pie cooking instructions, and thick yummy noodles. Especially with the soup filled months of winter coming up, this is an excellent purchase. Especially when it saves you money and a bag worth of soup to lug home from the grocery store."
3,Not as good as Nong Shim Udon,"Nong Shim Udon:Nong Shim Udon Bowl Noodle, 9.73-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 6)Annie Chun's Udon compare to Nong Shim Udon:1. For soup base, Nong Shim Udon has stronger soy sauce taste, Annie Chun's Udon has weaker soy sauce taste but has a little trend of sour taste;2. For udon, Nong Shim Udon more chewy(AL Dante), Annie Chun's Udon taste more mushy;3. For udon, Nong Shim Udon need longer soak time to get rid of sour taste, while Annie Chun's need much less time;4. For packaging, Nong Shim Udon has 6 holes on lid (6 each side), that makes it much easier to pour out first time soaking water."
2,Average,"I found it to be too watery. Didn't taste like anything. I was hoping for an authentic, at least flavored taste but it ended up tasting like nothing."
1,BIG Disapointment,"I have been getting this soup at a local store and really enjoy the flavor. When I saw this on line with the better price I ordered immediately.Guess there was a reason it was on line, when I opened the packet of noodles they began to fall apart into small pieces. When reconstituted in hot water they turned into a thick gelatinous mess that fell apart when I tried to eat it.I tried to return or order a replacement and was told through the web I could not do this with food items, even if unopened. I can understand that, however there must be a recourse for products that are not usable as described or sold.Now I have 5 bowls of this I have to throw out. Would have been better to have gotten at a higher price locally."
1,Bad enough for me to actually seek out a way to review it...,"I have absolutely no idea why anyone would enjoy eating noodles that taste like vinegar flavored play-doh, but I do not. I am kind of shocked at how bad this and the ""Teriyaki"" noodle bowl are. Such sour, disgusting noodles... I couldn't even bring myself to eat them, despite being extremely hungry both times that I attempted it. Seriously, I prefer the flavor and texture of those cheap instant Ramen noodle cups over this gross crap, any day- and the price difference is huge."
3,"Yummy, But Beware of Likely GMO","My wife eats tons of these, and I occasionally enjoy them too. However, people should know that the sauce contains a lot of soy which is almost definitely GMO (genetically modified) - this may have unknown health risks. I've done quite a bit of research online and not found Annie Chun saying anything otherwise. Hopefully they will start caring more about their customers in the future. Until then I only eat the noodles (I add non-gmo sauce from other soups)."
3,Not as good as I expected but O.K.,Well..It is not restaurant quailty udon soup I'say but the taste was O.K. I If I need a quick fix for lunch I would get this again but if I want the real taste of udon... I'd definitely go to a nearby restaurant.
2,Annie Chung Noodle Bowl Not for Prime Time,This product is overrated. It had one piece of tofu! The white noodles have no nutritionalvalue. It is not worth $1.99 at Trader Joes! Try Progresso Lite!
4,Raider Flannel PJ pants,My husband loved the pants. Received as expected and quickly. No complaints.
3,"good idea, but missing pieces, wrong pieces in the box","The girls are having fun with this house but there were two left-opening doors for the upstairs instead of one left hand and one right hand, so on one side of the house the interior wall is on the outside and the exterior wall is on the inside. There were no light fixtures included at all - description said they were included. There is no way and 8 year old could assemble this house. I don't think my 10 year old could assemble it, but they were just as happy to do it with my help. If I can get the right pieces it may still be a success. Since the house is cardboard I do not expect it to last very long."
3,Travelers' Tales Grand Canyon at it's best.,"Interesting stories; I've been in Grand Canyon and relate to several of these tales. Enjoyed reading them. One problem: Several of the stories left out the dates being discussed. Some talked of ""cold water"" in the Colorado......so I ASSUMED the ""tale"" was after the Glen Canyon Dam was functioning. But I had to guess about most..........looks like the date could have been included. The writing of the stories were somewhat disjointed at times but, I guess, that would be expected from amateurs. Overall, an enjoyable book."
3,"OK, but there are better ones","I am a therapist and am always looking for resources to utilize in my work with children, adolescents, and families. However, many of the exercises in this book require a lot of extra supplies, which can add up to a lot of money. There are some good ideas in the book, but I've found much better resources that contain exercises that can be used individually, in groups, as homework, and don't cost anything but the time and money to copy a few pages. I was disappointed when I got this book because it requires too much when you've got an overload of clients to see."
4,Chain oil,"Its price is reasonable. However, it does not help much for my bicycle chain to work properly. The chain is still dry. You have to apply this oil to your chain almost every week."
3,Pedro's Ice Wax,"Only used it once so far (haven't been on the bike lately), but it's easy to use and does the trick well. I'd recommend it for the price especially."
5,Great quality product,"Great for ayurvedic oil infusions. I have been using it regularly to infuse my various home made herbs and it works great. It is highly absorbent and makes an excellent, non-greasy moisturizer for dry, itchy skin and scalp."
5,Face Aerobics Rocks!,"I have been exercising my face with Face Aerobics for the last month and I am amazed at the difference already! My face looks so much younger! I am especially pleased with the way the exercises have sculpted my jaw line and firmed up my ""turkey"" neck. I still have not completely lost my double chin, but I think I'll have to lose a few pounds for that.The exercises in this video are easy to learn. Each exercise is demonstrated in a clear and effective manner. I have learned the exercises well and committed them to memory. Now I do the exercises while I'm in the car, watching TV or while I'm one the phone!Face Aerobics is terrific and has saved me thousands of dollars in cosmetic surgery. I will continue exercising my face and keep recommending this video to everyone!"
1,Two months and no results!,"I was given Face Aerobics as a gift and was excited to try this series of exercises. Who doesn't want to look their best? I followed along doing the exercises twice daily. After 2 months of really making an effort I was most disappointed at not seeing any change. I have since tried another facial exercise program and actually saw my eyes change in 7 days. An eyelift would have cost me $3,200.00. Face Aerobics didn't work for me but I was happy to find that facial exercise does work if you have the right program."
1,"Poorly explained, poorly produced video.","Save your $$! This is a poorly explained, poorly produced, VERY SHORT video. The idea of face exercises sounds good, but there HAS to be a better product on this subject. I was very disappointed. It's very hard to tell from the minimal explanation on this video whether you are doing the exercises properly, and if not, you may be doing more harm than good."
1,Many of these reviews are bogus,"The next six reviews are bogus (I gave up at six). If this doesn't set off a red flag, it should.10/11/2004 Chica9/22/2004 Karenn, SpicedGirl9/31/2004 Ocean Scotty4/5/2004 Anna Houle1/31/2004 Lois"
5,My favorite!,This is my favorite Christmas cd. I love Cher and the Calling the best! I would purchase this one if you have the chance.
5,63 corvette easy build,"very fun easy build. looks great just like it is out of the box, i liked the way this model looked without having to modify anything. i do suggest using gloves when applying the stickers, a little bit of heat from a hair dryer helps mold the small ones around emblems. very fun, very easy, very affordable. loved it"
5,Fun time,"It's been awhile since building models as a kid, but I truly enjoyed the fun of snapping this kit together in a short while and not worrying about glue or paint."
4,Great starter model,"I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He seemed very pleased and enjoyed putting it together. This is a great model for younger boys since there is no glue and no paint. There are quite a few parts and decals to assemble, but it snaps together so doesn't require a lot of adult supervision or assistance."
2,OK but fragile,My 9 year old son started to put this together and while placing the steering wheel into the column the lower part broke and now does not have a steering wheel. Seems a little too fragile to me for a child to be snapping together.
3,if you like this then buy Uma Batida Diferente,"I love Brazilian music--from classic Bossa Nova and Samba to the current remixes and new approaches. I think this album deserves about a C+. It's pleasant enough, but it's kind of flat--the tunes don't really come alive; they're a bit monotonous. They don't have the subtlety and feel of the classic bossa nova and they don't have the energy and rhythmic interest of the next Bossacucanova disc--Uma Batida Diferente. So if you like this one, then you really should buy Uma Batida Diferente (that one gets an A)."
5,Great!!,Bossacucanova puts on modern day arrangements to classic bossa nova tunes. Great addition to anyone's bossa nova collection.
4,It's okay for the price,"This software is okay for the price. I have found that it is a bit difficult to use however and the instructions don't really help for you to figure out what you don't understand about it. But I can't complain considering what I paid for the program when other management software costs hundreds of dollars in comparison. It may well be able to do many of the things that I am not able to get it to do, I just can't figure it out. Again, the instructions aren't as detailed as they could be. A hard copy of the instruction manual would be nice rather than having to leave the software to read how to use it. Overall, it will do what I need it to do so I'm not complaining too much."
4,Splendid Story,"You know the story is good when you go to your car on your lunch break to read. Forwards & Backwards peaks your interest right from the start. The lively, in-depth, and well developed characters jump off of the pages and introduce themselves to you. The story line propelled me from page to page with such vigor, that when I got to the last page I was startled. I love that Jacquese has twists and turns in this story that mirrors suspense movies. You won't be disappointed. I do however, wish that there were more aesthetic descriptions of the characters. The existing ones were so sketchy that I couldn't successfully imagine what some of the characters looked like. I knew who they were, how they thought, and what they liked, but the characters lacked real description. Nevertheless, that didn't take away from the perilous tale."
4,Family secrets,"Forwards and Backwards is a story full of family secrets. It shows how one secret impacts the whole family. Once I started reading this story, I couldn't put the book down. This one is full of twists and turns. The characters came to life. What was the deal with Jordon? She was just spoiled. Her father and brothers spoiled her. Treye was so sweet. I enjoyed the story of the Whitaker family. Best wishes to Jacquese Council-Silvas God's Blessing."
4,"Good overall, but one major weakness","The book is well organised, well written and accessible. It covers all the basic vocabulary you need as a tourist and provides a good introduction to the language. It is largely jargon-free and you don't need to know any complicated grammatical terminology to use the book. The tapes/CDs are excellent - don't order the book without them if you want to get the most out of this teach-yourself course. The one big weakness - and it is a very big weakness - is that the book does not contain any information about word stress. Since there are no clear rules for word stress, the learner encounters many new words in the text (often not included on the tape) but without knowing how to pronounce them properly. Adding accents to denote the word stress would transform this from a good to an excellent book."
3,not there best but still ok,although this album is not their best work it still has plenty to keep born from pain fans happy. The political commentary was unnessary and some of the instrumenation on the early tracks had a cheap keyboard sound which is why I deducted 2 stars. But the other tracks are good and make this cd worth having.
2,Dissapointing.,"Been a huge fan of this band since 2002 - had the privilege of playing with them when they were in their prime, but this album is pretty dissapointing, when Che left they should have disbanded - the new vocalist's vox are really dissapointing and just don't have much kick or conviction to them..the album sounds lazy and rushed, the 2-3 awesome tracks are all bunched together near the end but a lot of the album sounds like lazy politics over music which comes nowehere near the excellence of 'sands of time'.Proceed with caution."
2,Not for me!!,The glasses were well made and had a great case BUT my face is not huge & my 20 yr old son said it looked like I had on his grandmother's Big wrap around sunglasses
5,good,The screen works well and arrived in pristine condition It fits my old machine which I was really surprized. and pleased.
2,"Not that good, there are better","This is not a very good book of Joan Chittister, the book feels dated and the thought patter is scattered. I thought for sure it was written in the early 1970s with the political bent and anti-traditionalist religious life feeling. The references to her young nun life in a community pre-molestation by experiments, is interesting as those are the very communities that are growing. ""Sister"" Joan has better books; Rule of St. Benedict Insights for the Ages is superior to this particular effort. Look for that book instead."
5,Spirituality at its best,"A must-read for those who are interested in living a life infused with spirituality. Readable, fascinating, and sound connections between The Rule of St. Benedict and life in the 21st century."
3,Tedious but interesting,"My first foray into the world of clive barker was this 600+ page passage that, I feel, could have said as much in half the space. The story was very fresh, unique and interesting, as well as dark and twisted. I enjoyed plunging into the corruptness of souls and their covetous desires. Sometimes character development lagged for major the characters. The first 1/3 of the book read like a nascar race, the remainder, a rush-hour traffic jam! Anyway, it was entertaining enough to read cover to cover, as well as peek my desire for number two. To his credit, Mr. Barker has created his own genre."
5,Another of the best books ever!,"I read this one about 11 years ago, along with the second book of the art, Everville, I have remembered these well all these years, these are stories and characters that are hard to forget. I just read them again, wanting to see if they were as good as I remembered, and they were even better! Clive Barker is one of my favorite Authors ever, and these stand the test of time as some of the best books ever written by him or any other person. Along with both books of Imajica, these are some of the best books you could ever read. I wish I could give them more than five stars!"
5,absintheur,"while the book is great for it's epic capacity & fine writing, i found the book to be very deep & philosophical dealing with the myriad corridors of the human mind. this book is not a gruseome horror novel but it keeps you coming back for more & it keeps you engaged while you read it. however, it may be a bit too deep for some people but you won't know unless you dive in."
5,Epic and amazingly entertaining!,"I've been a huge fan of Clive Barker since I was in middle school, but it had been a long time since I'd revisited his books. I picked up a copy of ""The Great and Secret Show"" recently to re-read, and was amazed at how well this book hold up. The imagination on display is simply astounding, and I love how epic this novel is. I can't wait to finish this again, and take a journey back to ""Everville."" A must read for Barker fans!"
4,GSS,"This book drones on for a while. But, it's not bad. And if I look back I suppose it was all needed to make the reader feel closer to the characters. A good read on a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG plane ride, and I mean long, like to China, then back to America."
1,I was dissappointed with this book.,"I couldn't really get into this book, although the concept was original, this was not a nail biter nor was I looking forward to picking up this book to want to finish it. For great horror/thriller reading, I would recommend Robert McMammon."
2,Super Reader,"Two men come into contact with some arcane information, and end up on opposite sides of a battle to gain control and power. The battle continues through the next generation, when their children and others become involved. It is just not as interesting as some of his other work, I think, despite the horror and magic themes that abound."
3,Ooooookkkkkaaaaayyyy,Without a doubt the weirdest book I have ever read. I loathed it and loved it. It entertained and revolted me. Full of originality yet swarming with cliche.My dream-life has been somewhat more complicated since reading this book. The waters of Quiddity must be getting choppy.
1,Don't do this to yourself.,"I do not honestly know what to say. This book, and the sequel ""Everville,"" (yes I actually read the second book after the first was so horrible; I was very bored) are disgusting and stupid. Usually Clive Barker puts a lot of style into his version of disgusting, but this garbage is simply shock horror. There are a few interesting ideas, but they are definately not worth wading through hundreds of dull pages for. I read Imajica after reading these, and I almost don't believe that he wrote it. So skip The Great and Secret Show, and pick up a copy of Imajica. IT gets 5 stars for sure."
3,Classic...Excellent,"This book is based upon the great idea that there is a hidden pattern/world within this one that points to sinister characters. The best part is the anti-hero, working in the dead letter office, who discovers hidden and terrible knowledge about the world through reading scraps and pieces of letters. Finding this loose thread, he follows it almost unravels the world.Unfortunately, like most Barker fiction, the book is heavily laced with homo-erotic imagery, which the reader soon tires of. The sequel is much worse at this and probably ultimately condemns Barker to classification as a ""gay"" writer, instead of a horror writer."
1,meandering and poorly written,This was the first (and so far the last) Clive Barker book that I've read. I was so disappointed that I had spent time reading this book that I considered throwing it away. Although promising at the beginning it became a true drudgery to complete. The story started out well but degenerated into ridiculous situations made worse by asinine dialogue. Avoid this book.
1,I really don't get it,"I read some good reviews of Clive Barker, and thought this book would be a good start to reading horror. I was very dissapointed. I read the first part of the book, the Messenger, the concept of ""the Art"" made no sense to me whatsoever, and i decided this was a waste of my time."
1,Not A Fan,"This was the first Clive Barker book I've read. I was not impressed by anything - characters, plot, or writing style. It was laborious to read and would never be a reading recommendation I would make. The story is not especially suspenseful or compelling and there was no real empathy established with the characters though horrific things happen to them."
5,A Masterpiece of Dark Fantasy,"""The Great and Secret Show"" is one of the best books I have ever read. I've read many Barker books and while all of them are fantastic, this one is unbelievable. Barker intwertwines his magnificent use of prose with his uncanny knack for details. This book will not dissapoint!Barker is superior not only to other horror novelists, but most writers in general. He writes, but at heart he's an artist. ""Show"" is his finest work yet. It combines unforgettable characters, magic, the apocalypse, horror, and a disgruntled mailworker in a fantastic adventure story that will surely stick with you forever."
4,Where does it go?,"If you're reading this review, I assume you haven't read the story...please read it, because it is begging to be read, and you should, at least, take pity on it. The book is long because its intended purpose (as I assume) was to have immense impact on its readers. It barely missed the mark in my case. The story drew me in with every chapter. I'm not much of a reader, but I read it all in three days (after work and all.) I'm not sure of its intended audience, but I'm sure it will touch the most skeptic of them all... I won't say much about the actual story, but its fault lies in its abundance of purpose...Barker seems to be coming to some realization, when in fact....well, this is me extrapolating on the author's vision. I suggest you see for yourself."
5,Worth the effort,"Like most of Barker's works, ""The Great and Secret Show"" is not an easy read, and is not recommended as an introduction to the fantasy/horror genre. For those who have the requisite mindset, though, this book is a jewel.Randolph Jaffe's corruption by the Nuncio, Fletcher's pitiful attempts to stop him, Jo-Beth and Howie's ultimate star-crossed love, Tesla, Raul, Kissoon, the terata and Lix... they're all burned into the reader's mind by the force of Barker's writing. The concepts embodied in TGaSS are mind-blowing: more than once since my first reading of this book and Everville, I've found myself thinking of ""the past, the future, and the dreaming moment between, all one country living one immortal day.""Barker's unconventional treatment of Christianity and homosexuality will doubtless offend some. For the more open-minded, and those with a bent for truly fantastic writing, ""The Great and Secret Show"" is an absolute treasure."
2,"This refers to the 'abridged' audiobook, not the novel.","This was a great book but this is an AWFUL abridgement. Literally, the tapes (672 pages boiled down to two audio cassettes) should be call THEGTW as that is how boiled down it is. Whole characters are gone. Whole story lines are discarded. Stephen King once said that he won't ever allow abridgements and now I understand why. Clive, if you are reading this...did you actually ok there tapes. They are really bad.DO read the novel. DO NOT buy, rent or borrow this horrific abridgement."
2,Disappointed,"I actually bought this book because of the great reviews. I was hoping for a gem. I had to actually force myself to continue to read it. I just couldn't find myself attached to any of the characters. I had absolutely no bond with the characters. Clive Barker is an excellent, beautiful writer. He is definitely gifted. I loved the concept of the book, but I just wish that the story was more developed. Mostly about what EXACTLY is the Art. I needed to know more about Quiddity, it's history, the Shoal, Kissoon. What exactly did Jaffe read in those letters to drive his ambition. Why did he believe those letters? I tried to get attached to the characters. Even the Good Man Fletcher. But something was missing from the characters. They lacked depth. Death boy was overboard. It's as if Barker is writing specifically for a movie. A ""B"" horror flick at that."
1,Disappointing,"This was my first (and so far sole) attempt to read Clive Barker. I thought overall the concept was intriguing, however, I felt that neither the premise was explained very well nor were there any characters I truly cared about. Half of my reaction to the book can be summed up in one word, ""Huh?"" The constant shifts in perspective never let me identify with any character, so I didn't care about any of them one way or another. I was simply indifferent. My own preference lies towards stories with very believable characters and unfortunately this one didn't fulfill that for me."
3,Great Imagination Spoiled by Average Writing,"Pros:Excellent imagination.Excellent story.Cons:Poor storytelling.I wanted to finish off this book and be done with it so many times. The writing style did not keep me hooked on to the story. Appeared as if written while the story was prematurely conceived. Otherwise, the imagination of the author is top class. I would have preferred to read an abridged version, which I strictly don't."
3,"A moving story, but lacking something","Cordelia is grieving the lost of her parents when she was christmas in Rome. There she meet Frank McCarthy a man who is scar on the inside and outside. This these are two a drawn together, but there there time is limited.""Leaving Winter"" is very short novel by Kathleen A. Quinn, while does have have a lot of emotional impact,it did seem that Ms. Quinn could have taken the time to make the book longer."
2,Not quite up to par,"Like other reviewers stated: this book has a good and uplifting message. The idea that a person's physical appearance doesn't deter them from wanting and finding a ""soul connection"" in our superficial world. And I enjoyed the author's narrative style of interjecting journal-like monologues from other character's point-of-view throughout the book. What I didn't like was the length of the story...around 100 pages...which I blame for the second disappointment, lack of character development and plot. There was a great plot outline in the story, but the actual tale was so linear and boring. It was like the framework of a great book was present, but wasn't ""fleshed"" out to my liking. The dialogue was a bit trite as well. No momentus revelations here folks. Nope, it's your plain and simple: ""I like you"" and ""I like you too Frank"" all the way to the end."
2,Great short story-poor novel,"Leaving Winter is a wonderful little story. However, it lacks character and plot development. Would have been much better in an anthology rather than a book of its own. I felt quite cheated by the brevity of it. Also, fellow readers, if you are looking for any descriptive narration of the love scenes...don't bother with this book. If you can find the book in the library, which I couldn't, get it there. If you are a fast reader, you will be able to complete this book in an hour or less. Not worth the price of admission."
4,my love hate relationship with gwar.... (mostly love though),"Gwar has 2 sides to them their metal-punk and their goofy fun side.This, like their last two, is one of their metal-punk albums, which is not to say that it's bad. (i perfer it to war party, due to the fact that you can understand the lyrics at least on this one). But i do miss the goofyness, and the ensembled cast of extras.all-in-all, if you're a fan of gwar to begin with then you'll like it. If this is you're new to gwar, if you just want to hear them rock out (and their music is great) then give this album a whirl, but to me; what made gwar, gwar, was the 'fun' that was in their earlier lyrics."
2,Highly disappointed,"When I first heard that Apocalyptica was recording ""Seemann"" I was incredibly excited about it. Now that I was able to hear it for the first time I was sadly disappointed. Apocalyptica does incredibly good, but the voice. Nina Hagen made me cry with her attempt to sing one of my favorite Rammstein songs. As a big fan of Rammstein i must admit that the work done by Apocalyptica is simply amazing. Why couldn't Nina Hagen just shut the hell up!!!???"
4,Who got the party? Who got the party? Who?,"This CD contains 3 remixes of the #6 hit ""Thieves in the Temple"". The first remix is an extended eight minute version of the song that is really great. The other two versions are mostly instrumental and are only moderately interesting."
3,"Great song, but lacking single","I like Thieves In The Temple, not one of my favorites, but still very strong, though I tend to feel a bit weary towards the Graffiti Bridge album.These mixes, however, are rather weak. I hate dubs, they always take whatever pieces from the vocal remix that weren't from the original recording and just make it twice as long, this dub is a classic example. With that said, there really isn't any reason why I should wish to listen to this single.I had gotten this out of impulse at a record store, and it wasn't a bad buy, but I can think of many more Prince singles that had much more effort put into them."
3,the key,"The Key, with Sophia Loren was a great 50's movie. Hopefully it will be released in the U,S."
1,orange flower water,received the item and the top was also loose as was on the rose water I ordered. The bottle leaked all over the packing and label was soaked.... very POOR quality control. this is two items I have recieved with the tops open... will never order from them again...........
3,Guess so,"Stinks, the smell doesn't last long . Seemed to keep the snakes away for a while but saw one about 6 weeks after putting it out. (Guess I'd know more if I were a snake). Cost is a little steep since have to reapply often."
1,Liquid Fence,"Totally does not work, I had sprayed the area twice and a snake came into the area and killed a little Wren and crushed the fledglings. I diluted it less than recommended."
3,"Good content, terrible format.","I first watched this debate about a month ago and I wasn't sure what I should think about it. The debate is great, but the format is terrible. There is no room for actual debate in this ""debate,"" and any actual debating is done by sneaking around the actual rules set at the start.That being said, I am re-watching it as I write this, and the content is much better than I remembered and I appreciate both Dawkins and Lennox. In fact, because of the debate format I'm not really sure that anyone won this ""debate,"" but rather that this was more of a conversation with lots of great content. If you like debates, you will probably like this dvd as long as you don't expect it to be a great debate. If you want a better debate with a revised format by the same people, seeGod on Trial."
4,petite dejeuner,This was better than I thought and yet it could have been MORE BETTER by having more time for open dialogue as opposed to the format used. Both men actually impressed me in their genuiness. If you watch this make popcorn and drink beer.
1,It's not a debate,"This ""debate"" was supported by a christian organisation. The format is like this:- A third person quotes a chapter of Dawkins' God Delusion- Dawkins has 5 minutes (he has to look at his stopwatch every time, seems to be very strict)- Then Lennox has his 5 minutes, telling his Christian views and generally absurd things (All of which can be falsified by those who read Dawkins book)After that, next chapter. So no chance for a discussion. There is NO debate, the format doesn't allow it. A scam"
5,A Blues Fan Delight,"Just purchased my fourth Ann Hampton Callaway album and this is my favorite yet. Having grown up in Chicago I developed a passion for the blues at a very early age. Callaway has chosen some amazing classics, thrown in her own ""Too White to Sing the Blues"", and delivered some original arrangements that blow me away. This CD will become a standard gift to my Blues loving friends who enjoy a fresh approach to a classic genre. So glad that I had a chance to see her perform in person!"
4,Blues in the Night,Great selection of music. Callaway performs with great respect for lyric and melody. Good listening.
2,No Go!!,"I've had this tablet for a week and haven't used it yet! After opening the box there was a red tag stating that if I had Windows ME I needed to go the kb gear website to download the driver. The website didn't have the driver. The customer support # was a personals hotline. AND there was no answer from the 5 emails sent to kb gear. I got this on clearancedog website at a low price. I guess it is as they say, ""you get what you pay for""."
1,Pablo won't work,"I was so excited when my Pablo Internet Edition arrived. My excitement quickly died when I discovered it is not compatible with Windows XP. I've written customer service hoping to be able to download the latest driver, but to no avail..."
1,Can you say virus,"my friend and I both purchased the Pablo Internet Edition from kbgear and the software has a virus called w95.cih.remnants that infects all .exe files and the virus is considered rare to get. and now of course we cannot get in touch with kbgear, none of the 800 #'s work, nor does the internet address, so until someone rectifies my problem, i would not recommend this product to anyone!!!!! i must say that if i wasn't having this problem and all was working well i would probably give it a great rating, but how will i ever know."
5,Does Work with Windows XP!!!! Read the directions!!!!,"This tablet is awesome for the money!! The presure sensitivity can be set in the control panel. I use Windows XP, and have had no problems at all. Just read the directions on the KB Gear website. Download any drivers there also."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS NT AUGGGGHHHH!,"Don't be a dummy like me, and order this product if you have Windows NT. (That rhymes by the way)."
4,Nice Touch,I have enjoyed using my graphics tablet and it works wonderfully on most my programs..Ive had a bit of a problem using it with Flash 4 tho. In drawing freehand vectors in Flash it seems to already have a starting point off the screen. The product DOES work wonderfully on my other graphic programs and the pressure sensitive pen is great!
2,Support for Windows 2000???,"All the reviews and comments on this product have been wonderful. The only problem is that I'm running Windows 2000 and for some strange reason this is the only Windows platform currently not supported.Someone else had commented on this and noted that they were able to get it to work. But, unfortunately, it appears that that person's review has been removed from Amazon.com. If someone out there can help, that would be awesome because the manufacturer's customer support line has been less than helpful."
1,garbage,Try getting tech support for this. Just visit IBM's site for an eye-opener. Even for a brand new product--out of the box-- there is no personal tech support--only tech notes. I am an experienced computer user and programmer and couldn't get this program to work.
4,Thank You Benjamin,"Apparently someone else had this guerrilla marketing strategy, but I'm very pleased to have coresponded w/ Benjamin about this matter. High five for taking the initiative and emailing me back."
2,"Book worth reading, but fire the marketer!","I'd have given this book a 4 or 5 star review, but the author has someone running all over recommending the book when it has no business being even tied to the book. Get the book, but write the author and tell them to rein themselves in: it's bad taste and lessens the importance of the work!"
5,GREAT item!,"FINALLY, quick and easy cole slaw. Easy to use, easy to clean, doesn't weight much, good price!"
1,"The motor is weak, this item is poorly made. Mine broke quickly.","I had mine for about 90 days before it broke. I used it about 5 times. I was slicing vegtables for maybe 10 minutes and after I turned it off on one bunch it never came back on. I took it apart and looked inside and the motor was very small. I am assuming it overheated like I have had happen with cheap 10$ blenders and the motor burned out, so I think it was poorly made and looking at the tiny motor and heap of plastic, probably 200% of what retail SHOULD be. I paid 40$ for this, I am not happy, I didn't register a warranty and don't see how I would keep trusting this company unless they offer to replace it when I call. Before it broke, it was a wonderful product and I am sad it seems like they have a monopoly on this design."
5,Professional Saladshooter,Very happy with purchase-a must for every cook. The price was very reasonable-very fast shipping. All and all just couldn't be happier. Thank You so much- hope to do business again.J.M.S.
2,"No where near ""Professional"" grade!","I have owned three of these now, and I cannot honestly recommend that you buy one unless you are not going to use it for anything but cole slaw. We used ours for a lot of things, but mainly large grated cheddar cheese projects. The first one held up for a fairly long time, and then the grater cone broke. We ordered another one, and then the motor burned out. We bought another, and the gears broke just after the warranty was up. We bought another because there was really nothing like the salad shooter, and the gears disintegrated just after the warranty was up again. I will never buy another. I think they have engineered it perfectly from a marketing perspective, so that it breaks just after the warranty is up. I know from studying quality management that this is more and more a common practice, and with today's statistical computer programs and engineering, quite easy to do."
4,Presto Salad Shooter from Amazon,"This product works great. We use it at least 2 times a week, many times more depending on what's cooking. My only 'complaint' is that I would like to see a dot of color on each attachment to let me know what to use for each job. If I am in a hurry, I have to stop and look for a minute to see if I am using the right one. Very easy to clean and to use."
2,Bigger is not better,"We bought this when our standard size salad shooter finally broke. We had hoped this 'Pro' model would fuction like the standard size, but be sturdier and made better. We were wrong. The 'Pro' model is the same plastic quality as the standard model, just bigger. In this case 'Bigger' is 'Worse'. It takes more room to store the tool; it is noiser, and, being bigger, there is more room in the shredder and the shredder feed for whatever you are shredding to get stuck, and hence, wasted. On the noise side, it is in the category of 'power tool' - not as loud as a skilsaw, but louder than a sabre saw, for example. This is a tool I regret buying and I will replace it soon - even before it breaks."
3,Presto Professional Salad Shooter,"I've only used it a couple times. It has a funny smell, I'm hoping that is just because it is new. It also seems to be struggling a bit, not as powerful or smooth as my older one that I used for years and ruined by trying to grate soap in it. Time will tell."
4,Presto Professional SaladShooter,"This is the second Professional Shooter I have purchased. The size, motor size, and grating/shredding capacity is what brings me back. I like to buy things in bulk and shred them myself and this does the job wonderfully. I love making my own cole slaw and this is so much better than busting my knuckles shredding the old fashioned ways. So thank you to Presto for this wonderful machine and I would whole heartedly recommend it!! The only reason I did not give a full 5 star (would have been 4.5 if that was possible) was because it is a little hard to hold and shred and the shooter doesn't shoot far so have to hold it over the bowl and press at same time can be a bit challenging. But overall it is the ideal shredder!"
5,Love this thing,We had a smaller Salad Shooter before but it broke (after many years). Had to have another one. The professional model looks like it can handle about anything.
5,Great Salad shooter!!,"I love the salad shooter, it makes slicing vegtables soooooooo easy!! My bother has one, when I tried it I told him I needed one!! I'm so glad I bought it!!"
5,Great product,This is my second salad shooter it is a great product. It is better to buy the big shooter instead of the smaller one.
4,Presto 02970 SalasShooter,Gave it only 4 stars because I have only use it once to slice potatoes. I loved it. So far so good! Let you know more after I used it on other things.
2,Minimally useful.,"If I hadn't already been using a full food processor to prepare salads, I might have liked this. It DOES make nice ""wavy cut"" cucumbers (as my grand kids call them). And it DOES a great job of grating raw cauliflower (the output looks just like white cheese gratings.)BUT, it also mangles salad onions, and takes way longer to do things than does the food processor. The big problem with the Shooter is that it rotates too slow for anything like lettuce. The output clogs up. Just not what I hoped for."
5,Handy! Handy! Handy!,"Put away the food processor... this is the best way to prepare salads, and chopped veggies. And, the cleanup is easy"
2,No Good,"This sounds like a freight train. I think i got ripped off. I used to have one I loved so ordered this one, wish I wouldn't have!"
1,Terrible,We used it about 5 times and are not satisfied. It takes up a lot of space and does not stay together when assembled. Not a well engineered product. We are now in the market for something that works.
5,Shreds Cheese!!,"The main thing I wanted this salad shooter for was shredding cheese, especially mozzerella. It does a great job, even on semi-soft cheeses. Also does a fine job chopping veggies."
4,Gets the job done,Sturdy but noisy. Easy to use but hard to store. Powerful with many attachments. Stains easily when grating sweet potatoes. Good job slicing cucumbers though the slices look like potato chips. Much easier than using manual slicer shredder.
5,salad shooter,I have been wanting this item for a while now and when I got it home and used it I was very pleased. It works very good and did most the work for me. The clean up was easy and I have used it quite a bit.
5,Love it!!!,Can't believe how much time this little thing saves me. I don't mind making some of those dishes that needed slices and shredding. Saves money on groceries since I can shred things myself. And it's easy to disassemble and clean.
4,Salad Shooter,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. I have used one myself since they first came out. But, not one of these super-dooper ones. I use the one I have very often and really do like it."
2,not what I expected,I purchased the salad shooter primarily to shred lettuce. The lettuce becomes mushy even when fresh lettuce is used. I have returned to shredding the lettuce with my hands and a knife. I also found that it did not work well for celery as it clogs up and does not always give nice slices.
3,presto salad shooter not impressive,"AFTER READING THE REVIEWS, I PURCHASED THE SALAD SHOOTER AND IT PERFORMED MISERABLY. THE POTATOES I TRIED TO RUN THROUGH IT WERE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT EASILY INTO THE FEED TUBE, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PEEL GOT STUCK EVERY TIME AND I HAD TO TAKE IT APART TO REMOVE A PEEL THE SIZE OF THE SIDE OF THE POTATO. I WAS SATISFIED WITH THE SLICES IT PRODUCED, BUT WAS DISMAYED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ASSEMBLE/DISASSEMBLE I HAD TO DO BETWEEN SLICING EACH POTATO."
3,It can be better,"This item is okay, but it really doesn't slice vegetables very well at all. It mashes most vegetables instead of slicing them. I went through the book twice and I am using the right blade cone, but I'm not very impressed with this item."
4,Huge Saladshooter...,"I have always wanted the larger saladshooter, as I bought the small one when it first came out. I know this will get a great workout."
2,Disappointed,"Expected better performance from this product. When slicing celery, half the stalk wraps around the outside of the slicer. The same thing happens with onions, seems to slice the inner part of the onion fine but the outer portion wraps around the outside of the slicer and I have to take the think apart and pull the pieces out before I can proceed with anything else. Works fine with vegetables like zuccini, squash and potatoes. But I purchased it so that I wouldn't have to do all the slicing and chopping to prepare salads so I am disappointed."
5,OWNED ONE YEARS AGO AND HAPPY TO KNOW IT WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE,I owned a Salad Shooter many years ago - I was very surprised to see that is was still in existence. The new one has many new features than the old one and I use it on an almost daily basis.
5,Great product,"So glad I bought the professional model of this Salad Shooter. I use it a lot for cheese and the motor is much stronger than the last, regular one I owned."
5,nice,"very nice appliance. works very well, makes my job a lot easier. the only down side is the clean up which is still not real bad."
2,Well engineered but highly time consuming to clean,"While the Presto 02970 is functionally well engineered, but the plastic material used absorbs food colors. For example, if you shred carrots, expect the unit to become dyed orange. 15 minutes of scrubbing with electric dishwasher powder and clorox was needed to clean it. And a trace of color steadfastly remains in the plastic. I cannot accept this major defect and misleading description on this website. Clean cooking tools are mandatory.I am going to a full stainless steel unit made by a different company. I have better things to do than scrub and clean."
4,I like it but doesn't shred like old model.,"I owned an older version of the Professional Salad shooter and used it often. My grater attachment was used so often, it actually broke in several places. So when it died I wanted a replacement. I bought it and was glad to see the power cord is actually attached. The old one was not so sometimes it would unplug. As a previous reviewer has said, using it to grate cheese is a definite benefit. The cheese is better freshly grated than prepackaged grated. I am disappointed when using it to grate vegetables. The vegies have to be scraped out rather than falling out as they are grated. I never had this issue with my old salad shooter. Attemting to make cole slaw with cabbage and carrots is a bit frustrating because I have to stop scrape out then grate more then scrape out and so on. Still it is much easier than using a hand grater. All in all, I would recommend this salad shooter because it does make food prep easier."
2,Not worth the money,"Basically, this unit is a slicer/shredder with no hopper. It works well for carrots and hard vegetables. It makes a mess of mushrooms, onions, squash, spring onions, and lettuce. Just get a food processor. Forget this thing."
2,Not overly useful,"I had a regular Salad SHooter for 20 years, and used it EXCLUSIVELY for grating cheese, since the opening to put food through the device was quite small. When it finally broke, I bought the Pro version because it looked like it had a much larger opening. Well, they say it will cut potatos, either in slices or crinkle cut. But you still have to cut the potato in half, so the chips you create are too small, in too thin. I just don't think there are enough uses, even for the larger food opening to make it worthwhile for most cooks. Unless you're making a salad for a dozen people, why pull out this machine to slice up 2 or three inches of a cucumber, or carrots.THe device still is great for shredding cheese, but not enough real world uses."
5,Saves my fingers,"IF you are like me and not a chef, using a knife can be daunting. I've cut myself a few times too.I bought this salad shooter and I am very happy with it. Easy to use and clean.I don't cut my fingers anymore making salads. This is a very goo thing."
4,Saladshooter Pro,"Good for making coleslaw for sauerkraut. Slices beets great. Motor is a little weak and does not shoot anything out, it plugs up a little but works OK if you don't push it too hard."
5,order,I was pleased with my purchase and I look to use it very frequently as my family loves cole slaw and I will be using it to make this item.
5,Very Happy,was a chrismas gift and works very well.I would buy it again for the rest family and friends or anybody who likes to cook
5,Love This Shooter!,"We have had the original salad shooter and the Pro Salad shooter. We used our first Pro Shooter for many many years until one day it refused to work any longer. We have also had the regular salad shooter. Trust me, don't waste your time or money on the smaller version. You will be frustrated with the small food shoot and less desirable cut of the grater. We especially love the Pro Salad Shooter for grating cheese. It does a perfect job in a manner of seconds. With the smaller salad shooter, you have to cut the cheese in smaller pieces and this really cuts into your prep time. Definitely buy the PRO shooter!"
4,No More Cheese-bow!,"I love freshly grated cheese, but my elbows sure don't. The bagged shredded cheese always kind of grossed me out since it was always hard and pasty looking. Anyway, this salad shooter is more like a cheese shooter for me. I don't have the room (or the money) for a big food processor, so this shooter really helps me out.The only other attachment I have used besides the shredder is the slicer, and it kind sliced my cucumber super thin. I don't really plan on using the other attachments anytime soon, so I can't base my review on them.Otherwise, buy this Salad Shooter if you suffer from the horrible Cheese-Bow!!!"
4,great for the job,"The shredder does a great job. Although it works well, it did not have blade that I needed. I had order it separately. I would recommend this to anyone planning to have more salads. It does a great job."
5,awesome,"much better performance then I expected from this product prompt delivery ,it is larger then the old one I had, makes the work much faster"
4,Makes life in the kitchen easy,"Works great. A must have for any one who seriously uses their kitchen, and cut lots of veggies.Four stars only because of the quality of the plastic. It gets stained easily by the food, and color is almost impossible to wash off. So from first use it already looked old."
5,Great product,"It met the needs required and it is easy to cleanup as the unit separates from the base. First time to have this item and it is actually fun to use. Yes, you need to cut the items into chunks however that is not a deterrent for me."
2,Some information was missing.,"The proper power supply was not mentioned on the package especially if the item shipped internationally. Because the electric current is different from U.S.A, In the USA they use 110 Volts but in my country they use 220 Volts. So i couldn't realize that before i use this item. I connected directly to 220 Volts which higher than the required. So please all information has to be given in the product details."
1,not worth a dime.,Completely a waste of you hard earned money. Does very little of what is promised. Save it and buy a good knife or mandolin.
2,Not what I expected,"This product was not what I expected. I wanted something to chop up salad for large groups, but I can chop the lettuce by hand quicker than I can get the salad shooter to do it. I use my food processor for the carrots, etc....I will be returning to Goodmans. As far as delivery, it was slow."
1,No voltage switch: 120V only!,"This device does not work with 220V. A voltage transformer must be purchased if ordering from 220V Countries.My Presto device burst with sparks and was about to fire up when I switched it on in Singapore.More information on this issue please, both Presto and Amazon!You guys place these items on the global market: this is very relevant information to your non-US customers. It must be made very clear that this appliance only works on 120V. It's not equipped with voltage converter and a separate transformer must be used in conjunction with the device."
1,Very unhappy,My mom bought this under my name and she is almost 70 and it is very hard for her to use. She wants to return it.
5,great little gizmo!,"I own a version of this that I bought probably 15 years ago. It still runs perfectly. I love having it when I have to slice or grate anything hard. It does a beautiful job with carrots in particular...makes them really pretty for salads. It's small (doesn't take much space in the kitchen), easy to clean and fun to use. My ONLY problem with it is that I sometimes forget that I even have it and don't use it as often as I could. This thing really works!!! If mine ever broke, I would be sure to get another one to replace it...I like it that much."
5,Presto Professional Salad Shooter,"It works much better than I anticipated. Parts are quite sturdy and easy to insert, take apart and clean. The only thing I've found so far is the slicing cones included shred lettuce and peppers a little finer than I'd like. But for a very reasonable cost, Presto offers a 'super slicing' cone which I intend to order.All in all, I definitely am pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to avoid the time-consuming chore of hand chopping.It should be a welcome addition to my kitchen for many years to ccme."
5,Bigger than I thought,This looked just like my old one I wore out. The professional grade is larger but I love it. I can sherd larger pieces of cheese as well as potatos. The cone funnle attachment directs the output right where you want it.
3,Quick Review,"I've read a lot of reviews on this product, so here it is short and sweet. This thing is definitely loud. Do you need ear plugs? I don't think so. I use it primarily to shred cheese, and it can handle 2 lbs in under 30 seconds. It sure beats shredding manually, if you can put up with the volume for a half a minute."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought it in November for Thanksgiving, and it was amazing. I was so impressed that it allowed me to make some salad in 3 minutes so I recommended it to many of my friends. However, last night I wanted to make some cucumber salad and that was only the second time I used this salad shooter, but the power switch didn't work, maybe it got stuck or something. I liked it so much I thought I shouldn't give up so easily, well, this morning I tried it again, and went through the instructions book and still couldn't figure out why it doesn't work anymore. I'm so sad that I have to return it, :( it still looks brand new, but just doesn't work."
2,Like the smaller Presto slicer/shredder BETTER!!,"I have the smaller Presto Salad Shooter and LOVE IT!! Bought this larger one thinking it would be better and have a larger capacity. WRONG!! I don't know if I just got a bad one or what. But the main thing I like to make is cole slaw with the shredder cone on my smaller Presto, well this one DOES NOT shred cabbage. It seems to have less blades on the shredder cone than the one from the smaller Presto. Don't know if that's the problem or what, but cabbage just hung up in chamber."
2,It functions good for a portable unit,The cones are sharp with many to choose from. The locking part of the 2 part pusher is annoying. Some food slices can get stuck in between parts without being ejected nearly wrecking the tool. My comparison to a popular stand mixer attachment this portable product is difficult to use and underpowered. Its past the return policy and I'll just use it for softer veggies and maybe try some chilled cheese grating. The plastic stains gross with carrots. Otherwise the product is good and functional if you have nothing to compare it to.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Although I use a salad shooter daily and love it's performance, this model is too large and too noisy. I wished www.amazon.com would include the extra blades with the smaller Presto Salad Shooter/Slicer #02910."
2,Disappointed,"I should have listened to other reviewers. Celery is a mess with no ""pretty"" pieces coming out.. at all. Even with the thickest slicing tool they got mangled. Romaine lettuce came out ""pre-chewed""... not attractive. Even carrots did not come out as expected... thought medallions... got random. Will most likely only use this for soups or stews.... if at all."
4,"Presto Pro SaladShooter, better than original","I had an early salad shooter and loved it. When using the new pro version, I realized how much better it could get. Yes, the salad shooter is missing a fine grater cone, but the new version is much easier to turn on and off. Sounds strange, but the little flip switch versus a sliding switch made a world of difference to me.I love this device and use it for cheese, vegetables and fruit.Watch those stringy vegetables such as celery...your knive will work better on those.Cheese is best shredded when frozen. It doesn't stick to the cone as much.Anyone with carpal tunnel will sing the praises of this device."
5,Awesome,"I love my salad shooter. My friend had one and once I used hers I knew I had to have one. I am on an all raw organic food eating program so I was sooooo glad to see I could buy the organic vegetables and cut, slice, and shred them myself for a fresh salad."
4,Great for grating hard cheese quickly,"Great for grating cheddar cheese, and veggies. Had an old on for years. Till it finally died. Had it at least 8 years before this one. So got the Pro model this time and it is worth the extra money. Capacity is bigger with a stronger motor, highly recommend."
5,Presto Salad Shooter is awesome!!,"I purchased this for a gift for my wife and I, and we love it! It's so much faster then a mandolin slicer and cleaner as well. We eat a lot of salads and fresh veggies daily so the Salad Shooter is the perfect fit for us! It's very powerful and easy to use, and does so much in such a very short amount of time. It's just a wonderful product, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,Salad Shooter,"I had owned this in the past, but when it broke, I bought a far more expensive ""food processor"" thinking it would be better. It was a huge disappointment, so I purchased a new Salad Shooter, and am very pleased with it's performance--just as it had been in the past."
4,great invention,"I love it! It's easy to put together and take apart, goes into the dishwasher for easy cleaning. About the only drawback I can say from my use is cucumbers slice better if you leave the skin on them. It saved me so much time slicing potatoes for a big scalloped potato dish I made recently. We use it all the time for grating cheese. Great value for the price."
5,Great Gift,"My aunt who is known for her gourmet food and elabrate parties loves and swears by her Presto Salad Shooter. She bought one 10 or 15 years ago and finally asked me to get her a new one for her birthday because she had worn out the blades. The motor still worked fine after so long which is amazing! I had the hardest time finding a new one at our local store, but found this one at Amazon. I found that it is better and cheaper than the anything else I was able to find. Also, this one comes with an extra blade that my aunt said she didn't have with her original. As excited as she was about this product, I am surprised they aren't easier to find at local stores. I am now asking my husband to get me one for Christmas!"
5,A great helper in kitchen - cutting vegetables,I love this .. useful for shredding onion/carrots cuts beans/tindora in round/cylindrical shape. Useful with cabbage too.. I also ordered the special accessory - fine and super shred cones .. great one
5,Great for Chow Chow,"SaladShooter worked really well grinding chow-chow ingredients -- cabbage, bell peppers and onions using the Super Shred Cone (item # 09944) with larger cutting holes than the cone that came with the original purchase.I would like to see the Super Shred Cone be offered without the long slicing feature since we needed to manually dice a few of the shredded pieces that pushed thru the long slicing part of the cone.Considering the inexpensive cost and how seldom we'll use it for making chow-chow I would definitely recommend the product to anyone."
4,Great addition to my kitchen,"This is an awesome device for popping out fairly even slices to be dried in my dehydrator. Also great for getting large amounts of veggies shredded or sliced for soups, stews and stir frys...."
2,Not want i expected,"Do not really like this product. It pretty much grinds everything up, not really slicing. Should have sent back but time got away from me to do so."
2,"Presto 02970 Professional SaladShooter Electric Slicer/Shredder, White Presto",Not Sharp!!!It is just not sharp enough for cutting. Really not sure why.There is really not much more to say about this.Was very disappointed.
1,Not what i thought it would be!,"I had the old salad shooter years ago and loved it. So since it has been long gone I had wanted another for years and finally decided to get another one. So I chose the professional series one. I am not sure if the blades are not sharp enough or what but it doesn't slice very well. I tried both sets that came with it and got the same results, roughly sliced. The veges were fresh too! So everything that comes out isn't cut nicely, but very roughly which leads me to beleive the blades are dull and not sharp enough to cut the veges right, so I threw it in the garage where all my unwanted items go! I'll just use my good ole knife as I always have.I don't recommend buying this unit as you to will probably find the same results."
3,A little disappointed in overall outcome,"Pros:This product does the job: it chops and grates fast. It works well for soups and stir fries. The device is messy, but cleans up easily. It's also easy to take apart and put together. There is a (1) thin slicer, (2) thick slicer, (3) decorative slicer, and a(4) thick grater.Cons:The slices look ugly like a chop more fitted for a school cafeteria than a nicely decorated table. It has many parts that require storage space. There is no fine grate attachment like for fine grating cheese. It stains from veggies (like carrots), but I noticed that other vegetables' acids often clean the stains off, for example the orange from the carrot stains went away after I grated cooked beets."
4,Presto Salad Shooter,"I have not had it very long , however it seem's to work fine. Potatos doe's great, shredding cheese and hash browns great. Chopping so so."
3,just OK,"Was going to buy a Food processor then went with this because it has different blades sizes. Don't think it is worth its price. Blades are not that sharp, so may not slice tomatoes or mushy items. Also have a hard time slicing onions of you don't take out a couple of outer layers. Thin slices way too thin. Just an ok product"
3,Beware if international,"I love love this machine, but as it's output is only 120V it was not compatible with Australian outlets (240V). Easily fixed with an adaptor I got online, just a hassel if you're expecting it to work straight from the box."
3,"Does the job, will it last?","It shreds and slices O.K. It is made of very cheap plastic, looks like Product of China. I don't know how long it will last."
2,super shooter,"What a great machine, saves times and beats grating with your fingers. smooth action with choices of blades, great with hard foods. plus electric."
1,"Don't bother buying, because you will return","This salad shooter thing was terrible! I tried it and it took me longer to make the salad with that then it would have without it. You can only cut certain types of vegetables and fruit and 1/2 of what you cut gets stuck inside the machine. When I went to clean it, 1/2 my salad was in the machine and was wasted. It also made a funny burning smell when I put something in to cut. I would not suggest this to anyone. If you didn't return it you would put it in the back of a closet and throw out in a few years."
4,My opinion & comment,"Does what is advertised. The motor could be ""stronger"".Also, I would have purchased another item recently ( a crepe maker) BUT your opening page claims FREE shipping for orders over $25. Th amt was $29.95 but when I wen to check out the shipping stated $7.99, so I cancelled the order."
2,This book is like a limp handshake.,"This is the first book I've read by Ms Williamson. I'm not likely to read another. Right from the beginning it had me feeling blah. This is just another book telling me what I'm doing wrong with my life, but it's okay I can move past it. ??? A dull book with nothing new to say. At times it felt whiney, if that makes any sense. Disappointing."
5,The best way to review the Course in Miracles,"First, I want to make it clear that:The Course is NOT JUST READING MATERIAL.You find something that upsets you and see it as not real. If a person upsets you, you see them as ""watching from the kingdom"" or ""responding to an insane idea, but totally blameless.""You respond to lack by reaffirming that in spirit, you are taken care of, and this world is an illusion.The above is for doing, not for reading and saying ""I know stuff, therefore I'm new agey"". Granted, Marianne does not state the above. She glorifies the body, time, and the ""toys of earth"" instead.So why did I give her 5 stars? Oh that's easy,I like to open her books and use them to remind me of the Course. She says the opposite of the Course on nearly every page, and it's an easy way to review principles to students in my groups because she condenses those as if I just pulled out a summary of the material."
3,Probably Better off with the Text Version,"My review is truly biased toward my personal needs-first off. With subject matter in regards to change, I would rather prefer cold hard facts.Williamson's voice in this recording is soothing as she addresses the audience. However, the over-flowery content in this book leads me to sleep rather than pay attention. Williamson sounds more like a meditation instructor than an expert of metaphysical studies. However, the text probably has better meaning if you read the book instead.This book is more for the emotive idealist. Sounds soothing but not enough hard facts for people with harder hearts like myself."
2,Book is wonderful...vendor...NOT SO MUCH!,"I have to say I agree with all the POSITIVE reviews on Ms. Williamson's book. Just please don't get it for $3.00 if you BELIEVE it's new. That's how I ordered it. Was said it was a new book HOWEVER, when I got it, someone had already high lighted so many of the paragraphs in the book already!If you want to try to pass off a book as NEW....don't highlight your favorite sections and pass it off to others as something it's not...especially considering the SUBJECT of the book!"
4,The Gift Of Change: Spiritual Guidance for a Radically New Life,"If you like Marianne Williamson, you won't be disappointed. Once again, her words remind us to live in love rather than fear and teach how each of us can make a difference in changing our world. Insightful and inspiring."
5,The Gift of Change by Marianne Williamson,"I purchased this book for my Husband and he is going to write a review.I found this book to be all I expected it to be. I am presently doing a program called ""A Course in Miracles"" and this book relates directly to it. The Author brings it to life in a down to earth way. I have already read the book once and I am halfway through it again. It is deep but very meaningfull while the Course in Miracles is very difficult to wade through. This puts it in a very practical way that I can relate to in my life. I would strongly recommend it to those who are searching for a closer relationship with God."
5,Embracing change,The author has a unique way of putting out thoughts so the reader can think about them. It is done in a way that can be done at different times and a little at a time if preferred. Nice writing style. Another must read for another truly profound and life changing book is The Self Love Principle by Debra Gangale.
1,Doesn't Do Justice to A Course in Miracles,"Loyal fans of Marianne will no doubt be ga ga over this book, which probably accomplishes its purpose: to make them feel good. That however, is not the purpose of A Course in Miracles, which this book purports to be about. It is not being A Course ""fundamentalist"" to point out that Jesus is telling us something unique in the Course, something that is not necessarily what everything else is saying. He is not merely trying to make us feel good in the dream (which he describes this world as) but to get us to choose between the dream and reality, which he bids us to awaken to with Him. ""The Gift of Change"" totally misses the point. There's nothing wrong with feeling good, but there are plenty of other spiritual paths available that can accomplish that. A Course in Miracles is a lifelong spiritual path for those who are determined to go home, and ""The Gift of Change"" is for people who want to feel better about, and stay in, a dream that doesn't really exist."
5,The Gift of Change,"I loved the book because of the uplifting, loving approach Marianne Williamson gives to her writing. Her philosophies span all faiths and zezo in on what unites us as people. We decide how events impact us - that is her message!"
4,Self help book,One of Marianne's better books. She uses numerous stories about herself for examples. Being a guy it seemed like on several occasions she was blaming men for all her ills.
4,Not your everyday koto album,"This isn't really an album of traditional Japanese music, though the koto is the quintessential Japanese instrument--more recognizable and associated with Japan than the shakuhachi flute.Elizabeth Falconer opens the album ""Deep Pool"" with a very traditional-sounding Japanese composition but then moves into more expressionistic, meditative and modern compositions that showcase the koto but have little to do with Japanese music. That's what makes this album unique. Falconer takes full advantage of her skill with the koto and creates water sounds, bird sounds, and some very nice original compositions.This is just what you'd like to have being played while having a massage or while meditating or just relaxing. If you are a massage therapist, you will really want this album. If you like something to chill out the kids before naptime or to go to sleep by, you might find that falling into ""Deep Pool"" is just the thing. I like it a lot for creating a restful mood."
5,Unarguably the best DM song produced,"Buy it! If you haven't heard ""Sea of Sin"" or ""Happiest Girl"" then you are missing out! True DM fans wont be dissapointed."
4,Insightful and Inspiring,This collection of stories will inspire you. These people come from all walks of life and there's something here for everyone.
4,Complexity Confounds Even Great Minds,"This Book is a long needed guide to self examination and that self-same ""Daily Conversion"" the Catholic Faith calls for and demands of all believers. After a dozen years in formal, University study I found this book a refreshing cup of cool water. ""Living Water"" as it were! We are not unlike a colony of ants...rushing about our tasks and duties in life. Unfortunately, those tasks and duties we ""think"" are so very important often times rob us of the very joy of life that God intends we enjoy. Everything we undertake in life is, in the final analysis a matter of choice and this book helps us to reprioritize our choices. It helps us, ""To keep our heads, when all about us seem to be losing theirs"" Deacon Rev Lawrence L. Ruehlen,EdD."
1,A picture is worth a thousand words.,"I've read ""Your Money or Your Life"" and was looking for another book to inspire me to take the next steps. When I saw the cover of this book, it just struck me as strange; I've been looking at buying a canoe, for exercise and contemplation, and although I find wood canoes beautiful, decided on a fiberglass model after seeing the price on the wood models($3000 and up). The incongruity of the pricey canoe, and the message the book was trying to convey seemed disingenuous to me.Having never read a single word of the book, I couldn't say whether the book would have inspired me or not, but the choice of the cover just turned me off, and I continued my search else where.Now having read J. Peppers review stating how the author found her simple life, while her husband continued selling million dollar homes, I have to say the choice of cover said much about this book with out me having to read a single word."
5,Extremely inspiring,"This is the perfect book for anyone out there who thinks that there must be more to life. Buy this book and you will be inspired to make the changes that you know, in your heart, are the right changes to make. Written with an easy-to-read tone, Choosing Simplicity introduces you to over 200 people who have decided that life has more to offer than commuting and paying credit card bills. Their stories will inspire you, as they did me, to prioritize and ""clean house."" The best thing about this book is that it gives you so many different ways to make your life simple. There isn't just one plan. The various stories allow you to pick and choose what works for you. I enjoyed this book so much that I've purchased it for 3 different people."
5,Bounce is Bon Jovi's Best Yet!,"As someone who has every Bon Jovi CD since Slippery When Wet, plus Jon's 2 solo CDs, I can honestly say this album is truly the best yet. With hard rocking tunes, beautiful ballads,and a couple of story telling songs, it shows the maturity and quality of experienced musicians and song writers - which is a nice change in this era of dime a dozen boy bands.""Everyday"" has the fist pumping quality of ""its my life"" of the preceding CD ""Crush"" and ""Misunderstood"" has the smooth beat and lyrics reminiscent of the Goo Goo Dolls, while ""open all night"" has the Bon Jovi power ballad feel for all its fans, while Richie's guitar in this song brings flashbacks of Eric Clapton.They debuted a #2 on the charts, and while one critic said that Bounce had more cheese than a deli, this deli has been open for 20 years, with enough customers to fill Times Square."
5,Bon Jovi Bounces in,Bounce is an awesome CD! Bon Jovi really hit the road running I can say the first time I heard Undivided a tribute to the victims of 9/11 it brought a chill. I hear alot of the familiar Bon Jovi sound with a new twist. If you love Richie you will love the album.
5,Bon Jovi's Back Once Again,"Bon Jovi is back and better than ever. This album is easy listening but still rock. My favorite songs on it are ""You Had Me From Hello,"" ""All About Loving You,"" and ""Undivided."" The songs are so good that you dont even have to skip any of them. I've listened to ""Bounce"" a million times already and I love it! I definitely recommend buying this album."
5,Bounce is Best!!!!,"""Bounce"" is another of Bon Jovi's best.If I had to choose my favorites are ""Everyday"" and ""Love me back to life"", but the whole album is fantastic. A must have for any Bon Jovi fan."
5,Bounce Really Rocks!,"I absolutely love Bounce!! From Track 1 ""Undivided"" all the way through to Track 12 ""Open All Night""!! There is a great balance of ""Heavy"" Rocking songs and ballads! Any Bon Jovi fan will love this album!! Go get it now!! ..."
3,Bon Jovi Fanatic...........,"I am a huge Bon Jovi fan and more importantly I perform Bon Jovi music throughout North America with my band. I really love the music and the direction the band took with the new album. I am however, concerned with Jon's vocals. They are weak on numerous tracks, most notably on ""All About Loving You"" and ""Love Me Back To Life"" where he 'lifts his vocals' on the 2 bridges. I was very pleased with the stories that the songs told on this album particularly in ""Right Side Of Wrong"". Richie is sounding better than ever and David's distinctive Yamaha sound is at its best, although they were used sparingly on this album.Overall though, I am hugely pleased with the album. As I am a musician, and model myself after Jon, I am always happy when they release a new album. I have no doubts that this one will topple the 100 Million Mark. A feat any other band could only dream of. Jon, quit smoking and get back to the sound that made you famous. Love ya' guys.......G!"
4,A wonderfull come back,It's a wonderfull cd of the group. They come back with rock and roll like the beggining and it's extra. For all the fan of guitare and rock.There's nice balade and too wonderfull rock songs.Everybody will like it!!!!!
5,Very much for the 35 and older set,"I think this cd is great. I am in the 34 and holding group that grew up during the Slippery and Jersey days. It is hard to beat songs like ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Bad Medicine"", but the songs on ""Bounce"" are in the same category of classic rock songs. My favorite tracks are ""Undivided"", ""Everyday"", ""The Distance"" and ""Hook Me Up"". Richie's guitar playing is superb on these tracks. I think this album proves that these guys are working just as hard today as they did in the mid 80's to deliver what the fans want - rock music that is upbeat and true to the jovi spirit."
3,Bounce Review,"Bon Jovi's new album, ""Bounce,"" is a good album, but not their best. My favorite songs on the album are Everyday, The Distance, You Had Me From Hello and Bounce. I personally took more of a liking to the demos/b-sides for the album. It's a well written album just not in the tastes of a person like myself. Some of the other songs are starting to grow on me though. It seems to have the same effect as Def Leppard's ""Slang"" album, which was a well-written departure from their usual sound and also took me a while to get used to. Maybe a couple more listens will do the same for ""Bounce."""
5,Bon Jovi Does It Again,Like Holy Moly and a Pocket Full of Posie! Rockin'!!!! Agan and again. Great album. I have listen to it everyday at least 4 times a day! The best!!! True!
3,NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST,A GREAT ALBUM BUT NOT THE BEST THEY HAVE EVER DONE. I LOVE THEM AND I ALWAY WILL BUT I FEEL TOO MANY OF THE SONGS SOUND A LIKE.
4,You'll be Bouncin' to the beats!,"The best way to describe Bounce is an album that is easy to listen to. It has a nice mix of the 9/11 tribute (Undivided), but also some great rock tunes to it (Hook Me Up and Everyday are my favs), along with a few ballads (You Had Me From Hello). It is SO much better than Crush, but there's a big part of me that wants them to get back to their classic sound that I love so much... But thats ok -- I'll get over it! Bounce is full of beautiful lyrics and great sounds that can appeal to a wide variety of listeners, whether they are new fans or old."
5,"Bon Jovi Rocks again with ""Bounce""","For all of you long time Bon Jovi fans - and those new to the family - our Jersey boys have done it again! From touching on our post 9/11 emotions with ""Undivided,"" through the in-your-face lyrics of both ""Everyday"" and ""Bounce,"" to the another moving ballad with ""All About Lovin' You,"" Jon, Richie, Tico and David (along with help from Hugh) don't disappoint. ""The Distance"" has rocking guitar licks and powerful lyrics, while the story of ""Right Side of Wrong"" follows strongly in the footsteps of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Blaze of Glory."" Give this album a listen. You won't be sorry!"
5,listen to bounce everyday,"Bon Jovi's new cd bounce rocks!! It has variety from heartfelt to uplifting. One of my favorites is all about loving you. If you haven't bought this cd yet, don't waste any more time. Get it now!"
3,JBJ in half way decent album shock..!,..Been a while since I listened to BJ ..they've done not very much for me since 'Slippery' apart from 'Its my life' of course ...weeelll...'Undivided' that kicks the album off is a real stomping mother of a track with a heavied-up riff & lyrically interesting comment on 9/11. Things go slowly downhill from there on in.. although 'Everyday' and 'Misunderstood' are decent tunes the Nu-metal influences on 'Everyday' in particular just sound ultimately incongruous..this just sounds like a Creed track...first of the ballads 'joey' track 4 is a big turn off...why do the guys let JBJ get away with this maudlin rubbish...'Hook me up' track 7 is also littered with unnecessary Linkin' Park isms....all in all the best BJ album I've heard for a long time ..but really thats not saying a great deal..
2,It won't keep me bouncing for long,"Bon Jovi one of many long time rockbands are back again with Bounce a album that includes some classic rock tracks and some ballads as usual. Jon and Richie are writing most songs as usual but notable is that the Swede Andreas Carlsson from Cheiron is appearing on a few one's too. The Cheiron guys wrote the huge 2000 summer hit ""It's my life"" we all remember. However these songs are not as good ""Misunderstood"" and ""All About Lovin' You"" are songs that got some airplay but we later tend to forget very quicky. ""Everyday"" ""Hook me up"" and ""Bounce"" stand for the rockier tracks and songs like ""Right Side Of Wrong"" and ""Joey"" are notable ballads. But these songs are far from classics like masterpiece ""Living on a prayer"" or power ballad ""Always"". These songs will get played for a while to later be forgotten. As much as i like Bon Jovi i have to admit it was quite some time now they made any special albums, each album have some nice one's but no classics."
5,Bounce-Bon Jovi,"I have always been a Bon Jovi fan--since their first album--I have never been disappointed! This CD is AWESOME! Bon Jovi showed that they can still rock, even with their slower songs. While ""Everyday"" and ""Bounce"" are more of what will probably be released on radio airwaves, ""Hook Me Up"" is just as great. Looking for Bon Jovi to show their more mellow side too?? ""You Had Me From Hello"" and ""All About Lovin' You"" are the best songs. I want to say even though Bon Jovi wrote ""Undivided"" more for them as being Bon Jovi, it expresses some feelings on how we all felt on September 11, 2001! Thanks and congrats to the guys in Bon Jovi for all the work in making this CD!! Your fans will love it!!"
2,Bounce,"Bon Jovi has streamlined into yet another genre of music. There latest release ""Bounce"" is a far cry from previous Bon Jovi Albums.Jon and writing partner Richie Sambora have written less songs together on this album than any other Bon Jovi albums in the past and it shows. There is a complete lack of any aggressive guitar playing on this record. It is clear that jon needs to get off his ego trip and realize that he and his fans suffer without Richie's musical contribution.(The bands fan club used to be :""Back stage with Bon Jovi"") Now it is simply: ""Back stage with Jon Bon Jovi) Jon has teamed with the likes of Billy Falcon on 3 of the tracks as well as Desmond Child on several others.Jon : IF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT !ie;Slippery when wetBillChicago"
4,Bon Jovi has done it again,"Unbelievable. This CD speaks from the heart and soul. from track one to the last, i wanted to play it over and over. Bon Jovi is bouncing and will always be at the top."
5,Bon Jovi at his best!,"This is one very good album! I bought it the weekend after it came out and have listened to it many times since then...I really love the whole CD. It definitely has what you have come to expect from a Bon Jovi CD: great rock songs, some love ballads, and this one also has a couple of songs that hearken back to the old storytelling tradition. I really like all the songs on this CD, so it is very hard to pick a favorite, but if I had to, it would probably be either Undivided or You Had Me From Hello. In summation, I will just say that anyone who is a Bon Jovi fan should give this one a try...even if you weren't all that thrilled with Crush, since I think this album far surpasses Crush!"
5,JON & THE BOYS BOUNCE BACK!,"There is not a lot I can say about Bounce except to say that I love it! It's been a while since I have wanted to listen to an album all the way through, but I did with this one, and every song is a winner. So far, my favorite songs include Everyday, Joey, All About Lovin' You, Right Side Of Wrong, and You Had Me From Hello. I just hope that you will enjoy Bounce as much as I have. This is an album that is destined to be a classic!"
4,Great way of bouncing..,"I was abble to listen to this cd before it's release. When I firts listened to it, I didn't like it that much. But this happens to me with every Bon Jovi cd, so I decided to go and listen to it again.On the second run, I realised this was a great Bon Jovi album. The firts song, Undivided, is one of the most amazing Bon Jovi song ever, and the greatest album opener since Hey God, from These Days.The rest of the album is great. The Distance, Misunderstod (which is like a flashback to Jon's Destination Anywhere) and the great Bounce are old Bon Jovi at is best.Is a great way to continue 2000's Crush. Most Bon Jovi fans will love this cd.I recommend this one. Is a must have to any Bon Jovi or music fan."
4,Bounce,"This CD is well crafted but too short.There are some songs would become a hit such as :Everyday, All about loving you, You had me from Hello.My personal fav is The Distance."
4,Wild And Balladic,"""Wild In The Streets"" Bon Jovi is back in 2000s form. ""The Distance"" is similarly styled as Creed's ""My Sacrifice"" but Bon Jovi's done better. ""Hook Me Up"" is another excellent ""wild track"" and classic Bon Jovi rocker ""Bounce"" makes me roar like I was in 1985. The only trouble is the ballads such as ""Joey"", ""All About Loving You"", ""Right Side or Wrong"" are so confusingly similarly styled to each other, though all are nice in themselves. Recommended for wide range of pop hard rock fans."
5,this is such an awesome album,"this album is great. it is not fair, that bonjovi is not getting the airplay they deserve. i really love undivided. it really hits home(about 9-11) a must have album. bonjovi never dissappoints. been a fan since 1985."
3,Bon Jovi Comes Down Hard On This Dope LP,"Well me and my homie went out and got this new joint right after school today, first day it came out. Starting off this album is pretty solid with the dope cut ""Undivided"". The album continues to not dissapoint, coming down super dope on the southern sounding ""Misunderstood"". All in all this album is worth the monay and is a excellent foray into the world of rap/rock for my man Jon Bon. PEACE!"
5,Hell yeah Bon Jovi,"Bon-jovi is so awesome, I have just recently went to one of their concerts at mohegan sun. Awesome. Ever since that night i have tried to order all of their cds. Jon is so cute even though he could be my father. People all around just buy the cds they are awesome.Danielle"
5,Incredible!!!!,"This album is a must have for all Americans. It has such an amazing message of resiliency in not only people, but in the American Spirit. We have all been touched by 9/11 and it will forever live in our minds and hearts. BOUNCE truly does deliver a message of just that ... bouncing back and showing the world that we are UNITED! It is definitely worth adding to your music collection no matter what your taste in music is"
5,BON JOVI SAVES THE WORLD,"Bon Jovi save the world with this much needed Album, injecting some real talent back into the music industry. Personally I have grown tired of the engineered ""pop"" style that has been slowly taking the music world. Bon Jovi literally smash this apart with energising songs like ""Everyday"" and ""Bounce"". The great thing about these guys is they continue to bring out great original music and nearly everyone is or will become one of the alltime classics. This album is a must for anyone, you can crank it up, or just chill out, its up to you."
5,Bounce - a fan's review,I bought the new Bon Jovi album with great excitement and I was not disappointed. The album has a good mix of rock and ballads and the band sound as good as ever. Can't wait for the supporting tour...........
5,Awesome Album!,"This album is a must buy! It has great song writing and is up- lifting, yet it has some heart put into it also. I listen to it over and over again in my car, with songs like Everyday, Undivided, Misunderstood, The Distance and All about loving you, I never will get tired of hearing them. Bon Jovi has proved once again that their music will never die!"
5,Bounce Rocks,"Jon Bon Jovi and the Band have scored another hit record with the latest CD entitled Bounce. They have included an awesome mixture of rock and ballads in the 12 tracks. Once again the storytelling by Jon and Richie is right on track. Every listener needs to check out the tracks called ""You Had Me At Hello"" and the ""Right Side Of Wrong"". Both are sure to become classics!"
2,Bon Jovi now #2 on my chart,"After several listens trying to get into the new Bounce CD, I have to say, I'm disappointed. It starts out really rocking & I'm getting excited & impressed, then I lose it. It's on the boring, repetitive side. Did you guys not have more material than this to choose from in the 2 yr. wait? ""Everyday"" is the best on this record."
5,Lol...why do you ask ?,"I think BOUNCE rocks!I LOVE BON JOVI , but it really doesn't mean I should love everything they do , but even so , I love 99% of the things they do .I think BOUNCE is a great rock album , which us ,all the fans , have been looking for a while. I absolutely love ALL the album!! I really is very hard for me to stop listening it or choose a song because all the album is great!!I love the guitar work Richie did , and all the changes in the voice that Jon makes in each song. It really makes me feel the songs and I guess Bon Jovi is one of the few bands that really make you feel the song and they transmit their feelings through them.SO KEEP YOUR HARD WORK GUYS! , AND NEVER GIVE UP !!!!!!"
5,Great Bon Jovi Music,"Bounce the new bon jovi cd in a few words amazing!!!if i was to compare this bon jovi cd to any other artist i could not honestly it is in my opinion the best bon jovi album ever bounce is like the beggings of bon jovi, it resembles the two first bon jovi albums . a little more rock and guitar than the latest really truely amazing! Bon Jovi's Bounce definatly Bounced on the charts with a vengence and will stay there for a while still to come garantee!!!!"
4,Bounce back with Bon Jovi,The new album Bounce by Bon Jovi will do just that; Bounce Bon Jovi back into the spotlight. This album is full of songs of courage and triumph. The lyrics are inspirational and the music will keep you rocking all day long. The album tells a story of sorts over time.
4,Not Their Best....,"I am the hugest Bon Jovi fan ever, and I purchased their new album, and I don't think it's their best work ever. I mean, it is good, moving, etc., but I think that's it's not their best. :) I will still listen to it, learn it, etc., being the fan that I am!!!"
5,Bon Jovi kicks butt,"I just love this album. ""Bounce"" is the awesome album. If your not a Bon Jovi fan, you are missing out what the album sounds like. It's the best Rock and Roll album ever. For you all like Ballads, Bon Jovi put some really good Ballads on ""Bounce"". I'm not a shame about this album. Bon Jovi did a very good job making the album ""Bounce"". I hope it gets to number 1 on the Charts. Bon Jovi kicks butt!!!!!!"
4,Bon Jovi fanatic review,"I have been a lifelong fan of Bon Jovi , This album sounds slighly different to some of there others. Although some songs do sound similar to recent songs on the last one.I must admit that it took me a bit longer to get into this album , but after a few weeks of listening to the album its grown on me and is great."
4,GREAT BUT NOT 5 STARS,"This album is the hardest album since 7800 Farenheit and I love that but there are TOO many ballads and mid-tempo songs that bring down the harder songs. To me its a great but typical Jovi album and I DO recommend buying it if you are a Jovi fan for Undivided, Bounce, Everyday and the Distance alone!!!!"
5,Bon Jovi still Rocking,More GREAT songs - a few heavier than ever - but still a few great new ballods - and Richie out did himself with the guitar parts - great orchestra inclusion
3,Rox!!,"Jovi's new one rox like hiz older ones - he's back!!If you like older Jovi, you won't go wrong with newer Jovi. These Jersey kids sound fresher than ever, and they have the potential to be around a long, long time.Jovi's voice is a little less gravelly these days, he sounds (and looks!) like a young kid ready to tear up the world. He sez his band is just getting started, and based on what I've heard of ""Bounce,"" I tend to believe him!!Well, if you like beautiful love ballads mixed with Kix-like metal, don't pass this disc up, it's got pretty much any style you could want.If you like Jovi, you'd better ""bounce"" to the the record store and git it today!L8TR!!Peace in '02....."
5,ANOTHER AMAZING ALBUMN FROM BON JOVI....,"G'day, This albumn is absoulutely fabulous. I have been listening to this albumn for over 2 weeks now and it just gets better - being in Australia, we were given the privilege of being able to get our hands on it from September 23rd. This albumn has a bit more of a heavier tone than the previous albumns and Ritchie is very prominent on the guitar on this one. An absoulute MUST for any Bon Jovi fan!!! You won't be disappointed."
1,Bounce this CD into the garbage bin!,"The album starts off with three decent, albeit unoriginal, rock songs but then disappears into the world of adult contemporary, barely to be heard from again. What a disappointment! ""Bounce"" is geared more toward fans of James Taylor and Barry Manilow than those who made them one of the biggest bands on the planet.This album should have been no more than a Jon Bon Jovi solo record as it appeals primarily to those looking escape to a quiet evening of sitting by the fireplace with a cognac in one hand and a good book in the other. Avoid at all costs!If your looking for a true rockin' CD with tons of great melodies, pick up Def Leppard's new disc, ""X"", instead."
5,Everything You Need To Know,"In one word, WOW! What a great album! There are both big loud rock songs and slow love songs.No matter which one of those tupes of music you like, you will like this album!Going from big loud rock songs to slow love songs makes a very enjoyable listeing experience.But the best part of this album is the use of modern technology into the songs, but the bandvery smartly tries not to over-use this.And if you are thinking about downloading it, DON'T! If you download it, you will not get to useAmerican XS, which gives you exclusive features and the right to buy concert tickets beforeanyone else.Not to mention the quality of sound if you download this album will not come even close to thequality of this album. They did a great job with the sound quality!"
4,Bounce Rocks!,"I love this album - I am a true Jovi fan, so I may be a little bias, but it ROCKS! Undivided, Everyday, Bounce and Hey Joey are my favorite tunes! The lyrics of all of the songs on this album are so easy to relate to! I love to sing to this album, playing full blast in my car..."
4,True Fan,"I think this is more an album for true Bon Jovi fans. It's a little heavier than I like, but I give the guys credit for trying different things. I especially like ""Everyday"" , again, a song for the true fans. Overall, I'm glad I have it in my collection."
3,"Mediocre, at best!","Bon Jovi continue their downward spiral. Once a great rock band, now an average pop band. There are a couple of good tunes like ""The Distance"" and ""Love Me Back To Life"", reminiscent of the old Bon Jovi. But then there's sickening, ivory-tinkling, Disney songs like ""Right Side Of Wrong"", ""Joey"" and ""Open All Night"".Overall, disappointing!"
4,"Bon Jovi - ""Bounce"" Review","I have been waiting for this album since I heard they were recording it. I was so excited when I bought it. Like a lot of songs, I have to get used to them before I like them. When I first heard ""Everyday"" in August, I wasn't a big fan, but it grew on me. Then I heard more and I got excited for the new cd. I have all the other Bon Jovi cds and I am fairly familiar with their style and their past styles.This album to me seems more emotional and dramatic than past ones. The band has been around for nearly 20 years, so obviously their style has changed, grown, matured, and developed over time. Because a lot of the album was inspired by the September 11th attacks, parts were very serious but very uplifting, as the title of the album suggests, ""Bounce.""Overall, I think the songs on this album have the same classic good rock beat that made Bon Jovi famous and made us all love them. Some took me a little while to get used to, and the style is different than in the past."
2,Does not bounce,"I am really disappointed with the new CD. I thought the latest would be as great as ""one wild night"" and others, but it was just too depressing. Too many slow songs and not enough energy flowing. I hope the next is much better."
4,Bon Jovi rocks with Bounce!,"Let me just say that I LOVE Bounce! My favorite songs are: Bounce, The Distance, and Undivided. Bon Jovi doesn't disappoint with their new release. I recommend everyone to go out and buy it as soon as possible!"
3,Jon & Richie's newest experiment falls short of expections.,"The overall effect of this recent release is less than expected; 'everday,' track number two, sound like a left-over from Crush (previous Bon Jovi production), while the remaining assortments reflect non-orginality and casual reflection of the pop rock genre."
2,throw it away!!,"frankly,i was excited when i bought it.Someone told me bonjovi are going back to their roots.heres how i review it-1.undivided-about 9/11.huge riffs,loud drums.good song.2.everyday-fast & good.3.the distance-o.k,4.joey-like elton john,5.misunderstood-pretty ordinary,6.all about loving you-fine,7.hook me up-very good,8.right side of wrong-rubbish song,9.love me back to life-garbage,10.you had me from hello-awful!,11.bounce-best song,12.open all night-dont wanna discuss that."
2,Simple Review,"Highlights: none, and that's the problem with this album. Don't get me wrong, all the tracks are good - just not great. Lowlight: Everyday. It sounded like they were just trying to come back to hard edged."
1,Too Many $#%@! Ballads!!,"If they had released an album of nothing but 80s pop-metal of yesterday, that would have been awesome compared to this. I was mislead horribly by the opening ""Undivided"" and the single ""Everyday"", two of the finest tracks by the band EVER, I mean these are my favourite BJ tracks out of their entire catalogue, but after that, this album just goes to hell and never comes back. Almost every song after is a ballad of some form..I thought I was finally seeing an album with a set of you know whats, but, what you got is slow, dopey ballads that really mean nothing. I'm all for ballads but what the..? TOO MUCH. I give the album a great big 2 stars because the title track isn't so bad, ""Hook Me Up"" comes close to being something I'd listen to again, and ""Joey"" is almost memorable, but meh! There's better music out there and there sure is better Bon Jovi out there. What does the future hold for the band? Who cares!? F this S, if you know what I mean! 2/12"
4,I like it but the magic just isn't as strong-Bounce,"You know when you buy a Bon Jovi cd it is going to be good. With all their talent it just can't be bad. This album reflex how alot of the way America feels right now. Numb. It really lacks the emotion Bon Jovi usally comes across with. I like the song You had me from Hello, Everyday, and Bounce. I have been a Bon Jovi fan forever. These guys work really hard. This was really hard for me to say. This is a good album but not great."
5,Worth the wait!,"This CD is definitely a must buy CD. There are so many songs on it that are good that it is hard to pick which one would be my favorite. If I had to choose I would pick Undivided, Everyday, Right Side of Wrong and Bounce. All of them for different reasons. I like Bounce because it's fun and Undivided I like the message it brings. Great job Jersey Boys!"
5,Bon Jovi - they are the best!!!,"When you really want to rock - then buy the new CD, it worth it!!! Most I like Undivided, Everyday, Bounce, Distance, Hook me up, You had me from hello, Misunderstood - I think - I love the whole CD :-) Rock with Bon Jovi as like at the 80's - we want to rock till we are 100 years old - Bon Jovi are the best of the world!!!"
5,Bounce,"Bon Jovi doest it again with Bounce. From the beautiful Ballads to Rock & Roll they have shown that they have what it takes to capture a new audience as well as keeping us ""80's"" fan coming back for more. ""Undivided"", ""Hook Me Up "" and ""Bounce"" are my favorites!"
4,Bounce Rocks,"If you haven't gotten this cd yet you are definitely missing out. It totally rocks. My favorite tracks are Undivided (gets me every time), Everyday, and Bounce. Richie's guitar playing rocksand the story telling that Jon and Richie do on this is awesome. Get your copy today if you haven't already."
5,Hello Rock n Roll again!,"Remember the bombastic style in the 80's? This CD is like a flashback. What makes them unique is the different styles on each CD and this one proves again what rock n roll is. I've bought over 100 for friends as I do with many of them. Well worth the price and gift potential who understands the group effort, fine thought and pure talent in this rare one of a kind CD. A MUST to your collection!"
1,Awful,"Bon Jovi has never completely been a rock band. They've always had heavy pop inflences in their music, all their 80s songs have pop hooks beneath the ""hair metal"" loudness. However, anything from the 80s by them is better than this. This is complete pop and should be avoided."
4,Bounce Rox!,"I absoultely love this album!! It is definately one of my favorites, it has hardly left my CD player! Even though I've always loved Bon Jovi from the very beginning, this album seems to fit more with today's music out there with the heavy guitar like Creed. Just like SWW did in the '80s. Although you have to be in the mood for the sometimes never ending story of being ""On the Right Side of Wrong"" or listen about ""Joey""'s life, when you're in the Bon Jovi zone it hits you like a ton of bricks!(Believe me I've already cried:) ) Every song on the album has its awesome qualities, so how can you go wrong? Go out and buy it!!!"
5,Love this album,"I was a little nervous about this album since I am not a huge fan of Crush and I was afraid this would be the same kind of album, but what a surprise! This is definitely one of the best, with great rock songs like Hook me Up and Everyday, songs with stories like Joey and Right Side of Wrong and of course, the classic Bon Jovi ballad, All About Loving You. If you are a Bon Jovi fan, this album is a must-have."
4,Not the old JBJ--But still good,"I think we'd all agree that Bon Jovi was in it's prime in the 1980's. He's matured, become a father and his music has matured also. His songs have depth. I wish I knew what inspired his writing in the 80's as I miss some of the hard-core rock songs that weren't filled with content--just fun--You Give Love A Bad Name, Runaway, In and Out of Love. (But I also miss my big 80's permed hair-do)In summary, they still rock, but in a new light that us die-hard 80's fans might need to adjust to."
4,Bounce Rocks,"Having been a Bon Jovi fan since the late 80's, I always look forward to the release of any new music by this rock band. Bounce was no exception, and it does not disappoint. Like all of their CD's it combines rock with several slow songs that express emotions must people can relate to. The first released single EVERYDAY could be described as the follow-up song to IT'S MY LIFE has a similar message. ALL ABOUT LOVING YOU is a love song that hits home. As always, I am pleased with the song selection on this album and I would recommend it to all Bon Jovi fans or anyone looking for a CD that rocks and sends messages that the whole world can relate to, especialy UNDIVIDED, which seems to be a song about 9/11. Bon Jovi and Bounce rock again!"
4,Just different enough to be good,"Bon Jovi proves again why they have managed to span two decades: they can reinvent themselves just enough to bring in new listeners and stay fresh while still appealing to their core base of fans. ""Right Side of Wrong"" and ""Joey"" are more traditional Bon Jovi fare while ""Undivided,"" ""Bounce"" and ""Everyday"" prove why they still deserve to be classified as rock. The group continues its foray into love songs celebrating long-term relationships with ""All About Loving You"" and ""You Had Me From Hello,"" though the latter seems a little too much like a poor version of Eric Clapton's ""Wonderful Tonight."" Also, ""Misunderstood"" seems one version away from being a great song as the elements in the song just don't quite work together. The album's closing track, ""Open All Night,"" is probably the strongest of the CD as it follows in the tradition of ""This Ain't a Love Song"" and ""Bed of Roses"" for being a love song of a different kind. All in all, a good CD well worth the price."
2,Bounce = Ouch!,"Sometimes change is good. Bon Jovi blew it with Bounce. Instead of new material, they re-hashed the old. Do people actually run out of new song ideas? Jovi has. Two stars only because I like Bon Jovi. Very disappointing release."
2,Not for Newcomers to the Campion Series...,"First published over 65 years ago, this entry in Allingham's long-running Campion series didn't do much to enthuse me to investigate other of Campion's adventures. It starts with the detective attending the funeral of an old schoolmate, who was rather widely despised. Several months later, Campion is called to the country to investigate a suspicious death, and the victim appears to be the same schoolmate. Wacky antics and murky mystery ensue. A kind of unsatisfying blend of P.G. Wodehouse and Agatha Christie which is unlikely to interest those who aren't already fans of the series. The one bright spot is Campion's valet, who is kind of a rough ""anti-Jeeves""."
3,I LOVE THIS SHOW,I got a used set so I can't really complain but its missing a disk. Other than that its one of my favorite shows if you don't get my humor you probably don't watch this show. :) SOUP SHOWER!!!
5,I knew it,"I've seen all the shows when they first aired, I've seen so many reruns but still need the DVDs. It's not the best show but definitely one of the best of all times and I will buy me all 8 seasons one at a time and probably watch 'em over and over again. Season Three is as good as the first two DVDs with all the additional material this time on the third disk. If you like 'em, get 'em!It's to sad they are in their final season now and hopefully the writers strike will not make it a sudden death."
5,The best season of Scrubs,"In this season the show really started to spread its wings as far as some of the topics they covered. While there is just as much great comedic performances as before, I was surprised at how well the dramatic points were played out as well. My favorite episodes would have to be My Screw Up and My Catalyst, both of which really leave a lasting impact on you more than the typical episode. If anyone ever pawns off this show as nothing more than a bunch of hospital gags, show them a couple episodes from this season which packs both laughs along with some major emotional wallops. Top to bottom, this is my favorite season of the show."
5,Scrubs: third season,This show is great! I love it! So funny! The third season is just as great as the first and second. I love it!
5,MOney Money MOney,"this item was a gift to a friend and she loves watching scrubs, it is the comedy version of grey's anatomy, with drama and life lessons. she watches this all of the time, thank you for your quick response to sending the item to me, thank you and it is appritiated"
5,it gets even better,"with the 3rd season of Scrubs we find our characters a bit more seasoned, yet just as vulnerable as they were. When they first started out.But the writers/producers and everyone involved in this show including guest stars like Tara Reid, Michael J. Fox, Scott Foley to name a few add a little bit of craziness in addition to what's already going on around the show making it. Something that really needs to be watched to see exactly what i mean. The show is seriously funny and even when a deep, serious moment comes up. You can find JD pondering away in one of his usually freaky and often times weird daydreams.Some shows aren't able to keep it up for 3 years and keep things fresh but Scrubs does throughout and is worthy of anyone's attention that loves to laugh and have fun watching TV."
5,scrub a dub dub these fools in a tub,the damn show is funny period.if you don't like this show you suck and need to lighten the hell up
5,Great Series,"I've been watching Scrubs since the first season, and I think it's one of the best comedies on TV. The cast works extremely well together, and the versitility of the actors is amazing (noticed during JD's day dream sequences)."
5,My Scrubs season 3 Review,"This is the best season of scrubs on DVD yet, with priceless Episode like ""My Screw Up"" and ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" it is a must own for all Scrubs fans."
3,Great episodes but disks freeze at menu,"The shows in season 3 are great and the overall disk quality is also good however...When I stopped an episode and then pressed the Menu button on my remote (common if you are viewing portions of episodes and want to quickly change to another episode on the same disk), my DVD player freezes and won't respond to ANY commands.I have to actually turn it off and back on to get it to respond. I have verified that it's only this set, all disks."
1,"big disappointment, it popped and was unusable after 5 uses! :(",Eagerly awaited this product. It was a huge disappointment because it popped and was unusable after 5 uses. I spent the extra money to get a good quality device.
2,Not much use for someone who studied music,"Looking for a book that might possibly give me a better insight into the aesthetic value of music, I bought this with high hopes. Having previously studied music, I was also hoping for a unique perspective and a broader education in classical music, but found this book to be nothing more than a college level textbook. It is arranged nicely and has great appendix on creating a music library. But the author is often long winded, using musical terms that aren't clearly defined and over descriptive and opinionated explanations of composers and their works. This might be nice for someone who has a beginning interest in classical music, but not for someone who has a working knowledge of the field."
2,Crooked,"The quality of the pearls looked fine. However, the stringing was not good and the pearls would not lay flat."
3,"Interesting, quick read","This is a very quick read about the life of a successful entrepreneur, from rags to riches. His ""Rayisms"" are the most noteworthy part of the book."
5,Very pleased,This is the second time I have ordered bowls and have been very pleased both times. The first time I ordered bowls was five years ago and they are still in great condition. We lost one rhinestone due to multiple moves.
2,A big disappointment - way too academic,This read like a college text book and was very disappointing. Just because it was about disco didn't make it entertaining or a very good read.
2,"Preachy, Agonizing.",This could have been such a great book... the sermonizing is braided into the text in such a way that you can't skip the preachy segments. Wall-to-wall sub-collegiate sociology clichés.
4,Disturbingly honest,"For a teenage diary, this is extremely well written. Jim Carroll was clearly a gifted writer, and his diary brings the New York City streets of the mid-60's to life. His vivid descriptions of growing up as a street wise kid on the mean streets of the city clearly paint a picture of the period.That said, this is was NOT a fun book to read. There is much about Carroll's life in this period that is not pretty. His growing dependency on drugs is readily apparent as the book progresses, as is his willingness to do almost anything to pay for his next fix. There are graphic descriptions of both the drug use and his sexual encounters, but even so there is a sense of honesty in the account that somehow seems to be redeeming. In the end, this is a powerful glimpse into a life on the streets."
4,Misguided Teenager,"A good book, very true real life situations. Jim Carrol growing up in the mean streets of New York. The situations were very real, and show what many teenagers have to go through today, even if they don't grow up in a large city. Violence and crime are spreading rapidly, and no teen is safe from it. I can't really understand why every person gave it five stars, to me five stars is a book that you read five times before reading another. Overall, the book is a very realistic and entertaining and I would recommend it to any teenager that is headed down the wrong path, it will most likely set them straight."
4,The Basketball Diaries,"I really loved this book. It is about the young Jim Carrol, who is now a famous poet and musician, but in his youth was a troublesome teen who expeirienced many tramatic things. Trying to make a name for himself, while maintaining his basketball reputation as well as his reputation on the tough streets of New York, he was exposed to drugs and much, much more. This diary is great for female AND MALE teens, and i highly recomend that you read it."
3,The Basketball Diaries Review,"The book ""The Basketball Diaries"" by Jim Carroll is about the life of Jim Carroll as a High School basketball player and a heroin attic. The book takes place in New York City's Lower East Side of Manhattan. Jim Carroll, the main character records his games as a basketball star in his diaries.He later becomes addicted to heroin and his life begins to change for the worse. He begins hustling, getting high and getting hooked. As Jim's life goes on so does his addiction to heroin. Jim also spends time in prison but, it still doesent set him straight.I think this was a really good book because it is a great example of how drugs ruin lives. Jim was a perfectly good student but then he fell into a heroin addiction and gave up on sports, school and life. Those are my thoughts on The Basketbal Diaries by Jim Carroll."
5,Compelling and Disturbing,This book was sooo super. It was very nutso to read and I'm a crazy guy. When he sodomized his teacher in that giant tub of potato salad I was like WHOA
5,SHIPPING,DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW LONG THIS BOOK TAKES FOR SHIPPING IT ?? HOPEFULLY 24 HOURS... I CANT SEEM TO FIND THAT INFORMATION ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE.. PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION... THANK YOU..
5,This book kept me from doing drugs.,"I read this book back in 1986 when I was 16 years old and ever since then I never had the urge to even consider expirementing with hard drugs. Jim Carroll Takes you down the downward spiral with him in this book. Just when you think it can't get any worse you turn the page and it does. this book is based on real events and there is no happy ending. you really get to see how far a junkie will will go for a fix. it shows you the dark, ugly, and oh so real side of drug addiction. I personally think every high school child in America should read this book then we might just win the so called war on drugs."
5,The naked true about a cool guy in the big apple. Excelent,"A review of kewl guy in NY. It realy changed my boaring life, now it is like a handbook 4 life. I like the idea of the Carrol's concept of life."
5,A Needful Book,You just feel grateful that someone like Carroll was able to survive and tell the tale so beautifully and with such honesty. He doesn't spare himself; he doesn't sentimentalize the drug addict's life--it's a work with a lot of integrity.
5,A timeless classic!,This is a very compelling read that is excellently written. It is very unfortunate that someone had to live this life but at least they got away from it eventually. You do feel like you are following Jim Carroll through the ups and downs (there are many downs) of his teenage life. All in all a book that will never date and that everyone should get a chance to read.
4,Ths Game Comes Second.,"I have to study this novel on my Sports Literature course at The University of Sheffield, England. I found that some of the other texts were based around training and preparation for, and the playing of, the game. THIS IS NOT BASKETBALL DIARIES! I picked up the book thinking that, with heart throb Leo on the cover, it would be a rags to riches tale of poor boy made good in the world of the NBA, full of moving (or vomit endusing) moments, and All-American clean living. How wrong was I? The novel is excellent! The game is secondary to drugs, homosexuality, and pedophillia. It is a chilling novel, but a fantastic read. I would recomend this book to anyone, except those who want to read about basketball, or those who want to buy it because of Leonardo's roles in Titanic and The Beach."
5,A masterpiece by a master Poet,"This book has to be the most fantastic and influential book I've read to date. I have been a fan of Jim's work for years, and he has inspired me enormously; only now is he getting the reprieve he deserves. Here's to you Jim!"
5,"Love It, Hate It, Love It","All I can say is that I just saw the tediously boring ""Requiem for a Dream"" and at least Jim has a sense of humor. Another thing about Jim: at no point does he feel sorry for himself. I thought Aronofsky would never top the terrible film ""Pie"" but he did. His utterly humourless movie ""Requiem for a Dream"" prompted me to think about the diaries. The Basketball Diaries makes everything in its genre look sickeningly lame by comparison. Some stories are told. This is one of them. Any book about adolescent drug use must first go through this one, and, not surprisingly, most of them look embaressingly stupid when held up to this biting, if sordid and depressing, tale of woe."
2,compelling story but poor translation,"I'm only in the middle of the second book (out of 4), so take my review with that in mind.The biggest problem I have is that the English translaction is extremely poor. It is not the content I'm complaining about, but the writing. It is so lousy that it will take away from your enjoyment of the story.The story is compelling but there is a few things that bothered me about it:1) whenever the main character (of the moment) gets in big trouble, his predicament is always bailed out by some incredible coincidence that his assailant (or antagonist at the moment) is actually a friend or knows a friend of his. It is ALWAYS like that, throughout the book.2) the characters in the book, whether they are righteous or unrighteous, always get lauded as heroes. You can have a despicable character and yet he is respected among his peers...why? Maybe it is a cultural phenomena that I am not aware of.anyways, I'm going to finish the entire series and see what happens."
2,This is no Robin Hood.,"This book is entertaining at first, with multiple parallel stories. However, in the beginning of the second volume, it starts to get a little crazy. The protagonists are constantly drunk or eating mountains of meat. They are often crude and without reason, acting like bullies to those who do not sate their appetites. There are several events that make the protagonists extremely unlikable. It is outrageous how one of the protragonists would stick his neck out to help one organized crime boss over another, thinking that he is actually doing something righteous. In another instance that same character not only takes revenge on those who wronged, but also kills the women and children that live with them. He goes on to kill several more innocent people, and all the while gets off scott free. I just couldn't read anymore after that."
2,Anti-climactic and poorly printed,"I must confess that I read this book hoping for another Romance of the Three Kingdoms. While Outlaws of the Marsh starts strongly, following a number of interesting characters as they attempt to escape from misfortune, I lost interest about half way through. The last 20 or so chapters (excluding the final chapter) were very boring and difficult to read and nothing exciting really happens. By the end of the 2000 odd pages it is easy to forget that the first half was so exciting and fast-paced.As for the translation itself, it is not too bad. Some translations make the characters out to be villains whereas Shapiro's translation takes a more neutral approach. The printing is on very thin, delicate paper with lots of typing errors and as such is a bit disappointing. There are also some paintings reproduced in the text but these are of very low quality."
4,"Classic literature, and readable at that...","Classic literature, and readable at that, but I only read the first 1000 or so pages. That's about half. As is common in Chinese literature, the Outlaws of the Marshes, also know as Water Margin is thematically repetitive. The same basic pattern repeats for many of the outlaws and I just didn't feel the need to read 1000 more pages of slaughter, mayhem, marauding, debauching, and prison breaks with the same general twists repeating.On the other hand, if you are a scholar of Chinese history and literature, it is possible to derive certain insights about the social climate and views based on the events depicted since it is a major work of Ming dynasty literature."
3,Outlaws,"Although both Keifer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips turn in fine preformances, their characters are just a bit over the top. Both would have been put in prison along with any surviving criminals for a long time. That said this is mindless entertainment and most people will enjoy it. Fans of the ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Die Hard"" series will like it for certain. Sutherland plays a cop after a gang that stole some diamonds and left dead bodies in their wake. The real problem is he helped them while he was undercover. Phillips plays a Native American with a group loaning a Lakota lance to a museum. The diamond thieves murder Phillips brother and steal the lance so he goes on the warpath. This movie goes to extremes for these two to catch the thieves/killers with little regard to innocent bystanders. This is one for that big bowl of popcorn, and no thinking action."
4,Action,I like this movie for the action and comedy as well. It's down to earth when someone is trying to get rid of you. and what length they go to. I like the main actors and worth watching.
3,Just OK,"No Spoiler Here. I am not done, but I am almost done, I'm far enough to have read the climax. It is a good book. Not great. The characters seemed a bit off. Randi didn't have enough contempt for Jon and so wasn't sassy enough. Jon didn't miss his widow enough and he didn't seem to have many inner battles. I liked what the author did with Marty."
4,The Best Covert-One Novel,This is the very best Covert-One Novel I have read to date. Action packed from the start to the end.
3,"Not bad, considering","It's really not bad, considering... The descriptions in places like Toledo are fairly good. The author has a good grasp of how to describe (perhaps over describe) things. The plot is passable(almost).Keep in mind all the other stuff that passes for books recently, and you will see. It's nowhere as good as Ludlum's early stuff, but even the Great Ones (can you say Clancy) have gone downhill recently."
3,Ludlum Lite,"Paris Option is the third installment of the Covert One series that I have read. As a long-time Ludlum fan, I am still trying to get used to the series. Up to this point, the tales have been lighter and clearly not as complex as the typical Ludlum fare. This is not all bad, however, as the concept of ""Ludlum Lite"" has a certain appeal in its own right - although true Ludlum aficionados may be disappointed. If you are considering picking up the Covert One books, I would recommend starting with The Hades Factor to provide a nice foundation in terms of character building for future works in the series. With Paris Option, character development continues from the earlier work, leading to a quick read. All-in-all, not great but not bad."
2,Yawner.,"Maybe OK for beach reading, but barely. If you should happen to forget where you stopped reading, no matter if you skipped a few pages -- maybe that's even better! Not like Robert Ludlums earlier works. Has internal inconsistencies, like the hero picking a door lock when a blast of gunfire from an AK47 inside shreds the door, but just ""nicks"" our hero. After he goes inside to dispatch the baddie (a woman), he leaves the apartment carefully shutting the door behind him. Huh? The plot of this book is one escape from baddies after another. Ultimately the United States is going to be destoyed by a launched Russian nuclear missile until an autistic computer expert saves the day. Yawn. Try reading Alan Furst's spy novels instead. They are really good!"
1,Travesty,"It is unfortunate that Mr. Ludlum's name graces this novel. Rarely do I fail to complete a book; several failed attempts later it would appear that this one has beaten me. The dialog is contrived, characters are undeveloped, and the storyline tired. As others have indicated; stick to the vintage Ludlum."
2,total lack of authenticity,"I've read a lot of Ludlum books but this book is so totally ""off"" in terms of technical authenticity and detail that anyone who understands a little about computers, etc. should stay away - it is just to difficult to read when you can't respect the knowledge of the authors."
1,Paris Garbage,"This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that ""swarthy"" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, ""evil"" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, ""Islamic"" MEANS ""terrorist."" And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time."
1,Disappointing,"I am an avid Robert Ludlum fan. I thought his earliest books were excellent, then the quality fell off for a bit and his last few books were getting better. I even enjoyed the first two books of the Covert-one Novels. I hate to say this about anyone's writing, but this book was HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I kept reading, hoping that at some point it would grab me and I would not be able to put it down, but instead I have now decided to never read another one of these novels."
1,Where's My Book????????,It has been a month and I still have not received my product. I have contacted the company and they said I should receive it shortly. That was a week ago. I would not recommend this vendor.
3,Starts Ho-Hum but improves.,"Well, these Covert One series are not really Robert Ludlum, but some selected writers to use the Ludlum success stories. At least this is how I understand what is taking place with this series, since I think Robt. Ludlum has passed away.This particular author gets off to a tedius start it seems, but the storyline improves, then sort of drags again in the middle of the book. Not done with it yet but will write another review when done if anyone's interested.James of Vancouver, WA"
2,Far cry from Ludlum's original novels,"The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax."
1,Impossible for me to finish reading,"If you cannot say something good about somebody, it is best tosay nothing."
2,Embarrassingly uninteresting,"How bad can it be when you wish that the terrorists in the book killed all the heroes and did succeed in nuking half of the world?If it were a movie, it would go directly to a DVD release (the lower shelves).pass safely."
3,"Not as good as the first two, but still entertaining","Too many characters make a story difficult to follow and that's the case with this book in the Covert One series. However, the premise of this super computer is startling and makes for a good story line. I do love the main characters, Marty, John Smith, Randy and the droll englishman. Worth a listen, especially on tape."
3,"Too many words, too little imagination","For those of you who can still remember how the Osterman Weekend changed your reading habits and the standards of thrillers forever you will be sorely disappointed by this collaboration on a Lundlum novel published after his death in 2001. Firstly, it is way too long and the permise was just so unblievable... a DNA computer? That morphs into something the more it is used.. is that like DNA? I don't think so. I still gave it a solid 3 because of the sheer enjoyment I have derived over the last several decades with Mr. Ludlum as my companion. But this book showed absolutely no imagination. The narrow escapes are tired and overused. In the immortal worlds of Jason Borne and Carlos the Jackal no one gets out alive! If you want to preserve the purity of your Robert Ludlum memories, story lines and downright thrills you will skip this attempt to continue on in his name. As sad as it is to say goodbye."
4,IN FLAMES MEETS DEATH!,This is my favorite release by Duskfall so far. It sounds like Old In Flames meets Death. Its a great album I definitely recommend it for all fans of death metal...1: The Light - 5/5 a great opening for this album.2: Age of Errors - 4/53: Agoraphobic - 5/5 It gets me in a headbaggin' mood :)4: Poison The Waters - 4/5 sounds like a Dark Tranquillity song...not sure which though.5: None - 4/5 one of the albums better songs6: Farewell Song - 5/5 another great song with great riffs7: Frailty - 20/5 - its THE best duskfall song in my opinion.8: Tune of Slaughtered Hearts - 5/59: Just Follow - 10/5 another song I love...I like the emotion to it.10: Deliverance - 5/5
2,The Art of War,When trying to read the book it is hard to tell where the book ends and where the writers opinion begins. Actual translation mixed with the authors interpretation make this a difficult read. I would recommend the standard version.
2,Possibly Overrated Due to Pop Culture Popularity,"Granted, most readers will find some wisdom in ""The Art of War""; on the other hand, perhaps most of this ""wisdom"" is simply common sense dressed up in militaristic metaphors. I know that some of the popularity behind this book stems from the fact that plenty of its readers (usually male) are hip-hop figures, business types, and budding entrepreneurs. I'm sure the occasional gang leader took some leadership cues from Sun Tzu (was there really a Sun Tzu?) and this probably created an almost cult-like devotion to an ""ok"" book. I believe it's not quite one of the best leadership books ever, as some might suggest. Read it to relieve your curiosity, then delve into more modern tomes by folks such as Seth Godin or Guy Kawasaki if you're looking to start a business in today's world. In addition, you'll gain still more by reading biographies by one of today's business leaders."
5,monumental,The art of war is one of the most monumental books ever written. It's still being read centuries after Sun Tzu died. It's the best advice on getting power and rising to the top. It also is great advice on defending yourself against enemies or competition.
1,"TERRIBLE TRANSLATION, INCOMPLETE","Don't waste your money on this. The translation is clumsy, the layout is horrible, and it isn't even the complete book. Buy Thomas Cleary's translation."
1,Do Yourself a Favor,"Unless you really want a tiny, cheap version of one of the most important books ever written, you should do yourself a favor and get a different edition. This one is an embarrassment.Almost any of the other editions (except for the miniature edition that also sells for $4.95) is a much better choice than this turkey. If you are going to take the time to read an English translation of a 2,500 year old Chinese classic, you really should do yourself a favor and get a better edition."
2,"An intro, not comprehensive","If you are looking at a comprehensive view of Sun Tzu's Art of War, this is not the book to get. It really covers some of his principles from a distance, not really a comprehensive view or direct translation of his work. Please note that this book is very short and appears to be written as a synopsis. If you are looking for a quick read or intro into his principles, than this should be good enough for you. But if you would like more thorough insight, I'd search elsewhere."
3,"good book, but i am not sure if this is a full edition","I have saw Art of War for the first time in my firends house, it was a coniderably big book and the accounts in it were told by stories.This book is more like a manual, i just has bullet points of wisdom, not the rich content of storytelling and parables..That is not to say it isnt good, it like it.So if you are looking for a nice short version and are looking simply for the heart of the matter, this is your book."
5,Classic Chinese Strategy Guide Applicable To Coaches!,"Many of you might be thinking, ""Why in the world would I need an ancient Chinese Military Classic on my bookshelf?""When a friend of mine suggested that I purchase this book, I asked myself that exact question. None-the-less I purchased the book and almost 100 pages later (because the entire book is just about 100 pages) I understood exactly why he had suggested it.This treatise has applications reaching far beyond battle field ethics and strategy. For me, replacing the word ""enemy"" with ""opponent"" converts the book into a strategical synopsis for the field of sport. Sun Tzu lays out the ways and means to manage teams of people in straight forward simple language. This application reaches into politics, business, sport, and any managerial position.I highly recommend this short, but critical read to anyone in a position of people management. This book will make you think about the strategies that you use in the command posts of your life."
4,Good,The real deal. Tons of good information to help you better understand what it takes to actually keep a fighting army in the field.
4,Many applications,"This classic has many applications to real life. It's a short easy read, and you can draw comparisons and parallels between war and whatever you'd like."
1,Hate is not a term I throw around lightly,"I hated this version of The Art of War.All of the possible artfulness and poetic nature of these beautiful writings is totally lost on this muse-less academic version. Be prepared for the editor jumping in just about every other passage to add his own 2 cents, and possibly the most unnecessarily lengthy introduction to a book that has ever been done. The commentary isn't even useful, most of the comments are entirely benign and contribute nothing to the reading at all.The kindle version contains terrible line breaks, no chapter delineations, and clearly was a copy paste job from the original manuscript.Maybe the introduction could be useful to an academic studying this work? I can't think of much Resurrection for this as a 'good read' though."
4,Better than expected.,"I'd heard all about this book throughout the years. Some people have sworn by it, some people had written it off as 'over-rated'. I personally find this book inspiring, as like many others, I try and apply 'The Art of War' to my every day life. Is it some sort of spiritual or mental awakening? No, not at all. Do I plan on leading my life on by the words of Sun Tzu? Of course not. However, I will say that many of the sayings/verses within this book are very inspiring to me; through the words of a man who lived centuries ago on another continent, I can take his broad view of life and see my own more clearly.A solid, inspirational read, but if you're a collector, go with the hard copy."
5,Great Book,This book is timeless and will always have reread value. It came in great condition and without delay. I would recommend to anyone who likes to read books that can be applied to real life situations.
4,Stands the Test of Time,"There is a reason this book is still selling and why the lessons have been geared (in spin off books) towards all sorts of lifestyles other than war.This particular version is very cool as it offers the original wording with other history, info and comments as well.This book has long been on my list to read. I was not dissapointed. Can we get a crate of these sent to the White House?"
1,"The Art of War by Sun Tzu [Kindle Edition] , Price: $3.51",I have just downloaded the kindle edition. The pagination is awful rendering the text to be almost unreadable. amazon need to up their game and not charge for this abysmal level of quality of reproduction.
3,Classic? Whatever.,"I have wanted to read this for a long time now only b/c I've heard so much about how you can apply it's theories to every day life. Well, I suppose you can. Sorta. But after a while it gets exhausting hearing about how you need to wake up earlier than your enemy; know more than you're enemy; be more rested than your enemy; blah blah blah. Long story short, study hard. Work hard. I'm glad I have quenched my curiosity, but I'm glad I got it on the kindle and that it's NOT taking up room on my bookshelf. It ain't that special."
1,This is Not the Whole Book !!!,"Although it contains an excellent translation, the Dover Edition of Sun Tzu's Art of War should come with a warning that says: ""This book only gives you the bare Giles Translation - without his extensive explanation and notes - that are essential to provide real meaning to anyone other than a Chinese scholar.""In spite of the rather wordy introduction of this edition, it doesn't do justice the Sun Tzu's great book. It is a pale reflection of the real thing.The full Giles Translation (which is NOT what this edition is) is a first-rate piece of literature that presents the genius of Sun Tzu in a way that it can be really understood and appreciated by modern English speaking readers. You should spend a few dollars more and get the full Giles Translation - it will be money well spent."
4,This bare-bones version is a bargain.,"Sun Tzu's masterpiece, ""The Art of War"" is one of the most important books ever written. For the price, this bare-bones version is a bargain.You should note, however, that this is more of a booklet than a book. There is little to recommend this particular edition. The details, the subtle shades of meaning and the historical context, are left unexplained. If this is to be your only copy of Sun Tzu, you are going to miss out on a lot of the important details.A better choice is ""The Art of War by Sun Tzu - Special Edition"" that contains two versions of the Giles' translation in one book: both a plain vanilla version and the complete version which includes a comprehensive introduction and a detailed running commentary."
3,Buyer Beware,"This is the old, public domain translation of The Art of War. I had to return this book, along with a few others which suffer from this problem. Luckily, Amazon handled the exchange of the two books I had to return promptly.As to the The Art of War itself, it is of course the most important work on military philosophy ever written (at least that's what my husband told me to write). I am plowing through the other deluxe edition I received instead of this one with the errors, but so far it is just as fascinating as the special about The Art of War I saw on the History Channel."
3,It's a start,"This is a good starting point for a young man or woman studying war tactics and strategy. However, I honestly must say Art of War is to war as the Constitution of the United States of America is to democracy. To better understand democracy, the Constitution should be included, but without the Federalist Papers, and writing by Pericles, Aristotle, Machiavelli, John Adams, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, John Locke, Thomas Paine, and many others, the reader has yet to scratch the democratic surface.Many people that put too much weight in Art of War.That being said, I found Art of War a good work, relevant, and interesting. It's not too long and the material found within Sun Tzu's pages may be applied to many other areas of life and business other than war."
2,The Art of War,The book was to boring. Couldn't keep my attention... had to force myself to read the book.
3,nothing new for those of us with experience,"This book is a 101 guide to being a good military strategist, if you already have spent allot of time researching Military Science such as I have then I wouldnt bother reading it because allot of it you will already know, but if you are a beginner in Military Science then I would recommend this as a first read, however I wouldnt purchase it because the book is so old it can be downloaded free of the internet."
4,Essential Read,"These are the thoughts of a wise man. It is well presented and well organized. Sun Tzu may have alluded to war, but is talking about many facets of life in general. Reading this book will help prepare almost anyone for whatever ""battles"" they may have to fight in daily life."
3,"Product is good, material is stupid","I am kind of torn on how many stars to give this as the product itself (the audio book) is great, but the actual content is retarded. Sun Tzu spouts off a bunch of useless crap like:""If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.""Thank you Sun Tzu, for summarizing war into neat little equations for us:Function for computing losses during outmaneuver operation: F(x) = (if x = 50 then 1 leader and 0.50 of force else if x = 0.333 then 0.6667 of force)"
1,"Cheap, print on demand book,crappy quality",None of the pages were the same size. It looked like someone cut the individually with scissors. Uneven. Horrible quality and not worth the money I paid. I could have printed a better looking book off the internet and stapled it together
2,Over-rated,"This is a very popular book and comes highly recommended from many places. Sadly, I was unimpressed. Perhaps this particular translation is bad. I haven't read others do I can't comment on that aspect. However, this particular copy was not worth the read."
2,Too Complicated,Im not stupid.. but im not super intelligent either..This piece of literature is too hard for me to understand. i gave up on the book.. I should've bought one ith explanations!!
5,Like a new recording,"Having previously reviewed the original Marco Polo release for Amazon, there is little I can add to what Mr. Zeidler says, except to emphasize that the increase in clarity of the Naxos release over its predecessor is not only noticeable but in some places remarkable. Having listened to the MP edition well over a hundred times, in playing the Naxos I immediately heard numerous details I had previously missed The woodwinds in particular benefit from the increased clarity on this release.If you already have the MP release, add this one to your collection. It is the nearest thing we're likely to have to a new recording for some time. And buy it for your friends...."
2,Not what it appears to be,"My 5 year old granddaughter played with this for a while then lost interest in it. The ""waterfalls"" is not what you would think it is and has to be pumped. It is hard to pump and play at the same time.Just buy the doll and let them play in the tub or sink. Not worth the extra cash."
4,Speakers,"I purchase those to replace 4"" Pyle speakers.They sound much better and so far i like them.Don't find any cons at this time.Price is good too."
1,Copyright violation,"Re the edition sold by GenealogyAuthor- This edition breaches copyright and is published without the permission of the copyright owner and literary executor of Douglas Goldring, Polly Bird, PhD."
5,Review of One Heart CD,"....""The songs are just wonderful on this CD, and I find myself listening to it again and again. Its become a daily nighttime ritual when retiring for a very relaxing way to wind down."""
1,Technical Difficulties,I had to return this CD twice because there was loud static on tracks 4 and 5. It's too bad because it was a relaxing and enjoyable CD.
2,Not what I requested,They told Me it was one thing but ended up being something entirely different. The product did come in a timely fashion if that helps.
1,Don't last long...,"I purchased this as a replacement for one that failed after a short time. I was trying to replace with the same pump, but that was a mistake, because the new one has already failed too. Poor design!The problem is with the little plastic shaft and its cog that engages a cog in the shaft sleeve of the impeller. There is play and *they do not fully mesh*, so after a month or two, the plastic sleeve just breaks from wear and the impeller stops spinning. I found that I could put the pieces together with a dose of superglue (making the whole assembly solid) and that got the broken pumps to work... for now, but there is no way I can recommend this pump. Be forewarned!"
1,high failure rate,"I bought this pump 2 years ago. The impeller failed after one year - the ridges on the shaft had worn down. I replaced it for about $12. After 10 months the replacement also failed. I bought another one, and it failed after 3 months. I glued the rotor blade to the impeller and it worked for a while. Now the motor has failed. Poor design. Not recommended.By comparison, I had bought a larger Little Giant pump (1150 gph)for a larger pond, and it has been running without problems for more than 10 years!"
3,Mag Drive Model 1.9,"Pump is ok, works for what is intended to do. This is the third one of this model for me"
1,This is not as described,I have ordered several of these adapters and it seems Cables Online is selling a cheap duplicate of the CABLES TO GO adapter.This product is great as long as you get what you order however unless it comes in a CBLES TO GO bag part number 27314 you may find you are getting a cable which may not be of the same quality and you will get a cheaper connector set as well as a finer gauge wire.
5,THE ROOSEVELT WOMEN reads like a good novel.,"I've just finished a wonderful book which I'd like to recommend to anyone interested in a good read. Betty Boyd Caroli's, THE ROOSEVELT WOMEN, reads like a good novel. It's filled with interesting stories, enticing gossip, and legendary women, - all combined with good history. Although I was familiar with Eleanor Roosevelt's story, I must admit that I knew very little about most of the Roosevelt women Ms. Caroli introduced me to. These aunts and cousins were role models for Eleanor - women who traveled the world, wrote books, served in state legislatures, even addressed the Republican National Convention - all while raising families and running large households. If you want some insight into the lives of the women in this very special American family, this is the book for you."
4,A very good read,"Two years ago,I started my Teddy Roosevelt addiction when I was browsing through a book store as my wife was signing up for a tole painting class next door. Though the book store is no more I read everything I can about the Roosevelts.After six books about TR, I felt I wasnt getting a full picture about his parents or his siblings.When the author centers her story around the family other than Teddy I got a better perspective on him as a son,brother and uncle.If you want know more about a very interesting family.I highly recommend this book. Then you will agree with me and wonder why Spielberg hasn't made their story into a film. Heck I would settle for a mini-series on Lifetime."
5,It wasn't just Eleanor,"Surprise, a lot of the interesting ""Roosevelt"" women married into the clan!Betty Caroli writes and interesting and fast moving, factual, book about the women in both the ""Theodores"" and ""Franklins"" branches of this amazing, intermarried, family. She manages to tell their stories with a minimum of confusion which is no mean feat since the Roosevelts like a number of other families tend to use the same ""family"" name generation after generation and collateral branches.After visiting Hot Springs, GA and Hyde Park, NY (including Val Kill and The Cottage on the Hill) I had to know more about the women who supported (and sometimes managed) the men and families and travelled the world when travel was long and arduous. Fabulous reading."
5,"""Roosevelt Women,"" which reads like a novel, was a pleasure","I was delighted to read Betty Boyd Caroli's new book, ""The Roosevelt Women."" While I've read a lot about Eleanor Roosevelt, I knew next to nothing about the other Roosevelt women. According to Caroli's book, ER's aunts had a major influence on her. Perhaps the future First Lady saw in them what strong women could accomplish. The aunts and cousins Caroli describes were quite accomplished in their own right. They wrote books, traveled the world, one became a state legislator and one even gave a speech at the Republican National Convention. While they seemed to have very active lives apart from their husbands, they also played traditional female roles raising children and running large households. ""The Roosevelt Women"" reads like a novel. It was a pleasure to learn about the other women in this amazing family."
1,Inaccurate on Eleanor,"Coroli discounts assertions that Eleanor Roosevelt had a lesbian affair with Lorena Hickok -- an affair that is more than amply documented in another book out this season, published by Macmillan, (and available from Amazon.com) entitled: Empty Without You : The Intimate Letters of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok."
1,old news,"Lots of fascinating Roosevelt women are missing from this stew. Why not give a line or two to Selwa ""Lucky"" Roosevelt, Chief of Protocol for the Reagan White House, or the distinguished anthroplogist Anna C. Roosevelt, of Chicago's Field Museum? What is the point of focusing so much attention on Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt Longworth, each of whom have been the subjucts of dozens of full biographies? Is there really, at this point, anything we don't all already know about Eleanor, Alice and their often-strained relationship? As Caroli's dull book demonstrates, the answer is ""no""."
2,nothing new,There is no fresh research here. Just old stories regurgitated. So Alice Longworth was sharp tongued and Eleanor Roosevelt was destroyed by an emotionally-bankrupted childhood. What else is new?
1,Trivial one-dimensional portraits,The book's treatment of most Roosevelt women is trivial and one-dimensional. For example: Mittie = Southern Bell. Sara = haughty Brahmin dowager. Eleanor = do-gooder. And so forth. I gleaned absolutely no new insight from this work. NOTHING. Now I realize why Publishers Weekly gave it such an awful review.
1,Raging Leftist POV,"I was disgusted by this book! To suggest that our role as teachers is to build a social order is fundamentally WRONG. I had to read this book and hated ever moment of it. How is it possible that there is a class of people out there who think it is their JOB to value and promote a certain ideology...TEACH, people, that's your JOB!Oh, and my job too! I am a teacher; a proud teacher who doesn't teach my students WHAT to think, I teach them HOW to think.You want to raise your blood pressure? Read this book."
4,Just what I needed for my beads,"Good colors, variety of tones and it was perfect for small beads or earrings. They are not big enough for larger jewelry though."
3,little jewelry bags.,"these are fine and nicely made - a bit stiff, but very inexpensive. good colors. (word, word, word, word, word)"
3,Good,Good but small . So maybe they should say the size. Because I thought they were going to be a little bigger
5,Amazing Book,"I had been an Agatha Christie fan for years when my Aunt first told me about Ngaio Marsh. I picked up this book around the Holidays, and was hooked. The plot was full of twists, and the characters were very well developed. This really was an amazing book."
3,bigger and heavier than I expected,"I don't have anything to compare and this is my first binocular so I don't want to review the optical quality of this product. The build quality of this binocular is fine but not so impressive. It's bigger and heavier than I expected. The packaging is really simple, just a paper box. there's not even a piece of paper in it. No warranty information, no manual (although I don't need one but at least a brief introduction of this product)."
5,Annick Goutal Petite Cherie,"Excellent, great, ligth scent, perfect to wear the entire year despite the weather and temperature. Not strong at all. Light and airy."
2,A little disapointed,"After many people said me that parfum is amazing, I decided to try it. Well, I have to confess that I'm not impressed with him. It doesn`t have a good fixation and is more more soft. After one hour I couldn`t feel anything on my skin. Until my soap smells more than parfum. I`m a little disapointed with this but I'm going to try one or two more times.. maybe I can adapt me."
5,No sitting on the fence to make this purchase,"Definitely the naughtiest of the bunch, and one I couldn't be without. This special edition of the Shadow Dancers is beyond what you'd expect a dvd to be. It's full of spectacular imagery that will stimulate every part of your body!"
5,This book is a great and easy way to learn japanese!,"if you want to learn japanese FAST than you really should buy this book. Trust me because i have bought many books and i have gone to many language classes just to learn how to speak japanese. so what im basically saying so far is that ya mid as well spend ya money now because as soon as you start trying your never gonna stop looking for a useful source to learn japanese, because it really is a complicated language and it is so very different than english so you need to find a easy way to learn japanese. So like I said you might as well get it over with and spend about 60 dollars on a book but seriosly, it a lot better than just trying to look for a good japanese book when it doesnt seem to be very helpful."
2,Poor marketing in action,"Why, I ask, wasn't this massively cross-referenced mini-feature grouped with (at least a couple) others in the series? This apparently aired on TV, and my sleeve claims a 51-minute duration, which could perhaps be cut in half to be accurate. Henry Fonda gives an almost random, less than riveting introduction, and the actual feature suggests that the short story on which this is based may have taken up all (or most) of 2.5 pages. The story is very simple, so that children may understand it, though the adolescent target audience would be quite a stretch today. The whole thing (especially the open ending) just confused me. I sat waiting for the ""second half"" until the end-of-tape auto-rewind function dashed my hopes. This could be the very antithesis of ""Roots""."
4,Wonderful Christmas Memories,"Jane Seymour does an outstanding job of introducing scenes from the brightest and best of Hollywood Christmas films. There are the real classics ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (the original, of course), ""White Christmas"", and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" The excerpts from seven versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" let you compare the various actors who played Scrooge. The best in my book is the 1951 version featuring Alister Sim. More recent highlights include ""Home Alone,"" and ""The Santa Claus."" It's a nice review of the way that Hollywood treats Christmas and should be part of everyone's Christmas DVD collection."
3,Didn't I tell You About my Hemorroids?,"The movie depicts the story of a man whom, after killing his wife guilty of exotic cooking, begins to discover the pleasures of human flesh. Not very gory, this movie is more comedy than horror and it could amuse - maybe ;) - if you're in the right disposition of mind. The tagline ""worst horror movie"" is a little exaggerated, i've seen worse!No extras (only two trailer) but the image quality is very good."
4,frosty the snowman has a taste for human flesh!,Jackie Vernon the voice of Frosty the snowman is a flesh eating man with magic touch for the ladies and cooking in a microwave.Check it out!
2,Not an impressive diet book,tells you nothing you don't already know and really didn't offer much advise.
3,When is your book coming out?,"I cannot rate the book as I have not even read it yet. However to the previous person's review... shame on you for attacking Dr. Smith by assuming you know his credentials and history. Whether or not he has or completed or not completed his ""residency"" would not change the value of the content from a nutrition stand point.More importantly, I give Dr. Smith credit for all he has done at such a young age to get where he has... when is YOUR book coming out?"
1,"Oh, please!","I agree with the reviewer who said Dr. Ian Smith is a little too hyped for someone so young and lacking in real medical credentials. He reminds me a lot of Barack Obama----the good looking ""rock star"" of the Democratic Party---all fluff and no substance.Also, to all of you who keep saying....""great book, it changed my life. Buy it!"" Give it a rest please. When did you start this diet? How much have you lost? How long have you kept the weight off? If you haven't lost any weight on this diet and kept it off for at least a year, your reveiws are worthless."
1,"Another ""life changing"" book????","This book is just another of those formulaic diet/lifestyle books that seem to pop up every few months. In this case, it was written by a doctor whom, I gather, has not even finished his residency. This book seems like just another promotional piece for Dr. Smith (notice that the cover is just his picture).Let's face it, we all know what to do to be healthy. Unfortunately, not enough of us do it... and no book will get us to do it, either, unless it's really based on good science and clinical judgement, a la Dr. Dean Ornish or Dr. Andrew Weil. Both of those authors have the clinical credentials to make you sit up and take notice. It's hard to do the same coming from a doctor who has never practiced medicine."
3,Read the Book First,"Read the book first to make sure you understand what is involve, especially the Phase I plan. This is the plan where you cannot have coffee, pop/soda, and juice. Just water, 1% or skim milk, and herbal tea with you meals (are to drink water as much as you can). Make sure you eat plenty of veggies that you like, becauses everyone don't like all veggies."
2,This diet is too strict for the average dieter.,"You gotta love Dr. Ian and overall this book is very well written. But the problem is the diet is very, very, VERY strict and harsh. Against my better judgement, I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my 19-year old daughter who would not stop asking for it. She is an athlete and a college honors student, and only wants to lose 20 lbs. But I truly see no way that she would be able to ever stick to the strict letter of this diet. So I feel like I am setting her up to fail and the very first diet experience of her life will be failure. Not a good thing. I do not recommend this book for the first-time dieter, but I'm sure it would be fine for a more serious dieter. You REALLY need to be a strict dieter who can live on total fruits and veggies for 9 days if you want to use this book. Good luck."
4,My view ofThe Take Control Diet,"I think this is a well balanced diet, it focuses on reducing calories and fat to lose weight not just cutting out entire food groups. It explains other fad diets and why they may have some success but ultimately why they are not the best choice. Easy to follow."
2,"Great sound, eats batteries","I have to admit that these speakers sound great, especially for their size. However, batteries only last a couple of hours. I had ordered these for my computer system at work. So, I searched for the AC adapter, and it has been discontinued. And, even when it was available, it was $29.99! Almost as much as the speakers! Sometimes it gets frustrating that Sony makes all their adapters proprietary, so that universal adapters won't work."
2,Look for other options,Sound quality is pretty good. The design is unacceptable imo. Battery door keeps popping open. There's no place for the wire to retract when not in use. It takes 4 AA batteries and it should be bundled with an AC adaptor.
2,THE BOSTON STRANGLER (2005) DVD 2 / 5,"Talk about a dull movie. The facts were not all drawn out right nor was the personal information about Albert De Salvo. In summary, boring movie with Albert's mind games about the thirteen women he supposedly killed in the 60's."
1,One of the worst flics Ive ever seen,"Terrible on every level. The lead actor is an Italian playing an American w/ a horrible accent and lisp. It's laughable. Production values are worse than a student film. The actor playing John Bottomly, the lead investigator, has a modern haircut - he hasn't even bothered to cut his hair to reflect that it's 1963. Forget script. its awful. Why bother making a movie when you are this lazy. Can i have my money back?"
1,Baaaaaaaaaad,Apparently the producers of this film has no budget for lights....Every scene is in the dark with a thunderstorm raging outside and ghosts houling in the background....and... Ricky Ricardo as Albert DeSalvo..Get the picture ??
4,Bravo!,A great Indie remake most definitely worth seing.Mauro Lannini's performance is excellent and I would want to see more of his work in the future.Bravo !
3,A little Trifle,"This retelling of an old folk tale is worth one read. The style is more like the original than Norton's usual work. The only reason to purchase it (and I did) is for completeness of an Andre Norton library. At 96 pages, the price can be very steep."
2,"The only Tits in this book are on the front page, so don't bother","I don't know much about families. While this book did have a very interesting part about how to resurrect the ghosts of your dead family, it had nothing about how to get rid of them again. They're still living in my basement. Other than that there's a pretty nice section in the middle of the book with pictures of families. You can tell that they're dead because the photos are in black and white. Remember, color is the vibrancy of life."
5,Brautigan fans,Will find her insight very interesting. I work with a music theory faculty member who wanted to write an opera based on Brautigan's works and she refused the rights... I gave him this book to help him understand why.
4,"More about her than him, but good","Ianthe is the daughter of Richard Brautigan, although this book is more her personal story of overcoming her father's suicide than a biography of him. I would have preferred the latter. Still, you get a good, if incomplete portrait of Richard Brautigan through the eyes of the person closest to him. You get to know his multi-faceted personality, including his tragic drinking habit, but never understand his life or what drove him to suicide (nobody, including his daughter, knows). Some great stories about the last of the beats. I think my favorite was when he sat with a friend in his Montana cabin and shot out the hours on the clock, each hour on the hour, with his handgun."
5,"""You Can't Catch Death""","An ardent introspective of a loving father and maverick writer.Ianthe Brautigan brings forth the complexity and tenderness past biographies and articles have lacked.She peels away the ambigous hazy portrait of this profound and innovative writer, and elicites a faithful,candid memoir that details his faults and quirks as only she can.Weaving us back and forth through time,she evokes his mind tickling prose hand in hand with the dark mordant wit of his writings.A memorable, healing and thought provoking book that faces loss,and suicide up front and barenaked.Brautigan rises to the occasion and her writing style stands tall on it's own!Encapturing, a must read!"
5,Swingin!,"Wow! Fantastic arrangements and the band plays the heck out of them. These guys are so tight and they play with such feel. Drummer Harry Himles gives the band the power, energy and heart that carries them to their super sound. I've seen Himles play many times in the Atlantic City area and he's definitely the BEST drummer I've ever seen!"
5,"Swingin', Really Swingin' !","These tracks are as good as any I've ever listened to. There is unquestionable evidence of arrangement talent that simply sparkles. It's been some time since I've heard examples of such delicate balances when less is more, and when more is better. The players are outstanding. Solo work just a tad shy here and there, but that's jazz, right? On a scale of 1 to 100, how about a 101! Great job!"
4,For Careful Readers Only,"Noel has once again written an astrological text based on his extensive research. It's important to note that this book is simply not for those who want an instant answer. You will have to READ the book and admit that more study is needed. Noel breaks new ground by introducing the Quindecile and the importance of the 12th house. Anytime someone discovers something new, it warrants study. In spite of the lack of clarity in parts, a careful read will deliver a far better understanding of medical astrology than any other text in print. This is an absolute must have on any astrologer's shelf. This is a job very well done! ...hopefully a sequel is in the works!"
2,Interesting but pedantic and overblown,"This book presents interesting case histories and studies of small groups of people with the same illness from an astrological point of view. The book could have used a good editor because the writing is often dense and overly verbose and pendantic so that the main points get lost in the verbiage. I think the book is worth reading, but it is hard-going and confusing in many parts."
4,Very good primer for the intermediate-level astrology studen,"Astrological Timing of Critical Illness provides excellent and timely example charts for review as one follows the step-by-step process Tyl uses to track the first warning signs of a variety of serious illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and cancer. Well worth it's jacket price. The author's style of writing is clear, concise, and as usual, elegant in form and structure, if occasionally a bit pedantic. Most refreshing of all, the book is written with an intelligent general public in mind, in what appears to be a sincere effort to reach a far wider audience, and perhaps be truly helpful in the early detection of what most of us consider to be both life altering and life threatening illnesses."
2,awful acting,"Just horrible, embarrassing acting kept me from continuing past the first half hour. Who are the people who gave five stars? Religious mini-intellects? It's scary how indoctrinated the mega-churchites are."
2,Just believe in what? No mention of God.,"I bought this movie because of the reviews on here that were so overwhelmingly positive. Some of the other reviews on here mention God and give off the idea that this is a Christian film but they never once mention God, so when they say ""Just Believe"" you're left to wonder are they referring to believing in God, one's self, or something else entirely. I guess it's just me but this movie leaves a lot to be desired. I loved the story line behind the movie but it leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions. The story line needs a lot more development. This really could have been a much better film with more character development. You kinda feel like it starts in the middle and abruptly ends. It was a clean movie and we need more of those but there are much better Christian family friendly movies out there for the price."
1,Chick flick extreme ....,Chick flick extreme .... if you like that kind of thing this is your movie ... drove me crazy .... had to switch it off ... ugh ...
3,Soil,From the soil we come & to the soil we shall return. Everything we try to influence forgetting the soil is forgetting cause and addressing the problem.
2,Founder,"I bought this book thrusting the reviewers' stars and was hoping to come out with some practical methods to improve the hoof of my horse and to prevent further problems. But this is not neither ""how to"" hoof care book (as stated in the book) nor a book for beginner, as there is not even an illustration defining the different parts of the hoof and if your are not already an expert, you can not figure out clearly what is said and written. Also I don't like the statement ""see resources to find out more in one of my other books."" and don't feel comfortable to buy another book of this author, fearing to face the same statement."
1,Founder,I have not yet received this book although it was ordered on the 15th June.What has happened?
5,Great Book,I have many books on founder and laminitis- Having a pony that has had and got founder again it really helped me with the right path and makes total sense. Excited to see the results as she is already walking better now.
5,a miracle!,"This book has literaly been a life saver! I was told that my serevely neglected 20 yr old Assateague pony would never walk again and that the humane thing to do would be to put him down. he had 90% rotation in both front feet and could only stand for an hour at a time. he is now comfortable, walking, and is on his way to being sound to ride! this book gave us hope that there is a better way to treat foundered horses and that even the most severe cases are reversable. it is a long road, with no overnight cures, but the results are more than worth it. never give up hope!"
5,"Wonderful Book. ""Must have"" for foundered horses/ponies.","This book was wonderful. Very helpful and informative. Much of the book is now highlighted with information I will refer back to. Tried the suggestion for treating ""White Line Disease"" and it appears to help. For years I have withstood the ""shoes are necessary"" thought process so often presented, and have only had shoes put on a couple of times under a strong recommendation of a vet(for a quarter crack.) Now there is documented evidence that my thoughts were not incorrect. THANK YOU! Because of the quality of this book, I have just ordered Jaime's (3) DVD's on Natural Horse Trims. While a little nervous about starting this process myself, if his videos are as good as his book, I'm sure it will work out. I definitly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve the health and well-being of their horses."
3,Just another cup,This is an ok cup for first time users with small amounts of liquid in it. My daughter liked the soft spout. She will outgrow this one soon though due to the size.
1,maybe i cleaned it wrong....,"I bought this sippy cup seeing how informative the review was.. and I was happy when i saw it and my baby liked it..But whn i went to wash it, i cleaned the valve, by removin a obvious piece that had to be removed to clean... and it never was able to attach corrctly it will fall in her drink and completely get my babys face all wet so after ONE use i had to discard it... maybe it was defected but i was not satisfied with it."

4,Fine illos by one of the Old Masters,"Vincent di Fate's baroque ""star castle"" spaceships, forex [...] are instantly recognizable to any regular SF reader -- he's known as a 'gadget man', and rather laments his typecasting -- especially since he doesn't get to paint as many pretty girls as he would like.Di Fate started illustrating for Analog some 30 years ago, and it was a real trip down Memory Lane to see the old magazine illos....Lots more samples at di Fate's nice website: vincentdifate[dot]comRecommended for SF art fans.Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
2,John's read,"The artwork was done too small. No variety in the book including the artwork. Larger artwork was didvided by the bindings over multiple pages, that gave the artwork a divided look. Far too many sketches and not enough finished products."
1,Shame on Altissimo!!,"A very poor compilation CD consisting of legally pirated recordings that are normally offered to the public for free directly from the military. Military performers here in Washington resent what Altissimo does in this and other recordings. More importantly, the recordings were never meant to be placed on commercial CDs and thus the recording quality is terribly inconsistent. Many other patriotic CD's are much much better. For great patriotic music try the compilation of Sousa marches by the Eastman Wind Ensemble on Mercury or the Robert Shaw Chorale on RCA, the Morman Tabernacle on SONY or the Washington Men's Camerata on Gothic and SONY. Whatever you do - don't waste your money on this recording."
5,Best soap we've ever tried,"Everyone in our house loves this soap! Compared to the generic stuff you find in stores, this soap is not comparable."
1,BROKEN LANCE,"Lance Henriksen can't sink much lower than this pitiful attempt to cash in on THE DA VINCI CODE.What's wrong with this snoozefest? EVERYTHING!!!*Horrible direction--from the endless use of ineffectual freeze frames to the red-draped camera work.*Laughable acting. C Thomas Howell is not Harrison Ford. He's not even Casper van Dien!*Some of the worst action sequences on film.*Does anyone care how tall characters are?*The movie was filmed at private residences in Southern California, not London, Milan or Afghanistan!!Don't waste your time--it's too valuable."
2,Scrappy condition,"This book arrived about as close to cut-off date as possible in far worse condition than described by seller. It was, however, too late to return for another, as it was meant to be an xmas gift I was shipping to my father-in-law in Ireland, & was already well past xmas. It was nothing more than an old, used, yellowing/partly torn library book, complete w/library card envelope intact, & in scrappy condition, at best."
5,Carson is tops,"I had never heard of Carson several years back when I was looking for a good pair of moderately prices 7x35's to have by my 2nd story porch overlooking the ICW. They turned out to be outstanding. Since then I have bought another pair for the downstairs den and this small pair to have in the truck. I still don't hear much about Carson, but these products are tops - the image is sharp all the way out to the edge in every pair and the construction is battleship solid."
5,This book should be a must read in every high school.,Victor Kravchenko is a very good writer and a very amazing & exceptional person to live through what he experienced in the USSR. The communism system that he experienced and observed was insane. Somehow people have come out of that system to testify to the West. If only we could and would listen. After reading this there will be doubts about the insanity that the Russian people had to endure under Communism.
4,"pleasant, sentimental journey","""On the road"" in Cuba. A nice sentimental journey with lots of traveler's problems to keep it interesting and underscore the harness of traveling in a rather undeveloped country. A pleasant peek into some Cuban lives and that touched on the emotional conflicts in someone (Cuban raised in Miami) who had been detached from his roots.I wish we had seen more variety of the landscape, but still it was good. I also wish that the print had been better and the subtitles more clear, but that was acceptable.I think it stayed away from politics, contrary to some comments here. Cuba was presented as very poor, but there was no blaming either of the US or of the Castro government. It stayed focused on the characters and the atmosphere of the road."
3,So So,"The people were not as ""size appropriate"" as I felt I was led to believe. I think they are too small for the doll house. They do not stand up on own nor do they bend to sit. They seem to work best when resting in the bed!"
2,Not As Good As Marketed,"I love the Halo franchise, however both Halo 2 and Halo 3 were a let down in My opinion. As far as the Legendary package goes, there wasn't enough included with it for the price that was being asked for it. The helmet could have been bigger. Halo 3, from what I've read from all of the books about the games, is actually the other half of Halo 2, so Bungie and Microsoft sold us out for game content and story plot.Where's the rest of the story? I personally preferred Halo : Combat Evolved over these 2nd and 3rd games. I plan on making my own Master Chief helmet with the one from the Legendary package utilizing resin and clay."
5,Great Game--Great Deal!!,"Great deal from Amazon! This game was at the top of the kids Christmas list and they never expected to receive the legendary edition. I never would have purchased it if it wasn't such a great price. Very Cool and it sparked my recent addiction to Amazon's daily deals! I don't play the game myself, but I haven't seen the kids for 3 days as they've been playing non-stop!"
4,good price better game,"i pickedup the halo legendary edition for a savings of 70dollarsat amazon. cant get an better then that,and oh what a great game."
5,awesome,"Halo as never seized to amaze me.With each game the graphics get better and the story grows stronger,Not to mention it come with a spartan helmet!Sadly it is not wearable unless you modify it.If you are a halo fan,this is a definite must.But if you want to buy it to wear it then this is not for you.Halo just gets better and better."
4,For my Kids.,This game is for my kids and they love it and think the hole halo helmet thing is really cool to.
4,"Great collector's item, but average game...","The extras in this game are phenomenal. The helmet reproduction is fairly large and is a great centerpiece for any gameroom. It also serves as a disc holder. Additionally, there are designer and production stuff, and extra themes and gamerpics. Now to Halo 3, the game itself...the game is basically an extension of Halo 2 with prettier graphics. Overall, if you buy it for the extras and the helmet, you will be happy, but if you buy it for Halo 3, prepare to be somewhat underwhelmed and maybe disappointed."
3,Very cool package,"The package is cool, but I was expecting a little more in terms of bonus materials. The story was ok good ending to the series."
3,Excellent game... For the 15 mins it lasted.,"I know this will probably ruffle alot of feathers but I have to say that i'm not very happy with this penultimate edition of the Halo series. Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound and even the story was very good. No complaints there. But it just seemed to me that the whole game took about half as long as the previous games to play. Where I felt the game should just be getting started, it was over. Granted, i played the game on the normal difficulty. But i believe the only reason that the gameplay would be longer on legendary would be because I would have to reload three times as often. I just remember playing the first Halo for what seemed like a month... and for Halo 3 it took 2 days. Enjoyable game, which I'm sure will give me hours of enjoyment thru Multiplayer (love odd ball) but otherwise, the story mode and the length of the game came up short for me. By 3 weeks."
5,why you should buy,halo 3 legendary edition is the most have game of the year not only cause what it has but it can make for a great gift idea for the holidays holding every thing you need to finish the fight with the master chief and the scale replica of his helmet I know your gona love it.
5,halo 3,"This game is very well put together. If you have not read or played the games or read the books. This game my seemed a little odd. The story line is very good if you have been following it. This halo 3 is not as long as the first two, but it does tie the series together with a good ending. Plus like most good stories they do leave an open ended where they can do another one maybe in about 2 years. Over all this game and product is good. For parents who think this game is to mature you are wrong. This game compared to games like Fear, KILLZONE, Doom and a few just like it. Halo is mild..."
4,Halo 3,M$ does it yet again! buys a company that makes a successful game and markets the daylights out of it...it is a lot of fun and the graphics are stunning on an HD TV. New weapons and vehicles make the game a bit different but it's still kill all the aliens...well the bad ones anyway...I was really hoping that the helmet would fit my little monkey's head but the opening is only large enough to fit the stand...guess it's time for the dremel tool
1,A book for those NOT wanting to become a CNA,"I must say that this is easily one of the worst books I have ever read. It contains jokes, a very stupid story about setting up a Novell Network to save the world, and miles of other garbage that you must shovel out of the way in order to find any facts. The sample test at the end was not only poorly made and unrepresentative of Novell's test, but it also contains many errors, giving you incorrect answers to some questions. Please, take my advice and buy another CNA preparation book."
1,The Worst of the Worst,"If you think this book will prepare you for the Service and Support 5 exam, think again. I took the exam and found out that the book was full of holes. Even worse, it came with software, which turned out to be defective and when I complained, I was not compensated. Save your money!"
1,Yet another smarmy offering from DJC the Fourth,"I am amazed that people actually rate this guy's text. If only I could give less than one star ! If you're studying for an exam, you want FACTS, not quizzes, crosswords and 'jokes'. If you could take out the 'fluff' this book would be 50% smaller and 100% less irritating. And one final point - proof-reading should be a must when you're supplying study guides."
3,Pumping Height,"The pump works fine, quiet and consistent. However, keep in mind that it cannot overcome heights greater than about 1.5 feet. The flow drops off drastically (trickles) if you are using the pump to re-circulate water in any loop with vertical sections. (See customer image for chart with Danner Pump flow rates AND maximum pumping height)"
1,Not Worth It,"I bought three other books at the same time as this one, and this one was one of the worse ones. I did not feel it gave an adequate amount of information on the methods compared to the other books I bought. I don't even think this was a good book as a supplemental to the more in-depth ones. It went to Value Village immediately.The other books I bought were:Taking Charge of Your Fertility (Weschler) - definately the best resource for this; very in-depth and lots of information; definately my go to book;The New No-Pill No-Risk Birth Control - not as good as Taking Charge of Your Fertility, but had good supplemental information and also would be fine as a stand-alone book;Honoring Our Cycles: A Natural Family Planning Workbook - Waste of money! Worst of the four I bought. It seemed as if it was written for a sixth grader who had never learned anything about the reproductive system. Really annoyed me and I didn't even make it through the first couple of pages before tossing it."
5,Every woman should own this book!!,This is an extraordinary book. Every woman should own a copy. I still don't understand why we are not taught about our own bodies since childhood. If this was the case there wouldn't be so many unplanned pregnancies. Not only that but we wouldn't have to put harsh chemicals into our bodies to avoid pregnancy.
3,Just ok.,"Not the greatest book on the subject. I didn't find this book to be up to date. I bought it to learn more about the after effects of being on ""the pill,"" and achieving conception; it was not beneficial. It needs more content in regards to this subject matter. As well, it sounded like the author was not certain about the subject matter and the effectiveness of the recommended procedures for conception or to avoid conception. A friend who was using the book for just the opposite reason, to avoid pregnancy recommended it to me, and she enjoyed it. I think the book sways more towards how to avoid conception than how to achieve it."
5,Your Fertility Signals,"After several years of being on ""the pill"", I was sick of the side effects. We had purchased ""Your Fertility Signals"" years ago, but had not read the book in it's entirety. Four months ago I read the book and shared varying parts with my husband, who was eary of seeking alternatives, however after both of us learned to participate in monitoring my fertility signals he bought in to the program! We recently completed our fourth month of pregnancy free naturally!"
1,More like spagetti,"Buckwheat is one of the last of the listed ingredients and they are somewhat pasty as a result, not nutty as you would expect. They were the least expensive, but if you like the taste of soba, you're better off to get ones that have more buckwheat."
4,Annie Chun's Soba Noodles,I have only given this product 4 stars because it contains wheat and is not all buckwheat; I did not find that information when I located the product. I am keeping what I bought and will eat it sparingly because of the wheat but it is a good-tasting pasta. I will share it with friends who do not share my sensitivities and do better research next time.
5,You'd think they were made in Japan,"I didn't want to buy these when I noticed that they were manufactured in the US (plus, Annie Chun is Korean so I wondered how authentic her Japanese soba would be). However, the price was good so I decided to try them. They're actually fantastic-- good flavor & just the right amount of chewiness. These work well on their own, for yakisoba or soba soup. I can't tell the difference from noodles I used to eat at stand-up soba places in Koriyama."
4,"good general purpose noodle, but way too expensive here","I like these noodles. They cook quickly. The buckwheat gives them a little more flavor than common spaghetti noodles. For a simple one-dish meal, serve some stir-fried meat and vegetables on top of a bed of soba noodles.Just be careful of the price. Similar quality soba noodles cost less than $2 per pound at local grocery stores. Amazon's price is sometimes better, but usually not."
3,Chewy and salty,"Annie Chun's Soba Japanese Noodles, 12oz. These noodles were just ok for me. I much prefer the texture of Hakubaku organic soba noodles. I think its their size as they cook up differently. But the real deciding factor for me is the salt content, 390mg making it a daily value of 15%, as Hakubaku is a mere 0.1mg"
4,"Good, Clean Family Fun ...","... Not. But this book is fun. As an Army vet, I found that the depiction of military life was compelling and accurate; the way in which the purity of action, in terms of achieving the military goals, mixes with the vulgarity of desire, in this case the impending good times promised by the Phillipines, results in good comic effect. Young never lets his characters lapse into caricature, however, which is a grace not often found in picaresque writing.The regularity of the prose, awfully plain at times, is an interesting attribute of the book. It's the talk of the twelve-step program, the desperate grab for common nouns and regular activity in the hopes that the world will start making sense. That Miles is able to do so in the topsy-turvy world of acronyms, parties and belligerent cpo's is all the more admirable."
2,"Great premise, not so great writing","The premise of this book is interesting and the first few pages were both well written, and very promising. Unfortunately, the writing deteriorated through the rest of the book. There were too many run-on sentences and obvious strains of effort in putting together the dialog. A book is generally not worth reading when one starts to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed for the author. I'm not objecting to the premise or language of the book but to the quality of the writing which simply wasn't very good.Oddly enough I first encountered this book when its creator sent me an unsolicited email message urging me to read it. Receiving spam is obnoxious enough in itself, but receiving heaps of self-praise and frantic requests to buy a marginally written work is just sad."
5,Ship Ahoy!,"One of the Guys is a deeply symbolic book masked by an outrageously funny tale about a guy trying to find good in himself and finally being comfortable with who he is. If you like quality literature that is superbly written, a book where there's a lot more going on in each scene besides the obvious storyline, or if you just want to read a funny book that'll make you laugh your...[head] off, then buy this book!"
5,"Relevant, atypical, accurate, entertaining!","Maybe it is my cynicism, maybe my life experiences, but this book grabbed me from the begining to the end. It is irrelevant if the ending is good or bad or that the events are contrived, what is relevant is that this book accurately reflects institutional life. In fact if you were ever in college, the military, law enforcement, you will relate to the circumstances, language, and environment. It is great. Read it. I hoped it would never end. Thank you Mr. Young."
5,The Best Story on My Summer Reading List,"I picked up ""One of the Guys"" at the bookstore last Sunday. I read the first chapter while waiting for coffee and I couldn't put it down. What a triumph for Robert Young. I hope we will all have more of his work on the shelves soon. Congratulations, Mr. Young."
1,self-indulgent rambling drivel,"I suppose there is a certain readership that may be piqued by this book's ridiculous (and thoroughly disgusting) premise. I don't belong to it, but I perserved anyway. Well, as Truman Capote once trenchantly remarked about a novel much more worthy than this (one I like, actually), this isn't writing; this is typing."
4,"A good, somewhat profane look at the Navy","Robert Clark Young has written a throughly enjoyable book. Parts hilarious, parts sublime, often profane (of course one would expect profanity from sailors.....) in language and treatment of serious issues. While not monumemtal in scope, it never the less deals with the issues it touches upon with grace and style. While the premise sometimes stretches credibility, it does not do so to great extent. Never having been in the Navy, I probably did not enjoy it as much as one who has gone through the experience would. I recommend it."
3,"Decent book., not a very interesting plot","I found this to be a very average book, it is a good read but not very gripping. You can feel the difference when you can't bear to put a book down its so great, this is not that kind of book. It is an ok book but in my opinion it is not the great book others have described it as."
1,I object to the language in this book!,"I've read thousands of books, and I don't usually object to much, but this book was TOO MUCH, and I object to a story that needs a steady stream of foul language to tell it. The first few chapters had me thinking this was going to be a great book, it didn't turn out that way. By page 102, I was skipping pages-and-pages of text, because I couldn't stand the language. That isn't good reading, at least it's not for me. I gave up, read the last few pages, and immediately put this book away. I'm sorry the Author didn't warn me, perhaps I would have seen things differently. But, I doubt it! END"
4,Great Book for Engineers,"I'am primarily a VLSI design engineer who is working on a product involving digital control. The book by Franklin and co. helped me get off to a quick start. It has a lot of practical examples which will be useful to engineers. It teaches the underlying theory , proposes a method to solve problems and also gives the appropriate MATLAB commands. However , personally I'am not able to get a solid grasp of the material by reading this book alone. For a more complete and rigorous coverage I recommend Discrete Control by Benjamin Kuo."
2,Accusplit Finger Hold Tally Counter,"I really cannot state how well the AccusplitAL608 Finger Hold Tally Counter works. When I removed it from the plastic sealed package, it fell apart in many pieces. This particular item was poorly constructed. I sent it back for a refund."
2,Cheap in cost and quality,"I bought 4 of these for counting reps when doing physical therapy exercises. They're great for that purpose--when they work. I was glad I bought so many at once since 2 of them stopped working within 6 weeks of use. One of them got hung up on the ""1"" in the units column (column on the right). The other would not count up unless you pushed the button at a precise angle. I didn't return them since it would have cost almost as much for shipping and handling as the units were worth. Unfortunately, there isn't much choice out there unless you go to an electronic counter."
4,"Good, and it works!","I bought this to use for counting paces (steps) while working outside in the field.. and it works perfect for that!The casing is sturdy enough that I can hike around with it without feeling I am going to squeeze it apart... thats a good thing!Being right handed, I naturally put this in my right hand... but for counting tallies, it goes in the left hand! (just a note for any left handers... its not changeable!)My counter numbers are not centered in the window... it almost cuts the 1000ths digit off, but it is still perfect readable from an angle.Has worked great for me so far."
1,Broke the first day I used it,My review title says it all. I should have listed to the other bad reviews and purchased a different counter. This didn't even last an hour before it started counting by 10's and hundred's.
1,Poor Quality,"This is really disappointing. The last counter had lasted over 7 years before it finally broke. Unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky this time. I bought two, one has a spare. The first fell apart as soon as I opened the package and the second stopped working a month after I bought it....I think i'll try a different brand and hopefully will have better luck."
5,Everything you could ask for in a tally counter.,"This thing works perfectly... a very satisfying click noise with each tally, seems durable, easy to reset, etc."
4,very good considering price,"I bought one of these to keep track of my exercise rep's, that is until my wife borrowed it to use as a stitch counter for her knitting...hmmmm!, anyway, build quality is good, maybe slightly tinny, but given its price, it's well worth putting up with 'good' rather than 'exceptional' build quality. A really good, well engineered click-counter can cost up to and over a hundred bucks. Sure, it would be nice if it were a fraction smaller too, but yet again - you pay your money and so you take your choice, and fwiw, the knitting stitch counter my wife uses cost three times as much and wasn't/isn't half as good as this. Unless you need one professionally, one that's going to be used day and night, this will more than suffice for most situations."
3,Not What I Expected,"The one I got works well. There were no problems with it, per say, but I was expecting something different. I hook this to my belt and I use it to count when I'm loading cars. Customers like to strike up a conversation and I lose track constantly. One of the biggest problems is that the counting button can be easily pushed in by accident. The other major disappointment is that it's not spring-loaded. That thing on the side isn't a button but a nob that you have to rotate all the way around to reset. For this price I expected better quality, and, while it serves its function, it doesn't impress on any other level."
5,nice working counter,This counter works really well. Is fits comfortably in either hand and clicks easily. Reseting is a snap. Great product.
1,"Jams consistently, worthless","Looking at the other reviews maybe I got a dud, but testing it right out of the box the unit consistently failed to register when I pressed the button. I tried different quickness and pressures in my pressing but it still failed and often enough to make the unit worthless to me. This is the second counter I've purchased from Amazon in a week (other one was Coach Dave's Pitch Count Model 300) that is worthless due to low reliability--I can do better counting on my fingers!"
1,Useless Piece of Junk,"This tally counter fell apart after a week of use (I mean, literally fell apart). So cheaply made that the box it came in must be worth more."
1,Bad,"The return tab did not work. Took it apart and found the return mechanism was broke, probably during assembly. Too much hastle to deal with so just dumped it into the garbage."
2,Great for Photos but Lacking In Text,"This book has tons and tons of photos of Bruce Lee but very little text information about Bruce and his life. It is a good overview but I was hoping for something a lot more substantial, especially interviews and such with those who knew and worked with Bruce."
5,Good Buy,Good CF Card. Not much to say other than it does what it's supposed to do. Faster than my 1GB's.
5,A surprisingly satisfying trip,"John McPhee is a writer who seems able to interest readers in anything that captures his attention. The range of subjects that his books cover is striking and his skill at involving readers in subjects that they might heretofore have thought uninteresting is, in my opinion, unique. This book, recounting a journey through Alaska - as a pretext for broader commentary about Alaska and its relationship with the lower 48 - is an excellent introduction to the state we only think we know. I read this during a long stretch of living and working in Alaska and found it to be the most insightful and interesting book on the subject that I had found. As is true with all of McPhee's books, this one satisfys on many levels, from the clarity of the prose to the fascinating subject matter. Great stuff."
5,McPhee on Alaska,"My wife and I like to listen to a tape while we read the book. We are rereading this book that way. It is a classic and a good introduction to Alaska, where we have lived and worked and touristed."
5,Going Into Alaska,"I bought this book as a way to get to know Alaska a little bit before a cruise this summer up the Inside Passage. While it is arguably a little dated - it was written in the 70s - I found the history, background and flavor to be fascinating and valuable. As I was flying over the Susitna River to Mt McKinley, I could see the geological features that made it an unsuitable but still desirable location for a new Alaskan capital.Alaska is, if nothing else, a big place, and this book, by examing three parts of the state, gives you a sense of the land and the people like nothing - except going there - does.John McPhee is a wonderful writer, and I would read - and recommend - anything of his. (Do yourself a favor, though, and stay away from Michener's ""Alaska."" By the time I got from the moving of the landmasses up to the wooly mammoths and saber tooth tigers - still about 10,000 years ago - I was so bored I quit.)"
5,Coming into the Country,"As always< John McPhee takes his reader on a journey. He brings the history and the setting to life. Amazing insights into the heart of the ""whos"" of Alaska!"
5,"AK is all of its quirkiness, described as only someone as talented as McPhee could do","one of the three books that i always recommend to folks i know who are either travelling to, or moving to Alaska.McPhee is great. If you like this, then read Birchback Canoe and Control of Nature."
5,Elegant factual writing,"This is an elegant work of factual writing -- not fancy or pretentious, but intricate, charming and strong. John McPhee is a master."
4,ok for meditation background,"The sound quality is good. The music is really best as background for meditation or sleeping, as it is very repetative. Value received."
2,not so good,I actually was never able to receive this as I cannot access it for what ever reason SO I cannot rate it.Not too happy with the MP-3 download process.
3,"Um, NOT submersible","First time I sank these lights at the boat ramp, they blew out a bulb. I did my best to coat the foam gaskets with a sealant caulk, but the lights leak no matter what. Drilled holes in the bottom of the cases to let them drain, make SURE to keep unhooking your lights every time you use the ramp if you purchase these."
5,Beautiful and Graceful,"This is a beautiful film. It's a spot on treatment on how people, particularly men, interact with a virginal young beauty. The Italian countryside is so beautiful. The flow of the film is slow and dreamy. What I loved about the characters is that they are all human and full of flaws like everybody else. I first watched this film when I was sixteen and now several years later it is just as stunning."
2,lame-o,"It's like a dirty old trust-fund man's film, licking his lazy, narcissistic chops over the coltish, not-spectacularly talented Liv. Reasonably pretty in a banal way, but there's an awful lot of near-inadvertently campy, jaded-bohemian carrying on (which, admittedly, has its appeal). Rachel Weisz makes an appealing debut, though. If you're eager to sample the magic of Bertolucci, skip this and try ""Last Tango,"" ""The Spider's Strategem,"" ""The Conformist,"" or ""Before the Revolution."""
2,"""Quick! Come and wake me up!""","It's about this girl who pricks her finger on a spinning wheel, falls asleep and wakes up with incurable kleptomania. (What, they couldn't get Winona Ryder to star?)Okay, I lied. The movie's not really about that. I only wish it were about that, because then it might be fun trash instead of plain, boring trash. Although _Stealing Beauty_ pretends to offer profound truths about sexual liberation, it's really just interested in scoping out the chicks and the scenery. Still, the photography is nice."
1,Stealing my money,"Slow boring plot, other than 2 brief nude scenes, this movie is about as slow as it gets. Not really a story line to this and the actors who are top notch are wasted. Not an NC-17 movie.. other than a guy shows his Johnson for a VERY short time and so fast you would have to be superman to see it.. (Yeah I guess you ladies could freeze frame it)"
1,Utter Disappointment,"This oversexed movie lacks in depth, soul and substance. In fact, this was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I was bored half-way through the movie since Lucy did nothing else but bounce from one man to the next while one of them was half-disgusted with her behavior, but also attracted to her. Of course, they end up having sex in the end.Story line was incredibly predictable.If you are looking forward to being bored, or if you just likepretty pictures I recommend this movie."
5,City Kid,"This movie is erotic in every way but more than that it appeals to all the senses. Tremendous acting, plausible story line, lush country side scenery, interesting insight into the lives and minds of real artists living the lives of real artists with all their human frailties, intense and interesting relationships that variously develop, restore, and erode into oblivion. Excellent movie on all levels and for the life of me I cannot figure why the price of this DVD is so cheap."
4,Tuscany Blooms Another,"This is a wonderfully shot film that stars Liv Tyler, and other notable actors such as Jeremy Irons. It is a typical coming of age story, set in the middle of a beautiful Tuscan landscape. Living in an almost hippy commune full of artists and writers, Tyler tries to find herself and most importantly become a woman and lose her virginity. Under the guidance of Irons, she learns more about men, life and it's brevity. Her true dream is to reunite with her childhood love, but as in real life, she finds that sometimes things are better left in one's imagination. Instead she finds what she was most looking for is right there practically under her nose. With a great soundtrack that includes the music of Portishead, I recommend this film highly."
4,Stealing Beauty DVD,"Excellent film if you ask me. I love artistic movies, and this is definitely a feast for your eyes. I love it when I am involved in a story, and I feel like I am walking beside the main character throughout, and this film achieves that feeling. Basic stuff inside though, young person coming of age, albeit a worldly female, it's still basically a coming of age film."
5,stunningly beautiful,"this movie was the best movie I have seen in ages. I thought that it was filmed amazingly well, and the scenery was soo lavish and so perfect. Cast well. The characters are all diverse, and you can easily relate to their story. I love this film."
5,A Masterpiece,"I saw this film on Bravo maybe a year ago, tuning in about halfway though. Howver, I've never been able to forget it. The sensual, mysterious beauty of this film is just that: unforgettable. I've never been as touched by a movie as I was by this. The movie itself is so delicate, so fragile. You have the feeling you've just entered through the eye of a needle, as if you've entered a place so untouchable, so fragile, that it is almost impossible to acheive. This film is a masterpiece, a fusion of love, lust, beauty and sensuality. It touches you in a way you'd never expected, giving you a window into Liv's soul (I can't remember the name of her character name... once again, I saw this movie a year ago). And into a time in her life which is unique in it's beauty: the time in which her sexuality is blossoming. This precious time, which we don't realize the sheer beauty and specialness of until it's over, happens once in a lifetime, and it is truly a gift to get to revisit it."
3,longing for the sun,"This is a middle of the road film. There is virtually no plot or driving force within it, so if you like your action, this is not for you. However if you are in to Art House, this is worth a look.Stealing Beauty,creates within you a longing for the Tuscan sun. It has an intimate, sentimantal feel to such an extent that you are almost convinced you're stalking Lucy.Plus the acting is great, especially Jeremy Irons' performance. Also if you look closely you may be able to spot Joseph Fiennes (of Shakespeare in love and Elizabeth fame) as christopher.HAPPY VIEWING!!!!!"
2,Lack of Subtitles = Disappointing DVD,"Wonderful film - which is the reason I purchased it on DVD. However, there is a major flaw in the DVD... at least as far as the English speaking audience is concerned. A significant amount of the dialogue is in Italian. The English subtitles only appear when the dialogue is in - you guessed it - English!Not a lot of help.And for the Spanish speaking audience, the Italian dialogue is subtitled, but none of the English...Is this a design flaw or a defect in my DVD ? I don't know for sure but not being able to understand the language makes it difficult to enjoy the film.This is one of my favorite movies - the film itself deserves a great review, but the same cannot be said for this particular DVD."
4,"Beautiful film, flawed DVD","Beautiful film. But my review is not on the film but on the DVD itself.As already mentioned by a previous reviewer, this DVD has no subtitles for the Italian and French dialogue that occurs throughout the film. And if you turn your English subtitles on, translations are still missing. At times it will just say ""(speaking in Italian)."" This gets rather frustrating. Thankfully, I have taped this film previously (which has the translation) - let alone, seen the film a dozen times -and am able to comprehend what has been said. But if you are seeing this film for the first time, at times you will feel lost or not get the true sense of the film.In addition, the DVD menu screen is poorly design and barely readable.Nevertheless, this is a beautifully shot and directed film that must be seen in Widescreen - unfortunately, only availabe on this DVD.And as already mentioned above - one of the best soundtracks."
1,intolerable movie about a girl looking to loose her virginity in Italy,OMG this movie was so bad. I made it through an hour of it before turning it off...couldn't finish it. basically if want to watch a bunch of anglophils living in Italy with a bunch of bored wealthy freeloaders gossip about a gorgeous girl who managed to be a virgin at 18 find a dude to deflower her - this is hte movie for you. I found it full of cliche and I was as bored as all the freeloaders in that villa in Italy.YUCK!
2,Utterly Forgettable,The plot was barely existent. You knew the ending ten minutes into the movie and none of the characters had any depth.
4,Starting to Hear This Soundtrack Apart From the Great Film,"In the film, the music moves the images and concepts along. On its own, it is an amazing collection of stand alone music. I'm glad I purchased and expanded my music collection."
3,Woman's Movie,"In spite of Jeremy Irons and and Bertolucci directing, I was dissapointed in the sentimentality that surrounded this film.Not for everyone. What I would call a ""woman's movie"" and not a high recommendation on my list."
2,Stealing Beauty,"The movie could have been so much more with less caracter's. Liv Tyler is very good. Rachel Weisz is only in the movie for short stints but, memberable ones. The soundtract is better than the film."
1,Liv's (senseless) ticket to stardom.,"Other than Liv Tyler's beauty, there was nothing redeeming about this movie. Sure, Tuscany is beautiful (which is also why Frances Mayes' books are hot sellers these days!!), and Jeremy Irons is a veteran actor of high caliber. The 70s music didn't hurt. Bertolucci's name naturally ""sells"", but when I saw this movie, I was like, WHAT IS THIS???????"
3,stealing beauty,"I found it hard to become involved in this film, very slow. My thought is to give it another chance, sit down and watch it again, if I can?"
3,Shoot 'em up; show 'em off,"A decent Western yarn about Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday and Pat Garrett (with gorgeous scenery supplied by Jane Russell). There is a good story about outlaws and the law here, as well as some of the normal cowboys and breasts stuff and good guys and breasts stuff. Yes, Jane Russell pops up and through often in this movie. . .and I didn't mind one little bit. Just a good shoot 'em up show 'em off film.Never before have I mentioned technical issues with the movies I review. I will here. It was very annoying that there was no attempt to clean up any audio or video problems in the transfer to DVD."
1,The Outlaw,"I have heard of this movie since I was a teen ager (I am now 77).. it was about as sorry a movie as I have ever seen, High school actors could have done better."
2,Homina Homina.,"Yowza! That Jane Russell philly almost makes this slow piece of horse puckey worth sitting through. Almost.(You see, she's kinda hot.)"
2,Hey Janie Babe!,"The only reason this film gets two stars is because of Jane Russell. Howard Hughes was no John Ford. But surprisingly, he wasn't bad as a director. He wasn't good, but he wasn't bad. The only reason to watch this film is for Jane Russell's debut. The script is inane, and the acting by the leads will make you cringe. But bountiful Jane wears low cut tops, and when she bends over -- holy mackeral. And there is more fun to the film in the close-ups Hughes takes of Jane emoting impending sex. Hughes intention was for Jane to be erotic, but the expressions on her face are not of this world. There is no man that has ever seen these facial contortions on a woman. Trust me. Buy a used copy, only for these scenes. It is worth the laugh."
4,Memorable western,"Among the infinite versions of the legend of Billy the Kid, this one is by far the most extraordinary. And I say it for two reasons. The first one is that the film combines three essential elements always present in a good script: love, friendship and treason. Everything's fine between Doc Holliday and Pat Garrett, until Billy the Kid comes up. He steals Doc's horse and, despite of this, Doc becomes his friend and protector, which makes Pat swear to God we will catch both of them. Between the gunmen is the lovely Rio (Jane Russell, in an unforgettable performance), a character too sexy and too provocative for a mid-forties western. Her presence is a guarantee of a bizarre and unexpected love triangle. The second reason is, since this story is a legend, everything is possible, even changing the obvious ending. Maybe you'll get disappointed with the conclusion but certainly it will make you reflect upon the oldest dilemma of mankind: the good and the evil."
3,A budget edition of medium quality,"I found the image quality of this edition (Platinum Disc Corporation) to be varied. The first few minutes seemed jittery and blurred, but then seemed to improve. Maybe I just got used to it. Overall I would rate image quality acceptable in light of the low price. There was also a problem reaching the menu, and I had to play around with the remote for a while to find it.As for the film itself, if you are not familiar with it you might be amused by the way the ever present musical score answers and comments on the dialog. One caveat: don't be misled by the stated 123-minute running time into thinking that this is the uncensored version. The running time, at least on the disk I saw, was 115 minutes, whereas I understand that the uncensored version runs for 117 minutes."
5,The Outlaw,The Outlaw is a great movie with Jane Russell. It's unusual to have a lady as the leading character in this type of movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves Jane Russell.
4,Downright Good,"I'm going to disagree with the ""cheese"" claimers about this movie. I thought it was good. The acting wont win an worldwide award but it's not bad, and there are some funny parts. A light hearted, interesting, fun to watch western."
4,good western,"Considering the 1941 time frame, I thought this was a better than average Western. At no time did historical fact get in the way of the story. The music was typical, the guns, everything was strictly Hollywood, but the acting was pretty good. The main thing is that it is a fun old time cowboy movie and a bargain at the $3.88 price."
3,The Outlaw,"I have seen this movie many times on television, and I must confess that Ishould have taped it instead of purchasing the DVD version from Platinum. The video was jumpy and the menu was very hard to get too. If you plan on buying this DVD, save your money. Budget price also means inferiour poduct!"
3,"It's Billy, you fool","Why this movie isn't one of the top five gay/camp movies of all time I do not know. Jane Russell is window dressing for a barely sublimated love triangle of Pat Garrett, Doc Holiday, and Billy the Kid. Before Billy's horse is tied securely Doc invites Billy to spend the night with him in the Lincoln hotel. By then end of the movie Pat has killed Doc in a rage of jealousy over Billy. In between, Billy and Pat both pick the horse over Jane, and Billy ties her up s&m style, then cuts her down. Reviewers knock the acting here, but it's not bad considering the plot is totally surreal. Who could understand what was going on. Did Howard Hughes??? More likely, this movie is a gazillionaire's home movie fantasy. With all his work on the Spruce Goose, Mr. Hughes had little time in his life for Freud or Jung. Truely amazing and worth more than one watch."
3,This time not better than the VHS version,"If we're talking strictly the movie, then I would give it 5 stars. But if we're talking DVD vs VHS, well, I have the VHS version of The Outlaw and wanted the DVD version. This DVD is very diappointing. It's grainy and dark. I would not buy from this vendor again."
4,A let down from the publicity stills,"Even less than expected... A film directed by Howard Hughes, of all folks, with a bosom as its main featured attraction exhibiting lame acting all around, generic music and notoriety. Gentle reader, you can see more bosom on any girl talk show. It was unclear if this was a serious production or a comedy featuring characters being killed. One reviewer referred to this as the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of cowboy movies. The film did not even live up to the publicity stills. I enjoyed ""Plan 9..."" and would have appreciated a shorter 55 minute version of ""The Outlaw"" such as one of the double features plus cartoon and a newsreel. Here again, this is a film worth seeing once just to know what everyone is talking about.This affordable DVD offers reasonably good quality and sound. Enjoy...or you will never know what you have missed"
4,Loved the Ending,This is the first book by this author that I've read. I wish now I would have started from the beginning so that I would had the background of the characters. I did enjoy how her main character solved the mystery with humor and guts. This book did remind me of the Stephanie Plum series. It's a very quick read and easy to get into. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Better Off Dead,GREAT READ. CHARacters seem to come to life in Katy Munger's descriptions. Recommended for mystery lovers and light reader everywhere.
5,Katy Munger's Better Off Dead,This book is funny and easy reading. I recomend all of Katy Munger books. The book is about a woman detective thatgets jobs no one else really will take. And she loves her job.
4,Very Entertaining,This was the first of the Casey Jones books that I read. I had to go back and read all the others!! She's funny and in-your-face. I can't wait till the next book comes out!!
5,Pow! Glad I Found This Resource,"I highly recommend this book. If you are considering, or even if you are already in the restaurant business, take a look at what this book and set of resources has to offer. I'm glad I found it when I did."
1,Not helpful,This book is poorly organized and full of errors. Several of the sections were written for general businesses--not specific to restaurants. I got the impression that it was put together quickly using sections from other books. I should add that I gave up pretty quickly on this book and so did not read more than one-tenth of it.
2,Bood was ok,The book arrived very late- about 3 weeks after I placed my order. The front cover was torn and there were some holes punched in it. Luckily the pages were clean crisp.
2,Worthless,"I read this book. It did not take long. What is the problem with this book - it does not say anything! There is no point to it. Sure, it is entertaining sometimes, but there is no goal to this book. What was the author trying to achieve? He gives ramblings about why he hates certain people - much like the new book by Bernie Goldberg (which is pure trash) - but does not really say how to fix the problems he says these mostly celebrities create.We need to stop with all these right wing authors writing books with no point other than to slam the opposite party."
4,Exposes all spectrum of people's idiotic character.,"I liked the fact that he was not exposing only liberals, but also conservatives, moderates and those who don't know where they fit in the scope of political occupancy."
1,You cannot advocate for something that you would not do yourself.,"Mike Gallagher was never in the military, and neither are any of his 4 sons (all coming of age in the years of the war on ""terrah""). I wonder why?Does this book answer that question? Does it discuss on what merits he feels entitled to refer to himself as ""the general""?If Mike Gallagher feels that he is ""surrounded by idiots,"" then perhaps he should relocate to Iraq (in whatever capacity that he can serve), to fight for the cause that he is the so-called champion of."
4,A proud conservative,Mike Gallagher is a proud conservative and he is not ashamed to say it. This book is a collection of personal stories about Mike's encounters with various Liberals. It is easy reading and entertaining. His down to earth logic and common sense comes through page after page. He is one of the few celebrities that is not shy from bringing his family and personal lives into the discussion. It is frank and refreshing. I'm glad he is one example where a staunch Conservative can get along with his Liberal spouse. Why can't the politicians in Washington learn a lesson? We can disagree on issues but still get along. Keep up the good fight Mike.
1,Another Whacko!,"Boy, another whacko writes a book. He's right in there with Anne Coulter, Sean Hannity, and what's his name, Limbaugh. These guys must have a ""rejected complex""....Gallagher better stick with what he knows best....nothing. How come he's not wearing his ""uniform"" on the cover, I swear he look just like the late Red Skelton as Clem Kadedalhopper (?)."
1,who's the idiot now?,"While the chickehhawk and his four cowardly sons cower in their motor coach far behind the enemy lines....A radio career lies in tatters.Go blow the automated bugle. This cowardly turkey and 3rd rater is historyBye bye Mikey, you mediocre phony."
1,"The More 1 Stars a Conservative Writer Gets, the better the book!","I just love when my favorite conservative writers/radio commentators have gotten a bunch of 1 star ratings from the mind numbed liberal left, because then I know they've hit a nerve. It does warm my heart to know that so many libs have spent their checks on supporting the works of such greats as Hannity, Rush, Savage, & now Gallagher!! I plan on buying one for all my friends and family for Christmas and so should you!!"
1,How pathetic,That a fading talk show host would be so egotistical as to require his paid radio staff to use fake names to pen hollow 5-star blurbs on Amazon....and then to make them purchase his book in their off-hours to pump up its sales.The book is drivel. The Author is pathetic.
1,Gallagher-no value whatsoever,"Mike Gallagher is a liar. I was on hold for a topic and I was told that they already had enough callers with my opposing point of view. Three minutes later Gallagher says nobody called in to oppose him on the topic!! This liar believes he can get away with that stuff, and he often does. There are postings on the internet of Gallagher also committing blatant lies. Gallagher is a man who believes he is more intellectual then he actually is though. There are 12 year olds who are deeper thinkers then Gallagher. Absolute drivel."
1,"Oh, please","Did you know that when this book is on the shelf in the library, Ann Coulter is on one side and Newt Gingrich is on the other? Yup, surrounded by idiots. Hey, he said it!"
1,Ill effects of being Surrounded by Idiots,"After trying to read this new book by talk show host Mike Gallagher ( I finally did finish it) 2 thing became very obvious, someone who dispises liberals as much as Gallagher must be surrounded by like minded conservatives and spending his life surrounded by idiots is begining to have a sad effect on Mr. Gallagher, this book reads as if it were written by an idiot.I must admit I was pretty sure this book would run the same lines as those written by Mike's commrades, Hannity, Savage, Coulter. Hillary Bad, USA/GOP good. Social programs Bad, USA/GOP good. Liberals Bad, USA/GOP good. Surprise I was right!The bottom line is if you apply a talk show host approach to solving todays complex problems you would have a cure for cancer tomorrow, it's just not that simple. This books low brow title and approach add nothing new to the arguement of how to lead this country. Wait for the paperback release, if there is one."
2,About his views on gays,"Gallagher, did you ever read the Bible? It says right in there that homiosexuality is wrong. But then again probably just for reasons of not wanting to get the gay genral public too mad at him Gallagher claims he is for gay unions just not gay marriages. Both are wrong BudDY. And what is this bit about giving money to strangers who are legally mugging you and you feeling good about it? He has better points when he talks pro-Bush then when he does these two things."
1,The Sleighride Overturned...,"Well, where do I start. I have genuinly never been so dissapointed with a product in my life. Basically this is a hell of a band, doing a good performance, with possibly the worst production team of all time. The sound is up and down, the camera angles are lame, it fades into tracks 30 seconds into them. In Politician, the volume level goes from about 1db to about 120db and then back down about 40 times within 5 minutes, absolutely shocking. I have Mountain bootlegs on DVD from 1978 which are better quality than this! Compared to Sea of Fire from a few years back, this is a complete and total let down. Avoid this at all costs, a complete and utter letdown."
1,Mountain-Live in Texas 2005,Unless you love bootleg footage do not buy this. This was filmed by a camcorder and is of very poor quality. This product is not worth what they are asking for it. It is the band Mountain but it has really poor sound as well as video.
3,I should have read the book!,"Although this was a good story with excellent narration by Lynn Redgrave, this abridged audio tape was ultimately unsatisfying to me. It was hardly the bare bones of the story. So much was cut out that it was difficult for me to understand the motivations for many of the characters' actions. And I really never knew what most of them were feeling.I think that the Airds and Balestrinos probably were really interesting and multi-dimensional people in the book, and I am sorry I did not meet them there!""September"" is a story of love, love lost, and love found. It is also about what we call family, and all the complications, joys, sorrows and let-downs that family brings."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"The only reason I've even made it halfway through this book is that I picked it up for free and, unfortunately, English-language books are hard to come by where I live. But this morning I nearly flung it into the trash because it is so horrible. The plot is basically non-existent (the entire novel turns on the fact that there's going to be a party and all of the women are really excited about buying themselves new dresses)and the writing is abysmal. It's basically nauseatingly romantic pap. It's not even amusing in the way that Harlequin romances or real bodice-rippers are. It's just dull. Most people would probably be able to intuit all this just from the cover design, but I thought I'd issue out a warning for those who sometimes like to ""slum it"" with a brainless novel in the W.C. - this book does not even measure up to W.C. level - unless you've run out of T.P."
3,Lack of plot hurts this book,Rosamunde Pilcher is a wonderful writer to read. September had enjoyable parts but the overall lack of plot does hurt this book. The setting and characters were delightfully explored and Noel's story furthred from what was told in Shell Seekers. It is hard to follow Shell Seekers (a 5-star read).
2,Didn't do it for me.......,"I had to force myself to finish this book, did not feel the connection to the characters like in other prior stories, Winter Solistice made me fall in love with Pilcher's story telling then it came The Shell Seakers and then Coming Home, wow can I find another story that will top these three books. I don't know......."
4,what a nice escape!,"Read your way through Scotland and the characters that live in a small town. Beautiful description of the countryside, interesting and simple story. I enjoyed every minute of this book."
4,You'll long for Scotland,"I received this book as a gift from someone who knew I loved The Shell Seekers. It's different from that book, but the characters are engaging, and the plot is not as obvious as in some romance type novels. The descriptions of Scotland are fabulous!"
1,Did Not Like,"I am sorry to say but I did not like this book at all! If I could, I would not have given it any stars. I read it to the end, thinking it would get better, but it never did for me. I did not like any of the characters and therefore, could not connect or sympathize with them. I thought the book was boring. Every little detail repeated over and over again... ""She opened the door. She walked through the door. She closed the door"". I get it - let's move on. I think this book could have been condensed by at least 100 pages. The book had the potential to be moving, but wasn't. Each time you thought something climatic was about to happen, the writer jumps to another person's story. I felt all the characters in the book were B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just wish I didn't waste my time with this book."
3,"good music, but there is better out there","The music is good- the recording quality isn't, and the performance lacks something to be desired. It's an interesting item to own, but I would recommend looking for other recordings of this music before purchasing this one."
5,Beautiful Voice,Delta has a unique voice. She has a wide vocal range and a very beautiful voice. Her songs have meaning and are uplifting. I am very happy I found out about her in a magazine ad. The price to import her cd's are well worth the extra money. I look forward to her next release.
1,Stinky cat poo,"This cd stinks. I liked her first album, but now i feel that she is trying to be a 'dark' person, and she tries to, but fails miserably. I have heard this cd, and i have looked at the cd booklet. On the back cover, she looks like a dead body, and pale, and yuck. Dont buy it, unless you are a delta freak, who is obsessed with her, and goes on her forum because you are so obsessed"
3,Adult pop,"This is easily described as adult pop. Nothing fast enough that you would imagine a music video w/ choreography, slower songs- understand the comparison to Celine, but this girl is younger and gives the MUSIC a much younger feel. Some of the darker songs could be comparable to Tori Amos's sound. I don't understand why we haven't heard of her here. Don't let terrible one-hit wonder natalie imbrulia influence your opinion on Aussie music. For younger listeners I suggest Lucie Silvas, who has a Christina Aguilara vocal range and, which she doesn't use yet to it's advantage."
2,nog niet gekregen,"ik heb deze dvd nog niet gekregen (hoewel reeds eind oktober besteld), dus kan ik er nog niet over oordelen hoe het is"
1,Takes Blandness To New Heights,I really wanted to like this album but unfortunately it is so bland that it makes an artist such as Clay Aiken look as cutting edge as Green Day. I cannot remember a single song from the album and that's after ten spins. Her last album was OK but this is truly awful. I hear that Sony is repackaging the album for the USA so lets hope they include some hits.
5,Great Album,"This album is so good!!!! All the songs are over 4/5 and they all tell a story. In refrence to the other reviewer, Delta isnt trying to be dark in her music. She just got over cancer, what do you expect. They are all of her true emotions, unlike other singers who are FAKE! And get the real facts about Delta and Brian before you make a fool out of yourself."
5,Melt,"I first heard Delta Goodrem at a friends funeral years ago, he loved her because of her struggle and the fact that she had positive music. Ive been hooked ever since it is rare that you see artist with a positive message that stand aside from all the other mainstream music out there."
4,The world needs more USB drives wearing tight leather!,"Perfect for having a non-geeky, non-plastic USB drive on your person.Connector cap is somewhat unique in that its magnetic. Not necessarily what I would call ""strongly magnetic"", but enough to keep the cap in place until you intentionally remove it.The connector cap slides off as a completely separate piece. (No teather, flap, etc., keeping it connected to the main body.)"
4,"Not Quite The Odyssey, but Still Good","The first Symphony X CD I bought was The Odyssey (features some of the greatest guitar playing ever!) and it remained in my car for months. I was a fan of Dream Theater, so I was surprised to find a new group that was just as talented (Michael Romeo is on fire) and had a singer with a more pleasing voice (sorry Labrie). Ever single song on The Odyssey was good or great, so I waited about a year and then purchased the next popular album called V. While I enjoy this album, some parts more than others, nothing will touch The Odyssey. That being said, these guys need to put out a new album soon. They are heading in the right direction. One more gem of an album and I might kiss Dream Theater goodbye for good. Not!"
5,Atlantis Mythology,"Symphony X has once more amazed me with ""V"". I never thought it could be possible to make such a good work, getting very near to ""Divine Wings"". ""V"" tells the story and the mythology behind Atlantis, and all the lyrics of the 12 musics are based on it. If the lyrics are good enough, then the riff is the best part. Again, Symphony X was very original with the Riff, making it unique using all kinds of samples to fill the music with wonder and awe."
5,First 5 star I've ever listened to,This album is paramount in every aspect. Listening to it is almost as if you are traveling on a long journey. Recommended to anyone that is into good metal or progressive.
3,A true rock symphony but could use better melodies....,"My review may or may not help much, given that there are over 100 others out there, but I felt compelled to try for a helpful opinion anyway. I found this to be very pleasant although it didn't change gears a whole lot. It reminded me a bit of Kansas and Meatloaf performing a long suite together. If I had not read that they were a ""metal"" band, I would not have thought of them as such from this piece. The ""orchestra"" is indeed electronic not a real one, as stated elsewhere, but it is sonically well done and pervades the music well enough that it comes across as a true rock symphony. The notes and booklet are not very ""upscale"" and I think this could be a dynamite band if they would just diversify their melodies a bit more."
1,BOOOORING!,"All right people,I read the reviews, and thought I should get this album. This is a very boring, flat, heartless album, no feeling, no soul, nothing. After a few songs, I could not bear it. I gave this a few more chances, yup, I listened to it at least 5 times thinking perhaps I was distracted. Writing complex riffs and doing stops here and there and adding backvocals is not and should not be a given recipe for prog metal. I have not heard anything not boring in this album except the 1st song, which is unfortunately too short and led me to buy the album. (so, listening to the samples on amazon may mislead you.Beware)How could I know that those 30 seconds were probably the best seconds in the album?"
3,Wicked...almost,"I am a huge progressive metal fan and Symphony X is my favourite band. I have all their albums and, of course, this one is amazing. I have one problem with it, however. ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME!!! While each song is killer on its own, as an album, it is on the weak side because most songs, as I said, are WAY too similar. Where's the originality of Twilight in Olympus or the heavy but variety-filled style of DWOT???? As an SX fan, I like this album but I seriously believe they have maybe hit some sort of rut with this one... I do, however, think the cover art is unrivalled."
5,Nothing but talent here,"I'm still blown away from this band and I've had this cd for a month now. This is probably one of the best proggressive metal albums ever created. The guitar riffs are just crazy! Also the keyboards and drumming is insane. The singer probably drew his influnces from Dio because they sound very similar. If you listen to this CD all the way through you will be stunned and just blown away. This is not for any hardcore metal fan unless you like to give different styles of Metal a try. A lot of people seem to compare Symphony X to Dream Theater and I'm not sure why because both of them have their own sound. I would recommend this to any Prog Metal fan. Buy this, it will make you search for more of their cds!"
5,Unbelievable.,"This has been my favorite (modern) metal band for over a decade, and as much as I love all of their music, this is their best studio album. There are lots of individual songs on other albums that are equal or arguably better than the material on this disc, but taken as a complete, contiguous piece of music (it is a concept album after all), this album is, so far, the band's definite peak. For a point of reference, this concept album is every bit as good as Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime and will be considered a prog classic some day.For the record, there are 5 essential Symphony X albums: Damnation Game, Divine Wings of Tragedy, Twilight Over Olympus, V, and Live on the Edge of Forever (live concert). All of those albums are incredibly worth buying and outstanding from the first down to the last track."
4,My favourite band of the last 15 years,"It seems this band just keeps getting better. While not as good as their follow-up The Odyssey, The New Mythology Suite is definatly a great album. No one has done operatic vocals in rock this well since Queen and this band has one of the greatest guitarists in the history of rock, who is greatly under-rated. The vocals are also up there with the likes of Ian Gillan, Dio, etc. In fact, every band member is brilliant at his instrument. The songs are just a little bit weaker than the Odyssey but still great. Other obvious influences include Kansas and Iron Maidan.i"
5,PROG IS NOT DEAD!,"(sorry, I jacked up my last review). Symphony X is awesome! I always though Prog was dead a long time ago! Shows how much I know! This album is an absolute must have for Prog or Prog-Metal fans. The lyrics as much as the music are ""proggy."" The music has a wide range from classical to metal. The only bad thing is, is the the intstrumental (segue) tracks are way too short. The longest one is like 3 minutes. Those instrumental tracks are amazing. All the harmony stuff is cool. Romeo can pull of some pretty amazing stuff! There is just so excellent musicianship in here, it would take forever! So just go and buy it! In my opinion, is sounds like Yes, ELO, and Metallica rolled into one."
3,Over My Head,"I thought the musicianship on ""V"" was very good (especially on tracks like ""The Death of Balance/Lacrymosa"") but the lyrics went right over my head. If ""V"" was supposed to be a concept album (and I'm not sure if it was), then I never figured out what that might have been."
5,One of their best!,"This album is so great, all of the orchastration, INSANE solos and riffs, awsome vocals, crazy drumming, and crazy bass.That's all i have to say, if u are a symphony x fan, this album is a must.peace"
4,Cool album,Symphony X are a cool band and this is a cool album. Though only 4 stars cause I don't like the vocalist.
3,"Good synopsis, tough introduction","There is no question that Scruton knows his Kant, and this book is a 5-star synopsis of Kant's major ideas, including some of the background and controversies surrounding them.That said, I don't think it will succeed as a first introduction to Kant for most people. If you already know this material, or have known it sometime in the past and want to brush up, then this is the perfect book for you. If you are looking to learn about Kant's ideas for the first time, you are likely to find this book too compressed and telegraphic. I don't doubt that Scruton made a great effort, but it just may not be possible to introduce Kant in this number of pages. For a true introduction, I'd recommend Sebastian Gardner's guidebook in the Routledge series."
4,Only 4 stars because any short introduction doesn't give Kant his due,"It's a pretty good introduction, I'd recommend reading several introductions to Kant before diving in (he's pretty dense). I think Goethe said that reading Kant was like walking into a well-lit room, I hardly think he was talking about Kant's dry, scholastic writing style. The clarity of his thought, however, is pretty intense. I do recommend this book, merely because jumping straight into Kant probably isn't going to fare well. When, and if, you do choose to read Kant, take a look at Jonathan Bennett's website (a philosopher and Kant scholar), I think he translates Kant into more readable English. Early Modern Texts or something. I agree with some of the other commentators, that this introduction is kinda hard for a first time look into Kant. A history of philosophy book might be your best bet to read first. It is pretty good for such a short introduction though. Take your time and don't do it in a day. Digest it. Good luck all."
5,Gother than Thou!,"I am so glad that Tame Downe decided not to rest his laurels and came out with this potent concoction which reads like the ingredients to the sickest most gothic witches brew Bar Sinister and the Pretty Ugly Clubs finest denzines could ever wish to drink of. While purests, may scoff at the Newlydeads infusion of Glam & Dirt Rock into the gothic genre, anybody who grew up in the late 80's should adore this. Grab a clove and a miller and enjoy."
1,"Avoid like the Plaugue... and not in a good goth way, either","This is cheap...rock from the leadsinger of FasterPussycat. It is about as goth as a ham sanwich. I had such high hopes when I picked this one up, but was sadly crestfallen. One would be better off with some nice Cruxshadows, Bauhaus, Voltaire, Bella Morte, or Joy Division CDs. Or maybe even some of the more violent Nick Cave (or any Nick Cave, actually). Just don't bother with this album..."
2,Butterknife Dull,"This collection of stories from 1973 - 1989 are musty, tepid and just plain dull. I expected a lot more from this book. In my opinion, if you're looking for enjoyable travel stories pick up any book by Bill Bryson (except for I'm a Stranger Here Myself)."
2,wolverine is eating my leg,"Terrible writting,This was the first time i bought a book written by mr Cahill.I recommend renting his book if you want to sample his writting but he is very hard to follow with stories that never seem to go anywhere.The book is compose of many short stories and I would have to say that less then 40% of the stories are worth reading."
4,A great collection of near travel disasters,"This is an excellent collection of thoughts and comments on the sheer edge of adventure. Cahill knows exactly how to describe the amazing stupidity of some of these adventure sports in a way that still leaves you interested in participating. Like his previous collection, Jaquars Ripped My Flesh, this book covers the gamut in place and sport, from extreme skiing in Montana to whitewater rafting in India. And while Cahill is a master at adventure writing, when he turns his pen to describing the cultures of some of the more exotic places that he has visited and the difference between their culture and our's, he's both hilarious and profound. This book is a selection of the Vintage Departures series, a group of books that I have found to be uniformly excellent."
3,Has Its Moments,A collection of magazine pieces by travel writer/thrill seeker Cahill that has its moments.
4,Excellent overview,"This book is great for an overview on Fibre Channel: just the nuts and bolts to get started on a SAN or other storage that my company needed to understand fibre and lead us to further, more detailed understanding of the concepts."
4,Perfect little wine journal,"We love this journal. The three ring binder style allowed us to remove the filler pages from wine sections we don't normally drink (blush, dessert) and add those pages to sections we drink often (reds!) Also includes a handy quick-reference chart with definitions of oft-used wine terms.If you are an absolute purist about recording the entire, full label on the bottle this may not be the journal for you. The space for the labels is ample if you are ok with trimming to fit in some instances. The journal is the size of a med-lrg planner so the pages aren't so large that you have tons of space to record tons of info or large labels, for instance.Certainly a good solution for the novice or amateur wine aficionado."
3,Not what I expected after waiting for 4 years,"This CD opens strongly with ""Freed,"" a song that suggests Bonham has matured since her last album was released. Freed is beautiful and melodic. It reminded me of some of Fiona Apple's more soothing music. After that the record seems to be more of a sampler of songs that werent quite good enough to make it onto her first record. The good songs on the record tend to push the feminist thing a bit too strongly, or at least to literally (It gets preachy at times). The rest is mediocre at best, which is a shame, because Bonham is a tremendously talented and dynamic performer. At the end of the day, I would say this is worth having if you really liked the first album, but it definately is not the place to start."
2,Not A Bad Album,I bought this album because I heard one of its songs on the radio and really liked it. I didn't expect to like any of the others but they weren't too bad.
4,Great voice and rocking music,"Tracy Bonham has a distinctive and powerful voice of the Janis Joplin kind, and she's not afraid to use it. I immediately picked her out on the background of an Aerosmith record, adding some nice punch to one of their tracks on Honkin' On Bobo.She's a great composer of rock tunes, with some confident, satirical, feminist lyrics. ""Behind Every Good Woman"" is the best cut on this album, and if your local radio station didn't play it, shame on them. I bought the CD for that song, but once it got into my CD player, it stayed there for weeks. Let's hope Tracy keeps making full-tilt rock like this album."
3,"Yes, the potential is there","A lot of the either reviews here talk about Tracy Bonham's need for a better producer, stronger songs, more focus, etc. I agree. She has great potential but some of her lyrics are heavyhanded and/or commonplace. The music is well-crafted with a lot of variety in the hooks, but the hooks are not all that original. I think Tracy has a great voice and her violin gives some interesting color to the songs where it is heard. Let's hope that her next CD will show more development."
4,First of a great tradition,"Situation was B-Side single released by Yaz(oo) in the early '80s and this mix, while weak in someways by today's standards of overdubbed club thumbing and tribal traditions, is a testament to the first generation of non-computer mixes when things were done old school with tape and signal. It is a good addition to the collection, especially for those without the Live at the BBC version which this remix was based on."
1,A Good Book,This would probably have been A Good Book if I had recieved it. I ordered this book on July 31st and still have not recieved it. My bank account was charged for it and cleared the bank on August 3rd. I have written 2 e-mails to agoodbook.md and I recieved a response to the 2nd e-mail onthe 27th of August that they were putting a trace on the order but it is now the 31st of August and I haven't heard anything else.I have ordered from Amazon.com before but never had a problem like this. Don't know if I will ever order anything else.
5,Ron Paul on the Federal Reserve,"""Even if the Fed chairman really possessed the singular genius our media and politicians regularly ascribe to him, what if things have reached a point at which the Fed simply cannot stop the collapse? What if economic law, which the Fed can no more defy than it can repeal the law of gravity, is about to hit the Fed and the American people like a tidal wave, before which little rate cuts here and there are like the tiny umbrella Wile E. Coyote puts over his head to protect himself from falling boulders?""Ron Paul quoted fromThe Revolution: A Manifesto"
4,Recomended,"This book came highly recomended by my Economics Professor. It is an easy enough read, there are plenty of places to stop if you have a short attention span like me and have to stop every half hour to take a break. I thought the content was novel and conveyed in way that makes it like a story rather than a history book. I got through the first two chapters- lots of class reading."
5,This Monster is Killing Us!,"This book is stunning! It explains a lot. I now can begin to understand the truth about that ""black hole"" we call the Federal Reserve. This private, quasi-governmental cartel really controls the world. If the general public knew the truth about all the current and past manipulations and the real debt, there would be riots in the streets! We are in real trouble, folks. Everyone should become their own Central Bank. Don't see how we can avoid a depression ... or worse. This book should be required reading for everyone."
5,Eye opening!,"If you want to know what's really going on in America, read this book. You will be amazed and frightened."
4,Good read,"The book is informative, enlightening, and contains a lot of history.A must read for all who care about the financial status of the country."
5,A Red Pill,Red pills make you wiser. A great book about money and especially fractional reserve banking. The rest is interesting and entertaining and at times thrilling and disturbing. To be truly informed it's important to look at at our world from different views and I believe this one is well worth your time.
5,A Must Read,This is the history that they never teach you in school. The author uses many references and quotes to back up his research. I wish this was required reading for all schools in the United States. Everyone should get this book and become more informed.
5,Eye Opening,"This book is about more than the Federal Reserve. It is about more than our banking system. It is about more than fiat money and inflation steeling wealth from the people. This book is about the life and death of the American Dream, how the American people lost their way. Big government has taken over, it is time for the American people to remember our, ""inalienable rights - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" - Declaration of Independence"
4,A must read for anyone who is interested in the book description,"There is not much that I can add that has not already been stated. If you are interested in the things mentioned in the book description, you must read this book. I read the book before the credit crises began last summer, and it helped me understand that a bailout was coming, and more.If you want to know more about the credit crises, I would recommend reading this book followed by ""The Trillion Dollar Meltdown"" by Charles R. Morris.The Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash"
5,page turner....,Mr. Griffin does an incredible job at making a complex subject interesting and fun to read. The Federal Reserve is truly a cabal.This book is a must read by anyone who is interested in America's untold history and the creation of money.The story unfolds much like a mystery so i felt an appropriate title to my review is 'page turner'. It was for me.
3,Researcher,"Long, detailed, sometimes hard to follow but it is the truth revealed. Take the time (line it up with what the Constitution does not agree with) and you will be rewarded"
5,The Creature From Jekyll Island,An absolutely incredible summary that combines economics and politics into a systematic attack on our freedom and prosperity. Could not put it down. Reads like a murder mystery. The victim being our independence.
5,Full discourse on the Stealing of your wealth every day by the Federal Reserve System,"I gave the book 5 stars even though the book is a little too long bc the subject matter far outweighs the execution.This book will keep you from being deceived from every trick in the book the bankers will try to steal your money. It exposes the corruption of our banking system and therefore opens your eyes to how you can protect your wealth from being stolen.If you can read this book and not feel compelled to educate people and fight the current banking system, then you're either a zombie or a banker."
1,An economics book written by a speech and communications writer,"Bottom Line: Half of the information in this book is fact, mixed in with half fiction and falsehoods. The author has a degree in speech and communications, not economics. He has some very wild ideas and states them with no justification and quotes people out of context to support his crazy theories. Some of the info is good, but this book is an example of why our electorate is becoming more polarized and less educated about how things actually work. I have an undergrad in physics and a masters in international security and economic policy and have taken many undergrad and graduate economics classes. If you have taken these classes as well you know many things the author says are completely false."
1,Dont Be Fooled !!,"This is presented as if it is the audio version of the book, IT IS NOT. Dont be fooled. This is a brief commentary regarding the highlights of the book. I feel as this was completely a misrepresentation considering the discription and all the ""top"" reviews are about the book NOT the product. The product is an hour long commentary of a 600+ page book. My purchase is on its way back ! DISAPPOINTED> LAME> FAKE"
3,Recycled,"I admit, up front, I have yet to read this book. I will borrow it from a friend. I did listen to Mr. Griffin's lecture and it is good that someone is bringing this to the fore again (hence second look). The Lost Science of Money by Stephen Zarlunga and the Secrets of the Federal Reserve by Mullins along with many others tells the same story only decades before this book. The American Monetary Institute has been fighting this problem for years. This book is a recycle of the work of many others who have been sounding the alarm longer than Mr. Griffin has been on the planet. I don't know if he acknowledges the shoulders he stands on and, if he does, kudos."
5,"Freedom, or Economic and Political Despotism?","Through interested study, over many years, I have learned bits and pieces of the actions and events that have been presented in ""The Creature from Jekyll Island"". Until now, I have never seen anyone put it all together so completely.Information is powerful, and this should shake you to your core. It demands a reaction, even if you care for nothing except your own self preservation.Life as we know it is at stake. I have watched us, as a nation, being robbed and put further into economic serfdom, ever progressing bondage, now taking on more than ever, the goal of international, global socialism, and it is now moving fast, and effecting every single one of us.Friends, we are not just talking the usual ""weather and politics"", this is the abduction of life in America as we thought we knew it.Read, and identify it's effect on you!"
4,The bottle is half empty (or half full?),"The author in this book hates both inflation (hidden tax) and unemployment (disaster for most people). As is well known, there is a trade off between inflation and unemployment, that is, you cannot keep them both low! So, when in situation of high inflation and low unemployment, the author blames the hidden tax by government, while in low inflation and high unemployment, the author blames the bankers don't care about the life of people. However, the reader can always reverse the argument to praise the government and bankers.Apparently, the author is a hard-core bullionist and there has been a debate long ago back to 1800.Anyway, it is an interesting fiction!"
5,A FRIGHTENING PROSPECT,"THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT THE HOUSE OF CARDS UPON WHICH THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS BASED , THE MORE UPSET I GET. THE BOOK IS MARVELOUS, EASY TO READ AND BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN."
5,A true-life conspiracy story,"Griffin say that the Federal Reserve System is a giant conspiracy created to inflate the money supply in order to make the bankers rich, keep the politicans supplied with enough cash to get reelected, lower the American standard of living, and buy off foreign dicators. Then when everything gets real bad, the internationalists at the top will step in and ""fix things"" by imposing a world-wide socialist regime. The most disturbing thing is that it all seems true. Marx had it wrong--inflation, not private property, is theft."
4,Knowledge Can Be Unnerving,"I work for a large financial institution. A very important client recommended the book to me after a lengthy discussion on current events. I was immediately taken by her physically which was initially why I read the book, as conversation fodder if we ever ran across each other again. I now wish I hadn't, it's THAT kind of book. The type that leaves you feeling as if your place in the world has been called into question. JZM"
4,Look at the Fed.,This is a good book for people interested in a behind the scenes look at the Federal Reserve Bank. Evocative information that raises additional questions.
2,ALL THESE SONGS ARE ON OTHER SINGLES,"If you're a real Beck collector, then you already have these b-sides tracks. If not, then get this knowing that there's other b-sides out there floating around.Plus 30 bucks for 8 tracks is wack."
3,"I hate to nag, but can't let this one go","Dear msrocks,I just wanted to point out to you that one does not release an album with a track ""sung in Mexican.""But I must say that the mariachi version of ""Jackass"" is remarkable. Great album, but unless you have oodles of disposable income or are a Beck-o-phile that has to own the factory release of every experiment or song he has recorded, buy yourself a nice meal instead and get a generous Beck fan-club chat-room member to burn you a copy of these songs for the price of a CD-R and the shipping cost."
5,A miraculous story,"This is a simply beautiful story. It is told with honesty and compassion. It is rare that I find such a meaningful tale amid all the commercialism of this season. I want to thank the author and illustrator for sharing their words, pictures and hearts. The world is a kinder, richer, more enlightened place because of them. One caveat: because of the reference to the Holocaust and the tie man losing his entire family, I would not recommend reading this to any child younger than seven. But all in all, just a thoughtful, moving classic-in-the-making."
4,suspenful foreplay,"Sano is a detective who is torn between a world, which is attempting to maintain its identity and at the same time deal with modernity. Sano's character embodies the conflicts between these two worlds, however, his true master is the quest for the truth. Similar to the Shinju, Rowland's earlier book, Sano has to overcome overwhelming odds in order to solve a murder however this time finds himself uncovering governmental corruption. Rowland has mastered the art of historical accuracy and suspenseful foreplay."
4,Filthy Gaijin!,"The third in the Japanese historical series, this one takes Sano Ichiro from Edo to Nagasaki on an inspection. It's 1690 and Nagasaki is the one place where barbarian traders (the Dutch East India Co.) are permitted to come and trade. Sano is quickly embroiled in investigating the death of the head of the Dutch trade mission, which spins off into smuggling and possibly an illegal Christian underground. As usually, there is a lot of interesting history and social custom imparted in the course of the whodunit, which is good, 'cause Sano's inner conflict and the actual mystery aren't all that compelling in and of themselves."
2,"Sheer melodrama, lacks power of others in series","I was very impressed by Rowland's work after reading The Concubine's Tattoo. I felt she had a real knack for drawing complex characters with believable motivations. I was completely drawn into the world she portrays, and I found Sano an interesting character with some very believable problems. My one criticism of the novel was its melodramatic ending. Then I read Shinju and had much the same reaction.But The Way of the Traitor is melodrama through and through, unredeemed by any of the depth of feeling that marks the others. The author's attempts to flesh out her characters by the use of flashbacks to their earlier lives fails badly, and the plot is like something out of Enid Blyton, with mysterious lights and smuggler's coves. By the time I got to the last couple of chapters I no longer cared about any of it, least of all who the guilty parties were."
4,A Pretty Good Shogun-esq Mystery Series,"These series of novels are all pretty good. I have read three of the books all on the airplane. The mystery is usually pretty good and the time period and characters are great. If you like Feudal Japanese history, these books are for you. Again, not the greatest but certainly enjoyable"
2,Needs more oomph.,"This was a letdown after the entertaining Bundori. The meeting of east and west, however, was an intriguing glimpse of how foreigners were treated and thought to be like. I also found the ending rather dull. If you want to buy a copy, get it in paperback. I bought the hardcover and really regretted it."
2,Wrote a song regarding the author's obession with what is,"not really there. Anyone care to copy feel free.""I got vision and the rest of the world wears bifocals."" Butch Cassidy and the Sundance KidI see the light shining in each of us I see a world waiting to learn, yeah There's a force that's forcing our surrender If we don't start acting like human beingsDon't you know what I'm talking aboutI see a place that isn't very far from here Time is the greatest distance between us There's a love that's hoping to love us Providing we can love ourselvesDon't you know what I'm talking aboutThe world won't end in an instant There's a light, a light that's bright There's a pain deep inside my deepest being There's a heaven found inside my darkest hellDon't you know what I'm talking about These chemtrails are killing, all you love You can't see the sky, only lies...Oh yeah.Oh yeahhhhhhhhhhhhDon't buy the book."
3,Dark,"Wow! This is one of the darkest, most violent films seen to date. The story was nothing new: Father goes after the killers of his daughter, who happens to be a junkie and gang raped for a snuff film. It shows things I prefer left to the imagination. He becomes a killing machine (evidently if a child dies, you just become a bad a@@), who picks up a girl(who, coincidently happens to be a junkie). Although, nothing happens in the film; the implications makes your skin crawl. I am quite certain they were going for the martyr savior thang; but, it had the opposite effect. It reminded me a little of The Professional, with a body count that is all face to face. I reccomend The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo; still dark, but with a plot that seems plausible. It also does not make you want to take a shower afterwards. The Horseman is a very dark film."
2,Dissapointing and over-hyped,"I bought this film excited on a friend's recommendation and the review on here, as I am always game for a good revenge film. This movie in my opinion fails in not making me sympathetic to the protagonist dad. He wasn't a true badass expect when he turned into killing mode, but other aspects he was just whining too much. I left the film not carrying if he got his revenge and at times wishing someone would just end him. Which isn't good, aren't I suppose to be rooting for him?"
1,Blu-Ray Review,This is not Blu-Ray Quality at all. It is terrible. The worse Blu-Ray I have ever seen out of about 300 that I own.
2,Tiny Tiny Tiny,"I bought this item for my wife, I just recieved it now and with great anticipation opened the box only to be shocked by its tiny size. the picture posted by amazon is really really REALLY enlarged. this thing is no bigger then a pair of rice grain stuck together. dissapointed."
3,Teeny Tiny Pearl,"I didn't expect this pearl necklace to be huge, but the size of the pearl is absolutely miniscule. But, for the size, it is a delicate little necklace that you can wear every day. As I was dissappointed with the pearl's size (the picture on Amazon is blown up 100000x), I would recommend it to a pre-teen or teenager."
4,A Gift Supreme for High School English Teachers,"Almost since Beowulf was written (or hewn), High School Senior English(of which British Literature is the general fare)has begun (the most sensitive part of the school year - the beginning, yes) with what is for the average high school senior (not generally an afficiado of olde English) a long, draggy, boring reading assignment - which today, even with the resonant Seamus Heany translation - I'd wager the vast majority students don't bother reading past page 6. Now we have a modern, action-packed, loud, gory, albeit, somewhat inaccurate - film rendering - I say let it spin, mates. Salvation has arrived!!!"
4,Beowulf,"I've seen a few renditions of Beowulf, but didn't want to purchase one that wasn't fairly close to the original writing. Most of them are too sensationlized, but this was very nearly what I was looking for."
4,An interesting look,"this movie was by no means perfect but I found it highly enjoyable. I think it was well cast and it was a unique take on this classic tale. As the title indicates, Grendel is more central in this version. He is more than a one dimesional monster. He is a chracter with thoughts, and feelings, and motivations for his actions. I like this idea. I also particualary enjoyed some of the religiouse commentary that was added. I thought it was a great way to adress the fact that while Beowulf is has a Heathen Norse setting, the text that we have was obviously written down by a Christian (or possibly several), who put his religious slant on all the characters and events.I'd recommend this for fans of the the story and also for Heathen looking for a good show with a few laughs."
3,"Nice Beefcake, Weird Accents","I thought this was a pretty good telling of the Beowulf story, but it's not a story I care much for, anyway. Both Grendel the troll and Gerard Butler as Beowulf display sufficient beef to satisfy viewers who are interested in that sort of thing, as I am.I really liked Sarah Polley's film ""Away From Her"", but I wasn't familiar with her as an actress, so I was eager to see her in this. I had a hard time enjoying her performance,though, just because her accent (I thought it sounded Midwest, but I guess it's Canadian) seemed so incredibly out of place in the story. Couple that with Butler's hard Scots accent and Grendel's unintellible grunting and braying, and you have a really incoherent linguistic hodge-podge. I kept waiting for a Dane from Brooklyn to chime in, but alas, it didn't happen."
2,Beowulf and Grendel,"After waiting over 30 years for a movie to be made of one of my favorite stories, I was sorely disapppointed in this production. There was barely anything in the movie which was true to the original epic poem. The best part of the movie was the scenery and the costumes. My least favorite part was Grendel conceiving a child with a witch. This epic poem has been read by generations of English-speaking people, not because it is easy to read but because it is a great story."
1,Straight to DVD....no wonder.,"Maybe you'll find a gem every now and then that went straight from the cutting room floor to DVD, but this is not it. This movie is the direct result of what happens when there is absolutely no production and no money put into a film. While the scenery and landscapes may be fascinating, the acting and dialogue is horrible. I'm sorry, I've read the poem and have seen these actors in other roles and this movie is a completely distorted view of what the poem really is and who the actors really are. Save your money and your time and wait for Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf adaptation coming out later this year in a THEATER near you."
1,Another ruined classic,"Don't be fooled by the costumes and scenery. This film mutilates the greatness of the Beowulf story. The monster is regarded as a victim, the Geat warriors a bunch of immoral thugs, and Hrothgar more evil than Grendel. Adding insult to injury, the acting is second-rate, the scenes are joined like a broken window, and script is full of anachronism.Disappointing, moldy cheese on an attractive platter.Don't waste your money."
5,Butler fan with bias attitude,"Yes, I am an avid Gerry Butler fan but I can still think for myself! I have the movie on DVD as well as all of Gerry's movies. This doesn't mean that I'm in love with all of them. As far as B&G I gave this film a four star rating because of the breathtaking vistas and the comedy. Yes, I said comedy. I don't know if it was meant to be, but I found some parts very Monty Pythonish. I also found some parts quite sad as far as the Troll. He was actually misunderstood because he was different. This is supposed to be what the story is all about. I wasn't happy with the dialog only because and I confess, I couldn't understand most of the accents. I had no problem with Gerry's accent as I'm used to it. He's a Scot what do you expect! All in all I would watch this movie again because I was entertained and isn't that what it's all about?"
5,Great Movie not a substitute for reading the book though.,"Very well done beautiful scenery, good cast though it dose not follow the story it is still a grest movie."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I had a hard time getting thru this movie. Why on earth was all the bad language put in there. It was just so out of place to see men of this period of time using the ""F"" word, and more, over and over again. It just didn't fit. The acting wasnt bad, just the scripts. It could have been a good movie done properly. My impression was Poor Low Budget Film! Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Hopefully I can resell it."
1,Don't waste your time,"This was the most obnoxious time waster I have ever witnessed. I kept waiting for the Monty Python Troup to show up. The acting was horrid. What was with the rocks and urinating on the door?? I found myself rooting for Grendel. Of the 33 people in the theater, 10 got up and left half way through. This was a story of great heros, not neurotic children. Too bad Gerard Butler's career has come to this. I hope the Beowulf saga ends here and no attempt is made to do a sequel as discussed in the director interview. I would have been ashamed to put my name on this piece of work."
1,Incredibly bad film--avoid at all costs!!,"Save you money and rent or buy The Thirteenth Warrior instead, a Beowulf adaptation that is a cinematic masterpiece by comparison to this drek. If you want to see Gerard Butler ina medieval film, then rent Timeline, also a masterpiece by comparison. The highly repetitive soundtrack, stationary camera work, constant use of the same lng and medium shots (where are the close ups?), and snail's pace editing make this low budget Beowulf & Grendel unwatchable. Shots of Bowulf and his gang riding shetland poneys are truly laughable, as are the fake blood and severed limbs and heads and he bearded boy at the start of the film. The glowing reviews on this website are no doubt written by relatives of the cast and crew or by employees in the marketing firm paid to plug this sorry excuse for a film."
1,BEOWULF & GRENDEL,"WHAT CAN I SAY ,I KNOW THE STORY AND IF I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE I KNEW THE STORY, I WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THE STORY AT ALL. STRICTLY HOLLYWOOD CRAPE, NOTHING TOO WRITE HOME ABOUT. I WAS SORELY DISSAPPOINTED. I GAVE MY COPY TO MY HALF SISTER, NEVER LIKED HER MUCH ANYWAY.."
3,yummy.........gerry butler,"this movie is must have for all gerry butler fans,oh yea the movie is not to bad either............"
5,Beowulf and Grendl,Great production of an epic poem!! Superb cast of performers gave all they had!! Have watched many times now and am spellbound till the end!! Truly a great movie that is sure to be a classic! Spectacular scenery and a great director and crew with Gerard Butler as Beowulf makes this movie a must-have!! I just can't say enough about Mr. Butler..he is an awesome character actor!!! 5++ stars from us!!Dvd had no subtitles for us older viewers.
4,Lost a Star,"Though this is a beautifully shot film, it isn't a perfect picture. Based on the classic tale/myth, the movie does a good job filling in the blanks from the ancient verse in which it is derived. The problem I have with the movie is that I felt more compassion for the troll(hairy muscle man) than I did for the hero. The movie tries to be a drama and an action movie and doesn't quite hit the full mark for either. Lastly, the accent are all over the board. I recognized Scottish, Australian, Canadian, possibly British and American. Not to be negative, the scenery is gorgeous, the actors are good, the costumes are great, and the story is a classic. Worth seeing, but I would rent it before you decide to buy."
2,Beowoeful,"I was hoping this film would be good, but alas - twas not to be. Let's face it people, it's a pretty bad movie.Clumsily edited, terrible makeup (especially all the rubber Grendel body-suits), no closeups of actors (there are about 10 actors in the whole ""epic"" movie), and that's not even mentioning the accents, which are all over the map. Sarah Polley sounds like she's straight out of the mall, while Butler is unintelligable half the time.The scenery is gorgeous, but it's hard to get into the spirit of a Beowulf movie that is twice as inept as The 13th Warrior. If you are on the fence, take a pass."
2,Not so good...,After enjoying so much action and effects on the new animation film with Hopkins and Angelina..this one falls short of almost everything...good acting but a lack of depth and budget make this one a rental at the most.
3,Beowulf & Grendal,"This was a decent watch, I am a complete fan of 300 and G. Butler. However, this film does not have all of the effects that 300 has. The story is as cool as the animated version of Beowulf, it's a poem after all, and the scenery is breathtaking. Moreover, there are parts in this movie that will make you laugh, I thought the miniature horses they rode throughout were hilarious. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it for true movie watchers."
4,Better the second time!,"Strange that the description of the dvd does not mention Gerard Butler, who is the star! I had also seen the other version of Beowulf, that is part animation, and thought it was wonderful, and since I love Gerard I wanted to see this one. I was disappointed. Then, I bought Wrath of gods, the story of the filming of Beowulf and Grendel. I watched Gerard's hour long interview talking about the back story of Beowulf and Grendel, and then it made more sense, and I understood it when I watched it again! Recommended, especially if you have a chance to see Gerard talk about his interest in the movie, and Beowulf, and the story of Beowulf, which is more familiar in Europe than it is in the US."
1,Terrible movie--stay away,"This is a horrible movie. Anyone looking for something similar to Lord of the Rings or any other well-done movie based on an epic tale, should look elsewhere. Terrible script, bad sets, horrible acting. I could watch/listen when Selma the witch with the American accent was on screen. Her acting is some of the worst I've seen in recent times. How does she get work? And the script writer went out of his way to make the dialogue sound epic or ""old"" and it sounded ridiculous with her American accent. Not to mention all the gratuituous swearing. Swearing's fine (I do a lot of it myself) but when it's just crammed in there for no reason it's sound moronic. Bad movie. Laughable makeup jobs (check out Grendel's hair and muscle suit)."
1,"For Gerard, pick another movie","Even the eye candy of Gerard Butler cannot save this miserable mess of a movie. The action scenes are ridiculous, the dialog silly, and the pace boringly slow. I actually fell asleep during it, which is a first for me, being a HUGE Gerard Butler fan. Gerard himself even seems fed up with the movie in the interview included in the DVD. If you love Gerard, better to pick one of his other films rather than waste your time and money on this one. This gets one star, only because Gerard is in it."
2,BLAH,NOT A VERY GOOD MOVIE...GREAT IMAGES AND SOUND WAS OK BUT THE DIALOGUE COULD OF BEEN BETTER THOUGHT OUT..IN MY OPINION
2,Not enough action and too much bad dialog,"Grendel and Beowulf is yet another retelling of the epic 6th century poem Beowulf, but is not a good one. The film looks great, filmed in Iceland you can really believe you're in Denmark or Sweden fifteen centuries ago. The clothing, armor and swords are well done as well. But for telling an exciting story, this movie is pretty dull. There's a lot of talking and standing around, but not much action. Other problems include sporadic dialog that is too modern and out of place, and the actors accents. The hero, Beowulf, who is from Sweden, is played nicely by Gerard Butler but he makes no attempt to hide his Scottish accent. Sarah Polley plays a Danish witch with a flat American accent. Everytime they spoke I found it jarring as it just didn't fit. The character of the witch and a few other elements are add-ons to the original material and aren't needed and don't really work. This is a nice looking film, but not a good one."
2,OMG is this bad...,"This was a very poorly done movie. Very boring for such a ""heoric"" tale. The only reason it didn't give it 1 star is that it has guys with swords and a hot red-head. That's really the best the B&G; has to offer. Spare yourself the agony and save your money.So NOT recommended."
5,Seen it 3 times!,"I've traveled to Canada twice to see this movie 3 times and look forward to the DVD, in order to allow friends to be able to see it also..since a US release of the movie doesn't seem to be happening. It definitely is a movie that offers more with each viewing..a multi layered tale that has one looking things up to learn more about the poem and the period of history/mythology where the action takes place."
3,Interesting movie,"Watch Beowulf and Grendel for the scenery and Gerard Bulter, as his acting and good looks are never hard to bear. However, do not watch this looking for a faithful adaptation of Beowulf, the epic poem. With the additions of new characters (Selma) and new motives for Grendel, this movie fails to provide anywhere near the themes and spirit of the original poem. I think the quality of the script was overshadowed by the real main character - Iceland."
3,Kind Of A Yawner,"As a fan of Beowulf I really wanted to love this film. Turns out it was okay, and thats about it. Slow in spots, and it did not really follow the book all that much. I think ""13th Warrior"" did a better job than this newer film as being closer to the original story."
4,Not the CGI one!,"Movie was pretty good. However, I thought this was the new one that was computer generated. It's not! As such, it may be on BluRay, but it's really not much better than an upconverted regular DVD."
4,Beowulf & Grendel- Gerard Butler,"I have seen other versions of this story and this is the best by far. I am a huge Gerry Butler fan, but this is a story that was told with such ternderness compared to other versions and the scenery is breathtaking. Not at all gorey or gross which is amazing for this story."
4,For the want of a good woman...,"A witty script, wonderful costumes, unbelievable scenery - this should have been a very enjoyable period film, especially since Gerard Butler is on the screen for the majority of the time. But once Sarah Polley opens her mouth, the film goes flat. I cannot believe she was the best of what was available for the role. I am thankful that her involvement is minimal."
2,What a way to ruin a classic.,"I had high hopes for this movie. I'm a major fan of this genre, and was hoping I'd found another clasic. After all, the movie was based on a epic. How could they go wrong? The way they went wrong was to add modern speech to the film's dialogue. Everytime I became immersed in the realistic look of the movie, a contemporary phrase or profanity would snap me out of the film. It happened time and time again. It became comical. After about an hour, I ejected the Beowulf and Grendel DVD from the player, put it back in the case, and returned it to the rental store. I haven't any desire to see the rest."
1,A lousy movie,"Why anyone bothers to make a movie this bad is a mystery. ""The Thirteenth Warrior"" remains the best Beowulf movie to date, in my opinion. This one stinks. Save your money and time."
2,Rent it instead of buying it,"I'm not going to lie, when I say that this movie had so much more potential. Gerard Butler is an excellent actor, but the script for this movie was weak. Therefore, he did not perform to his full potential. If you read the story in school about Beowulf, the movie will let you down. I just wish Hollywood could understand this when they make big budget movies. The actor Gerard Butler is just now being recognized for his work in 300. I noticed his potential in Dracula 2000. He pours himself into the characters he portrays. I just think it was sad for him to waste his time in Beowulf."
3,Nice Film but slow moving,"Overall a pretty decent film with Gerard Butler completely suited for the role. The person who seemed out of place was Sarah Polley, somewhat inauthentic as the witch Selma. Scenery while harsh and drab is still quite beautiful, and the actor who plays the troll, I thought, did the best acting.Don't expect high octane action. This is meant to have followed along the tones of the Old English poem set in Scandanavia. Pleasant to watch but a little slow going."
1,Well Done But Poorly Conceived,"The movie was well done- the acting and presentation was pretty good. However it managed to completely miss the point of the book. Since when was a man-eating monster just mistreated and misunderstood? Though Grendel was portrayed as a victim, bothe his and his mother's hovels were strewn with piles of bones! Despite his diet of people the king cannot think of a reason that he should have dispatched Grendel's father beyond the coincidence of their paths crossing. Such enormous liberties were taken with the story- to present the hero as the bad guy and the monster as the tragic hero! What a shame to take such a wonderfully crafted work and twist it to show ""what it really must have been like."" The whole point of fiction is to see things beyond our scope. To edit and reduce this marvelous tale in order to make it match someone's idea of what must have been--that is truly tragic."
2,BORING,I watched 2007's Beowulf and it was absolutely amazing so I rented this version. What a horrible movie! Beowulf was some guy with a bunch of hair on him and a kid could have stopped him! The whole movie was just people sitting around and talking! Horrible!
5,Good story well done,This is real intense and well produce rendition of a classic tale. Not for the prude. It tells it like it was without too much literary license. May be too intense for young audiences.
3,Beowulf&Grendel,"Its not too bad. The creature effects on Grendel could've been a little tighter; and the longhouses could've been more authentic. In my opinion, there wasn't enough musical score. I'm not usually a fan of ""a lot"" of music in a movie, but hero-introductions, suspence-building moments, obligatory love scenes, and struggles need it.On the lighter side, the cast carried the movie well. It wasn't the type of B-movie that was filled with missed cues and bad delivery. Some of the views were beautiful. It also took a different route with Grendel and Grendel's Mother than I had not imagined from the original tale. Also, the movie showed Hrothgar in a whole different light."
1,Beowulf and Grendel - the worst,"Beowulf and Grendel has to be the worst interpretation of the epic poem ever to be filmed. If the viewer is looking for a pictorial representation of the original, this mess isn't it. It is loaded with gratuitous sex and violence, has characters that don't exist in the poem, has language that doesn't exist in either the original Old English or any translation. The action is made up of wildly improbable and illogical events. Beowulf with a Scottish accent is laughable. Beowulf's original home is at the southern end of Sweden. The correct pronunciation of Geat is Gay-ot. Save your money and your eyesight."
3,good story changed,"This is a story that has been told for centuries around smoky fires, written down early, and treasured by multiple cultures. So why does a screenwriter feel like he can change Grendel to a vengeful, misunderstood human? It makes the action scenes laughable that these strong, well equipped warriors cannot kill a barehanded human. And instead of a mighty clawed limb nailed to the hall pillar, there is just the pale arm of a mister universe runnerup. Generations of storytellers have wisdom that should not be overturned by some hack. All the beautiful scenery, all the fine acting, all the atmosphere are spoiled by a monster who is not."
4,Heroic effort,"I think that this is the better of the two renderings of the Beowulf movies that lately have been viewable. The seem to have done their homework. The costuming and the set seem to be accurate to my knowledge. Beowulf is a difficult work to turn into a movie to begin with and this is the most heroic effort I've seen. Gerard Butler was great as the heroe, although the the Scotish accent didn't seem quite right. The original was in Anglo-saxon and therefore they should have been more Germanic sounding. Likewise the setting was too rocky for Denmark, at least I don't think that the Jutland Peninsula is quite that rugged. Overall I enjoyed it, and recommend it to others to see."
1,One is too much,"Being bored and offended at the same time is hard to manage - but this film manages. It is lacking in story lines and acting and I would advise anyone not to waste money buying it. If you want to wait and rent it, then you will have invested less. Just make sure to get another film to watch after you get bored and quit with this one."
2,Liberal Dreck,Parts of the movie were fine. The Scenery was great and even the low tech monsters worked. The acting was fair to good. I could even get by the mixture of accents and contemporary slang.What killed the movie for me was the ridiculous and misplaced modern liberal hand wringing by the Polley character. The modern sentiments seemed completely out of place in 6th century Nordic Culture. A shame.
1,A waste of trees,"What a dissapointment - this book is just a collection of the Linux Documentation Project's ""how-to's."" Back that up with a horrible index (a measly 7 page-index covers 2000 pages of text), and these guys get an F for effort. The installation-guide wasn't any help for me because I bought a specific guide for that. What I needed was a comprehensive and well indexed reference."
3,"Beautiful, but ill-fitting","Seduced by its handsome exterior, uniqueness and seemingly eco-friendly statement, I bought the Tread laptop sleeve, only to be disappointed to discover it didn't fit my 15.4 macbook pro. Advertised for mac and pc, I didn't think there would be a problem. It slid lithely into the case, but when I tried to zip it up, one corner poked out and the zipper couldn't get around it. A real shame, because I was already growing attached to its rugged industrial looking exterior. The seller took it back readily. I wish it had fit! I'm not sure if I got a defective one or that a change in laptop size caused the lack of a good fit."
2,Academic but partial analysis of Lebanon,"This book by Professor Farid Khazen is a good read and is well-researched. However, it is an attempt to articulate in academic mantle the Right Wing view in the Lebanon War that the Palestinians were largely responsible for the decay of the Lebanese state, supported by radical Arab states and the Soviet Union. Prof Khazen moves then to a meticulous refutation of Lefitst views of the war, denying that sectarian divisions led to the war or that there were legitimate social and economic grievances among the Lebanese (as the leftists were syaing). Despite the length of Prof Khazen's book, I don't find it satisfying as an account of what happened in Lebanon in the period 1967-1976, nor does it cover adequatley the destructive role played by the Lebanese elites in these tragic years."
3,A good reference book,"A good reference book -- but only if you really need the details, otherwise this is deffinitely a biased account of the war. The problem is not in what Mr. El Khazen says, but in what he leaves out. If this is your first book about the Lebanese war, then you are much better off with any of Kamal Salibi's books on Lebanon."
5,Original and scholarly work,"This well researched, scholarly book on Lebanese politics and society is a welcome contribution to the study of conflict in the Middle East. The subject matter Farid el Khazen deals with is no doubt complex and controversial. But the author presents his arguments in a balanced and convincing way. His novel approach - examining Lebanon in crisis situations in broader regional perspective - is original and lucid. For anyone seeking to know the internal and external causes of the war in Lebanon, this is the book to read."
5,"Warm, insightful","Written in the pages of this book are the questions and challenges one may face when placing a child in safe environment whether that be school, church, childcare, etc. Do you pick a public or a private school? Do you label a child? How do you find a good doctor? What about testing? I found that the advice that Dian Drake Burns offers is, after years of her own personal experience, excellent. This book as well as others such as, ""Preparing for Life"", are awesome resources"
2,A watered down pamphlet.,"I read this entire book in an hour. It is double-spaced with large type. It is mostly common-sense fluff. It does offer a decent pep talk and a few suggestions. It could have been put out as a booklet.It is subtitled ""A parent's guide..."" but was clearly directed toward mothers, which I found a bit offensive."
4,Very helpfull,Very helpfull w/ assisting to understand the likenesses of all. These 'disorders' are very similar and very difficult to understand when all symptoms are so similar. Helpful with diagnosing/behavioral modification techniques & what might work & what won't work.
5,"At last, something that really works!","This is a great, must have companion to The Easy Way To Stop Smoking. It's small, hits the high points of the book, and gets to the point of reminding you of why you stopped in the first place. It also reinforces the new way of thinking about smoking, and you can review it in an hour or less. It really helped me to my continued success to be free from smokers hell forever. I've tried it all in the past. I was a chain smoker and had given up on the idea that I could ever quit. This actually worked...and it really was easy! You owe it to yourself to try it. For a very small price, you can gain what is priceless like I did."
3,It's ok,"I would recomend ""The Easy Way to Quit Smoking"" instead, which is just a full version of this little book."
4,loved it!,"I read this book a year ago and haven't smoked since.I had tried many other times and was not successful, I bought these copies for friends I care about hoping they have the success I did."
2,Not what I expected,"As a supplement to Alan Carr's oringinal easyway book, the little book of quitting is cool. But alone, this book is not really all that motivational. I read the Easyway and this book twice, and I'm still smoking like a chimney. Don't waste your money, just go buy some patches."
1,Don't Bother,"If you don't already believe the fundamentals of this book you aren't ready to quit. The continuous ""I AM A NONSMOKER"" was annoying. Although admittedly, I'm not a big fan of the Cheerleader type self help books. I still can't fathom how this book ever got 5 stars based on quality and price. If you're committed to quiting talk to your doctor and join a group or try replacement therapy and skip this money waster."
3,A great switch with only one drawback.,"I've put this switch in service a couple of weeks ago and I'm quite pleased with all the electrical aspects. The WebView works just as I expected with no problems so far. Now for the drawback, get out your earplugs. Unfortunately this winning little box will drive you nuts if you have to be in the same room for more than a few minuets. Evan with the door closed it's difficult to concentrate in the next room for very long. If your situation doesn't call for working on site, or any where near it, it's a great switch."
2,AVOID THIS SWITCH,"I have 13 of these that I'm responsible for. They are, at best, functional, and at worst extremely problematic. I have had webview interface issues with about half of them, at least 2 of the 13 have GBIC issues. And several of them need to be restarted at least once every 6 weeks to keep them operating at peak efficiency.On the plus side, they're fast, they're cheap and they're POE seems to work quite well. They are relatively easy to use. But the problems I've had with them are so frustrating, I'll NEVER buy another Cisco small business switch again."
3,"You need endurance, but it is worth it.","This book is written by a man of his time. It has few embellishments and could be described as being written in an understatement. Do not look for character developments or a sense of the privations and living conditions during this period.Two other books (to my knowledge) were written by Shackelton's companions and I would commend both to a reader. Worsley's book is a more readable account of this journey; while ""Shackelton's Argonauts"" (by the photographer Frank Hurley) covers similar ground and includes an account of those who stayed on Elephant Isle."
1,South without pictures,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. I had ordered the hard cover edition at a premium price expecting to get a quality reproduction of Sir Ernest Shackleton's classic book. The original book published by Heineman had many plates of photos taken by the photographer who travelled on the voyage. This version published by North Books had no photos, was on cheap paper and had a fairly basic hard cover. I sent it back and managed to source a second hand copy of the version published by Heineman."
4,A classic tale of seamanship and leadership,An unbelievable tale of the fate of twenty eight men on their journey to Antartica. The only problem with the book is that the illustrations are not coincident with the story line.
4,This is a great book that cries out for a map.,"Shackleton's memoir is a treasure - an on-the-spot account of a great adventure. However, the book, for reasons that I cannot explain, lacks a map. From nearly the first page on, the text discusses the journey by presenting direction and distance from key points in the antarctic. Why would the publisher not put in a simple map so the reader does not have to go to another source while reading the book. I suppose one could just read the book as an adventure story and not mind where it is in the world, but why, when a map would add much more to the fun and interest. Since Shackleton refers to the race to the pole, the map could also show Scott's and Amundson's routes. It would not really have taken a great effort to provide it,I would think."
2,Amazing voyage but completely boring,I found it very difficult to continue on in this book after the first couple of pages. The story had little character development and had way too many boring details. I found that I was reading about latitude and longitude markings along with ice drifts over and over within the first 30 pages. Pass on this book if you like story development instead of journalistic details.
2,Fantastic tale that is poorly written,"I was very eager to read this book because of the wonderful survival story, but from the beginning pages I was hopelessly lost in the tedius, and often boring details of this journal-like writing. * too much detail of latitude and longitude - without a map you have no idea what's going on * too many ""technical' terms used - the author assumes the reader knows all about boats, the sea, etc. * dates were given, but sometimes they were not chronological - what's happening when? * poor character development It's obvious Shackleton is not a writer, and too bad, because his story is really intriguing."
1,"Could have been great, but falls flat.","I really hate to give this book such a low rating, because it could have been so good. I agree with others, however, who described it as ""super boring"" and complain about endless pages describing latitude and longitude positions (like we care!) or the thousands of words devoted entirely to recording the subtle changes in wind direction, air temperature, movement of the ice floe, etc... I would much rather have known what these sailors were thinking and feeling. We get almost none of that. No character development. I couldn't tell one sailor from another, except that their names were different. The basic account of the voyage is interesting, but too bad only one word in fifty was necessary to tell the tale. This is the kind of book that can cure insommnia. May be valuable to historians, but not to anyone just looking for an engaging story. If you want to read a really great account of adventure at sea, try Hyderdahl's Kon-Tiki!"
4,A Boston Poet Captures Struggles of Love & Life,"I found myself humming ""Do You Still Dream of Pennsylvania?"" for a week after listening to this premier release from The Blue Tree Project. Inspirational, thought-provoking lyrics are sprinkled throughout the CD and rank as one of its strong points due to Lawson Hancock's passion for poetry and the written word.The songs have a heavily acoustic sound with several hinting to a hard rock, metallic influence. The drawback of many first releases is that most of the songs sound alike, but that thankfully wasn't the case with ""After The Fall."" I found a tantalizing variety that makes this CD very well-rounded.The artwork and photography on the CD cover and insert are exceptional--something that rarely catches my eye but that can't be missed on this CD. The lyrics, the vocal quality, and the overall package made this CD worth a listen and a look."
5,A chillout CD at its best,"If there was ever a CD you'd want to listen to after getting home CD1 is the mainly pop stuff (Lene Marlin, Tom Jones)and some other stuff thrown in including Chicane , a calming percussion mix of Moloko's 'Time Is Now , the Xtended mix of Sash & Tina Cousins 'Just Around The Hill' and three great tracks from Yomanda , one of which is a remix of Kevin & Perry 'Big Girl and another of Geri's 'Bag It Up'.Then there is a more powerful CD2 with some garage at the beginning slowly moving into dance (Spiller and Tin Tin Out) and then trance (DuMonde , Rhythm Of Life and Lange) and then a slow and cooling Marc Et Claude remix. Put your feel up and have a listen !!"
5,Satisfied Customer!!,"This was a great transaction. My book came in great time!! I would buy anything from this seller because not only did it come in time, it was inexpensive and it was in great condition!!"
3,Rescue Me needs some rescuin'!,"It's not bad, it's just not great. The vocals (especially the chorus) are fierce, but the whole song just seems to melt into itself and you can't really get into it. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like Madonna and Shep were trying to make Vogue Part 2. Weell, no such luck, but at least the houseboat vocal improves the track. Not a must for the casual fan, but definitely for the hardcore fan. If you want some really great Madonna dance music, look up Vogue, Erotica, Deeper And Deeper or Fever!"
3,This Song Is Good BUT. . .,". . .it rip offs from Dee-Lite's song ""Power of Love"" that came out in 1991. Listen to ""Power of Love"" and ""Rescue Me"" and you'll notice similarities. ""Rescue Me"" is on the Immaculate Collection and I did not see any reference to Deee-Lite in the liners."
3,A Disapointment for an Incrediable Song,"The song Resuce me, is by far, one of Madonna's Best Songs EVER.But this single could have been better, Much better! The song is so powerful and full of energy, but these remixes are weak and and degrading to orginal, not to mention they all sound simmilar, except for the S.O.S. Remix (The only remix, I really like). I only recomend this song to the Die-Hard Madonna fan. Go for the Immaculate Collection, it has the longer Studio Version of Resuce me."
3,it was ok...,"This product is so-so. I can play numerous instruments so I purchased this to help improve my piano playing abilities. If you were to come in from a beginner's point of view, it may not be the best reference to use."
4,Teach Yourself to Play Piano (Book),"I haven't gotten very far into the book, so I can't write a proper review on it. From what I have seen, it looks like it would be pretty easy to learn the content. I need to practice more and I think that will help to understand the book better. Right now, it is kind of confusing to me, but I hope it gets better. I would reccomend this book to the beginner who is trying to learn to play. It would probably be better with the CD, which I did not purchase. I do think that you need a little knowledge of the music notes, so it can be applied better in the book..."
1,Do not buy this book if you intend to teach yourself and is an absolute beginner!,"The pace of this book is VERY fast and it overwhelm me, and it doesn't go into detail about new music concept. For example, it said ""Legato : play smoothly""P.s get this book instead http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/088284931X/ref=oss_product"
4,Great All Around Product,"Got this product for my daughters who like the piano/keyboard but are inexperienced. Product arrived as stated without hassle or delay,which is 2 1/2 stars already. We opened the product and established some ground rules like; Following the recommended instructions, committing to at least 1 hour a day and 5 days a week for the first 3 weeks. In 1 1/2 weeks they were playing the one handed songs perfectly and progressed from there. Now they both can play a few songs (2 handed) and have even began to experiment with creating their own songs, they are still on the schedule but needless to say they play a lot longer than the agreed time and love it. The instructions are clear and easy to understand, and if you follow along with the DVD and do not skip lessons you will have no problem learning to play"
4,Easy for beginner,"This book is not difficult to follow, even for a true beginner. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it isn't spiral bound and the pages always fall over while I'm playing."
5,really as the book title,It is easy to follow for beginer like me. I'm so enthusiast to continue the lessons everyday. It makes me enjoy practicing the piano.
5,Good beginner's book,"This book provides a good starter to piano playing, I have ordered another one for my colleague who is learning with me."
4,Playing the Piano,"I hadn't played the piano since I was in high school. Now in my senior years I was unable to read or play music. With this book, I am now playing music for my own enjoyment. You should buy this book if you want to learn or re-learn the paino."
5,Yesssssss!,"All cds were in excellent condition! I play them every night and they have held up well. I would reccomend u purchase this, definitely."
2,no classic,"when you are used to the classic sitcoms of the 1970's,this show just does not measure up. add to that list, I love lucy and The Honeymooners and what you got here is quite frankly second rate material. again, not a bad show but...here comes MAUDE season 1."
3,No sunshine in a bag!!!,How can they call this a complete season when great scenes are omitted? Buena Vista clearly don't realise that most die hard GG fans are almost word perfect on the dialogue. Very very disappointed and cross!!
4,Lovely!,As per usual I love the Golden Girls and loved this season as well. The product did come in timely manner and was properly packaged.
2,Don't know what to think!,"Very prompt sevice, unfortunately dvd not working on my player or laptop...contacted seller,and they responded right away, send item for refund...send 10 days back, not heard anything yet...still waiting.....That's it for my experience!!"
5,the price is too high,"I ORDER THE FIFTH SEASON TODAY FROM ANOTHER WEBSITE,AMAZON IS GETTING TO HIGH ON THOSE OLD ASS DVDS."
5,"I Love the Golden Girls, But Why No discount?","The Golden Girls season five gets Five stars! But the price doesn't! Why is the price so high? Don't we usually get a discount? I too have purchased seasons 1-4 through Amazon ( like another reviewer)however because of the price hike, I too will be purchasing it from another cheaper store."
5,tphill,Keeping Up Appearances Episode #1.4This episode to me was extra funny. When you watch and see what Hyacinth goes through to keep up appearances.
1,Ugh. The canned laughter is unbearable.,"Canned laughter is always awful but this takes the cake. I have never heard such annoying and FAKE laughter as the first 5 minutes of the first episode. The people were OUTSIDE for crying out loud. Outside means no studio audience. Whoever decided to allow such nonsense, and to such a degree, earns this series a One Star rating. I realize that canned laughter has been with us for many years but I cannot watch this. It's simply too much, too loud, too fake, too often, toodaloo!"
5,Anyone who loves British Comedy...,"probably already knows about KUA. If you don't, where have you been? It is silly and endearing and Hyacinth is still as entertaining today as she was when the series was new. Love, love, love ALL the characters and the ""I love Lucy-ish"" escapades of the irrepressible Mrs. Bucket... er... I mean, Mrs. Bouquet!"
5,Great British Show,"It is a great British show with lots of understandable humor. This is the British version of ""Mama's Family"". The internet streaming was great, as well."
2,meh.,"I bought this more than a year ago and still dont have any use for it. There are too many cards and the board is set up weird. Read the instructions and its hard to make any sense out of what you're supposed to do.So far we have just used the cards to count and play matching. In which case, it was not total waste of money."
2,Not a good biography,"While reading this copy of Power's biography, I kept checking back to the customer reviews that I read before purchase. Most reviews were ""glowing"" for many reasons. Frankly I purchased because the reviews were most favorable from a large number of other Twain biographies. I am sorry that I did.The detail is fine but there is strong failure to tell the life story associated with the detail. Very limited cover of Sammy's youth & developments. Mr. Power is also a fanatical wordsmith. There are a huge amount of words (mostly adjectives)that you will never encounter again in your lifetime."
1,Mark Twain a Life,"I wished I had read all of the reviews because I would not have purchased it. This statement from another: ""This could have, and should have been a five star review, but the author could not help putting his own views on politics, and social commentary."" and this made the book trying and unenjoyable."
3,Rock Star? Puhleeze.,"Ron Powers' MARK TWAIN contains a great deal of valuable material. It is unfortunately marred by Powers' writing style and his unfortunate tendency to compare 19th-century Twain with various 'rock stars'. I don't know if he's trying to popularize Twain with a 'hip young audience' or what, but these anachronistic references were like pickles in a Charlotte Russe. They just don't belong there.It's a pity since there is so much other amazing information on Twain here. The annoying asides have made it very difficult for me to finish the book. I keep putting it aside in disbelief.No, Mark Twain was not a rock star. Got that?"
3,Mark Twain Bio by Ron Powers,"This could have, and should have been a five star review, but the author could not help putting his own views on politics, and social commentary.Mr. Powers you are a very talented wirter, and biographer. However I am not interested in your opinions on these subjects. If I wanted a book (but I dont) on Ron Power's opinions on everything, I would have bought one.This same thing also effects movies. Some directors cannot help doing the same thing. Let me see how can I put this......IT'S REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, ANNOYING!!!!!!!!"
3,"Strong on facts, short on story","This biography is a well written, comprehensive account of Twain's life. What is missing is a coherent, compelling life story or insightful interpretation of Twain's creative process."
3,It could have been a 5,"An excellent biography marred by gratuitous left wing political commentary. I don't know why Mr. Powers decided to sprinkle those little gems throughout the text, given that they add absolutely nothing, but I wish he'd respected his subject--and his readers--enough not to intrude. If I'd wanted Powers' political views, I'd have sought out a book about him. If you can ignore the author's trespassing, it is a worthwhile read."
5,Nice to listen to as well as read,"I wouldn't presume to add anything to the reviews of this book, even if I could. But I didn't find any comments on the quality of the recording, which is worth a note.The reader is the author himself, Ron Powers. He is very easy to listen to. I find myself drifting off less than I usually do, and getting a lot more of the meat of the book. Powers manages to suggest by his voice when the subject changes or a recurrent theme appears and he clearly pronounces the punctuation that he no doubt sweated over. His imitation of Twain's voice isn't quite what I expected after Hal Holbrook, but it works to make the transitions to and from quotations very fluid, and I have begun to think of it as the voice of Twain.All in all, I liked Power's reading as much as those of professional readers. If the book sounds good to you, I am certain you will love the audio CD."
5,Great account of a remarkable American life,"An interesting biography of Mark Twain aka Samuel Clemens, a journalist and a writer.Although he had no formal education, Mark Twain was arguably the best English language writer since Shakespeare, with his greatest contribution to the American literature being the novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.Mark Twain traveled around the world, and had a great sense of humanityHe was a patriot who loved his country and the 19th century. But he condemned his American society for its hypocrisy. He was anti-colonial and anti-imperialist. He condemned the US for the invasion of Cuba and the Philippines, and the annexation of its neighbor, Mexico."
4,Good quality for the price,"I am not one to order jewelry online, and had second thoughts after I ordered this necklace, however upon receipt, I was more than happy with the quality. My only criticism would be that I felt the chain was a little light, however I find this in much jewelry these days. Overall a good product for a good price with the usual prompt Amazon service."
3,"cute, process makes sense, but scratched","I bought this product for an overseas move, so I have not used it yet; but I looked it over thoroghly when it arrived and it makes sense from a physics perspective. It's basically a mini percolator, and people have been using those forever :-)My problem was that the first one arrived scratched, so I sent for another one; the replacement is even worse scratched, so I'm sending it back and keeping the original. I don't know if this is a Typhoon problem or an Amazon problem, but it's frustrating..."
1,total..junk,i coulda made this albulm using canned loops from Acid Music. Underground is where this albulm should stay... tedious and disjointed - puke.
5,Meliah Rage Kicks A#$,Meliah Rage plays music ahead of their time. They change beat in their songs much like Sabbath used to. Deep and Dreamless Sleep is by far their best album in my opinion but none of their work has been in the least disappointing. I highly recommend Meliah Rage for all serious rock fans.
2,So Cheesy!,"I have been a Meliah Rage fan since 1988. I love Mike Munro's Meliah Rage. This new stuff they are coming out with since they ""reformed"" is trash. Really. If you like your lyrical content about as deep and smart as pro wrestling then this is your album. The music is VERY disappointing. They waited 2 years to release this. I suppose it took them that amount of time to get the backbone to release this trash on their fans. I recommend you find their pre-2000 releases for real metal. This is a travesty. Truly."
1,What you see is not what you get...,"Ordered this $60.00 chain. From the picture, it looked to be a nice substantial chain to be given to my one year old grandchild. When I received the chain, I was extremely disappointed. The chain is ridiculously flimsy and light weight. One yank and it will break. I had planned to purchase two additional chains but have changed my mind for the price to value is just not there."
2,Fey Step Bumper for Ford E-350 SV,Fair quality. Step is narrower than the OEM. Probably should have paid the extra $100 for the OEM bumper.
3,Buttons are hard to push,I was not really happy with this product. The buttons are difficult to push.It is not easy to use or quick to set. Very touchy.I just use a regular timer tied to a shoestring now and it meets my needs much better for less money.
5,Enjoying playing amplified acoustic bass with pickup,"Pickup works great, puts together in about 30 minutes, simple and precise instructions. Have only played it in an enclosed area so far and still working out ways to eliminate feedback at higher volume. Deep bass; crisp, ""stringy"" highs. Sounds clear when bowed. Looking forward to hearing this kit out or on stage."
3,Olivella Virgin Olive Oil face soap!,This would be a 5 if it did not have fragrance to it. The oil itself is wonderful - only natural ingredients.
5,Love it!,This is a standard in my home. My husband loves the scent and I love the fact that my skin doesn't dry out after using this soap.
1,A Waste of Time,Elaine Siegel has written a book in which she openly presents her negative countertransference toward her lesbian patients as a clinical modality to change their sexual identities. What is most amazing about this book is that the author is so open about her contempt for her lesbian patients.
1,Failed within 13 months!,I bought this set for my husband's shop and he is the only person to use it. Two days ago the DVD player stopped dead. We used the cleaner and it worked fine with that. We played a CD on it and that worked fine but the DVD will not work and it will cost us almost 2/3 of the purchase price to see if we can get it repaired. I am very disappointed in this item. It is the second Toshiba DVD player that has stopped working with no warning. I won't be buying this brand again.
1,3 of 3 units failed within weeks of purchase,"I initially purchased two units. One failed intermittently and the other failed completely. I returned the one and received a new one from the factory. It failed within a week. Additionally, the one that failed intermittently has rolled over for good.The failure of all three was the power. They would all shut off immediately after they were turned on...within a second or two."
5,Bend it Like Beckham Scores!,"Bend it Like Beckham is the story of an Indian girl living in England who is obsessed with Manchester United soccer captain, David Beckham. The story follows her as she tries to wins her parents over to the idea of letting her play soccer with a local girls team. The family is not keen on the idea and try to force her into a more traditional role in the home. She secretly keeps playing, and the team wins several big matches. There is also a love interest with her coach and a lot of confusion with her family over her relationship with a team mate.The film is totally charming and you find yourself cringing, laughing and cheering throughout. It also touches on issues of body, sexuality, tradition,race and family without being too cliche or forced. It is a definate must see, and I can't wait to buy it on DVD!"
4,Bend it Like Beckham,"A fun culturally rich movie for all people, Bend it Like Beckham is a bittersweet movie about love, dreams, and family. Jessi desperately wants to play soccer, and when a girl named Juli invites her to join a soccer team, a rift is placed in Jessi's family as she is conflicted with following her dreams or following tradition.This movie focuses big on tradition and first loves. It's a good movie to show to a soccer team. The homosexual jokes became a little old (what is up with the British obsession with homosexuality?), and the movie didn't concentrate nearly enough on the reasons why Jess' family wanted to protect her. This is a cute movie, however, and the faults are quickly forgiven."
3,Nice but,I liked it - but way too much foul language and inappropriate content. Really nice story but could have done without some of the profanity and adult situations.
3,A llttle too precious & P.C. for my taste,"This film virtually takes the hackneyed plot of the Jazz Singer and exchanges the gender and ethnicity of the protaganist. They also took the schmaltz. (BOTH girls get soccer scholarships?!)The two girls are enchanting, although Keira Knightley looks positively anorexic. A couple of unnecessary makeout scenes keep this from being a family film."
2,Just alright...,"All in all this film appeals less about the world of soccer than it does to your typical everyday relationship flick. The comedy in this film is forced and anyone knowing a great deal about football will come away quite embarrased as to how a movie made in the breadbasket of the sport comes out so juvenille. The way soccer is treated here is almost like it was treated in the Disney flick ""The Big Green"" or ""Ladybugs.""If really looking for a film that correctly describes the obessive passions associated with soccer and how it relates to relationships pick up ""Fever Pitch."""
2,Formulaic,"Although this movie had its moments, I have probably seen too many formulaic cross-cultural movies and this reminded me of all of them combined. It had everything: the disappointed, but ultimately approving parents, the cross-cultural displacements, the gay (in/out of the closet) best friend, the happy ending home-run/goal/etc., etc. etc. etc. Most people will think I am too harsh, but if you've seen a hundred, you've seen them all."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie and reading these reviews before watching it raised my expectations. But I found this story to be way too predictable. The characters, especially the mothers, were made out to be cardboard stereotypes rather than characters with any complexity. I was hoping to share this with my 13 year old niece but it was such a yawn I think I'll spare her. Funny? I found myself rolling my eyes but not laughing. Also I had to watch it with the subtitles on because there was so much rapid-fire mumbling. I am amazed this got such good reviews. I did like learning about Indian culture and rituals. The very talented actors did a great job with a weak, predictable script."
3,If you like formula movies...,"...you'll like 'Bend It Like Beckham'. A little ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" with expatriate Indians. VERY predictable. It's not giving away a THING to tell you Dad relents at the last moment and daughter scores the winning goal in the big game. Forbidden love interest? Of course!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,Do not buy this DVD! The studio did a rush job on the transfer and the video/sound quality has suffered!! BEWARE!!
1,Save time and money,"I just watched this movie and I feel disappointed. The original idea is very good and was for more, instead the film turns in to a cheese soap opera which I just wanted to stop. The only good thing I came out with is that I learn a little bit about the beautiful Indian traditions which seem to me they were presented a little bit exaggerated to attract westerners."
5,perfect for a soccer fans collection,"If you love soccer movies, you probably have this film. Very good story of love, passion, following your dreams, and goals!"
3,ain't bad but a bit to much hype,I dig the Diversity of the Film&the Soccer element gets you in but the downside is the generic story line&also the Predictablity of the film wears itself thin after a while. still it has some decent moments to keep you watching for a while.it's not bad but a bit on the Over-Hype factor.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED IN QUALITY!,"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this DVD as a couple of friends had recommended it. When it arrived, I made some popcorn & was looking forward to watching it. I was extremely disappointed that due to the quality of the DVD, I never even got to see the ending!"
3,Not a family film,"This movie was recommended to me, so I was eager to see it, but was disappointed. While the movie did have some thought-provoking pictures of the culture clashes that resulted when Indian immigrant parents raise their not-so-Indian daughter in England, I did not think it at all appropriate for children. It included frequent British and American profanities, sex outside of marriage, disrobing girls in a locker room, lying to parents resulting in a positive outcome, ridicule for those who don't accept homosexuality, and a positive portrayal of homosexuality. These last two items would only bother those of us who remain happily politically incorrect. This movie is not without some redeeming qualities for adults looking for light entertainment, especially if you enjoy the cross-cultural content, but I don't recommend this for family viewing."
4,Funny and Entertaining,"A hilarious film. My family laughed and laughed. Titled for David Beckham with just enough soccer to satisfy soccer fans, but not too much to bore the non-soccer crowd. There is a very funny scene involving older relatives of the main character -- a pre-wedding get together where everyone is dressed in traditional clothing yet when a cell phone rings during the party EVERYONE, including the grandmothers, thinks it is their cell phone ringing. The main character's family is conflicted between traditional versus modern life. One sister choosing the traditional and the other choosing a different path. A very entertaining movie. Can't wait to see it again once it opens in the U.S. in April 2003."
4,Delightful Fun,"This movie is unpretentious, pure, heartfelt fun. The story is laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish. The opening scene, in which Jess dreams of being a soccer star broadcast on TV, immediately sets the tone of the film and draws you in. The soccer scenes are great, but not so dominating that those of us unversed in matters of sports can't follow. Watch out for Keira Knightley's spirited acting and her hilarious relationship with her homophobic mother. Oh, and don't press the ""stop"" button before the closing credits end."
4,Cool movie!,"At first, I thought this would be just another chick-flick, but let me reassure you that it's not. This movie mixes in some good humor and life lessons."
3,Those silly brits.,"Bend It Like Backham is a cute and harmless family film. Keira Knightley proudly shows off her rock-hard abs while Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a nice piece of eye candy, hubba hubba! Good sports film but some of the dialogue is pretty laughable, a mixed bag for me so decide for yourself."
3,Question on Bend it like Beckham,How does this movie discuss the tradition roles of men and women? What personal conflicts does Jess face as a result of cultural conflicts within her home? Can u identify stereotyping within the film?
1,Really.Sucky.Movie.,"Nothing about this movie was interesting. To write a long review would almost imply that I was interested enough to pay attention to detail. The football scenes didn't even make it interesting. All I learned from this movie was it's ok to lie to my folks and sulk through my sister's special day b/c I couldn't make a match.Too predictable for more words than this. If you are in teh mood for a crapfest, watch this."
1,"this is a bad movie, it sends a bad message for tenage girls","The underlying message I found in this movie was: It's OK to lie to and decieve your parents, if you think their wrong and you are right. Then if they find out, and punish and order you to stop, it OK to do it again as long as you think the action may lead to some good.I was hopeing to see some intresting soccer moves, espicialy since this movie was named after a great soccer player, but the lead charachter in the movie is an Indian girl, David Beckham doesn't even have a speaking role in the movie, just a three second walk past the camera at the end of the movie."
1,Stupid British - Indian Girly movie!,Don't buy this DVD. It's realy a waste of money. Bad acting and an even worse and boring script. No imagination at all! A girl that likes to play football and her parents don't want her to. Wow! How original! Was it hard to write a script like that! STAY AWAY!!!
5,Bend It Like Beckham,I bought this dvd at the request of my daughter as a surprize Christmas present. We really enjoyed this movie so I was happy to locate this on your site and have it in time for Christmas.
5,Absolutely fantastic,"United was showing this movie on a twelve-hour ride across the Atlantic, as well as three other mediocre-looking ones. I decided to watch Bend it Like Beckham first, and the next three after. Well, guess what - I ended up watching this movie four times in a row. I don't even LIKE soccer one bit, but I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! It has something for everyone. Great soundtrack, fabulous actors, and a fantastic premise - Indian girl (living in Britain) wants to play soccer, but parents say no. The whole movie is a funny, fresh look at culture clashes, girl-power in the sports world, and of course ""following your dream"". ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I can't say it enough. This movie was the best I'd seen in a long, long time. Go out and rent/buy this right away. You won't regret it (I guarantee)."
3,soccer,This was a present for my young granddaughter who loves playing soccer on her school team. She enjoyed the movie.
4,bend it,Bend it Like Beckham offers a unique opportunity to see Asians as the focus of a film. The main character is British of Indian heritage. It is a good coming of age movie. She struggles with living a life that does not fit in the values of a traditional Indian family. It is humorous. The misunderstandings between the girls and the parents bring about good laughs.
4,Loved it!,"I wasn't in that big of a hurry to watch this movie, but once I started it, I fell in love with it. I had never heard of Parminder Nagra (Jess), but boy did she leave a lasting impression! This film is about an Indian girl (Nagra) that plays football (soccer to the Americans) and how it affects her (expected) traditional life of her family. She is so beautiful and talented and with the rest of the cast makes this film unforgettable. Highly recommended!!"
5,Great Movie!!!,"I love cross cultural movies and books and this is one of the finest I've seen. The book ""Veil of Roses"" is also a great example of how two cultures can blend very nicely into one."
5,Beckham's Bull's-eye!,"This movie, like, ""Greek Wedding,"" needs to move beyond the ""art houses"" in order to spread its theme of ""to thine own self be true."" Character development and plot are strongly supported by the engaging and believable performances of an ensemble cast of actors. Colorful sets, costumes, tantalizing food, music that draws you into the story (and makes you want to rush out and buy the soundtrack!) as well as the opportunity for ample laughter generated by the clash, crash and kiss of the co-mingling of Hindu and Anglo cultures create an entirely satisfying experience from start to finish. It delivers a powerful message that is both entertaining and edifying. A must see for everyone. A movie for our time!"
5,Bend it like Beckham ROCKS!,"I loved this movie! It shows that if you put your mind to something you really like you will excell in the thing you are doing. Even if you aren't a soccer fan, you will still love this movie! Bend it Like Beckham scores!"
4,Bend it like Beckham,"I saw Bend it like Beckham on the television. I am only quite young but I thought it was extremely entertaining. The plot was in places predictable but mostly was quite twisty-turny - the acting was almost always very good - a few lapses, but never mind. I thought the plot was extremely interesting and the asian/sikh cultural referances were fun, interesting and informative. I would definitely recommend seeing this. Even my Dad, who is often quite scornful about things like this, ended up watching it with me! I thought it was brilliant!!"
4,A Nice Soccer Story!,Missed this in the theaters but BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM works two ways. First asa good family movie and second as a good soccer movie. Recommended!Soccer Coaching:Schupak's Soccer 6 Pack DVD SetSoccer coaches and leagues will love this DVD set by Marty Schupak.
5,Wow!,"What a great film! Great acting, beautiful women, great story. It definitely provides motivation to go after your dreams. Make sure you go see this movie right away."
4,Bend It Like Becks With A Smile,"Absolutely wonderful football movie. Two young football-playing girls aspire to turn professional despite culture issues (one, Jess, is Indian, where footballer girls are frowned upon). The script is amusing, the direction tight and the acting amusing, brilliant, and dead on. From first frame to last you'll find yourself with an ever-growing smile."
2,Not great,"I beg to differ. The scenes in this book were repetitive and the grandmother too butch for a woman, especially this woman. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because I liked the Doberman Pincher in the novel..."
3,No es su mejor trabajo,"De todas las obras de Buero Vallejo que he leido, ésta quizás no sea de las mejores. Sí que sabe capturar los estereotipos de la España de la posguerra como nadie, pero en esta obra los caracteres son, más que estereotipos, unas caricaturas de la época. No me quedé con un buen sabor de boca al acabar de leer."
4,I can relate,Henry James amazes me on how well he can write about a woman and her inner self. This book portrays the struggles of a young woman and the challenges she has to face in life. Not sure of what she wants the wrong choices seem to be made. The books ending leaves the reader wondering if true love will finally find Isabel Archer in the form of Casper Goodwood. Hmmmmm....
3,"Fiction writers, nota bene","Some fictional works retell the stories of other fictional works but from a different point of view. The retellings may occupy roughly the same time as the story they are retelling. Examples are John Gardner's novel Grendel (Beowulf), Tom Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Hamlet), and M. Z. Bradley's novel The Mists of Avalon (King Arthur). The retellings may fill in a bit of fictional history that the original story only touches on. Examples are Jean Rhys's novel Wide Sargasso Sea (Jane Eyre) and Haire-Sargeant's H: The Story of Heathcliff's Journey Back to Wuthering Heights (Wuthering Heights). As a subject of such treatments, Portrait of a Lady seems ripe for the picking. Surely Gilbert Osmond and Madame Merle have their own story to tell apart from the events in the novel, and most likely they have their own version of the events that they share with Isabel Archer."
2,ugh,"Maybe three stars would be a more fair rating....After all, who am I to ""rate"" a classic like Portrait of a Lady. We read what must have been an abridged version (Norton Critical Edition) in my freshman English class at college and I hated it. All that I could see was that Isabel Archer was this free-spirited person whose soul was being crushed by a pretentious, snobby Englishman. Unfortunately I have reacted to other Victorian fiction that way too, but I'm trying to improve.....Several months ago I made the monumental attempt of reading the novel again(unabridged) and it didn't seem quite as awful this time, but I still couldn't bring myself to read the whole thing. Two thirds through the book I began falling asleep every time I'd pick it up. Maybe when I'm eighty I'll have more patience and energy for Henry James, though truly, I did enjoy it this time, quite a bit more. I just couldn't stay awake long enough to finish it."
2,Portrait of a Lady,"The book is very wordy which tends to make it a slow read. Otherwise, I did enjoy the storyline."
2,C-,"okay, so i'm fourteen, and by most standards ""too young"" to be reading and reviewing this book, but this is America and for all you know i'm really a forty year old housewife looking for something amusing to do.The conversation at times is hard to follow: pages upon pages of wordy, witty observations and pointless chit-chat. Plus, Isabel is just too darn conceited - she's in love with herself (that's why she turned down a few guys before picking the wrong one).It does have its good points...but I'm more inclined to Jane Austen or the Brontes - they at least have sensible heroins.I totally agree with Ahmedabah (scroll down and you'll find his review) - except the version I read had 645 pages, and what he said about American girls! We're really not all that bad, you know."
1,"Some parts of it are interesting, but most isn't",the reason I began reading this book was because I was given no alternative by my school. I don't see Isabel Archer as snobbish at all.
4,Skeet shotting advice from ESPN,"Frank Little, former Olympian, and the producers from ESPN bring you a full length video on skeet shotting fundamentals.He breaks down the differences between each skeet station, learn how to anticipate each shot, helps improve consistency & overall shooting success, and uses computer graphics to show you how to get set for each shot.You also learn how to pre-aim, and when to pull the trigger. Some of the shots use a gun cam - fun to watch, as well as educational. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars."
3,indoor boomerangs are better,"the wind makes it harder to turn, the speed is very fast, you can't catch it unless you wear baseball gloves and you need a huge area to throw it, don't even think in a parking lot!...is not accurate no matter how you throw it."
1,Ordered a boomerang - got a jumprope,"So, I ordered the ""Spirit of Earth"" boomerang for my son for Christmas. I just received it a few minutes ago, but the shipped product is a ""Chinese Jump Rope."" There is an inventory sticker on the jumprope saying that it's a boomerang, but it obviously is not.Now, the thumbnail preview of the boomerang shows the jumprope, but when you click on the product, it still shows the boomerang. Not sure what the mix up is."
4,Fun for Dad and son,"I am not sure who enjoys this boomerang the most, my brother (60) or his six year old son. I know that they managed to destroy the first one in a little less than a year... but they insisted on the same boomerang as a replacement. I think it spent a lot of time stuck in a tree in the weather and that might have weakened it... but now they have their replacement and the fun begins again."
3,Breaks after a few throws,"i used it about two times on the park. i was not able to catch it all. and after a few landings it breaks in two pieces.As i mentioned i was on the park, that means it lands on the grass. Fun for 1 hour that lasted."
1,No Boomerang - Jump Rope Instead,"After reading the reviews and comments about these products I ordered two to give as gifts.But once I finally received them - instead of receiving two ""Spirit of the Earth"" boomerangs (which are what I ordered) I received 2 Chinese jump ropes.And apparently I'm not the only one (see the picture someone added above).So now I have two kids who are missing their promised gifts... If anyone knows of some good boomerangs to get for kids (ages 8-13) I would be most grateful to learn about them!"
2,Boomerang,"I purchased this boomerang for my son, however after receiving it I noticed it was for people who throw right-handed. I will have to save this for someone else, or return it."
4,Nice toy for outside fun,"Good boomerang overall, but needs to be improved in terms of durability. We had lots of fun playing with it. One more thing to consider if you buy it: no options to choose the right one for left-handed person."
5,Boomerangin',"This boomerang is by far the best one out of the Spirit of Fire and Spirit of Wind. It came back to me more than either of the other ones did. Once you teach and learn from experience with boomerangs, you can have them come back to you more each time they are thrown. This one may be more expensive than the other ones, but is worth the money!"
5,The real deal,"My son asked for a boomerang for Christmas and so to Amazon.com I went! This boomerang is a full blown, real deal boomerang, not a kids toy. Of course it's a kids toy but if you throw it correctly (my husband enjoyed hours of getting it just right) it will fly out pretty darn far and come right back for you to catch. This would be a great gift for an outdoors-y person. I have to take my son to an open to field to use it since there are too many things I'd rather not have to pay for in our neighborhood and learning it is a skill! Very cool to own though and not just for kids!!"
4,I would recomend this toy,"I got this boomerang as a birthday present. I was very excited, but at first I couldn't get it to work correctly. Then I later looked up how to throw a boomerang on youtube. After that I took it out and it flew perfectly for me. It was just a matter of learning how to throw it."
1,It's all about him,"Steer clear of this pretentious unscientific book. It is an exercise in self-promotion for a mediocre musician who is using the subject of birdsong to effuse about the ""wonders of nature"" (and himself). There are much better books on this subject -- get ""The Singing Life of Birds"" by Donald Kroodsma instead."
1,Unscientific and pretentious,"Rothenberg is a New Age writer and musician that enjoys playing music to birds and jamming their singing with the sound from different wind instruments. Surey lots of fun. However, it is from this perspective that he attemps to understand why birds sing. To be true, he does review some scientific papers and provides a not too bad coverage of the findings of the scientific literature. But Rothenberg enjoys exposing the shortcomings of this research (rather pretentiously by the way) and coming up with unscientific ideas of his own based on his feelings about why birds should spend so much time singing. He seriously believes that his empathic method of blowing desceding fifths and chromatic scales with his clarinet to singing birds can take him a long way into understanding the misteries of bird song. Good luck to him."
1,not for badminton,This product came up when searching for badminton nets. Not for badminton... rather this is for volleyball. Shuttle coco could go right through net as net spacing is wide. Not sure how good this product is for volleyball but it should not come up when searching for badminton.
5,Like being there!,"This e-book is so thorough that it is just like being at a portrait-sculpture workshop without the price tag of $500 to $1,000 or more! It contains everything you ever wanted to know and if you still have a question, you can access the Heidi Maiers web page and ask! The chapter on proportions of every head would be useful to painters as well as sculptors."
3,Nothing new...,"This is not an 'original' band, as has been suggested, but rather a band who produces ok music that is VERY reminiscent of early Kinks and, somewhat, The Velvet Underground...and both of the ladder are far more interesting, dynamic and original. This CD is alright background music but it isn't compelling/inspiring enough to stand on its own."
3,Compilation meets standards,"If you're like me, you would have painstakingly collected every EP as they came out, which was fairly expensive considering that they were imports. Now it's compiled into one lump sum and available on every shelf in AMERICA and EUROPE, which is great because Belle and Sebastian is my favorite band of all time, but sort of unfortunate."
2,Okay but...,"After discovering what a great vocalist Engelbert is, i then wanted to study his life but this biography leaves a lot to be desired. He did not go into details about key moments throughout his life and it seems he is holding back something through the whole book. His infidelities were handled with a surgeons glove, which is fine if he is protecting those closest to him and the guilty ones involved but his life with his showbiz friends and insights to his world were full of shadowy figures and leaves us in the dark most of the book. I'd love to have read about his spirituality and his innermost thoughts on how he sings the way he does would have been a start. If this is a ""revealing"" biography he forgot to be revealing. He is still one of the greatest vocalists to ever sing."
5,I finally did it!!!,"I read Engelbert's Biography and I found it very interesting. Many events in the book were stated with the up most honesty. Most biography's are written with only the good things the person wants you to know. Engelbert and his wife tell you his story just as it was. I have never read a book in just 2days,but I couldn't put the book down. I am a great fan of Engelbert for over 30yrs and I'm sure anyone who reads this book will enjoy it."
4,Good item at a reasonable price,Produced crispy foods quickly but be careful not to overload it.You must use a lightly used electrical circuit or it can trip the breaker. It takes a long time to heat up but recovers after the first batct quickly for a frier this large. I recommend it.
1,Dazed and Confused!!,"After reading mostly rave reviews on this fryer, I ordered it with great anticipation. I should have heeded the other reviews and purchased a different fryer. Taking the advice of several reviewers, I tried keeping the temperature at 350 degrees instead of 375 while frying battered fish in one basket and french fries in the other one. The fish stuck to it's basket and the fries were brown and soggy. So, I tried the same scenario with the temp at 375. The fish still stuck to the basket; the fries were still brown and soggy. Even tried the ""twice-fried"" method for the fries with no significant improvement in the crispness factor. I was also disappointed with the long cooking time as another reviewer noted.After a VERY LONG, tiring and trying cooking experience, I scrambled for my old faithful large pot, piled in Crisco and lovingly dropped in the rest of the fish. Ta-Da!! PERFECTION! Needless to say, I am giving away this frying fiasco."
1,Just Say NO!,"I purchased this fryer after the death of our previous deep fryer thinking you get what you pay for. So I splurged. Yes, I read the reviews which had a lot to do with my decision to purchase this particular fryer - mistake....No one explains that the plug is extremely short or the fact that the magnet holding this heavy cord has a difficult time keep it plugged into the fryer.The temperature doesn't seem to stay consistent as my previous fryer - yes, I know that adding food to the oil will reduce the temp.After only 6 months with average use of once per month - it's dead.Beware"
3,it's okay; good for the money,"this is the first micro/digital I've purchased. Level of quality is about low to average, but the price is right. The on/off switch could be easier to engage/disengage and the other buttons require a good amount of pressure too, but depending on where you keep it, that may be a plus if you don't want it to do things accidentally.Size/weight is perfect, mostly one hand operations. VOX works well, although the on/off resets to the (VOX) off position every time you turn the unit off. Another nice feature is the intro.scan, but you have to turn on the function and it also resets itself (to off) every time you turn the unit off. It will take about 20 minutes to learn all the functions."
2,"For the price...ah, -- you may be happy, or you may not.....","good things:its lightweight, ------ thin,---------- capable of recording many short or long messages.-------- volume control has good range of levels.-------- read-out has large numbers and handy information-------- easy to use and understand -------- external mic can be added-------- plug for device to hook up to phone and record telephone conversations.---- -------------------------------- negative things: sound quality is awful. Long messages sound worse than short ones-----buttons are too small for big fingers, or for others who have long finger nails.------ Does not come with a case of any kind, in my opinion requires a thin, fabric, or anything type case to avoid small scratches and scuff marks that appear so easily, I got an edge scuffed just getting it out of the package!----"
4,For the price not too bad at all,"I got this just so I could make notes to myself and replay them later on and this is an ideal product. It is easy to use, small and lightweight. The only drawback is that the sound quality is not all that great, but that is a minor drawback since Im not using it for music and the quality is easily discernible. ...It was a bargain."
2,Not great...,"I just wanted to use this for personal memos, so I'd have some way to keep track of things I think of while driving. I had real trouble working the controls, & the front ends of memos were consistently clipped. The voice activation feature just moves the (clipped) words forward in the memo; the dead air is still in the memo taking up memory at the end. I had so much trouble getting this thing to turn on and off when I wanted it to, and in understanding my memos when I played them back, that I gave up on it."
1,No Reliability,"My first unit died in 2 weeks when the DVD player door would not close. The replacement unit has now died 5 months later exactly as stated in a couple of the other reviews (power problem): it turns itself off. Always been happy with Toshiba before, but not anymore. Stay away from this one."
2,brokedown within 4 months,"I like the price and size, but after only four months, the DVD wasn't working and I had to bring it to a technician, that took over a month to fix it. Even with the warranty, it still cost almost $100 to fix. I could have bought a new one!!"
1,Toshiba combo unit fails after 95 days,"I purchased the TV-DVD combo unit for use in the kitchen and was initially very pleased with it. However, shortly after the warranty expired (90 days), the unit failed to power on correctly. Push the power button...little flicker...nothing. I thought Toshiba was supposed to be a respectable brand. The repair shop I talked with suggested that I donate it to a school that teaches electronics repair."
1,Terrible,After owning this TV/DVD player for three months it has broken down repeatedly and I'm going to be charged $95 to take it to a technician. Don't bother.
1,junk,"My review will continue along the same vien as the rest: JUNK AFTER 90 DAYS! Warning to potential buyers-- there are power problems with this tv -- the power light comes on for a nanosecond than fades and the TV does not work after several months. If don't mind losing $175 in Vegas, this tv is for you. I would not buy this TV/DVD combo."
1,Broke down in 5 months!,Nice TV for 5 months. It then developed power problems and the warranty only covers parts after 3 months. I would need to pay $80 just to have a technician look at it. Extremely disappointed!
1,Toshiba Junk!!,"I am having the same power problems. I called Toshiba, spent 20 mins on hold then was transferred to someone else only to have my call dropped without speaking to anyone about my TV. I called back and spent about another 15 mins on hold before speaking to someone who told me it was probably the powerboard. The part alone costs over 100$. This TV is not even worth fixing. The Toshiba company has poor customer service and I will NEVER but Toshiba anything ever again!"
5,The Complete and Utter Truth,I thought that this book was one of the best books i have ever read. I could relate to the characters completly. Luna had the outcast ( Doreen) talk back to the ever so popular girls who used her just so they could hurt her and Ted. That makes you think that if she can do it we can become our true selves as well. The book is not only entertaining but inspiring weather or not you are the popular one or the outcast this is a book to read if your not exactly sure who you are quit yet.
4,This book is real and true,"I loved this book!! Yes, Doreen is a bit bitter and depressing sometimes but hasn't every teenager been that way at one point in their lives. Doreen is a real character who I can relate to. Reading this book makes you think about your family, friends, and even your relationships with people in general. Brave New Girl shows that people aren't perfect but they can make up for it in other ways. After I read this book I felt stronger and said things I never could say before."
4,"A Fresh, Entertaining Book","When I first picked up Brave New Girl, I thought it would be another dreadfully identical teenage angst book with a girl who hates her parents and hates her friends. But no, Brave New Girl never failed to amaze me. Following Doreen throughout her life is new and exciting, as she goes through the perils of childhood. It surprized me that Brave New Girl was actually laugh aloud funny, on numerous occasions because it doesn't look like it would be. The book is fun to read, and despite the fact that it isn't extremely long, the story is so captivating it's hard to put it down without wanting more."
5,FANTASTIC,"This is truly an amazing book. The author takes you deep inside the mind of a young girl and nearly crushes you with the experience. The language is strong and pure, and the voice of Doreen pulled me through the book like a steel hook. It gripped me. I don't usually like books about 'girls growing up', but this is a true work of art. I've never heard of this author before, but I'm sure we'll hear of her again. I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,A Brave Book,"This book touches on some very serious topics, and handles it in the most delicate way. A coming of age story for young Doreen brings her from young teenager, to cultured youth by the end of the story. This book is a very easy read, i sat down one night and before i knew it i was done with the book. It lacks depth, but overall an easy and enjoyable read."
5,Honest,"As a 15 year old girl I was able to relate to the main character Doreen. This book covers a vast majority of important topics I believe every teenage girl know. Dating, sex, temptation, best friends, dangerous friends, drugs, alcohol, parties, difficult parents, are all shown to you raw and in real life situations that I as an active teen was able to relate to."
4,Interesting,"This story is about Doreen, a fourteen year old girl who is not yet sure who she is or where she belongs in the world. Doreen's often mixed and confused feelings are expressed well in the novel. She is attracted to, yet uncomfortable around her sister's boyfriend. She worries about her best friend Ted, who is bullied by classmates, but is sometimes angry and disgusted when he won't stand up for himself. She wants to fit in with her peers yet dislikes them and their treatment of Ted. When her sister's boyfriend rapes her, Doreen find in herself a strength she never had before.My only complaint is that the book is a little too self-consciously hip, but if you can get past that, it's a touching and interesting read."
1,depressing,"I wish I could give this book 0 stars. It showed teenagers in the wrong light. The main character, Doreen is this angry, depressed 14 year old who hates everything. Everyone else in the book, except for Ted of course, was portrayed as evil people who deserved to be f-worded by Doreen because they like something that she hates, like singing along to commercials. It hardly has a plot and the whole book reads like Doreen sharing with us everything she hates and wants to swear about. The reason I bought this book was that I saw the ad on MTV and the title ""Brave New Girl"" together with the pretty colors on the cover made it look like an empowering sort of book. But, I was wrong. I'd recomend this book to angry, depressed teenagers who would like to get more angry and depressed."
1,i dont get it,"This book left me totally confused, I didn't even know she was raped for most of it. Almost every other word is f*** and I know real teens dont talk like that. I mean we all say it but not to the point where it has to be in every sentence. I dont really understand what the plot was or if there was one. Maybe I just dont get it but this is one of the worst books I've ever read."
1,Brave New Girl,Although the thinking of this book was interesting Louisa Luna only captured the little things and then seemed to go off. She talked about several characters that could've been rather significant in this book yet only mentioned them once & then never talked about them again. This book is easy reading and could be read in one day but i don't think it's worth reading. If Luna put more effort into this book it could've been much better. I personally don't recommend this book to anyone but if your up for light reading then this book is good for you.
2,A little overdone,"All in all, the book isn't bad. I know some could complain of the language, but I understand that Louise Luna is simply trying to convey Doreen's message in a way true to the character, and it works. Unfortunately, the portrayal of a standoffish, aloof teenager has already been over-capitalized on. It's a bit tired, to tell the truth, and a little formulaic. Personally, I thought Salinger's Holden Caulfield already covered this (in a timeless and universal way), but I guess the voice of disillusioned youth will always have its fans. Rather a female version of ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the sort of book often sponsored by MTV. Not really my cup of joe, but it's not terribly bad.Final note: Be aware that this follows in the footsteps of the Molly Bloom-James Joycean stream-of-consciousness. If you like a nice sequencial chain of events, or things spelled out directly, this isn't for you."
2,whatever happened to developing a plot,"I went into reading this book with high hopes as it is another book by the same publisher as ""perks of being a wallflower"" however...it never seemed to go anywhere and I just waited and waited for something interesting to happen...but oh well...can't get everything you wish for. Not a bad light read."
1,"Hmm, MTV Had to Make One Mistake","Since MTV started publishing books, I've been following them closely. The Perks of Being a Wallflower holds a place in my heart as my favorite book of all time, as a matter of fact. So, when I saw Brave New Girl and it seemed like a Perks kind of book from the female perspective, I was very excited. How disappointing! Doreen is a bitter character. Events are clear clear clear until the turning point, when everything is described cryptically. And it just spirals downward from there. I guess even MTV had to make a mistake on publishing a book. I know there are better, fresher, more optimistic voices out there. We don't need to have a happy story, but a 14-year-old character who is this jaded and this obscene just isn't necessary. If you're looking for a really good read that is as good as the summary of this one sounds, go for Perks instead. You won't be sorry."
2,"well written, I'll give it that","It was well written, i enjoyed reading it, good storyline, it was completely ruined when i looked at the last page, advertising other books from the MTV publisher, it reads ""More from the young, the hip, and the up-and-coming."" which i find completely hypocritical. if you read the book you'd understand. the heroin is completely unhip. and the ad is oozing with hip. it made me mad."
1,Horrible,"I don't understand how someone could possibly say this book was any good. The characters were dull and undeveloped. The plot had too many strings. The author spent too much time trying to make the main character ""deep."" She also spent too much time trying to make this book be like the phenomenal, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" Please, don't waste time reading this book. It's really a joke."
2,a sorry disappointment,"When i looked at the table of contents, i saw a pretty impressive list of poets and quite a few surprises. then i read hass's essay, which was great. the problem is hass's taste in poetry. very few of the poems in here should have even been considered for this volume. even from poes who have proved time and again that they are good poets have bad poems in here. beside hass's introduction, the only redeeming part of the book is the contributor's notes and comments."
4,A good overview of US poetry,"Normally, I love these ""best of"" collections. It provides a broad enough poetry base, so that the average reader can find some poetry that they really connect with and pursue. This volume does that for sure, but in the words of the Hass (the editor) he felt stifled under the structure of the book. He had some interesting ideas about grouping the poems by year, or by the age of the poet. But alas, structure prevails and the poems are in alphabetical order of the author's last name. Is it worth it? Of course it is. Will it blow the top off of your head? Probably not."
1,why nobody reads poetry.,want to know why nobody reads poetry anymore? read the first 58 pages of this book and you will know. 58 pages is all of my free time that i could justify wasting. page after page of dull words thrown up by pretentious people with next to nothing to say. truly horrible.
2,Too much literature and not enough poetry,"This series is becoming more and more boring with time. The main reason is that it is more and more ""intelectual"" and smells university. Many poems are well written by today's standards, but that may just be the best way to write a bad poem. A bad poem can be considered good literature, but many good ones were considered in their time bad literature. I didn't buy this book, I read a lot of pages in the store and didn't even find three poems to make me part from my 15 bucks. The other volumes I have just sit in my library and just one or two poems in the 4 volumes I have really hit the score and make want to come back again. Want a good american anthology? Then go fot Alan kaufman's ""The Outlaw bible of American poetry"". Another good one is the ""vintage book of American poetry"". I hope someone tries to compete with this series because there is a lot of great stuff going on, the editors here seem to be fishing in the wrong waters."
2,Yawn,"The same old poets writing the same old poem, year after year. Even Dean Young is beginning to sound a little too ""Dean Youngy"" for his own good. Hass really scoured the journals to find a good representation of the best poets writing today. Yeah, right. Note to David Lehman: This series needs a good kick in the pants."
5,best simpsons book ever!,I'v read all of the simpsons books in this series and this one was by far the best.
5,Great Little Manual for New Owners,"We recently acquired a new 7 week old Shih Tzu puppy. I purchased this book a few weeks before we brought the puppy home. It is chock-full of great facts, little tid-bits of interesting information about the breed and helpful tips in a variety of areas that include how to find a Shih Tzu, feeding, grooming, training and general care. It is well written, easy to understand and not overdone. The author also does not bombard the reader with her opinions, but rather makes suggestions on the topics.This book is a great ""Beginners Manual"" for first time Shih Tzu owners."
4,Shih Tzu Owner,The Shih Tzu Handbook is a great introduction to the breed. More people should read such books and follow the recommendations. The pictures are adorable too!
5,Great book on shih tzus,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very easy to read, as well as informative about the breed and care of the breed. The only disapointment was that on this site it says the book has information on breeding and it does not really have any other than the breed standard. The main reason I chose this book is because I was looking for information on breeding. I do not regret purchasing it, however!"
3,great recipes,I enjoyed the recipes in this book. I like just looking at cookbooks so enjoyed it and will make/try some of the recipes
5,"Marvelous, Fast Healthy Recipes to Dazzle The Palate","I'm giving this book (at THEIR request) to several friends and family members for a holiday gift. I've entertained friends, and myself, with the wonderful meals found in this book. I consider Lynn Fischer an author who can save us all from high-fat cooking with healthy, delicious foods."
4,FAT FREE - 225 DISHES,"Love the book- bought 8 more similar titles. Replaced all the cholesterol-laden, fat-dripping, high calorie cookbooks I used for years. Great CookBook. Easy - Tasty - Healthy, oh my! GREAT ADDITION TO MY FAT-FREE KITCHEN LIBRARY"
3,not as fabulous as I had hoped for,"Firstly, not every recipe has an image, indeed most don't, and I really like flipping through a cook book, letting my eye inspire me.These recipes felt too familiar, there isn't enough that is a clever twist or new here. I am actually getting more luck modifying more famous chefs recipes to a fat free variation, that using these. That's not to say it's a complete waste. If you don't have any fat free cook books at all, then this is a fine one to start, but if you have 2 or 3 already, then this won't bring anything new to the table."
1,14Dbi my foot,This hardly made any noticeable improvement in signal strength or connection quality as compared to the removeable antenna that came with the wireless card.
2,Not worth your time,"Was very excited to get this book. After all, Tolkien grew up reading MacDonald, the book seems to be pleasing most people, and the edition is handsome. But unfortunately I was very disappointed. The volume itself is very well done, and the story concept was great, but the execution was not very clever or memorable, and I found myself humoring the author a great deal, plodding through the book, waiting for something worth reading to happen. My two cents."
2,A major disappointment,"I am a big fan of Poul Anderson's, but this book was probably his worst. We never find out who Samael, the apparition, is, and wanting to know who he was was all that kept me going through this overly introspective story."
2,"Not great, but at least I finished it.","For some unknown reason I kept reading, but the characters were really awful stereotypes, and the plot obvious. The two stars are because despite all, I kept reading. Good for a flight, when you need something that doesn't require thinking."
3,Ok,"It doesn't catch every click if you are not careful, but otherwise it is a decent.It is not meant to be used hand held. You need to put on a solid surface for it to work correctly."
2,BAD -- LEARN NOTHING FROM IT,"Ok , before you buy a book look how many pages it is and how many reviews it has received . DO NOT LOOK AT NUMBER OF STARS . 4 stars with less than 10 reviews does not mean much . This book is useless . 128 pages and you won't learn a thing from it . Not to blame the author -- you cannot put down the game of chess in 128 pages . Seriously , no . I don't care how big a genius you are . Take my advice -- stay away from this and you won't be disappointed like me ."
4,"No exploding tanks, trucks, planes but still good.","For the life of me I cannot see why this movie got so many bad reviews. True, there were no exploding tanks or planes, but it was still good, a bit ambitious in trying to portray so many points of view, but it was far from confusing. Oh, well. At least, the Italians spoke Italian and the Germans spoke German (not English with a British accent)."
4,Sensitive WWII film where we can identify with all the characters,"Ari Taub's film shows World War II in the eyes of American, German and Italian soldiers all pitted against each other on the Gothic Line. One gets to feel compassion for all these young men who are in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have the Americans who have come to liberate Italy from its German occupiers. The Germans are faced with certain defeat but we get to meet some interesting and caring characters who in a peace time situation might become very close friends. The film does not have any really big battle scenes on special effects, so if anyone is expecting this, they will be disappointed but the realism and attention to detail and characters is really good.Mr. Taub finds a unique way to show the futility of war."
1,goofy,"goofy actors, goofy music. Should have been a good, well-acted storyline but failed miserably. Can't say anything nice about it. Save your money!!!!"
1,lousy,"From the description on Netflix, I was excited about this movie; it seemed to hold some promise. After 50 minutes or so, I had to turn it off. The music was out of place and corny. The acting was sub par. Was there a plot? If so, it wasn't evident. Very disappointing. I kept waiting for something more, but it never came (and I didn't want to waste any more of my time). Is it a comedy? Is it a parody? It's hard to take this movie seriously.Before renting, be sure to watch the trailer(s). To search for the trailer, look for ""the fallen 2004 trailer"". In my opinion, it's not worth a rental...and definitely not worth buying.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on ""Listmania! Lists""."
2,Waste of Money It's BAD,"I'm a WWII History buff collect Toy Soldiers, Movies & Books about WWII.I'm an old retired military with a little combat experience I am a fair judge of books & movies.This film rates as one of the worse I've ever viewed and there have been some bad ones made.What more could I say. It's BAD"
2,"Better than ""Saving Private Ryan""!","Just kidding! I don't understand why this film had 2 international awards. It tries hard to get the viewpoints of the Americans, Germans and Italians but only succeeded in telling the Italian version of WWII. Given the budget, I think I could make a better film."
2,ZOMBIE BOMB,"The best part of the movie are the short features of fake previews in the beginning of the movie. When the actors, writers, directors, producers are all the same person, one never takes the movie seriously.Dr. Stern experiments on a special education class. He makes them smart and then dead. The movie lacks the cleverness of the shorts in the beginning. Zombies do eat a baby in this one...taste just like veal. The movie is mostly hype and not worth a peek.F-bomb, sex talk."
2,Packable pillow,This product is not what I had hoped it would be. It does not pack up much smaller than it's original size. It's a rather small pillow to begin with and at best folds in half to pack up into the attached sack. We ended up buying the THermarest pillows which are just as small packed up but then expands to twice the size and is much more comfortable. The Columbia pillow is more like a neck roll than a pillow. I would not recommend this product.
4,Much Better Than a T-Shirt,For $10 this pillow is far superior to having to sleep on a rolled up T-shirt. For the price you cannot go wrong.
2,Sad to say...,"Generic rock n' roll. We've been hearing ""cruching chords"" as one admiring reviewer put it, for 30 years or more now. I understand why Hart would do this, is a common enough ploy for musicians who feel its time to get some of those ""dues"" back, but I would have preferred Hart stay with what he was good at."
1,terribly disappointing,"If you liked ANY of Alvin Youngblood Hart's other cd's, I can almost guarantee you will NOT like this one. It's garbage. It's a poor crossover/sellout effort. Thankfully though he went back to acoustic roots music with his most recent release. Pick up anything else by Alvin - his other three cd's are wonderful music. We'll just pretend this release never happened...."
2,Eichmann in my hands,"This book was unbelievable. A friend told me it was good enough to read out of school so i decided to try it. Wow. It was written really well, and it was also really interesting. One part was hysterical! I was laughing so hard, I had tears streaming out of my eyes. It's written above in amazons review. This book is a must read. Thanks Chav for the recc!"
5,A True Life Espionage Story Better than Fiction,"This is a true account of the hunting down and capture of the infamous Nazi. More thrilling and readable than any fictional work, Malkin does a wonderful job recalling this adventure in South America which occured over 40 years ago.Filled with humor, pathos, history, and adventure, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Nazi-hunting, the Holocaust, Israel, espionage, or undercover operations in general.This book was the basis for a TNT movie, starring Robert Duvall as Eichmann. I had the pleasure of seeing this movie, reading the book, and hearing Malkin speak in person within a short period of time. It is only a shame that, due to the Mossad gag order, we had to wait 30 years to hear this tale."
4,I could not put it down,"Malkin's book is nothing short of a masterpiece. His early life's story in and of itself is compelling beyond his accomplishments later on. I really enjoyed his telling of fighting in the hagannah and later in the '48 war against the Arab invasions.But the capture of Eichmann is the watershed moment in 20th century Jewish history that all should hold up as the defining characteristic of the Jewish people as a whole. We will not be the whipping boys of Europe or the world anymore. We will seek out our enemies wherever they are, regardless of the circumstances, and take them to be held up before justice.The courage Malkin and his compatriots is the story of us all."
4,Hard to Put Down,"I found this book hard to put down. Malkin gives very good personal & historical background of what it was like to grow up in Israel after most of his family moved there while he was young. I say ""most"" since some were exterminated in the Holocaust. That background information leads you into how he ended up in the ""profession"" that eventually put him face to face with the coldest mass murder that mankind has ever known. I look forward to reading other books about Eichmann and about Josef Mengele, and about their final fates."
4,review of Iron Man Armored Adventures,"This DVD is awesome. My son adores Ironman and this is very interesting and being that he is younger teen, holds younger childrens interest."
5,great series,"If there are any teen hero fans out there, this is the show for you! Granted, they didn't exactly follow the original story, but they had to make SOME adaptations in order to create a show for teens, not adults. And I think they did a very good job."
4,Ironboy?,Juvenile Ironman is pretty ok. Does a fair job walking the line between adult and kid entertainment. I looked forward to watching the next episode.
3,Partially Satisfied,"One of the discs in the Iron Man Adventures collection was scratched & skips.If I ever order another dvd or cd, I will make sure to only order new products."
2,didnt really like it,"So i baught this new sight, thought it was good at first but i was wrong.... the whole sight(all of the screws) came lose after couple of shots so i have to tighted them up agian. Another this is that the pin wasent that bright so i baught a light for it, the pin was much brighter now but the pendulum dosent work now, it shoots low.... looking for a new sight maybe G5's XR sight.... woundent recomend this to anyone else for the price..."
4,one thing leads to another,"this really is an amusing and delightful tale...dear lovers of Faery literature and Irish tales,... which starts with a simple incident that leads to another and another in a rather convoluted fashion, leading eventually to the Great God Pan himself and the ancient Gods of Eire. It had, for these elves at least, a wonderful and surprising ending that we hope in due time will come to pass.kyela,the silver elves"
3,"Interesting text, poor edition","I'm not here to comment on the validity of JS Mill's ideas. The book is certainly helpful for those studying philosophy or attempting to gain a better understanding of political tradition. However, this edition is very poor. The footnotes are mixed in with the body of the text, so there's no way to know where they end. The description on the back sounds like it was written by a young student, which makes me suspicious about the quality of the printing. The text is difficult to follow because of its arrangement on the page. The printers divide words whenever possible and use hyphens instead of dashes.My complaints may sound minor, but I have not seen problems like this anywhere else--certainly not from a company that calls itself an authority on ""classic books"" or advertises ""beautiful"" production. The low price is the only benefit."
2,Another not-so-great Kindle edition,"This Kindle book was clearly created from a text file and little, if any, editing or formatting was done for the Kindle.Paragraphs are fixed width, so unless you size your screen to the paragraphs, you will have lines breaking all over the place. Formatting is of the suggestive type found in text files; for example, underlining appears like _this_. No index and no links for the footnotes, so you will have to scan for the ends of the chapters to find them.It is not unreadable and not a terrible deal for 99 cents, but it would have taken less than 15 minutes of work to correct these annoyances."
2,"No wonder Nietzsche called Mill a ""blockhead""...","In the Introduction to ""On Liberty,"" Currin Shields, an English egghead, bemoans the fact that Mill's most ""famous"" essay is ""more talked about than read.""I'm surprised it is even talked about, and I am very much NOT surprised that hardly anyone reads it. Mill takes about a hundred and twenty pages to say what could be (and was) summed up in an epigram: People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else.Not only does Mill subject the reader to pages and pages of supererogatory writing, but his prose is the epitome of Victorian verbosity, with more modifiers, clauses, footnotes, and parentheticals than there are alcoholics in Butte, Montana. (And there are a LOT of alcoholics in Butte, Montana.)I guess if you're studying philosophy, you're gonna have to read this thing sooner or later...likewise if you're an autodidact."
1,No table of contents,"This edition is subtitled ""Optimized for Kindle"". I was therefore quite surprised that it lacked a table of contents. What does ""optimized"" mean in this context?"
3,Where liberalism went wrong...,"John Stuart Mill was a liberal's liberal or a socialist's socialist- ahead of his times (or just hanging on Karl Marx's coattail.) His utilitarian socialist philosophy was a real u-turn away from the classic liberalism preceeding his times. What is particularly disturbing is that this book is passed off by academia to represent classical liberalism. This book is good for its historical value and studying political theory, but don't be fooled into thinking 'On Liberty' is at all faithful or indicative of the classical liberal or libertarian philosophy on liberty.Get Liberalism in the Classic Tradition by Ludwig von Mises to understand true classical liberalism."
3,Disappointed in the case,"This was a gift for my daughter and the sunglasses did come as shown on the web. The case however was not even close to what was shown, so that was disappointing!"
2,What is so good about it?,"Brought the movie because I've read the reviews here, and I thought it would be really good. This movie disappointed me, I was watching it and ended up thinking ""What the hell this movie is trying to do?"". The plot is so simple: Jessica, a super-shy-lesbian-curious found a girlfriend on the ad, she loves her but she doesn't wanna have sex with her. In the end, she goes back to her co-worker which happens to be a guy. That's it! Wanna buy it? Up to you..."
2,"Worth renting, not buying","I rented this movie with my friend. We both found it funny and were ready to rush out and buy it....then we finished the movie and were ready to bring it back to the video store that night. Its a cute movie, but I would recomend stoping the movie right about the time they walk back to the wedding (you will know the part when you see it) after that its all down hill.Up until before the wedding its about 4 stars, but the ending made me rate it 2 stars"
2,O-o-o-o-o-okay,"This movie has all the ingredients to be witty, touching, and poignant, yet fails dismally across the board. KISSING JESSICA STEIN could have been and should have been a funny story about a single woman's sexual confusion and frustration in an inherently confused and frustrated world, but instead we witness Jennifer Westfeldt giggling and ad libbing well beyond mere annoyance as the insecure Jessica Stein. Heather Juergenesen, who co-wrote the script with Westfeldt, plays bisexual Helen Cooper with such ambivalence I felt she would have been more comfortable simply staying behind the typewriter.The story is contrived, the timing between the characters is off, and the ultimate demise of the relationship tacked on as a footnote ending is exasperating. KISSING JESSICA STEIN had potential, then squandered it via unimaginative, one-dimensional, stereotypical storytelling. Kind of like kissing a patch of drywall, but who would want to?"
2,Lesbian movie that's better suited for straight people.,"Yes, Kissing Jessica Stein is a funny, well-acted, and well-written movie. But if your expecting a good lesbian romantic comedy, you'll be disappointed.If you're straight, you'll love this film. If you're a lesbian, you're likely going to have mixed feelings about the movie.In the end, this movie sends a VERY important message to straight audiences: you can't choose your sexual orientation.It's disappointing that Hollywood can't produce a ""true"" lesbian film as good a Kissing Jessica Stein. (Those who watch a lot of lesbian films will know what I'm saying.) Why couldn't the writers just made Jessica Stein a lesbian????To sum up: it's a good movie that will leave most lesbians depressed in the end. This lesbian is ""Walking Out On Jessica Stein""!"
2,Another One Bites The Dust,"I saw this movie at an Outfest screening. Luckily my friend got the tickets and I didn't have to waste my money. This movie was another ... lesbian movie disappointment. I must say that I loved this movie at first. I thought that it was excellent... until about the last 5 to 10 minutes of the movie. The ending ruined the entire movie. Why is it that noone seems to be able to make even one lesbian movie where it ends happily?! If it weren't for the ending I would have gone to see this movie again and bought the DVD when it came out. However, because of the ending I never want to watch this movie again. It enraged me so much that I have been angry about it for the past 3 days! Hopefully now that I've vented I will get over it. If you are looking for a good lesbian movie, skip this one. If you watch the movie right until the end of the brother's wedding and then leave immediately, you will love it. Trust me, the ending ruins what could have been a wonderful movie."
2,making statements about making statements,"Ever seen GI Jane? When she tells the comander that she isn't there to make a statment and he says ""If you were just like everyone else I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about making statements""?? Well this DVD is a bit like that. In the comentary the women who plays Jessica talks about not trying to make statements about being lesbian or straight. This movie made me angry. Not because I'm so close minded that I can't handle people experimenting but because this movie was advertised as a lesbian film. It is not a lesbian romace. It is a movie about a straight women who experiments with a bisexual women. The focus is on Jessica and who she ends up with and not on Helen. I recomend this movie for straight couples or women as a ""chick flick."" However I do not recomend it to lesbians. It is not the same sex romance it appears to be."
4,Marinating in delight,"Writers Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt, taking their off-Broadway creation to the big silver screen, are the driving force behind this fun film. Their characters are real and realized, deep and complex, insightful and real. Kudos to these strong women for bringing to equally strong women to the screen.The movie is brave in that it doesn't rely on tired cliches to advance the plot. Even the ending avoids a traditional Hollywood happy ending, by giving us a pleasing, eye-opening complex one.It's a movie about relationships, being brave enough to take a risk, and feeling comfortable within yourself to love someone else. The fact that its two women is immaterial, the distinction doesn't matter. It's about living and loving in today's modern, complex world, and who cannot relate to that?"
2,spoiler ahead,"This was a pretty good movie, but it was not at all as advertised. It was labeled as romantic comedy. Comedy, yes. Romantic, no. It didn't have any good love scenes, and just when it seemed that everything was going really well, it ended with the couple breaking up with no hope of getting back together. What kind of romance is that?"
4,Funny and Intelligent...,"Very few gay/lesbian films are made for most moviegoers. This is one of those 'few' films. Brilliantly written, Stein is a wonderful exploration of self and sexuality with great performances and funny dialogue/situations. The entire film is directed with a compassion for humans whether you are male, female, gay or straight. There are scenes aplenty of uncomfortable situations and decisions that make you feel for the characters without having to totally relate to their plight. Written and starring Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, this film proves that they both have a very bright future in filmmaking. Directed by newcomer Charles Herman Wurmfeld, I highly reccommend this one! **** Stars."
5,Kissing Jessica Stein,"This movie is so hilarious... Outstandingly funny!!! Althoughthe story evolved around an ""unconventional"" type of love relationship, the actors (Heather & Jennifer) performance wereexcellent. They did the movie in very good taste. I love Tovah Feldshuh(Jessica's Mom) I think her acting was great."
5,"Go watch it, it's fun!","This is a movie that will hit home for oh so many singletons who know the scene too well and are searching for love in other, less explored, areas. Jessica takes a plunge and, for better or worse, she ends up with an unexpected result and a better, more profound, understanding of herself.In a way, the movie is a hymn to making your own mistakes instead of gaining wisdom from mistakes of others. But isn't that true that you get to know thyself much better through a first-hand experience? Well, Jessica does exactly that, and the result is something we all wish for - better understanding of thyself and the world around.On a negative side, the leading actress seemed to have either a speech impediment of some sort, or she was just poorly trained in the art of speech. Whatever it was, it made it difficult to understand her a few too many times.Overall, this is a movie for those with an open mind, conservatives will probably have hard time grasping certain points of the movie."
2,Miserable movie either way.,"This movie was, hands down, one of the worst I had ever seen. I don't particularly care that Jessica ends up going back to her het life in the end - face it, this does happen. Women DO experiment, and some decide that it isn't for them after all. It's a bit unreasonable to expect sexuality to remain within rigid borders.The problem with this movie was that it was a extremely off. The actresses were terrible, even if they were cute. The dialogue was so horribly timed that I kept feeling as thought I was watching a badly dubbed kungfu flick. I didn't even bother watching the end of it, and even I knew that she was going to go back to the guy in the end.The moral? People who write should stick to writing. People who act should stick to acting. Never the twain shall meet."
1,KISSING JESSICA STEIN,"Could not even play the disc and reason displayed on the dvd player is""Please check Region Code"""
2,needs a better actress,The storyline might have been interesting but the actresses in the movie just doesn't fit it. I think that they should have chosen a better looking celebrity. No offense but the actress who played as Jessica just doesn't have the kind of face that fits the character. I did not want to finish the whole movie because of this.
2,Male-bashing,"I just saw this movie, and it seems it was made to make straight men look like a-holes, but in a ""nice"" way. Every guy in this movie is either portrayed as angry, or neurotic and clueless about women. Furthermore, the men who are portrayed in a positive light are all gay. I mean, c'mon. I bet the directors and producers all hate men, even if they would not admit it openly. A straight, jewish, New York girl only runs into clueless, idiot straight guys, and as a result, has to turn to lesbianism for fullfillment. Please. Just another example of how much of the entertainment industry is run by women for women, even if its not openly expressed. I guess in a perfect Hollywood world, all the men would be gay and dickless, and talk all day about interior decorating and high art. Sorry, 2 stars for effort, but its all a subtle form of male-bashing. Womens rights? What about mens rights?"
1,Total garbage!!!,"It's funny because it's so intimate.'It's so intimate because I think people think like this.I think people think like this because it's so real.It's so real because the camera shakes, I've heard of Nobu, and I now think like this.I now think like this because I'm sexually dysfunctional.I'm sexually dysfunctional because the movie told me to be.......and I'm an idiot!'"
1,Dissing Jessica Stein,"This film, while cute and a celebration of the quirky (okay, neurotic), was a real disappointment. It is a mainstream Hollywood film masquerading as an indie film about lesbians. It is not raw nor is it a realistic depiction of lesbian relationships. For starters, both women at the opening of the film aren't even gay. They each decide to experiment with a same sex relationship, which fails miserably because whalla! Jessica Stein isn't really gay, and all she really needed was for her egocentric ex-boyfriend to notice her again. Oddly enough, she accomplishes this by having a relationship with a woman. ... It was a film with promise, which disappointed and insulted the lesbian community. This film reinforces the hetero belief that being gay is centered upon who you sleep with, and not the connections made with that person."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If the idea of a Jewish LGBT romantic comedy appeals to you, then this film's for you; in all sincerity though, Kissing Jessica Stein is a bold movie whose every turn is not defined by the whim of a screenplay, and whose ending is neither manufactured nor necessarily heart-warming and all the better because of it."
3,Hilarious movie with a very lame ending!,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie a lot! It was very funny, witty and at times emotional.. I think I watched it three times in the two days that I own it... It's just the ending... That had to be the worst 7 minutes of cinema ever! Everytime I watch this movie from now on I will not be watching the ending. If it wasn't for the ending, this would be a four-star movie. Also, I would like to thank this movie for introducing me to Rilke..."
3,It's okay,"I bought this out of curiosity. This movie felt a little ""safe"" to me. It's cute. Yes it has it's funny moments but, I dunno, I just felt nothing after I watched. It really didn't do anything for me. I am not mad though. I just think I'll try to give it to someone else."
4,Great -- Refrigeration helps,"Great product. I bought a box that did not live up to its expiration date, but chilling the ones that I do not need out works just fine. Will order again."
3,Nice,Just be careful because it's a heavy box! I bought it as a gift and had to travel by plane with it.
3,Not .5 oz container / Product Description is misleading,"I purchased this product from this specific supplier thinking that based upon the product description ""Mini Moo's Half and Half, .5 oz, 192/Carton"" they were the larger creamer containers, hence better value. Turns out they are the standard 9/32 fluid oz containers and not a larger .5 oz container, so while the product is fine the description is wrong and misleading."
3,mini-moos,"the product is as expected. we use them in our travel kit and at home. however the expiration date on the box was only 60 days from purchase, so we will never use them all up before the expire. i would buy this product again if i can confirm the expiration date and not waste 100 of them."
2,Smelly Box,"Total disaster. I ordered two boxes of Land O' Lakes creamers and both boxes contained many erupted creamers. Since I live at an APO address, it was not worth the postage to send the creamers back. I ended up washing the survivors in a strainer and used them. I guess you can imaging the foul smell. Poor packaging."
1,Item Recieved is Different then What is Advertised.,"The item for sale is advertised as Land O' Lakes Traditional Half n' Half Creamers, and I recieved Land O' Lakes Mini Moos with the experation of less than 2 months. I actually paid a little more to order from this company to avoid getting mini moos. The Traditional is says it has no preservatives and needs no refrigeration because it's Ultra-pasteurized. The Mini Moos contain: sodium citrate, datem, tetra sodium pyrophosphate, carrageenan."
3,Reads like a sales brochure.,The book seems directed at those considering an installation or upgrade. It lacks detailed information on any of the services that come in the box. It is not the detailed CNE's desktop reference that I was looking for. The book give little more information than the online documentation CD from Novell.
4,A fun read (just ignore the cheesy title),"I'm not too familiar with the gothic romance genre, which is pretty much looked down upon by snooty readers, but if they are all written like Barbara Michaels I'm all for them. This book worked for me. It is witty, well-paced, has a clever plot, and most importantly, is believable notwithstanding its batty premise of a modern-day witches' coven deep in Upper Middle-Class America. A reader looking for ""horror"" is bound to be disappointed, because Ms Michaels is not out to terrorise her readers or scare them silly. Which is fine with me, because I prefer stories which are moved by real human agents who face up to challenges and grasp their destinies, rather than tales popoulated by terrified pawns of the supernatural. An easy and thoroughly enjoyable read. Not too much stress on the little grey cells, but neither are we required to suspend our disbelief."
4,My first Barbara Michaels and still one of my favorites,"Made me a believer that whether witchcraft is real or not, the people who believe in it can be pretty scary. It's one book I've reread several times."
4,Compelling Story!,"Kenneth Kerns managed to pull off a very strong debut novel in ""Reunion at University Avenue."" The character of Mike Adams is compelling, as is the story he weaves.Although the novel has its cliches (including a flirtatious and sexy blonde who seems to fall for Mike and becomes a suspect in the attacks), the story is a solid romp through a world where student government is taken with dead seriousness.The backdrop of adventure, entwined with excerpts from Mike's best-selling novel to provide backstory, is a solid read and I highly recommend it. The only other real problem with the work is editing errors (a lot of accidental movement to present tense from past), but since this was self-published, I'm not holding that against Kerns.Looking forward to more this from this author!"
2,"Hallie and Billy Are Good, But The Movie Needs Help!","Monster's Ball is a very intense movie. It garnished Hallie Berry with her Academy Award and I must admit she did a fantastic job, however this movie is not something I would see again. The performances are good and even Peter Boyle is a standout. Hallie tries hard and performs very well.Billy Bob Thorton is also a deep performer in this piece. Coupled with a really weird town and a really backwards thinking community - this movie shows the harsh realities of prejudice, love, hate and rivalry among a father who doesn't love his son and a son who loves his father.I wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart and it has a real depressing theme - even Hallie's own child gets a strange twist. Overall the DVD doesn't have a lot of extra features but it does have few trailers of some better films. I was disappointed in this and wasn't quite expecting what I saw. I rented it because this is not a film I would buy."
2,not believable,"how could a poor black woman (halle berry) fall in love with a racist corrections officer (billy bob thornton) who took part in the execution of her husband (p. diddy)? it is hard to believe hollywood would present this ...as a sentimental romance. just think, halle berry won an oscar for this."
1,Oscar for Halle??,"It's becoming so obvious that the Oscars are political. Totally Political. I believe Halle Berry is a very talented actress and have enjoyed her performances in the past but this film left me empty. The story, while dealing with serious subject matter, was comrpomised with a thin thin story. Billy Bob Tornton merely showed up, Halle Berry was forced to overact to make up for a zero character and the explicit yet boring sex scene was a cheap ploy to get audiences into the theaters. Quite simply, a waste of time for the audience and an Oscar for Halle Berry in a performance that should be an embarrassment."
1,Not Worth It,"There were moments where this film interested me, but otherwise I found myself wondering why Halle got an Oscar for this role, or more importantaly-- why this film was so acclaimed. After watching the credits role I decided it was because of the sex scene; ""taboo"" lust, if you will. The plot was weak and the ending left me hanging."
1,The most unintentionally funny movie of the year!,"While watching this I was reminded of a conversation I had with a friend of mine. He had watched a horrible made for TV movie in which the dramatic climax was a wheelchair bound man screaming while being pushed into a swimming pool.Both movies try to make you feel for their characters and end up failing horribly. In the scene where Halle Berry vents her frustrations by abusing her son. She yells at him about his obesity and tells him not to eat any more candy. When she leaves the room the boy removes a candy bar from under a pillow. I broke out laughing, not at the action, but at the fact that this was the movie that roger ebert picked as the best film of the year. In any other movie that WOULD have been a joke.The other flaw of the movie is that it uses racial tension as a theme, but does nothing with it of any significants, the movie would have been the same if Berry's character was white."
3,Sometimes you have to...,"respond. Halle Berry gave her best performance in this, but it was still nowhere near Oscar material. She's just an average actress. If the person who said she's a better actress than Katherine Hepburn was truly believes that, they really shouldn't watch any more films, because they have absolutely no idea what the word ""acting"" means. I guess Britney Spears is a better singer than Leontyne Price, too, huh? But then what can you expect from someone who called Justin Timberlake's CD a ""classic""?"
4,Highly Recommended,"A very interesting movie. This drama centers around a prison guard who has an affair with the wife of the man he executed in the electric chair, which he tries to keep a secret from her, even as they both find themselves falling in love. As usual Billy Bob Thornton is damned good, as is Heath Ledger as his fellow guard (he also has one of the shortest sex scenes in screen history when he visits a hooker. Ol' Billy Bob lasts a bit longer); but Halle Berry gives her best performance to date (she truly deserved her Oscar), as does rapper Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs as her condemned husband (why wasn't he nominated for an Oscar?). Not one, but four great performances add to this movie's depth and humanity as well as its scenes of conflict and immorality. Well worth checking out."
3,Monster's Ball - Take One,"It was OK. There were racial slurs against blacks in it and abuse, mental and physical in this movie. Halle Berry played a strong but abusive mother, who treated her kid like he was an evil step child half the time. Billy Bob Thorton lived an empty life and was the cause of his son's death.With the guilt of that, and Halle's son dying, they both created a comfort space for each other. They talked, related a bit and had sex (it was Halle's idea).The story drags on in parts though because you see Billy driving his car to certain destinations and it takes forever. Towards the end I was wishing that the movie would end. It did.3.2 stars.end note: Is this the kind of movie you can watch more than once? Not in my opinion, no."
2,Schizoid,"This movie has three thing going for it: it's cinematography, its moody soundtrack (which mostly worked well with the visuals) and that interestingly-shot sex scene. Otherwise, the characters and plot were frankly laughable. As a character-driven film, my DVD player has more character. It was really just style over substance, which wouldn't have been as bad if the film didn't take itself so seriously."
2,A Dissapointment,"This movie was one that I had been waiting to see. I should have waited longer. Halle Berry was good -- but not good enough for an oscar for sure. Just because she is in a race related drama, breaks down when her son dies, and has at least a 5 minute soft-core porn scene with Billy Bob doesn't make the role deserving of best actress. Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom) and Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge) were both more deserving. Overall, I don't think the movie served a point. I have seen plenty of race-related dramas -- this one taught me nothing I didn't know already. Seeing it just made me dissapointed in Halle Berry (and her need for some raunchy scenes) and the oscars in general."
4,Very good flick,Halle Berry's performance in Monster Ball was excellent. She proved to everyone that she has more than good looks.
4,That sound you hear is the glass ceiling shattering...,"hail, hail, halle, on her magnificent accomplishment, on the being the first black actress in the 74 year history of the oscars to win best actress. and this performance is definately a 360 from anything she has done in her 11 years in hollywood. in fact, one who watches this film may do a double take to see if it is really her, that she was capable of conveying such emotion and depth. the interracial romance with billy bob thornton is daring, to say the least. interracial relationships are always controversial, an interracial relationship set down south is like pouring gasoline on a campfire. seems like over the past year hollywood has become more open minded about making interracial movies. i have seen 3 in the past year ( save the last dance, crazy/beautiful, and ""O"".) halle's and denzel's triumph will no doubt inspire other minority actors and artists to raise their talents a notch, to bring out the best in their work..."
3,"It's Alright, I Guess","I have mixed feelings about this movie. The movie was ok and Halle's acting was good, but she didn't deserve to win Best Actress and its ashame that she became the first black woman to win an award for that role. My opinion is Angela Bassett should have won for What Love Got To Do With It. Most people I know who have seen this movie more than twice, saw it because of the ""love"" scenes. I also find it hard to believe that a bigot can change his mind about black people in one night. Also what period was this movie base from? The 50's or the 90's. Its hard to figure out. Also I could tell that a man from Europe directed this movie. That's not a diss, but an admiration for their view on race and women of color. See it once and then let it go."
3,Lucky Actress,What a coexistence that Halle Berry gets the Academy Award the same year Denzel and Sidney are honored. She can also be glad it was a weak category.
1,I would have given it ZERO stars but that wasnt an option,"This movie was horrible! A Grammy should NOT have been awarded for this movie... I have my theory on the Grammy that was given to both Halle and Denzel.. But I will say this, Denzel is a wonderful actor and did a great job in Training Day and should have been given a Grammy way BEFORE Training Day!!... The sex scene may have been a vital part of the movie but was not needed to that degree. The acting was horrible, and I am so glad I was able to sell my DVD back to the store!......"
2,Not Impressed,"I was not impressed, I was really excited to see the oscar winning performance of miss berry, but I didnt think she deserved to win the oscar. It shouldve gone to Nicole for Moulin Rouge. This movie was slow and at times very dull and boring. The drama wasnt that dramatic and the love sceens seemed like something you would see on showtime late at night. I only give it 2 stars for the actors performances."
2,Depressing,"Good acting, but very depressing to me. Need to watch ""Sleepless in Seattle"" to cancel it out."
1,OSCAR MATERIAL -- I THINK NOT....,"Although the story was griping at times -- Halle Barry's performace was not worthy of an Oscar. The film would have been just as interesting without all the ""skin"". Way, way too much...."
1,One difficult movie to watch,"I rented this movie after the Academy Awards because I was curious to see Hally Berry's performance. Needless to say, the content of this movie was so difficult to watch, I had to turn it off. That's not to say that the acting was bad, but overall the story was dreadful.One of the worst parts of this movie was when Hally Berry's character catches her son eating and stuffing the food wrappers in the cushions of the couch, and then screams at him because of his weight and drags him to the bathroom where she forces him onto the scale, all the while telling him how fat he is.That is a horrible way to treat anyone, especially a child, and it was after that scene that I turned it off. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, for any reason."
2,"great actors,in an unbeleivable situation..................","suspend your beleif,there no way in hell these two characters would cross paths romantically.not only that,but i despise the main characters,there has to be at least someone you like in a movie?!?!!?but in this there's none,halle berry an annoying selfish person,billy bob's a racial redneck jerk,an peter boyle wow what a lunkheaded character he is.i hated this movie,thumbs way from me"
1,"Boring, BORing, BORING","I got this because Halle Berry won Best Actress, not sure how she did this after watching it. I wanted to turn it off at least six times waiting for some action.... It took me two nights to get through it. The dialogue was extremely slow, long drawn out scenes... I'd rather watch golf or grass grow... I will give this DVD away..... yuck!!!!!!"
3,Monster's Ball -- well done but very dark story,"This movie doesn't bring a ""feel good"" feeling to the front. It focuses on the darker side of human nature...beginning with an execution, along with suicide, a hit-and-run murder, and an unlikely romance.In the same way that comedians exaggerate features of people, this movie exaggerates the darkness that exists in people.Berry and Thornton do a good job acting in this, and it is engrossing albeit an ugly movie. It fails in its realism with just plain too many bad things happening to its characters. If you want to see people screw up their lives and who are generally much worse off, a definate must see."
2,letdown much?,"this movie has the plot and content of your average porn flick, only with a few big name celebs thrown in, short and depressing, halle is mediocre that best actress award is controversial, pdiddy is surprisingly very good, and Heath is by far the best actor in the movie (as he is in every movie) but he's not around for long so don't buy this just to see him like i did, cause all you'll get out of it from this film is a boner"
2,a let down,"I got this movie because of the award nominations and was disappointed. Halle Berry gets naked and lowers her acting standards, Billy Bob acts as himself, and Sean Puffy Combs actually does a better job than both of them. It could have been an interesting story, but too raunchy. Also, am I the only one who thought Leticia killed her fat son by throwing him in front of the car?? Just a thought."
2,Overrated and overhyped,"Halle Berry is a beautiful woman and a good actress, but she didn't deserve an Oscar for this one. Billy Bob Thornton, alas, lacks both good looks and acting talent. But they are not what's really wrong with this depressing piece of cinema. (What is good is Peter Boyle as Billy Bob's dad, more of a Monster than Boyle's best known role.)Where did the idea originate that excessively long scenes of simulated sex are entertaining? Especially when punctuated with all sorts of morbid violence. I suppose this is ""realism."" Give me escapism any time. Speaking of which, Berry's orgasms are no where near as well done as Meg Ryan's in ""When Harry Met Sally.""And neither Berry's nor Thornton's characters were consistent. An altogether unpleasant film. As it happens I had just watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a few nights earlier...similar subject matter, considerably better handled."
1,It finally dawned on me why Halle Berry got the Oscar!,"Anybody who could pretend to be, ahem, aroused by Billy Bob Thornton is definitely an Oscar-worthy actress."
2,Dissapointinggggggg!,"I luv halle berry, infact, she's one of my favourite actors. In this film her character is more than convincing.However, I just think the film drags and hasn't got a real climax or that 'something' in a film that makes you have some kinda deep reaction that lasts for about 3 scenes. the deathrow scene and the sex scene are reaction-jerkers, but that reaction only lasts for a little while cos of the bland scenes to follow. I can't even be bothered to wrtite this review...infact, i'm boring myself so i'm gonna wrap it up.This film was borrrring..snorrrrrrrr!Ps. the fat boy's the star of this movie!"
3,Disappointing,"If you are buying this movie to see Heath Ledger, don't bother. He isn't in it very much. You will be highly disappointed. The same with Halle Berry. Even though she won an academy award for her part, she really isn't in it that much either. Even though Heath and Halle did their parts well, the movie as a whole, was just okay. It isn't something I would care to see more than once."
2,Halle Berry and Puff Diddy Daddy at their... best?,This was not a bad movie but I must say that Halle Berry and Puff Diddy Daddy proved that you don't have to have talent as an actor to be in a movie these days. Puffy? I can understand him stinking the joint up but Halle Berry? Halle Berry? I mean how she won an Oscar for this soft core porn scene is beyond me. She is not a very good actor and she proved it in this film.You might want to see this movie once but that is only because Billy Bob Thornton is a good actor. But I wouldn't recommend it as something that I would want to see again. Give Halle and Oscar? Give me a break.
2,Highly Overrated,"Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is a prison guard. He works with his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger) and lives at home with his racist father, Buck (Peter Boyle). Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs) has just been executed and a horrible tragedy has happened at home. Now, Hank has just met Leticia (Halle Berry), a young black woman struggling to make ends meet and they quickly fall in love to ease each other's pains. If only he knew that Leticia is Musgrove's widow...Halle Berry gives a good, credible performance but it is no way worth an Oscar or a nomination. The sex in the movie was unnecessary and it seemed that it was only added for filler."
1,This won an Oscar?,"This terrible and trashy story won an Oscar? I have one thing to say to those who wont to see it-hold on to your stomachs!If you want to see graphic suicides, unecessary violece and cruelty, subpar acting, unappealing characters, a story filled with holes, pornographic sex scenes, etc. ad nauseum, then go and see ths. ..."
1,Not even fitting as a Xmas tree ornament,Truly a waste of film. I scratched my chin when she won an oscar... can't imagine spending money on this pointless film.Awful.
1,Nothing more than SOFT PORN,"I can't imagine why Halle Berry won an Oscar for this one, other than the fact that she got naked. I think it was repulsive. I found the sex scenes to be very vulgar. I had heard that it was a good movie - by all the reviews that I had seen, so I rented the movie and my wife and I proceeded to put in our popcorn, and settle in for a little bit of ""Friday Night"" movie watching. I was embarrassed to let my wife watch this with me - and was in the ""dog house"" for weeks to come, after watching this flick. Who in the WORLD are these ""critics"" that said this was a GREAT FLICK?I am confused. Young women stripping down and exploiting themselves for CASH - while calling it ""acting"". Isn't that what PORN is for?Halle - Have some class girl."
1,"Horrible, boring, sucked really bad",This was sooooo boring. Script was terrible. I waited for something to happen that never did. Don't waist your time.
5,Best Movie Of 2001 and The Best Movie Of The Decade,"Marc Froster's Monster's Ball is the best movie I have seen in the last decade. This movie is brillent and some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. Halle Berry's performance is the best I have seen since Marlon Brando In Last Tango In Paris and Billy Bob Thornton is simply amazing. As far as the rest of the cast there performances to are brillent Sean Combs,Peter Boyle, Kieth Ledger, and everybody else I forgot to mention there's to is brillent. This is going by my other film that is Equely good The War Zone. This film is not for childern This is a very adult movie and is for adults only. This Movie Is one word WOW.Warning: This Film Is Rated R For an Extremely Long Explist Sex Scene,Strong Violence,Nudity,Strong Sexuality, and Strong Language."
5,"Movie is Briliant, however people don't change that quickly","The movie is briliant in many aspects, alas the transformation of the racist bully is so quick and dramatic that it doesn't appear to be realistic. However since I might be wrong, and since it so realistic in so many other aspects I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt and its 5 stars"
5,Very misunderstood film,"It's a real shame that people will only focus on Halle's nude scene, the interracial relationship, or the death penalty issue. Despite all these qualities of the movie, the movie really deals with two people that need each other, not out of love, but more out of necessity. Though they have nothing in common, they are together to essentially console each other. I really thought Halle was outstanding and this is best acting I have seen her in. Billy Bob is always quality (check out A Simple Plan). Great supporting cast (including P Diddy) as well."
2,Not sure why they were nominated let alone winners,"Although the acting in this film is good, it's certianly not Oscar worthy, however none of the films nominated this year were. Monsters Ball is a movie about prejudice and sex, that's pretty much it. Aside from the sex, you will probably find this film to be rather slow, offensive, not just the sex but the prejudice content and overly depressing. Apparently hollywood forgot when they made this film that movies are meant to entertaiin and people to enjoy, not want to go to bed and not get out for weeks because they are so depressed afterwords.If watching depressing movies that move at the pace of molassas is your thing, then by all means get this one and watch it, otherwise be advised this movie is really not good, and as it relates to the mass hype, if you listened to that you are going to be thorougly dissappointed!"
