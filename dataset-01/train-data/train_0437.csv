2,Eek! How Boring!,"I have many books covering the making of movies and I have quite a few Art of Books. This has to be one of the most boring I have seen.The book primarily focus on the concept art that made the cut( rather than the art that didn't, like in the Art of Star Wars series) which leaves you feeling a little empty. Why see the final product when you can buy one of the Official movie books with stunning colour pictures?Pencil drawings, final clay models, and costume designs make up the majority of this book. However, again, it is only the final designs that make the cut.Take my advice and put the money into the Art of Attack of the Clones; much more exciting and better value for money."
5,"Finally, a fit!","Pumping can be mysterious when you first start. Medela pumps come with the standard 24mm flanges, but that size doesn't fit all. Oddly, there's no specific way to tell if that flange is too big (too small is easy to tell). You can pump in front of a lactation consultant for input on size. If there is a lot of space on the sides of the nipple when you begin pumping, if pumping pulls a good portion of the aerola into the flange, and if pumping hurts, then you probably need the smaller size. This 21 mm flange made pumping possible for me."
5,Amazing!,"No more sore nipples! This product is great, they fit right on my medela breast shield base with no issues."
5,Breastshields that fit!,This is the third set of breastshields that I have bought. The others have all been too big. I was worried that since I ordered them online that it would take forever to get here and I was currently breastfeeding and pumping at work. However these came in so fast and they were perfect. They came packaged and brand new. Great product! I only use Medela for all of my breastfeeding needs.
4,it works,"well even the 21mm is still larger than expected, but its better than the 24mm. durable and works like it should."
3,No difference,"I went with the smallest one, which was only 2mm narrower that the standard. I do not notice a difference in the pumping or anything, other than the fact that it's shorter. Maybe that is because I have ""flat"" nipples. They work fine, but it was not a necessary purchase. Personally, I would recommend people stick with the standard."
4,fast,"my wife loves it. Ordered it....and arrive in a nice packaging, without any delays.Had 2 pieces inside, which helps so that we can wash one and let it dry while using the other."
5,Glad I purchased them.,"Best thing is that nipples don't get sore anymore, like when I was using the standard size. Getting the proper size breast shield matters and make a difference."
2,Went through 3 different size shields,"I had major trouble breastfeeding. I bought all three sized shields, trying to figure out which one would work for me. I bought this before I saw the lactation consultant, after reading the Medela specifications on how the shield should fit. I showed this to the lactation consultant and she said that this would be too small for me. And it was. It did fit with room around my nipple, but I found that the large shield helped me pump more milk. I think that the medela diagram is a little misleading, because when you pump the nipple expands, so I would reconmend going up a size, not down."
5,Jumped on this too quick,"My wife hasn't actually used this product. We thought she needed this size for her breast pump, but it turns out the documentation we had was incorrect (in the picture) and she needed the larger size. Therefore, I don't know how to rate this exact product, but she does like her Medela breast pump overall."
2,Not much different from the 24mm,"I ordered these after a few weeks of pumping and finding that my breasts were sore after each session. After reading the reviews I had high hopes that this would resolve the issue, as it is a result of my breast tissue rubbing against the sides of the shield. Unfortunately, the 21mm is only SLIGHTLY smaller than the medium and barely made a difference at all. The only thing that I do notice is less leaking from my right side. My breasts still rub against the side of the shield--wishing Medela made an XS!"
2,Not a stand alone product,"I completely did not realize that I would not be able to use this product without also buying the connectors. The breastshields that I had were all one piece, so I expected that these would be as well. When they arrived, I realized I could not use them without purchasing another product, so I went ahead and tried the medium sized breast shields that I had. It turned out that they fit just fine, even though the images on the box had suggested otherwise. Breast pumps are already very confusing products, please try to be more clear on what it is you are selling and how it interacts with other parts."
5,Perfect fit,Shipped fast and was just what we needed. A getting a good fit is a must for comfort and production.
5,"This helped my wife, couldn't find these at stores locally.","They didn't seem to sell this size at any local stores, so I ordered it online for my wife. This made pumping more comfortable for her since it fit better. She is happy with them. Not a whole lot else to say... we probably just needed one not 2, but I guess there is an extra in case one ever gets lost or damaged somehow."
5,My life saver,"I have very small size boobs. the regular breastshields that came with the pump are way too big. i asked a lactation consultant and she was pretty sure that i should buy a bigger size. I did and what a mistake and what a waste of money.So glad that i found this 21mm on amazon. i could not find them in local stores at all.for a pumping mom who struggled so badly with the pump and was so desparate with the low production and sore nipples, this product is absolutely a life saver!!!!"
4,Worth a try,"These didn't work for me, but they are cheap enough that it was worth a try to find a better fit. I stuck with the standard size."
3,Barely fits the connector,The breastshield is as advertised but it barely fits with my Medela PIS Advanced connector. You really have to shove the two parts together and in doing so I'm afraid of breaking the connector over time. I question whether this is really made by Medela or not given the fit.
3,Too bad they don't make this size in SoftFit,"These are the perfect size for me, but they are so uncomfortable. Wish Medela would make these in a SoftFit style."
1,breast shield,Not as pictured. The neck of shield is really short. You can use it but need to fit it on the connector exactly no leeway.
3,shorter than the ones that came w/ my harmony model originally,shorter than the ones that came w/ my harmony model originally. Not sure if that is ok or if it's an oops.
1,disappointing,"I thought, from what I read, that smaller flanges would be more comfortable and more effective. I was wrong! my mediums, although a bit too big, are soft and much more comfortable than these hard things! What a waste of money!"
5,"A ""Regular People"" Review","Mahler, by way of his symphonies has become my favorite non-operatic composer. This disc is great, it did take me a few listenings to really start to enjoy it, but the experience is greater every time. One may want to start with Mahlers 2'nd but you won't go wrong with this either."
2,"Good concept, bad exceution","Eyes of the Werewolf is a grade Z horror film. DOn't get me wrong, I love these type of movies. I just wish the filmmakers would have spent a little more time in production. It fair viewing but nothing spectacular. One of the filmmakers would go on to make a very good werewolf film ""Werewolf in a Women's PRison."""
2,shot on videotape....in 3-D!,"This is an amatuer production shot on videotape, but is slightly more interesting in that it was made in 3-D. Some VHS and DVD versions do contain this version, which requires LCD shutter glasses. The 3-D version is often bundled with similar films along with the glasses and driver box. I've seen worse DTV stuff...."
1,This movie is no good - sorry,"I am sorry I bought this movie and watched it and it totally sucked. Didn't like it one bit. This movie just did not do it for me and I am really into horror movies, if you don't have to buy it I wouldn't."
2,"this is a flat 2-D version of a 3-D movie, so skip it.","EYES OF THE WEREWOLF is available on VHS in the original 3-D format, so why is the DVD flat only? The movie is pretty good for amateur stuff, but they cheated by using some flat 2-D insert closeups of the wolf make-up, which really stand out as 99% of the film is 3-D."
4,Totally hilarious and worth the few dollars,"This book not only gives you some good recipies, but comes complete with a really good side-line commentary that reads well and keeps you laughing. Pictures included of the people and places referenced to give you an idea of those mentioned. Worth the read sitting next to a pool or in front of a fire place, beyond the good mixtures of drinks to share with your friends. I ordered this book looking up the name ""Donna Sue"" after someone I know... this was the first thing on the screen. We laughed, so i ordered it."
1,Disappointing Book,"I had high hopes for this book but found it a disappointment and wish I had just read my Bible instead. The concepts are sound, but there is a smug tone to the anecdotes that bothers me. There is an over-emphasis on telling tales of church conflict and Christians being unkind to one another. Ironically, the author devotes a lot of space to criticizing critical people. My advice is to skip this book and read the Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament instead."
5,Fabulous Read!,I read it from beginning to end without stopping. My copy is still making the rounds among my friends. You won't be sorry.
4,Late Bloomers,"What a great compilation of individual women's experiences about finding out who they really are qnd what they choose to do about it. Late Bloomers is a sound support for older women in transition and possibly an eye opener for women who ""knew"" from the begining."
3,Just 'ok',"The beginning of this work really started to speak to me and my experience with this unique situation. Then like most of these works, for the remainder, it presented only chapters of 'finding her' stories and that was it. ...guess I was hopeful I was finally going read a work that would have a research perspective I could identify with. Check it out nonetheless. The 'finding her' stories are ok."
1,Peppermints in the Parlor 2.0 with minor changes,"This book would have been wonderful if I had read it without reading the first book, but it was pretty much peppermints in the parlor written again with a different title. I loved Peppermints in the Parlor and it is one of my favorite books from elementary school but the sequel just doesn't cut it.[...]"
1,This is not an authorized version!,"The reason why this book seems so dull and lifeless is that Remarque never intended to publish this version. Remarque was in the habit of completely rewriting his manuscripts several times over; this is how most of his books evolved. At his death several manuscript versions of ""Shadows in Paradise"" existed, but the last one was unfinished, ending halfway in chapter 21. His widow, Paulette Goddard-Remarque and the German publisher Droemer-Knaur tried to make a fast dollar and deliberately chose one of the older manuscript versions for publication.Marc W. Kuester studied the manuscripts from the author's estate and was able to provide evidence that the published version had been discarded by Remarque and that he was rewriting the novel with a new concept when he died. The claim made by Goddard and executor Felix Guggenheim that the printed version was the ultimate one is a lie."
4,Unbelievable but true,There are so many interesting pieces of information in this book that they make the read worth it. The literary quality is not high but the text does not get in the way of the contents. It begins with day-by-day accounts of guerilla warfare in the jungle but the at the end gives more of an overview of events. Read and be baffled by a man that lived through disease and dangers beyond your imagination.
5,War historian,"Having been born in Malaysia this book was immediately attractive to me. I was impressed by Colonel Chapman's attention to detail and at the same time, successfully managing to curb the ""typical"" authors' poetic licence to embelish certain aspects of the story to entice readers' interest. The story is fast and accurate with black and white photographs providing additional interest and serves to engage the reader. An excellent book for people who appreciate non-fictional war stories from a historical perspective. Highly recommended."
3,Not enough action,"I'd read excerpts of The Jungle is Neutral back in high school decades ago and when it came to mind recently I decided to order a used copy from Amazon.com. While it was very well written with a lot of detail concerning activities of the guerrilla underground during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia, there simply wasn't enough action for me so that's the reason for the 3 stars."
2,The Jungle is Neutral,"A good read. This book however was advertized as ""Hardcover"" and came as a paperback, very yellowed."
3,Good Movie,"Not Takashi Miike's best but still a solid movie. Good pacing, lots of action and some gore. Some animated sequences which can be bring the movie down a little. Rent it if you can find it."
4,Beautiful Love Story...,"As my second favorite Takashi Miike film to date, it's quite a sweet love story amongst gratuitous violence and bizarre characters. In Japanese, Portuguese and Chinese, this is an ultra cool movie with a myriad of wierd Miike characters, drugs, guns and blood. You get the picture if you like the Miike, which I do...contains a ping pong scene which you won't soon forget. Remember playas, this is Takashi Miike here...my homie..."
2,When good directors make bad movies,"I caught this movie on cable after seeing ""Audition"" (which I liked) in the theatre. That Miike is a gifted director, pipin- full of potential, there can be no doubt. Nice sets, nice camera-work, nice techinical work. But there can also be no doubt that this movie is so full of hookum as to make the ghosts of Japanese screenwriters past weep. As eye candy, the movie does have a certain charm. As anything else, pass. The characters are set pieces with dialogue; the plot has the clairity of pea soup. The only reason I gave it two stars is that any Japanese movie featuring a Brazillian element offers interest, sociologically speaking. I'm curious to see if there will be more entries into the Japanese-Brazillian catagory, given the current state of Japanese immigration.My advice: Go rent (or buy) ""Tears of the Black Tiger."" It's Thai, not Japanese, but that (gory) action movie has the heart that this movie lacks."
1,Not Miike's Best,"Don't bother with this piece of trash. At least rent before you buy. I'm a great fan of Director Miike's work, but he makes so many films that some just turn out to be garbage.If you want to see some good Miike films see Ichi the Killer (if you can stomach it), Audition, Dead or Alive, The Happiness of the Katakuris (my favorite heart-warming, zombie, musical comedy!), Visitor Q (very, very odd and perverse), even Fudo ... anything but this one!I'm surprised this movie has recieved so many rave reviews on this site. I mean no offence to other reviewers, but my humble opinion is don't take this movie as an example of Miike's best work. Read a review anywhere else and you'll see what I mean.The Matrix - style cockfight scene is very funny, though."
3,Brutal violence and love...,"City of Lost Children is a Japanese contemporary version of Bonnie and Clyde. Kei is about to be deported, but her boyfriend Mario steps in between the law and rescues her in order for them to set sail for freedom. In order to reach freedom they need to buy a couple of very expensive tickets through a crook who has specialized in helping criminals leave the country. Thus, Kei and Mario attempt to rob the mafia in order to get the money for the trip. However, somehow they end up with the Yakuza's cocaine instead and they have to run from the law as well as the crime element. City of Lost Souls is a changing story that jumps everywhere and at times does not make sense at all. Nevertheless, the cinematography is magnificent, which adds some spice to the overall experience."
2,City of Lost Souls,I just picked up this movie today and it took everything that I could muster not to pull it out of the DVD player. I am a big fan of Japanese and Chinese blood operas but this movie is truly horrible. The acting was horrid. The only reason that I gave the movie 2 stars is because the movie had a decent story line. I recomend spending your money on something else.
2,Violently Expressed Love...,"City of Lost Children is a Japanese contemporary version of Bonnie and Clyde. Kei is about to be deported, but her boyfriend Mario steps in between the law and rescues her in order for them to set sail for freedom. In order to reach freedom they need to buy a couple of very expensive tickets through a crook who has specialized in helping criminals leave the country. Thus, Kei and Mario attempt to rob the mafia in order to get the money for the trip.

City of Lost Souls is a changing story that jumps everywhere and at times does not make sense at all. Nevertheless, the cinematography is magnificent, which adds some spice to the overall experience."
1,Not an Ounce of Romance,"This is a dated romance novel if ever I read one. I kept reading it just to see how much worse it would get. Bartram Kingman is the 'hero' and Regan, his cousin, is the heroine. What did she do to deserve falling in love with him?When she hears he is going to visit Regan envisions a nerdy fellow (if only that had been the case). Instead she gets a bossy jerk of a cousin. Of course, there is the attraction. But he is a physically abusive man, putting her in her place by--for example, choking her with his bare hands in the middle of an arguement to the point where the room was gaining a red haze for her.Oh yup. I normally get a kick out of the various dated things in these older novels (the smoking, the clothing desrciptions, etc) This was one jaw dropping moment after another. Definately ripe for some feminist literature paper. But not for a good romance novel to curl up with on a rainy afternoon."
3,"Cool weather, comfy and nice looking","I bought these gloves for riding in the cold, 40 degrees and below. They were recommended by the dealer. I wore them in 40 degrees for half hour and my fingers were in pain. This was on a V-strom with handguards. They are no better than the ones I already own. And the liner comes out when you pull the glove off and jams up when you put the glove back on. I would like a refund but don't have the tag. And the right one is tighter than the left one. Would I buy them again.....no."
3,Not yet tested,"I just bought these gloves for riding in cold weather in Central Fl. The owner of the shop here in Daytona, said he owns a pair and is happy with them. My ride, when wearing them, will be approximately 45 minutes at temps between 40 - 32 degrees in speeds up to and around 70mph on the infamous I-4. Anything colder, I'll drive the cage. I'll check back once I get a chance to really give a good review."
4,Great and Good for the Environment,"Great cleaning ability and leaves the dishes with a nice lemon smell. It does clean really well. The only reason I can't give it a 5 star review is that sometimes, it does leave a light film on the clear glasses. Otherwise, very good for the enviroment and very good cleaner!"
3,SCENT more powerful than the SOAP,"I have tried other products in this brand line, and have liked them very much-- but this one doesn't clean well, and the scent is SO strong that it drives my husband out of the house. There are more effective, environmentally sound automatic dishwashing soaps out there (and at Amazon)."
1,"Sorry, but this is a miss...","The milky film stays on all the glassware right out of the dishwasher...No test kitchen? Mrs Meyers, what gives???I use almost all of your products but this is too much work. I don't have time or want to waste the resources to re-wash everything.Sorry, but this is a miss..."
2,Waste of $,I didn't mind the smell but it failed to clean my greasy pots and pans. I am using 7th Generation powder now and will restock 7th Gen when I run out.
3,Leaves a film in hard water zones.,"I wish I could leave a 5 star review, as I am generally an avocate for natural products, but this just doesn't cut the mustard, literally. I find that even if I wash the dishes completely before cycling them, they come out with a dull film that looks worse than before. I'm sure they are ""clean"" but I wouldn't want to serve my dishes to company like that. My compromise is to use Cascade to brighten everything up if I'm having guests. It does smell great, but that doesn't lift my mood as much as re-washing dishes brings it down! All the other Mrs. Meyers products I have tried have been great. I just wouldn't recomend this to anyone with lots of minerals in their water."
1,Stinky product,"""Includes a pleasant fragrance to fill your kitchen with freshness"" - This products are SO STINKY we had to wash our dishes several times afterward using this product to get the smell out of the dishes and the kitchen. If you enjoy drinking a cup of tea and smelling your dishwasher soap, then by all means, this is the product for you. If you are chemically sensitive, stay away from all Mrs. Meyers products. Their ""aromatherapy"" is not good for anyone."
1,"Smells great, just wish it cleaned the dishes!","I love everything else I've tried from Mrs. Meyer's, but this stuff is awful. It doesn't matter HOW much you use. We have a water softener, and the soap still leaves a terrible film on everything. Stuff looks filthy when its done in the dishwasher, especially silverware. Also, poor marks for actually cleaning the dishes. Stuff like coffee, not dried on. If I have to wash the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, and again after its done to get rid of the film?!! I think not. I sure wish I didn't still have so much of this."
1,What a waste of my money,So I love the Mrs Meyers products in general and use all of the housecleaning products. I decided to use the diswashing liquid because it got pretty good reviews. Well I'm not sure what those folks saw but what I saw were simple rings in my coffee cups that would be easy to remove with Cascade. It did a lousy job cleaning any of our dishes and we generally rinse our dishes before they go into the dishwasher. Don't waste your money on this.
5,fabulous!,"I love the way this smells. It fills the kitchen with such a nice aroma. It actually cleaned all my dishes, pots/pans included. Everything was sparkling clean and fresh. I used less of this than my normal automatic dish soap. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthier, effective dishwasher detergent.I found another use for this yesterday and I had to share it. This is the best bathroom cleaner I have ever used! This cleaned the sink so well. It was the BEST toilet bowl cleaner I have ever used! The bathroom smelled so fresh when I was done, it made doing bathroom duty a real treat. So just another use for this great dishwashing liquid. A little goes a long way."
2,Good for the environment but so so for the dishes,Not at all satisfied with Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Automatic Dishwashing Liquid. I use many other products from Mrs. Meyer's and am very satisfied. This product just does not get the dishes clean without putting them in the dishwasher already basically clean after a thorough rinse. Still looking for an environmentally friendly dishwashing liquid or powder.
1,A waste of a nice setting...,"Upon finding myself with time to spare in a library one morning, my eye chanced upon this book, one of a series of which I had previous perused a few & found them wanting. Returning to the fabulous adventures of dear Phryne after several years increased my dislike of the woman. She is is the absolutely perfectest person on the planet & the reader's main response is to want to slap her. She is ""posh"" but doen't let it interfere in her interactions with lesser beings; she has a maid, but they're really like bestest friends; she has a married lover, but his wife approves; she has a lovely house with staff; a gorgeous car; a drool-worthy wardrobe; is understanding, open minded, accepting of others' differences and has adopted two common little orphan girls. While the mysteries themselves are diverting and the descriptions of Melbourne wonderful, one spends most of the book hoping that the heroine will be pushed under a train or one of those zippy Melbourne trams."
1,Castlemaine Murders,"I thought I was buying a book about Castlemaine in County Kerry, Ireland, where my ancestors came from, only to find that there is apparantly a Castlemaine, Australia as well (which probably has my ancestors too, but I haven't found that in any research as yet.) Therefore, I really had no interest in the book and just donated it to a local charity."
4,The Student Body by J.S. Borthwick,"The campus of Maine's Bowmouth College looks like a picture postcard of New England-snow-covered lawns, students in colorful ski parkas, icicles dangling on the ivied halls. Sarah Deane-English Fellow with an honorary degree in sleuthing-expects to spend a quiet term here taking some graduate courses and doing a little teaching.But then Sarah finds that someone's organized an advanced course in murder. The first lesson comes when a woman student is found frozen into a prize-winning snow sculpture during Carnival weekend. The second is served up with a cozy cup of poisoned cocoa. And when the clues point straight to an English department already rife with rivalries, Sarah realizes that a little learning can be a very dangerous thing..."
5,Cadillac Parts From Amazon !!,"I couldn't believe I found a fuel pump for my 1960 Cadillac at Amazon.This came shipped to my house for less money than I could find it locally,a lot less!!!Thanks Amazon!I will be using Amazon again for sure."
1,not impressed,"I got this when my son was born. He just turned two and already outgrown it, and he's averaged sized. He can't even sit back all the way because the shoulder ""tabs"" are so close together. It does not lay back all the way, and when my son does manage to fall asleep in it, not only can he not sit back all the way, but his legs are too long for the stroller. He always looks extremely uncomfortable in it, and I'm in the market for a new one. It's bulky, takes up a whole lot of room in the trunk, and is not an easy ride or push. I am very uncomfortable pushing it more than 1/2 mile, it just requires a lot of effort and maneuvering.I absolutely would not suggest you buy this stroller. I've talked with other parents who've had the stroller for a while and they all say the same thing. It looks nice, and yes, everyone has it and it's a popular one, but you won't be happy with it for long."
1,tito & company rocks,"if you like tito & tarantula, this group is just up your alleytheir second cd after dark, with the hit single ""bed of lies""is much more polished and i think better than the first. don't get me wrong the first rocks also, if your a fan of tito's these are a must for your collection, good southwestern (and a little latin flavor) rock band, in the vain of the fabulous thunderbirdssound"
5,Grizzly Bears,"Shows the habitat, characteristics, and range of grizzly bears. Majority of book covers a two year life cycle of a sow and her cubs. Includes some really nicely detailed illustrations. A few extra bear facts are presented at the end of the book. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
2,Nice illustrations; false information,"Mediocre child's book about grizzly bears provides basic information about anatomy and the life cycle of the sow and her cubs. Presents evolutionary theory as both a belief and a fact on the second page. ""Many scientist believe the bear family...evolved from the dog family about 20 million years ago. Around 3 million years ago they began to look like the bears we know today.""The author also indicates that the sow and her cubs hibernate. Contrary to popular belief (due to elementary teaching in public schools), bears do not hibernate. They go through a period called dormancy, which differs from hibernation in many ways. Children can handle accurate information, so why not provide it?Two stars given (rather than one) for beautiful illustrations."
1,NOT 101 SONGS!! / JUST 10!!,"I can not get a refund since it does technically say ""sampler"" on it. haven't listened to it, maybe its good. bought it for a friend of mine. hope she likes it!"
3,French Country Bench Review,The color is not the same as in the description (light green instead of ivory). The quality is ok as expected.
1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would","Great price, poor product. They are beautiful upon arrival. I washed them according to manufacturer's instructions. You would not believe the copius amounts of lint that piled up in the lint catcher of my dryer (usually a sign of poor fabric quality). While folding them up, I discovered that most of the hems had unraveled and frayed. And I hadn't even used them yet! Unbelievable. I returned them for a full refund, including shipping (and I stupidly purchased 2 sets). Goes to show you get what you pay for. Never again!"
5,Love My Sheets!!,I was very pleased with my new sheets. They were exactly as advertised and are so soft. Don't need ironing either. You gotta love that!!
1,soft not crisp 300 count sheetsTher,These sheets were soft and wrinkled not crisp. They were peeled in 3 months and felt like sand paper. I did not like these at all.
3,I like one song,I bought it for one song.I haven't listened to the rest.I will get around to listening to the rest.The rest is probably good.
3,Blechh,"Well, I can give this album credit for the first and last tracks, plus the interesting instrumentals, but I cant reach too far beyond that. This one certainly does not reflect the essence of Black Sabbath."
3,well,sweet leaf is a great song but the rest of the material is so and so...well lord of this world is great! i like it so much! solitude is a great positive song!
3,3rd Effort - Not the Best,"This is not the best Sabbath album, IMHO. There are quite a few out there that will disagree with my assesment, but this is an ""ok"" Sabbath album. The riff style shows no changes or experimentation from the previous two albums. In Volume Four, this will change, with fresh life injected into the riff work. Lyrically, the album pales in comparison to Paranoid before it, and Volume Four after it. It is not their worst album, just not the best foot that they've put forward on other works."
2,or maybe 2.5 stars,"Like many other Black Sabbath albums, ""Master of reality"" includes great songs (""Sweet leaf"" and ""Solitude"") as well as decent ones (""After forever), and even awful stuff (like the instrumental unnecessary ""Embryo"" and ""Orchid""). At least the not-remastered version is very poorly produced, and the overall dull bass sounds makes you wonder if you're wearing ear-plugs. Black Sabbath were very uneven in general and in particular during the Ozzy years, so for the less dedicated fan some ""best of"" album would be all you need."
5,really 10,after forever is the best black sabbath song ever.it has 2 great guitar riffs and its not extremely repetitive and anoying (sry but i dont like black sabbath the song) songs like into the void and sweet leaf are adding greatness to the cd but nothing to compare to after forever
5,Vinyl Review...Stellar worth every Penny!,If you got the equipment to appreciate Vinyl the this will make you very happy indeed! I would encourage you to buy this and replace your old worn out copy!
4,I'm the first to review THIS album?,"This legendary album follows the even more famous Paranoid, and it somewhat more upbeat in some songs. Unfortunately, like Vol. 4, it has some ""filler"" songs that just take up space. It's a must have, though, because of songs like Sweet Leaf, Children of the Grave, and Into the Void, the last song being the icing on the cake to the 60's antinuclear protest movement. Solitude is also a great acoustical guitar song. Obviously a must have for Sabbath fans."
5,Sabbath's BEST Album!,"Although the 1st two were were groundbreaking, this was and still IS there best overall all album. For every Hard-hitting Heavy Metal fan this is a Must. However after hearing Sweet Leaf for over a thousand times, it's not as exciting. Check out Children of the Grave, Lord of this World, Into the Void, and After Forever. Solitude is great too! Next album to get is Sabatoge! Overall all a good album."
5,Who would have Sabbath could do Christian music?,"This is the first Sabbath Album I've ever heard, and I loved it. After Forever has got to be one of the best songs ever written. Also good: Children of the Grave, Lord of this World, and Into the Void"
2,Remastered????????,"This is my favorite Black Sabbath album, but I am sorely disappointed with this ""remaster"". It doesnt sound any better than my original. Its got a murky low sound just as it always has had.You couldnt prove to me its any better sounding.I liked the 2nd cd of extras but nothing really standout.The 1 new song was cool(thats why 2 stars)Weevil Woman. Overall the cd set is not worth the money as I think its kinda shoddy at best.....support your favorite artists..........."
5,Wall O' Sludge!,"This is one of the sludgiest, heaviest albums known to man. 30 years after this album was released, it is still heavier than a lot of stuff out there. It has this doomy, sludgy, impossibly heavy sound to it that cannot be duplicated. Ozzy's voice sounds just perfect on this. So does Tony Iommi's guitar playing. Bill Ward's drums, too. The drums sound especially thumping, with that underwater sound in them. This album contains many of the bands best songs such as Children Of the Grave, Into The Void, Sweet Leaf, and the odd, flute-heavy ballad Solitude. No true metalhead should be without this masterpiece."
3,Intresting but not with the feel of other sabbath albums.,"My least favorite Sabbath album, although definetly not a bad album it doesnt seem to have the feeling usually envoked by Sabbath. The strongest point in the album is Children of the grave inbetween two small but excellent guitar solo's. Songs of intrset on the album are ""after forever"" the bands only Christian song. Which is good to through into the face of people who think Black Sabbath is ""devils music."" Children of the Grave, aswell as Lord of this World are very strong lyrically."
4,"Say what you like, Sabbath made great music","I find it surprising that some people critisise Black Sabbath for their supposedly Satanic image, and are quite willing to overlook the fact that one of the most overrated bands ever-Led Zeppelin-has a picture of naked children on their ""Houses of the Holy"" album..."
3,"It's good ,but overrated","The Ozzy Black Sabbath is my favourite music so you could say I am big fan of 70's Sabbath.However if anyone is reading these reviews to get an idea about which Sabbath album to buy , I BEG you not to believe most of the other reviews for this album. It still has some great music but it is not, repeat, not, the best Sabbath album.""Sabotage"", ""Paranoid"" and ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" are all better.Trust me.Please."
5,The magic of Paranoid lives on into MOR,"Timeless is the right word for this album. It continues the magic touch of Paranoid, unlike the other albums. Songs like ""Into the Void"" and ""Children of the Grave"" are some of Sabbath's greatest numbers. Also there is a lot of experimentation, especially in songs like ""Solitude"" and ""Orchid""...which shows Sabbath's creativity."
5,Another Sabbath Masterpiece,"Iommi and company took the world by storm with their first two releases. Their critical third in my opinion threw them over the top. From the opening coughs of ""Sweet Leaf"", to the last drum beat of ""Into The Void"", the entire album is killer. They were able to play both sides of the coin on this one, with ""After Forever"" willing people to look at what their doing and realize that ""God is the one"", to the flip side with an ode to the Devil himself on ""Lord Of This World"" (read the lyrics to that one to see what I mean). The album happens to contain two Sabbath favorites of mine, the aforementioned Into The Void, as well as Embryo/Children Of The Grave. Highly recommended, do go out and buy it now, if it's not in your collection already."
4,great album. way overpriced.,"Yes, I know this is an import. But, I can't understand why someone thinks that we should pay double the price for a second disc of demos and outtakes. There's a reason this stuff never made the disc in the first place: the quality level is not anywhere near as high. These extra tracks should be thrown in for next to nothing, because they are rarely worth more than that. Such is the case here. This is a superb Sabbath record, but the price is far too high for this ""deluxe"" version. Stick with the original single disc, or look for this on Ebay at a much lower price. I paid $18 for it."
4,Very Dark Sabbath album.,Very good era of the black sabbath's with Ozzy Osbourne.I listened the lyricks especially they are fit Today and the songs remains the same.
1,this company is rude and mis leading,there pictures say for the ipod shuffle nano and mini but you only get the nano charger and they wont take responsability for there mistake
2,Didn't work out,"The friend who I purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too FAST for her to keep up with. She is used to a two wheeled walker, but wanted one with a seat. She didn't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund. It turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund; so she didn't return it. The lesson: better buy local if you're not sure!"
3,"Good enough, but not perfect","This product was delivered in a carton that had some damage, but it seemed to arrive intact. It was quite easy to put together, and works well enough. HOWEVER - one of the hand brakes does not ""lock"" as it should (it doesn't ""lock"" at all, actually). I sent a note to Drive asking if I could repair this myself, as it is not (to me) a severe enough problem to warrant return/replacement. To date, my inquiry has fallen into a ""black hole"" - I have had no response from Drive of any kind. Also - because of how the back is packaged for shipping, a little of the blue paint was abraded off, leaving a shiny aluminum metal spot. That should not happen. Again, this is cosmetic and has zero effect on the usefulness of this product."
5,A Good Purchase,"I purchased this Go-Lite Rollator 4-5yrs. ago for my mother. The product is well built, with great features."
3,OK BUT,"I too was disappointed in the color - looks more black than green. If you have hand or shoulder problems, you may find brakes difficult to apply. On a positive note, rollator was very easy to put together and reasonably priced."
1,Oh my god,Doug Bell...er...Kendall spent some dough and self-published this piece of literary excrement?
4,'VAN GOGH IN SPACE',"Hi, this book was written in the time frame during the Desert Storm War. This book branches out into the unknown world/s of the event horizon, and black holes. The imagination is grasped here in this tale to start off a series of adventures. Lots of fun reading, goes fast, and leaves you hungry for more."
1,"42"" incompatible?!?!?!?","Once again, wish I had read the reviews. 42"" plasme TV incompatible with wall mount. Worse yet, it's a gift to my mother-in-law and now I have to scramble to get a mount. Why the false advertising? This is one web retailer that's down the tubes for me."
1,"Whisper Connect?! Hah! Should be called ""Screech Connect""!","This unit worked well for the first few months. However, like the previous reviewer, our unit also beeps randomly for no apparent reason, even though we have the pet detection system OFF. Nor is it a low battery issue- it happens even when the receiver is plugged in. The system now seems perfectly timed for the alarm to go off the instant the baby has fallen asleep. It has awakened our baby more times than we can count, so we will be getting another system after we throw this one in the pool. Save your money!"
1,"Will only ""work"" for a year or so",We are on our second baby and this monitor has been waking us more than he has. It was perfect with our first and now it beeps several times an hour.
2,Only choice for pet sensor,"We really want the pet sensor because we want to keep our cats out of the babies' room, and this appears to be the only choice. The range is ok -- it works in the yard for the most part, and a tiny bit at the neighbors houses. It is a little on the bulky side. After two years, the battery is completely shot, and it just started not working well when plugged in either. You can't turn off the pet sensor from the remote unit, just the one in the baby's room. The motion alarm is very loud and annoying. This is no good for young kids not in cribs who may get out of bed occasionally. The unit now loses its connection and starts beeping loudly frequently throughout the night. In the past it only did that occasionally. I'd say this is a good purchase for the first year but no fun beyond that."
1,Worthless!,"Model: evenflo whisper connect, pet sensa, 900MHz (not the 2-way)Experience: 4 monthsPros: small, cheapCons: static, crackling, popping, buzzing and generally unreliableAfter fighting with this monitor for 4 months now, I've finally had it and will be replacing it soon (then totally destroying the old one). When you turn it on, it generally starts with static. After turning it on/off a few times you might get a signal... but not for long. Switching channels is a joke and the pet sensa is worthless (who actually uses it). OVERALL EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT WORKS 20% OF THE TIME."
1,No good,I agree with all of the others who have given this product a neg review. We ran into the same issue so this is not an isolated incident. Our monitor will just randomly go off and start making very loud beeps or a terrible screeching noise for no reason at all. I would really recommend not buying this monitor!
1,Note: Only 2 Channels,"Before buying this item, be aware that it has only 2 channels. The Sony monitors have 9 or 27 channels, which can really help minimize interference with phones and other electronics."
2,works well when not alarming,"The range is huge, the clarity is perfect (can hear baby breathe), but the alarm (out of range, time to recharge?) that randomly goes off (especially at night!) is unacceptable. Only buy this monitor if you want to be woken up more often than you already are by the baby. I'm going back for the Sony today..."
2,not a good buy!,"Yes, the reception was great for us and we have a 2200 sqft house...problem: the ANNOYING pet-detection alarm went off for no reason, and we had that feature turned off! It almost always happened in the middle of the night too, like I've read in other reviews. That's enough to freak you out in the wee hours, forget about a peaceful night's sleep. We took this monitor back tonight and will try the Sony 9 station."
3,Pet detection works....however annyoing alarm clock sound,"This monitor seems to work great, except for the annoying alarm clock sound that occurs at random times of the day and night. I did contact evenflo and they offered to send me a new monitor. This is the only model with pet detection, so they are going to send the same model, but if the same issue occurs, they will replace the unit with a different model. At least they are owning up to the problem and trying to do something to replace it. Other than the random alarm, this unit works great."
2,Beeps way too often....,"I bought this monitor after having tried the one I got from my baby shower that was from Pottery Barn Kids. It also gave me trouble. I decided to head to Babies R Us and see what I could find. This was ideal for me because even though I have no cats, I do have 3 dogs.I tried it with the pet sensor on for about 1 day. Then I turned it off because it seemed to go off all the time for no apparent reason. Even with the pet sensor off, it stills beeps very often. I have to get up and turn the unit off and back on almost one after the other some days and we end up just turning it off altogether to try again later.I'm looking now to try another unit and hopefully we'll be able to find one that we like!"
3,Needs Work,I've had the baby monitor for 3 months now. I have also had my monitor beep at random for no reason which can be annoying when you are trying to sleep. But it does work like it should when a pet enters the room. The volume could be louder. Even though it comes with a rechargable battery pack the battery life is not that long. The product does need some work. It's strange to see that the companies that make monitors have not thought about how many households have pets. This was the only product I found with this type of feature.
1,Stay aware from this product!,"Like many other reviews, this product is a piece of junk! The parent finder beeper goes off randomly! It usually does this in the middle of the night while I'm asleep for a change. I cannot figure out why it beeps for no reason. It doesn't matter if it's fully charged, plugged in or not, the thing just beeps. Please find another product or this one will drive you crazy!"
2,Wil and Alyssa Mom,"We bought this for out two year olds room, when the old Evenflo died. We sleep down stairs and he is up and we just want to hear if he needs us in the middle of the night. It was a bad choice, it beeps when it can not find the signal and my house is not that big. It is going back to the store. We have no problem with the fisher price monitors we use for our daughter."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We have had this monitor for 5 months and loved it... till last week. It wakes us up every night beeping and the only way to get it to stop is to turn it off and turn it back on, only to have it wake us a few hours later. I traded it in for another one, and the very first night, it did the same thing. So, if our son is not waking us up it is the monitor. I am returning it tomorrow for a completely different brand."
4,Works well,"We have yet to use the pet detector feature-decided to hold off from bringing the cat into the house with the baby, but the rest of the system works well. The reception is very clear-can hear the baby breathing and moving around. Have had no problems with range, although the farthest we've had the units apart was 100 feet. The monitor does beep sometimes-we thought because the unit was running out of batteries when unplugged-but has not been annoying."
2,Not Pleased,"I bought this product in 3/2005 for that it is the only one in the market that I have found that comes with rechargeable batteries and that it recharges them. The receiver starts beeping which is the paging feature that goes off all by itself, also the sound is very low even when put on high. You must have the unit right next to your ear to hear the baby. I do not recommend this product, if you want to sleep in peace."
5,"Good Bible, Good With Macintosh","The NRSV is a laudable translation of the Bible. The inclusive gender language is a major improvement. The annotations are very helpful, but appear to be essentially identical to RSV annotations from 30 years ago. The software runs well on Macs - it's stable, and, once you are familiar with the interface, very easy to use."
3,Oxford Annotated Bible,It's okay. It has the Apocryphal Bible books which is nice for Bible as Lit class.
4,Excellent Study Bible,"I must qualify this review by writing that I have just begun Bible study and have read only King James and RSV with some review of NIV. I have found the Oxford Edition of the NRSV to be easy to read without moving too far from original sources. Though I often prefer the poetic style of the KJV, the Oxford NRSV is my Bible of choice for personal study. I highly recommend this Bible."
4,"NOAB/NRSV: great translation, fishy notes","The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) will always be my favorite translation and my default bible. This is due to its scholarship, faithfulness to the Greek and Hebrew, and its inclusive language. The New Oxford Annotated Bible (NOAB) is a different matter. The notes in the NOAB sow seeds of doubt. Just read the notes in Daniel. The NOAB claims the whole book is a story. They sow these seeds in other parts of the Word as well. I recomend the Orginal OAB instead or the Access Bible. It's way better than the NOAB. If you chose to use the NOAB, just be prepared for a lot of doubt!"
5,Buy it!!!,"This version of the Bible is great for religion classes or individual study. The notes, introductions, and essays are great for helping to make sense of one of the most difficult books of all time. Great translation, great layout. Definitely my favorite copy of the Bible!!!"
3,Upside down pages,"The book is in good condition for the most part, the cover is a bit worn but most of the pages are fine, except that an entire 70 pages in the middle of Apocrypha are upside down (though still in order) and some of those pages are cut or ripped and generally more worn than the rest of the pages."
2,not what I expected,I was looking forward to using this new Bible for study and for prayer. I was not aware that Apocrypha was not included. No where in the ad was it mentioned that this bible did not include this element of the New Revised Standard Version. I will be able to use this Bible for some of my study program but I had to buy another Bible that included the Apocrypha to assist my prayer life.
5,One of the best overall Bibles out there,"When I first came in contact with this Bible I thought it above average. However as I have read more of it I find that it is very accurate. The NRSV has become my favorite translation, and the notes of the Oxford Study Bible are illuminating. The annotators are for the most part believing Christians, though they are more moderate than the NIV Study Bible annotators. The notes are fairly numerous and the essays and maps are a nice touch. There is also a small concordance in the back. I would never be without this Bible, and I am an orthodox, believing Christian. As always I advise consulting multiple versions when attempting to do a complete study."
4,All is well,The item came much sooner than I expected it and even though i purchased it used it is in very good condition.
5,Bible Study,I was very pleased with my purchase. It is a great help to the bible studies that I have taken. I am so glad that I purchased this Bible.
4,mmm...,"i was honestly not expecting the SHORT version of the actual book that I wanted, but I guess it's my fault for not reading the information correctly."
2,corrects previous review,"The previous review that I submitted was supposed to be for the RSV not the NRSV. the NRSV gets 2 stars from me for taking an elegant and literal translation and ruining it with politically correct inclusive language and a flat, unliterary style."
1,This is not the Apocrypha as advertised!,"This is not the Apocrypha. The picture on the Amazon webpage is not the book that you will receive. I ordered it based the picture of the book, and then sent it back when it arrived and was just a revised Bible. I have reported this but it has not been corrected yet."
1,Not for the serious Bible student or scholar,"I agree with the reader from New York. Biblical scholarship and accuracy in translation have been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. While the Bible reads comfortably and is unencumbered by in-place notes and references, the footnotes at the bottom of the pages deny the truthfulness of God's Word. The reader is left to wonder how the editors decided which part of what God said He really meant."
1,"THE ""POLITICALLY CORRECT"" VERSION OF THE BIBLE","If you want a version of the Bible which fits the current criteria of being ""politically correct"", then this is the version for you. The translators have taken the liberty to change all references to males and made them gender inclusive. For example ""brothers"" is ""brothers and sisters""; ""mankind"" is ""humankind"". God did not create ""man"" in this Bible (Genesis 1.27), He created ""humankind"". They do footnote these ""politically correct"" changes with the actual original translations, but the text does not follow the original.It's a sad note when even the Holy Bible has to be subjected to this modern censorship by the ""politically correct""."
1,Bad Service,"I tried to order a used copy from Powell's Books in Oregon. Two days later they notify me that my order is cancelled because the book is not available. They claim that they update ads nighly; however, at this writing, the book is still offered. I requested the cheapest used copy, so I'm wondering if this is a bait and switch tactic. I've taken my business elsewhere."
1,Theological Commentary - Is This Book Right for You,"The editorial comments included in this study bible are unacceptable and many border on blaspheme if you take the bible literally. The translation is acceptable, but questions whether prophecy actually occurred/occurs. It seems to condone homosexual activities as opposed to other sexual immorality. Scientific research of other cultures is quite in-depth, but comments on other sciences are misleading and incorrect or outright fabrication."
2,A real disappointment.,I bought this book for my first trip to Amsterdam. The basic info is sound but there were some problems. The most annoying is that key parts of maps end up in the middle (binding) making them difficult to read. The restaurant reviews were in inaccurate and left the reader wondering whether anyone from Frommers had been in the restaurant. In summary the book is OK but there are better ones on the market.
3,"Ideas maps, and more","If you want to plan a great trip to Amsterdam Frommer's will help. Once you're there you can look up maps, access important numbers, and reference articles or sights easily with bookmarks or the search feature. The digital edition make sit so you can store every city in the world in one simple to carry item. It has historical information a plenty, and some advice for the red-light district. If you want more juts go to Frommer's online and see reviews and more up to date information on everything."
4,Quality Info,"Quality overview of equipment and techniques for sailboat racing crew.Spot on instruction, but the book could benefit from some additional illustrations."
4,Intense,"One of the most intense writings of the King. Quick, easy to read, but deeply shocking, Thinner will throw you into one of the most frightnening nightmare of all: to disappear."
3,Even I know that this is not one of his best!,"I have to admit that I have only read a couple of King's novels, but I can still tell that this is not up to his usual brilliance. Quite why Halleck does what he does at the end is a real mystery to me. It falls short firmly on this matter. It does have its moments, but they are by far and away outweighed by the failings of this novel. You can read worse books than this, but compared to King's other titles, it just doesn't cut it!"
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","When Billy Halleck kills an old woman, he doesn't know what he is in for. Overweight, he suddenly begins to loswe weight. Hey this is great, or so he thinks. When the weight loss continues he suddenly becomes worried. With no medical explanation, what else can it be but a gypsy curse. How ridiculous. This is by far the worst book that I have ever listened to by Richard Bachman. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because we all know that Richard Bachman is a pseudonym for Stephen King.Folks, if your going to read something by this author, safe this one till last."
2,Boring says it all,This book was boring. Most of it concerned the main character chasing an old gypsy through New England so he could take a curse away. The only interesting character was the mobster. Anyone could predict the ending fifty pages before.I am a big Stephen King fan and 'Richard Bachman' and this has to be his worst.
5,This book kicked ***,"This book rocks. It had me on the edge of my seat all the time, I couldn't put it down. I finished reading the book faster than any other book I've ever read"
2,A letdown.,"This book was intresting and suspenseful, for the most part atleast. I thought that the characters in it were intresting (with the exception of Genilli...it's so refreshing when writers stay away from racial stereotypes), that it was fairly well writen, and the story was reasonably compelling. The problem with the book is the ending. The ending was a complete letdown. The problem is, and I don't want to give away anything here, that you can't empathise with the main character's decision in any way. The movie isn't very good either, though I did like that the decision that he made at the end made a bit more sense. Anyways, I say that you read through the book, get to about the end, and make up your own ending. It'll be far more satisfying."
1,King's Worst,"This story by Stephen King is terrible. It's about a fat guy who is cursed to lose weight until he dies because he killed a gypsy. The whole book the guy just tries to blame other people and not take responsibility. In fact, there isn't one likeable character in this book and the only interesting one is a gangster named Ginelli. In conclusion, don't read this book just find any other one by King because they are all better than this."
1,Boring,"This books was so boring. Another novel by Stephen King that fails to scare the reader and fails to be good. Why not write more books like IT and Carrie that were actually good!! King usually does an ok job, but this time he totally missed the boat."
1,Not Literature,"I read this when I had broken my leg and I must say I was not that impressed. The ending with him leaving the cherry pie where his wife and daughter could get at it was unmotivated. I don't understand why the character wanted his wife to catch his curse. Also, I had just read ""100 Years of Solitude"" before this and it made it clear why this is not literature. There was no concentration or density to the writing. It did not look like he broke a sweat to write it. Also, since this was a Richard Bachman book originally, it was trite how he had Backman refer to a ""Stephen King"" book. This is a book that should have stayed in the drawer. Also, it was apparent that he didn't research much about the Gypsies. The supposed Romany language was actually another language, I read."
4,Solid Book,"People don't give a lot of credit to Thinner but even though it wasn't King's finer books, it still had a great plot and a great ending. This book I would give 4 and a half stars instead.This book was about a guy named Billy Halleck who was cursed by a gypsy. He is now growing thinner by the day. The only way to get him back to normal is by finding the gypsies and asking them to reverse the curse. Along the way he meets up with hs friend Ginelli and he causes problems with the Gypsies.What I am trying to say about this book is that it is a great book. People think a SK book has to be scary. This book was his least scariest but very suspenseful. The ending also had a twisted ending. Read it and you will see why.So, to get this book or not? I think you should get this book because it is a great story and sometimes humorous. Thnk twice about not getting this book."
3,Confusing and Exciting,"This book kept me up for 3 nights in a row. I kept snacking while I read it and I couldn't put it down! I agree with the main character Billy in that it was his wife's fault when he struck and killed the old Gypsy woman. But I don't think he should have gone through such drastic measures to make sure she suffered. I enjoyed the story, but i was gravely disappointed at the ending. I give the book 3 stars."
4,Revenge really doesn't pay in this case,"I started the book a few weeks before I saw the movie. I enjoyed book. To me, I thought about the moral. Revenge doesn't pay. I thought about how I would feel if I were placed in Billy's shoes. His wife turned on him and sided with the doctor. His daughter didn't understand what was going on and he certainly couldn't explain it to her, no time. But in the end, he realizes that he took all the time trying to get the curse off and it just got him back to where he was in the beginning...nowhere"
1,A trite romp through the mind of a tired horror writer.,"Thinner seems to be descriptive of more than just the lead character in this book. The plot, and subtext are also afflicted with this gypsy's curse. While King's usual writing style leans heavily on sudden graphic detail, Thinner is based primarily on screenplay melodrama.I believe this book to be much like the filler in a good cigar, all substance and no flavor.Stay away from lame curses, and stick to angry cats and Randall Flagg's."
4,Read this book!!!,"If you like to read mystery and horror stories this book is for you. This book isabout a man named Billy Halleck that is very rich and over weight. One day he is drivingalong and he starts to argue with his wife Heidi, and not paying any attention to the roadhe hits a gypsy man and kills him and the gypsy man's wife cast a thinner spell on him.This spell, unwillingly makes you lose weight rapidly, Is this a good thing or a bad thing?And if it is how is he going to stop the spell?I think this book was a big success and it was interesting down to the very last word, alsothis book is write by the most creative and popular author to every create a book. Isuggest this book to people that like to read horror and mystery stories.by: D.M."
4,Thinner,"Thinner was a very suspensfull, and thrilling book to read. It kept me at the edge of my seat, and always wanting more. This book is about a man, Billy Halleck, who gets cursed by a gypsy man, for killing the gypsies wife. The gypsy also manages to curse some other main chacters in the town. I would recommend this book to anyone who has liked any mystery story, likes curses, or has enjoyed any of Stephen Kings' other books."
3,That's the end?,"This is was an okay book. It was a little hard to get into. The ending left me with mixed emotions. In a way it was memorable, and fitting. Yet, in another way, it doesn't make any sense!"
2,This is pretty bad.,"I really don't like this book very much because most of the book was spent trying to track down that freakin' gypsy. That guy was trying to do that through the entire book while he almost drove his family insane, and kept losing weight. I think he should have stayed with those research people. This also has a very odd ending."
2,Worst King Book Ever!,"I must say that Thinner was the worst Stephen King book ever. It has horrible characters, a dumb story, and does not hold your interest. It was so bad I never even bothered to finish it. This book was bad! For a good read read It, The Stand, or The Shining."
3,I've read better by him but King could never write bad,"I am a huge King fan and it's not to say that I did not like this book, I just do not think it is his best piece. I admit I may have enjoyed the book more if I hadn't seen the movie first. What made the book less appealing was all of the information about Ginelli which did not keep my interest and made the book drag. I thought the whole storyline to be another one that leaves you shaking your head saying, ""he's done it again"". The ending is especially one which really leaves you thinking, and again, if you've never seen the movie, you will be shocked! I like how King made the main character turn against and literally end up disgusted by his wife because of the events that took place. It is a short book so it is definitely worth the time of giving it a chance."
5,"The last Bachman book before his ""death""... King at his best","I read this book little after King had to step out as the man behind ""Richard Bachman"". Hiding under a nom de plume allowed King to make some of his most creative work. This novel is proof of it.O.K. So maybe a gypsy curse doesn't seem a fresh, new idea. But the whole scenario he builds for Billy Halleck after he is touched seems possible, making it the more horrific. In the book, Billy thinks at first he is wasting away because he might have cancer. These days, AIDS would be another good option about the ""sickness"" he catches.With just one single supernatural element (the curse), the story is left to play on the grounds of ""reality"". The effect is haunting."
3,some people...,"For one of his EARLY works (A lot of reviewers who call themselves King fans seem to think this was a recent publication, not a re-release), Thinner shows remarkable talent and storytelling. I have to admit, although it is not one of my favorite stories, I was so involved that when I got to the ending I threw the book across the room."
2,Kind of Boring...,"At the beginning when the guy starts losing weight, that's kind of cool. You think to yourself ""Wow, this is going to be awsome!"" But in the end, it's dumb. The guy goes through all this trouble... Pretty sad..."
4,too wordy at times but a great read,I thought this was a well written book overall. It gets wordy at times through the book but not to bad. I really think the ending suited the orginal crime it came back to him one way or another and instead of live life without his wife and daughter he made the choice to die with them. Even the italian thug who helps billy gets what he deserved in the end. I watched the movie along time before I read the book and let me tell you the book is so much better in my opinion.
1,BLAH!!!!!,"THINNER IS BORING AND THE MOVIE IS EVEN WORSE, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON KING'S WORST BOOK TO DATE"
1,"A total, utter debacle...","Normally I applaud King's works, but Thinner was one of the most terrible books I have read in my life. The storyline is bizarre, the beginning is an example of abject idiocy, the characters are apathetic fools, and the entire work overall is just simply terrible"
3,"Good story, but 'thin' on plot development","'Thinner' had an interesting 'Twilight Zone' premise, a good, fast-moving beginning, and a suspenseful conclusion, which just made the rest of the book worth reading. Unfortunately, the middle section, in which Ginelli takes over the action, and merely reports back to Billy, brought the story's pace to a near-standstill.King/Bachman might have been better off reducing this to a short story, and eliminating the tired cliches of both ""mob boss"" Ginelli and ""foreigner with bad command of English"" Lemke.Halleck and his wife, at least, were developed beyond the shallow, superficial level. But, as others have pointed out, neither of them were truly deserving of the readers' full sympathy.Even the scary, unknown nature of Halleck's plight was diminished by the similar afflictions of other characters, which lent to the repetitive nature of the majority of the story.Fans who 'hunger' for a great SK story may need to look elsewhere to really satisfy their appetites."
2,Originally Richard Bach? Correct me if I'm wrong please.,"I believe this was one of several stories that were originally in the Bachman Books but I may be wrong. Either way, this story (and definitely the movie too) were really disappointing to me. It was fun reading but it didn't seem as if Stephen King even wrote it because it wasn't of the same top quality I'm used to from him. I found the story to be quite silly."
3,"good, but he has many better!","The book was good, i read it in a day, like i usually do, but, it was lacking ....action. I was hoping for more action, but i am satisfied. Another novel well done."
3,Fair...I guess,"Ok, so I thought this book was ok, the movie made it better...if you like Stephen King, read it, if it doesn't sound that good, FORGET IT!"
2,nothing special,This could (or better should) have been a short story. Needlessly dragged to 300 pagesI am a fan of King's but this one is kinda lame and slow
2,This book is a reason to support book-burnings . . .,"Under normal circumstances, I would hail Stephen King as a great writer, at least within his own genre. He's imaginative, original and intelligent. But, ""Thinner"" was a horrible excuse for a book. It was written more like a bad TV-movie than a story to be enjoyed by his hardcore fans. Well, I'm not a hardcore anything.Perhaps if the last half of the book wasn't spent chasing the Gypsies Matlock-style it wouldn't have been so bad. Needless to say, I was entirely bored with Halleck and Ginelli's shenannigans(sp?).Furthermore, I think Stephen King should watch his ethnic stereotypes. All this book needed to validate it as a piece of dog turd was the tiresome cliche that Ginelli was:a gangland type killer. Mr. King's white-guy-makes-good status is getting to his head."
4,Thinner has a great ending...,This is a great book. Steven King has a way with creepy and unique story plots. It seems like the actions seems like it will never stop. Steven King makes gypsy curses seem real. The best part of the book is the ending. The ending was a surprise that hit you in the face like a loving pile of bricks.
2,IS THIS REALLY STEPHEN KING?,"this is one of the wrost stephen king books i've read. not scary, boring, and dragged. read some SK classics like: the shining, IT, or carrie. this is a waist of time. sorry man, this one doesn't work for me."
2,Almost...,"Not the best book I have ever read, but it was okay. I just kept waiting for something that never happened. I don't even know what that something was."
4,This book explains the consequenses of watching your weight.,"I thought that ""Thinner was a well-thought out book, with an easily followed story line and an interesting plot. The humorous aspect of the story had a moral: Don't watch your weight; someone else could be watching you! Stephen King has had yet another great success in the novel industry."
5,very very worth the read.,"overall, I really liked this book. it's much better than the movie because it's got a lot more characters and there's much more suspense offered in the book."
2,The Book By King.,"I am a very big King fan, yet ""Thinner"" is a disappointment.The book starts off well but quickly goes down hill. Not scary. Not fast moving. A complete and utter yawn. Don't try it! Only if you like reading King no matter what, you should not read this!"
3,This is not one of SK's finer books,"Maybe SK was coming into his own and finding his skills, but this book doesn't illustrate the Stephen King of today. I found this book to be almost boring in a sense. If it weren't for the well developed characters I would have hated it. The scare factor isn't very good at all. Its a bizarre story but nothing to make me look over my should at night. If you want to read one of his scarier books try Pet Semetary. If you want to venture out of the SK world, try Douglas Clegg or Bentley Little."
4,This is One of King's Better Novels,"THINNER, which was originally written in 1984, is a very effective novel. I've read most of King's books, and I would place this one in the top half. This book isn't necessarily horrific or scary, but it's pretty suspenseful. Unlike some of King's later books, this novel is short and tightly written, and it kept me interested until the very end.This novel deals with a overweight lawyer who is rapidly growing thinner, due to a curse inflicted upon him by gypsies. THINNER is unique in the sense that the main character is not a particularly heroic person, and in many ways is trying to escape responsibility for his own actions. This may turn off some readers, but I enjoyed this story's moral complexity. The ending of THINNER won't please everyone, but I felt it was appropriate and consistent with the overall point of the storyline.This novel isn't a classic, but it's a solid effort by one of the best genre writers around. Highly recommended for King fans."
3,Suspenseful but not frightening,"Perhaps I have an immunity to the chills of Stephen King's writing, but this book is not scary. The storyline itself is about an overweight lawyer who gets cursed for killing a gypsy woman and begins to lose weight... without ever reaching a limit. As his friends and family all become frightened and baffled by his inexplicable weight loss, the lawyer is haunted by ominous images of impending disintegration. The novel itself is quite suspenseful and intriguing, but overall the book did not have a very memorable effect on me."
2,weak,"Seems for most readers, this book keeps one up all along the night just to know how it ends (by the way the end sucks !). It's a pretty thin point to make a good book... And from my point I barely slept upon the book several times. At the beginning it could be interesting. Unfortunately, the author cannot do anything with his idea. After 100 pages, it becomes boring, useless, long and meanless. That was my first Stephen King's book, I've been very disapointed."
4,Lots of surprises,"The top 3 highlights that make this cd worth owning are: 3) Sharon Jones & Dap Kings rollicking version of ""This Land is Your Land."" 2) Willis (yes, the same band whose song is used on the sexy Fiat Abarth commercial) version of ""Word Up."" 1) Shawn Lee's version of ""Riverman."" The best moments on tribute or cover cd's is when another artist either makes a song their own, because their version is so superior to the original; or, the cover artist either re-invents or totally re-imagines the song. The latter is the case with Shawn Lee's cover of Nick Drake's ""Riverman."" The transformation is stunning and totally unique!"
3,"Cool gloves, extra hard duty.","This ones are extra hard duty gloves but cool looking.They are a little small, a size under the regular ones for Iicon gloves, I bought this pair L, but I felt them as M, they didn't fit well. Maybe it's becuase they are made extra hard duty."
5,MUST HAVE!you,This product is a must have for German language learners. It will give you tons of examples on how to use verbs in a correct way.
5,intellectual,After reading a philosophy of osteopathy I have a new found respect for medicine and the fields of human health and performance. I now have a background knowledge of the history of medicine. The pictures add a lot to the books depth.
4,Creative,"This book was very creative- and within that, very well done.The idea of linking two parralell universes is good, and the way it was managed - expressed before in numerous books - was still accomplished in an interesting way.In addition, thr characters were well done. It's almost impossible to write about a super-genius effectively (without boring your audience, or confusing them), but Wen managed to do it. Some of the other characters are interesting enough stereotypes to compel true interest.The plot was very fast-moving, and again creative. It changed directions several times, and was difficult to anticipate.Overall, a very creative book and a good read."
3,Yet Another Special (fill in the blank),"Not sure why women (Spencer & Patricia Briggs) think female heroes should be feisty and tough, and yet melt when confronted with an alpha male (werewolf or elf).The idea is interesting - mixing alternate worlds, magic, and science - and the execution is workmanlike, but the characters and situations are formula: brilliant heroine (a very special person - I would love to see an ordinary person hero for a change) without any common sense in peril from villians bent on world conquest. And some of the language is straight out of romance novels (bodice rippers) - if I see ""rippling muscles"" one more time I'll scream."
1,don't be deceived by comparisons to Buffy,"... although the main character, Tinker, is (occasionally) resourceful and occasionally so stupid it makes you wince (handing weapons over to enemies, totally trusting despite warnings etc.), there is a fairly graphic gangrape/bestial rape sequence quite near the end of the book, totally gratuitous and unnecessary to the plot. Readers who enjoy books that have empowered female characters, or who simply are not entertained by graphic rape scenes, will want to avoid this book."
1,Started off great . . .fizzled out fast,"I read the first four chapter on BEAN and thought . . .WOW! got the HB and about chapter six was wondering what had happened. Not nearly enough time is spent building up the characters. There's an abrupt and totally unexplained bit of 'elf soft porn' between Tinker and 'Windwolf', followed quickly by an almost rape by Tinkers friend and almost lover 'Nathen'. And it all happens simply because the author wanted it. NOT, as far as I can tell, out of any internal logic. The entire story seem to be like this, bits and pieces stuck together at random. A bit of fantasy here, some SF jargon there, a dash of soft-porn here, mix quickly with some mystery and half-bake for 340 pages.What a shame. This had the start of a great story. Instead it's a mish-mash of almost this and nearly that but not a complete story in the lot."
5,Tinker,"This story is so good!! Perfect transaction. I had to buy it, I originally borrowed it from my brother and bought myself my own copy, then the 2nd book that goes with it too. I just love this storyline!! Thank you Wen Spencer!!!!"
3,Confusing but page turning,Maybe I was mistaken when I thought you could read this book as a stand alone book? I felt like I was missing half the story through out the book. I hate when I feel the need to reread things over and over to make sure I was understanding what was going on or what was trying to be explained. This book had way too much information for me to wrap my head around. As I said I may have missed several books leading up to this and I'm wrong about it being a first in the series. If it is a first in the series be ready for a heavy read book. Loved the parts that were slow paced or easy reading but other parts were just overwhelming to me. Loved Tinker and Windstorm. Overall good read just not one of my favorites.
4,Excellent fantasy world,Really enjoyed the premise of the story and blend of fantasy and scientific theories which gave the fantasy belivability. Recommended by Catherine Asaro who is one of my faviorite authors. Book lived up to her recommendation.
5,To awesome for words!,"I first fell for Wen Spencer with her Ukiah Oregon series and it was cemented with her Tinker series. Bloody amazing author with fantastic stories.You will fall in love with Tinker and join her on roller coaster of a ride that is her life. Just hold on tight because you will feel like you have run a gauntlet and been tossed around, upside down and inside out before coming to a gasping stop with one thought ringing through your head ""Lets do it again!"".Buy them all and buy them now."
5,WOW!,"I despise sci-fi that's more science than fiction, more tech than plot but Wen Spencer delivers with a bang. Tinker, a barely eighteen year old genius, is naive enough and brassy enough to grab your attention and keep it. I thought I had gotten a book I could take my time with and found that I finished it in one night. If you like fantasy, romance, sci-fi or just a good romp this book has all the elements to keep you reading. I hope that we can revisit old Pitt again to see Oilcan or even Rikki again. It would be fun to see Tinker wrap her brain around magic instead of quantum physics. The possibilites make me drool...."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"I just finished Tinker by Wen Spencer, and it was fantastic!!! I actually rate it up there as one of my 5 favorite books, ranking it up there with 1632, Ender's Game, The Stand and Path of the Fury (rounding out my top five in no particular order).The book was great because it had all of those thing that I feel a book needs to stand out: a cool and/or unique storyline, excellent characters, good action, unpredictability, a bit of comic relief, and also a small amount of erotica, which I feel is a real necessity in books.Brent Snyder"
3,Mary Sue tongue-in-cheek,"I made it through the book mainly because I didn't really have anything else to read.The characters are at best 2 dimensional. Tinker is a ""Mary Sue"": able to out-smart everyone, can do anything, wins against all odds, and of course gets to glom onto the main hunk of the story.Fantasy and science fiction is not so much melded together as slammed together and then a sledge hammer used to make them stick. I suspect a whole case of Superglue was also needed.And it contains what so many authors in Urban fantasy with elves/vamps/werewolves/whatever seem to feel has to be in there: the sex scenes from bedroom and rapes.As long as you put your mind in neutral and don't try to make sense of the world or demand characters with depth, it's probably not a bad book for something like a long plane trip or such."
4,Gnostics Can't Be Easily Written Off,"There is a temptation among ""Christians"" today to totally write off the ""gnostics"" becasue they were heretics....which, in reality, means they""they thought differently from the way do...we are right..so they must be wrong...""This is not an easy book to read, but it does offer keen insight into the early days of the church, the politics--and there were politics--in putting the Bible together, what was in, what was out.Chapters on The Apostle's Creed are exceptional. You will never look at the Apostle's Creed again the same way...it is a much a political statement as it is a statement of faith...Not an easy book, but a good book...well worth the read...."
5,God Within,"Revealing look at Christianity's gnostic/esoteric teachings. I wish she would have also delved into Christianity's (Masonry's?) solar foundation. For example, the gospel story is a celestial allegory (an astronomical tale). More precisely, the bible is filled with astrotheology (masonic theology?). The Christ Conspiracy and Brotherhood of the Sun are also excellent reads."
3,A good introductory text,"This is a decent intro text on the Gnostic gospels with some good background information...pretty light reading all-around. After reading this I would probably check out Stephan Hoellers latest ""Gnosis: A New Light"" and the Nag Hammadi Library. Also Bentley Laytons ""Gnostic Scriptures"" is excellent. For more modern Gnostic texts, I would suggest ""The Seven Sermons to the Dead"" by Carl Jung, translated by Stephan Hoeller, and ""The Holy Fire of St. Michael"" by Richard Michael Willoughby, a modern Gnostic poet/cleric. William Blakes works are also highly recommended."
3,good for starting out,"'The Gnostic Gospels' is a very general look at the history of the gnostics and the beginnings of Christianity. If you are curious and just beginning the search into what gnosticism is about then this is a good book (as I was when I read this book), but if you are already somewhat knowledgable then this book is too simple for you. Do not read this book if you are a hard-core Bible-thumping Christian for you will find it offensive."
2,Nothing Profound,"I think most of the reviews are correct in their analysis of this book. I was expecting a lot more. I was very dissapointed that Elaine Pagels didnt deconstruct the Gnostic Gospels at a level on par with other historicist when analyzing the documents. It is absolutely rediculous to lump all of these Gospels together assuming they all form a ubiquitous worldview / belief. This is totally untrue. There is more diversity among these Gospels (say for instance between the Gospel of Thomas and Clement) than there is between modern Christian demominations. Some of these gospels veiw the actions of matter (i.e. sex) as an evil in this world which Pagels fails to condend or explain. Atleast Pagals does openly admit her biases.. and I think she deserves credit for this. Too many academics want to be portayed as 'objective', but I think we can all atest that untrue of everything in reality."
3,From A Christian Perspective,"I disagree on some of the authors interpretations of Biblical Scripture; however, the author attempts to present the facts in an unbiased manner."
1,The Gnostic Gospels (Vintage),"This is a misrepesentation of the Gospels. It should be noted that this is not a translation of the Gnostic Gospel. It is merely The authors viewpoints and excerps from the original text.Which, by the way, has been translated.I was under the impression that this was the tranlated Gnostic Bibles. This book should be clearly titled ""My thoughts of the Gnostic text"".Don't bother ordering this book if you are looking for the Gnostic Bible translated."
1,Shows how old New Age thought is.,"Yawn.Old hat new age regurgitated for the gullible. Read it along with ""The Gnostic Scriptures"". It certainly beats LSD.On the other hand, if you want to understand early christianity, try reading Irenaeus of Lyons, Clement of Rome, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Ignatius of Antioch - you know, Christians."
1,Absurd Revisionist History,"Though I am not a Christian, I profess that this attempt to revise history is based on this author's hate for Christianity. It has no real facts contained within and only cites obscure heretical groups as its source. Being an obvious Christian hater, this author flames away with drawn and spurious conclusions and severe revisionism is written as if it were really true."
1,"It's a fiction work, but selling itself as true.","It's all fiction, and nothing from here is remotely true or can be proven, it's fiction, but when I bought this book, it was sold in the religion section of the library. Ba warned !"
5,Great Read,"This book is great for understanding why the bible has what it has in it and why many things were left out. A great read before diving into all the lost gospels and scrolls. I feel it is important to understand the politics present at the time the bible was being edited to find truths for yourself and to understand why you have to look elsewhere for some other things Jesus wanted us to know. There is much to sort through in the lost gospels and this book helps you get a foundation for understanding the conflicts between gnostics and ""orthodox"" so you can begin to make sense of the sometimes competitive and even passionately contrasting teachings and philosophies."
3,This book will teach you about knowledge.,"This books describes an early Christian sect. This book does not approach Christianity in a traditional sense. But, it does revive some of the early Christian spirituality, which is essential for living in today's world. This book teaches the reader about knowledge from a very new Christian point of view."
5,Elaine Pagels is a genius,Elaine Pagels is a genius. Amazing studies of the roots of Christianity. I recommend any book she has written. This will give you lots to think about. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
2,not an easy read,You really got to be into this. Not an easy or enjoyable read. Would not recommend youwaste your time.
5,Elaine Pagels Presents the Gnostic Gospels.,"Elaine Pagels does a fine job in presenting the reader with the historical context surrounding the discovery of the Gnostic Gospels, and the ""intrigue"" that resulted in the tracking down of some that were sold to collectors, as well as the 30 years it took to publish them in a translated form. She also does a fine job in giving the reader a fine sense of the historical context in which the Gnostic Gospels were written, and why they were ""hushed"" up by the Roman Catholic tradition. This is a fascinating book that any Christian should read, as one can get a new sense of who Jesus was, and why Christianity ended up being the way it is now, and how it could benefit more from these early traditions and rites of the early Church."
3,hmm,"This book was the third Pagels that i read and i think the weakest. I don't understand how it won the Pulitzer Prize and is on the Modern Library 100 non-fiction list.It was interesting. I would say, though, that if you read Adam, Eve, and the Serpent and The Origin of Satan, Ms Pagels abilities become much more alive as she becomes much more focused in using the gnostic texts to analyze a specific issue in the history of christianity.I would not recomend reading this book after reading those two, but if you want a good summary of some of the ideas of the gnostics it is a good book.It is important to note that though Ms. Pagels is a practicing christian, this view does not enter a word of this text, or any other text she has written. She tries to take an objective perspective but it comes out to me overly secularized in trying to find fault with any and all orthodox beliefs, no matter the base."
4,The Gnostic Gospels,Well written and informative. Good explanation of the political intrigue of the early church.
5,A Groundbreaking Work,"Elaine Pagels works are all well worth reading. However, The Gnostic Gospels takes the reader back in time and reveals to the reader the issues that exercised the minds of the early Christians, and eventually divided them.You'll learn how Gnostic lack of hierarchial structure and early Catholic hierarchal structure were the determining factors in how the early Church chose to dogmatize a belief in a physical resurrection of Jesus.Many surprises, treats, and insights await those who read this book with an open mind and heart.Nate[...]"
2,Very disappointing.,When I purchased this book I was expecting to see an actual interpretation of the Gnostic Gospels not read a story. When I got The Gospel of Thomas some years ago that's what I got (the gospel in English) so when I saw this I was really excited to be able to read the rest of them. Unfortunately all I got was her giving me a history lesson. Yes she actually does quote the gospels throughout the book but in no way is this a book with the Gnostic gospels in it. I can't say I received nothing - I get something out of children's books when I read them - but what I came for I did not get. Reading Meyer's interpretation of The Gospel of Thomas and having to actually think about what the gospel said gave me much more insight into the real Jesus as well as expanding the inner me. This book in no way expanded my consciousness and that's what I bought it for. This was a huge disappointment. If you are expecting to actually get to read the gospels this is not the place to go.
3,FAIR BOOK,"A LITTLE OVER YOUR HEAD IN SOME PART, NEEDS TO BE MORE ON A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL INSTEAD OF COLLEGE, BUT ENJOYED IT"
4,A Good Beginining to an Understanding of Early Christianity,"If you want a good, lucid, well-written overview of the beginnings of Christianity, this book is what you need. It concerns the early struggle for the ""correct"" Christian message, and Pagels does a good job of intertwining the political, social, psychological, and philosophical strands of thre early Christian world together to produce a good picture of the fight over whose message would finally be canonical."
3,Rejected... NOT surpressed....,"To agree with one reviewer and educate another.... These gospels were rejected because of their questionable authority. While the four biblical gospels are the truth. If there is any question about the trustworthiness of the bible ( historically speaking ) then you shoud read "" EVIDENCE THAT DEMANDS A VERDICT & MORE EVEDENCE THAT DEMANDS A VERDICT- Josh McDowell "" these books will quickly dispell what is the truth. But i gave this book 3 stars because it was an interesting read... though off base some."
3,Nobody is obliged to believe it.,"Some of the negative reviews seem to assume that Pagels is trying to get people to BELIEVE in a revived Gnosticism; I wonder if they read the book all the way through to the end and read the last chapter where she says quite the reverse.Up to now, most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies; the Nag Hammadi Documents have given us a chance to hear the Gnostics in their own words.To read and study these texts and to present their contents is not necsssarily to believe them oneself, or to advocte that others do. Rather, it is to get a broader insight into the intellectual life of the early church; one can understand better what the Church Fathers were trying to accomplish in their writings if one has some knowledge and appreciation of what they were responding to. The book is useful in this way.The reason I have given it a low mark is that if the book can be so misinterpreted, then the author must not have been writing all that clearly."
4,Gnostic Gospels as it relates to Christianity,"Elaine Pagels, a religion professor, discusses the effects the Gnostic gospels have had on Christianity since their discovery in 1945. She explains the gospels view of the life and teachings of Jesus, which differs from that of the New Testament, and deliberates questions raised. Though a well-written book and worth reading, this book does not contain a translation of the Gnostic Gospels."
1,Waste of time,"I really enjoyed another of Gutcheon's books, so I thought I might like this one, as well. However, I found the characters to be drawn with very broad strokes, too stereotypical to be believable . Story-lines were started and dropped. Traumatic events happened too late in the story to be properly developed. The book seemed like a series of notes that were not well strung together. The characters and overall feeling of the book was mean-spirited, and the conclusion came about through no direct action of the protagonists. This book was very disappointing and a waste of time."
3,Too many stories going on,"Too many characters to keep straight, teachers, parents, kids, temporary help, ex-spouses and their new spouses, and too many small stories going on at school.Unexplained events were confusing, such as, Mike, the assistant head, who at the beginning was described as gay and a single father. Then, toward the end, he marries the school counselor. It seemed as if that was a marriage of convenience for Bonnie, who was being sent home to Canada because she had no green card. But if that's the case, it wasn'tmade clear. Nor was it clear if Henry and Emily had an affair.Rue's and Henry's relationship was warm and wonderful and humorous, despite their setbacks."
3,Started out as a real-life tale of an independent school but,"Saying Grace, in dealing with the real life problems and triumphs of an independent school, isa partially accurate appraisal of the characters and situations encountered in this type of institution. The problem is that Gutcheon wrenches every possible rabbit out of the hat of private education. As a teacher in an independent school for 22 years, I recognized each agonizing event and character Headmistress Shaw encountered and flinched when each abyss unfolded for her. It was truly ""independent overkill""."
2,"Basis for a good story, but poorly written","Being a teacher, I was able to relate to the situations that Rue and the teachers dealt with day to day. This is what I enjoyed most about the book. I also enjoyed learning about the individual characters, but found myself not getting to know them very well. I don't think Ms. Gutcheon's use of the English language was very effective. The writing was choppy at times, and it contained some flowery words that were used incorrectly and ineffectively."
5,awesome,"Our 3 year old daughter got one of these for Christmas from her uncle. She turns four in 2 months and is now riding a two-wheeler, courtesy of her experience with the like-a-bike! Awesome product - especially if you want your little one to learn how to ride a ""real"" bike!!! I fully anticipate her brothers learning even earlier!!!"
5,Great toy!,"While the walking bike is great, we were disappointed that the vendor send us the wrong (cheaper) Forest instead of the ordered Mountain version. Since it was too close to christmas when we received the shipping, we had no chance to exchange it."
5,Never need training wheels!,"I purchased this bike about 3 years ago for a bit less than it is now. My first son used it at age 3 and was riding a regular bike without ever using training wheels by the time he turned four. My second son used it around 2 1/2 (both my boys are slightly taller than average) and was riding a regular bike without ever using training wheels by 3 1/2. Very well built bike, it is now with their cousin so she can learn to ride. Never needed anything fixed on it, tires never need air so even though it is expensive it is well worth it. When children get used to these types of bikes, they cruise very quickly on them and in my experience transition to a regular bike in about a day or two."
5,Boys love it!,This is a great bike. My boys love it more than any other toy/bike we own. It's the hot item at our house! We would love to get the 'midi' now that our oldest is almost 5.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I am very pleased with this product, it is exactly what I was looking for. Very pleased with this purchase."
5,C'est un excellent cours de francais.....,"pour ceux qui deja le parle. Si vous deja comprendez que francais est tres difficile, comme les autres langues de etranger, vous pouvez utiliser cet cours. Il n'y a pas facile facon d'apprendre le francais sauf ecoute, ecoute, ecoute. Cet cours vous donne le meilleur chemin a vrai francais parce que nous avons besoin ecoute, ecoute, ecoute! Les parleurs sont Francais et Francaise et ils parlent trop vite. On peut apprendre plus vite par ecoute, ecoute, ecoute. On doit etre un auditeur avant un parleur. Si vous etes serieux en apprendre le francais vous vous amuseriez avec cet cours autant que j'avais. Au revoir."
2,"""Expert Advice"" from someone on Disney's payroll!!","Steve Birnbaum's book serves a purpose...for those who have never been to Disney, and want an overview of Disney, then this book is fine. But beware! Everything that you read makes it sound as though you can never eat a bad meal, you can never stay in a bad room...that everything about Disney is PERFECT!! This is not the case!!! If you want to know what things are REALLY like at Disney, then go for another book, like the Passporter (which is a great guidebook to help you organize your trip!) or The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World.There you will read reviews of others who have stayed at the hotel you might be considering, they've eaten at the restaurant you are contemplating (and they will tell you whether it's worth it or not!) If you want to get a real feel of what Disney is like, then don't buy this one!"
2,Get the Unoffical Guide instead!,"Anyone who gave this more than three stars at most has probably never read ""The Unofficial Guide"". I got both prior to our vacation and hardly used this book (although I cross-checked it constantly to see if it had anything to add - it didn't). If you want to spend money on an over-inflated Disney brochure, and value glossy pictures over objective advice, this could be the book for you. If you're only going to get one Disneyworld guide, don't make it this one."
3,Good but found lacking,"This newest version of Birnbaum's guide is good and very helpful. For a source of information it is top notch. I was dissapointed to find that it lacks solid recommendations in the lodging department. The info is there, but they do not tell you what they think is the best. So I am back where I started, trying to figure out where I should stay on my visit."
2,Reads Like a (Too Long) Ad,"I'm sorry I purchased this particular guide; dense with information, much of it ""puffy,"" the author never met a Disney experience he didn't like. Even his menus for time-pressed visitors list too many rides and events. There's three paragraphs on everything you want two sentences on. I also found myself going back and forth between sections, it's not organized clearly and concisely. Overall, though, the big drawback is it's not a critical look at the park."
5,Great Book For Your Disney Vacation,I found this book very helpful on planning my vacation. It has great tips and information on all the parks and resorts. Anyone planning a Walt Disney World vacation definetly should purchase this book.
4,Official? or Unofficial?,"well, I have found that in the Official books, they don't say a bad thing about Disney. In the Unofficial, the tell their opinions, and others. If your looking for a guide book go to the library and get this out, and also, get a unofficial book too, just to get a better idea."
3,Why does he always do this??,"The serise starts out great and then with each passing installment it falls into decline. We see proud charecters like Sam Yeager reduced to sinziling trators and Great Generals like the fleet lord Alvtar reduced to ginger sniffers.Tuttledove as an author has always suffered from the inability to wrap up what he writes. It happened in The Great War Serise, It happened in Striking The Balance and it happened in this one. Don't know why I expected anything more. SC"
3,oh but this is not the end.,"Just when you hoped for some closure, the book is left with an ending that clearly leaves open an new series. The new series will revolve around the attack on the lizards home planet. So if you pick up this book thinking it will come to an end, good luck. Absolutely no resolution to be had. sorry."
4,aftershocks,"I like his stories of alternate history,but his writing is toostereotyped The same type of phrases occur time and time again,and this detracts from the storyline.I have read many of his books and I can almost predict what anindividual is going to say at a given time."
4,great book-is the saga truly over?,"This book is absolutely great along with the previous books in the series, even though it lacks the action present in the world war series. And best of all this books conclusion definitely leaves room for more book's to continue the saga."
3,Aftershocks is So-So,"The latest installment of Harry Turteldove's Colonization series was decent but did not live up to its predecessors, especially, Down to Earth. I thought the climax came about half way through the book and the last half was not very exciting. The characters seemed to run around in circles at the end. Plus one character is arrested, gets out of jail, and suddenly is back in jail needing help to get out. Was that a slip or am I just dense? I was amused though to see my hometown play a prominent roll in the book. All in all, not his best book."
2,Colonization - Lightest Aftershocks Imaginable,"How is it that a book can take 600 pages or thereabouts to take you on a ride that goes nowhere? I scored this book as 2 stars rather than one because I believe it takes considerable stringing-along skill to maintain the deception of progress for such a duration, hence one point for the book and one, with a tip of my hat for such, er, technique.Not only that but the story finishes, if such a word can be used, with more loose ends than a mop. As I was nearing the end of the novel, with maybe 50 pages to go, I was thinking ""wow, it's going to be exciting to see how this gets wrapped up - any page now, something big is going to happen!"". Then there were 30 pages left, then 20, then... well, I got this sinking feeling. Which proved to be well founded.Will there be yet another trilogy? Frankly I no longer care."
2,Could have been better,"This was supposed to be the ""concluding"" work in this series, but it really shouldn't be. There wasn't enough meat in this installment; very little actually happens, as opposed to several of the worldwar books. For those of you familiar with the rest of the series, many of the more interesting characters are already dead or are killed off in this book, and many of the more trite and tiresome ones get starring roles (please, Harry, drop a huge atom bomb on the Yeagers already). This book should have gone farther; the series really won't feel complete until the timeline passes ours and the Race's home planet becomes involved in the story. Hopefully, there will be one more book in this series, with a significantly faster pace - the idea behind the series will support it."
2,nothing much new,"I really looked forward to this one. But it so similar to the last one, very little new major plot work, lots of repeats of small plots. Nothing much happens new , this is like a tv miniseries that is being dragged out. Hope the next is better."
3,A mediocre rush job,"While I reading this book I was not sure that it was a conclusion of a trilogy or the third of four books. Having read it I am still not sure. The loose threads have pretty much been sown up but there no real plot or final resolution. It left me wanting more but I am not sure there anywhere a fourth book can go really. The ending I find painfully predictable. The book had a feel of a rush job, like resolving the mystery of the Lewis and Clark on the last page as an aside in a conversation! Please! How anticlimatic! What happened to building the tension? I felt like I eating thin soup. Again I got the feeling that Turtledove wanted to finish this book so he could move to other things. In a couple places in the last few chapters the writing style and grammar are awkward as if even teh prrofreader was geeting tired. The reason I gave it three stars and not lower is that the series is a great premise and if you loved the series you should read it, but wait for the paperback."
5,love this book and everything about the series,"There has been much criticism of this book and series from other Amazon.com reviewers. I must say I found this book as interesting and riveting as the other books in the series. I definitely hope there is a sequel coming, because this is such a fascinating world to lose yourself in."
1,Nothing Happens,"Once you are hooked on a series, they seem to assume that you will buy anything, and this is a good example. This is supposed to be alternative history, but it it instead a sci-fi soap opera. There is no plot, just gossip about characters who are not doing anything of interest.This could have been handled with a 12 page epilogue at the end of the last book.One good thing about these tiring series -- they usually are available at the library so you don't have to waste your money on them."
2,"Oh god, please let it end.","This series is already long overdue for a conclusion. The last chapter should have been in the middle.All the fuss over the American's being responsible for taking out an invading starship -- one that brings with it the manufacturing and other production capabilities to allow the lizards to maintain a strong position indefinitely -- is utterly absurd.I'll give him one more try. If this next one is not the end, I'm not going to bother."
5,Inexpensive but great addition for your viewing pleasure,"This particular Barlow, along with the Orion Shorty, is highly recommended on several of the astronomy forums on the internet. I got this one instead of the Orion simply because Amazon was offering it at about $52 at the time.I've found that I enjoy using the Barlow when viewing planets and a few DSO's. It provides an economical way to virtually increase the number of eyepieces in your collection. It does introduce a little light loss with my eyepieces (maybe this is normal with all eyepieces), but it is not troublesome.I certainly recommend this Barlow for those of you who want to cheaply expand your eyepiece collection."

3,A Must for Jack Lemmon Fans,"A few days prior to buying this DVD on Amazon, I had purchased a copy of it at a local store, or so I thought. Due to a misprint of the actual DVD itself I ended up with a copy of an earlier Lemmon classic named ""Pffft!"" with Judy Holliday and Kim Novak. Although mildly entertaining, it found ""Pffft!"" disappointing overall. I decided to take a chance and purchase the DVD I wanted online. Once it arrived, I found that it was the correct film that I wanted. ""The Notorious Landlady"" was an enjoyable comedy centered around a newly assigned young American diplomat in London (Lemmon) who finds himself in a compromising position when he rents a room from a woman (Kim Novak) who has been accused of murdering her now-missing husband. Despite pressure from his boss (Fred Astaire) to move to another flat and avaoid a possible scandle, Lemmon's character is more interested in proving the innocence of his landlady as he finds himself falling in love with her..."
3,Be careful about this...,"T-Fal is a reliable non-stick product, and the pan works great, though always with a little oil. The danger is in picking the thing up. If it is full of any liquid type sauce or heavy with meat, it is very tippy. My husband almost ""lost the load"" several times when picking this pan up by the handle. Best to use a hot pad and hold one side, as well as the handle, when moving this pan at all. It could be dangerous for spilling hot contents, so watch out."
1,Buy something else.,Within 1 month the Pan turned inwards and it is very hard to clean if you use oil on the pan. They say that you have to clean with a sponge but that doesn't work.Cleaning and cooking on the Pan is extremely difficult. So don't buy this product. When I approached the company with the problem they refused to help me.In fact I sent the Pan to them for review and they sent the exact same Pan back to me saying they cannot do anything about it. So that means I wasted on posted too.For that price I could have bought another pan which was not taken into consideration by them at all.Not a a good buy at all.........I bought cuisinart product once which was defective and all I did is made a call and they sent me a new one FREE without any questions Now tell me why would I buy T-fal products when there are companies like Cuisinart they bought me as their customer.
4,"Still using it, 7 years later","I bought this pan in 2003 and it's still a part of my kitchen. I've not had any issues with it - no peeling of the coating, and have found it easy to clean. It's a very basic 13-inch pan and has no great features, but it lasts. For a family of 2 though, it is pretty large, so I do not use it as often as I use my 8 and 10-inch pans."
1,George never takes responsibility,"This book doesn't enforce any of the values I'm trying to instill in my child. Not only is George curious, he also steals, runs away to avoid being caught, and when he is finally reprimanded for one of his many wrongdoings, all is forgiven due to his status and usefulness. This book may teach a child about how the world IS, but it certainly does not teach of how it SHOULD BE. No doubt kids enjoy the adventures of this little monkey, but we must ask ourselves what values it teaches our children."
3,LACKING,"This CD was basically good, but was seriously lacking in other Desi Arnez songs. I have found it difficult to find a good collection of Desi Arnez music."
4,A very good Cadfael movie,"This is a very good movie. The story is true to the book, and I really liked the book. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because a few of the memorable lines from the book that were spoken by characters other than Cadfael were split up in the movie so that he completed some of them. For example, when the crowd comes chasing after the minstrel Lilliwin, it really was more appropriate for the ABBOT to say, ""Put up your weapons or court your soul's damnation."" I think it would have been presumptious for a lay brother to say such a thing unless he was an ordained priest, who had the power to excommunicate. But other than that, the movie was as good as the book in every respect, and it's worth seeing."
3,Just not as good as TD,"The good doctor's second work just isn't up to the standard of TD. Dr. Pierce attempts to get more ideology and support for the ideology into the book which makes parts of it read like a political pamphlet. Being an NA member I found myself familiar with all the arguments and found myself skipping over large parts of it trying to get back into the story line. The over all story line was good, however Dr. Pierce sacrificed developing the characters and the plot to put the huge sections on why jews are what jews are. I also think it could have done without the sex, which served no purpose. TD is still the reigning king of modern racialist fiction."
3,"Interesting to read, but not that great",This book is certainly not as good as The Turner Diaries. It started out good but took a wrong turn somewhere. Less sex would have been helpful to this book. I really don't know what Pierce was thinking when he included those passages. What could have been a great instrument in the cause turned out to be a waste of time.Although there were interesting parts I would not consider reading it again. I guess I was hoping for another Turner Diaries from the late Dr. Pierce.
1,and we wonder why this worls in such bad shape,I am a 23 year old U.S marine i read this book after reading the turnner diarys out of pure interest. I could not believe what i read whatever could make people think that this was the way to get rid of evil in the world have no clue what they are talking about.This book leaves you with many questions from a very troubled man. If anything i hope to god the world does not come to voilence like i read in this book.its peopel like him that make me worried about what this world is coming to.If anything this book proved that racisim is a stupid idea as well as white supremecy some of the greatist men and women that i work with are blacks a jews ...pease outsgt kathy fillips us
5,Great album!,I happened to stumble across this album and artist. I feel so lucky I did. Jorge Drexler composition and music are superb. I will highly recommend anybody to buy from this great artist.
5,Un gran Artista,"Tengo que admitir que no conocia mucho de su musica, me parecia algo aburrida, pero que equivocado estaba yo y tengo que pedir disculpas,, Es una gran artista muy talentoso, el primer disco que compre fue ""doce segundos en la obscuridad"" es estupendo trabajo, si El lee los mensajes dejados aqui, quiero decirle que lo admiro y soy su fan para siempre,,"
5,Beautiful!,"I first knew of Jorge Drexler with 'Al Otro Lado Del Rio' from the Motorcycle Diaries. When I saw this on sale, I couldn't resist and I absolutely love this disc!"
2,Suite for Teachers...hmmm,"I am a new teacher and very much into technology; I use my Treo 650 for everything else and decided...why not for work? I purchased and downloaded this software, thinking, this WILL make my life easier.After previewing and using the software, I realized not too long after that something really important was missing. There was no place to capture or measure student grades!!! Very dissappointing...how can this package have an application to remember the names and schedules of other teachers, but no grading system? Very dissappointing...how can this package have application to note methods of discipline and no grading system?I think the writers went into a great deal of detail without remembering to handle an essential basic...grading.Teacher's P.E.T is cheaper and looks like it helps to grade, moitor student attendance and keep records of pertinent student info!"
3,"A few gems, worth the price","I'd love to have a CD full of all the great songs sung by Sheriff Andy Taylor-- at the courthouse, on the porch, or in some hillbilly cabin... but at least this has 4 good bluegrass songs, and I do recall one from an episode (New River Train)-- and for the low price that seems OK. The instrumental theme music is interesting, too, evoking subconsious connections to the show. There's a long story, too-- a backwoods-flavored fairy tale-- that showcases Griffith's oratorical gifts, but didn't bear up to repeat listening."
5,The most important character is the music.,"Absolutely - this music sets the mood, provides a ""sence"" of the moment, sometimes covers the movement of props, and generally steals without anyones notice. Excellent and right on point!"
4,Essential purchase for fans of The Andy Griffith Show,"I absolutely love this CD, being a life-long fan of the series. The incidental music included here, ""Ellie's Theme"", ""The Man Hunt"", ""Mayberry March"", and the tear-inducing ""Aunt Bee"" all bring back fond memories of this classic 60's series, maybe the best TV show of all time. My only complaint about the album is the sequencing, which I assume is the original sequencing. For instance, track #2 is the 8 and a half minute comedy monologue by Andy called ""Jack, The Giant Killer"", which would work better, IMO, near the end of the CD. I have resequenced my CD-R copy of this disc with the first 6 tracks being: 1. The Andy Griffith Show 2. Ellie's Theme 3. The Man Hunt 4. Flop Eared Mule 5. Mayberry March 6. Aunt Bee. These tracks are the very best on the CD and best represent the mood of the show. At any rate, at the low price Amazon has this CD here, you must have this in your collection if you're a fan of Andy & the show."
5,The Andy Griffith Show music is great!,"We really enjoy this CD of the music of Mayberry. It's funny and entertaining, just as the TV sitcom itself is. What a talented performer Andy Griffith was. His recent passing was a sad loss to the entertainment world. I would recomment this CD to anyonw who enjoyed the TV show and appreciates good clean entertainment with a country theme."
1,Sigma 28-200 Zoom,The lens feels balanced. But the sharpness of distant objects at the maximum zoom level is not acceptable. The lens failed to focus after six months of light use. I do not recommend it.
3,A descent lens for the price,"I have had this lens for about 3-4 years, I have not had any prblems with the focus, It is well balanced and solid. Focus at the long end is a bit soft"
1,WAY TOO LARGE,"These sucked. I wear a small in everything. so i ordered these in a small, and they were like balloon pants that went all the way up to my chest! worst buy from internet, ever."
4,Exactly as advertised,"The pants fit well, look decent, are reasonably priced, and are comfortable. I bought the royal blue color because there are so many grey, black, and dark blue options... and this is a bit more bold."
5,Gildan Pocket Sweatpants,Sweatpants are very nice and comfortable to wear around the house. Really enjoy them. Thanks.
3,Not bad for a quick start,"This book gives a lot of usefull information about a lot of MBA programs, but I found a lack of top ten U.S. schools. Some of them are missing, there is a huge gap between the best schools and those ranked below. (Some of them are ranked below #100).I prefer this book than browsing the net because at a glance you can have interesting information of many, many MBA's and the information is well organized. GMAT means, ratio applications/accepted, strong subjects, deadlines, number or students, main features, % of student body, all the basic information to get to know what an MBA may you offer and wheter it's appealing depending on your targets.The europen chapter is better than anyone. The U.S. chapter is not wide enough, but not bad.If you are deciding to which MBA you should apply, this book will help you to shorten your starting list and focus on 10 to 12 MBA programs. Then which one to choose it's up to you"
1,Defective tool,"This seemed like a reasonable tool for the first 10 minutes (literally) I used it, and then the fork broke off. I've had other spading forks which have bent, but this one sheared off cleanly. Amazon couldn't have been better about the return, but I wouldn't give it a second try."
1,A very poor quality fork.,The first time that I used this fork the handle snapped at the top of the metal sleeve above the tines. The fiberglass stopped above the metal sleeve and very thin wood joined handle to tines.The vendor requested that I e-mail photographs and promptly refunded the total price paid. I replaced it with one from Sears.
4,great gift,I actually bought this for my older children (ages 25 to 32) because they are always doing things like thumb wars. The thought it was hilarious and I caught them playing with it several times throught the day.
5,5 stars for Natalie only!,Where is the rest of the mini series?! This VHS has been cut to shreds! Of course it has my darling Natalie Wood in the lead in her Golden Globe winning performance and as usual she is stunning in a role originated by Deborah Kerr...it's worth the viewing just to watch Miss Wood in a performance that simply drips with sensuality and longing!
5,A facinating history of a 19th Century King of Persia,"Such insight and dedication to perfection is difficult to find. This is a fascinating book on the life of a Qajar Monarch that ruled Persia for one half of the 19th century. You will learn a great deal about how the era of industrial colonialism pushed an otherwise mighty and ancient empire into a defensive position that just keeping the nation in one piece became a major accomplishment. The life of the Nassir Al-Din Shah Qajar is so well depicted in this book that you live in 19th century Iran while reading it. A scholarly work of history by Professor Amanat that is a true contribution to Middle Eastern, Russian, and British History."
5,Blues with a little jazz. That! greated.,"I've being following Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown from the 60's. He played behind Freddie King on show call The Beat!!! in Taxas. I will be happy to see someone from The Beat!!!. Put footages of Z.Z. Hill and Joe Simon on DVDs form The Beat!!!. GET RICH!"
3,"""ENOUGH""","I acquired the book, ""Enough"", based partly on my respect for its author,Juan Williams - an articulate and knowledgeable guy. Although this book has good substance, Juan refuses to take 50 words to say something that he couldn't just as easily say in 500. He could easily have made this a 100 page book rather than 243 if he had cut down on the redundancy of thoughts and actual quotes. My advice - wait for the Reader's Digest version."
4,tough love for black leaders/community,"Got the book from a tip on a ""conservative"" blogers site, my own politics are much more radical. My wife and I are reading the book together (she's an inner-city middleschool teacher) and we find it on the mark. Too many non-parenting ""parents"" leave our youngsters will no role models or values that contribute to society. Babies-having-babies, ""no dads around syndrome"" leaves the black community socially dysfunction. the author uses Bill Cosby's talk as a starting point. I've only read the first 3 chapters so I haven't seen the ""solutions part"" as yet.I highly recommend this book. It's 20 years late but better late than unwritten."
4,The Answer to the Real Problem...,"I have always thought Juan Williams was too liberal, but he furnishes some reasoned balance to the arguments among the all-stars, and at the least, he is entertaining.This book took a lot of guts to write. The entrenched ""leaders"" of Black America were truly shot out of the saddle by Bill Cosby, and Williams has written a nice summary of this big event for all of us. Would that all Americans might wake up to the real solution to the problem Williams has carefully defined.The book is well worth reading."
3,Good condition but long delivery.,Book was in good condition when received but took a long time to be delivered.
1,Sound and Fury,"Full disclosure: I am a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male, and should be expected to be sympathetic to Mr. Williams' concerns. As indeed I am. But I don't think this book makes a very useful guide into or out of the labyrinth of pain that is the state of black America today. Mr. williams is a personable and able radio and television reporter. But a writer he is not. His book is a screed, a prolix, disorganized, and repetitious rant, that seems to serve the purpose of releasing Williams' frustrations, and little else. I would recommend John McWhorter's ""Losing the Race"" for a much more provocative and thoughtful investigation of these dilemmas,"
1,Trash,"Juan William's worshipful paean to Bill Cosby is proof that class trumps race in America, or to put it another way, the rich are neither white nor black, they are green. Juan's book, with its attacks on alleged `black culture' problems could easily have been written by David Duke, whose racist rhetoric uses similar disguise these days. Tiresome and insipid as the `blame the victim' rhetoric is, it is not as loathsome as the hero worship lauded on the undeserving Cosby, whose own childish outburst would be forgivable but for its repletion. Williams and Cosby have both become spokesman and apologists for the wealthy and the system of exploitation that is in the truth the cause of the very problems they allegedly deplore. But sophisticated analysis is an anathema to these haters. For this perspective, stick to The Dispossessed Majority whose despicable author at least has the courage of his convictions."
2,Very disappointing read,While I respect Juan Williams this book is a very disappointing read. This often angry and overly simplistic tirade is Mr. Williams' response to the response of Cosby's infamous 2004 speech. This book only exacerbates the us vs. them mentality that is currently passing itself off as meaningful dialogue within the African American community. Save your money and if you must read this book I suggest you borrow it from your local library.
1,Did Mr. Cosby hire a ghost-writer?,"I read a review for this book and decided to give it a try...I was truly disappointed. Instead of presenting a well thought out discussion of the problems plaguing the black community Mr. Williams presents a ghost written screed for Mr. Cosby. There was no insight and it was merely a patch-work collection of speeches given by Bill Cosby interspersed with commentary by Mr. Williams, I have to admit I expected more from such a prominent journalist.The book is quotation intensive but lacks basic supporting facts..and his use of folkloric stories as fact made me quite uncomfortable, and I couldn't help but think it should have made Mr. Williams a bit uneasy as well."
3,Worth a read,"I bought the book because I'd heard Juan Williams interviewed by Prof. Dyson on CSPAN. I was glad to have read the book, but thought that too much space was devoted to discussion of the problems and too little space was devoted to the solutions to those problems."
5,The True About Black America,"This is a great book that speaks to the problems in black America that have been and are still being ignored. It tells of a race of people who were and are able to overcome the most dire circumstances. Yet, they don't take advantage of the opportunities that are available today, well written Juan Williams."
4,Presenting the Obvious,"Juan Williams has produced a well-written account of exactly what is necessary to begin curing the ills of not only the black underclass, but all those mired in poverty. This is exactly the same straight-forward advice clear thinking parents would provide their children if they want them to succeed in life. The book is well-written and above all balanced. Mr. Williams consistently maintains that racism does exist. By remembering the sacrifices of civil rights leaders of the past, he praises the best in black history and reminds the current crop of leaders where to focus their efforts.There are two reasons I did not give this book a five-star rating. First, the book tends to repeat itself. Second, it comes across as too much of a defense of Bill Cosby. While I am glad that Bill Cosby is being defended, he doesn't have to be defended on every other page of the book. I would encourage Mr. Cosby to write his own book or develop his own TV or DVD series on his important message"
4,A must read for Black Americans,"As a Black American this book educated me on the exploitation of Black Americans by ""self appointed"" Black Leaders. It gave me a history of this exploitation and open ones eyes to thinking for yourself and not allowing the mental slavery of our minds by these corrupt leaders aka Jackson, Sharpton and others. We have had much progress and success in the Black Community however those whose motives are for monetary gain continue to exploit Blacks and keep them on the ""mental slave plantation""."
2,A Forgotten Gem,"When I came across this CD I bought it Instantly for ""Yolonda and the thief"". The score is a little weak (which is one of the factors of it's faliure in theaters)but one good song is ""coffee time"" a swing-type number that has well written music and is a show stopper. The songs ""angel"" and ""yolonda"" are okay, but ""this is a day for love"" is cheesy and has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. ""The fleets in"" is great for any Betty Hutton fan and it has some good upbeat numbers like ""if you build me a better mousetrap"" and ""Arthur Murry taught me a dance in a hurry"". The quality isn't too good. It sounds like someone held a tape recorder to a TV and taped it off the movie. This is probably why the price it a steal. The only way I can see one would by it is for Betty Hutton or because they are a fan off the offbeat but forgotten movie ""yolanda and the thief"" with Fred Astaire(which is my reason)."
4,Excellent cast & production,"I've loved this opera for many years and purchased this on VHS and laser disc. I agree with the other reviewer as to the cast being superb but the chorus and conducting under par and perhaps because it was broadcast on PBS. Those were the days when you could see an opera on PBS! Domingo and Verrett are magnificent and since there aren't alot of productions to choose from, this is certainly worth the price to add to your collection."
2,Opera DVD is not only to listen!,"Well, I was very cuorious about this DVD but when i finally got it...what a disappointment!The perfomance generally is very dull, the acting is boring and sometimes all lacks of director's work are obvious. They sing...rather good...but that's it. Better not see the video. When one watch the seduction scene it's rather hard to pick up how Dalila succeded to seduce Samson...kind of ridiculous. etcMore to this the sound direction of the opera is not really well-done - the voices are pulled straight very loud while the music is rather quite.2 STARS only - better choose another video of this wonderful opera. For Verrett and Domingo fans only."
5,Consumer,"I have used this product for many, many years, and there is no other on the market that gives the result that Ammens does. I can,t find it in stores in my living area, 21040. I sure hope this product doesn`t disappear. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Robert Smith"
2,Difficult to read,"Unlike standard tab books, this book has the tab on one page and the standard notation on the next page, and it's in 12/8 time! It's nearly impossible to determine if the tab notes are triplets or eigth notes or what the actual note duration is. I also saw no mention of a companion CD as another reviewer referred to. The best place to start is the Rev. Gary Davis CD Blues & Ragtime which comes with 5 standard tab notation songs transcribed in the liner notes by Stephan Grossman (several are identical to the songs in this book) but they are much easier to read and understand."
2,"Ok music, terrible lyrics","Ok, to be fair, at least Slayer are still trying to rip it up where the other big 80s thrash bands are writing insipid (...), but I can't honestly stomach some of the lyrics/vocals on this album. They're pretty infantile for a band that has been around for 20 years.Some of the music is okay, but it sounds a lot like many other bands who play this kind of music; that classic Slayer sound can barely be heard. At least the band still sound enthusiatic I suppose, so there's some chance of them producing a decent album in the future, if they take the lyric writing duties out of Kery King's hands.I can suggest any Slayer album instead of this (although Diabolus is no masterpiece either)."
5,Slayer still slaying!!,"No, it's not the Slayer of the late 80s, but that doesn't matter because 'God Hates Us All' is nothing but ""in your face, eardrum bursting"" metal! This album does carry a modern sound, but this is the kind of album that needs to be full blasted on your stereo to truly be appreciated. I don't understand why people cry about bands like Slayer evolving, because most of the time they get better this way; & 'God Hates Us All' is a true example of that!"
2,A few gems amongst a heap,"Slayer get the reputation for sticking true to their formula and not compromising their sound but this is a blatant attempt at attracting Slipknot fans. It is not to say there isn't anything to enjoy here. Every fan who has ever attended a Slayer show has grown to love ""Disciple"". That track live pushes it into a new level. ""Here Comes the Pain"" is a decent track and ""God Send Death"" finds Slayer doing their best nu-metal impression. The truth of the matter is that this album does not have very much going for it. It was all just a clever campaign to usurp the nu-metal fans, I would give it one more star had it worked better but they all just went running into the embrace of metalcore after the nu-metal fad ended."
2,Boring,"Alas...another once glorious thrash band has fallen. Unlike Metallica though, this album doesn't make me sick of the band all together. And at least Slayer hasn't done a song with Ja Rule yet.But on the other hand, God Hates Us All is really boring. Since when has Araya needed to say f**k every 5 seconds to be badass? Seems to me Slayer tried to put out a nu metal album to attract some more attention. But the album isn't entirely horrible I must say. Bloodline, Disciple, and New Faith are good songs, but songs like Exile and especially Payback just ruin this album.Oh well, the band still rules live at least."
3,***1/2,"Yikes, Slayer's back! Run for cover! This is one vicious album, full of raging guitars, crashing drums and the usual ""ultra-violent-yet-almost-clever"" lyrics. Probably their best output since Reign In Blood. And yes, I will agree with all the reviewers claiming that this CD has no memorable melodies to offer and that the songs tend to blend into each other to create a barrage of noise. And let me add: WHO CARES? This here CD ain't no... Billboard related stuff, mind you! You want melodies? Well, why don't you try some... er... hmmm, no, I won't get into that now. Anyway, just buy the... CD!"
1,And I thought Reign in blood sucked.,"Wow!! When I listened to Reign in blood, I said Wow, can slayer get any worse?!. But I was wrong. God hates us all is 10x worse. Well hey all of slayer's music sucks anyway right, for all the people who agree with me? Well I hate this album and it sucks. I'm not saying it's not too intense, I listen toMetallica , Megadeth and Pantera. Those bands acually play thrash metal. Slayer is death metal now. If you want real metal, get Master of puppets and or And justice for all from Metallica, Peace sells and or Rust in peace from Megadeth, And Cowboys from hell and or Vulgar display of power. Those albums are from real metal bands.P.S. God dosen't hate us all. God hates SLAYER!!!"
1,CRAP... THIS IS NOT HEAVY METAL!!!!!,"THIS IS PURE ALTERNATIVE(I DON'T DARE TO SAY THIS SH*T ARE METAL)THE REIGN IN BLOOD ERA IS GONE!!! UNFORTUNE...SO DON'T BUY THIS SH*T, STEAD BUY SOME REAL HEAVY METAL LIKE ACCEPT(WITH UDO), IRON MAIDEN, INCANTATION, DISMEMBER, TESTAMENT,(LISTEN 'THE FIRST STRIKE STILL DEADLY'!!), BLACK SABBATH, LED ZEPPELIN, DEEP PURPLE, ALTAR, ICED EARTH, DISSECTION, NEVERMORE, ETC...*PS I'M SORRY ABOUT MY POOR ENGLISH..."
1,God loves us all,"Slayer now officially sucks. I think they tried to define that with this here ""album"" that is just a bunch of profanity and screaming about how much they think ""God hates us."" News for you, God does not hate us all and for those of you who think that, have fun roasting in hell (I'm pretty sure you will). Reign in Blood was great but this is just garbage. How can you possibly call this music? It's just devil noise. I wish I could give this ""album"" negative stars. If you want to listen to real metal, try Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth...(the list continues)"
2,God Hate Us All For Releasing God Hates Us All....,"Slayer's newest offering ""God Hates Us All"" does not fail to dissapoint. I actually thought ""Diabolus In Musica"" was much better than this to be perfectly honest, but ""God Hates Us All"" lets us really know, that God must really hate us all for releasing such a dissapointing album from a band we have always looked up to. It all start after Dave Lombardo left....This really put me to sleep. No speed. No thrashing. No satanic lyrics to scare everybody. No killer guitar solos. NOTHING! ...But with Kerry King glorifying Slipknot in every interview...what would you expect. This album wins Most Dissapointing Album From A Good Band award of the year...!!!"
2,a Slayer album I can fall asleep to,"Its been going downhill since Divine Intervention hasn't it? I'm not really knocking them for trying to get into the genre of nu-metal (which will not outlast true metal) and mix it with the older slayer sound but its really just um. Well it [it's not all bad], but it doesn't really get your blood flowing, its just kind of there. Slayer have lost alot in song writing over the years, they can still pull the best live shows ever but its kind of getting old now. Its a little too bad, well known more mainstream metal sources will continue to call every stale new Slayer release THE MOST BRUTAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME while newer far more brutal bands like Anata or Burnt by The Sun will never get noticed or even a one line mention from these rotten [people].Boys, stop listening to Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, go buy some new Sabbat or Krisiun, get back to what you do best!!!"
1,"God loves you, heathens!","God hates us all, does he, Slayer?I think not! God is full of infinite love and denying his infinite grace is abhorrent!Find a bible and read! Recite the Lord's prayer 1000 times! Plead for contrition!Music like this should be burnt on a giant pyre!"
1,God doesn't hate anybody but he loves us all...,"I think it's quite sad how slayer has turn against their old fans to get radio play and mtv appereance now. It is so corny how they made their album ""god hate us all"" trying to hard, are we ?Yes! If god did realy hate us...Why would he make heaven for us to get in ? Or even forgive our sins ?Anyways, im just saying this to get new slayer fans mad and also to show slayer how they've betrayed their old fans to get slipknot and korn kids into their music in order to get more cash out of every one.God loves us all! God loves you! haha... For a slayer album that is actullie a masterpiece ? Get, reign in blood or even south of heaven but do not buy god hates us all and diabolous in musica. In order words don't buy anything from slayer except south of heaven and reign in blood. F*ck slayerrr and f*ck their new fans! Burn in hell."
4,this is an awesome cd!,"I downloaded most of this album prior to buying it and had a hard time getting into it - something seemed missing. it turns out that the quality of the downloads was not that good. Listening to this cd on my home stereo with true production quality makes all the difference in the world.This album definitely rates higher than diabolus in that almost every song is excellent. Listen to it a few times and you'll notice all the heaviness this album has to offer.It doesn't gt 5 stars cause I would have appreciated a bit of variation in the vocals or even less lyrics. It takes away from the excellent music underneath.Nonetheless, Slaytanic Wermacht rules!"
3,The forced vocals hurt the recording .,"Listen to Bloodline, where the singer eases up a bit, then other songs where Tom forces his vocals, resulting in an unpleasant harsh tone.As far as the written material goes, as one reviewer previously stated, if this was released in the South of Heaven period, it would have been a classic.Mind you, if the vocals on this cd were on those recordings, they would have not been considered classics"
4,released on september 11 2001,"This is probably the best of the Bostaph era. An extremely heavy album written mostly by Kerry King. Tom Araya turns in an overwhelming vocal performance. An over the top yelling style which is his most intense vocals ever. There is some filler on here,mainly,threshold,castdown,and exile.This is not in any way a superb album but its still an essential purchase for any Slayer or extreme music fan. This is the last Slayer to feature Paul Bostaph."
5,Raw,This album is just that. Wicked. The most extreme metal Slayer have made in years. All you minions around the world - the wait was worth it! This goes off! Try to get your hands on a Jap/Aust. release for the 2 bonus tracks. Can't wait to meet the band in the flesh in a couple of days.
4,One Of Slayer's Best,"I can't believe the crap I read about this album, every song on this album is great in it's own right. What you got here is a very heavy, wicked return to form. The production, though a little digital-sounding breathes life into the band and gets them out of that 90's rut they were in. I would put this album right after Reign and Christ Illusion. Though this album is a very solid effort I have a few complaints: 1- There's actually too many songs here and it somewhat dulls the ""punch in the face"" approach because right around the middle of the album it starts to seem a little lengthy, but thankfully ""Warzone"", ""Here Comes The Pain"", and ""Payback"" put you right back into it again. 2- Tom Araya's vocals aren's so much angry as they are just really loud. I miss the lower ""Reign"" Style. Don't let that slow you down...But it!!"
1,Way too inappropriate of a title,"I'm gonna start off by saying yes I believe in God and I am a christian, however, that doesnt make me a non metal pussy. I love my metal (Judas Priest, Megadeth, Metallica, BLS, Panter) and yea, even a little bit of Slayer. But not only is the title of this album innapropriate, it's f*ckin cheesey. ""God Hates Us All"" ooo look out we are God hates and sh*t. Shut up. These guys dont even believe in God so why is God a theme for almost every f*ckin song. Slayer, you suck!!!"
2,"Great band, mediocre output","Slayer are by far one of the greatest bands of all time. ""Reign In Blood"", ""Seasons In the Abyss"", and to a lesser extent ""South of Heaven"" are masterpeices of the metal genre. From ""Seasons"" onward, they have shown some intelligence in addition to agression and speed. Slayer can do better than this. It's not a bad album by any means, its just one that I don't feel the need to listen to more than once. There are only two standout tracks, ""Bloodline"" and ""Payback"", and you may as well skip over the rest of the tracks. Better luck next time."
2,Oh c'mon already....,"Possibly the most over hyped metal band ever. Granted, producing one of the best thrash albums ever (""Reign""..of course), Slayer were at one time a force to be reckoned with. While i'm certain they still are in the live setting, they need to resign themselves to stop recording new albums.They're obviously trying to incorporate ""nu-metal"" into the Slayer sound, and it's kind of sad. Listening to the band who created ""Angel Of Death"" fretting about marketability is just kind of pitiful. Definitely a worthwhile purchase for 14 year olds who think Slipknot is cool, but for old-school Slayer diehards, just skip it."
1,"Predictable, affected, commercialized unMetal","""God Hates Us All"" is uncreative and nonaggressive, and reinforces the notion that Slayer no longer are in possession of any smatch of manhood or talent. This album conjures up images of...primates banging half-heartedly, cretinously on trash-cans. The music is reprehensibly SOFT and the lyrics are nothing short of stereotypical, ludicrously superficial pseudo-subversiveness and laughable infantilism. Of course, Slayer have to maintain their gimmickry to seduce all the kiddies and make their living. But this is just beyond spiritlessness and mediocrity... Slayer cannot sink into a lower level of instrumental debility and artistic sterility. I wouldn't classify Slayer as Metal; Slayer don't deserve that; Slayer may be acceptably referred to as ""...commoditized teenybop half-metal"", but the label of Metal is indefensible."
1,What happened???,"I've been a Slayer fan for years. Since the first demo I found back in the 80s. Anyway, I've been disapointed in the last several albums, and this is no exception. I think they are trying too hard to be 'brutal' in their old age. I keep waiting for another album along the lines of Seasons, Reign, or South, but no luck.Oh well, I still have the 3 best Slayer albums ever (named above) so that'll have to do me until they get whatever it is they have out of their systems and start making music again."
2,I HATE THIS CD..,And you should too...Avoid this CD Slayer and metal fans! Why? Because Tom screams like Sam Kinison on every single track. There is no variety or tempo change. AND Kerry King wrote too many of the songs which all bleed together into one large lump of indistinguishable garbled anti-religious boredom. The lesson Slayer should have learned from this mess is that Jeff Hanneman is the main writer for Slayer for a reason and that its important to have tempo changes and melody infused in your songs.It gives the CD musical variety which is what this CD is sorely lacking.Best Track: Bloodline
4,...,"One of the hardest, fastest and most brutal albums ever recorded.Quite heavy on the anti-religious lyrics so be warned if your religiously inclined. Although you'd have to be a complete moron to be religious and buy an album called ""God Hates Us All"". Mind you, you'd have to be a moron to be religious.Good, insanely aggressive slab of Thrash. Not Slayer's best though. 7.5/10Download these: ""God Send Death"" ""Disciple"" ""Bloodline"" ""New Faith""."
5,A-mazing.,"Slayer still has it. Pity the drummer didn't injure himself earlier, could have had the original drummer Dave Lombardo on this release..."
3,Maybe he just does...,"(...)Call me naive, but I actually find it highly unlikely that Slayer knew what was going to happen on September 11. The fact that this album entered the world on the same day as that world's greatest act of murder is grim, chilling coincidence. Let's not confuse effect and cause - Slayer tell it like it is and that fact was never more grimly illustrated. And they take this stuff seriously - a lot more seriously than some of the unprofessional news stations who descended into saccharine sentimentality when the world wanted hard-headed analysis.As for the album itself, well... I am afraid the Diabolus still has all the best tunes. Disciple is a uniquely ferocious and stupendous song, and several others (War Zone, Exile, Threshold) rock with unfeasible intensity, but in general the bass has gone, the riffs are squandered and the anger is diluted. Still streets ahead of each and every nu-metal fraud, however, and well worth getting. Will you be this angry when you're in your 40s?"
3,Badasses don't have to have ballads,"(...)This is probably the weakest Slayer album to date, but it is still good."
5,DAMN GOOD...........PERIOD!!!!! A CLASSIC THRASH!!!!!,"I dont care if you hate this ablum, if you like it, your a true slayer fan. ROCK ON- SLAYER never dissapoints unlike others they've stayed true to the genre, unlike metallica from their time...sorry to even mention their forsakened name damn them!!..... I love everything from lyrics to the cover to the slashing solos to the smashing drums to the fast war-zonic riffs, man IF YOU THINK THIS SUCKS TRY GO MAKING A BETTER ALBUM - - - - not for sad soft hearted p u s s i e s like this:(Comrade Ren ""Altarboy of Madness"" (Lowell, IN))- like that reviewer said who cry about lyrics being too "" i hate this i hate that, f -this f-that"" they write what they feel i hear what the F#$* i feel. SO your not the type so F#$* WHAT!!!!! QUIT CRYING this ablum has been spinning so much since 2001 i had to get it 5 X'S more so who ever hates it eat US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"GOOD MUSIC, TERRIBLE LYRICS.","Slayer finally made a mistake. That mistake was allowing Kerry King to write most of this CD. Many of the songs on here have Nu-Metal or Mall-core elements. And the lyrics are just so bad. Slayer abandoned the usual ""dungeons and dragons"" theme of writing about Hell, Satan, Evil, etc. Instead this album is about getting into fights, being [ticked] off, and hating everything. Basically, this is a Slipknot album but much heavier. The guitar solos are even kept to a minimum on here. However, I stay loyal to Slayer and recommend this album to any metal fan."
5,angry thrash death metal,"its sad to say that this is the only slayer album i own, but i have downloaded some of their stuff from reign in blood, hauntiong the chapel, and diablous in musica. all i can say is that through the years, they have matured as musicians, it is obvious when you listen to the entire album. but basically, its just about the same rage, brutality. i can't wait for their next album. ill buy it at once!!!"
4,MAN SOME PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID....,"WHY THE hEll did U GUYS TAKE THE TITLE So SErIOUSLY? I MEAN ITS OFFENSIVE BUT AN ALBUM's TITLE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE SONGS IT HAS. ALTHO THIS MAY NEVER HOL A CANDLE TO 80's RELEASES BY SLAYER, THIS STILL KICKS ASS. EVERYONE WAS SO SCARED THAT NU-METAL MIGHT GET TO SLAYER, BUT THEY STAYED TRUE TO THEIR ROOTS. DISCIPLE IS ONE OF THE BEST OPENERS SLAYER EVER DID....BLOODLINE IS AN AMAZING, AMAZING TRACK....GOD SEND DEATH MAY BE BLASPHEMOUS BUT ITS THRASHY FUN....PEOPLE PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS TOO SERIOUSLY...U ALL NEED TO CHILL OUT...SLAYER SEEMS LIKE A CHRISTIAN BAND COMPARED TO STUPID BLACK METAL WANNABE ACTS TODAY (DIMMU BORGIR, MAYHEM, EMPEROR, SATYRICON...ETC.) THOSE BANDS ARE SATANIC STUPIDITY...."
2,I love slayer.... I HATE this album,To much..to soon...to ANNOYING.There is no substance with this album...only swearing and cutting down god.Paul still is kickin just fine though with his double bass..and remarkable hand speed..basically the other guys r just there to play over top of him.Bring back the old slayer days where Tom at least ATTEMPTED to sing and not pierce the speakers with annoying yell's.Also another bone i have to pick is why all the god bashing all of a sudden..im not mr religion but if GOD HATES US ALL...why r we still alive???....Also how supernatural is it that THIS album came out on September 11th 2001??After being delayed twice for release dates....Scareeeey.All in all this isnt slayers best or even close.
4,"Great, but not their best.","Slayer picked up a lot of new fans with this album, and probably lost a lot of old school fans. Slayer has been my favorite band since 1991. If you're a new Slayer fan make sure you check out the older albums. My favorites are..#1 Show No Mercy (Their first album)#2 Seasons In The Abyss#3 Reign In BloodBuy all three if you don't have them yet. Actually buy every album they have ever put out. You won't regret it. If I had to choose from all of my Slayer albums or all the others I own I'd choose my Slayer albums."
3,"A good album -> 3,5 stars","This album has some very very good songs like Disciple - God send death - new faith - Bloodlines. The other songs are a little bit just ok. I have mixed feelings since the tracks that i have said are really good , but the album overall is not like this. The production is a little bit noisy and the tracks are more loud than they should have been and its a little annoying. If you are new to Slayer check Seasons in the Abyss - South of heaven - Diabolus in musica (which is my favorite)"
5,Slayer is Great,"I've been a long time Slayer fan, and I also have listened to Bands who have lost their edge over the years. Slayer has not. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman have stayed true to us, and if you want a loud, ass-kicking c.d. , pick this one up. My favorite is Payback. Great Pit song. enjoy"
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,Theres not much songwriting talent here. I realize slayer is black/thrash but they could put a little melody or catchiness to the songs. I cant tell one from the next - they all sound the same. The singer screaming like Sam Kinison and some random pointless guitar chords. Bloodline is a damn good tune though and is the only redeeming song on here. They could keep the anger and aggression and make it a little catchier.
1,Slayers weakest effort to date,"Firstly I'm not just giving this one star because it's the lowest or because I didn't like the album. I'm giving it one star because that is what this album truly deserves.This is a muddled and directionless affair. Particular low points are the vocals, really weak and forced, the drums which sound terrible and most importantly the songs, very uninspired and just forgettable.I could go into lots of detail but the point is if they didn't have the name and reputation to back them up nobody would have given this a second glance.Check out any of the Lombardo era albums which forged Slayers rep."
1,PURE sh*t,"Don't waste your time or money on this if you're a fan of classic Slayer material. Gone are blurring riffs & speed, Tom has resorted to shouting rather than ""singing"". He also apparently couldn't think of any lyrics, because nearly every song is flooded with profanity. Something that no one has to do. This CD has more ""F"" words than a porn video, I threw it in the garbage, where it belongs!"
2,Could have been good,"This cd could have been the next reign in blood..Great brutal slayer riffs , awesome mind drilling drumming, but I hate the way Tom's screams on this one..his voice on a lot of the songs is more annoying than ever!!!! It sounds like he is trying to annoy the listener on purpose.. A lot of the songs lose focus at the end like Disciple and New Faith..I wish Tom would go back to his old vocals like in Reign in Blood and Hell Awaits"
2,Simply Rotten,"I do not like the new Slayer album and I love Slayer. I have been a fan for 15 years now and I must say I am deeply disappointed in this album. To me it sounds like a rehash of everything they have ever done. Don't get me wrong, the music itself is pretty good but listening to Jeff and Kerry play solo's that sound like they were cut and pasted from previous records just plain stinks. And Tom uses the same vocal phrasing he has done on previous recordings as well. Different lyrics with no style. The drumming is damn good however so if you like your drummers then you'll definetly love this album. I think Bloodline is the standout track on this album but that is my opinion. The packaging was definetly cool however. Totally Slayer. I won't say what it is but try to find the unedited version and you'll see what I mean. Hope this helps. Another listen or two and forever it will sit in the ""S"" section of my music collection."
3,Thank (Insert Deity Here) for Slayer!,"Kudos to Slayer for having the courage to maintain their musical style in this era of producer-created junk and hip-hop rock fusion. They see no need to include a ""dj"" on their album to do some ""scratchin'"". Even though this genre has lost popularity of late, (unfortunately) Slayer triumphs. Overall the album is good, full of raw emotion, but I still miss Dave Lombardo."
3,Mixed bag.,"On the one hand, this is good because it is a little faster than the other albums Slayer have released in the past 10 or so years. On the other hand, there is only really one good song: ""Payback"". When I first heard it, I thought that it was something from the ""Reign In Blood"" or ""South Of Heaven"" or ""Hell Awaits"" sessions that didn't make it onto a record until I heard the solo. The solo is not a very good one but it's better than if Brad Delson from Linkin Park tried to play a solo. Some of the other songs are pretty horrible. ""Bloodline"" sounds like a 40-year old man trying to sing nu-metal and ""God Send Death"" is noisy as hell. Well, Slayer is getting old, I'll bet these guys are almost 40 anyway, but nu metal??? Come on. These guys are supposed to be trend haters, not trend followers."
2,Drats.,A few good songs here and there. Too much new metal influance to make it real thrash. Go get Destruction's Antichrist For pure thash.
3,Araya possessed by Kinison!!,"Don't get me wrong, I love Slayer dearly. I mean, to stay true to this intensity metal for this long is something very few bands do. But I can't seem to get into this album, and even the last one (Diabolus) as well, and i've put the finger on Tom's new vocal style as the main reason. It literally sounds like he's imitating Sam Kinison's schtik. It's just one long monotone shout. The riffing has changed a bit, too, seemingly influenced by the new metal scene. The problem is the majority of the new metal bands suck and can't write a good riff! So, i guess it's back to ""Reign in Blood"" and ""South of Heaven"" for my Slayer fix."
2,BORING AND UNINSPIRED.,I see too many numetal influences on the sound of this album.The truth is that they are running out of the creativity and passion they once had.The songs are fast but they are not put together well enough to be memorable.I only like one song which is bloodline.I would not recommend this album to anyone.I feel this maybe the end of slayer if they dont get their act together.
2,Behind the curve,"""Behind the Sun"" is a kind of fable, I guess, about a small family of Brazilian sugar cane farmers. They are struggling to make it in competition with a larger family up the road. The rivalry between the families grows into a blood feud. One day, the circus comes to town in the shape of a beautiful girl and her stepfather. The small family's oldest son falls in love with the girl and runs off with her on a last gasp of fun before he meets his fate as the feud's next target.The cinematography is great, with grand expressive shots of bloody shirts hanging on clotheslines and a memorable scene of a girl being twirled on a rope. There just isn't much story though, and what there is gets awfully confusing. ""Behind the Sun"" is a story about family rivalry, honor and love, but it made precious little sense to me. There may be layers and layers of symbolic action here, but I couldn't care enough to look for them. A real miss."
1,Save Your Money,"This book should be entitled, ""Dale Carnegie meets NLP"". Using sales dialogue from the 1930's and antiqued sales/objection models, the author tries in vain to update this vapid piece by throwing in a few pages about NLP. There are better books on the market about selling and NLP. This is not one of them. Save your money."
5,Worthy of my time and money.,"After reading Hal Slater's book you should put his advice to work. I did and immediately began closing more, and larger, sales. Being in the home repair industry, nearly every sale is high ticket. With the skillsets that Hal Slater offered I am now able to offer my customers the value they deserve and offer it in a much more compelling way. Don't be put off by reviews that have an obvious ax to grind, read Hal Slater's book and ENJOY the benefits now."
1,I'm returning this book,"I have tried to like this book, but have been unsuccessful. It is more of a chatty travelogue than cookbook so I am, regretfully, returning it."
2,"Beyond beans, zucchini and cauliflower",One wonders why anyone would work so hard to bring together a collection of unappealing recipes.
1,Atsa Tainted Meatball!,"Although the recipes are uninteresting at best and the writing dull and comically pretentious the worst part of this book has to be the art direction since these books are intended to be looked at and not as cookbooks. The illustrations are terrible but someone had to pick the artist. The layout is uninspired and filled with clutter. The fonts are particularly annoying and seem like a copy of countless other Italian cookbooks. In summary, this book is a total waste of money and the people responsible should be fired forthwith."
4,DOES ITS JOB WELL,This hand truck does its job as described. No complaints. Purchased in April 2008 for daily transport of 3-15 boxes anywhere from 10-150lbs for delivery to customer in the wholesale district of New York city or for short runs to the UPS truck.
3,good but not great,"I ended up returning this cart. First of all its a lot smaller than it looks in the photos. Second, is that it was hard to set it up - it took a lot of strength to move the bars to get it to go upright. Third, is that the design of it made it easy to scratch the paint off of the sizes when you were putting it up and down. On the positive side, it is small and light weight."
3,Hornblower Connects with James Burke,"If you've read the other 10 in the Hornblower series, you're going to read this one, however it's less of the character we've come to love and rather more of a person walking the reader through the early events of the Industrial Revolution.I would recommend you to read, or see James Burke's Connection series (the first one)to understand some of the cultural history this book walks you through. As far as the character himself... the ending story is less believable."
3,it is time for retirement,"I enjoyed the short stories in this final book. It summarizes a career where Hornblower shows creativity, had a lot of luck (otherwise he never would have made it past Lt.), confusion, compassion, confusion, a need to support up naval law, an ability to ignore the law-actually violating his duties. HH ends up being soft, and is taken in by Barbara, but really all for the good. HH was almost human in dealing with Gerard and Spendlove, substitutes for Bush and Brown. HH goes into retirement at the right time."
4,Admira Honrblower,"In years past I have read all of the Hornblower series. Now with my eyesigh nearly gone (legally blind) I have boughtthe Kindle edition of ""Test to Speech""and haveenjoyed the series again. I think that the books are historicaly accurate. Tney are fiction so some liberties have been taken."
4,Love the Hornblower series!,"My sons LOVE the Hornblower series! Historical fiction that is well written. My 13yo says, ""It's about a below-average, spindly 18yo who, through hard work and obedience, achieves great things."""
4,"Not the best of series, not the worst. Still needs reading",There appeared to be some disconnects in the novel. Most likely due to the issue of several separate stories in one novel. But the disconnects were more from a miltary technical and logic and development of the tale aspect. The Coronet player said he couldn't play a B flat... Why? that was never developed. The Coronet player in a Hornblower novel... how many folks overlooked that? Neat tongue in cheek.... I still found this a good read and worth the purchase.
3,Not as expected...,"After reading the description for the product, I knew this was exactly what I wanted (I had recently given birth). After receiving the product, the ""molded cups"" weren't really molded and it didn't offer much support or firmness that I associate with Flexees. The thong of the body liner was so uncomfortable! For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why there weren't any snaps or hooks in the crotch to make using the restroom more attainable. I find myself wearing this produt as a camisole."
1,How do I bathroom with this on???,"I tried it on, fits well, good support and tummy control, great under clothes...BUT HOW DO I GO TO BATHROOM WITH THIS ON??? I would have to take off my top and remove it all the way to go to the bathroom. If I knew it didn't have a snap on off bottom, I wouldn't of bought it. My fault and waste of money."
4,Wonderful atmospheric book,"I really enjoy books by authors who have the talent to make you feel as if you are actually living the book.While the main part of this book is a mystery, you can also ""see, hear, and smell"" the English villages in this book, set in 1761.If you enjoy English mysteries, definitely buy this book! It's the first book I found by Hannah March and now I will definitely be buying her other books.Highly recommended!"
4,Fascinating stuff!,"A very worthwhile glimpse into mid-20th Century Baghdad - this series of essays paints intriguing pictures of the streets, the culture and the decline of Colonialism in a country that used to be our Middle-Eastern ally. Much better than her later books."
4,fun !,"This product is closer to the good old spirograph that I played with as a child then many other ones i tried.The book is fun, it will be perfect to practice basic english for the french child i bought it for.Yes, I did open it and played with it on scrap paper for a good 30 minutes :)"
4,Bought it as a gift,"I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old daughter, but when it came in the mail I decided to give it to my 11 year old niece. It has the templates where you can connect them to the binder rings and draw in the book. It looks like fun and she thanked me for it, so thats all I have..."
2,I purchased this for my 4 and 6 yr old grandkids. They were playing with the original spirograph...which is much easier.,Spiral Draw Book is hard to get the wheels out of the plastic cover and difficult to manage the wheels to do the spiral drawings. ANy suggestion?
2,Don't bother,"Having grown up with the old spirals, I was very disappointed in this. I bought it for a 6 year old and it was really too difficult for her to use properly. She didn't have the patience necessary to make it work. I didn't blame her either. Trying to recreate memories of fun you had as a child is difficult with this. I used to spend hours playing with different colored pencils and pens making fun designs. Don't expect your child to do so with this product."
2,I must be doing something wrong.,My 8 year old had a hard time with this and so did I. Things kept slipping. Maybe there was a better made earlier version but this one was barely usable.The holder for the parts gets in the way and the parts are nearly impossible to put back in. No wonder people report loosing them.I ordered an old Spirograph from Ebay.
1,Klutz Product Is Certainly Klutzy,"When I saw this product, I was excited to introduce my 7 year old son to the world of SpiroGraph, the creative and fun toy of my childhood. Although the Spiral Draw Book has the same pieces as my toy of old, it does not perform the same. It is very difficult (even for an adult) to keep the inner wheel moving and it does not fit easily into the grooves of the outer, stationary piece, which then makes the inner wheel slip and slide. Very frustrating and cannot be used."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The idea is wonderful and I might have even given it four stars, BUT...... the pens that come with this set did not even last through four designs. One pen never worked! We tried and tried but could not get the ink to flow. The other two pens fell apart as my daughter was making designs. The tips separated and then the ink tube began leaking. This happened with very light use! I was standing right there guiding my daughter and as she traced a few designs, the pens just fell apart. We are VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
3,Fun after getting new pens and figuring things out...,"This was a gift for my nine-year-old niece. She said that it took a little while to get the hang of using the pieces, but once she did, making spirals has been fun. The only negative of this product was that none of the included gel pens worked. Luckily, my niece was able to find some other pens at home that work with the set. I ordered this with other items, and then sent this with different items (purchased locally) to my niece in another state. It would have been too much of a hassle to try and exhange the item for pens that work. I will try and contact Klutz directly to see about the pens. It is a bummer when a little girl is so excited about having pretty gel pens, and the whole spiral set, only to find the pens unusable."
4,Christmas Gift,"This is a nice set. The large plastic piece that allows the circular pattern shapes to rotate, can be attached to the side of the book. This holds it in place a bit. Unfortunately, it does not hold it perfectly, so you need to press down with your hand while making a design. Overall, it accomplishes the task and is fun to use. The book has ""scrapbook"" type pages that are blank or offer design ideas. You can make numerous designs inside the book or use your own paper."
3,Not really good for small children,"I got this for my 4.5 year old, who is an avid drawer. She is unable to use it without getting frustrated. You need to hold the frame down rather tight/hard in order for the gears to not slip inside. If you can do that, it works well. I might suggest using different ink pens. I used some gel pens, and it worked pretty well. I also saw this locally at a certain craft store for almost twice the price. I'm hoping with some practice my daughter can use it, but so far its more like a new toy for me."
2,Do not like this product . It takes an adult to help the child draw w/ this product. Not like the old spiralgraphs..,I thought i was getting a product that my grandchild could use by there self. It ended up it takes two people to be able to draw w/ this product. Very dissatisfied ! I ordered it the first week of Dec. never got it until way after Christmas.. They had to resend the product...So unhappy.
3,Klutz Spiral Draw Book,"Wish it had the oblong ""wheels"" like the original Spirograph did! The old versions are available on eBay...but VERY expensive! Grandson seems to like this one just fine."
4,Lots of fun for my 5 year old,"I used to have a spirograph when I was younger, so I was so excited to get this spiral draw book for my 5 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it! Uses it all the time. The first day, it took some getting used to figuring out how to get the round shape to move around, but now she's a pro at it. The only thing I wish is that there was better storage for the parts. You can put them all back in the plastic cover, but you have to put them in so precisely (and often, I'm the one who has to clean it up rather than my daughter).It comes with three tiny pens, but you can use any pen and it will still work."
4,A Little Treasure of Spells,"This little gem of a book contains numerous spells, charms, recipes and rituals. It is a book that is not based on a particular path but leans towards the to the way of the old Nature Religions. Very appealing to anybody intrested in ancient lore and occult rituals, this would be a wise addition to any library."
3,Looks Better that it works,"I guess $3 does not buy too much. This product was received promptly, but when used the vinyl washer won't stay in and it leaks with water pressure. It does eventually fill my RVs tank."
3,"Too little, too much","This is a good 50 page book concisely wrapped in 375 pages. The author obviously uses most of the material in lectures/workshops, as the graphics are powerpoint and each page seems to require a list of i), ii), iii), etc. Some material on asset classes is good but it takes a lot of plowing to find those gems. I agree the author seems more intent on coaxing you to use an advisor, like himself, and to try and time the market (oh if only we could.) For an average investor, as I consider myself, I think a book like ""Asset Dedication"" by Huxley and Burns makes far more sense and better reading."
3,"Okay, but for the individual investor there are better books","This book reads a little too much like a textbook. If I was a financial advisor, I would probably see more value in it. I preferred William Bernstein's ""Intelligent Asset Allocator"" to this book. Bernstein talks more directly to the small investor."
3,Looking for someone new in your collection...,"This CD would be a great addition to anyone's CD collection who LOVES Jazz and is looking to find someone ""new"" to add on the shelf. It has definate Corea overtones to it, but has it's own flavor to be sure. This album could have easily been an old ECM gem from the 70's. The sound that this trio gets is huge, its really great; and with out a drummer, or a bass player one might be wondering ""how would a trio like this keep up the intensity?""; well, just pop it in a listen. The second track is worth the price of the CD alone, if you are a fan of composition as well as improvisation. The writing/arrangements are solid all around, which is such an overlooked part of any album sometimes, and the playing is great especially Geoff Keezer, not to overshadow the other guy's by any means, but yeah... WOW."
2,not the best.,"This lens was good for one thing. I could sneek it past security into events that did not allow for lenses over 6 inches in lenght. Otherwise it was just heavy, clunky, loud, fuzzy, and the zoom lock didn't work right out if the box.It took a lot of work to get decent images from this lens, and a lot of forethought. Simply not recomended."
2,not as advertised,"I downloaded a sample of this book on my Kindle. The first surprise was the copyright. 1975. Then I discovered that the publisher is Regal Books which is 'a ministry of Gospel Light, an evangelical Christian publisher dedicated to serving the local church'. Not deterred - a good book is a good book - I read the sample which sounds like a church sermon. This is not a self-help book on understanding emotions, but a discussion of platitudes that we have all heard before. Amazon needs to describe their products better. I once bought 'a book' on apple cider vinegar only to find it was about a dozen pages of information."
4,Goldilocks for a 3 year old,"This is the story of goldilocks & the three bears written very simply with repeated words & colorful drawings. My not yet 3 year old loves to count the chairs, birds & porridge bowls. He's learning the hard & soft, going up the stairs & such. I would think that this book would be a little dull for an older kid, although it's easy to read. But definitely a keeper for us right now."
3,decent but repetetive,"A decent cd. Some really great peices but can be unstructured in some parts. The vocals are a real relief over most prog bands today. This band is not in any way better then Marillion. The songs lack the emotion and depth(atleast from this collection).Would like to hear more but I havnt been won over enough to spend 30 bucks on an import. I agree with the other reviewer, The art work is pathetic."
3,A look at an earlier time on our country's religion,"Being a Cartwright, I have always heard of Peter Cartwright, but this was a real eye opener into the history of our country and its religion in the first half of the 19th century. It was difficult to read, being an autobiography and a copy of the old book. The print was the most difficult part of the read. Peter Cartwright's writing was amazingly modern and easier than some old writings I have read. His trials are an inspiration for any young preacher who has it ""modern and easy"" to preach the gospel."
1,A Sophmoric Analysis,"I don't normally write reviews, but this book moved me to take action. This book is profoundly disrespectful of its audience. It is utterly sophmoric. This might pass a high school economics course, but it fails as serious scholarship or analysis on any other level. The writing style is immature and emotional. The facts are anecdotal, and she fails to construct an acceptable cause-effect dynamic. She trots out disparate and unrelated factoids to support her thesis, vice structuring a scientific argument, collecting and organizing available data, observing the phenomenon, and letting the data dictate the thesis. I was profoundly disappointed by this book.Avoid this book at all costs."

I was profoundly disappointed by this book.Avoid this book at all costs."
4,What Everyone Needs to Know,"This is a timely, thoughtful book that should be on each student's and citizen's bookshelf. The author describes how global capitalism has fundamentally restructure the participatory political process and changed hundred year old customs. Global capitalism is only interested in exploiting markets to increase profits and homogenization of cultures to minimize differences in taste so costs can be lowered. As to J Janus's top 1000 reviewer, his review merely proposes solutions which are really the very problems Noreena Hertz describes. Besides, Noreena is a published author J Janus, isn't that enough entreprenurial spirit for you?"
3,collector,This Barbie was bought for my daughter when she graduated from college as an Art Teacher. She has also been a collector of Barbies since she was young so they do not get played with.
3,Low quality and so few options,My husband and I got this for our 3 year old and were somewhat disappointed. We both were expecting more options for accessories. Also the little door on his back keeps popping off. Toy is still great for discussing some body parts and clothes with a todder and for working on fine motor skills.
4,Mr Potato Head,"My 2 year old son likes to play with this toy. Right now, his creations tend to look more like ""Mr. Potasso-heads"" as the arms and other body parts don't always end up going in the expected locations. Overall, a fun toy for a young kid."
2,"Mr Potato Head, broke his butt",This product is not very good... I believe we just got a bad potato... because we have a Mrs potato head too... but the compartment flap doesnt stay on... it falls off all the time... it doesnt hold properly.
3,Works but a little flimsy,I think I thought that this toy would have been a little more durable. The storage compartment comes apart from the rest of the potato very easily so we've lost it several times making it a little difficult to store all of Mr. Potato head's accessories without losing them as well. But it does the trick of making different faces and looks like what you would expect. I just hadn't come in contact with any Mr. Potato heads that were so cheap feeling.
5,Mr Potato Head,My grandson is finding out how much fun this toy is. We play with it together putting his ears and nose in different places.
4,Classic,It's a classic - can you really say it's a bad toy? My son had a couple of mini tater heads so I got this one free on the promo a while back. My son was happy to get it and played with it right away. Grandma and myself both got a kick out of it too.
5,Wonderful,"This third book by Ms. Hawes details a homecoming trip to the southern regions of Italy. I loved it. I only hope that she'll write another volume at some point. I found her uncovering the details and backstory of life in the south fascinating. It's one of those books that you're reluctant to finish, you just want it to go on and on."
3,Decent Chanter,"I just started piping when i bought this chanter. The one I got had metal were the white plastic is in the picture. It works fine it comes with a reed and i use it almost everyday.since it is made of a somewhat weak wood it came with a small dent by a hole (not visible by the naked eye unless you looke carefully and probably from bad shipping) and at the bottom of it has a bit of it chipped off. I recommend getting a plastic chanter for a beginner or an african blackwood chanter for advanced pipers. As for this it works just fine, has good quality and any begginer who wants a somewhat nicelooking chanter should get this type of chanter. Good luck with it:)"
3,A little lost gem of a book,"Although Eben Holden is the title of the book, it's really about the life story of the narrator, Willie Brower. Willie is orphaned at a young age. Old Eben carries the child away, literally, into a new life in what I take to be New York. Willie records the travels through the wilderness, their adoption into a new home, and the homespun yarns of Eben and others. As he grows up, Willie becomes Bill, tries his hand at wooing the talented Hope, gets a job as a journalist only to quit and join the army just in time for the first battle of Bull Run. It's a quaint, simple story published in 1900 and would be suitible reading for young people. There is a description of the battle but I wouldn't consider it too bloody."
5,New York,"I love this raincoat!!!! A real people stopper!!!! A little problem with billing and getting the coat, but well worth the wait. Runs big, but plenty of room for sweaters. Looks just as good with dressy dresses as does jeans."
2,Not rainproof!,"I bought this raincoat (at Nordstrom) as a stylish solution for a travel/rain coat. The coat is beautiful, and I get lots of compliments, but I also get soaked. It is definitely not waterproof; it is water resistant. Carry an umbrella or you will get soaked in a heavy rain. I feel as if I wasted over $200."
1,Merchandise not Received yet!,Although I am looking forward to receiving the merchandise as of yet I have not received the merchandise. It has been quite sometime and although promised that the merchandise would be coming in last Wednesday I am beginning to loose hope!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"It is not very good at all. I bought this in a discount movie bin and wasn't expecting a lot, but I found this movie disapointing. I've read most of Lovecraft's stories along with L. Sprague DeCamp's biography of HPL, and I think that if he were around now he would have nothing to do with this mostly terrible movie. The parts of the movie that show Lovecraft copying stuff from the Necronomicon was mildly amusing- but otherwise this film was abysmal. Check out the movie ""Dagon"" (which is actually an adaption of ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"") for a better movie portrayal of the works of Lovecraft."
2,Another poor HPL film,"The three separate stories in this film range from forgetable to awful, and really don't come anywhere near the classic stories of HPL. It is very entertaining to see Lovecraft portrayed, though. The casting job for that was right on, although I doubt that this professed materialist was in reality a devoted occultist."
1,Another Hideous Adaption,"This has gotta be THE most pitiable ""Lovecraft"" movie I've ever seen. The segments have little to nothing to do with the stories upon which they were based and degenerate into a laughable gorefest guaranteed to make poor Howard roll over at least a few more times in his eldritch sepulchre. The segment based on Cool Air is probably the best of the bunch. It stays somewhat true to the story and strangely enough has a not-so-cheesy love story woven into it. Unfortunately, it too fell apart when the director decided to throw a few chunks of gore in it to ""spice up"" the plot. Flat out, this is just a tacky tribute (if you can call it that) to Lovecraft that makes even the Unnamable II look like a brilliant moment in cinematic history. If you want the feel of a Lovecraft story in a movie then you're better off buying Carpenter's The Thing or The Resurrected, which was a pretty neat adaption of Charles Dexter Ward with Jane Sibbet from Herman's Head (hubba! hubba!)"
1,did they even read lovecraft?,"o.k. so you are interested in Necronomicon, that's kool, it's one hell of a good gorefest. I especially like the gory as hell third tale. But if you know anything about lovecraft's works, your in for a serious disappointment."
1,LOVECRAFT ROLLS OVER IN HIS GRAVE ONCE AGAIN!,Will anybody in movie land ever do justice to Lovecraft's stories? Those who made Necronomicon sure didn't. The movie is more than painful to watch. The script is a joke compared to Lovecraft's writing. The only thing of interest to any Lovecraft fan is the fact that Lovecraft is actually portrayed in the movie by Jeffery Combs (Re-animator).
3,Good Entertainment,"Aside from the Lovecraftian aspects, this movie is good for entertainment value. If you want to watch a horror movie that is different from the rest, Lovecraftian adaptations seem to be a lot more interesting than the average flick.However, on the Lovecraftian aspects, the movie title is misleading. The plot may be constructed around the book itself, but the movie gives absolutely no audience to the story Lovecraft put behind it. I give it three out of five - the movie impliments Lovecraftian ideas, but does not deliver the actual story Lovecraft wrote about the Necronomicon."
3,Shouldn't have been called Necronomicon,"I happen to have the Necronomicon book, and if you didn't know what it was, this movie would be very confusing. So it's not a good Lovecraft adaptation, that doesn't mean you can't still enjoy it. I personally enjoyed this more than From Beyond, and so did my friends. This also really didn't have that much to do with the Necronomicon. They talked about it in the first story, and then it dissapeared. They didn't need Lovecraft reading the book either, because he claimed it didn't exist. If you haven't read Lovecraft, this is for you, but if you have, bypass this."
2,"In his grave in Swan Point, dead Lovecraft is spinning","Although I enjoyed seeing David Warner and Richard Lynch in this video, I had to ask ""why, why, why, won't *anyone* do a faithful adaptation of a Lovecraft story?"" Great effects, nice music, but terrible to watch if pure HPL is your thing."
4,B muliti vitamins,"product arrived quickly-- however when I opened the bottle-- pills had a an odor.. I was not sure why?-- when I checked Byron Richards website-- he said if bad odor they were probably not potent anymore-- I have no way to know if this is correct- but B vitamins from Byron Richards web site-- no odor, so am using these ..."
1,Research shows Vit B in pill form doesn't work,"This supplement smells bad (like sulfur) and makes us smell bad, too (like onions).Also, research shows that vitamin B in pill form doesn't work on anyone who has used antacids, or pepto bismal, or Cimetidine, or anything that causes the stomach to lower the acid production level.I discovered that the Vit. B injections seem to have the best results. I wish I had gone to the doctor and gotten the B injections instead, or ordered the injectibles online through Dr. Gates [..] and paid someone 2 give us the injections. Now, we're stuck with bottles of this stuff and aren't going to take them because of the bad smell and they didn't work for us (energy, calmness, weight loss, etc.)"
2,not so good,"This vitamin complex has a strong odor that turned me off immediately. I tried taking them twice, and both times it made me nauseous and upset my stomach for the rest of the day. I would not recommend this product."
1,Poor description,"The wall attachment is fantastic. The problem is that you need two! This is only ONE. But the description is vague... and for good reason! This thing is a lot of money and if you knew you had to pay $9+ each, you probably would change you mind!"
1,Disappointed,"I also bought the rail to hold kitchen utensils and found out after receiving the shipment that the wall mounts are not included. You must be very careful to order two wall mounts separately, as the other reviewers mentioned, because they only come one to a pack. Very strange. After two negative reviews, the company still has not changed."
2,Boring,"I have read several of The Royal Diaries books, and found this one to be the slowest and most uninteresting of all. The child perpetually whines, and there is no grip in the writing. Perhaps this one lacked flavor, being too modern.There are so many better Royal Diaries books, I am sad to have spoilt my view of the series, with this edition.It certainly did not do the graceful princess any justice!Addendum : There is one thing I feel, in all fairness, to add. The Goodbye poem that Mr.Stephenson wrote to the princess was just so beautiful and touching. Very real!"
5,Princess Ka`iulani of Hawai`i,"Princess Ka`iulani was sent to England to continue her education. The young princess suffered many tragic losses in her short life. She goes through an enormous amount of pain while she's away from her home. Ka`iulani tried as hard as she could to not let Hawai`i go in the hands of America. Unfortunately, she failed.I really loved this book! I was so happy when I found out about it because I thought they would NEVER publish one about an Hawaiian princess. (I was also happy because I live in Hawai`i!) After all, Hawai`i tends to be left out. I hope you enjoy this book! :)"
3,My Review,"Well this book is not as good as I thought it would be. It talks about a young princess named Kaiulani. Her uncle is king of Hawaii. In the middle of this book Kaiulani is sent to England for schooling. Also in the story she finds out that she will never become queen of Hawaii. I think this book is well kinda boaring in a way. It doesn't give enough details on her and her family, just that her uncle was king. It needs more excitement and this book is not as good as some of the other Royal Diaries books."
3,"Kaiulani, The People's Princess","Kaiulani, The People's Princess by Ellen Emerson White is an okay book in the Royal Diaries series. It was pretty interesting to read about how Princess Kaiulani lived and the different Hawaiian traditions and customs. Although I love the stories in this series, I would not say this particular book is one of my favorites. Unlike other books in this series that I've read, it was a little hard to get into in the beginning, though the excitement starts to pick up after she gets to England. While she is in England going to school to become prepare for becoming queen of Hawaii, she learns of problems that are going on at home. If you want ot find out more about this book, then I think you should go and get it to see what happens to Kaiulani, but I would recommend this book only to those who don't mind a somewhat calm book with not a lot of action."
1,forced myself to finish it,"i'm sorry but this book was a major disappointment to me. i've always thought doing a hawaiian based one would be awesome, but this one was far from it. i didn't even finish it the first time. when i finally did i found that the most part of the book was just rambling on about nonsense. it wasn't until the last 20 or so pages that it even got the slightest bit interesting. i think it could've had potential if the writer hadn't seemed like she was trying to fill in blank space. i'd have preferred a shorter book that was more interesting than a long boring one. i think they should try writing about one of the many other great queens hawaii had. i can't think of the names, but i've read biographys of hawaiian royal women that were much more interesting than this was. all i can say to the author is try & try again."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I thought the Nzingha diary was awful, but at least I finished it. (Though I may not have if it hadn't been so short.) This diary on the other hand I didn't get through. About one third of the way through the book I became incredibly bored and couldn't bring myself to waste any more of my time reading it. I will give it two stars though because it features Hawaiian royalty. I bet most people don't know Hawaii ever had a royal family."
1,Not worth the wait,"Long-gone is the layered, innovative, catchy music. Replaced by what I can only assume is the product of Jim (Jimmy Pop) Franks trying to write an album by himself with his keyboard. The band seems nearly non existent. The lyrics aren't clever, and the delivery has become monotonous and drawn out.Stick to everything before this. Save your cash and by the two or three good songs from iTunes, then add them into your BHG shuffle.Kinda bummed at this turn for BHG."
2,Such a long wait for CRAP!,"I don't understand why this is getting such high reviews, this album is horrible. Hooray For Boobies is much much better. Do yourself a favor buy a turd from a street vendor instead."
2,What the hell is this?,"First of all it took THAT long to come up with 9 songs? NINE SONGS!!! What is that crap?! And with very few exceptions, the songs have no humor value at all!! This is not the BHG I remember! The only reason this piece of crap gets more than one star is because SOME of the music is good. What is this pop punk garbage. The only song that's at all funny is Ralph Wiggum. And that's just because I'm a Simpsons fan. To put it bluntly, this CD sucked!"
2,Too short,"I was waiting for like 7 years to hear this thing, but it's not what i expected. the album is short and full of uneeded stuff"
2,A Mess...Listen before you buy,"I appreciate the fact that THE BLOODHOUND GANG is an alternative rock group pursuing a mix between rap and rock and electronic music. Unfortunately, that message is even lost in this ridiculous, non-credible affair.The best part of this album is the joke withing ""Strictly for The Tardcore"" where the lead singer says ""Eminem has to cuss in his rap so sell albums. Well, Me Too, so f*** Will Smith"". That is the freshest material. The very best song is the incredibly corny, absurd ""Balls Out"". First single ""Foxtrot..."" isn't bad, it is considerably better than most of the material save for the first two. Otherwise, this album is boring and tired. The dirty jokes don't even appeal to you and you definitely don't connect with the lead singer here. The arrangements are particularly lethargic despite the use of synthesizers and driving guitars. You feel like a majority of the songs are missing something. I recommend you listen to this album before you buy it. 2 stars."
4,Awsome But not the Best,"It hurts me to give Bloodhound Gang even 4 stars I feel like I have to give them 5, but there's really only 2 or 3 songs on this CD I listen to. ""Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss"" I can't stop listening to then I can't get it out of my head after wich is rare, actually never happens, I hate repeating songs but this is non-stop for me, then ""no Hard Feelings"" is second then ""Balls Out"" Nice CD but definatly not thier best.-VickyGeez"
4,still not the ______,"still not the best or worst, as far as i am concerned, in their own pop niche that BHG has made for themselves, and a few other bands have tried to get into also, usually failing. anyway, this album is pretty good. i like it, and will listen too it from track 1 to track 12's ""this ghost track sh** is bullsh**. i just wanted to let people know that 5 years is not that bad.... considering one of their members is new (see lyrics sheet, where it has whatever his name is-""the new guy"", and on the last line of their thanks yous, they pay some tribute to him. i am not sure when their member hung himself, but other than that, the past 5 years, the gang has been in germany, doing shows and what not over their... just wanted to throw in my 2 sense."
2,only for the most die hard bhg fan...,Unfortunately not what i was expecting from their next album. Actually it's really an ep and not a good one at that. I think it's a contractual obligation and look forward to a new full length album in a few years. The one interesting thing about this album is the lack of a dj and the '80's sounding music. It just doesn't work. Uhn tss uhn tss uhn tss is probably the best song mostly because it's so poppy sounding.
3,"Not bad, but in comparison...","First off, I've been a long-time fan of Hurray For Boobies, an album full of personality and humor, so as soon as I heard ""Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo"" I was quite excited for this album.I have it now, and I like it, but it just really can't compare to the older Bloodhound. The songs all have the typical guitar drone, but the poppy hooks of old just don't make it into this album. There's a distinct lack of energy, aside from the single everyone knows.""Foxtrot"" is an all over excellent song. ""Ralph Wiggum"" is a fun amalgamation of Simpsons quotes. ""I'm The Least You Could Do"" is a detached but enjoyable track. Aside from ""Foxtrot"" though, none of the songs seem ultra-catchy or humorous.So definitely not the group's strongest effort, but it shall tide me over until they release something better. Back to the studio with you, BHG!"
1,WTF is this??!! This ain't the Bloodhound Gang,"For us fans of the Bloodhound Gang, this has been a very long 5 years. And what do we get?? A hot steaming pile of monkey poo. Did aliens abduct this band and give us replacements? Did the record label tell them that this sounded good??? What happed to the samples of songs and turntables? Where did the funny and intellegent smarta**ed lyrics go? I feel we all got bent over and got the hucklebuck from the fat guy on the CD cover and someone forgot the KY (and I don't mean Kentucky). One of their lyrics sums it up for me, ""Big let down unparalelled like the last episode of Seinfeld"". I really give this CD a big fat ZERO!!"
2,"Ha ha, now where's the REAL album?","If I wanted to be this disappointed, I could have bought the latest Eminem album. OK, it's not as bad at that, but still disappointing because the Bloodhound Gang has made such amazing stuff until now.Previous Bloodhound Gang albums have very clever musical arrangements combining multiple instruments with lyrics sung in tune and rhythm to create a song with a strong, catchy flow. On top of that the lyrics were funny as heck!This album is bland sounding. Maybe the lyrics are good, but I don't know because I don't want to listen to the songs much. See for yourself by listening to a free (and legal) stream of the whole thing on artist direct dot com."
1,Terrible,What happened to these guys?This is one of the worst albums I have heard from an established group in a long time.I was expecting alot more considering the wait for this album. The group has no where to go. I can't believe how many bad reviews this album has received either.
4,"Excellent Album, but not worth 5 years wait...","i listened to this album a month before it was released on the bloodhound gang's myspace.It's a pretty good album, but you have to be open minded. if you like old bloodhound gang and never wanted them to try sumthin new...then this ISN'T for you. Much different then Use Your Fingers or One Fierce Beer Coaster.My favorite song on here HAS to be: PensylvaniaThe cover is really sick.FINAL THOUGHT: Buy this album with an open mind"
1,Hefty Stupid,"Wasted my money on this ""album,"" listened to it once and shelved it. The Bloodhound Gang tried to appeal to their American audience with the release of ""Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo,"" being one of the only true rock songs on the album, but the cheap pop shines through. For real music, get ""One Fierce Beer Coaster."" Two out of the twelve tracks aren't even songs. They're interludes (and retarded ones at that). Don't settle for this dance hall euro-trash that The Bloodhound Gang has now reduced themselves to."
3,not bad,"Foxtrot, Uhn tiss, and No hard feelings are top draw ... up there with I hope you die, and Three Point One Four off Hooray. those songs are very catchy. and man, I'm still amazed by all the great, dare i say ""intelligent"" lyrics the guy comes up with."
3,A let down,Still not bad. Hefty fine is just a let down from previous Bloodhound Gang albums. And still better than the abercrombie rock they play nowadays....
1,No zero stars?,"This is a very different album from the Bloodhound Gang.Different in the sense that this one is really bad.If you like techno beats (God knows why you would) then listen to Uh Tiss, Uh Tiss... blah blah blah. Because, if you like techno beats, then you like bad music. And this song is lame, so you'll like it too."
3,"Not their best, but not horrible","I just got this cd today and have listened to it once. (a couple of songs twice).There were no songs that really stood out to me. ""Ralph Wiggum"" will get a lot of play among Simpsons fans, myself included, but as a song it was just ok.The ""Unh Tiss"" song wasn't too bad either.Their lyrics are just as good as they always are, and the music wounds just like any other Bloodhound Gang cd.I've been a fan of theirs for years but don't really listen to their cds long after I get it. If I had to suggest a good cd for someone looking to get into them, I'd have to offer Hooray for Boobies.This one to me sounds like more of the same but with no one song that really sounds worthy of individual hype like Fire Water Burn, Ballad of Chasey Lain, or The Bad Touch (you and me ain't nothing but mammals...)"
4,Just as Good as Hooray for Boobies!,"I thought this cd wouldnt be so good, but i was wrong. This is a great cd that can compare to their others.RalphieGet offThe stageSweetheart"
1,This time the jokes on us,"From the album cover to the apparently thrown together music on this CD, this is obviously BHG's joke on us, their fans, and a quick 10 bucks outa my pocket and into theirs. It'll be the last they're getting from me."
2,Ehhh...,"A few months before I realized that this album was on the way, I started listening to Hooray for Boobies a lot. I have to say that I had much higher expectations for this one. The clever rhymes & references to pop culture are lacking hardcore. Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo is hilarious, but the rest of the album is just, for lack of a better word, blah. The music seems a little darker & the humor is not there. I don't care for it. Had I listened before I bought it, I wouldn't have. That's just my opinion. I hope that my review helps someone out there. I would definitely recommend One Fierce Beer Coaster or Hooray for Boobies if you're looking for something funny & clever to listen to."
3,some hot moments,"not the gangs best album, but still rather good. and although some songs are just downright boring, Ralph Wiggum is one of the best songs ever. you cant help but sing along. and Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss is rather good as well. definately has it's moments."
1,WE WAITED 5 YEARS FOR THIS GARBAGE!,"I'm not gonna waste alot of time on this review cuz they didn't bother to put any time into this record. The albums before this trash were awesome and I take pride in the fact that I own them. This is just garbage, that is the only word for it. It's not funny at all, the songs do not even sound like them and it just sucks. If you want to get good cd's check out all the ones before this one. Why did they have to ruin a perfectly good band. I hope the fans boycott them at shows for delivering this to us. KEEP AWAY from this album, PLEEEEEEEEASE!"
1,At least the intro is funny.,"This album has a few highlights (relative to the rest of the cd, though). The 1st track being half of those few highlights. Sadly, it's not even a song...just an introduction.This album took the things that were annoying with H.F.B. and elaborated on it. Very different from the previous Bloodhound Gang releases, and not in a good way.The other highlight of this album was me not having to purchase it. I was able to listen to it in its entirety at Borders, thereby effectively dodging a bullet.When they proclaimed on ""Pennsylvania"" that they were Ishtar... they couldn't have been more right. So at least they are honest. Make that 3 highlights on this album: Intro, free 'screening' at Borders, and them being honest with the Ishtar comparison."
4,Upon further examination...,"When I first went through this Album I was a little disappointed, as I was looking for the usual filth latent humor set to flowing grooves. While first look did reveal some tracks of this type, I was a little thrown off by tracks like ""something diabolical"", that seemed quite serious in nature and initially, received not more than a compensatory listen.After listening to the album a few more times, I have a real affinity for tracks contained therein. So upon further examination, I can't help but recommend this new BHG effort. The group may be showing a little maturity (albeit a very small amount), which is not a bad thing. I really don't think we are in any danger of a full conversion to generic rap-rock with, dare I say, feelings. I will say though, a small amount is refreshing. While these tracks may never completely appeal to the pop masses, it truly represents a niche of music that only this band occupies, which nowadays, is quite a complement."
2,Mixed Feelings,"Waiting a few years for the Gang to come out with some new stuff. Only to have a 12 track album with only about 8 true songs. Is kinda disapointing. Since my first listin of the Gang back in 96 with FireWaterBure on the radio I was hooked. Then Hooray comes along and blew my mind away. There first cd Use your fingers is just all over the place, but it was there first album, but its a classic in its own way. But Hefty Fine is just something so far outa reach, I cry for have waiting this long for something so lacking."
5,Lots of creativity pieces,A little one can use imagination with this toy. Lots of pieces. Easy to attach pieces
3,Not overly impressed,"My daughter received this for her 2nd birthday. And while she enjoys playing with it, there are some definite flaws. First of all, the feet fall off really easily. On the other side of the scale, the pieces on the face are way too hard to take off. (I have to pull hard, and my daughter can't do it at all). Also, the earrings don't fit on if you have the arms on. I was excited about her receiving this classic toy, but she can't even play with it as it is meant to be played. What is the point?"
4,Good but could be better,"My child is a big Toy Story fan and I was looking for a MR and Mrs Potato Head that he could add to Woody, Jessie and Buzz. Playskool Mrs. Potato Head is a good toy and all pieces fit nice and secure in their slots. With one exception: Mrs. Potato Head's hair will not stay in place. Even for an adult is kind of hard to keep the hair in place when playing with your child. It's really bothering me because it's not even close to work. Aside from that, if you like your Mrs bold, then this toy is just fine."
3,Kids like it -- Cheaper elsewhere,"My grandchildren enjoy the toy a great deal. However, the price here is 40% higher than our neighborhood drugstore, not to mention Target. No benefit to purchasing here if you are buying it for children who live locally."
4,Once you get into it you wont put it down,"It took me quite some time and several attempts to get into this book, as it starts out quite (and unneccessarily) gory, but once I got over this I just could not put it down. This book again has several excellent ideas (some of them similar twists as in Mirror) and quite a good plot. Recommended reading for anybody who likes horror. Look forward to the involvement of Oscar Wilde -- excellent idea"
1,My son can do better illustrations.,"I bought this book for the illustrations, which were dissapointing to say the least. My little boy can draw better than the illustrator who created this book. Needless to say, I immediatly returned it."
4,Time will tell,"Seem good quality, time will tell.Extractors are made in USA and the Drill bits in Brazil.Drills look nicely sharpened and the big size have split tip for easier starting.As these are cobalt should drill better but they are brittle so a lot comes down to operator error.Go Slow, Gentle and Square."
2,"Handy, but not Top Quality","The left-handed cobalt drill bits are handy, but they dull fairly quickly in hard metals. The extractors are not high quality and will make you very frustrated. Be sure to use a tap handle with these, but the Irwin one is about as low quality as these extractors. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
3,not as hard of steel as you'd think,"i have used these before, but the bolt i was trying to remove had hardened to the point the drill bits would not even start"
4,"Not brilliant, but touching","This movie certainly wasn't an attention-grabber but maybe my need for that is a symtom of an over-entertained society. Overall, I am glad that I watched it and being in the beginning stages of adoption, it may mean more to me in a few years. And it may be just what my adopted child needs to see. It was sweet and positive-something that we need more of in adoption media."
5,Practical,"I ordered this book mainly for the ""Practical Training in Thought"" lecture. And was not disappointed. Steiner makes the improving of one's inner workings accessible and even fun. I think it is amazing to even pursue this type of growth, and Rudolf Steiner has already written books and books on the subject. These lectures are a perfect starting place to dip a toe in the deep sea that is the genius of Rudolf Steiner."
3,Questionable,"Came in decent time with alright packaging, but the lock part inside the box was in 2 pieces, I'm going to get epoxy to fix it but it was a little disappointing."
3,NOT RIGHT ANGLE PLUGS,"I specifically wanted right angle plugs, and I ordered this product because the item description promised this feature. They're fine power strips at a good price, but the plugs are normal straight plugs, nor right angle plugs."
4,gorgeous book,"I love this book! The only reason i didnt give it a 5 is because I really want the version in italian. Gorgeous pictures, great memories of florence"
3,Errors in the book make me suspect,"I enjoyed the book, but I found errors that make me suspect about the rest of the book I wasn't familiar with. The author lists, at various places, three different dates for the murder of Deanie O'Banion: November 1st, (P. 158), November 9th (P.95), and November 10th (P. 101). November 10th, of course, is correct. The author also states on P. 102 that Mike Genna was the one who shot O'Banion. I'm not sure on this myself, but most sources I've read state that Frankie Yale was brought in from New York and did the shooting. Finally, the author states that Richard Speck never admitted to killing the eight student nurses in 1966, but on the televised program on Investigative Reports, a reporter asked Speck if he had killed the nurses and why, Speck said he did and ""it just wasn't their night."" I enjoyed the book, but the irritating mistakes made me wonder about the accuracy about the rest of the book."
4,Return to the Scene of the Crime,"It was a very interesting book, explaining what happened at the sight and then what is there now. It would have been nice to have more pictures for people who would not be able to tour the city. One big disapointment was that the picture on the front cover was never identified anywhere in the book."
1,Very poorly written!,"This author obviously has a very poor command of the English language, though I can't imagine why since she claims to have a college degree. The book is filled with poor grammer and use of an incorrect word. For example, in one sentence she is talking about FILLING when she actually means FEELING. The book is written almost entirely in incomplete sentences. I am not impressed with her capabilities as an author nor will I ever knowingly purchase another book written by her."
2,Self-Published and Shows,"Yes I agree with the reviewer who gave this book one star, however I'm giving the author an extra star for trying! This book is ""published"" through the Holy Fire group which is basically a self-publishing kind of deal, the author chooses a particular package that they'd like and they pay the publisher to print copies. The basic package begins at $399 to get your book published. As the first reviewer on here noted there are many glaring inaccuracies and well as simple grammatical errors that an editor at a ""real"" publishing house would have corrected. Don't buy this book expecting to be awed. In fact I really wouldn't recommend buying this book at all."
1,This rates a minus 2 stars!,"This book is very frustrating to read; bad grammar, spelling and punctuation! Not worth the price at all!I normally love anything Amish or Lancaster!"
1,Amateur Writer and Editor - Don't Bother,"I was really disappointed in the way this book was written. I don't think anyone edited this book before it was published. There were more typos and grammatical errors in this book then I've ever seen in anything. It was so distracting that I couldn't finish the book.In addition, the writer sounded either like she was a child or writing for a child. Portions of dialogue don't make sense and again, the grammatical and spelling errors were horrendous.I might have enjoyed the story if someone else had written it, but between the stunted dialogue, the poor spelling and grammar and the horrible typesetting (most letters were only half there) I didn't even finish half of this book. A real waste of money I'm sorry to say!"
1,Leaving Lancaster County,"In my opinion, this is a very poorly written book. There were far too many grammatical errors, choppy sentences and it was hard to follow the chacters."
1,very Disappointed,"I am fascinated by the Amish and read every book on this topic I can getmy hands on. I did not finish ""Leaving Lancaster County"". The typos,misused words, and bad sentence structure were just more than I could take. Anyone want to read it????You can have my copy for free!!Judy W"
1,Terrible,"I rarely feel strongly enough about a book that I read to write a review, but in this case I feel I must. This is a terrible book. No editor looked at this book before it was published, nor would they have published it if they had. I, also, love all things Amish but I couldn't get past the first 10 pages. Unreadable!"
1,Very inaccurate picture of the Amish life,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The Amish life is very poorly depicted. By the title character falling in love with an ""outsider"" (non-Amish), she would have been shunned by the Amish community. And Amish children only go to school through the 8th grade, and she is accepted into college with no problem! This is also unheard of! There were far too many discrepancies and this book really misleads people as to how the Amish live and believe.I was also appalled at all of the grammar, misspelled words and punctuation errors. There was not a single page without some kind of error on it - this was very distracting trying to read the story.I do NOT recommend reading this book - there are plenty of other excellent books - both fiction and nonfiction - that give a much more accurate portrayal of the Amish."
1,I am astounded!,I do a lot of reading and especially enjoy the stories of the Amish. I only made it to page three on this book- there are so many typos and grammatical errors I couldn't continue. Also the font is very light and hard to focus on. My son runs a publishing company and if he ever put out a book like this I would be embarrassed.
3,Not her best effort,"If you like the Troubleshooters books, which I do, this will be a disappointment to you. I read them first and bought this one after. Her writing has improved substantially over the last ten years."
2,gah - waaaay too many typos,The story was okay and probably would have been so much better if it weren't for the incredible abundance of typos in the Kindle version. Think I may go and try to get my money back...
3,Overall ok book.,The child abuse and alcoholism references are disturbing. I didn't consider this book a romance novel. I've read other books by Ms. Brockmann and this is not one of her best.
4,First Brockman book and I'd read another,"I tried to read the Bodyguard once, many authors and various books later, I'm now trying another Brockman. It was good, kept me anxious to ""get back to my reading""...and I liked the characters well enough, the confilict and setting enough to keep going. Having been in the movie business, I found her portrayal real and accurate of what happens behind the scenes without coming off too cheesy. Now, I'm trying to find another Brockman that's equal, hopefully even better."
2,You may skip this one!,"This was my second book by Suzanne Brockmann. I believe that she could not show her talent in this book. The plot was so predictable. The alcoholism issue had made the male character believeable but many repeats on this matter were humiliating. If you are a real fan of hers, buy it, if not skip this one."
1,Heartthrob Audiobook Review,"Reading the actual book may have changed my review as opposed to listening to the audiobook. As it stands, the audio book was horrible. Listening to this book was a major chore. The reader sounded like a young Casey Kasem, as if he were announcing the main and secondary characters bios. He sounded like he was reading. Everything was dramatic or overly emotional.Nor did I care for 18 year old Jamal and 15 year old Susie declaring their love for each other. Although there were no intimacies between them, it didn't sit well with me. Nor the fact that Jamal was Black and Susie White. Personally I would prefer to see it the other way around. Instead of it looking like Black men always want White women.Overall I can't recommend this book. Suzanne Brockmann's Navy Seal books are awesome. This one is not."
1,Skip this one -- you will be disappointed,"Listened to this on tape. Didn't like the reader's style. Didn't really like Jericho and didn't want him to have a romantic fling with Kate. Overall pretty disappointed in this one. Predictable that the poor lothario still ""gets the girl"" even though he doesn't deserve her."
3,Does the job,"This kit fit perfectly in my car and was the right size for the Kenwood MP345U head-unit that I ordered. However there are a couple of plastic tabs that need to be snapped off to fit in Kia Optimas and that was a tough one to break. I did not have a too to pry them off and it took me a while and effort to get them off. Other than this, I would recommend this kit!"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HUNK OF JUNK!!!!! IT DOES NOT HAVE WHOLE SONGS IN IT AND THE PARTS THAT ARE THERE ARE TOTALLY WRONG!!!! THIS IS THE WORST TAB BOOK I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!
2,Some hooks fine some defective,"Rosle is moving their manufacturing to China and having problems with quality control. Some of the hooks were fine but others lost the plastic sleeve that lines the inside of the hooks when pushed onto the rail and then were impossible to install as the sleeve got in the way. I was able to fix the hooks by prying them slightly more open with a screw driver, but now they are looser than I'd like and still difficult to move around the rail as I adjust hooks to suit my cooking needs."
3,"Nice hooks, suggest a handyman in the house","As previous reviewer already stated all Rosle stuff is now manufactured in China.I had to adjust a good half of hooks I ordered. Some of them were too tight, some too loose. You need a screw driver and pliers with plastic inserts to adjust hooks before placing them into the rail. If you have only regular pliers use a couple of pieces of wood to avoid scratches.Other than that it's a nice and stylish product."
5,Guilty as charged,"This is a book I will definitely recommend to my friends. It is also a book I must re-read. Each chapter pounds you with example after example to the extent you feel you can't wait until your 3 minutes in the ring are over so you can collect your mental breath.I have long believed what she puts forward; have not read another book so concisely organized; and find it difficult to believe most of this has occurred in my lifetime. I am so weary of hearing both sides (Republican/Democrat, Liberal/Conservative) haranguing each other when both sides are equally guilty as pointed out so eloquently by Ms. Crier. Their words are different, but the actions are the same.However, I do not share her belief (hope?) that the actions of our lawyers and politicians can be changed. Several generations have been immersed in this system and have not been taught that ""When in the course of human events..."" we have the right, no, obligation to change that course. I weep for my country."
3,collaboration,"The text was imformative, enlightening and at times, for me, depressing. Depressing because in the absence of a major movement towards implimenting rational legislation and laws to stop the nonsense,I'm afraid we will have to live with it. Crier could have done well to collaborate with Michael Moore, ""Stupid White Men"". Perhaps between the two of them, someone, somewhere,just might be moved to action."
2,"All Bark, No Bite","The fundamental problem with the ramblings of folks like Crier and Philip Howard is that, while they have found a way to sell books by identifying a problem that resonates with the rich, they offer no concrete solutions that would be practicable and, more importantly, an improvement. Without a lawyer, persons injured by the fault of others simply cannot obtain fair compensation for their harm, since the pursestrings otherwise are kept taut by the corporations, insurance companies, and others who would prefer to have their misdeeds forgotten. Evil still exists in this world, and it is not confined to those who abuse the current legal system. If a new system were created, new abuses would emerge -- and with the field slanted toward big business, the victims of harm inflicted by the ""haves"" likely would see their slice of justice sink even further."
3,First kill all the lawyers,"Not often a lawyer writes about book against lawyers, but that is exactly what Catherine Crier has done in her book The Case Against Lawyers.Maybe Shakespeare was onto something when he wrote in Henry VI the famed verse, ""First thing we do is kill all the lawyers."" We laugh now, but Crier spells out a compelling case how this elite group has created a litigious environment that causes more harm than good.Crier does not hold back as she asserts her distrust in bureaucrats, politicians, and all those who murk up the waters to complicate the calm waters of democracy.In the end she points to reforms in Civil Litigation, regulatory laws, criminal laws to name a few. But this book is about ranting and raving on an easy target, the perceived elites of our systems."
4,Simple writing for those new to the subject,"I would saythat this book is a far cry from a serious and scholarly attempt to reform the legal sysytem. On the other hand, unlike the other reviewers so far, I don't hold that against it, since it is meant to be an introduction to a subject that most Americans are just realizing is a problem. The almost frothing responses this book has gotten from lawyers and legal scholars seem to tell me that she's on to something, and the other reviews are an excellent example.In short, buy this book if you-a) don't understand the question-b) realize that the legal system is being written by the people in the biggest position to profit from itand/or-c) if you honestly think that maybe people should have some concept of personal responsibility for their actionson the other hand, don't buy it if you want to work for a major law firm or if you are already well versed in both sides of the issue."
4,Love Mr. 'Tato Head!,"My 23 month old son got this for Christmas and he hasn't put it down since. He has a blast creating all sorts of wacky faces and even gives Mr. 'Tato Head (as he calls him) his own voice. The case is a nice idea, but it's hard to jam everything back into after you first open it. I just got one of those small Rubbermaid totes and I store everything in there."
4,Educational and Fun!,"I bought this toy for my 20 month old daughter and she loves it! It turned out to be very educational. She verbalizes the body parts and can figure out where they go. I also like the carrying case it comes in. It makes it very easy to travel with. However, my daughter needs assistance when playing because Mr. Potato Head is not very sturdy on his feet and falls over when trying to put in or take out pieces. The pieces also are hard to get out once they are inserted into the head. Overall, it is a great toy!"
4,My 2 year old loves it!,"My 2 year old loves this toy. Its a good price and comes with a nice little plastic case to store all the parts. Watch out for your dogs though, they like to chew the plastic parts!"
3,The Silly Suitcase....,All I have to say about the silly suitcase is that its just not like the traditional Mr.Potato head that I used to play with when I was younger I was quite dissapointed in this item ofter I bought it. I expected much more...
4,Mr. Potato Head meets the working world,"Mr. Potato Head and his Silly Suitcase have added tons of fun to our office! Of all the Mr. Potato Heads available, this one comes with the most parts and therefore offers more interchangable fun. A definite boost to productivity!"
5,Toys - Mr. Potato Head,"This is a fantastic toy. The parts are large and safe enough for a 2 yr. old. It travels well with the included case. We take it anytime there will be a wait (doctor's office, family trips, shopping). Hours of creative fun. All the parts fit compactly inside of the potato and/or the case. Thanks for bringing back one of the greatest toys made."
4,NO TITLE,"The only problem I have had with the Potato Head is that some of the pieces are very hard to get in the appropriate hole. Some, like the feet, were to loose once in, and just fell off. Our daughter is only 2.5, and I have seen her struggle to get the pieces in, I have helped her numerous times.The suitcase does make a nice extra, easy to clean up!"
5,Nice,I like that everything fits in the case. My 2 year old enjoys dumping all the pieces on the floor. No big deal. You can also store a few parts in the potato and take it with you. Very happy with purchase.
5,excellent writer,"Tess Mallory really out-did herself on her trilogy on time-travel to the Scottish Highlands.From the very first page the stories grab your attention and never lets go. I got up very early in the mornings and read until I finished each book at night. If there was a rating higher than 5, I would rate the book at least a 10."
3,Good but not as good as I had hoped.,"When I first read the back of this book I thought ""wow this sounds like a great book."" I even thought that in the beginning because it starts off with a lot of humor and I thought the heroine and hero were going to be great adversaries for a while and then finally admit thier love for each other. That didn't happen. I liked the Hero, Jamie, but I found Jix, who is the supposedly impish heroine, a bore most of the time. I actually found the secondary characters of Griffin and Sam were more interesting. It was a good book but it didn't live up to its potential."
2,Jix spoils an otherwise good book....,"short and sweet-Jix's antics and dialog are ditzy and annoying to the point of headache forming. What started as cute quickly turned funky.Jix is spunky-but not without sacrificing a good deal of common sense! For example-she ""kidnaps"" her best friend by getting her on a plane under false pretenses, so she'll miss her wedding, doesn't truly explain why-then is surprised when her friend is so mad at her?!?I'll try another of this author's book, but I'd say skip this one.2 stars"
5,One of the most important books ever written!,"Although I disagree with a few of the exercises in this work (especially allowing beings to use your hand to write mediumistically), overall this text of self-development is one of the most important ever. It ranks with the exercises in Rudolf Steiner's work (although Steiner's meditations on plants are much safer overall) as the clearest path of development for those who are so inclined. Even if a person only progressed to stage 3 during a single lifetime, one has already taken an important first step. If you like this kind of thing, you might also enjoy the esoteric novel, ""The Shattering Light of Stars"" by Hicks."
3,The first part was helpful,"I found the first sections of the book to be helpful, but to me this is the modern world and I don't have the time to imagine every single race and animal. It basically tells you how to meditate and control your thoughts. I learned from that it was quite helpful. I couldn't get past the sections after that. I already have a great imagination but I guess this would be helpful for people to learn to visualize with their eyes. I think i just didn't understand this book after the first part, and it was too confusing."
5,Most Comprehensive Mind Training Manual,"This book is loaded from cover to cover with practical mind-training exercises - from developing the power of one's imagination, to training different senses and perfecting the ability to use them individually or in conjunction with each other; to working with the elements; transfering one's consciousness; generating and projecting energy; and much more. By the time you're done going thoroughly through all the exercises in this book and practicing them until you master them - your ability to use the power of your mind will increase beyond your wildest dreams - and you will have many interesting experiences along the way."
3,TOO WORDY,"I should have paid attention to the one who stated the book is too wordy. Maybe I was expecting something else due to the many positive stars this book received. Although some blame it on translation, for me, the problem with the book is it explains each detail of his theories to the tilt."
2,Disappointed,"I read all the positive reviews here and bought this book--but I'm disappointed. This is a very expensive book for what it is, and to me it wasn't worth it.Bardon is incredibly wordy and overly complicated in his language. If you want to sit down for an easy read on the occult and Hermeticism, this is not the book to do it with. This is the kind of book where you read a page from top to bottom, and then realize that you haven't taken a single piece of information from that whole thing.I turned away from Hermeticism after buying this book. I figured that a book called 'Initiation into Hermetics' would be a comfortable introduction to Hermeticism, but that wasn't the case. If you're new to this, I wouldn't recommend starting with this book."
1,Not worth the money,"It smelled good, but I did not buy it for the scent. I bought it because I thought it was more enviromentally friendly then what I could find on my grocery store shelf. Turns out the ingrediants are just about the same. I would not buy it again."
1,Not Pyle's work!,"Read the description more carefully than I did. It is NOT ""Ernie's War,"" which is a tremendous collection of Pyle's work. This is a mediocre biography. Do not waste time on this till you read Pyle's own work."
4,A Good Novel!,"This was quite an interesting book. The U.S. government decides to create an agency to battle imported drugs from Colombia.The name of this unit is ""Hammerheads"". Of course you have a favorite Dale Brown hero Ian Hardcastle. The drug lords have hired a Cuban general to lead their smuggling effort. There is plenty of high flying action in this book. The new unit is tried again and again. The drug lords through their Cuban general prove to be a worthy advesary. The state of Florida is under the gun in this book. If you like jets and airplanes this is your book. Buy it, it is a good read."
2,Really terrible,"I read it when it came out. It has stuck in my mind as a terrible technothriller. Actually, it ended my brief fling with technothrillers since I had already become disenchanted with Clancy. There is a lot of shock value in this, quite a bit of hurrahs, and generally just a bad idea central to the book.As usual, politics is poorly handled."
2,Too simplistic...,"The first book I read from Dale Brown, and I must say I am unimpressed. My foremost problem are the characters are given slight history but mostly glossed over for never ending episodes of action and skirmishes. There's not one character that truly stand out to like or hate. The family problems of the main character, Ian Hardcastle, is poorly developed, especially considering that his son is also using drugs.I sometimes think that this is Dale Brown just wrote this to cash in on the success of Tom Clancy's Clear and Present Danger. The solution of blockading Florida alone is still rather simplistic in my opinion. Certainly it will deal a major blow to South American cartels initially. I'm already thinking the Yakuzas and Triads might take over importing of drugs."
1,Yamabushi's mini reviews pt. XI,"The featured character here? The V-22 Osprey. What usually happens to V-22 Ospreys? They crash and burn, so does this book. This one ended it for me and Brown. Terrible."
4,The kids love it.,My kids are obsessed with tape. This was their dream toy. They can use the cutter at 3 and 5 yrs old. I don't think it's too sharp. The roller is not fitted very well. It slips out of one side. This may be just a flaw in the one I received.
5,Watch out!,"Note that this is the 3rd edition, which had deleted the historical references to 1948 Palestine which were in the 1st (B&W) & second (color) editions. This makes it less interesting. The earlier eds were more interesting because of their historical content, like the Blue Lotus. Unfortunately, I don't know where to find them."
2,"A lot of information, but not practical","This book goes over a lot of Jazz guitar, but the way it is presented is simply boring. It does not teach a useful way of learning chords and scales - he simply gives you a bunch of patterns and expects you to memorize it. The are much better books such as ones by Jim Scott, Bill Edwards, and Roger Edison. If I started with this book I would probably quit out of boredom or frustration"
5,A great way to learn,I applaud this book and its accompanying DVD most highly. It is well presented and most instructive. I am working actively on this at my own pace. It is helpful and enjoyable. I was so impressed with the material in book one and two after my initial review that I ordered the remaining two books from the publisher (only because they were not available on Amazon). I believe serious students will find this course most gratifying.
3,Great Intro to Jazz Guitar!,"I agree with the other reviewers on the content of the book. While some of the material in the beginning may be a little basic, it is clearly and concisely explained. The subsequent material is explained with the same clarity, and thoroughness. The sections on playing in various modes are particularly helpful. Great material!! I mistakenly rated the book/DVD down at a three because I didn't think the DVD included the audio tracks for the lesson and was frustrated. But thanks to another Amazon reviewer who straightened me out, I found them and am making great progress. Now if I could only figure out how to change my rating from 3 to 5 stars...."
2,Just a bunch of theory,"This book is about how to read and understand scales, build chords, and understand chord progressions. The ""playing"" aspect isn't there, even though there are a few simple songs sprinkled throughout.I really wanted a book that I could open in front of me and sit down with a guitar and a notebook and immerse myself in playing jazz guitar. This isn't that book. This is more of a dry, cold, classroom study on music theory.I don't mean to imply that this information is useless. Actually it's quite valuable. It's just that I want to play the guitar right now, and this book wants me to sit and think about scales and keys and chord progressions before I even touch the instrument. No good."
3,NO CD/DVD WITH THIS BOOK!,"Because music is perceived aurally, being able to hear the examples is most important. The Amazon description of this book mentions accompanying CD, but there is NONE! The following link is to the combo -Beginning Jazz Guitar (Book & DVD)"
2,Why I didn't like it,Was not what I expected.and I need to be careful what I buy. I know it wasn't a lot of money but it was my money.
3,Spark,"Although I like the 2 actor/actress in the lead roles... this movie is was not good... the script was too simple... you could basically call the ending... and the beginning... and the middle... not enough ""umph"" for the characters to hold on too!Grade C"
2,I receiveda PAL disk,"I got a PAL disc and not a NTSC disc which is I wanted,and now I'm in trouble with plying the disc..."
1,Choose a different one,I bought this set and am very dissappointed.. I did not get it at Amazon.. It takes 15-20 minutes for the curlers to heat.. the strips that are supposed to make it easy to curl cause problems with putting the clips in to hold the curler if they wind up in the wrong spot.. which happens most of the time. They are very hot to handle. They do produce great results if you can get past all the issues.
2,Hard to Use,"I owned this set for about 2 and a half years before I finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers (I used it about 4-5 times per year). First off, the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place, it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head. Second, the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair. Third, the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use. I would roll up my hair (which would take like, 30 minutes because of the difficulty), and if I walked around the house to watch TV while I waited for my hair to set, the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room. I eventually lost like 6 clips from the ""springing out"" thing.The results of these rollers were great, though. I used them on my wedding day and people loved it. Good results, but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers."
1,Waste of money,"I have used this Conair hairsetter for 3 months. The rollers take a very long time to heat - allow a half hour. The clips are too big for the rollers at the curved end and the rollers fall out easily - moments after putting them in. I use the clips from an old Clairol set that I had saved. And...though I have shiny curls upon removing the rollers, the curls fall out completely after an hour and my hair looks like it wasn't styled at all! I have wavy hair that's not hard to curl. I've owned ten sets of rollers over 30 years. This is the worst. What's up with this BAD product from Conair who are the granddaddys of hair appliances? I'm throwing them out and won't buy Conair again!"
3,Can you say tripe?,"A funny thing happened on my way to becoming a physician. I met a man under a rock...This film takes a lot of concentration to watch. I am not sure how they talked known actors into performing in this film. The setting looks like they made the film in a basement. They indiscriminately mix the names of gods and pharos to whatever sounds good for a 1950's Hollywood movie. The dialog seems to have come from one of those magic 8 balls. It is truly a large land where no two accents are alike. And cute cuddly Ustinov distracts for the non-existent plot. At least John Carradine played himself. Victor Mature added some dignity to the movie as HoreMheb.If you are really interested in Egyptian films from this era try ""Land of the Pharaohs"" (1955)And if you want to read about Akhenaton try ""Oedipus and Akhnaton Myth and History"" by Immanuel VelikovskyLand of the PharaohsOedipus and Akhnaton - Myth and History - The tragic events in the life of the royal house of hundred-gated Thebes"
2,They missed the point,"In the true Fifties Hollywood spirit, this film seems to miss the point of the original book entirely. The strongest theme throughout the book was how lust for power can corrupt anyone - even the closest of your friends.However, the Hollywood dream weavers wanted to play it easy for the audience, and turned it into an inane sanctimonial hallelujah - and poorly even as that. The acting is stiff, the dialogue just plain corny, and the storytelling bland.The bookwriter Mika Waltari's popularly acknowledged masterpiece deserves a much better film than this."
4,Flawed but well worth watching,"I think it's a mistake to simply dismiss this movie as a ""ponderous soaper"" (or whatever Maltin called it). To begin with you have this great ensemble cast, good cinematography and a rich and moving musical score. The plot has some interesting twists and maintains a good balance between drama and humor. Peter Ustinov is particularly good as the conniving but lovable servant. Look for a great (but short) scene with John Carradine as the grave robber. I had no trouble with Bella Darvi's dialogue and she seemed seductive enough to me! True there are some bad hair moments (which you really must temper with the period during which the film was made)but there are also some really great and moving scenes. On the balance I would recommend this one for a watch."
2,Insipid,"I think that pretty much defines this movie. After watching this movie, I do have a hard time coming up with much I like about it. If you are interesting in seeing something good of this type with Jean Simmons in it, see ""The Robe.""The plotline and acting of this movie is consistent with all the movies of this type. The story goes slowly and there are a lot of things that just don't add up.I understand others will have differing opinions, and that is OK, but if you are interested in a solid story with solid acting that's reasonably historically accurate (and in the Biblical genre) then look for ""The Bible Series"" videos from TNT/Lux that include great ones like ""Moses,"" ""Solomon,"" ""David,"" and others."
1,Boring beyond words!,"An utterly horrendous and fatally miscast movie. Marlon Brandowas supposed to play the lead, but wisely bailed out of thisill-conceived affair. With some of the most ridiculous andponderous monologues in film history, I guess this is a masterpiece of sorts. The only pleasant moment consist ofwatching Gene Tierney for a few minutes cultivating the artof Archery!The perfect holiday gift for someone you really dislike!"
2,"Endless, endless, endless","This movie seemed to go on forever. The main character's ""speech"" at the end was particularly tiresome. And the dialog! Did ancient Egyptians actually talk like this ?"
5,"An Excellent, Must-See Movie for All Ages!","The Egyptian is a wonderful movie about a young doctor, Sinuhe. Many people don't like this movie because of the historical inaccuracy, but then again, most movies aren't anyway. Remember Titanic? This film displays good morals and values, and has it's comical moments. You will laugh and cry at the characters. My personal favorites were Baketamun, and Nefer. Both displayed major girl power! I beg you to watch this movie. It trully is a great classic! I'm reading the book right now, by Mika Waltari. It is incredibly good! If you hate the movie, you will enjoy the book, because it is almost historically accurate, and it is more interesting."
5,One of my top ten films for the era,"THE EGYPTIAN: where Edmund Perdum made his debut as the main star; had a ton of big names; Gene Tierney, Victor Mature, Peter Ustinov, Gene Simmons....cameo by John Carradine...and the Pharoah was played by one of Elizabeth Taylor's husbands at the time.....lofty designs on the Egyptian cities of old.....research went into making this realistic. One of those Epic pictures you never forget at the start, wrestling with divinity of self over sacrifice."
5,An interesting read,"The is not strictly a shotokan book. There are chapters covering Okinawan history and the karate men of the 1800s. The book offers radical theories on karate's beginnings and the changes made over time. Although I don't agree with many of the author's conclusions, some of which are nothing more than pure speculation,--whether we agree or not, he is entitled-- I still found it an interesting read.Note.Among others, there are several pages on Itosu and Chotoku Kyan.----------------------------------------------A. Bustillo"
4,Great book,"This was a great book on karate history. It presents some good information on karate bunkai, althought it is sometimes far-fetched. In the last cahpter is states karate is no longer a useful art, which contridicts itself as earlier it states karate is effective. It also does not strive to explain the purpose of the karate higate-to pull an opponent to you while you hit them (close in fighting). All in all it was a great book"
5,A Great Read,"A good insight with some interesting ideas on how this great art came about. It goes hand in hand with what I have been teaching for years, when others come up with siliar concepts it validates what you have been doing all your life."
3,Less adventurous but consistent nonetheless,"Solid late night electric jazz guitar trio entry, but nothing out of the ordinary and in fact a little more ordinary then other releases. The vibe can be predictably mellow, but there are enough sprinklings of integrity to make this as worthy a consideration."
5,Pirate Pencil Toppers,This item was exactly as described. The order was processed promptly and arrived sooner than expected.
2,Boring and biased writing,I bought this book to get a glimpse into why communism collapsed - book is full of biased writing. author seems to be a believer in communism and blames people in charge of its implementation for its failure. author also alleges communism cant be labeled a failed ideology as yet. read this if you want to put yourself through the torture of reading through very dry and often repititive arguments.
5,Sword Guru,This book is exactly what the title says it is. It truly is a comprehensive guide to various japanese swords detailing the types and nomenclature of the swords.
3,Not my favorite toy!,"My son seems to like this toy, although I bought it last week for $$ and this week it is marked down to le$$. The toy was not assembled at all and took quite a bit of time to assemble. It is really a nuissance toy because the hatch does not open easily (even for an adult) and requires my poor child to come to me every time he wants to open the hatch. If I would have paid less $, it would have been somewhat understandable. I expected more for the $$ I guess."
4,Batawesome,"Realy I like this toy , and is incredible, because never thought to find a Batman beyond batmobile in an excellent condition, when I opened the box looks like if the time had stoped. This toy has around 12 or 13 years and I,m really luky to have one of them. = )"
1,Batplane-not what it should be!,"I bought one of these for my 3 year old. The wings were so difficult to get on we sent it back. When the second one arrived we had the same problem. The wings are made so poorly, it impossible for them to stay on. After the 2nd one, I am returing it for a refund."
2,Not a good buy,"toy was difficult to assemble (the instruction set was pathetic). it is not very durable. specifically, the back latch of wing never really catches so the wing continually falls off. the latch is difficult to open. i would not buy this again."
5,Great Wires!,Don't waste your time with aftermarket wires. These are cheaper on Amazon and fit/work perfect.
4,quick read,This was a fun quick read. Just very light. This was my first book by this author and I enjoyed it.
4,HUMANS - NOT DOLLS,Another enjoyable Scumble River Mystery. This time Skye is involved in the Murder of a couple. The couple is very affluent and the wife sells Instant Gourmet dinners. The husband is a doctor who has extremely loose morals. Skye is still torn between Wally and Simon. Fun Sunday afternoon read.
4,"THESE ARE HUMANS, NOT DOLLS",Another enjoyable Scumble River Mystery. This time Skye is involved in the Murder of a couple. The couple is very affluent and the wife sells Instant Gourmet dinners. The husband is a doctor who has extremely loose morals. Skye is still torn between Wally and Simon. Fun Sunday afternoon read.
5,one of the most uplifting cd's i have ever heard.,"This cd is a God send. It is such an inspiration to me and mine. I especially love number 8 on this album. I was very ill in february of 1997 after giving birth to a baby girl. And this song let me know that its not over until Almighty GOD says it is over and when he does you just have to let it be. I played that song for my mother who was ill with lung cancer rest her soul she passed away july 18, 1998 and i miss her dearly, but she just cried after hearing that song and i did with her. but it helps me everyday to understand that God is a loving God and he doesn't put anymore on us than we can bear. So i just praise God for your music."
1,worst rubbish ever,"It's about as miserable as possible, both as literary criticism and as history. Worst reading of the sonnets ever, and that is quite a remarkable achievement. A cringe-inducing embarrassment."
3,The wrong biographer for Tolkien,"Sadly, Carpenter's standard biography of Tolkien is written by a man wholely unsympathetic with Tolkien's life work and beliefs. As a result, while many of the facts are more or less correct, the spin given them gives an inaccurate picture of this very real, very human man. Pearce's biography, _Tolkien: Man and Myth_ ought to be read along side Carpenter's work for a more accurate picture."
3,falls apart in the last few pages,"This book could be divided into two: one documenting the story of his personal and professional lives, the othe explaining the history and development of his mythology. The first part is interesting. The second part seems to fall short in satisfying the reader, almost as if there are patches of information that are left out. The first half makes the read worthwhile, however."
3,A not so Catholic Perspective on a wonderful Catholic Man,"Though this book covers the essentials of what happens in Tolkien's life, it gives very poor insight into the man himself. It is clear that the book is written by someone who just doesn't understand what it is to live as a faithful Catholic. The author's explanations for why things might of happened and his constant treatment of Tolkien's family as in the way or a hindrance to his writing, shows a distinctly non-Catholic sense of priorities. He also tends to psychologize too much. From reading Tolkien's letters, I could tell how wrong the perspective in this book is. They show that Tolkien was a faithful Catholic and a loving and committed family man (the two must go hand in hand after all). It is a shame that someone who understands so little of the joy and beauty of Tolkien's faith was his biographer."
3,Not Essential,"Reading this book reminded me why Tolkien found fault with the trend of literary biography. The key to understanding a writer is understanding the life of his mind. Humphrey Carpenter's book contributes nothing in this regard. Those who want to understand Tolkien the philologist and sub-creator are strongly advised to read Tom Shippey's ""The Road to Middle Earth"" and ""Author of the Century.""What you will find in this book is the story of the rather ordinary life of an academic. Of interest, certainly, is the genesis of the Lord of the Rings as an offshoot of Tolkien's life-long opus The Silmarillion. But the book is a survey, rather than an intellectual inquiry. As such, I would not call it an essential work for the Tolkien enthusiast."
5,inspiring biography of Tolkien,"This very well written account of Tolkiens life as a boy, a husband, writer and professor takes you away from where you are into the heart of Tolkien's being. It covers his writtings in depth, the making of languages, of peoples, of maps. But also his academic life, Beowulf, the Islandic Saga, the inklings, his relationship with C.S. Lewis, his day-to-day habits, his children, his religion. It breathes a wonderful inspiring atmosphere. I've read is several times now, and it still enchants me.This biography is a gem in its own right. You won't regret buying it."
4,Tolkien's life story,"I think the biography is not very well written, which is a pity - Tolkien's life is full of interesting details (especially for LOTR fans, of course) which could have been described in a much more engaging way. Carpenter took a lot of shortcuts. It's almost like he didn't proofread his work or didn't have an editor - some canned phrases repeat word for word in different parts of the book. Also he is clearly not a linguist, and his description of Tolkien's work is sometimes plainly wrong. But still the book is not bad to read, and if you're interested in facts, you should give it a go"
5,A good read,"Timothy Zahn is one of my favorite authors. This was a really fun read, while not quite as good as Angelmass."
2,Uninspired mystery and adventure,"This is my first book by Zahn and I was pretty underwhelmed. I was surprised at the lack of creativity overall, it feels like a TV episode. The main character is cast from the Han Solo mold whose business is smuggling and comes complete with an alien co-pilot . The other characters are even shallower and you find yourself differentiating them by name alone. Although there is a murder onboard a small ship early in the novel, it takes nearly 400 pages to finally reveal the fairly obvious perpetrator and the author does unconvincing backflips to keep the mystery going this long. There really are only a couple of suspects. In the end, I really couldn't have cared less about the Icarus secret (it's a textbook MacGuffin) and I sort of giggled at some of the other revelations. I hope this isn't one of Zahn's best."
5,A Great Book,"The Incarus Hunt is one of those books you can't seem to be able to put down! It has great suspense and a great story line. Both sifi and mystery readers alike will enjoy this book. I would also incourage you to read his Star Wars books, also great works, but I still think this one is his best."
4,Good airplane reading,"Entertaining and full of action, with a snazzy ending. If you're looking for a book to help you grow personally, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a few hours of relaxation and fun, this book is for you."
3,At least I got threw it.,"The entire book could have been half the size if it wasn't in first person. This way we wouldn't have to listen to Jorden's babbling in his mind. I nearly put it down several times because of this. As far as the ending, It's ok to have twists and turns like in ""The dark beyond the stars"" but this ending had no hint of this through the entire book. It looked like Zahn ran out of steam and couldn't figure out how to end it. I did enjoy the friendship and slight humor between Jorden and Ixil."
1,Disappointing,"Perhaps just people from Washington did not like this book or.........I have to agree with Mr. Klausner's review of this book. I was very disappointed. I had the murderer pegged in this ""mysterious"" plot with the introduction of Jordan McKell's partner as the new ship mechanic. I found that the spaceport scenes were used over and over with slight variations. In addition to this there seemed to be a never ending contradiction with the main character....one moment he is sly as a fox and the next he is a bumbling idiot. Last but not least, th ending was pure cheesy ""Here comes the cavalry all at once with 2 minutes planning"" type of thing which made me want to throw this book across the room.Mr. Zahn - do not get angry. I suggest you run your next mystery through an editor or a couple of friends and take suggestions regarding content or plausability before you publish the next one.Regards,"
2,Science?,"This book is a mediocre mystery/detective novel cloaked in bad science fiction. The characters live in a futuristic world with very advanced star drives, but have no DNA sampling devices, no cameras on the ship, a computer that is comparable to what was commercially available in the 1990s. The word ""science"" is just an excuse for a book written to make money. Good English does not make a good book."
1,Boring and Tedious,"Thought from the cover this could be interesting. Turned out to be predictable, cliched, full of stupid characters and barely made and effort to push the limits science. Dashing about in space ships happens in each SF novel and Mr Zahn really has to try harder to make his book more than a whodunnit with laser beams. I shall not read any more of his 'novels' for really; Novel they are not!"
5,Excellent Sci-Fi/Mystery Story,"It's very well-written and an excellent addition to any Science Fiction (or even a mystery) fan's library. I don't tend to like 1st person POV's in stories, so I was skeptical at first of the decision to write ""Icarus Hunt"" as a 1st person POV, but as the story progressed, I couldn't imagine it being written any other way."
2,Politically correct jargon ruins the reading,"Mr Zahn draws a plausable plot with reasonable attention to the characters. Unfortunately he seems to feel compelled to lay on a heavy dose of p.c., for example ""crewmen' becomes ""crewers""-- reminds me of the same people who gave us ""servepersons"". What not just tell a tale; is there really such a pressing need to make us all more ""sensitive""?"
2,Entertaining but ultimately disappointing science fiction.,"Timothy Zahn's THE ICARUS HUNT is, for the most part, anentertaining tale aimed at the ""hard science fiction"" reader-- but ultimately its ending (complete with a concealed set of facts that left this reader snarling in baffled annoyance) disappoints. Contrary to what some other reviews in this forum suggest, it is *not* like STAR WARS, save for its interweaving of humans and aliens as in the famed ""Cantina bar."" It has plenty of good ideas, and lots of plot twists ... and yet its resolution is at once too neat and profoundly implausible. And those pesky concealed facts make a fraud out of much of the novel's set-up, including much of what gives the book its initial charm and interest."
4,a very good sci-fi mystery book.,"I would like to start out by saying kudos to Timothy Zahn for somehow managing to tell a first person mystery novel, where the exact idendinty of the narrorator is a large part of the mystery, and making this somehow work out in a belivable manner. The novel is about two smugglers who are trying to transport a mysterous ship back to earth aginst the wishes of the galaxies most powerfull race. Zahn agian shows his talent for writing very entertaining novels within rather thin worlds. He has written some of the only good star wars novels (Sorry but Star Wars is best left on the wide screen), and uses a similar type of universe for this book."
4,Pix and Pax: You'll Like the Furballs,"Ixil, McKell's alien partner, alone is worth reading The Icarus Hunt for. McKell's sardonic devil-may-care narrative was a riot, even though I'm not fan of first person tales. Typical Zahn, ingenious, entertaining, hard sf. He never asks you to believe the improbable and always keeps you reading. Go for it."
4,fine even if you don't like sci-fi,"My husband and two of my sisters-in-law love science fiction. Me, not so much. ""The Icarus Hunt"" is the sci-fi book for people who don't like sci-fi, much as the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich is the mystery series for people who hate mysteries.What Timothy Zahn has created is basically a gumshoe novel based in space. His characterization is wonderful, and the plot is more than satisfying. I've recommended this book to just about everyone I know.And, you sci-fi fans, my husband -- a certified sci-fi geek -- loved this novel, too."
4,Mystery wearing Sci-Fi clothes,"Zahn is an excellent Sci-Fi writer and this book doesn't disappoint. He creates an excellent universe and a great set of characters. The book could easily be the lead story in a fascinating series. However, this book isn't Sci-Fi in its purest form. It's more a murder mystery wearing Sci-Fi clothes. So if you enjoy both Sci-Fi and Mysteries, this is the book for you."
4,My storytime group loved this book!,"If you've been wondering what happened to Peef since Santa found a home for him, this book will bring you up to date. He has had some big adventures and is a little worse for the wear but he is very happy with his life. This teaches a good lesson for children: You are okay just the way you are; you don't need to look like what others may consider ideal. The lesson here for parents is that you need to let go and let kids be themselves. This second Peef book is shorter than the first one and my preschoolers love it."
2,"RUN OF THE MILL THRILLS, SAVED BY STARS","""Shadow of Doubt"" sounded very intriguing on its back cover. To boot, it also starred Melanie Griffith and Tom Berenger. It's a classy production, great visuals, dialogue and interesting story. The thriller is about a laywer (Griffith) who is defending a young man accused of raping and killing a young woman. She believes the man is innocent, unlike fellow lawyer, Tom Berenger. Soon a politician's family gets wound up in the murders, and the lawyer must seek out information. Craig Sheffer (A River Runs Through It) also stars as a past client of Griffith's, who is a former raper too. Singer, Huey Lewis also stars in the film as does James Morrison and John Ritter (Bride of Chucky). You have seen all this before in films like ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""The Gingerbread Man"", but this one suffers because it's just too long, causing you to fall alseep after half way.zzzzzzzzzzzzzz......"
1,"Good cast but dopey script, stupid characters.","I enjoy almost anything Melanie Griffith is in, but this one was too silly and unbelievable. Her character is supposed to be a smart, tough lawyer but she does everything that would either get a real lawyer disbarred, laughed out of court -- or killed. Beautifully shot, great sets and locations, but everybody is wasted in this dopey script. Nina Foch is a GREAT witchy woman, but I missed John Ritter completely (fooled by the beard)and had to rewind to catch his scene in the very beginning."
2,A remake of Dumb & Dumber????,"Melanie Griffith must've been strapped for money when she agreed to do this film. While she is quite good in it and credible in the role, her character does such stupid things -- not very smart for a supposedly smart lawyer. In an effort to catch a murderer, she actually allows the guy she knows to be the vicious killer into her house...at night...alone...and, of course, no lights are lit so that said killer can jump out at her/us and go ""Boo!""Well, let me go ""Boo!"" This film is too dumb to be believed."
2,"Not well researched...but overall, not terrible.","There are many decent articles in this encyclopedia and the photography included with them is good quality. However, I had a difficult time getting past the fact that this encyclopedia includes outdated and erroneous information. I found several historical and zoological info errors after reading through just a few articles. I expected better from an ""encyclopedia."""
4,Simple and Easy for the Quick and Dirty,"These are a little thin for a polished-looking business card, but if you just need something quick they work great. I print them on an HP CP2025, and printing both sides doesn't deform them or cause them to break apart. My only complaint is occasionally I'll find a sheet or two that do not want to break apart cleanly, but it's usually only five sheets or less out of 100 sheets, so I trim them with a paper-cutter."
4,"Good basic business cards, don't love new ""clean-edge"" technology","These are very good business cards, work with the standard 8371 template.Compared to the old version, I don't like these quite as well because the new, fancy design (intended to give clean edges) can actually make it much easier to end up with tacky-looking tears if you bend it the wrong way (or, sometimes, the right way).Honestly I doubt that this would bother most people as much as it bothers me, and I still will be reordering these in the future because of the large quantity and good price."
5,Business Cards,Thank you for the quick delivery of the Avery business card. We are a non for profit housing homelss and transitional veterans. These cards help us get the word out about our self funded program. thanks
1,Avery 8471 Business Card,"I received the product ( Avery 8471 Inkjet White Business Cards in about 7 days and what appeared to be in good to new condition. Upon opening the box, which still had the original seal, the products were warped, damp and musty........ I used three sheets and had to print one sheet at a time and due to the warp, the cards did not go thru the printer as they should have. I did notify the seller and have not heard any word as of yet........ I will not buy from the seller again and I have learned a lesson......if you want new or near new.....buy newJ T"
3,A Tackle Box is better!,"The GI Joe Footlocker is one of those things that every GI Joe kid should have so he can sort out his GI Joe gear. This footlocker brings some grenades, a handgun, and some other gear. Not much gear for the price. While a real wooden military footlocker would be a great collectible heirloom for anyone to have, this is not it. The modern GI Joe Footlockers are rather plain plastic boxes, and for the about the same price, you can get a larger fishing tackle box with more compartments for the little grenades, guns, etc."
5,My Grandson loved his GI Joe footlocker,I bought the footlocker for my 6 year old grandson and he was so happy with it none of his playmates had ever seen one. I looked for it because his Dad had one with his GI Joes when he was about the same age. Now my other Grandson age 12 would like one for his birthday in November.
5,My opinion,I think all the products I bought are very fun.They are very educational from my point of view.I'm only 12 years old and I am in the 6 grade.All products are pretty strong. My dad likesthe products too! One thing I think isn't toogood is on the humvee or other wise hummer.I think the back pice that holds the trunk doorup is weak and bends easily. It could break.Don't worry it still is in one pice.
2,For Older Kids,"I bought this as a gift for my friend's son, who was turning 5. His dad is a marine, and I thought this would be neat. His mom was horrified! She said it was way to realistic. Neither she nor I are against kids have toy guns, but in my opinion, they need to look like toys, not so realistic. Perhaps this is better for an older child, but for a 5 year old, this toy was not really a toy."
1,Make sure to read the fine print.,"I recently ordered this movie, and realized it would not play in any of our DVD players. I returned the movie and asked for another. They company responded by telling me it will not run in DVD players found in the US. They told me that information was in the description for the movie on their website. I went back and looked, and the information is there. However, it was below the write-up for the movie. Pay attention if you buy anything from this site. I never knew that DVD's could be formatted for different countries. They company would not refund any of the shipping costs, which werevmore than the movie by the end of the whole return process."
2,To much black humor and slapstick comedy.,"This movie was so stupid that I only watched four times. That's rigth I bougth the damn movie, I watched the movie four times, one was for when I bougth it, one for Christmas, one for my cousins and the other for my brother, guess what happen? the first time was funny, second time it was to cruel for a Christmas movie (better buy Muppet Christmas Carol), the third I was bored, the last time I saw I sweared I'll never watched again and it is thanks to the pitiful performances of Nathane lane and his sidekick Lee Evans. The mouse was the cutest thing of the whole movie, and the music was above average by Alan Silvestri (Back To The Future, Ferngully:The Last Rainforest)but the movie and actors need more interesting dialogue, my brother almost cry because the stupid ass brothers tried to kill a cute mouse, if I'm gonna watch black comedy, I prefer watching Death Becomes Her instead, as for the slapstick will be Flubber."
2,Is it over YET??!,"My husband received this as a Christmas gift from someone at his work. They had a mouse loose in their office for awhile before Christmas, so it seemed an appropriate gift. We could have left it at that and it would have been such a great gift. But, we had to open it and watch it. I could barely stand to watch after about 30 - 45 minutes. The brothers inherit a house worth millions and slowly destroy the house trying to catch a mouse. The mouse was cute and you cheered for the safety of the mouse, but the constant trying to catch the mouse and destroying the house at the same time got to be too much for me. I gave the movie 2 stars because it had a couple of funny moments and it semi-redeemed itself with a cute ending. But, I will not be watching this movie again."
1,GOOD MOVIE!! VERY VERY BAD SERVICE DONT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!,I BAUGHT 2 MOVIES ON THE SAME DAY FROM THIS PLACE AND ONE WAS SENT OFF ALREADY AND IVE BEEN WAITING FOR 6 DAYS NOW FOR THEM TO SEND OFF THE OTHER?????? Y IS IT SO HARD TO SEND 2 DIFFERENT MOVIES THAT U SELL TO ONE PLACE????? SO BEACUSE OF THIS IM NEVER GOIN TO SHOP HERE AGAIN AND IM GOIN TO TELL EVERYONE I KNOW NOT TO GO THREW U AND ILL MAKE IT MY GOAL IN LIFE TO MAKE SURE YOUR STORE DONT GET AND BISNESS BECAUSE U DONT KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE CUSTOMER HAPPY.SO IF I WAS EVERYONE DONT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE UNLESS U WANT UR STUFF TO SHOW UP AT UR HOUSE MONTHS AFTER U HAVE BAUGHT IT.
2,Alright,"While the movie had it's funny parts, it also had it's dry spots. The movie was good, and the idea was excellent. There were just too many spots where I actually lost IQ points for watching them."
5,squeakily enjoyable..,"Wow.. did not think i would enjoy this movie at first, but it isa great film. Laughs and smiles all the way through. Well mademovie for sure. Highly recommended!"
5,Good service,"I received good customer service from Amazon. I had surfed the net for several days for this viedo, and the only place that had it available was Amazon. Keep up the good customer service Amazon."
1,MOUSETRAP,My grandson & I love this movie so i purchased it for us. Was very dissapointed that the movie doesnt play. We tried it on 4 different dvd players & there is no movie. Unfortunately i didnt keep my packing slip to return it since i never considered the movie wouldnt play!! I will purchase from somewhere else
2,The mouse is the only reason to watch this.,"While looking around for a video, I rented this because it looked different and cute. Too bad it was different though, because I didn't really like it as much as I thought I would (I love cute movies). Most of the jokes are obviously meant for kids, but some of them made me laugh. The two brothers are obnoxious at times, and totally ruined the movie for me. They are just plain stupid. Sure, it's great for laughs, but it was tiring to look at, an it was predictable humor. How many times will you laugh at brothers constantly ""accidentally"" hitting each other with whatever they find? And why would they include the few swear words in the movie anyway? This is a kids movie and it wasn't necessary at all. Overall, I was very disappointed. Thank the cute little mouse for the 2 stars."
4,This movie is funny!,"I watched this film expecting a dumb kids movie but I was suprised. It's darker than you would expect from a family film, and a lot more creative. It gets a little silly a times, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. On the whole, I would recommend it."
2,"Starts off well, but looses it's way.","Mouse Hunt starts off well, but is ruined by a second half that is out of sync with the rest of the movie. Right from the start it's obvious that Mouse Hunt isn't going to be great, however the first half is handled pretty well. But by the second half it looses it's way and goes downhill from there on.Mouse Hunt is about two guys trying to get rid of a mouse out of a mansion. But the idea wears thin after a while and the jokes run out about halfway.Mouse Hunt has it's moments but for the most part, it's a bit pointless. However, kids will find it amusing."
1,Do not be fooled this is not appropriate for children.,"I just rented this movie off the kids shelf at my local video store. After ten minutes of watching my child has now seen a corpse catapulted into a sewer, various acts of milder violence, and a man eat a coach roach, throw it up, his children then try to kill it, and he dies of a massive coronary. 10 MINUTES!!!!I for one will be asking the video store to move this movie, it is not appropriate for family watching.For adults it is funny in the same way the end of Monty Python's meaning of life is. If you enjoy disturbingly dark comedy, by all means buy it."
1,"Please, spare me!","Another SLOW movie. I thought this was going to be a good one, because of Lane and Walken, and Walken was his usual psychotic self (but funny) but Lane was just plain unlikable and hostile. He doesn't play that well. He plays mischevious well. He plays con artists well. He cannot be downright nasty convincably. The best thing about this wasn't even Walken (see my nick? I'm biased.) but the stupid mouse! Save yer money...heck, save yer library card. Stay away from this one. YAWN!"
1,pretty pitiful,"this movie was da pits. as a 12 year old child I would say that this movie is for maybe 3 years old kids and under. A very old plot a cute trouble maker outs marting the big ""bad guys"" it was weak and I barley got through it"
1,first of all let me say that if there was a .oooooo1 star...,"This movie is on the same level as 'Mars attacks', 'Dead Presidents', and rotten banana peels, wich will hopefully be the bottom of garbage can. I didn't expect this flick to be any good, I'm not stupid, but I am sure that seeing it one more time would be worse torture than the rack, or one of Uncle Bernie's hugs. who but a smiling idiot like that one director what's his face,could that chocking on half a coackroach, dead bodies falling into sewers, and the so forth etc. is funny? I ask you this as a living being,please respect your intellegece and the intellegence of those around you!"
4,Good clean fun!,"If you like mayhem brought on by a cute fuzzy creature, this is a fun movie. I don't recall seeing so much destruction caused by such a small critter in a long time. There's lots of good slapstick by Nathan Lane and Lee Evans, a well-known English comedian. Christopher Walken is also memorable in this film as a pest exterminator. I think I also know, now, where some of the premise behind this past summer's hit ""Ratatouille"" came from..."
5,Mouse Hunt!!!,Great movie from my childhood. Acting is fantastic and is an overall great family movie that entertains all ages. I had this on VHS and just had to buy it on DVD.
5,hilariouas for 8yrs olds,"The movie can definetly be funny, if you watch it from start till end, just follow the flow of the movie and be ready to be comically entertained."
5,Favorite movie,My kids belly laughed as they finally are old enough to enjoy the humor. Christopher Walken has the funniest cameo in this and is so worth watching just for his cameo. Lee Evans is such a talented actor- watch Funny Bones with Jerry Lewis and Oliver Platt. Excellent movie too!
4,A movie for all the family,"Mousehunt is the kind of children's movie adults can watch with the youngsters. It actually works on two different levels. The slapstick and the cute mouse will thrill the young, while the old can enjoy the amazing and slightly dark art direction (Tim Burton flashback!) and some hilarious performances (Christopher Walken is unreal!). The movie does lose it in the end, but by then, the viewer has had so much to laugh about already, that it can be forgiven. Also, the DVD is of exceptional quality, with nice menus and decent extras. Way to go Dreamworks, keep up the good work."
3,2 grown comedians chased in unknown territory by a mouse...,"The settings and the directory is exeptionally well made and draws you into the plot of the movie from the very start.While the comedy itself is of a smaller scale you have to be amuzed if you just stop to read between the lines and have a little imagination about what these two guys are going trough to demolish this mouse, ending up demolishing a 4 stories Mansion out somewhere in nowhere... Im laughing just thinking about it.The comedy is much like Home Alone in the sense of ""territory"", where in this case a mouse outsmarts the intruders with rather painfull solutions to the them. They are all over but the mouse escapes with even a little bit of luck.Not a must own but definetly worth a watch."
1,Horrible,"This movie is grotesque and cruel. The movie is incredibly mean. (i have a soft spot for animals.) Watching a coffin fall into a sewer, look at a man throw up a cockroach, and see a sewer system explode in people's faces is not my kind of movie. I used to cry every time the Alperts commercial (the one with the old man and the bed folding up on him) came on, so im suprised i didn't throw a fit when i saw this movie."
1,Very Boring,"My friend had been talking about this movie forever so oneday I rented it. I was vry dissappointed. It was about two brothers who own a house that is worth millions. So they spend millions renovating. One problem, there is a mouse that wont go away so they wrek the house trying to get at the mouse. This movie never got to the point, it was very boring."
3,"Not bad, but not really that great either.","For those of you familiar with Frank Zappa and his music, this isn't a bad buy. Its a must have for Zappaphiles. And for those who don't know squat about Zappa's music, this isn't the best place to start. The band is lead by Ike Willis, followed by familiar faces from past Zappa bands encompassing the 70s and 80s with no members from the Mothers of Invention participating. The performance is mearly adequate and at sometimes sloppy, but I'm from the school of any Zappa is good Zappa."
2,Not so much fun withoyt Frank,While its always great to hear Zappa's music played by great musicians (and these are great players) the whole affair seems lifeless and a bit dull. The band is not rehearsed nearly as well as when Z was alive and touring and it never really breaks loose into good chaotic fun the way the Baby Snakes performances do. I think a necessary component for Z's music played live was Frank himself - a kind of zen ringmaster.I probably won't watch this one again.
2,A Tribute to the Music of Frank Zappa,Too old of a concert thought this was something done now! will never watch again. didn`t sound good either
5,"Great, been using this perfume oil for years and years.","Great. Hmm, it say that 19 more words are required? Why is that? I wasn't really wanting to do anything but give a Star rating"
4,"Great selection, one flaw","The quotes and aphorisms in the Viking Book of Aphorisms are book are well-chosen and brilliant. It's a great book to leave on a table somewhere, so you and guests can open it to a random page, read a few quotations, and then put it down. Sometimes it's hard to put down! I own a few other quotation and aphorism books, and I was happy to see that this one is filled with quotations that I hadn't seen in other collections. Unfortunately, this one does not list the works from which the quotations are sourced - it only lists the writers' last names!If you don't already own any aphorism books, a better choice is theOxford Book of Aphorisms. Or, for those with cynical minds, TheCassell Dictionary Of Cynical Quotations. These two list the source works, too."
4,Dehumidifier hose,"We bought this hose for use on a basement dehumidifier. The hose comes with washers which allowed for a leak free hook up and was the perfect length. The reason I deducted a star is due to the stiffness of the hose. I am not sure if it is due to the fact it is a drinking safe hose, but its is extremely stiff compared to a garden hose. We were eventually able to get the hose to straighten out, allowing for easy drainage. As a hose it works well. No leaks have been detected and it was easy to set up. The metal connections seem of higher quality compared to the plastic connections found at our local stores."
1,"Item has a PLASTIC connector, not metal as pictured","I bought this connector to hook up a pet water bowl to an outside standpipe. When it arrived I didn't immediately notice that the connector was made of yellow plastic rather than metal but I sure found out as soon as I hooked it up. It leaked right away. I unhooked it to check that the gasket was making a good seal (it wasn't) and then tried to reconnect it. That's when the plastic thread got shredded and after that it would not go on straight so it's useless. I went to Lowe's and bought a similar one that did have metal connections and that's working fine.To their credit, Amazon gave me a refund with no quibbles."
2,Hose De-laminated,"Hose is not yet leaking at connections, but it is bulging badly in the middle and I can see where water has gotten outside of the white casing and into the clear casing. It is merely a matter of [short] time before this breaks. I have already ordered a new replacement item. I don't feel this is a durable item mean for its intended purpose. I purchased less than one year ago an it has been used about 2 months. I also have a pressure valve on my Airstream."
2,Not as pictured,"I know this was a cheaper option for a fresh water hose, but the one I received had a yellow plastic female fitting, not the metal fitting pictured. I've never had very good luck with plastic hose fittings - I hope this one work better than I expect..."
5,Awesome Food Quality Hose,I use this hose to fill food quality water drums next to my water treatment unit. Great price and quality. I wish it came with a cap to seal the hose. I bought a 3/4 inch PVC pipe cap to keep insects from entering hose when not in use. works fine.
5,"A hose is a hose, but this one is priced right & good size.","This is hose is perfect for an RV or as I bought it for an automatic refillable dog bowl. The water tastes fresh & not rubbery as with some hoses, but don't expect more than what it is- It's a hose!"
4,It Was Pretty Good Despite What Others Say...,"I recently caught this when it was on cable at 3am. Unable to sleep at that time, I put the tv on just as the opening credits came on. As soon as I saw Gregory Peck & Susan Hayward's names I knew I had to watch it. It was a good story with great acting & I was glued to the set. Sadly, if this story were made today it wouldn't be anywhere near as good & would be panned by critics. If only there were actors of the caliber of Gregory Peck & Susan Hayward today. This is a movie I would gladly watch again."
3,Significant Creative License,"A great film of it's era; Gregory Peck is always wonderful to behold. However, be aware of the fictional parts of the story told here. Take it as entertainment and some insight into Jerusalem, culture and David's life in 1000 BC. But recognize the parts that are fiction and believe the story as told in the Bible."
5,David and Bathsheba,I got up from a sick bed to see this movie back in 1952; it was worth it. I do not tire of these epic movies.
4,Nice epic for 1951...,"Good chemistry between Greg Peck and Susan Hayward. If only they could have kissed in 1951 the way on-screen kissing takes place now, the movie would have melted the silver screen from the heat...But back then Lord Hayes did rule in the Kingdom of Hollywood...cutting and slashing as he went...(sigh)."
3,A bit stiff but a must if you like the story or Peck.,"All in all the script and the acting are a bit on the stiff side in this Biblical romance. Peck and Hayward have zero chemistry (they manage just a bit more in The Snows of Kilimanjaro), and if it weren't for the fantastic scene with King David praying before the Ark of the Covenant, I think this movie would be without many redeeming qualities. However, Peck's passion comes through finally, well enough to convert some nonbelievers in the end. Still, not a Peck showcase, despite the fact that he's the star. He's better with Gardner or Jones."
2,Not to be seen twice,The famed biblical story is told eye-catchingly here with standout cinematography and a pleasant musical score. However the film doesn't really go anywhere and is very monotonous in pace.
4,Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward at their most beautiful,The story line kept on track with the bible and Gregory Pack made a wonderful David. Glossy technicolor reminds you that it was filmed in the 50's and realism wasn't the main objective.A beautiful production however.
2,Too much money for quality,"The picture is already fading and colors coming off. I only washed it by hand with soap and water and the picture now looks crappy. It does protect table, but it should last longer for what it cost."
3,cheap,"product was ok but very cheapGrowers Supply Company Humidity Domes for 4-Inch by 8-Inch by 3-Inch Perma-Nest Plant Trays, Pack of 4"
4,Just okay...,The dome just sits on top of the germination tray (does not snap lock or anything). Nothing special about it.
3,dome only no tray,In my haste to order I assumed product was as pictured. It is dome only. No tray. Seller should state that tray in picture in NOT INCLUDED.
5,"Great software, my 11 YO daughter really enjoys it!","After reading the warnings from previous reviews I bought this for my daughter and once I got it running, she thoroughly enjoyed it. I did have to update the ActiveX controls or DirectX v. 10 on my PC through Microsoft's website and I also had to update the video controller for our NVIDIA GeForce 7300 video card through NVIDIA's website. Once this was done it worked fine - the 3D imaging is nice and the program runs without any delays. My PC needed these updates anyway so be patient if you run into any difficulties during the first attempt at running the program. It's worth it! Also, I found it at BestBuy for $14.99!"
4,Love it!,"My daughter is 6 and we both love this game. We have played it for hours. Barbie has a dream of building her own animal hospital in the country, you but furniture and learn how to treat the animals as Barbie becomes a country vet with her own horse she rides in her free hours. We love it!"
3,not to bad,"I bought this for my 6 yr old daughter and i must say, has wonderful 3D graphis but its a very hard game to learn. She gets frustated with it cause you have to move fast and all. I wouldnt recommend this game for anyone under 10 yrs old"
1,Not what it seems,"My daughter recieved Animal Hospital Pet Vet for Christmas and it has been a huge dissappointment. I have nver submitted a review before but feel very strongly about this statement. The directions are unclear, it is difficult to maneuver around the site, the graphics make her dizzy when trying to zoom in and out and move the 'Vet' thru the clinic. Unfortunately, it has been used already or I would return it. Don't waste your money on this game."
1,boring,This game is so boring! You don't really do anything. And you have to wait ages for the food to arrive. The instruction booklet doesn't come in handy and it's hard to control.
1,doesn't even load,"I purchased this item for one of my son's gifts for Christmas. When I tried to load it, there was a .DLL file missing. I emailed the company but haven't heard back from them. I feel so cheated."
3,This game was okay,"This game was okay. I liked it at first, but the main character is kind of wierd and they don't walk to the front desk quickly enough so my characters run away and tell all their friends. I'd save your money and but somethinng else like Petz 5, which is terrific."
5,Bible of all times absolutely must have!!!!,"I have owned a Lamsa Holy Bible for 15 yrs and it is totally awesome,It is the only bible you must have, being a translation and not a revision has helped me grow in my ministry spiritually, my congregation consisting of ministers in training are all required to read from the Lamsa only. the only thing that I do not like is that it is in paperback being a thick book that it is the pages tear more easily too heavy to carry around when preaching and the fact that living in a Hispanic community a Spanish Bible in hardback would be excellent. An english version in hardback is available but they are old and used, the lettering is small."
3,Ok for a different perspective,"I can admire the work of brother Lamsa but find his translation inconsistent, the translating of Gog/Magog to China/Mongolia clinched it for me and on the shelf it goes."
3,Confusion,"I own Lamsa's Holy Bible & Idiom's books. Mt.27:46, Idioms says""...this was I kept"" with a 4 paragraph explanation, the Bible says""...this I was spared"".Idiom's Mk. 14:22 ""Eat my body"". Bible says ""...this is my body"". Mk.14:24 Idioms says ""Drink my blood"", Bible says ""This is my blood"" I'll write Idioms/Bible. Mk. 16:18 serpents/snake. Mk. 16:20 Amen/""Amen"" not printed. Mk.9:25 Foul spirit/unclean spirit. I just stared reading them and I sure there is more sloppy editing."
3,SO so,"I don't agree with some of his translations, but everyone is entitled to his opinion, including Lamsa. After all, no one knows what the original writers meant or said, and Aramaic is not even the original. It's too bad that translators can't keep from including their own biases."
2,Really? From the most Ancient Text?,"I purchased Holy Bible from the Ancient Eastern Text with the understanding that the translation was from the most ancient text and therefore would be more accurate in interpretation than modern day Bibles. To my great disappointment and utter surprise, I find that this Bible includes passages that were added by later writers and scribes, texts that would definitely not have been found in the earliest of manuscripts. Note examples:Mark 16 is believed to have been added in the 2nd CenturyMatthew 6: 13B was added in the King James version around 1611 AD!Luke 22:43-44 was also most likely added in the 2nd CenturyMr. Lamsa, do you have an explanation?"
5,Aramaic Translation,"This translation is excellent for those people who thought, I didnt equate that verse with the character of God. There are no yes and no scriptures and this translation throws new light on the verses that didnt seem right in the King James. Bless God, Knowledge will indeed increase in these last days."
4,BIBLE STUDY,This is a must read for those wanting a wealth of information about the Old and New Testaments. It brings up as many questions as it provides answers.
3,Not so much,I am not too impressed by this bible but maybe that is just me. Not sure what I was expecting.
5,As Good As It Gets!,"I have read this version and have been very satisfied!The historical context is completely laid out for you, and it is full and well worth the time to study as it will help you immensely to understand the bible's many nuances.Several have referred to the text example:In the King James version, when Christ is crucified, he calls out ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"", which makes it appear that Yeshua/Christ felt abandonded by God in his greatest hour of need.In the Lamsa version, the translation is ""My God, My God, for this I was spared!"", which seems a bit obtuse unless you recall that Yeshua had survived several trials in his life, and when one is spared like that you wonder why and for what purpose. So, it is here that his understanding and purpose is complete!If you are interested in the most correct possible translation of the Bible, and are ready for the real clarity it will bring, then this is it."
3,My kissing inefficiency,"I enjoyed the novels candid look at the simple act of kissing. Society seems to overlokk kissing and just hop into bed first.The problem that I had with this book, is that instead of a new kiss everyday for 365 days, I used all the kisses in one day. I hope this is the abridged version, because I need some more ideas."
5,Slick Case,"This review is being written on day one, so I can't speak to the case's resilience, but in all other respects it is slick. It manages to protect the 30GB Zen very well without sacrificing compact size. Closed, it still fits firmly in the palm, and the belt hook is unobtrusive, as well. The leather is soft and supple, and does not feel cheap. The seams look well-sewn. The front flap is nicely rigid, and the double-sided snap is simple and strong. The Zen's buttons push with ease through the case; in fact I would guess the mechanism will last longer thanks to the case's added thickness--less direct pressure. The clear plastic screen may be the case's weak point as it appears readily scratchable and somewhat flimsy, but I am in no way disappointed. The case does what it says, looks stylish, feels classy, and ameliorates the fear of dropping your MP3 player. And on sale for about $13 shipped...who can complain?"
2,More fiction then informative,"Having read the reviews I expected the book to be more instructional. Frankly, having read the reviews I was hoping the book would delve into the psychological aspects of female domination in the marriage. I was disappointed to find that it was little more than a story of a couple who invited their neighbor to share a spanking/paddling/caning session with them. If you are looking for erotic literature of this type, this is for you. If you are looking for studies, information and instruction on this type of lifestyle, keep looking."
4,The greatest movie of all time!~,"This movie shows the epic that was General George S. Patton Jr. He was more then a man, he was a leader of unparralled proportions and could have won the war 2 full years earlier if he had been given free reign!@ Patton should have been Supreme Commander!"
5,All time great movie.,I'd lost my old copy & bought this to replace it. So very pleased. Like watching it for the first time all over again.
5,amazing!,This was one of my favorite purchases off of Amazon!!! ^.^ Thank you so much! i also got it alot quicker then i thought i would of!
5,It never gets old,I Grandfather loved this movie. I loved this movie. The package was like brand new. If your world war history buff you would like this movie.
2,Patton Collector's Edition: Great Movie - Defective Product,"The movie is an all-time great. Disc 2 has many interesting special features. However, Disc 1, the movie itself, was defective. It stuck and skipped constantly. The problem was the disc, not my player."
1,Information not accurate,"I bought this Bluray because of the included spanish subtitles. The only subs inside are english, mandarin, cantonese and cc english. It includes spanish dub in mono. I think Amazon has to review its lebeling technics. I gave it only 1 star, because of that, otherwhise, 5 stars"
5,One of the greatest war films of all time. A masterpiece!,"George C. Scott's defining role. He was born to play Patton. You couldn't seperate the Patton out of future roles he played. An excellenct script tells well the tale of the battle, not only between the Allies and the Nazis, but between Patton and Montgomery- a rivalry that history has said cost many allied lives in these egotistical generals quest for glory. The battle scenes were ahead of their time, though (sorry ""Private Ryan"" fans) not as gory as modern make-up and editing can make them. So many great lines uttered throughout this flick. But the best line related to this movie came not in the movie, but at the Academy Awards when Scott in denying his award for best actor submitted a message explaining, he couldn't accept an award that compared his performance to other actors'. How true."
5,Patton the legend,"I am not usually a very big fan of old movies due to the quality of the filming, sound, etc; however In This movie you will see Patton, the man & his achievements. An excellent description of his character, his tactics and his attitude with his men. A very strong character well worthy of his legend. A great history movie full of action which age very well with years; and unlike other old movies, the photography as well as the DVD sound and picture are very good. A great DVD to own. Highly recommended."
5,EVEN IF YOUR NOT A PATTON FAN - SEE THIS ONE ANYWAY,"Even though you may not be a particular fan of George Patton, many are not, i.e. Andy Rooney, the little dweeb, see this one anyway. George C. Scott in his role as Patton, gives us one of the best performances in recent history. The movie is worth watching his work if for no other reason. Other than that, yes, the movie is quite well done. The DVD edition may indeed have been slightly cut here and there but this in no way distracts from Scott's performance nor does it take anything away from the story. I have viewed both the original and the DVD and there is little difference. This has become a true classic and I highly recommend."
5,Classic epic war film,"George C. Scott's finest performance as the larger-than-life General Patton. Apart from Patton's military career, this film tries to uncover who the man really was. The genius of modern warfare? A romantic warrior from another time? Or perhaps a crackpot? Perhaps Patton was all of these and more.Even in the massive scope of WWII this film keeps Patton firmly at the center. Regardless of his historical contributions to the war effort, we see him as the stuff of legend -- the kind of epic hero about whom poets like Homer used to sing.As we follow his breathtaking career from the North Africa campaign to the end of the war, we see how Patton's ongoing collisions with the Nazis rivaled those against his own soldiers and superiors.Here was a man who only found purpose in warfare and who almost failed to appreciate it's painful, human element.In the end, Patton triumphs, only to acknowledge that he is just playing a part in a historical drama."
5,Strong testament to a General and a generation of Americans,"This movie is not too caustic for kids to see. War is hell and Patton was the leader to get us through it. Kids hear much worse language with much less of a message. Patton shows a complex man driven by echos of fargone battles; his spirit is truly American, at once charming and bitter, humorous and insidious. You'll love the movie and the man after seeing this film. The cinematography and soundtrack do justice to the grand conquest to save Western Civilization. To quote the General: ""God help me I love it""."
2,B.A.D.,George Scott is a good actor but did not portray Patton very well except in the profanity that Patton used. I just feel that this movie did not capture enough of Patton's life. They should have went through the years of his life step by step. How did this thing ever win eight academy awards and win best picture for 1970. One thing that was really dumb was that they showed the germans talking about Patton and that's all the germans do. there was barely any war action it was a total waste of film. I bought it because of what it said on the front cover- eight academy awards and best picture 1970. What a joke. One special feature that was put on here was an audio essay. That was pretty interesting. This movie also comes in 5.1 sourround sound and that's a good deal for a movie from 1970. Please do not waste your money and buy this piece of junk in less you really really do like war movies. God bless oyu and have a great day.
2,What a jerk!,"I can see why this movie made it to the top 100 list. I can also see why it was only 89 on that list. This movie glorifies General Patton as a war hero, which indeed he is, but he is also a selfish, conceded, unforgiving jerk! He doesn't give a second thought about hitting a frightened soldier across the face. And what is so cowardly about the fear of death? And Patton just doesn't learn. He is the same man at the end of the film as he was in the beginning. An extra star for some fine acting on George's part."
3,"Very long, get boring as it drags on.","Generally I like war movies, but not this one.The good:Acting is top notch.Cinematography is flawless.Blu-ray is great.Sound is awesome.The bad:The beginning half is good but this movie is too long for me.I fell asleep two hours into the movies, yes this movie is looong.The only other movies I have fallen asleep are Harry Potter movies, and I like long movies such as Lord of the Ring extended editions.Overall: great movie if you can stand the length and the boring plot, I can't."
5,Patton should have his own national holiday!,"The speech in front of the flag brings tears to my eyes every time I see it. Patton knew what it meant to be an American when the chips were down. MacArthur, Patton, Nimitz, Reagan. The 21st century couldn't possibly have men like those."
5,"""...It's only important for me to know.""","This movie only gets better with age and, apparently, with re-mastering. What a beautifully done film. Everything from George C. Scott's portray of an extremely complex man, to the soundtrack, and epic scenery contribute to one of the most complete film's of the last forty years. Add Karl Malden's equally superlative performance as Omar Bradley and what you have is one of the most complete and evocative biographical sketches ever to grace celulloid."
4,Pure genious,Great movie all around. Patton was a hard driving son of a b1tch .. but he was right. His belief was to quickly end the battle by overwhelming his enemy. This is portrayed in the movie as he drives his men hard.
5,patton,As on old military man I was impressed with the film PATTON. I enjoyed the in depth look at general patton. A guy who got the job done.....
5,The Great One,"George C. Scott gives a towering performance as George Patton. It is an immensely popular film that idealizes the man who many consider the best American general oF World War II. Has any American not seen, and enjoyed, this movie?"
4,It needs a lot to be a hero,"Though this may seem like just another movie based on the second world war, the movie is engrossing and never leaves an impression on the vievers mind that this is just another war movie, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend to others to watch as well."
2,blu-ray features are bad :-(,"Biography of U.S. General George S. Patton, who, after beating German Marshal Rommel in North Africa, led his troops in an unstoppable throughout Europe. Unfortunately blu-ray features are bad, said to include subtitles in Spanish, not included, only brings audio in Spanish, so if you want to see the original version with subtitles in Spanish, sorry, will be disappointed.best regards"
3,I want the whole movie,"Patton is a great movie. The VHS and DVD copies do not have the entire movie however. I have a copy of the entire movie that I taped off of TV. On the DVD and VHS versions, the movie ends with Patton walking his dog towards the windmill. They are cutting off about 30 minutes of the movie in these versions. You are missing the following:1. Patton rebuilding Germany2. A birthday celebration with his wife3. Patton sword fighting4. How Patton treated captured Germans5. The car accidentWhen I bought the DVD, I assumed that it had the entire movie as it is a 2 DVD set. I was dismayed to find that the second DVD had some garbage about the musical score."
3,Great Movie (Wish It Was More Accurate),Great movie but Hollywood needs to be more accurate instead of altering the facts or removing them. Shame on Hollywood.
3,Quality,"Picture and sound quality were amazing. I loved the sound because the macrodynamics were right on - in other words, the explosions were really loud, and the dialog was not. This is how things sound in real life - none of this crap you see nowadays where the actors are passionately whispering to each other in the middle of a battle.The movie sure did move along slowly, though. I thought it was a little boring."
5,Classic Telling of a true event!,"This is by far one of the best movies made. Along with ""The Last Days Of Patton"" they make a great gift and also an educational item. If you never have seen this movie, you're missing a great story."
5,Entire movie on DVD,"My DVD copy of Patton has the entire movie including him walking Willy toward the windmill. Not sure why the previous reviewer's copy was short. Anyway, this is one of my all time favorite movies. It is the best portrayal of a person that I've ever seen in any movie. If you like military movies, you won't be dissapointed in Patton."
5,PORTRAIT OF A GENERAL AT WAR,"One of the few great movie biographies. As long as this film is, there is not a let down moment. It's a marvellous character analysis of a man who lived for the war. Many priceless scenes with GEORGES C.SCOTT giving the best performance of his career. Among the highlights:PATTON and MONTGOMERY battling for their personnal ego;the general giving a slap to a war wounded and paying the price for his misconduct;his incredible knowledge about the history of wars;his incapacity to deal with the authority of his superiors etc.A truely fascinating study of a remarkable man who had guts."
5,5 stars for the 4 star general!,"I just bought this from Amazon.Com on DVD and all I can say is ""WOW!"" Whatta documentary! George C. Scott steals the show!The ""Purple Heart scene"" was one of the best, along with the ""donkeys on the bridge scene"" and the ""Chapel scene"".NOTE: My great-uncle Will Lang Jr.(a Time/Life reporter) followed the campaign of Patton and was also a friend of the famous political cartoonist Bill Maudlin"
5,Patton on DVD is a must have!,"Patton on DVD is a classic and should be owned by any WWII movie buff. The only complaint I can think of is that sometime the dialog seems to be a bit on the soft side, maybe I just had the volume too low. But other than that this is a great classice that everyonew with a DVD player should own."
1,I prefer the dvd or vhs... the Blue-ray version has been butchered,"The movie is extraordinary. I hate the Blue-ray version of the movie! Save your money... vhs or dvd better represent the original. The Blue-ray version has been butchered! Black and white movies colorized is off my list also... And would someone please tell me how to start the movie without the previews and introductions? I have no interest in the opinions of others about the movie prior to watching the movie. And forcing me to watch previews of other movies are best left to copies from Blockbuster or the theater. $2000 for a new tv, new cable box, new receiver, new Blue-ray player and it sucks! And $20+ for the Blue-ray. Fox should pay me to watch the previews. The DVD version stays and the new Blue-ray version is to be listed on eBay later tonight."
5,Patton DVD,My tape of Patton finally couldn't cut it anymore. It just wore out. I bought the DVD and the picture on my new high def TV was great. I've seen the movie dozens of times and this is the best since the original on the movie screen. The companion DVD reviewing the original shooting of the film is great also. This is a very good package.
5,A must for the collection,"I like this movie as it tells a true period of this mans life.George C Scott did a terrific portrail of one of histories,our great country,Generals. Glad to have it!"
5,Educational viewing,"Iv'e seen this movie many times and have enjoyed it every time, never get tired of it. I purchased this one for my Grandson who was reading the book called Patton for a book report at school. He said he had a hard time understanding some of the events in the book, so I wanted him to see the movie to help him with his book report."
2,patton,a very good war film one of the best. I purchased this film after patton 2 disc and found out that it is not 2.35 aspect ratio but 2.20. After I purchased this version 2.35 aspect ratio to find out that the 2 disc is the letterbox original version that is the 2.20 widscreen.
5,5 stars even though ...,"...it is a little uneven in spots. It is an ambitious movie made on a grand scale, and that is always a tall order. Setting aside the fact, that this is not a ""Ben Hur"" for instance, it is still a winner."
4,God Help Me I Love It,"George C. Scott is really good, but here's the simple secret to PATTON's greatness: the writer.The screenplay, including that thundering monologue at the open and all the dreamy stuff about ancient Rome and the Carthaginians, was written by Francis Ford Coppola, the genius behind THE GODFATHER, APOCOLYPSE NOW, and others."
2,This DVD is a cut version of the film.,"I saw this film in the 1970's and this DVD edition, although it does not state that it is cut, has cut out the scene where Patton meets someone while he is on the toilet. The language also has probably been edited (euphamisms for the F word) which I am fairly sure were in the original.I am extremely diappointed in the manufacturer for doing something like this to the film without informing it's audience and buyers...seems like faud to me.The original movie was great, a cut version is by definition less so."
5,One of the best that my money can get in terms of biography movies.,"George Scott`s acting is superb. It`s so convincing that it glued me to the chair from the beginning till the end. It touches me deeply because Patton was revealed as a human being with both strength and weaknesses. From what I learnt from history books, the movie contains many facts too.This is one of the few movies that leaves a long lasting impression on me. No wonder, it won 7 Oscars in 1970 including the best picture.In short, it`s one the best that my money can get in terms of biography movies."
1,Bad DVD !!!,"I got two patton DVD a while back, it's the same picture as on this DVD. I gave one to a buddy, and both DVD's were bad about half way into the movie. I want to buy another one, but dont want to get my hopes up and be let down again. IM in Iraq and it takes a week or so to get a DVD. Patton was a true hero !!! Chestie Puller was also a true hero !!! I wish I could find a movie about him."
3,Any resemblance to WW2 is coincidental.,"""Patton"" although fun to watch because of his portrayal by George C. Scott just does not have the look or feel on World War 2. First I will mention something about Scott's portrayal of Patton; he is too fat and his voice too deep for the real Patton. If someone ever has the opportunity to listen to a recording of George S. Patton's voice you'll be struck about how effeminate it sounds. Of course Scott's waste line also does no justice to the tall and trim Patton but that can be overlooked. What is hard to overlook is that the film looks too much like the Spanish army on maneuvers than a World War II battle.Then there are the numerous historical inaccuracies in the film. The most notable one is where Patton greets Montgomery in Messina. Didn't happen! Well I could go on. For accuracy I would place ""Tora, Tora , Tora"" above Patton. For fun I'd chose ""Patton."" But do not use this film as a source for a Master's Thesis."
1,"This is described as ""Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1"" and Not Widescreen","I hope everybody noticed in the product details that this has a ""Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1"" So I hope you don't think just because it's a ""Blu-Ray"" that it would be Wide screen."
4,"Transfer is good, but spooky-smooth","If you expect this movie to have a film look to it, you will be disappointed. It's spooky the way it looks like it was shot last year with HD video cameras instead of 40 years ago in glorious 70mm.The aspect ratio is correct at 2.2:1, the colors look good, if a bit more vibrant than I expected (I may have to check the mode on my LG TV, which sometimes forgets to use my calibrated settings.)Judging by the occasional spot that flickers by, not alot of hand effort went into this master, and I would still prefer to see a better effort.At $10 on a gold box deal, it's totally worth it given that the better remastering that was talked about early last year still hasn't appeared."
4,Smashing!,Patton is and always one of my favorite George C Scott movies. The DVD conversion made it look like it was made yesterday. Can't say more. A great production.
3,"5 STAR MOVIE, 3 STAR DVD IMAGE",Both Patton and the The Longest Day are 5 star movies with good extras but when i compared them to the old versions i was very disappointed with the image. The new dvd on Patton has a less sharp picture and kinda of blurry and the colors are too red. The Longest Day also has a less than sharp picture and is too dark compared to the old one but it will fit your widesceen tv.Good extras but could have done better with the image so i will keep both the old and new release.
2,not healthy salt stick,ok well if you do your research on google it says that salt sticks are not good for guinea pigs its not healthy but i guess the rack is good i dont think its worth your money because there are better hay racks on amazon.com dont waste your monkey on this one
5,Loved it,Keeps his cage looking clean. I had to slightly modify mine as well. (Read on some other reviews that it may come a little warped.) Probably the best thing I bought for Tribbs.
1,poor design,"The description says it has a ""locking lid"", but you have to have the lid locked in place just to keep the body of the feeder open like it's supposed to be. The walls should be able to snap into place and stay there while you open the lid to replenish the hay. But what happens is that once you wrangle the top open, the panels collapse and you are forced to cram the hay into a non-rigid assembly, and then somehow get the top to ""lock"" back up. This is WAY too much effort to expend a couple of times per day, and the irritation it caused was just not worth it."
3,small feeder,"This hay feeder is very small to insert the feed. The guinea pigs knock it off the cage daily. Although it does work, I would choose a different feeder in the future."
3,Too complicated,"Nice little hay feeder, but has too many bells and whistles (if this is possible!). Attaches ok to the side of the cage (it just hangs, it's not secured in any way) and the top of the feeder looks like it should attach or hook on to something but I sure can't figure it out!"
5,"A ""must-read"" for any teenager.","A gripping tale of survival; a man and his children who saved each other. It is clear that this father holds his children in high esteem as he describes the pain and starvation that his family had to endure. The children are remarkably adept, quickly learning and applying survival techniques. For instance, the oldest daughter, by sheer will and determination, lifted her father up a cliff to avoid being swept away by the strong waves. These children worked together to overcome hypothermia, starvation and infection from wounds and frostbite. It is a book that makes you reflect on your own situation and leads you to ask the question, 'Would I be able to survive under those circumstances?'"
3,"Good, but not her best.","This is a story of a Japanese woman and her life story. It is an OK book, but I can honestly say that some of her others are better. Easy enough to read, but save it for later."
5,Excellent and Very Well Researched,She has done it again. Her books shows the hardships of one young girl and the Honor she tries to maintain. I would recommend this book to everyone. The book gives a side of WWII that wasn't covered very good in the high school history classes. If you liked this book you should read MALICE or THE GIFT.
3,"Good, but unrealistic.","I enjoyed reading this book for the historical lesson -- I was deeply saddened by the treatment of the Japanese in America. BUT, I was a little put-off by the way the characthers ""changed their skin"" so drastically after coming to America. I find it hard to believe that a young Japanese girl raised in Japan would fall in love with and get pregnant by an American. I feel that the whole family shed its morals and values much too easily and quickly. I have always thought that these are things that are instilled in a person and that environment cAN not take them away. Perhaps the American-born Japanese children would behave in the way depicted, but Hiroko should have clung to her values."
2,"Nice try, BUT NEEDS MORE!","The author is trying to write something different from her other books, but fails to truely understand the background. D.Steel describes the war camp, how families and lovers suffer during the war very well, but as for the Japanese culture, family values, I'm afraid she needs to understand and study more than that."
3,Interesting and informative...but a little stereotypical,"I liked this book. I think there shuld be more books written about this subject. It is painfully overlooked. Being of Japanese decent, I have many relatives who survived just the kind of experiences mentioned in this book. I think the parts about the camps are very realistic and spectacularly written, but I shake my head at the boy/girl relationship this book is based on. I really don't think a sturdy, well-bread girl like Hiroko would just jump into a relationship so fast, much less with a white man. It gose against everything she was raised to believe. I think this book gives a very stereotypical view of the Japanese women and their morals. Steele really tried, but I think more study into traditional Japanese culture is necessary."
5,"Super great story, easy to read. You'll miss the characters when your done with the book!","I love how Danielle Steel often incorporates history into her stories. I didn't know much about the relocation of the American Japanese but I do now. This is an easy read, as all DS books are."
1,"oh, my, this is just awful","I received this as a gift for my daughter. It is beyond awful. Just listen to the sample songs -- just hideous! I think it is supposed to be children singing, but I can't imagine children sounding so atrocious! This is absolutely ghastly. I cannot imagine anyone enjoying this c.d."
4,This is a great book for beginners,I got this book when I first started thiss hobby. It has really helped me learn more. It has common names on every fish that has a common name. I found a few errors (e.g. the scientific name of the clown pleco is wrong). It also has a great index. Before it states the fish by class it gives you the basics of setting up an aquarium. Though I would not reccomend it as a guide for physically setting up the aquarium. It is more of an encyclopedia. Its worth the money.Jon
2,just okay,This dvd was fun. It is a late 50's viewing of both shows.According to the inside paperwork...this real price was from a dollar bin. Of course you'd have to find it to pay that price.I am glad I got to see it...but I'd check for the air date next time.
3,Not bad,"VERY boring, except for the last two tracks not listed on the cover. They're very good and show what Mato can do. I wish I could find an entire DVD that shows off what the Experience Hendrix DVD showed of him, though."
3,I'd really like the high-end version....,"I bought this exclusively for use with champagne; i.e., the pressure function rather than the vacuum function. I use it all the time, and it does do the job, but I'd gladly pay three times as much for a better-constructed version, perhaps of metal rather than plastic, and with valves that really work. Don't know if I got a lemon, but the one-way valve is so slow to kick in that I have to lift the whole pump off the bottle on every upstroke, so that it can suck in air efficiently. Also, the rubber O-ring is a poor press fit and constantly pops out. Net: A good idea, but not particularly well executed."
1,Doesn't work well -- A waste of money,"I ordered this product as well as a set of extra Swissmar stoppers -- it was one of those things that sounds good, but turns out to be more trouble than it's worth, and never lives up to the promise. There's no way to tell for sure if you have a vacuum, unless you bend the release pin on the stopper, but then of course if you had a vacuum, you just released it. And if you do get a good seal, it slowly releases over time.But here's the biggest warning: if you're planning on storing wine bottles or other beverages on their side (like in a wine rack), they will leak thru the stopper. I've tried this a number of times (I store bottles on their side in the fridge), being careful to pump the best vacuum I can, and everytime, they leak, leaving a small puddle of wine below the stopper. If you plan to store bottles like this, don't waste your money. Do a search for ""leak-proof"" wine stoppers. You'll find better products."
2,Swissmar Epivac not that great,Godd advertising and the product is almost good. The first time I tried to use it 2 folks at the gathering said they each had wished they knew I wanted one of these because they each had one at home that also was not that useful.
2,Wasted my money.,I bought this for a birthday gift for my husband. He's getting into wines. Well we were very disappointed. You need to pump forever and the seal does not hold. Don't waste your money. If you want the air taken out either drink all the wine or use a vacuum sealer.
1,"Swissmar Epivac Wine & Champagne Saver Set, Chrome",Pump shipped to me did not work. I had to get a replacement from the manufacture. It took several hours of effort to find manufacture's phone number and another week to get replacement pump.
3,Good but could have been better.,"I bought this blu-ray title an addition to my collection of the biblical epics of the fifties thru the mid 60's, such as The Robe, King of Kings, Quo Vadis etc. I first saw this movie when it premiered in NY city and was somewhat disappointed in it. It's a mixed bag of good, interesting and sincere. I think George C. Scott as Abraham is probably the best thing about the film. I also found the music by composer Toshiro Mifume to be very bland and mundane. Definetly not as uplifting a musical score by likes of Miklos Rozsa or Alfred Newman.Upon viewing the blu-ray disc, I again found the transfer to be good not great. A future restoration would be better to wait for, unless you are an avid movie collector like me. If so, add this one to your collection."
4,The Bible,excelent movie gives a great overvier of the bible and is a great help for people to learn more about it.
3,My Review,"Ok, i have seen this movie twice and it annoys me when film makers or directors do not seem to spend time on research. Although it ran (as well as it could) along the events of Genisis i'm afraid the charcters or the mood is not as alive as it is in the scriptures. Hey you film makers the scriptures has a living message throughout it's pages, do you think you can make your movies as alive and living as the 'Word Of God'?.Come on guys the Bible is older than us all and it has brought inspiration to millions throughout the centuries to both great and small, rich and poor, selfish and humble.....Thats just my opinion."
1,Why!?,I don't know why the damn volume has to be so low on these videos. Putting on my headphones every time just to watch a video is getting to be extremely annoying!
1,The Bible according to Dino De Laurentiis,"Read the book! Nice cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno, but, read the book! The only good scene is when Stephen Boyd confronts the Tower of Babble. This is the type of film that put good actors like Stephen Boyd, rest his soul, out of work. By the way, I must say that Stephen had nice eye shadow. That is a sad testament for a team of good filmmakers."
4,In The Beginning...,"This is an old movie. No, it is not perfect, but it is one of the better ones. A must have for your home Bible movie collection."
2,Presentation Could Be Better,"John Huston's filmization of the first few chapters of the Book of Genesis is good, though not as fine as it certainly could have been, given the material to work with. Much of the second half of the film is rather boring, with a great deal of monotonous conversation between the characters. The first half of the movie is much better, with Huston's humorous characterization of Noah a highlight.Most upsetting of all is the DVD presentation. The box indicates the film is presented in a 2.55:1 ratio, which is a super widescreen image. Instead, the film is shown in what looks like 2.20:1. Interestingly, the widescreen VHS tape presents the film in 2.35:1. Therefore, for some reason, we are being robbed of part of the film image. Why? The film gets 3 stars, but I take one away because of the botched presentation."
3,"Worth watching, but flawed","This was indeed a monumental project, but not perfectly handled. Of course, John Huston was an atheist, and this needs to be taken into consideration. He did soften parts of this to portray more typically human reactions, especially with the scenes between Abraham and his son Isaac, than the Bible portrays.The portrayal of God seems accurate enough. But to portray the devoutness of the human characters would take a more devout director. The result is a lack of conviction in some scenes.This lack of conviction therefore will disturb many drawn to the movie who will see that this isn't truly filmed as a portrayal of actual history. It comes across more as a dramatization of myth, and the viewer's reaction therefore will depend on that viewer's perspective.As spectacle, it avoids the DeMille type excess. As acting, Huston himself does take the spotlight with his portrayal of Noah.Seen without great expectations, one will find it suitably reverant and still entertaining."
5,Loved It,The DVD is so great for watching each story in chapters. I still remember sitting through 3 and a half hours the first time I saw it. I'm ready for the sequel.
4,it is ok,"It is ok, I expected more, but it is okay, Sometimes expectations are not good but the dvd shows what it says it will, short version of it."
3,The Beginning,"This is a Genesis movie that was made in the 1960's and because of this moves in the 60's movie way, it is slow for the modern audience. The dialogue seems to be half pulled from the Bible and half written for a modern audience. But that can be somewhat forgiven.It does show Creation, Adam and Eve and the Flood. The Noah's Ark portion was my favourite, mostly because I like animals, but also because it shows the point of the story very well. I thought this was the best part of the film altogether.The film ends with the story of Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac, which I felt was pretty well done. The part of the Abraham story I didn't like was the portrayal of Ishmael as some evil sort of child corrupted by his mother. That seemed really unnecessary.But, being from the 60's, it's a family friendly movie."
3,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 23","Wow! John Huston as Noah, George C. Scott as Abraham, Ava Gardner as Sara and God as God. I liked the second chapter with Huston as a facetious Noah and the Babel tower episode. Now, it's a Dino De Laurentiis production and Huston didn't have much latitude with a book like the Bible so don't expect too much in terms of surprises. Recommended."
3,Frustrating.,"Hello everyone. Why do all Biblical movies depict the Patriarchs as simple, dirty shepards? Abram was son of the high priest of Ur. Not a shepard! A refined Kingly man. A good purchase if you want to support the Bible movie industry. Why has it been so difficult to film an accurate, non melodramatic Bible film?"
4,noah ark,remembered watching when i was little and found it to be just as entertaining/informative again. seller was great. delivery service fast
5,Impressive Restoration to a Classic Tale!,The Bible has been a great staple of my family for years and they did a really good job putting it on Blu ray. I highly recommend it in your collection right next to The 10 Commandments and Ben Hur.
3,Interesting,"I like Noah's story the best. The Creation story was on the slow side and garden wasn't as vibrant as I would envision Eden to be....because Adam and Eve were naked, the actors were mostly shown in dark shadows. Abraham looked real phoney in his hair and make up...as did King Nimrod. Very 60's and funny that Noah spoke in old English found in the KJV bible. An interesting dipiction of Genesis but not the greatest."
5,excellent quality,The PQ is superb. The audio is okay but good compared to other 1960's films. The movie is long and has good parts and boring parts. But the flood is best with Noah. I do not know how they got the animals to get along! I wish they would have included King David. A Classic Blu Ray Disc.
2,"Dull, Dark, and Dank","The Book is definitely better than the movie. The motion picture is a ponderous, sometimes goofy, piece of garbage that tends to trivialize the Biblical story. For example, King Nimrod's eye liner is really too much. The lighting is very uneven. The picture practically goes black in spots. Save your money and read the Bible instead. You will get more out of it."
4,a valid epic minus the silly serpent in the tree,"Sit back and enjoy the artistic vision of the commencement of judeo-christian culture. i like my Bible and history movies to be as accurate as possible and this one did okay. the serpent in the tree was portrayed by an ominous man hidden in the shadows of the branches which was silly. all of the ""bad"" characters use lots of dark make-up and jewelry made of bones in order to villify themselves. it's slow, but grand. One wishes it could go on and tell the story of jacob and joseph and moses and joshua, but i guess a movie about the whole bible might be a bit of work."
2,"save your $, read the book","one of the last of the biblical epics, this was a bomb in its initial release, and deservedly so. the movie doesnt know whether it is de mille or italian realism, and most of the sequences (adam & eve, tower of babel) are either laughable or langorous (george c scott & ava gardner as abraham & sarah). yet stuck in the middle is a fine half hour sequence of the story of noah, with director john huston casting himself in the one strong sequence in the movie: replete with the right mix of humor and awe. that half hour isnt enough to recommend buying or renting the dvd, but if you can catch it on tv some day, its worth a half hour of your life."
2,"In a word, boring","From a scriptural standpoint, it isn't too bad. But the production is rather poor, as others in the reviews mentioned. The use of color in the film makes the scenes feel dull. And the acting is rather average.I think this would be a good movie for young children, though. They aren't as critical as we adults and they will probably get more out of it."
3,Exhausting,"Mr. Rorem's prose is difficult to read. It is a chaotic collection ranging from the useless to the quite informative, from the truly insightful to the really horribly boring. Indeed such a collection falls under the definition of a ""private"" diary; however, more literary skill is needed when a book is offered to the broad public. Not that it is a complete waste of time - a student of NYC cultural life can find the book fascinating. In fact, Mr. Rorem's writing is so self-centered that nothing in this book really has any true existence except for NYC, the Nantucket home, and possibly Paris from decades ago. That a person with such intellect and talent can be so limited in his perception of the world is beyond my understanding.I think Mr. Rorem's music is far better than his limping prose."
4,Unique approach,"I picked up this book from an occult shop as a sort of curio around 2000, and only got a chance to read it this weekend. While clearly self-published, the information is valuable, and the authors make some effort to answer to scientific concerns, albeit the response is ""you probably won't like this.""I'm wishing that this came out at a time when online networking was common, as I can see this type of work being invaluable. It doesn't matter if the entities are just extensions of the unconscious mind or literal beings - if this form of visualization and release genuinely helps people and can be done without invasive surgery or chemical alteration, it's well worth exploring. I only wish I knew how to begin to ask to find people who practice this now."
4,Wonderful story book!,"I found a copy of this at a library sale. My 5-year-old daughter loves it! It contains some traditional fairy tales like Rapunzel and Cinderella, but the real treasures are the many original stories that we haven't come across in any other book. A delightful collection!"
2,Bad Compilation,"Beautiful hardback binding and pictures. Stories that are nonsensical, that contain words too difficult for young children and storylines that are too juvenile for older children."
4,JUST THOUGHT YOU LIKE TO KNOW!,"After listening to this CD for only a few seconds I not only found it quality in sound, but I also found it containing good songs that can bring you back memories.And last but not least, all tracks are in deed ORIGINAL HITS and ORIGINAL ARTISTS.Just thought you like to know!"
2,Great Video Terrible Audio,The video portion of this blu-ray edition was gorgeous but the audio made it almost unwatchable. The music and musical numbers were much louder than the dialogue.
5,time warp wow!,i ordered this in time for halloween and the delivery was speedy! i remembering watching this movie live in college and loving it...and this dvd delivered the same! i especially love the special features of crowd behavior and talk back! love it and would recommend to strange movie buffs everywhere!
3,Rocky Horror Picture Show,"Once we got to play this movie..it was awesome. But little did we realize, it was from UK when purchased through Amazon. Much to our surprise! We had to literally buy a new DVD player to watch this. Different country codes for foreign movies and our old player was not compatible. Buyer beware!"
4,Rocky Horror Picture Show,"This movie, for it's time, broke all the rules for what should be done in movies. People so enjoyed this alternative story line that it spawned the cult following that it enjoyed in the 1970s and even today. Have no preconceptions, just watch and ask yourself, ""Have I seen anything quite like this before?"""
3,"Love it or hate it,it's unique","O.k.the plot is thin.O.k.,punk is outdated.O.k,the ending's a bit cryptic,if not absurd.But the music go to your heart (the Time Warp Song,Sweet Tranvestite,Eddie's songs),Tim Curry is pure camp,the mix of parody and tragedy perfect.Oh,and I just love that crreepy Riff Raff,that scmuckiest of schmucks Brad ,and poor naive Janet.RHPS does FEEL great!"
1,The mind boggles!,"I really don't know why this abismal garbage has the following that it does! OK, so there are a couple of ""songs"" that peole have heard somewhere, but the rest of it sounds like the same thing over and over. I think a ten year old could have written the musival score and as for the lyrics....well, I won't even bother! I know that people won't appreciate what I've written here, but really! This is an insult to your intelligence! Someone is passing off this rubbish as legitimate entertainment. Go ahead and buy it, suckers!"
1,I would give it O stars if I could !,"I heard that this was the most watched cult movie of all time so I rented it. I was in agony through the whole movie, IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! The plot is bad and the music is even worse! The charectors are so anoying its not even funny. I had to restrain myself from turning it off! I have thought most cult movies have been funny but this one is just BAD!!"
1,And???,"If it's a horror movie it's not scary. If it's a comedy it's not funny. What's the point? OK, OK, maybe it did have it's 15 minutes of fame back in the days when people were easily impressed by sleazy jokes and crossdressed people but now it all seems unoriginal, vulgar and dull. Don't expect much of anything if you haven't seen this before. If you are really into it, it's time for you to wake up and smell the coffee: this is down and out!"
1,Frankenfurter has epilepsy,Copletely skips all over the place... NOT reccomended.I don't know what monkeys put this thing together butit fellates. My VHS copy is much smoother. This thingglitches numerous times apparently losing track ofwhere it is on the disc. Too bad there is no 0 star rating.
1,BORING AS HELL,"Right down there with EASY RIDER as one of the most vastly over-rated films of all time. Some older people I know say it's meant to be a ""theater experience"", but I've never seen it in a theater. First off, the sound is horrible. Second, the filming is blurry. Thirdly, it makes no sense at all. The music is so childish, (""DAMN IT JANET""), it makes you sick. Not a good watch. Pitiful."
4,"_Not_ the greatest film of all time, but...","No, this is _not_ the ""best movie ever made,"" but it _is_ as bizarre and depraved as you've heard.The film has a... Unique style, and songs that are actually _good_ (understand, I usually detest musicals). The acting is much better than you'd expect, and the story's relatively deep. All in all, an incredibly fun film that's worth more than a few viewings. None of the characters is really endearing, but you can't help but love 'em (how could they do that to Columbia? [sniff!])The Special Edition adds two musical numbers: Once in a While, and Superheroes. Superheroes is in the theatrical version, but Once in a While is (thankfully) only available here. The songs are tacked on to the end of the film, not inserted in their places."
4,dvd,5 copies of this movie are Christmass gifts. I have not seen any of them. I received 3 in the original purchase and had to ask for 2 more to complete the purchase. 2 more arrived quickly but I don't dnot about the quality as they're gifts to be given.
5,Rocky Horror,Got my DVD in a timely fashion. It was received as advertised and in good working order. Thank you
5,Great version,"Original cast (Richard O'Brien, Barry Bostwick, Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry) soundtrack of the theatrical version made famous in Midnight Movie show houses across America in the 70's and 80's. This is an extremely rare example of a movie being better than stage. Richard O'Brien and Jim Sharman did a great job making the converting the play to film!"
2,No sound,I never was able to get sound through my roku box. I did manage to watch most of the movie by connecting my computer to my television. Of course I could not watch it in HD.
2,Let's do the Time Warp again.,"Aside from the ""Time Warp"" sequence, I've always thought this movie was just uninteresting. It has a few good moments but... I just bought it so I could have a copy of ""The Time Warp."""
5,Great Movie!,I love this movie. It's spooky and funny and I love the costumes and all the fun makeup. You should buy this tape and watch it over and over.
5,Time Warp again,"Wow, Rocky Horror Picture Show....what can you say about it? Either you love it or you hate it. Personally, I love it for all its campiness. It plays like a wild frat party filtered through Andy Warhol. Not that this is a bad thing. But, you need to like weird, because this show just is not normal. The songs are very addictive. You will be singing Time Warp and Toucha Toucha Toucha Me long after the credits stop rolling. Sit back, enjoy and laugh. And if you feel like shouting comments at the screen like at the midnight showings, rock on."
4,"""Don't dream it, Be it""","I first heard of Rocky Horror Picture Show (RHPS), back in the early 1980's when I saw a glimpse of it in the movie FAME, and wondered where you saw it. I first went to see RHPS back in 1986, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where I immediately fell in love with the movie, and in 1998 I joined the ""Floor Show"" in Austin, Texas. I enjoyed the entire Rocky Horror experience, and recommend to anyone that before watching it on video to go to the nearest theater that plays the movie and has a floor show, to lose your RHPS virginity, the proper way. If you don't have a theater in your area that plays the movie, then the video will be an excellent substitute, and ask the theater managers why they don't show it, as this movie has been a cult favorite for over 20 years now, and is worth any price. Dream it at home, be it at the theater!"
5,The 15th Anniversary,"I recently found a used copy of the 15th Anniversary VHS of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. I must say that I absolutely love it. The prologue and music video are very interesting and entertaining. As for the film itself, well, it's a classic. No video collection can be without this film. The 25th Anniversary two-disc DVD is, without a doubt, the best DVD I have ever seen. The quality of it and the features on it are amazing. ""Don't dream it, be it."""
4,Could the shipping BE any faster???,"My item arrived almost the next day which amazed me considering the time of year.Item is brand spanking new, in packaging, perfect condition, as described.My only gripe is with the subtitles. Although they are off on the tv and are also turned off on the dvd menu it still insists on putting them back on shortly after every re-set. Quite annoying but I'm sure I'll figure out a way to get the dvd set to keep the subtitles turned off. Even with that, I am very happy and would not hesitate to buy from this seller in the future."
5,Love This Movie!,"Not much to say other than I love this movie!! For those who do love this movie, you can't fault this 25th anniversary edition with lots of extra goodies. So glad that I finally bought this movie!"
5,Outstanding,"I got the movie quickly with no scratches and in wrapping. It was like buying it from a store. Not sure that there is a better way to get this movie, but I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
4,Cult classic,"I was leary about watching this movie, but after several recommendations and accolades; I took the plunge. The music in this movie is amazing"
1,"Let's NOT do the Time Warp - ever again, OK?","Contrary to other reviews on this page, this movie is NOT outrageous(if you want that buy Pink Flamingos); it is NOT funny (buy Love & Death for that); it does NOT contain good songs (buy X: The unheard music...now!); and it does NOT deserve the title ""Cult Film"" (Eraserhead - now there's a cult film). Do you wanna know who really loves this film? People who were Theater Majors in college and now work as greeters at Wallmart, that's who. They love it because it gave them a chance to ""rebel"" (although in a safe environment, surrounded by others that considered Meatloaf a cultural icon.). My point? If you want a good Rock 'n' Roll film, check out the one's I've listed above. If you're looking for a middle-of-the-road B movie that wouldn't offend an Iowa corn-farmer, look no farther."
1,This is not a good film!!!!!!!!!,"After I saw this film I wondered ""Why would someone like this?"" It's not funny, the music is bad and it is very weird. Why would someone want to watch a movie about transvestites. WHO EVER WATCHES THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER IS SICK!!!!!!"
1,"Rocky, Horrible Show","Why do so many people like this movie? Because people love degrading spectacle. Much like a Bismarck, this sorry spectacle degrades everyone involved, including the viewer. Transvestitism is a little less than humorous, and a lot less than humourous when it is the only joke. Not that I have a problem with transvestites. Indeed, anybody who decides that being male is not good enough to display publicly dramatically increases the likelihood that a homophobic man will forcibly remove his genitals. ... So, transvestites are good. However, this movie isn't. Now, Welcome to Spring Break is a good movie, as it features many nice episodes that quite possibly were never even considered as part of this trash. In fact, this movie has no creamy filling. A 25th anniversary edition? Why not just buy Where's Waldo."
5,glory glory halleluja,"Ah sweet transsexual land of night, where we will sing and dance once more to that dark refrain, to take that, step to the right. Ah but its the pelvic thrust that really drives you insaaaaaane. and our world will do the timewarp again. now that i own this I can do the time warp again and again and again. Some people of course are too normal for this. If you're snooty and unapreciative of things that are campy and fun and maybe not perfect plotwise, this is not a film for you. if you're mormon, this is not a film for you. if you have problems with any of the following:transvestitesaliensgay peoplesexorgyscorsetsfishnetsbad special effectscripplesincestthis is not the film for you. If you have seen/been to it before and like it, I recomend this completely. It's great to practice AP lines with!!!!!"
4,excelent acting and unforgetable songs,"I absolutly love this movie. The songs are so addictive, I can't get them out of my head. The transvestite is the coolest one of all."
5,I see you shiver with Antici.........................PATION!,"It is the best rock'n'roll sci-fi spoof in the world (probably the only one). The strange journey of Brad and Janet to visit a Dr Scott which turned very, very strange.It is my favorite obsession and should be yours: The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a must for all of you. Let's do the Time Warp again! Let's do the Time Warp again! The Rocky Horror picture Show, Rated 'R' under 17 not admitted with out parent. END"
5,"This Movie Sucks!!! And It Is Not A ""Cult Classsic!!!""","When this waste of celluloid was first made it could not even find a distributor willing to show this piece of junk. For you younger people reading this celluloid is the stuff they used to make movies with. Enough of my History Lesson. This movie proves the Old Adage that movies, just like ageing prostitutes,drunks, politicians and buildings all become respectable with age.This movie is only reedemed by the presence of Tim Curry who I hope got paid a lot of money to star in this turkey of a movie."
3,Force-Fed Classic,"I gave it 3 stars, but only because I have been made to believe this is a classic. This film is fun, but a little too ""Queer Eye"" for regular viewing. I like Tim Curry, and fortunately he has risen above this role. It is painfully obvious that Susan Sarandon has sucked from the earliest stages of her career. View at your own risk. Homophobes beware."
3,Not as good as the hype,"Kinda fun to watch, very campy. I really don't see why folks would go out of their way to dress up and go see it multiple times. But then again, I went to a Renaissance festival recently and saw a bunch of people dressing up to play like dungeons and dragons. Wow, there are a lot of folks who need something real to do!"
4,The Rocky Horror Picture Show (25th Anniversary Edition),"It was amusing to say the least...I couldn't believe that Tim Curry could pull off his part the way he did after seeing him in ""IT"" and ""Home Alone in New York""."
5,Exactly what I needed,"Wife loved it. Couldn't ask for more. She loves RHPS and just destroyed her DVD set, so this was needed and a perfect gift!"
3,"A gem of a musical that started as a smash play in London, then scored a phenomenal success on the midnight ""cult movie"" circuit","A middle-class young couple, motoring in the country on their wedding night, have car trouble in front of a huge mansion... Wanting to use the phone, the two approach the house and go in just as its master, Dr. Frank N. Furter, is leading an experiment... His newly made creature, the body-beautiful Rocky, is ready to be unveiled, and the innocent couple is caught up in this strange household filled with the doctor's campy, exotically dressed admirers... Both the wife and the husband are seduced by this garter-belted ""scientist.""The film's first half is fast and funny, with virtually every song a memorable one... But the second half tries to do too much and the film loses much of its potency... Nevertheless, the adorable characters make this a delightful entertainment..."
4,Just one flaw,"Well here it is again, the glorious Rocky Horror Picture Show with a new edition out after 5 years. It was great as ever. Only one flaw I found, which was mildly irritating, was the audience participation feature. You can go to the main menu and select to have audience participation playing while you view this film. It would have been fine I think if only 5 or so people had done it, but there were so many people yelling things out at once that you could niether hear what they, or the people in the movie, were saying. All the other features were good thou, and I found it to be well worth your money. A great way to view the movie by itself or feel part of the experience."
4,Liberating!,"RIFF RAFF'S FACE = ORGASMOLAND! Oh, and the music's not bad either ;-). Ok, it's definately not for everyone, and I wouldn't even pretend that it's a work of art, but it's just so much damn fun! Tim Curry is spectacularly queeny, daft and sexy, Susan Sarandon has more fun than she's ever had since and everyone wears fishnet stockings! Despite what some people say, I wouldn't describe this film as particularly dirty - in fact, it's a refreshingly exuberent, harmless, _fun_ look at sex. As well as being damn sexy. And the music is addictive, tuneful - trashy maybe, but _good_ trash. And there are some moments in the film that give me the genuine shivers. There's probably no point in trying to ""sell"" it; either you get it or you don't. My advice would be to watch it before buying, take a sense of humour, and have _fun_."
3,The title makes no sense. It doesn't,A cute young (and unusually vocal and out spoken) couple are stranded in the rain and decide to take shelter in a creepy old mansion with a bunch of sexually expressive freaks and are taken advantage of in every way. Pretty queer but also very entertaining romp gives no explainations for the direction of plot development but the musical sequences will have you moving your lips too. The version including the crowd scenes is better.
4,out of synch,"Ok. It's the real thing but, as warned on the packet but NOT in the on-line description, this is a ""double layer"" recording which causes the sound to be frequently ou-of-sync with the image. Annoying but tolerable."
4,Gotta Love the Classics,"Who doesn't love this old classic funny movie? Tim Curry still makes me laugh yet he's one of the best villians of all time. Of course, the picture quality is not quite what we're used to these days with HD and all the other acronyms you can come up with, but this is truly a classic that put these actors on the map with off the wall entertainment!"
5,Classic!,"Crazy, and a fun cult fan pic. If you haven't seen it, you should - just to make up your mind about it. You either love it or don't get it.Now I can watch it on the go."
5,A MUST SEE!!! THE BEST FILM OF THE 20TH CENTURY,"This film is a must see for all Tim Curry fans. One of his best performances to date. I was astounded at the way the movie was funny and serious at the same time. I recommend everyone should see this at least once in their lifetime. I am currently awaiting the re-release of the video, so that I can add it to my collection of Rocky Horror memorabilia."
5,A FAN MUST HAVE,"If you're a Rocky Horror fan, you should have this special Blu Ray edition, it have a great packaging, the extras are great and the movie on Blu Ray definitly rocks (you can see it on B&W or in Color)"
4,MUCH nicer than Betty Monroe's!,"If you are a Rocky Horror geek, this is REALLY worth owning!!! The title posters are beautiful, as is the quality of the picture. The photo booklet is spectacular. The bonus features of the disk are fun for the fans. There is the documentary about finding the cast for the Blu-Ray p-i-p cast which is humorous as well as being an interesting insight to the Rocky Horror community at large. The shadowcast itself is THE most eclectic group of performers from the community. I can honestly say, no one within Rockydom would have thought to put these performers together and yet, what was produced was absolute pleasure! A couple of downers to the disk...the sound. It is yet ANOTHER version of the soundtrack and really nothing spectacular and it would have been really nice to have an Easter egg blooper reel of the shadowcast."
4,Do the time warp again in HD,"I killed my first two copies on dvd of this from overplaying it so when i pirchased this and watched it i nearly passed out with mixed feelings. Its gorgoues in HD and i boticed atleast 20 new details including Frank N Furters lipstick is glittery, party guest noise in background during the minutue or so before time warp. Negatives, colors are off... Brads aeduction scene is now white not blue, the curtains in ose tint changed color and the time warp flashback lost blue tint. Anyway minor detail for a stunning new blu ray onMy shelf"
4,Rocky Horror,Still a hoot after 25 years. Enjoy it every time I watch it. I don't think they could make a movie quite as funny/risque today.Worth a watch if you have never seen it. Enjoy Lisa C
5,'ROCKY HORROR' DVD Orgasmic!,"After 25 years of fish-net stockings, sweet transvestites, doing the Time Warp (again, and again, and again...), and TOAST!, Rocky Horror seems to be destined to become as American as apple pie... Being devoured by those infamous red lusty lips of course!Rocky Horror on DVD is fantastic! Extra features such as the audience participation, VH1 Special excerpts, interviews, and footage of Rocky Horror performed live, including extra DVD-ROM features make even more racious fun for the most unconventional of conventionalists! The only problem I found was with the audience participation track which sometimes was a little hard to hear with all the screaming and shouting of lines.Still, the Rocky Horror Experience is NOT COMPLETE until you have seen it done live, which the DVD has tried to recreate with a fair amount of extra features and Frank-N-Furterish fun! Give in to ABSOLUTE PLEASURE, and check out Rocky Horror on DVD!"
5,"""Dammit, Janet!"" This film is excellent.","Once you've seen it, you're hooked! Believe me we know!After seeing the stage show on a school trip no less, we've been desperately trying to get our hands on anything Rocky related (by the way, if you happen to have access to a copy of the Tim Curry STAGE SHOW version, then let us know).It's a wonderful cult film that you never get tired of watching!Basically, everyone should be made to watch this film atleast once in their lifetime."
5,This movie deserves more than five stars!!!,"Anyone who shrugs this off as a cult movie is missing one of the five greatest movies ever made. But viewer beware! If you watch it once, be prepared to watch it a thousand times. This movie should come with a surgeon general's warning for addictive music! If you're a Rocky Horror virgin, I guarantee you'll say, ""I don't want to watch this!"" at least twice during the movie. Go ahead, try to look away! You'll shiver with antici... pation waiting for the next song, praying to almighty God that it's even half as good as the previous one."
3,Where the hell is the audience Par ti ca pation track?,"The picture quality is marginally better on the BD.The audio is superb.But where the hell is the audience participation track from the DVD?The ""Call back"" is lame, nowhere near complete... what a let down..How can the DVD have much better features at a lower price...20th Century should be ashamed at calling this the 35th Anniversary edition..."
3,"good, but with some major problems","Having owned several 35mm prints of this film and watched many others, I know how this film should look. Overall, this disc looks amazing with intact grain structure and details; however there are 2 major issues.1. For unknown reasons Science Fiction is LETTERBOXED ( within the 1.66 frame which the Fox logo and the rest of the film is in), cutting off the top and bottom of the lips during parts of the song. The entire film was 1.66 on the dvd so this blunder on the Blu-ray is unforgivable.2. The blue tint from Brad's bedroom scene has been removed. The blue tint from the Timewarp flashback has also been removed.I have emailed FOX and have not heard back."
4,Rocky Horror Picture Show- too fun!,"Okay, so what can you say? It's the Rocky Horror Picture Show! Great deal. The ""booklet case"" is interesting. Not the best case design- I think a booklet in the case would have been better. There's a sheet on the back that lists the contents and such which is basically stuck to booklet/case and has a flap that goes over the top and overlaps the front cover and has the Blueray Disc logo on it. That flap is ""taped"" (sticky, easy peel circular sticker)to the front cover to hold the booklet closed- not the best way to keep it all closed up. But, it does contain the US and UK versions of the show!"
1,Hopeless,I was sent a copy that will not play in the US. I was asked to jump throughmany hoops just to get a refund. It was only $9 so I chose not to bother.Don't ever trust this company.
1,The world's WORST movie.....period.,"What an absolute utter piece of garbage. There's a reason why this motion picture...and I use that term loosely in this case...failed miserably when first released. Because it's God-awful and stupid. It was only after many years of playing as a 'midnight movie' that it finally made any money. Even then, the show was frequented by high school drop-outs, hippie wanna-be types and other losers who had nothing better to do than try to act like the idiot characters on the screen. Jeez....not even 'I Spit On Your Grave' or 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' were this bad.With a sincere apology to Tim Curry, who is an otherwise fine actor, but here, he is just one VERY ugly alien transvestite singing silly songs. And his name...Frank-N-Furter? Ooooh...how original. I wonder how many functioning, non-drug addicted brain cells it took to think that up??If this film is your idea of a great movie, well, all I can say is that you have my sympathies......"
1,ZERO stars! What is this crap!?,"I'm very into music but NOT musicals. I was a karaoke DJ for over two years and everyone that came to my bar swore by this movie and performed songs from it. I watched it for the first time today and WOW! What a waste of 1hr and 40min. It took all of my willpower not to turn it off. I sat through it even though it was against my better judgment. Now that I know where ""The time warp"" comes from, I think I could die without hearing that song ever again. There is absolutely NO story line, the characters are NOT relatable and stupid, and the songs all SUCK! What is the big deal about this junk!? I mean c'mon people! ""The sound of music"" was WAY better and underrated. I've come to the conclusion that musicals are not my cup of tea. I know movies and this one should be burned."
1,yawn,never saw this--but it looks boring. what a waste of money. rather spend it on something else. waste of time as well.
5,Excellent Review [ 5 Stars ],"Movie is the best out there, with 2 or more feautres and other hidden stuff unlocked once you put it and play it on your computer. This movie is the most greatest movie yet."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I cant figure this movie out! I watched it on halloween at a friends house. He thought it was the most awesomeist movie but i didnt! Just depends on what movies you like i guess. I think this movie is like ""Dumb and Dumber"" its stupid but funny. I think it could be a must see though! So watch it."
3,"No audio on audience participation callback ""track""","They claim the blu-ray disc has an audience participation callback ""track"" but there is no sound so you can't hear the callback. It's basically just subtitles of what the audience is supposed to call out. Sure would have been nice to hear the callback with an audio track. I wanted to play it for my teenager who never experienced the real thing."
4,"LOVE RHPS, NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE DVD","OK, let me just get this out of the way. I love Rocky Horror Picture show. But...I think they could have done a better job the DVD. The scene selections menu is poorly designed and slow. Also, the outtakes aren't anything to write home about. The idea of including audience participation tracks was a great idea, but the execution left something to be desired. First of all, it doesn't sound like a theater. It sounds like they went to a theater, gathered up a bunch of people and then brought them into a sound studio where they had the movie playing on a TV. If they really wanted to the audience participation experience, they could have actually filmed at a theater so you could see all the sight gags and the people acting on stage.But hey, it's RHPS, so you really can't go wrong here if you don't already own a copy. If you haven't seen RHPS before or have only seen it on TV, GO TO THE THEATER."
2,Hmmm........,"This is an extremely weird movie. Thats what makes it so hard to rate. Its not really scary, or funny either. I guess its just fun to watch and I do like the musical numbers especially The Time Warp, I'm Going Home and Sweet Transvestite."
2,"Okay, whatever...","Although I do think the songs are very good (please note this, Rocky Horror fans, before you start pelting me with rice, rotten tomatoes, dead fish etc) I think that the movie is just too weird. All the actors were great, really throwing themselves into it, but I think the plot is ridiculous. I mean, look at the ending! Also you can't really feel for any of the characters because Janet and Brad are too dumb and goody-goody and everyone else is too weird. Overall I'd rather watch something with a bit more plot and a bit less sensationalism. It actually got (shock, horror) BORING after a while. I mean, seen one pair of fishnet stockings, you seen'em all."
2,Typical Screw Job,"It was very easy to order this movie from Amazon, though it took over six days to receive it even though I was told it would ship the next day. When I played the disk it froze every time I wanted to use the scene location feature. I needed that feature as I'm working with a chorus and we are singing some of the songs from Rocky Horror. The whole reason I ordered this video was because I wanted to learn select songs from it. Unfortunately, I have to fast forward each time to whatever I want to hear."
1,RHPS SPECIAL EDITION IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!,"THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW ""SPECIAL EDITION"" IS NOT WORTH BUYING, THE TWO NEW MUSICALS NUMBERS ARE NOT IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! THERE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE AFTER THE CREDITS,SO ALL YOUR BUYING IS THE SAME OLD MOVIE,THEY DID NOT AD THEM TO THE MOVIE WHERE THERE MENT TO BE....................."
2,music is much better than the movie,The movie is far too weird and over the top. The music is it's real redeeming quality.
3,Disappointed with Video Quality...,"I appreciate the Blu-ray's packaging, booklet, and special features, but I have to say that I prefer to watch the 25th Anniversary DVD rather than the new Blu-ray. I am using a Sony HD LCD TV and a Sony Blu-ray 570 player and the video on the new RHPS blu-ray disc has a ""digital graininess"" that is very distracting."
3,So quake with fear you tiny fools!!!!,"I honestly enjoyed this picture. It ain't great cinema, but it's worth the viewing. Since they don't make musical movies, anymore, ""Rocky Horror"" should be treasured as one the few existing ""rock musical"" films and if the music in the film weren't so catchy, I'd probably dislike this film altogether. Yet it's funny, spoofing science fiction B-movies and becoming one itself. Tim Curry IS Dr. Frank N Furter, and I'd have a hard time imagining that role to someone else. This film is so weird, it's bad and so bad it's good. Transylvania awaits you....."
4,A Sweet Transvestite From Transsexual Transylvania!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present, and I thought it was pretty good. My favorite character was Dr. Frank N. Furter. It was awesome to see Tim Curry dressed as a transvestite and I loved the song he sang about being a sweet tranvestite from transexual Transylvania! It was also awesome to see a young sexy Susan Sarandon being in a bra and panties practically the whole movie. I also loved how it had the classic look of the 70's! I would highly recommend THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW!!!"
5,Do The Time Warp again w/ this 25th Anniversary 2 DVD Set!!!,"This is a great 2-DVD Set for the Rocky Horror Picture Show Fan!!! Includes US and UK Versions of the film that are THX mastered,plus a laboratory full of great extras!!! A real Hot Patootie of a DVD!!! Dammit Janet,this DVD now seems to be out of print,hopefully it will be released again for the fans,the single disc is fine,but this now OOP 2 DVD set Absolute Pleasure!!! If you can find this at a decent price,get it!!! I'm sure in 2010 there will be a 35th Ann. Edition,probably on Blu Ray as well as DVD,but for now,we have this set to enjoy!!!PS don't forget the rice,toilet paper(Scott preferably!)and water pistols!!! Recommended!!!"
5,The Best Rock 'n Roll musical ever!!,"As you hear in the special feature section, this is Richard O'Brien's first musical started off in a small threater. The original casts were used for the movie including Tim Curry, Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn. Nobody in the original cast thought it would become such a subculture. Even today, 'Time Warp' does not have that 'old fashion' feeling.Some people might find music very hard to appreciate for the first time, but as you get to know it you just cannot stop listening and singing along to it.The first time you watch it, you might want to turn it off but keep watching it has something more than homesexuality.You WILL treasure it for the rest of your life!!!"
4,GI with similar experience,"I could really relate to this story about Don Schuman. It was well written. I had known Don and his family in So. Dak. and I was also in the army, in Europe during this time, not with Don, so this bought back many memories, details that I had forgotten. Don made the ultimate sacrifice during the war and I have great sympathy for the way suffered.. and his family suffered. I read the book twice. I am glad to learn more about this man and his life after the war...."
5,The Best Excel Tips & Tricks,"I would recomend this book to anyone who is just learning excel or would like to improve their existing skills. This is not for advanced user. Some intermediate users may find it too basic. I was introduced to his book in one of my computer classes at Cornell University. Since then, I have purchased three more of his excel books."
5,"Excellent, Well-written Book",This is a terrific book. Somehow Wallenbach hits on the issues that frustrate many Excel users. His response to these issues is clever and insightful. This book was immediately useful to me. The day after I bought it I saved hours of time on the job by using Wallenbach's suggestions. This was money well spent.
2,Too hard to find what I need,"While this book provides excellent help -- once you find what you're looking for -- it's just too darn hard for me to find it. So often I'm trying to do something and I don't know how to describe it in the words used by Microsoft -- you know, when you go into the hardware store and say you need a ""thing-a-ma-jig."" How do you look that up in a book that can't ask you anything -- at least in the hardware store the guy/gal asks me enough questions to direct me to what I need."
4,"my favorite since ""thumb wars""","Bat-thumb was good, thumbtanic kinda stunk, blair thumb- pretty good, Frankenthumb- really good. Oedenkirk goes back to his evil/funny ways in this diddy. There are precious little gems in the writing that only Oedenkirk could do, and they are in a German village (so the accents are hysterical). Thumb Fans: rejoice."
4,Nothing Like a Cozy Village Homicide,"Inviting Miss Silver for a visit seems tantemount to requesting a murder. In this post WW II story, a quiet English village is thrown into a tizzy when the local grande dame dies and her son returns to arrange her affairs. There is also a plethora of people who have a reason for wanting to see him dead.Miss Silver in a happy coincidence is visiting an old school chum in the same village; therefore, she is near at hand to use her skills for ferreting out the truth, when a murder does occur.Published not long after the end of WW II, Ms. Wentworth does a better than average job in this particular mystery. Her starcrossed couples are nicely drawn and the mystery is not badly set up."
5,One of my favourite Miss Silver stories,"I've been reading and in some cases re-reading the Miss Silver series, and I must say that I enjoyed this one as much as any of them. It's classic Miss Silver - a little English village, an unpopular landowner, and a whole slew of possible murderers when that unpopular landowner gets murdered. It takes Miss Silver to unravel the plot (just as efficiently as she unravels her wool). There are lots of twists and turns and a few red herrings thrown in. Pretty good stuff!"
5,Awesome,"This is, without a doubt, the best introductory German Text there is. I have tried several and this one answers my questions. I have tried many systems and this is the one. If your school did not select this one, buy it for yourself. Of course, you will need the CD's and the Workbook but if you insist on learning German this is the way."
2,Don't beleive the hype!,"I was very dissapointed with this game. After you read the reviews you tend to think that this game may have something but NO DICE. The game controls are clunky to say the least. The one player mode is not worth playing and the background story is lame. 2 player is a little better but there are only a few levels you can really sink your teeth into. If you've played 1st person shooting games in the past you will notice right away that it lacks the kind of interactive and expansive gun play that other games can provide. Four words, ""don't waste your time!"""
5,"The Fastest, Funnest First Person Shooter Yet!","All I can say is wow, let's play again! This is by far the fastest first person shooter to date. The game can pump out smooth frame rates with one or four players. I had some friends of mine try it, one was a non-gamer. We ended up playing deathmatch for 3 hours straight. The only reason why we stopped was to eat! Everyone loved it. There are many different game modes including some challenge modes. My favorite is a mode where you have to eliminate 100 six foot tall Ducks that relentlessly hunt you down with guns! The controls are a bit different, but can be quite effective once you get used to them. There are an unbelieveable number of playable characters (to be unlocked later) and bots sets that make this game very dynamic. There are several pre-set weapon arsenals to choose from or you can customize your own. All things considered, it is a superior shooter that anyone would love after a little practice."
4,Great game,"This is a great game controls are fully customizable a huge plus considering the default controls are a bit wack.The game only has 9 ""story mode"" levels but they are very fun.The game also has 18 arcade mode levels that you unlock by playing through story mode on the normal difficulty setting the game also has 27 challenge mode levels (very very fun!!)You unlock challenge mode by passing the story mode on the easy difficulty setting.Map maker mode is also a nice touch.This game should provide hours of fun with friends or alone."
5,Goldeneye for Playstation 2!,"Once you've gone through all the levels, check out the challenge mode. ""The Tine Man Trial"" is one of the most intense and exciting five minutes of video game action out there. This game wins in every category, scenery, playability, music and overall creativity. A must for those who've gotten their hands on PS2!"
4,This is one of the top 3 launch titles,"This game actually gets better the more you play it. I recommend it highly. As you progress through the less than amazing storyline, you unlock cool parts of the game (same as Goldeneye). Multiplayer action is faster and fun. If you want an upgraded and better GoldenEye, this is it. Its worth the [price]. (The controls arent that hard to get used to and are great once you get the hang of it.)"
4,Mad fun,"I had an opportunity to test drive this bad boy at the local babbage's and I was blown away! What I especially liked (but it does take a little while to get the hang of) is that you control the character using those two knobs on the bottom of the control pad(one controls forward, backward, and sideways and the other controls the pitch). As soon as I can get a hold of a PS2, I'm getting this one right away!"
3,"Time Splitters, not worth the money.","The controls on Time Splitters was to hard to learn, not to mention there is not a jump button. The graphics are good and reminds me of 007 golden eye. Rent this one first, before you buy."
3,Okayush,"Okay, I wouldn't rate this game as a must-have. Sure its fun and fast, but the one player is rather lame. It also sucks how you have to unlock all the good multiplayer modes so you can't play good ones on the go."
2,HIGHLY HIGHLY DISSAPOINTING,"This game is really bad. I was totally dissapointed with this game. I was thinking that it would be a great game because it is played on a PS2 console but this game is terrible. The graphics are bland and the story mode is terrible. I got bored of this game in 5 minutes. The music is really annoying. The game is just really boring. If you want a first-person shooter buy Unreal Tournament, don't waste your time with this game. This game was, in my opinion, thrown together too quickly just to make the first day rush. If you were planning to buy this game i would highly not recommend this game."
3,Graphics aren't everything,"PS2 may have better graphics, but N64's Perfect Dark kicks the ... out of Time Splitters! I've been a fan of first person shooter games for a while, going all the way back to Wolfenstein and Doom for PC.. As well as a few obscure cheap immitations that I can't even remember the names of, and Time Splitters is one of the worst!The only reasons why Time Splitters ranked 3 stars are A: It is not that often that you can play an old drunk, and B: you can create your own levels. Other than that, just stick with Perfect Dark for N64, and Zone of The Enders for PS2"
1,Queasy,"I bought this game right after I recieved my PS2 because it looked fun. I'm into futuristic stuff, and that's what I was getting from the front of it. However, it is not futuristic other than the fact that there are a couple of characters that are from the future. I hated the game. The controls are extremely hard to master (though it can be done, and I'm sure they can be changed), and you have to spin a lot. It sounds stupid, but it can get you extremely ""motion"" sick and queasy feeling. I took it to a video game place to trade it in, and the guy ended up only giving me about $25 for a barely used game because so many people had traded theirs in.I definitely wouldn't suggest this game."
2,Terrible,"The control of this game is awful. Graphics are average, sound below average and did i mention the horrible contols? Pass on this one and find a better FPS there are several out there."
5,This is Awsome!,I loved this game action action and some more action! I liked how you were able to create your own levels and be able to know every crease of the level i liked this game it was fun
1,I'm sorry,"This game is really lame, I got to play it yesterday when a friend brought his ps2 over to show it off.There is no story, you just get plopped in to the level, the levels are pretty lame, and the monsters are horrid, and many things are modeled all blocky.The framerate is nice and smooth, no wonder though, everything is pretty low poly. and for some reason it takes forever to load the levels... an very long time.Save your money for better games, the SSX game looked pretty beautiful."
4,a good game but a little to hard,This game is pretty good its as good as Time Splitters 2 its just it is very hard to beat on single player mode.maybe i'm just no good at it though. The graphics are the same as its sequal as is the gameplay and any fan of games like Golden Eye will like it
2,"OK, but hard to control","This game is different for a First Person Shooter...quite a bit different concept that most games, but is too difficult to control."
5,My daughter and I play this for hours,"My daughter; who is 8, and I play this game for hours on end. She loves it and I (44 years old) enjoy it a lot as well. We play as a team and work our way through each of the different areas. Not only is it fun for both of us it helps to build team work. We find ourselves laughing and working together a lot. Finding a game that allows us to work together rather than to fight each other is very good change."
4,TimeSplitters is a non-stop action romp in the PS2 woods,"This game is enthralling from the very beginning where u must get an item that's inside a mummy's tomb. From the very beginning, u must dodge bullets and shoot everyone that gets in your way. Nobody can stop the TimeSplitters except u, so give em a shotgun shell to the face.This game is fast, fun, but not a very good game when it comes to depth. So if ur looking for a party game or a game u can play with ur friends- THIS IS THE GAME!"
2,Not as good as Goldeneye or Perfect Dark,"Although a decent FPS, it fails in comparison to the N64 titles that have dominated the console FPS market, Goldeneye and Perfect Dark. Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed."
2,"Graphics good, control terrible","OK, I admit the graphics, special effects, and other small details are awesome. But the controls plain out .... You HAVE to use both of the analog sticks to move around, you don't even have the option to use the control pad (which I always use). If you're a joystick person, you'll like it, if not, you'll go crazy after playing 5 minutes.If only they had different types of controls like in Goldeneye (where they had 1.1,1.2,1.3, etc.).The small things are great in this game, like the graphics, they glass shattering when you shoot through it, and the explosions are all great.But a game with ... controls is a total waste of time."
1,Control?,"I wanted to love this game, but the controls made it impossible to play. I'm shocked at the love fest this has generated, given the awfull control options. A little code to support a USB mouse would have been greatly appreciated here! I spent all my time trying to get my cross hairs aimed at something while getting plugged full holes. I had a few ideas about configuring the control layout to make it playable, but the rigid pre-defined choices wouldn't allow it. Traded it within a few days for something that was actually fun to play. Rent it, and see if you can live with the controls first!"
5,First Person shooter as good or better than GoldenEye,"I bought this after reading a few glowing reviews. I am totally satisifed. You can play the arcade mode to unlock stages which are fun with or without a human partner. If you play with a human parter however you do not unlock the cool stuff that comes along when you beat stages one player.The battle mode is fun and has great scenarios for play. You can create your own battle stages, but I find the interface very confusing. I am sure it will work fine once I put time into learning it, but it could have been designed for easier use. This is a must have game for anyone with a PS2. Great fun for 1-4 players."
4,Great Multiplayer Game!,This game has some tricky controls but they are fine once you get used to them. Whoever thought up the story didn't do so well but they sure invested a lot of time in the multiplayer. One great feature is that you can create your own maps to play on. If you like multiplayer gaming this is a must.
3,Wonderful at first,This game was one of the better ps2 games I had bought at first but then as my friends I played it more and more I grew bored of it. The game has a definite sense of humor when it comes to the characters and can choose and even the challenges in challenge mode. If you buy this game do not buy it for its story. You will be very very disappointed. The multiplater is what rocks this game at first. The whole time you play it your trying to get more characters and cheats you can use during multiplayer. You even unlock lots of new levels as well. This game even includes a level editor where you can create your own levels. That kicks some butt as well but after a while like I said I just grew tired of it. It may just be me because my friends have borrowed several times and they still love it.
2,rent it first,This game Has ps1 graphics all over it. Dont expect much from this game its not worth the 50 bucks. So if you want to buy this game just rent it first.
4,Great multiplayer game.. single player a bit lacking though,"Out of the 4 release titles that I have purchased, this it the only one I still play with friends. The multiplayer part of it is really addicting, and is still great fun to play. The graphics looks smooth and run at 60fps at all times even during battles with four people on screen.The only real complaint I have is the single player part lacking any real cohesion. It mostly acts just to unlock stuff for the multiplayer mode, and I don't really find the single player that fun. The single player mode is also real difficult, so I have often been frustrated trying to unlock some level and being glad it's over with when I finally do.It's still a must own game for the PS2 for the multiplayer mode. Make sure you have a multi-tap and some friends to fight with when you you buy this game."
4,This Game is pretty cool.,"This game is pretty fun.I got it at Christmas and are still playing it.Everyone talks about how good the single player is,but it isn't that good.The graphics are awsome,but it just doesn't really have a good plot and the controls are weird.You can adjust them,but the sight is to fast to really aim with.The multiplayer is the best thing about this game.You have a bunch of different characters and levels, and guns.There are many scenarios to play, and the best part is that you can make your own level.If you get this game, get it for the multiplayer."
3,Nice PFS game like Bond and Perfect Dark -,"The game has the feel of Perfect Dark meets Quake to it. The only complaint I have is the controls, it takes time to get used to and makes it really tough to move around and shoot at the same time.Another great thing about this game that there is no slow down with the number of bots you put in when you are playing a two player game unlike Perfect Dark.If you are looking for a fast paced game like Quake 3 or any other great First Person Shooter games like Golden Eye, this is the game to get!"
3,Latest album? Not really...,"This isnt their lastest studio effort at all. Its a compilation of rare tracks, demos etc. Die-hards will probably eat this up, most people will probably chew on it time to time. Not bad, but not worth full price."
4,great deal for the price,"This ipod case does the job and is well worth the low, low cost. It does collect a bit of dirt and dust, which happens with any silicone case. It works well and I have no complaints."
4,my go-to knife,"I have the 4 1/2 inch version of this knife. It is the knife I reach for for almost any cutting in the kitchen. It has held a good edge for the last two years. A week ago, the end broke. I did not see it happen - just lost the end. My high-end German knives have other problems, so I'd say this is a very good deal in a decent knife for everyday use. Or you can pay $50 for a German knife that will probably bend at the tip after a few months (like mine do)."
4,Very Informative,"Wheels by Arthur Hailey, takes place in Detroit, Michigan during the 70's and is about the many different levels of the automobile industry, from the rich and powerful auto executive to the poor and overworked assembly line worker. Hailey researches his topic well before he begins to write and in this novel he exposes all of the corruption that takes place in the auto industry, like crooked dealerships, crime syndicates within the factories, and executives who twist the books to make a profit.Wheels is a good book if you like novels that are informative because there are tons of info jam packed into this book; but there really isn't a whole lot of action and with the way that Hailey switches from character to character, it is hard to find out who the main character is and what his struggle is. I would read this book if you are interested in the auto industry and want to learn more about it. I wouldn't read it if you are looking for a book with action in it because it will bore you."
2,Not to Standards,"I've read Hotel, Evening News and The Moneychangers so I picked this up based on Hailey's name only. Luckily I only spent a quarter on it at a library sale. I have ten pages left and am still trying to figure out what exactly is the plot. It's not a terrible read (I would have put it down if it was) but it never really gets going. Some of the characters are developed but the one I believe is supposed to the main character (Adam Trenton) is not. None of the characters are as developed as in the other books I have read by this author.I'd pass on this one."
1,Disappointed,"I am not a time travel reader so if that is not your choice either you won't want to buy this book. It has many funny and comical situations in it. But when I am reading a romantic story, comical and funny should not be the main topic. There also wasn't anything sexy or sexual about this book. I had a hard time visualizing the children's toys in the story and what roll they played. Maybe better luck next time."
4,Amusing...with a surprise nod at the end,"An sweet, amusing tale of love across time and air space. Kathy Barett's had a rotten end to a hectic day, when her car breaks down in the cold. After asking the powers that be to give her warmth, comfort and a subserviant male Kathy Bartlett instead finds herself, her cell phone, her hair supplies, and her bag of toys (including an odd number she dubs Peter) traveling back through time to meet a sinfully sexy Scotsman, The Pleasure Master, Ian Ross. The love scenes in this book are delicious, and the reactions to Kathy's bag of toys, particularly Peter, are wonderful, making me laugh out loud. It wasn't until the very end that Peter, the troublemaker's, secret is revealed, but he's been seen before...sort of. (See Nina Bangs', An Orignal Sin) Nice nod back. I'd definitely read her work again."
3,funny but a little on the weird side,This is the first time i've read one of Nina Bangs books.. I am a lover of time travel romance and enjoy the twist and turns that most time travel books provide.. This book however was a tad too weird even for my taste.. Parts of the book were hysterically funny and had me rolling with tears in my eyes and a drastic need for oxygen but the unbelievable Mechanical Peter... and his movie one liners were not even remotly believable... I found the end very lacking and the lack of anything truely physical and steamy until the last chapters a real let down... Overall the book was amusing but not a keeper on my shelves and certainly not one I would pass on to friends.. I think i would be too embarassed ..
2,"Cute, but...","Bought the book when I saw the cover...interesting. The story was OK and I enjoyed it once I got into it, but there were so many unbelievable things that wouldn't really happen in time travel, like Kathy's phone working in 1542. Kathy appeared a little ditsy in the first part of the book. Loved the way Peter would always use movie quotes throughout the story and Ian's cat was an interesting character. The biggest disappointment to me was the ending...felt like it was a cop-out. It left me hanging on what happened to Ian. The author should have gone into detail about what Ian experienced at the end."
2,Not so great...,This is a pretty expensive DVD and not a lot of substance to it. My daughter has Moto 1 and 2 and even she said Moto 3 is lacking. Think of saving your money on this one.
2,disappointed,big fan of the show inside the outdoors and thought this was made by the same guys . its not .
3,Nice game...,"Bought this for my fiance as we just purchased an atari at an auction. He said it brings back the memories of when he used to play. Of course it's very basic, like other atari games, but it worked well and arrived quickly."
2,disappointed,"The photo reproduction quality was very poor in my copy. Images were blurred and muddy and dark, details of uniforms and vehicles completely obscured. Some of the same pictures were in the McGuirl/Spezzano GD photohistory, and when you compare the two there is just no contest, the other one is clearly superior. In addition the photo selection was really not that interesting compared to the Spezzano book. The list with photos of Knight's Cross recipients is valuable, but felt more like filler to me in an already slender volume. I don't like returning books if I can help it, but this one went right back."
5,really good quality,"I totally recommend these longjohns, & Im relieved that america can still make a product that's cheaper and better quality than imports."
3,It's okay,"It's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okayIt's okay, a little bit fat."
2,Thermal bottoms,"While these bottoms are warm, they don't fit very well (long in the waist area) and Iwould not recommend them. I have tried different brands of these all in the small size,(I am 6 foot and thin) and some fit very well while others don't. They are all long enough,but some of them fit weird in the waist area, (length, not width) go figure."
5,Nice and warm. May be little higher priced at 15 USD,I am satisfied with the product. Warm enough for moderate winters. But you may get it for less at Burlington or Gabriel stores.
3,wrong size,The product received was not the size ordered and had to be returned. The company responded well and sent the correct item.
2,hatd life,"IT's warm and comfortable, since I choose the ""middle"", i figure it should be just suitable for my body. But it's a little to long for me.Also, the piture shows that it includes cloth and trousers but in fact there are just the trousers..... I have a feeling that I'm cheated!..."
5,A very helpful book to help you find your place in your adult kids lives,"I thought I was the only one who felt like I could never say the right thing to my adult children. We were so close when they were at home and always understood that whatever I said, I wanted only the best for them. Once they were married and had homes and kids of their own, I felt a sense of loss along with the joy. Sometimes when I spoke to them the same way I thought I always had, I was met with a look or a comment that let me know I was overstepping my bounds. It takes time and sometimes hurt feelings to find the new boundaries and to know that they still love you and want to be close - just differently. I'm learning that on my own but this book made me feel much better knowing my situation isn't unusual. I highly recommend it!"
5,A Gift to all Parents of Adult Children,"If you have children who are about to leave home...or if they're already gone, you need to read this book. In a humorous and easy to read style, Jane Adams will guide you through the difficulties of dealing with adult children. She will also offer ways for you to be less of a parent and more of a friend. One of the true gifts of this book is the advice she gives that you should allow your children to have their own version of their childhood without them having to defend it. This relieves so much tension between parents and their children! This book is a great platform from which your future parent/child relationship can grow."
5,Great for New Golfers,This video really helped me get off on the right foot as a new golfer! I've seen people whose mental games I did not want to imitate. My mental game is already better than most other golfers. Thank goodness for this tape.
4,nursing education,"adequate resource for my nursing education course. does not include mentoring or preceptorship, which was my presentation topic."
3,Oh Susan George!,"Well as B grade 1970s horror/supernatural flicks go it is pretty cool...and campy. The main reason I bought this flick is for Susan George. I have always liked her even though she was never going to win an Oscar. Check her out in Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry with Peter Fonda and with Dustin Hoffman in Straw Dogs. Both much better films. The story is kind of interesting but the movie has not aged well. You can tell for sure it was made in the early 1970s. Anyway, a good flick to have several friends over for to get ripped and then rip the movie I guess. But hey don't any of you rip Susan George!! RIP Edward Albert (2006) and Doug McClure (1995), both making movies elsewhere."
2,Borderline mentally challenged,"Ever watch one of those films where bad stuff is happening to a group of people and NO ONE talks about it ? Where the folks are doing self destructive things and out-of-character things in a place they've been informed is haunted but they don't leave ? Except to shop or work or do practical things , whereupon they return and resume the odd and damaging behaviors ? You have now . Don't . Just don't . You're better and SMARTER than this idiotic picture . Give yourself some credit . Nice T & A though . Nice T & A ."
2,susan george yes,unfortunately this the worst movie i have ever seen her in.she is not in the movie near enough and eddie albert is wretched as an actor. not worth owning.
1,Me so Lame! The House where evil Dwells: Should be the house where Lame Dwells.,"This movie is lame plain and simple, typical Horror movie, why would anyone stay in a 200 year old place? Why you go back to a place you were told not to? Is it because the Couple is American? Or is the viewer expects nothing less. The movie did not scare me but bored me."
2,Disappointed,Maybe time has just passed it by and it's not as scarry as it may have been when first released.
3,it never really got going,"House Where Evil Dwells gets off to a great start. An unfaithful woman, a lover and a angry husband meet in old Japan and you get to see it super slow motion what a ticked off guy with a samurai sword can do. Fast forward a few 100 years. An American family (Where did they get these dreadful actors?They make Raymnond Burr in Godzilla look like Orson Wells in Citizen Kane) comes to stay in a house built where the murder/suicide happend. The original occupants of the house have never left and like all Japanese ghosts they make their presence known. Then the movie just seems to curdle. Maybe it is just too subtle for the American audience but I was bored and half way through chose another movie."
5,HOUSE WHERE EVIL DEWELLS,ONE OF THE BETTER JAPENSE MOVIES DONE N ENGLISH & JAP. HAS LOTS OF ACTION THRU OUT W/DEAD PEOPLE TRYING TO TAKE THE LIVING & SHARE WHAT HAPPEN 2 THEM
2,"MMM... mommy, it's not so good.","Aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting, this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia. I can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a ""good movie."""
5,Excellent Book!,"This book is definately one of the best I've ever read. It contains just the right mix of adventure, mystery, romance, and history. I'd recommend it for both young and old."
5,VERY GOOD BOOK,I think this is definitly the best book by Brouwer I have ever read! It is about Druids (heard of them?) and Merlins (haven't heard of them?) and the struggle between them in the 1300's.
4,Not the item pictured,The Cd was ok but it wasn't the exact track listing I thought Iwas getting. I wanted the 40th aniversary edition but was sent the Golden aniversary edition.
3,Not what I ordered,"I should have read the other reviews before ordering this volume. I bought it for Cathy Young's ""A Thousand Stars"" and it was not on this volume. Other than that all the other songs are great."
4,Love it,"I bought this for my mom and she loves it! There's maybe a few songs she isn't too into , but she likes most of them. That's all that matters. My only issue is that some of the track listing on Amazon is messed up."
3,It's OK but-,At least two of the songs have the wrong artist listed. If I had known that I would not have purchased the CD.
4,Good Movie,"I just recently saw ""The Desert Fox"" and I was suprised at how good it was usually films done in the 50s about real people make them out to be either super heroes or terrible villians. This film really showed the human side of Rommel and his family. I would like to see this film released on DVD someday."
1,I dont like it,I think the show stinks or in other words bites!!! I dont like it because it is black and white .
4,a good old film,"this is cult film, i did not buy it for graphics. James Mason is a very good actor. Its interesting how these old films are still good."
5,DVD features a nice transfer of a great film,"I recently saw an advance review copy of the DVD ""The Desert Fox"" and I was surprised at the nice quality of the transfer of what is an exceptional movie. Based on the exploits of the famed German general Erwin Rommel the DVD has a crisp clean transfer. Included on this disc is the original theatrical trailer which remarkably, considering it's age, is also reproduced here in relatively good condition.Considering it's low price this addition to the Fox War Classics catalog is easy to recommend."
4,A splendid movie and a bravo James Mason performance!,"This is a superb movie dealing with the great German general, Erwin Rommel, dubbed ""The Desert Fox."" Surprisingly, the movie deals rather tersely with the famed North African campaign, and instead focuses largely on the period after this time, when Rommel becomes disaffected with Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, and conspires against Hitler. While basically true, this causes the movie to be an incomplete and imperfect portrayal of Rommel.Despite its flaws, this movie is well worth watching and owning. James Mason is very authentic as Rommel. The movie is narrated by Michael Rennie, and this narration significantly adds to the quality of the film. Overall, a fine war film about a great subject which is made even better by the fact that it is true to history, albeit incomplete."
3,Rommel - the good German,"This movie is ok, but it's not fantastic. It tries to protray Erwin Rommel in a good light, as a good German who fought for his country, but was not a Nazi. I wonder wether this movie made in the 1950's, was made as a bit of Cold War properganda, to win over the German's and to protray the German's in a good light to people in the West. I also wonder if Rommel had surivived the war, would he have gone into politic's, like Eisenhower and De Gaulle??"
4,The Desert Fox,This is a great movie to add to your 'War Movie' collection. A presentation of the war from the German side. A glimpse into Hitler'strue character.
5,ROMMEL,"One word ........ OUTSTANDING!!!!! Anyone that considers themself to be a WWII buff MUST have this DVD. It's not a shoot em' up war movie ,It's about the man and his convictions . It's about one the greatest miltary minds in history.If you don't have this in your collection BUY IT NOW!!!"
4,"""Whatever Happened To The Desert Fox?"" would be a better title.","Released just six years after the war, this film would have satisfied the WW2 audience that would have heard plenty about Rommel in the newsreels and newspapers of the day, but had also been mystified about his abrupt disappearance. Consequently, a modern audience really needs more of a background about WW2 to appreciate what they are seeing here. Rommel gave tacit approval to the attempt on Hitler's life, and was arranging with other military leaders to take control of the situation after his death, in the hope of holding a firm line. But one of the conspirators does point out the risk that with Hitler, the Allies might not even stop at a truce before invading Germany itself, because of everything else that had already happened under his regime. Interesting, but certainly not a complete biography on the man."
4,It worked for me.,"This product has worked for me on XP SP2 without problems.It connects to my Motorola phone to transfer ringtones, addresses. It maintained connectivity beyond 20 feet.I've had the product for several weeks, and don't have anycomplaints.The included driver disk has an old version of the drivers.Go to ftp://ftp.kensington.com/bt , and download the 4.0.1.2400 driver."
1,Why on Earth doesn't it support Audio/Headset service?,"So, I just recently received a bluetooth headset for a christmas gift, which is cool, and I had the idea of buying a USB adapter for my computer to allow it to be used as a wireless headset for my computer (as I do voice chat over the internet a lot). The OS (I'm using an OSX 10.3.6 machine right now) detected the device fine, but I found that I couldn't use the headset as an input or output. Confused, I went to Kensington's website and found that lo and behold, the adapter doesn't support the Audio Gateway or Headset services. What in the? Avoid like the plague. Just be smart and get the Linksys."
2,What a pain.,I have needed the drivers for this device and had hours and hours of fun finding them online. Support for this device is pretty bad....
1,Horrible introduction to the world of bluetooth,"Apparently the bluetooth ""standard"" is not a standard at all. After a great deal of fighting, I was finally able to pair this with my motorola headset. But that was as far as I got. I can't get it connected and constantly get the response that a connection could not be obtained. Once I got connected as a fluke but only for a ""good"" strength connection even thought the headset was 2 inches away and the connection did not result in any response with the software I wanted to use it with. Connection dropped spontaneously a minute later. Complete garbage. However, if anyone knows of a bluetooth adapter that actually works, I'd love to hear about it."
3,OSX users -- avoid this one.,This adapter isn't compatible with 10.3.5 OSX. It will get you up and running but causes kernal panics and other problems. Just thought I'd save somebody some grief. I'm sure it's a fine adapter on other platforms.
3,i intended to use this for my wii remote but was unable currently to get it working,i intended to use this for my wii remote but was unable currently to get it working
2,save your money,"Unless you know absolutely nothing about kayaks, don't waste your money. I was looking for something to help me decide about the purchase of a tandem kayak. This book was not at all helpful."
3,A quirky little nature book,"This odd little book explores connections between plants, bugs and their habitat. Illustrations are line drawings. It is arranged alphabetically by plant name and each entry describes the plant and its natural associates.Very little is said about the author's qualifications, so one must, I guess, assume that he knows whereof he writes.A very limited list of plants is covered, with many major ones omitted. Some of the taxonomy is dated (and may have been wrong when it was written) eg including poison ivy in the Rhus genus.I can think of better ways to spend money."
4,Dry fast,"Great product despite the loud noise. It dry my toy poodle in less than 10 min. Lightweight, easy to carry around. Only it will be greater if they comes with warm air. that will be perfect."
5,Great pet dryer Made in the USA,I have 3 dogs to keep clean. I did not ever plan on 3 dogs and they must be clean to be in my house. This pet dryer makes things much easier. I love not having wet dogs wandering around.
5,Should have purchased this a long time ago!,"Just got this today, so had to immediately unbox it and try it out. I am IMPRESSED! This little dryer packs a wallop of air and does a really great job - drys Bichon and Poodle hair FAST! Great product!"
5,Great transaction/product!,"I've been using this dryer for years (same brand, diff dryer) @ the self-wash pet place. It's amazing, and I have a Husky!"
5,Excellent,"Do not know how could I live without this blower before, I have 3 aussies, 2 of them have very heavy coat, this blower is excellent, still try to learn the best ways and how much air and all, but it is sturdy, not cheap chinese plastic, and it blows air very good.great buy."
3,This dryer is Noisy but effective.,"Do not buy this dryer if you are looking for a quiet dryer. I purchased this dryer because a couple of reviews on this site said the dryer was very quiet. That is not true. This thing is as noisy as a cheap leaf blower. Anyone that says it is quiet is either working for the manufacturer or have their hearing aid turned off. If you want a very effective and quick dryer, then this is a good buy. I purchased it to dry my husky puppy. He hates the noise (so do I) but after a restraining him and feeding lots of treats, he is slowly learning to tolerate the noise. The dryer does work very well. It drys my husky completely in about 20 minutes. I have no intention of returning the dryer. Knowing how well it works I can tolerate the noise. So if you want a very effective dryer, buy this one but, be warned, it is NOT QUIET."
1,Too small a case. Not worth the price.,My Olympus C4040Z does not even fit in this case.Quality of construction is also not very good. Uses velcro for closing the case :-(I am returning it.
3,Not for all Olympus cameras,"The camera case itself is nice leather,the package arrived quickly and safely but your advertising is indeed misleading as one of your own reviews shows. Unfortuately, we did not read all the reviews before ordering. Our camera is an Olympus 720 Ultra Zoom. This case is not suitable for it."
1,On-line Specifications Not Accurate (no 7X compatability),"The product is not combatible with the C7X (C720) cameras although it is advertised as such. The product spec. delivered with the packaging is accurate, only C2X - C5X. It does not fully close (open on sides) with no camera, the picture is misleading. I will be returning this product."
1,Waste of money,"This case sucks, pure and simple. The camera barely fits in there, the top doesn't stay shut worth a hoot, and there's no room for extra batteries, or much else of anything. The sides and tops are v/ thinly padded, and let's just say the word ""synthetic"" needs to be inserted in front of leather. The material is of low quality and thin. There is no carry strap, so you must have the strap on your camera, so when you want to take pictures you have to take the camera out of the bag and unhook the catch loop of the bag from the camera strap. If you forget to reattach the loop, and put the camera back in the bag and sling it on your shoulder, prepare on losing the case, because as I said before, the flap doesn't stay closed. This is the reason my case went bye-bye last weekend w/ extra memory cards in it. I look at the positive side and figure at least I can get a good case now. Do yourself a fawor and don't buy this case."
1,Does not fit all C-Series,"This camera case fits only the C-2000Z, C-3000Z & C-4000Z cameras by Olympus. It is not for all C-Series cameras as the ad would have you to believe. While there is probably nothing wrong with the case itself, I was mislead by the advertising here."
2,Not for Olympus C700 camera,"It's an OK camera case for small cameras, but an Olympus C700 will not fit."
1,If this is for the C-Series~Why doesn't it fit!,"This was an optional accessory for the C - 720...but I can tell already it will NOT fit! How confusing! Why it is called the C-Series case? AND, no strap? What's up with that!"
5,Perfect for camedia c series,"I don't by the Olympus bag for the bad reviews...so y bought other, a tremendous bag, ok for Indiana Jones. Forget what you have heard. The olimpus bag is perfect for c series, beliveme my c 4040 fits ok, and is small¡¡¡¡¡, and not heavy. So if u are thinking , in a litlle bag, to protect your cam, buy this.The only thing: it only works to carry your cam with you, don't pretend to carry nothing more."
3,good basic protection - but not the best design,"I puchased this case when the camera was new. It looks fine and is good enough for the protection against average bumps. It has enough space for the basic needs to carry with it. I carry 4 memory cards and two sets of extra batteries in it. I only wish it had more positive closures like snaps or clips, and that it had its own neck/shoulder strap.You still need a bag to carry other camera accesories, and this case is not so bulky, so it fits in gadget bags better."
1,False Advertising,"I couldn't find a case that was meant for my camera, so I looked around and found this one. According to the measurements on Amazon it's ""8.3 x 5.5 x 3.3 inches"". That would have been plenty of room for my camera and a few accessories as well, so I bought it and it arrived today. At first I thought they must have sent me the wrong one. Nope, it's the correct case. The problem is that it only measures 5 1/4 x 4 3/4 x 3 inches and my camera won't fit into it."
1,Don't let the picture fool you!,"Bag is much (read much, much) smaller than in the picture. Had to stretch to fit my C-700. Never saw a more useless bag. Doesn't even have a shoulder sling belt. Only got a belt loop but both the bag and camera are too heavy to attach it to your waist belt.Also no room for anything except a couple of batteries and memory cards.Wish I could give lower than 1 star rating. This bag doesn't deserve any star rating.Olympus shouldn't have put its name on it.JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
2,Case is Too Small for Olypus D-510 Zoom and Gear,"I typically want a case that will cary 1 or 2 sets of spare, AA Batteries, Plympus SmartMedia cards, camera and possibly my AC Olympus charge when I fly to various photo sites. This case is simply too small for that."
1,HORRIBLE,"This game was very bad, not to mention Overpriced (80 bucks for maracas?). Yeah sure it was fun at the beginning, but after a while the fun factor just started to rub off."
4,USC Fan,"Now that I live in this part of the country, the southwest, I can pester my ASU alumni types at work. :) I know they'll love me for it. I do wish more teams, college or pro, had these?"
5,Nice gift,I bought this as a gift for friend in canada and i live in the states he like it it was delivered on time and everything was good he was so happy.
3,magnetic poetry,The magnetic poetry kit was shipped on time. It was a christmas gift. The person i gave it to was very happy to get it.
3,Kind of sorry I bought it,"I am a little sorry I bought this ""Sexual Innuendo"" version of the Magnetic Poetry Kit. Without indulging in actual obscenities, there are plenty of nouns here that can be used suggestively (""pussy,"" ""banana,"" ""johnson"" etc.), but there were too few verbs, risque or otherwise, also far too few prepositions or pronouns. Perhaps I am just not imaginitive enough in this realm, or perhaps I should have started with a more basic set for a more full-bodied syntax. (Or perhaps I should double-down and buy a slightly dirtier competitor, but not now.) Also, my particular version -- the kit I received anyway -- did not contain ""over 400"" words as stated in the product info. My count was a little shy of 350, and of these a number are repeats, such as an ""s"" for plural, ""it"" and ""d."" This is the first time I've bought any such set, but it doesn't quite work for me. Workmanship (made in China) is okay."
1,Pioneer CT-W103 Dual cassette deck,This deck is about as bottom end as you can get. No record level adjustments.No Head Phone Jack or Mic inputs. I have a problem getting the record level up to a suitable level for recording from tape line out of my amp.You can do better buying a cheap mini stereo with dual cassette at Wal Mart for about $...
4,An R&H favorite!,"Easily one of the greatest musicals of all-time, Carousel offers quite a bit! John Raitt makes his best Broadway appearance in this musical! This musical is easily comparable to Oklahoma! because of the style of music and a somewhat similar plot. Even musically, the beautiful IF I LOVED YOU echoes Oklahoma's PEOPLE WILL SAY WE'RE IN LOVE. YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE is the most powerful tune of this musical. JUNE IS BUSTIN' OUT ALL OVER is a robustious and happy song! Despite some hiss in the sound, the album is still a winner!"
5,A Classic of the Genre,"Despite being radically shortened to fit on ten sides of a 12"" 78rpm record album, Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest score has not been better served on disc than this original 1945 Broadway cast recording. One may yearn to hear the entire bench scene (""If I Loved You""), but what's there is both powerful and delicate (and has never been better performed). John Raitt and Jan Clayton are the best Billy and Julie on records; and Jean Darling and Eric Mattson match them every step of the way as Carrie and Mister Snow. Murvyn Vye and the late Christine Johnson also add strong vocal support.I recognize that this lengthy, complex score cries out for a complete recording, but even when one finally emerges it will only be a supplement to this peerless original."
5,About the Orchestrations:,"In response to Anthony Barkdoll's criticism of the originalorchestrations to Carousel's 1945 Broadway Cast:According to Rodger's autobiography, ""Musical Stages,"" RobertRussell Bennett did, in fact, orchestrate the original ""MisterSnow"" for the 1945 Broadway Cast album, until other projectscaused him to be sidelined."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time,"Yikes. I bought this based on the reviews (and because I prefer the original cast recordings as well). But quite frankly, this album is no fun to listen to. If you like Sound of Music, Cinderella, and that style, you will not like this. It is very dense, and somewhat tortured sounding, as is the story. Robert Russell Bennett is not involved in the orchestration, so that may account for the music. And the wry humor and satirical, yet loving insights that I expect from Hammerstein are missing as well. Unlike most of their other albums, this one sounds old and dated, and ready for the grave."
2,Missing Pages,It's a great book and most informative but several pages are missing. While finishing page 244 this pamphlet skips to page 277. This is the last book of a trilogy and I'm feeling cheated behind these missing pages. It looks like a mistake from the publisher because there are like no pages torn out. Had it not been for the missing pages my rating would excel to five stars.
5,Book 3 of Triology,"Together all three books in Johnson's ""American Empire Project"", Blowback, The Sorrows of Empire, & the final one, Nemesis should serve as a wake-up call to the dangers facing this country & the sobering thought that the last days of the American Republic might actually be at hand. These are not the only good books written on this subject but they're among the best I've read. I thoroughly enjoyed them. They should be read in the chronological order in which they were written. Excellent treatment of a truly scary subject. Well done!"
5,Should be compulsory reading.,"ANY AMERICAN who respects the US CONSTITUTION and loves their country, this book should be read by everyone; starting from the ages 17 to 110! Plus read in ALL the high schools, particularly in the junior and senior years."
2,While he was alive Chalmers would be Mitt Romney's nemesis.,"Another America booking showing that the best thinkers believe America is doomed. Chalmers Johnson has passed away now. R.I.P. This book is still relevant. He argued that we should cut defense spending. However, maybe he is wrong. Defense spending might be the best way to unite America. Vote Mitt Romney for President if you think defense spending is a good way to unite the USA! I know I am. And, it is not that we need better defense. We, as a society, need something to unite us, such that we can pick ourselves up by our bootstraps."
2,He picks the facts that support his thesis and ignores the rest,"Yea this is an important book, it says things that need to be said out loud.However, please take it with a bucket of salt. He cherry picks his ""facts"" and ignores virtually everything else.For example: I served in the military under SOFAs in Germany and Thailand and view them in an entirely different light. If we force young people to serve in another country then we need to protect them from legal system they don't understand. Instead, military justice is imposed. My experience was that this was fair to everyone concerned.If you trust Rush Limbaugh and such to give you all the information that you need... then you will love this guy. However, if you are interested in really understanding the issues, then you need to read more authors than Johnson. He provides (like Limbaugh) only one, very biased but interesting view of the world."
1,"C. Johnson: Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic, New York, Holt, 2007","This book reminds me of World War II propaganda. Believable, often-true facts are sorted and handpicked to support a one-sided angry argument.The author is so shrill in his invective, that all hope of discussion is lost. He offers no solutions, except to suggest a military coup on page 269.In the last paragraph, Johnson aptly worries that his demise might echo that of his role model, Hotsumi Ozaki, hanged by his country [Japan] as a traitor."
1,Friends Don't Lend Bad Books To Friends - This Is LAME,"My friend (now in question) let this for me to read with the highest praise. As a History Major who slogged yet delighted through such masterful works as Edwin Gibbons The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire to Machievellis The Prince this was a painful read.I agree that our dollar is over valued, the interest on the national debt is woeful but this country is not Rome in a million ways. DONT BUY THIS BOOK. BE WARY WELL MEANING SOCIALIST LIBERALS KOOKS (whom you once perceived as rational....perhaps my radar is faltering with age) WHO TRY TO LEND IT TO YOU."
4,An excellent film,"A film about divorce could be funny, I suppose. This film was listed as a black comedy, and it DOES have elements of humor, in the form of the practical jokes that the competing spouses did to each other. This, sadly, is not so far fetched, as any divorce attoreny will have WILDER stories to tell, with much more destruction resulting from the spouses fights.A divorce ending a formerly happy marriage is a tragedy; if you want to see an excellent portrayal of the depths of what people approaching separation can reach, then this is for you. It is definitely not a film that you would ever replay on DVD."
4,"Still good but starting to become ""Dated""","When I first saw this movie, I found it most enjoyable. Now in 2008, it has lost some of its humour. However, it is still a good & very watchable movie - but it is no londer a ""great"" movie."
5,A really interesting movie!,"Once you see this movie its hard to forget! Have been married for 41 years, never divorced, and after viewing this movie would never want to be either! Great Movie!"
4,"I Do, I Don't.","The War of the Roses is a wickedly entertaning dark comedy starring for the third time, Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. Directed by Danny De Vito who also stars follows the courtship and then marriage of The Roses through the good times and the many bad times. The couple decide to divorce and the bitter twosome become so ruthless that they who do anything to get what they want from the divorce settlement. The ending will leave you breathless, definitely not a cutesy romantic comedy. Enjoy!"
1,i can't stand this film,i'll give the film props on one thing you either Love it or you Loath it.i Loath this film.i find it to be garbage.nothing that i want to ever view again.
5,Must see,"My husband kept talking about this movie and I had never seen it. So I bought it for him for Christmas. Every married couple should see it, especially the ones having trouble. Makes you think twice about what is really important and when it it just time to let go.Was as promised and was shipped promptly."
5,Formidable! (pronounced the French way),"What a fantastic film, although I must take issue with Nnie the Hideous New Girls comment ""what exactly makes War of the Roses so funny yet so bleak? In my opinion it's the same type of entertainment one gets from listening to really nasty juicy gossip"". This opinion is wrong - it is other things which make the film so funny yet so bleak."
4,"Yes, this is (almost) what it's like","It's more a parody than a precise account of how marriages break down, but it's great fun nonetheless. Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner throw their all into their parts - different actors, and it might not have worked as a movie. The best part is probably the first half, as we see the couple accumulate more wealth than is good for them and their kids get too fat and they turn into poseurs with fancy French crystal and a right-hand drive English classic car. Then - bang! She wants a divorce. The movie gradually degenerates into farce, with Douglas pissing into Turner's gourmet cuisine and both of them ending up hanging from a chandelier. Not sure about Danny's part - he comes out looking a bit too cocky for a narrator."
5,Really great,"I loved the movie, it kept me glued to the screen. Romance gone really bad, it's not a ""chick flick"", the guys would love this movie too, I did. The ending was the best for me, complete irony."
4,Splendid!,Never say it's not true to life because it's very close to my divorce. One of the funniest dark comedies I've ever seen (unless you have lived it). I'd give it 5 stars if not for the ending.
2,Okay I guess,"Not as bright as I would have liked for underneath shelf on a bookcase to highlight a fish bowl. Plus, how do you change bulbs without taking it down and ruining the self-adhesive tape?"
1,Poor sound,"I was very disappointed in this. The sound is so muffled, the voices sound like they're impersonators. It's a shame, this could have been so cool"
5,So AWESOME!!! MUST HAVE,This is definately a MUST HAVE item. I dont have one now but it looks soooooooooooooooooooo cool!!! I just have to get one. I've seen alot of other reviews from other STAR WARS lovers and they were very helpful. I just realy hope i get one soon!p.s. STAR WARS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"It's goofy, it's pointless, and I can't stop playing with it","A squawk-box toy with a twist -- it takes the sounds embedded in the Episode 1 figures' 'commtech chip' bases (along with a couple permanently stored in the reader), plays them individually or stores them (4 chips' worth at a time), and can play them at random or have certain figures engage in tiny conversations. Use it while playing with your figures, or carry it with you to torture friends and loved ones. The sound quality is a bit dodgy, but what the heck. Not an essential part of a Star Wars collection, but a surprisingly fun and addictive one. And rumor has it that chips from foreign figures will play on it as well -- though the prospect of Jar Jar speaking French and Spanish is a little alarming. (The instructions are mercifully simple. 9v battery not included.)"
5,A must-have for those collecting Star Wars action figures,"This is a toy that gets more fun as you collect more action figures. With enough figures (and plenty of time on your hands) you can even recreate scenes and convesations from the movie. Most of the sounds are suprisingly high quality. I would say that it's also educational, as kids can learn not to stray to the dark side through these quotes."
3,"Great idea, but could be better","The Comm Tech reader and chips are a great idea. All you have to do is activate the reader, wave a chip over the scanning area, and you hear one of the phrases spoken by the chips' figure. You can even store all of a figures' phrases on the reader, and the reader has room to hold four chips' phrases. You can even scan the chips while they are still in the package, allowing collectors like myself to keep them in the package. Some chips even respond to each other, if one says something,and you play a chip meant to react after it, you will hear the phrase meant for the first chip. Unfortunatly, the poor quality of many of the chips gives this the 'could have been better'. While I was satisfied with Jar-Jar Binks and R2-D2s' sounds, Darth Maul and especially the Battle Droid sounded nothing like the movie characters. And Obi Wan and Qui Gonn could have been anyone that could do a halfway decent impersonation of them."
5,INFO.,"I just wrote the review below yesterday and I have some bad news. I regret to inform everyone that Majahkamo is no longer together. The band has broken up. This came as an upsetting shock to me b/c they were one of the best bands I have ever seen play, and I love their music. Not to mention they put on the best concerts Starr Hill has ever seen. Best of luck to the members of the band and to Justin w/ ""The Calling"". MAJAHKAMO WILL ALWAYS ROCK."
4,This book has left the character of Lindsey in my head!,"I stumbled across this book by Nicole Conn and remembered her from ""Claire of the Moon"", which contained the most passionate and gracefully depicted love scene between two women. ""Passion's Shadow"" did not disppoint! It was well written, kept me up until 2 am reading, and finally, took my breath away. From one artist to another, hats off to you, Ms. Conn!"
3,Solid western where the duke must save is Grandson,"Handy strategy point for kidnappers. If your going to kidnap the grandson of the toughest rancher in the west, make sure that the rumors of his death are true.Richard Boone plays the Bad guy bossman. He is smart tough and bold. But when Jake, family and friends head off to pay the ransome there is adventure and surprises awaiting.The movie is a solid 3 star western. At some point john Wayne must have distacted who his co-stars would be, because this is another movie loaded with his friends that can't act. His son patrick and Robert mitchum son just look out of their element. That aside, I am a hugh fan of Waynes and I'll enjoy most anything he is in, except the COWBOYS."
1,Big Jake,"I recieved the book and sent a good review before I tried to watch it . I never had any problems before, so I thought it would be okay. But when I tried to watch it,It fail to come on, saying I needed a different code. So I wasn't pleased with this transaction. Thank You !"
4,Average movie,"This is about a grandpa, who's in pursuit of his kidnapped Grandson. Along with his 2 sons, and an idian friend, they find him, and kill the villains, (Bruce Cabot). This movie is okay. I didnt like his son that had the motorcycle, because he did a lot of stupid things with it, i hated how the ogar dude killed his dog, and the indian. And that it was 1909. It should have been in the 1800's. But other than that, it was a good movie."
5,My Favorite Western!!!!!!!!!!,"This is The Dukes best movie of all time.I wish i could give it six stars,its that good.The story is excellent.This movie despretly deserves a 2 disk release.Heck,Freddy Vs. Jason got one,why cant Big Jake."
3,Big Jake (DVD),"Movie came in brand new condition, nothing bad on disc and case was mint. Appreciate the e-mail communication, troubled by not receiving another order from the same seller. Keep getting pending e-mails for another DVD that I ordered. Starting to think they didn't have it in stock in the first place."
3,Middling Wayne star vehicle,"When his grandson is kidnapped for ransom, Big Jake McCandles (John Wayne) goes after him with his faithful Indian friend (Bruce Cabot).There are some good character moments, but for the most part this is a by-the-numbers chase film that doesn't manage to work up much suspense. Great veterans like Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Cabot, and Richard Boone share screen time with moderately talented youngsters like Patrick Wayne (John's son), Christopher Mitchum (Robert's boy), and pop star Bobby Vinton."
2,Too Violent,"""Big Jake"" was the worst western John Wayne ever made. There wasway too much violence and the actors that played his sons were not believable.Bruce Cabot was good in the role of an Indian scout but needlessly was killed off right at the end of the movie along with the dog.The dog was probably the best actor in the entire movie but his actions were not beleivable.This was one of John Wayne's Batjac productions and was a total failure just as ""The Alamo"" was.Better to watch ""True Grit"" or ""The Cowboys."""
1,DVD does not work,I recently received the movie Big Jake off of amazon and the movie will not play in the DVD player. It says there is no readable disk in the player?
4,John Wayne,We think this is one of John Wayne's best movies. Excitment and fun all rolled into one. Can't go wrong with any John Wayne movie.
3,Western Escapism With Big John,"One of John Wayne's better late-career vehicles, ""Big Jake"" (1971) is an enjoyable turn-of-the-century Western that mixes humor and gunplay in equal measure. The cinematic icon remains tall in the saddle as Texas rancher Jacob McCandles - taking on villainous Richard Boone and anyone else responsible for the kidnapping of his grandson. Veteran director George Sherman keeps the action moving at a relaxed pace. However, the climactic shootout is bloodier than expected for a Wayne Western. In a disappointingly small role, Maureen O'Hara appears with the Duke for the last time as McCandles' estranged wife."
5,Good movie,"We enjoy John Wayne movies and this was one they seldom show so we bought it. Ironically, it came on tv right after I ordered it. But we got it for the RV anyway so it's all good."
5,Big Jake with John Wayne,"I purchased this movie for a Hospice patient because he said it was his favorite movie. He got to watch the movie one last time before he died. As he was dying, his family put the movie in so he could hear it (hearing is the last sense to go). I never saw the movie myself but I will tell you it must be pretty good!"
4,"NOT THE DUKE'S BEST, BUT TOUGH TO DISLIKE!","This is the only John Wayne movie I was lucky enough to see in the theater. I sat through this film 3 times that day! It is a fun picture and John Wayne was one of those stars who could make any picture work. Seeing it again now, it brought back a lot of good memories, even if it wasn't as good as I remembered. The DVD transfer looks good on my widescreen collection version, but I see there is a newer release. I don't know if they restored or remastered the print on the newer version. Anyone know if they did?"
3,Big Jake,"This is one of those John Wayne movies in which he takes that strong edge with his character at the beginning and never lets up until the final scene. Unlike most of his movies which give him a likeable trait, he carries this tough guy at a high level and never lets down. None of the characters, either friend or foe, can put a dent in his armor. He shows more of an actor ability in this movie than he does in most of his westerns. It is definitely different but I really liked it."
5,JOHN WAYNE AGAIN,"ONCE AGAIN, WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY. ONE OF MY TOP 5 WAYNE MOVIES. I CAN WATCH THIS ONE OVER AND OVER AND NEVER TIRE OF IT."
1,Stinkbomb alert--take cover,"John Wayne was as great as great can be when he was working for the major directors and had a good cast around him. His turkeys were invariably cooked up by his own production company Batjac, and this is one of them. Maybe when he was paying the bills he lost his sense of proportion or movie instincts, it's hard to tell. He certainly should have examined the script more closely: ""Big Jake"" doesn't have a single convincing scene or line of dialogue throughout. Wayne was 62 when it was filmed and as an action hero cuts a preposterous figure, lumbering through stunts he was a dozen years too old to do. At least earlier in ""True Grit"" and later in ""The Shootist"" this infirmity was written into the story; here it's ignored. The supporting cast except for Richard Boone is beneath contempt and even Boone is given some howlers to declaim. He looks positively grateful to be dead in the last scene."
4,Daddy Wayne,"Any fan of John Wayne will definitely want to add this to their collection. Any fan of westerns in general should enjoy it. This brings the West into the 20th Century. Unlike many westerns we see how the automobile, motorcycle, and automatic pistols are bringing about a change in the attitude of how to catch outlaws. Not as much comedy as ""El Dorado"", but still enough humor to keep it from being to dark. Patrick Wayne may never have been a big star but his good looks and performance add to his role here as one of Jake's sons. Chris Mitchum also does fine as one of the sons that has evolved into the clothing and weapons of the time. His acrobatics on a motorcycle are almost reminiscent of ""The Great Escape"". Well worth the price to own it on DVD."
4,Nice pairing of Boone v. Wayne,"Easily Wayne's best pic of the year(he did three!) and story of BigJake McCandles who is trying tosave his kidnapped grandson's lifev. desperado band lead by desperateBoone, who wants ransom. Classic lineat end by dying, mortally woundedBoone, ""Mister - who are you?"" To whichWayne says, ""I'm big Jake McCandles""Boone: ""I heard you were...dead...""(dies), Wayne: 'You heard wrong!'"
4,Excellent Duke and an Excellent DVD.,"Being a Wayne fan, this is definitely one of my favorites. I've been dissapointed by other attempts to do DVD's of John Wayne movies, but this is not one of those. CBS DVD did a spectacular job on the transfer. If only they would get rights to McLintock and do it justice I'd be happy. This gets 4 stars only for a lack of extras. If you want a nice, clean copy of Big Jake, enhanced for widescreen, COME AND GET IT!"
3,want of workmanship,I have used the fence for over two years and found the fence wanting for acuracy and useability. The lock levers which secures the fence are poorly made and hard to use. The lock lever plastic gears are stripped and require replacement. The cost for a replacement is over $7. I would spend my money on something else.Delta Deluxe Shaper Fence(Model 43-812)
5,Bad Packaging and Amazon,Item was packaged bad and was broken in two and now I am wondering why Amazon charged me twice and wont even return a damn email. I think its time to go back to buying local
4,Classic Swords and Sandals!,"This epic does, as a critic once said, go on and on. But I like it to go on and on for the most part. Besides the spare-no-expense spectacle, the best part of the movie are some of the excellent supporting cast. Rex Harrison, Marting Landau, Roddy McDowell and others do a great job of keeping the movie interesting. The weakest is Richard Burton. He played Antony as a drunk, which may have been true in his later years but it makes for a boring, sloppy, unlikeable character. Its a great movie in its own unique way, but be prepared for a long night."
5,Spectacular Epic!,What a stellar classic! How can you go wrong w/ Liz Taylor and Richard Burton? The music and scenery tops it all off.
1,I Can't Believe I Saw the Whole Thing!,"The only part of the 3-DVD set (Cleopatra-Five Star Edition) worth watching is the two-hour documentary, ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood."" Seeing the documentary on AMC is what led me to the regrettable decision to purchase the DVD set. Maybe it was watching ""Julius Caesar"" with James Mason, John Gielgud, and Marlon Brando the night before and ""Citizen Kane"" the night before that, but by comparison, the Taylor-Harrison-Burton ""Cleopatra"" is so bad that it's almost (but not quite) camp like the original TV ""Batman"" series. The script is pompous and incoherent, the sets are patently phony, the action scenes are pathetically inept and unbelievable, and resolution quality of the DVD release is quite inferior. If you must see this monstrosity, rent it because one viewing will be more than enough."
4,Cleopatra - Five Star Collection?,"I am a big fan of all Elizabeth Taylor works, especially Cleopatra. But with all of the extras on the DVD, where is Liz? The lack of Liz in the DVD extras really disappointed me. Otherwise, I am very glad to own this DVD - I watched it all right away. The color and sound is a big improvement over my VHS copy and I really enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette. I was a little miffed that I had to change discs at intermission, but I suppose it was always a good place for a break. For the all it's minor disappointments, Cleopatra is still the most bang for the buck that I've seen to date on DVD. If you include all the extras, it breaks down to about $3USD/per hour of top notch Hollywood golden-era entertainment. If you're on the fence, don't hesitate - get it!"
4,Whoa!,"It's a classic; what can I say? Liz Taylor dominates the screen. I saw this in the 60's when I was 8 and didn't remember much. Seeing it now, I'm amazed at how racy it was; and would still be a little racy for network TV. Liz repeatedly bares as much as she can without showing the goods and they've even got a dancing girl who's braless, wearing pasties shaking what her momma gave her. This film must have pushed the envelope back in '63. But that aside, Taylor's acting, coupled with the natural heat between her and multiple-time husband Richard Burton make it entertaining. It's not a great movie, but there was too much talent for it to be a flop. If you're building a library of classic cinema, this should be in it."
3,A Classical Epic,"Although this movie did not receive rave reviews when it was in the theaters, for any collector of classic movies, I think this is a must have. The story is not historic fact & the acting leaves a bit to be desired, but the sets & specticles make it a good addition to any collection."
2,Movie is in German Language NOT English,Order fulfillment was just fine as well as shipping times. Only complaint I have is that the movie is in German! Maybe it is something I missed when ordering although I have since re-read the order and saw nothing about it being in German - only that it shipped from Germany. It is useless to me
5,Truly a classic,The pagentry and beauty of this movie never fail to entertain. I love looking at the chemistry between Elizabeth Taylor and the two men in her life.
4,Cleopatra,Excellent movie. An epic from the 1960's. Extremely well done in its time and full of big name actors of the era
5,Spectacular!,"I highly recommend watching this beautifully remastered movie. I can't wait to watch it on Blu-Ray. You'll love the scenery, the costumes - especially Cleopatra's, all gorgeous, beautiful designs - very eye catching. Elizabeth Taylor (Cleopatra) was very sexy, sensual and intelligent. For those of you who love watching classic movies, you'll love watching this one."
5,A classic,"This movie is a classic movie and one of my all time favorites. You can't go wrong with Elizabeth Taylor playing the role of a sensual, sexy and smart Cleopatra mixed with sexy Richard Burton and you have a great movie. You can feel the heat from the screen with the two of them."
4,A classic epic,"This version of Cleopatra is great eye candy. The costumes, sets, and total production are breathtaking, especially considering everything was done without computers. This set has excellent restored visual quality, so the sharpness of image leaves nothing to be desired.Though the performances are good enough, I think modern day versions of this ageless story are better, like in HBO's Rome.In any event a great epic that is enjoyable to watch again and again."
4,Leave it to Hollywood,"There's something about Hollywood always leaving gaps in films that deal with history.""Cleopatra"" did have great dialogue and one can't deny the great cast: Liz Taylor, Rex Harrison, Richard Burton. However, more lavish were the costume changes and the sets, it added color to such a historic and epic story.Some of the story ofcourse is changed to fit it into Hollywood standards. I enjoyed the film particularly that it offered a visual into the lives of history's most controversial figures.There's nothing to truly argue about but the whole issue of Hollywood re-writing history in a film does bug me as most of the time they will change the whole story around."
4,A great big soap opera,I really like this film when you have some time on your hands. I frankly think its the last of the really big movies put out by the studios before they went under. The scale and expense of this film is just mind boggling! That and I think Rex Harrison really got into the spirit of what Julius Caesar must of been like. It is also obvious that the fire between Mr. Burton and Ms Taylor was real.
3,It's all about Liz,A four hour showcase for Elizabeth Taylor's breasts with cool sets and lots and lots of extras in the background.
1,Merri's Words,"The movie, Cleaopatra, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, is worth seeing, but, if possible, you should buy it second hand. That may sound like a half-hearted recommendation, and that is exactly what it is.It is worth it to see the sets and costumes and Miss Taylor is stunningly beautiful. However, the dialogue and pace of the movie will put most audiences to sleep!I also suspect that any resemblance to reality is purely accidental. Seeing Carol O'Connor (aka Archie Bunker) as a Roman soldier, for example, is quite jarring."
1,Awesomely Bad,"Despite the lavish sets and really good acting from Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, Martin Landau (was he ever so young????), and many others, this is a wretched film.Its wretchedness stems entirely from Liz Taylor.She manages an astonishing feat. She simultaneously overacts and is wooden.I don't know how she achieves such opposite things. She is breathtakingly bad, thrillingly terrible, awesomely awful.Apparently she was raised on a different planet, and then plunked down on the set. She has no idea what a human acts like, or what a real emotion is.This explains Michael Jackson's fascination with her: birds (?) of a feather.In a grotesque way, she is fun to watch, if you like watching bloody and terrible car wrecks over and over.Just ghastly. She would have to improve (A LOT) to suck.There aren't adjectives enough in the thesaurus to say how vomitrocious her performance (?) is."
3,dvd Review,"I can't help but say that I was let down by this release. Don't get me wrong, the dvd's themselves are very attractive and for the fact that it is a 3 dvd set the price is exceptional. It was the movie itself that disapointed me. It was lacking a major land battle scene which for the price to make this movie there should have been one. We have some of the greatest military minds of all time and it seems like a waste of 4+ hours not to have at least a small battle. There was also no super scene that all great movies have. (Ben Hur has many, Gladiator had it's opening battle just to name a few.) If you are a past fan of this movie then go ahead and buy it. If you plan on buying based on adverising hype or word of mouth rent it first."
5,movie rental,We were going on a long drive and I watched the movie while my husband drove. It was an awesome thing to get to see a movie while riding along.
3,"So So transfer, but fantastic extras","I am not sure I want to see the six hour Cleopatra, but I enjoyed this film a lot more than Gladiator. It is a shame the transfer isn't as pristine as Universal's superb series of Hitchcock DVDs, but the 2 hour documentary on Cleopatra's torturous production history and newsreel footage on disc 3 make up for the erratic transfer. Both film and extras brought back childhood memories of my first trips to the movies in the sixties. As Dylan recently sang in The Wonder Boys, things have changed."
1,arrived in Italian,Really? This is what I don't like about products coming from other vendors. The movie was in Italian and wouldn't even play on my DVD player. It would have cost more to send it back to the vendor than the price of the DVD.
2,BORING!!!!!!!!,"I Studied Cleopatra for my history class and i recently saw this Movie. While it was pretty accurate historically, i thought that it completly failed to bring Cleopatra to life. Rex harrison was pretty good as Caesar, and Burton was ok as Antony, but Taylor was terrible as Cleopatra! Also, the movie should have been called Caesar and Mark Antony and how Cleopatra affected them. Also, Cleopatra was ugly, why can't people accept this?"
3,GREAT Epic!!! 21/2 Thumbs Up!!! Dissapointing Actress!!!!,"Elizabeth Taylor (Booo!!!), Oscar nominee Richard Burton (The Robe), Academy-Award winner Sir Rex Harrison (My Fair Lady)and the incomparable Martin Landau star in the classic tale oif history's most bewitching Queen. Elizabeth Taylor is dissapointing however, even though she gave it her best shot. The costumes were terrific. I appreciate all the hard work that went into making this movie. Richard Burton, Sir Rex Harrison and Martin Landau did excellent work Richard Burton should have won the Academy Award for best actor. Where did Taylor come from? The special features were terrific."
4,Cleopatra not Shakespeare,"The film is a true spectacle. More beautiful than beautifully acted, in my opinion. Elizabeth Taylor gives a modern day twist to the character of Cleopatra, with her sly winks and smiles, she seems to be more down to earth and blatatantly flirty than one would expect a monarch to be. The sets are fantastic, also the acting of the two male leads. I had hoped that this film would follow the Shakespeare play, Antony and Cleopatra, but it is nothing like the play."
4,Good,This is a great movie on the whole. It is beautifully set and filmed and is a very glamourous movie. However the development of the characters is poor- Antony was obviously meant to be a great and habdsome leader but came across as a total nutter!(I know he went mad during the end but the film shows him being crazy all the way through). Also Cleopatra wasn't in it nearly enough to make the filmed named after her. Apart from those points this film is worth seeing.
2,Liz Taylor is NO Oscar winner for this film!,"Liz Taylor did not win an Oscsar for this film - she won for Butterfield 8 and Virginia Wolfe. If it were not for Rex Harrison, I would not have made it through the first half. Bad and Boring."
4,WOW!!,"This movie keeps' getting a bad wrap, but for what? True it is a bit long but the sets, the scenery...AMAZING!! Hollywood couldn't make a movie like this today without a computer...think about it, these sets were built!! I'm just waiting for it to be released on DVD!"
5,Cleopatra!!!!! Oscar Winner,There are 2 DVDs for this large and awesome movie. I really recommend. Good movie.
5,Shine On Me!!!!,"GREAT DEBUT , PRODUCED BY MIKE BROOKS, FT LISA PAGE, KAREN CLARK SHEARD, J.MOSS, LAEH PAGE AND MANY OTHERS , THIS SONG HELPED ME THROUGH A VERY HARD TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS REALLY GOING THROUGH , LISA PAGE-BROOKS IS LEADING THE VAMP"
2,Promising but not really satisfactory,"I read the book in a new and good Dutch translation, that tries to render Gadda's use of dialects. The book has an interesting beginning and seems to be a detective work, but then Gadda looses himself in endless descriptions and the crimes are not solved at all. In the end the reader is left with a unsatisfactory feeling."
5,Love piano of Russ Conway,"One of my favorite pianists along with Beegie Adair, Charlie Shafer and Enrique Chia. Just wonderful. Try them all. Purchased at Amazon"
5,A great book for beginner and on.,"Happy Traum's Bluegrass Guitar book is an excellent resource, whether you're a beginner or an advanced player. I've played mostly folk guitar for 12 years and this book helped me swing into bluegrass. It starts with a brief but clear and complete introduction to chords and picking, gets you through some basic runs and then right into the songs themselves. The book is full of fun old songs and even has some newer (for 1974!) bluegrass styles in a section in the back. Each song has the melody line written in standard music notation as well as the guitar version below in tablature. My book is falling apart I use it so often. It's by far the best book I've found for bluegrass guitar!"
3,irritating mistakes,"Page 20 gives pick directions,then on page 21 these are immediately ignored; also the direction of stroke is then reversed; ideal for a learner I don't think. The conventional pick directions on page 20 are by far the clearer.Page 116 starts the song 'Sittin on top of the world' and then runs out of words at the bottom of the page.Where is the rest of it? The term short measure comes to mind!Wonder what Amazon intent to do about it?"
3,does the trick,"pretty straight forward book, i would advise having at least some experience prior to getting this book. it has beginner stuff in it and some good instruction and history in it. LOTS of songs too! I got a good laugh out of the listening instruction aid: not a cd like i expected but a no kidding record! all in all not bad, just make sure you have patience just like any other instructional book"
2,Not all that great,The CD seems to be an after thought and doesn't really match the book all that well. The book is very thin on technique and skill building which is the reason one would buy the book
2,dangerous pity,lloyd a. simandl directed this not so action packed film starring shannon whirry and ciara hunter. you got two very sexy actresses but not alot of action. robin kane(whirry) is a women who gets trapped in an institute that trains assassins.once her trainng begins she descovers that some of her fellow trainees are being murdered by the heads of the institute using a computer generated torture device. robin then befriends one of the trainees(hunter) and the two of them attempt to escape. this movie is really only good for drooling over whirry and hunter(who was miss canada in 1988 and made her starring debut here). the movie lacks both excitement and suspense. if you really want to see it then id say rent it or borrow it.
3,Use Care When Washing,"I thought these were great glasses until I broke two of them just by washing them. The shape, feel and look of the glasses are great for which I could give five stars. They are a bit delicate though, since the slightest increase in pressure while washing them can crack them."
2,Beautiful,"But way too fragile. These glasses have been broken while being hand washed. The few remaining now are relegated to the back of the cabinet and labeled 'the good ones'. For the money, try something a bit thicker at the rim, hopefully the'll be less fragile. (Or just go to the dollar store, and care a bit less if one gets dropped.)"
4,Spiegelau's family resemblance to Riedel,"The Spiegelau Authentis series is expanding into more varietal specific glass shapes. The Bordeaux glasses share a number of similarities with the Riedel Vinum line's Bordeaux glasses, but with a slightly heavier, thicker glass than Vinum, but at a much lower cost. Overall, a glass that shows off the cabernet / Bordeaux aromas well."
