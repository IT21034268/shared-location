3,Decent Value,Good basic analog / digital watch. One early issue - Band became detached from one end of watch for no real reason. Has been OK since. Time will tell.
3,Warning on the alarms,"It has three alarms but 1 is the ""snooze alarm"" and you cannot stop it from beeping every so often unless you completely disable it. Thus if you don't turn it back on for the next day it will not be armed. So you really have 2 alarm pre-sets that are day to day automatic. I needed all three when I bought the watch and likely would have made a different decision had I known. The velcro-cloth band is a nice addition."
5,Great Watch,"I bought this for my 13-year-old son. He has a small wrist, but I'm sure he will be growing. This fully velcroed band is perfect! The directions are written very small, and are thus difficult to read, but I was able to figure it out and set this watch. He loves that it tells time in different zones, though you have to push a button to get to this feature. He would have liked to have the European time zone displayed continually. You can only display the day and date or the digital time continually. This watch also has a timer and can store phone numbers."
5,Great lookin watch,"Had the watch's band replaced with leather immediately due to personal preference. The watch's color is very subtle, and I am a big fan of the date screen. Don't like watches with the adjuster bulging out the side, and this watch solves that problem. Been submerge in a pool and while washing dishes, no leaks. Hands glow for around 3min after direct light. Case can scratch a little easy, but just a minor flaw. Suggest this watch to anyone."
5,Great!,This cheap watch looks really cool and it looks not like its price. It can be priced above $30. Im happy to get this one.
2,i had so many high hopes for this watch,I almost wanted to buy one for myself but this watch although stylish isnt durable at all and all thats left now is the watch with no band. the nylon is tough but the leather that connects directly to the watch wasnt strong at all and came a part from the watch very soon after the gift was given. the indiglo on it was nice but thewatch heldup poorly
4,good basic watch,"Good basic watch has analog and digital display,ten year battery,waterproof,choice of bands and color,comfortable size. what else do you need."
4,such a nice watch,"such a nice watch ,very light in the rest and have alot of options rly more than great but it's very complex. it's impossible for anyone who hadnt read the manual to do in thing. u have just to read the manual carefully be4 using it."
3,Not as advertised.,"I just received this watch from Amazon.com and must respond. I fell for the Amazon description for the second time as regards inexpensive Casio watches. Out of the box 1) the case and bezel are NOT stainless steel (it is some sort of resin); 2) the crystal is NOT mineral (it is a very soft acrylic; and 3) the band is NOT canvas (it is nylon, probably an improvement).Disappointed as I am I'll keep the watch, that is unless the crystal gets too scratched up in a short period of time.UPDATE: My worst fears were confirmed; in three months the (soft plastic) crystal was scratched. Worse than that, however, is that the (soft plastic) case cracked! I notified amazon.com but they referred me to Casio. I emailed their support group bu they have not responded.I now have a very nice Citizen watch. Yes, it cost more, but ..."
2,review of Casio AW80V-5BV,"Nice looking watch, but.....Setting the analog and digital time is hard and confusingso far, the analog time has gained 2 minutesnot recommended"
3,Hard to set functions,"I like the display. But, setting the functions is not intuitive at all - even reading the instructions. I bought it because of the large display and multiple time zone capability. Display is fine. Setting and time zone use, not so much."
2,Low light an issue,"This watch is perfectly functional but for one major flaw - the light. This is not an ""indiglo"" style light up watch, rather it has a small light that shines from the side, which I found completely inadequate."
3,Casio Men's watch,This was a nice watch but too complicated for me.....I wanted a simple watch to use in my shop. It isn't the watch's.... problem....I returned it for another.
2,Too low end,"Looks less attractive after you've received it than in the picture, feels cheapouter dial distorts viewing the watch face, hands and numbers also."
3,Isn't really practical.,"The best thing I can say about this watch is that the wrist band is really good. The velcro idea makes it real easy to adjust and gives a secure fit. But if you neeed to read the time on a dark night you better carry a flashlight. Yeah, I know there's a push button light switch. However the lights are ineffective in lighting the watch face. I'll bet it's draining that longlife battery pretty quick as well. Save your money."
2,Too complicated,"With so many buttons and ""modes,"" I still haven't figured out how to set the time on the damn thing."
1,I never got this book! Never ever. Don't order from this seller.,"The subject line basically says it all. I never received this book. Now I am going to have to go through the hassle to get my money back. Also, because I waited so long to receive it, I ended up having to go the bookstore to get it so I could get my reading done, but by that point they only had NEW books, so I had to spend a bundle. This seller is not good and you should not buy from them! I would give them 0 stars, but Amazon won't let me!"
2,"Good bits, bad case","It is very difficult to put the bits back into DW2513 case due to a design mistake, which is frustrating, and the chuck is loose and doesn't have a holder.The bits are otherwise okay and the case is Dewalt standard.This part is on clearance. Anything more than ten dollars would be too much."
5,I LUV THIS,This movie and soundtrack is the greatest!! I recommend them both to everyone. All the songs are great and just every little detail of the movie is superb. But I feel sorry for Meatloaf!
5,Holding up nicely,"36 years since the film's release, and all the midnight madness that goes along. I had my star turn in the early 80s and loved every second of it. When my daughter was small, """"The Time Warp"""" scared her to tears. That's not a happy memory, but it is indicative of this music's power over young and old. Every song a winner, performed in character, editing is purrrfect, musicians are superb . . .if you don't like the movie, the soundtrack won't make much sense, but is definitely worth a listen."
4,Time Warp,"Can't get this in the stores anymore. Brings back memories of fish net stockings, wieners and yelling at a big screen."
4,Good condition,I received this CD in a timely manner and it was in good shape with no scrathes on the CD.
4,Almost perfect.,"I've been a die hard Rocky fan for years. I've taken part in many a midnight showing and I've only just now bought an ""offical"" soundtrack (many a burned copy has passed through these hands) to the film. Not a negative word has passed my lips except for the absence of one key song. ""The Sword of Damoclese"" is not on this album. Bummer as this is one rockin' song and I had to resort to piracy to complete my perfect soundtrack. Other than that...Fantastic. That's enough of the downers for me. Rock on!!!"
5,EXCELLENT!,The Rocky Horror Picture Show is my favorite movie and this soundtrack just plain ROCKS!Need I say more?
4,Extreme Guilty Pleasure,"I first saw RHPS when I was six years old, back when the 15th anniversary VHS came out. The majority of the film went over my head, but the music always stuck with me.Of course, it isn't the greatest music ever made. But, it's fun."
2,review of RHPS soundtrack,"Bless my soul, there's no ""Sword of Damoclese"" on the album. That's the start of a pretty big downer."
1,Master and Margarita and Rocky Horror Picture Show,"I don't know about you.But this story is just too weird.Is it just a coincidence?If you read the Russian Master and Margarita, one would pose a question, why isn't there a movie or show made based on a story.Well are't all the characters already present in Rocky Horror Picture Show from Master and Margarita.You've got your foreigner Satan Voland - Tim Curry(who is a positive character in the book) and Koroviev - the Butler, Richard O'Brien, Margarita -Susan Sarandon, professor Berlioz - the guy in the wheelchair.Man, this is just somebody who really adored the book who wrote the script for Rocky Horror Picture Show.Check out Master and Margarita, you won't regret it."
4,Great songs.,"This soudtrack is great.You don,t have to have seen the movie to enjoy the music on this CD.There is only one problem,this sountrack doesn't include 2 of the songs from the movie,but it is still a great CD!"
5,a couple of numbers from leon,"here's leon russell pretending he's Hank Williams, better then Hank Williams Junior will ever be able to. This is such a great CD you will love it from the first time you listen to it. a true labor of love."
4,A country journey,"I cant say that I liked or disliked country music as I'd never listened to it, then along came 'Hank' - and I listened. 30 years on and I'm still listenin. This is without doubt the album most responsible for turnin ordinary rock lovin souls onto country music. So befor you say ""I dont like country"" (or even after you've said it) have a listen to Hank Wilsons Back, befor you realize what you're doin - you'll be havin a hoe down y'all.Add it to your collection, you wont be sorry!"
5,All Time Great Country,"I bought this LP when it came out, I believe in 1973, so when I found it on cd, I just had to have it. The delivery was quick and packaged good. This collection is of some the best country songs ever written, if you like the real country music then check this out, you will not be dissapointed. Leon Russell did a great job and used the best musicians for this project."
5,"Huge fan, love the selection, and Leon is spot on in his renditions","I listened to this when it first came out, years ago. I saw Leon in a documentary with Elton John recently, the making of their album The Union. I recalled this album.There are a couple remixes. I love his rendition of She Thinks I Still Care.If you like Leon, and don't have this, a must buy."
1,Bad tape...,This tape was defective on the B side and wasn't legible and it was a sorry product for Amazon to sell.
5,The Green Planetary Legends,"One of the best and unusual books that I've read regarding the legend, lore and spirituality of plants. The book gives the biological names as well as the latin names, plus the street names of the plants as well as their genetic makeup. But the fun part is the reading of the indigenous uses of the plants and their links to religions, faiths and practices such as catholicism, voodum, santeria and also to tribal yoruba, and ife spiritual practices. You will become aware of cosmic plants such as the indian hemp that has be proven to predict the weather...the red hot poker plant that is able to select the criminal element of the community, the taheeboo which is reportedly a cure for leukemia and the iboga that helps you to reach your other demensional ancestors. If you love plants and respect plants this is one for your library."
1,this book is dull and i find no meaning in it,I found this book to be on the hrrid side of dulls ville thus creating a sense of weary transition of anger and shear pain to think i spent five hours reading it .
3,new age,"the more I read this book, the more I realized that I was reading a book that gives more credence and power to angels than to God who created angels. I didn't finish reading it."
3,didn't like the scent,"i have a versace man cologne and i like that nice fresh smell. realities is the opposite of that, not to mention it is quite strong. for the money i guess it's not bad. it kinda smells like a very strong woman's perfume so it's pretty much a decoration on my sink now lol."
5,love this stuff,This is currently my favorite everyday cologne. Nice clean smell. I get a lot of compliments on realities. Definitely worth the price.
1,Smells like Off bug repellent,This cologne has a very weird smell similar to Off! insect repellent or those citronella candles. It smells more like women's perfume than men's cologne. I bought it because of the price and the reviews on here. Just pass on it if you are thinking about buying it.
5,Sweet Smelling & very good,"I bought this just trying something new, and it surprised me how good it smells once you put it on...and this site has the best price i have seen for any cologne. But even if you don't like it....but you like women BUY IT!! you'll hear good comments all day. all around good."
4,CITRUS AND WOOD NOTES ADD TO THIS SCENT,"Liz Claiborne's latest fragrance for men, Realities, is an outdoors fresh, clean scent. The blend of citrus and wood notes is ultra masculine, while a certain richness is added by Italian Grapefruit, and Mandarin. Then with a touch of Nutmeg, Ginger and Teas there is also a hint of spiciness.It's attractive and memorable without being at all overpowering.The heavy glass bottle is broad shouldered with a gun metal silver cap with a double band of olive - good looking.Realities is available in the 3.4 oz. and 1.7 oz. Cologne spray as well as in After Shave, After Shave Soother, Hair & Body Wash, and Deodorant."
5,Buy it,"No reveiw needed, get it, how many colognes can you find of this quality for this price, just buy it, I purchased a bottle of it already and if you wont get it someone else will"
1,BEWARE!!!,This product is a 1 litre bottle for the same price as a gallon. They deliberately picture a one gallon (4 litre) size and ship a 1 litre bottle.Check other places you can get a one litre bottle for around $22 - $29.
4,Always good stuff,"Another wonderful Philosophy product. This company knows what's good but their prices reflect it. Wish they'd make things a bit more affordable so we could own alot more. They are just ""good stuff""."
3,NOTHING NEW BUT NOT SO BAD,"DEEP EVIL offers little novelty in the genetic experiment gone horribly awry genre, but it's decently made and generates a few chills. The movie opens with a doctor escaping from a mysterious lab and accused of being a terrorist. We find out that this secret lab has enforced a lockdown, snaring 14 of its staff for some unknown reasons. We find out too that the lab had cloned an alien organism which if set loose would destroy mankind as we know it. Enter the beautiful doctor, the gallant special ops force and a creepy monster that makes drops of water seem terrifying. Lorenzo Lamas, Ona Greuner, Thomas Scott, Will Sanderson and Adam Morrison do okay in the lead roles and the effects (most of the time) are above average. It has a twist ending that smells of sequelitis? Not bad for a b flick."
2,Deep cheap evil,"The scary title of this movie makes a lot of promises, but sadly when the evil itself is revealed, you will be filled with disappointment. The special effects that are being used already look medieval these days and the aliens are hardly scary.This movie is a sad attempt to combine some of the great stuff from other movies.(SARR)"
2,"WOW, What a great movie??","I was'nt going to write a review but the only review here was written by a member of the Lorenzo Lamas fan club. He is'nt even the star of this film (Wow, Lorenzo's career is tanking fast)The production values are bad.The acting is mediocre.BUT..the plot is OK.Deep Evil is not a terrible film, but it is not that good either. Don't pay too much for it."
3,Cheesy but fun sci-fi...,"If you like the Sci-fi movies... then this works... entertaining, kinda funny, some very poor special effects at the end make it enjoyable... :)"
4,"Good common sense, but a little tedious in parts.","I found this book to be full of good, common sense on how to get your life (both financial and non-financial aspects) in order by taking a value added approach. Very comforting to the reader. Some points, however, seemed to go on forever (probably because the author was trying to drive them home), so the book was a little tedious in parts. (I would say to myself, ""Enough already!"") Still a good read, just jump ahead when you get bored (you've probably gotten the point)."
4,What TV themes?,"I don't like dance, i don't like compilations but i love this CD. A fantastic compilation showcasing an iota of what the Australian dance scene has to offer. This CD converted me two years back from Guitars to dance.I bought it for the Fatt Dexx song with Trey. That's probably one of the weakest songs come to think of it, but a nice way to pull me into the album.After two years i still listen to, enjoy and nuture this CD. At first i listened to the whole thing and it was as smooth and flowing as any album, then the songs by themselves stood out. I realized that this CD was great and ever since it's always on my pile of CD's. The songs cover most of what you'd want to hear at a club.This is a dance compilation, not chill out, not hardcore dance either. It's has a great balance of soft and hard music. Great to put on when you've got some energy and your just about to go out and you need to get hyped.Oh and the TV Themes thing is just a gimick."
4,Dr. Revenue has the cure.,">I read almost the whole book in one weekend! We have already started planning to do the workshop. I have read many marketing books in the past, including having written a video script for Jay Conrad Levinson, but none of them walk you through the process like Dr. Revenue does. It really is interactive and has taught me as much this weekend what I need to get done as any work I have done in the past 6 months."
2,Game is a care bears pong,This game is a little too simple and did not hold the attention of my 4 year old daughter. The games are like pong and tetris and not interactive with the care bears at all.
5,Wonderful fandango,"The performance of Soler's masterpiece 'Fandango' by Rafael Puyana is, simply, outstanding. You can listen to it again and again and each time you will do it, you'll find something you didn't notice before."
5,Easy to sing along with and not torture.,Many kids music CD's lead to crazy parents. This one is actually fun to listen and sing along with. I have found myself singing some of the songs when doing chores around the house! We have had this for almost 3 years now. Great for singing and putting songs to daily activities.
4,Don't miss this one!,"Being an avid Pat Metheny fan, I own all the DVD's, CD's, MC'c and LP's available from this fantastic guitarist/composer.Now I can't say that this particular DVD portrays the best of Pat, but the selection of songs on this particular DVD is a very nice example of what he can do. Initially I thought this DVD too expensive, but let me tell you, it is well worth it!Just the way he plays the song ""How Insensitive"" would be worth the price.From a artistic point of view, this DVD is as straightforward as can be, but hey...."
4,Buy a Region 0 Version DVD for American Fans,"Be aware that this Region 2 version will not play on most North American DVD players. I bought a Region 0 DVD(which has no regional coding) from a British company called DVD4Music.com for $35 or 24 British Pounds. The DVD I bought is also NTSC compatible for North American televisions.Now, the picture quality looks like it was put on DVD in the early days w/o much enhancement or effort. It's not much better than the PQ of the Laserdisc version....BUT...if you're a die-hard fan of Pat Metheny and in love with his Secret Story effort, then this is your only chance to own anything from that era."
5,"Love this Album, Love this Concert","If you love ""secret Story"" you will love this DVD. Watched it 50 times by now. Great performance. Not as polished production as The Way Up, but still worth it."
4,attractive presentation of basics,"I'm not a designer. But recently having read Chip Kidd's ""The Cheese Monkeys,"" about graphic design students, I developed a layman's interest and came across The Nature of Design. It does an excellent job of presenting the key elements and principles of design (graphic, industrial, landscape, etc.)in a format that's easy to read, well illustrated, and takes its examples from a variety of design fields. For the general reader or a novice (or would be) design student, this is a great place to start. Highly recommended!"
5,"Step by Step "" A Proven Success""","Step by Step is an outstanding book that provides great tips for students, employees, auditors,investigators and project managers who are starting large projects or dissertations. The methods used are helpful in managing time and keeping the project organized and focused. The step by step method stimulates the desire to take steps toward completing task. The tasks become fun and challenging as one advances toward completion with less anxiety.I highly recommend this book! It is a great way to stay organized, beat deadlines, manage large projects and complete award winning research papers.Ammy Jones,MPA"
3,confused,"I ordered this book believing it is the 2nd edition. It even has the ISBN of the 2nd Edition, but when I open the book, the first page, which is in black and white, says 3rd edition. I am very confused and do not know if this is the book I need or not, and cannot seem to find out. Nobody seems to know. I have not used the book yet, so I cannot rate the book, only the way that it is very confusing to figure out which edition you have."
4,Bore brush,"Great product, strong enough to last and take out all the residue without scratching up your barrel."
1,cheap cheap cheap,"I too thought this would make a good dvd rack. Half-way through the H's in my alphabatiation of our collection the side bowed out and everything came crashing down.Do yourself a big favor, buy something a lot better and sturdier."
1,Absolute garbage,"Fell apart almost instantly. Can barely support it's own weight, let alone the CDs/DVDs that it was supposed to hold.Avoid this thing like the plague."
1,Crappy shelves,"The shelves fell down every time I put a new DVD in the rack, and sometimes when I took one out. The knobs that hold the shelves up are flimsy and far too small, to say the least. Very poorly made, do not buy!!"
1,Carboard will hold dvd's better...,"This dvd shelf is absolute garbage. I wouldn't even use it if someone gave it to me for free. The shelf is extremely flimsy and the little metal pegs are useless (agreed with another reviewer). My dvd's have all fallen off on more than 1 occasion. This is the worst dvd shelf I have ever used. Atlantic is a crappy brand anyways. You can find cheap, very sturdy multimedia shelves but you gotta know where to look. That's why reviewers like us are here to help. Avoid this shelf at all costs!"
2,CHEAP!!!!!!!!!,i saw this tout it make a good dvd rack n for cheap. the wood when esembling was cracked n broken it could not be put together by the screws so i glued the whole thing. its wobly it shuffles n dosent hold even close to 128 dvds u get 4 dvd shelves of space. i guess this rack is for cds cause it comes with 6 shelves. n you might as well buy ur own shelv pegs cause the screws n pegs are alll over the box n mine must have fell out. all n alll cheap!!!!!!! poor woood quality n poor shipping quality. too bad cause it has a nice look n collor.
3,Banged up Box,Great price on the product. Shipped really fast but the box looked as though it went through a war. One of the corners were broken right out of the box and the black marker fixed the other nicks. I am sure if I had contacted the company they wold have replaced but I was too excited about putting it together. I would buy another one.
4,Does the Job,"I found this product while I was searching for a dvd storage unit. Each one of these will hold 100+ dvds for sure (depending on how many tv collections or other boxed sets you may have).I bought two and have had no problems with them. They were easy to set up; and while they look cheap, they do the job. You cannot really expect more from a $35 product. The best part about them, is that the shelves are customizable. Say you want to store DVDs and CDs together; the shelves can be positioned to hold the max quantity of whatever you need it for. I have had no shelves fall down and no problems with their construction. They will also be easy to take apart if you want to store them or pack them to move. Also, it must be said that the backing of this is made out of very thin cardboard material so don't attempt to move it while there are dvds on the shelves or there could be a big mess."
3,Good for the money I suppose,"Ok, so compare to other shelving units, this one was a third of the price. Also a third of the quality. It does the job, but if you have children, I do not recommend it. It's a little wabbley and not too sturdy. It looks nice though and beats what we were using before... boxes!!"
2,Not worth it,This is horrible quality. It buckles under the weight of anything and it isn't very fashionable either.
2,Lost pieces,The shelf itself was really nice. but there were no directions for assembly and it had many missing hardware peces that iha t og oto the store and pick up mysef. i told them and i was suposed to get a refund and i never got the refund.
2,"Flimsy, poor quality/material","I wasn't very impressed with this flismy, non-sturdy DVD/CD storage unit.The material is very cheap.I'd invest more money in getting something more substantial & don't waste your money on this item."
3,Bad advertisement,"I am not totally happy about this purchase. I trust the picture shown and didn't measure the sizes (height and length). So it was my fault no to check it before making the purchase. I thought it was bigger and broader, so I couldn't imagine that all my CDs, books and DVDs wouldn't fit in it, so I will probably have to buy other cabinet (a bookcase, actually). I just chose this instead of other I saw in other company (IKEA, I think) because the shipping was easier and cheaper and the price overall was better than the other one. But if you only wanna store your CDs in an organized manner and you have less than 200, go ahead..."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this at Best Buy and I will be returning it today. I set everything up like it said, I put my dvds in... and then the whole thing fell apart. Of course this was after I alphabetized everything. I have built a ton of stuff, mostly from Ikea, so I'm not a complete idiot. This is not worth the money."
1,Horrible Quality and Construction,"Buyer beware! I usually don't review items, but this one was so bad that I couldn't help but want to warn anyone who is thinking of purchasing it! The quality and construction of this unit is horrible. The screws did not even stay in the fake wood. (I knew this wasn't solid wood, but usually, screws will take). After putting it ""together"", it LITERALLY fell apart as soon as I picked it up to move it to the spot where it was going. The back panel came in broken and the shelves were rough. Also...the unit does not hold as many DVD's as advertised...at least not in an upright position. The shelves aren't evenly distributed so the last shelf holds the DVD's laying down. Overall....this product is not worth the already cheap price! It's truly a case of ""you get what you pay for!"". I returned mine and got a really nice piece from Target for a few bucks more!!"
3,You get what you pay for,"For the price the product is OK, but, before anything is put on it after assembly, be prepared to attach, with screws, at least the two middle shelves to the sides, or the unit will spread causing the shelves to fall.This is what happened to me-after I had packed the unit with CDs and DVDs, unfortunately."
1,Waste of money,"Purchased at a local big box for around $40. It went together quickly, but fell apart the moment I put DVDs on the shelf. I don't mean the self fell down, I mean the entire thing collapsed. The screws stripped out of the holes that hold the top on, the sides fell over and the screws ripped through the bottom of the sides, you get the idea. Currently strapped together with several strips of duct tape and will remain intact if no one looks at it funny. Very very disapointed."
4,Nice Little Shelf for the Money,"After checking out these shelves and others on Amazon, I checked around town for any deals I could find. Oddly enough, I found the exact same shelves at Big Lots for $25. I picked up two, took them home, and had them both together within the space of 30 minutes. It was a simple process, no glue needed, everything fit into place and the hardware included was just fine. They're not real big, but sitting side by side against the wall they look great. Each had an extra shelf left over, as I set them up for DVD storage. They hold about 26 DVDs per shelf, depending on whether they're single or double DVDs and how tight you pack them."
1,terrible!,Cheaply made! Does not fit together correctly! The entire rack wobbles around and is not sturdy!
2,"okay, but not quite what's described","It does not have ""2 fixed shelves and 4 adjustable shelves."" All six shelves are adjustable, which means it's unstable. It wiggles a few inches from side to side when you touch it. I placed mine up against a different (stable) shelf, and that solved the problem; luckily it leans in the right direction. If you don't have something for it to lean on, you'll have to anchor it to your wall (they don't include anything to anchor it with, although they do include a random tube of what I assume is glue -- I guess they have a sense of humor about their craftmanship).Also, it doesn't hold 112 DVDs unless you stack them sideways. It holds about 96, with a CD-sized shelf left over. If you use it to store CDs or a combination of CDs and DVDs, then the advertised capacity is accurate."
3,Varies from unit to unit,"I bought three of these. Two are sturdy, no problems, well worth the price. The third is another story - as reported by other reviewers, the shelves fell down. I'd say there's a quality control problem here."
1,Flimsy - but you get what you pay for...,For under $60.00 - should have known this storage unit was not going to last. Only have 1 1/2 shelves used with DVD's - the shelves constantly fall... pegs that hold the shelves in are small and useless...Spend a little more dough and get something that will last.
2,Atlantic Multi-Media cabinets,"Disapppointing.. They had less capacity than anticipated, and the materials, while acceptable, were not of good quality."
1,Flimsy is an understatement,"DVDs stored on this shelf would get seasick - the whole thing wobbles like crazy. Wood is okay, but materials that hold the wood together are terrible. Don't buy, even for the low price."
2,Patty loveless Collection,"Not the Patty of old. She screams her way through the songs. Way to much instrument mix, very poor production mix. I won't be ordering anymore of her music, time has taken it's toll on Patty's singing ability."
2,"OK, I guess","The one redeeming track here is ""Who's on First"". But to tell you the truth, you can easily download this, so I'm not so sure this CD gives you a great added value. If you are absolutely positively crazy about baseball, this is an OK purchase. But it's no great deal."
1,It shrinks,"I love the bed, but this cheap sheet shrinks (and so does the bolster sheet) after washing in cold water and line-drying. Can't even use it now - should have just saved my money and used an old bed sheet."
1,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP PURE TRASH!","I can't believe how cheaply this cover is made. It's not even an entire cover, it's more like a fitted sheet. I ended up throwing mine away. Plus, it has an awful chemical smell that I'm sure is formaldehyde. If you do decide to order this, just know that it's not worth the packaging it's sent in."
2,Thin bath towel works fine,"I was very disappointed how flimsy the cover is. ""Did I pay $12 (size M) for this?"" came to my mind immediately. I can make a better cover. I understand the cover needs to be somewhat thin. But this is see through thin. Please see ""customer image"". Any young dog will destroy it in a day. I can wrap the bed with old pillow case perhaps? I will return it. TG it was a free shipping deal."
1,"Imagine the crappiest sheets ever, and then shrink them down to dog bed size...","I understand that any cover for this kind of bed would need to be thin, but this cover seems incredibly cheap. Unless this cover's price goes way down, you'd be better off covering the bed with a thin blanket. It was priced at $12.99 at the time of this review..."
1,It shrinks,I followed the manufacturer's instructions to wash and line dry the sheet. It shrunk and does not fit the bed. It is a giant waste of money.
1,Is there an option for 0 stars?,"Don't waste your money. The material is thin and cheap, and I'd have to say a kid in a Junior High home economics class would need to do better making something like this or be faced with a very disappointing grade. The product description unfortunately isn't lying, only because these are obviously the only covers produced for the Cool Bed 3."
4,Staying cool,"our dogs love it. got to get the cover for the cool bed, but the picture was of the wrong cover."
1,fitted sheet,This felt very cheap and didn't quite fit the cool bed properly. I wouldn't waste my money!
2,dog sheets,"The name leads you to believe you're getting a total of 3 sheets, but i should have looked closer and realized that's the name of the company, and it does shrink, even if you follow the washing instuctions, wished I would have put my money towards another type of dog cover."
1,Never received this item due to out of stock. Would still like it though.,"This item was never received. Out of stock. Would still like to order but not in stock, can't have it then."
1,"Great Idea, But Buy More Than 1",These help with the look of the cool beds and are thin enough to offer comfort for the dog but THEY SHRINK! We washed in cold and it did not matter. Buy more than 1 to be safe!
1,paper thin and skimpy,"It does not seem to make sense for the cool bed, it like a big doily. Waste of money, it should come free w the cool bed"
3,AVERAG,WORKED FOR A FEW MONTHSTHEN IT GREW SOMETHING ON IT WHICH I COULD NOT GET OFF. BUT IT WORKED WHILE I HAD IT
1,poor quality,poor quality fabric. doesn't fit well. I would just use a blanket instead of buying the sheet.
1,flimsy bed cover,"Less than two weeks after being purchased the 10 year old labrador had chewed off the the corner of the cover, and into the bed, and this is a dog that doesn't normally chew. This is a flimsy cheap quality product."
3,Don't wash it!,"The cover was great, and fit the bed properly. Until we washed it. After a trip through the washing machine (on the cold gentle cycle) and the dryer (again on gentle) it shrank enough that it doesn't fit the bed properly anymore."
5,Over and Over - Great stuff from beginner to advanced,This one has depth... My wife has a few different ladies styling videos but this is the one she plays over and over... As she's improved she has reviewed the DVD and continues to look sexier as she integrates the more advanced styling she skipped the first few viewings. It made her a better dancer when we started and she continues to find little gems as we move toward advanced dancers.
2,I must be missing something,"I was very glad to see a DVD called Ladies Styling on the market. But I must say that I am very disappointed with the material. Half the DVD discusses wearing hats, scarves and accessories to add something to your dancing. And then a ten minutes about how to use a device to make you stand up straighter. Just show me the moves and how to make the moves look better! Don't waste my time with silly names and a fashion show!"
1,Poor - Dont buy,"This is the worst DVD that Edie has made. this one is more about fashion and dancing to a fashion.Millenium style yeah no problem, but not this DVD. I would NOT recommmend buying it.There are some other good ones. Check around"
1,"oh, boy, does this book sucks !","I liked very much ""Prizzi's Honor"" (the book AND the movie) - but this is one of the worst books I ever red; the author really tried to be funny - and failed. At every page. Don't loose Your money buying it (it is NOT worth one penny+shipping) and don't waste Your time reading it, even if You get it for free"
1,Not Compatible with Leopard,Quite simply- the program does not work! Neither the manufacture nor Amazon were of much help resolving this problem. UHG!
5,Peachy,I'm a gumball fanatic! I <3 gum. I have gumball machines at work and at home.Peaches n Cream Gumballs are some of the best tasting gumballs I've ever had. They are really peachy!They have a similar flavor to the peach ring gummies.
3,"Home is good, Business needs some work.","The Home version of this program is very good, perhaps 4 or 5 stars. The Business version is a little buggy. I woud give it 2 stars for an average for the product of 3 stars.If you know what you're doing you won't have a problem. The Business program isn't set up to handle large screen fonts, formatting will be off but you can figure it out. In addition you can't import last year's data unless you actually have the last year's version installed. No way am I going to keep tax software on my computer once I've filed!"
2,Disappointing import,Have used taxcut premium for many years. With a new small business moved to taxcut home and business. Very disappointed to discover that Taxcut Home & Business will not import last years data from Taxcut Premium. I expect products from the same vendor to have seamless transition. After all this was not a switch to Turbo Tax. I'm sure it's a great program but who wants to manually reenter all their information. Will drop back to Taxcut Premium and will not use Home & Business this year or again.
3,Customer service stinks!,"The product is ok, but I am a tax professional and know where to put things. I have used Turbo tax in the past and prefer it greatly over this product. Also, I was needing to get Cd's to update my program due to trouble with my internet connection and was told that the business updates wouldn't be available until after March 30... Corporate tax returns are DUE March 15th. They were very unhelpful and rude!"
4,"An ""all-inclusive/every form possible"" but buggy and brittle","If you want a cheap, all forms (1120, 990, 1065, W2s,1099s etc) of every shade and color, then this is your program. Warning though, it is brittle and will wipe out a return in process if you are not careful. Hit the ""save"" button often. Somewhat cumbersome to use on top of that.Printing returns caused printing problems so I used their option to print in pdf format and then printed off of my Acrobat program. May be a memory problem of my machine.A cheap solution if you only need to prepare a few returns. A 2 star program rated 4 stars based on inclusiveness and price.Update: a few problems in running program, now the downloads appear to have everything working right...early April."
2,Old-fashioned Language,"I like Margaret Wise Brown, but I felt that the language in this book didn't flow very well. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library before buying. I was disappointed.There is also a mention of ""heaven"", which I did not expect. That is not a discussion I was ready to get into at bedtime."
2,Attractive But Not Quality,"I love how this futon looks, and it also feels high quality at first--very substantial and heavy. However, first appearances can be deceiving. This futon has almost fallen apart after about 3 years of use by 2 average weight people. One of the support bars has snapped at the joint and the screws have stripped the wood leaving the whole thing very wobbly. This would be great futon for a guest room where it doesn't get a lot of use. As an everyday couch... unfortunately it just doesn't hold up."
2,Cheaply made,Very cheap looking. The finish is very poor. The entire thing is very flimsy. I would not recommend this product.
4,emachines' T4892,"To start off with, I'm surprised by the bad reviews this computer has recieved on this site. This is my 3rd emachine in several years and I've never had bad luck with any of them. The only reason I didn't give this computer 5 stars is that it only shipped with 256MB Ram and has a CD R/RW instead of the current DVD R/RW. That was adequate for me until recently and I am in the process of upgrading with another 512MB today. I originally bought this model about 2 years ago and my kids (8&12) also used (abused) it for about 1 1/2 of those 2 yrs. The only problems I've had are software related.My next computer will likely be another emachine or another self built one. I'd recommend this over a Dell any day. I've used other name brand computers, too, mostly at work and my emachine has been better than any of them, for the money. I bought mine at Best Buy for $400.00 and change."
2,After 9 Months,"Dead...wont even boot up. Luckily eMachines has a good tech support and they are willing to give me a new PC. But ofr the nine months it worked, it was a great value for the money. I'll only recommend it if I saw it work for longer than that."
5,"Great Service, Great Price !","My wife has been purchasing Shalimar for over 50 years and in the past 5 years the pricehas sky rocketed up to the point that she had decided that we could not afford to buy it anymore. Just by chance, I put Shalimar into the Amazon search space and ""Shazam"" it popped up at a discounted price that was lower than what we had paid at the Mall Department store over 5 years ago. THANK YOU AMAZON, you have kept both my wife and my budget happy !"
5,Wotks as I expected.,This product works just as I expected. Although I found out after I bought this item that there was Pocketwizards. I still enjoy pulling this out and using it for short wireless tethering ao all my flashes.
5,Great for advanced amateurs looking to try something different,"The Nikon SU-800 is a very useful product and it synchs up with my SB-600 quite easily. My pictures have a more professional look, IMO. I read somewhere that directional lighting makes a photo look a bit more polished and I have this with the SU-800. My only caveat is that I would make sure to have to flash's manual around when choosing channels and stuff. It took my an hour to figure it out with out the manuals and as soon as I used the manuals, I was up and running.Good luck and happy pictures!"
3,"5 stars in the past, but 3 stars now..Old design","It works perfectly for shooting in short distance or in studio, however, it's not work well for outdoor. The direction and power of IR flash should be improved ASAP. It works only in front direction. Sometimes, I want to fire flash units around me, in studio it might be okay because of the reflection, but it can't work outdoor. LCD display and the buttons are very old design, and difficult to work with.In conclusion, this flash was born to be Macro photography with their set. If one want to use it outdoor, and can trigger in all direction. I suggest SB-800 or SB-900 with their diffuser.In addition, if Nikon still want to use wireless IR system, they should concern about IR sensor on the flash too. Now all flashes have only one IR sensor on one side. It means you have to twist the flash in order to receive the signal. For TTL of M flash mode, they are fine, but A flash mode is problematic."
3,Batteries,"I just got the SU-800. It seems to work exactly as expected, except not on the page for the product nor in any of the reviews I read did someone feel like mentioning that this thing doesn't use AA batteries. I had to go out and buy some CR123 batteries. Apparently, the flashes on the macro system use these too and that's why, but I only plan to use them with my SB 800 an SB 600 units, which all use AA's. Now, not only do I have a mix in battery types, but I have to either go get a new charger or keep buying new batteries. That's a bit of a pain."
5,Light My Fire,"The Nikon SU-800 commander is such a great way for me to create lightfrom wherever I want. I do not like flash especially from the camera.This is a very portable way of doing amazing photo's anywhere, even atnight in the dark and form any angle with a few small flashes on standsor just hand held.Opens up a new world of photo opportunities. Highly recommended.ray kennedy"
1,What Happened?,This album shouldn't exist. I tried to force myself to like it but it didn't happen. Too me the last good album from these guys was Infinity. There is no depth to any songs on this album and the production is really bad compared to their previous albums. A few tracks sounded like they had potential but didn't and the rest are basically fillers. If they ever put out another album hopefully it will be alot better than their last 3 attempts.
3,Where&#65533;s the power?,"Well, it?s not a bad album. But it?s not a really good one either.At least not what fans of this band are expecting. Don?t get me wrong, I like the album, in fact is more hard rock than power metal and of course i like hard rock, but this is not our good old Stratovarius. So if you want speed get Sonata Arctica, or get dissapointed with this cd."
1,ANOTHER CRAPY ALBUM FROM THIS BAND BUT DIFFERENT,"My friend bought this album and this album is different from all of their other album's.It's not so much happy sounding as their other albums,but it still sucks!"
4,Gotta be open minded.,"Its not fair to run this band down because they have pushed their old sound out and came out with a much darker and deeper album. There was obviously alot of turmoil for a long time and it shows in the music and lyrics. Give this a chance. Dont be close minded. Its dark, slower to mid paced, a few rockers and they are trying to branch out. This is metal for people who think outside the box."
3,Could be...,"If you know stratovarius from their previous albums, you may not like this one. There is no double bass drumming here, almost no keyboards and no great guitar solos. Stratovarius definately changed with this album. The style now is just normal heavy metal, but with a slow pace. If you buy lots of heavy metal albums just because it's heavy metal, you may check this one out. If your looking from something really groundbreaking, you won't find it in this album, although it's a quite solid one."
3,Kinda Bulky But Holds A lot,"This back pack does hold it all but there are a couple of draw backs. The water bottles are not freezer safe. I like to fill mine half full and freeze them so the water stays colder longer on hot days. Both water bottles cracked and were ruined. Also I don't like the side straps. If you are a woman and of average waist size, then there is a lot of left over strap on both sides that even though there are clips to keep the extra in line, it doesn't hold it all neatly and it ends up dangling on both sides. The one thing good about this pack is it holds a lot of stuff. Two water bottles and the other pockets are very roomy. I can pack a small plastic water dish for my dog in the larger compartment and still have plenty of room for other things. I just didn't like the bulkiness of it as a unit and the messy extra long side straps."
5,Rating,One of Brando's greatest underated performances in my opinion. His naturalism is simply unmatched by any other actor I can think of. I still miss the fact he has left us.
4,Worth seeing for the stellar cast,"I loved this film when it first came out, due probably to the amazing cast. It's still wonderful to watch this group of talented, beautiful actors, all in their prime. The story doesn't hold up as well but it is well enough done to hold your interest."
2,Some good Brando moments,"This movie has a star studded cast, and Brando gets beaten to a pulp, which he always seems to enjoy, but the movie is only mediocre, actually feels very long and slow. But anytime Brando is on screen it is worth watching."
2,Not That Great,"Considering the superb aggregation of writing and acting talent here, one would expect a much better film than this; however, the finished product proved to be far less than memorable. The script is weak, the story is muddled, and no one gives a particularly noteworthy performance. The worst culprit is the horribly miscast Marlon Brando, who mumbles even more than usual, rendering much of his dialogue nearly unintelligible. Not recommended."
4,Loved THE CHILDREN OF GAIA book but no so much the UKTENA...,"The reason I give this one 4 stars and not three is because the CHILDREN OF GAIA part of it is really good. Cries Havoc is a great Metis, and his story is very felt, to put it in some way.But the Uktena part of the book... didn't get to me. Maybe it was because they were introducing a new character halfway down the road, and that she felt so out of the story... Yes, she had some things in common with the main plot, such as the bad guy and the sphere Arkady ends up waiting, but I'm afraid that if this book hadn't been there, no one would have miss a thing about the plot...Maybe my words are harsh but I couldn't see the time of ending this part of the book so I could move to the next."
3,Scriabin Fair,I did not like the fact that some of the material was recorded 15 years ago and not indicated by seller.
3,hunting un limited 4,the game has some improvements but not many!! it's about the same as unlimited 3 but just a little harder and i think less animals !!! wayne of PA
3,hunting unlimitrd 4,"I have the complete set. Number 3 is the best. I bought number 4 hoping that it would be as good. I was surprised of the poor quality. The game is too easy, for instance, in taking a elephant, a shot to the head was all it took. In no.3, there was only a certain area of the head that was the target. I had fun playing the game but was disapoined with the challenge. I give it a an average score , hoping for improvement, if there is a no.5."
2,Too Slow,"this game needs to move along, give the player a lot more shots per minute. I am patient, but not that patient"
2,Tastes great but,"The gumballs taste awesome, but the flavor doesnt last long. I can deal with the flavor going away after a few minutes, but this gums sticks to your teeth. I gave away about half of my gumballs and everyone loved them until they stuck to their teeth. I wont be ordering these again."
2,"marginally better than the other two flavors- gorgeous color, terrible taste","I have no problems with the seller or the shipping, but I really didn't expect these things to taste this awful. They aren't inedible, but what I get out of most gumball machines tastes far better- these have a definite rubber taste, a weird sweetness (not real sweet, just... chemically sweet I guess? it's weird) I am hoping this odd flavor isn't from sitting in a warehouse for years on end.If it seems like a cut an paste review, that's because it is. all 3 products (three flavors of gumballs) were identical."
3,Paradise Wild,"Not one of Johanna Lindsey's best books; but she is a GREAT writer. I have read every single one of her novels and enjoy them all. She knows how to write to touch a woman's heart. I wrote to her once, years ago, and she hand wrote me a letter back. She is the all time BEST Romance writer in my book!"
3,Not her best by FAR,"I LOVE JL, but this is her worst work to compare all her work to. The frustration you feel for the heroine is just the begining. The hero is not much of a hero. He does these things to the heroine out of his moronic ""justification"" to avenge his father. Then just leaves the heroine to deal with the havoc he has wreaked,then doesn't think twice about her. We are suppose to believe through all this that he comes to love her and she him, when I came away thinking, they deserve each other. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking into reading Johanna Lindsey for the first time,wait til you've read her other fantastic books to get an idea of how she usually writes,this isn't it. I gave her 3 stars because she's the best in romance authors today, and everyone has an off time, or a bomb. hope this helps anyone interested in reading her books."
1,No Paradise Here...,"Oh Johanna...I loved her Malory novels, she should stick to what works. Both characters had me so annoyed I only continued reading in hopes that they would grow on me (with hopes that they would become better people). Unfortunately this story continued to frustrate me throughout and as an avid romance reader this could very well sit on the bottom of my list. Not only did I find the characters both lacking a moral compass, I could not sympathize with either and couldn't care less what happened in the end. I also felt that this novel was borderline culturally offensive with no real lessons learned by either character. Very disappointing."
4,Paradise wild,Not as good as her other novels. It was nice but a bit ficle too. But I love Johanna Lyndsey
2,Paradise Wild,Main characters are not appealing individuals and their romance seems very implausible. Not believeable. The female is not even a very nice person and I found myself having no sympathy for her. The man is a jerk and he's not much better at the end.
2,Paradise? Wild,I read this book early in my love affair with Johanna Lindsey heros. This was one of two (A Pirate's Love being the other) I wish had gotten away from my stack of books to be read. The hero was too angry (abusive). The only reason it gets two stars is for a strong beginning which sets up a potentially great spurned love scenario. I wish the rest of the book had lived up to its beginning. Perhaps a good replacement title for this place on the list would be Once a Princess.
1,Romance? You're Kidding!,"This is the first book by Johanna Lindsey that I've read and I can't believe it could be classified as a romance. Jared and Corrinne are two of the least engaging characters I've met in a 'romance' novel. Jared is vengeful, violent and vicious. Corrinne is spoilt, bad tempered and completely unloveable. So Jared has, as a little boy, witnessed the death of his mother by suicide - yes, a traumatic experience for sure, but I could not forgive his violence towards Corrinne nor his downright vindictiveness. Men who are violent towards women are NOT romantic figures and should not be portrayed as such. Ask any woman who is the victim of domestic violence. I was appalled to find Jared and Corrinne having passionate sex after a particularly violent episode. I could see no development of any deep loving feelings. Corrinne just wakes up one day knowing she loves this violent creep - but with her background and personality, how would she know anyway?"
2,Paradise but Boring,"This is not Joanna Lindsey at her best; like the little girl with the curl, when she's good she's very good and when she's bad she's horrid. Here she is merely predictable with rather boring main characters. There is no chemistry and little plot.Not a keeper."
1,Very disappointing -- not up to JL's usual standards!,"I normally love JL's books, however, this one I really, really didn't like. First of all, it was difficult to get engaged with the story because both of the main characters were so unlikeable. The romantic ""hero"" is a man bent on revenge ... OK, I could deal with that. What I couldn't get past was this ""hero"" rapes and then later hits Corinne. I couldn't get past either of those acts and couldn't figure out why she would either. Corinne, however, decides to chase after her deserter husband and pose as a whore (after first deciding to adopt out her baby and then deciding to keep it but not tell Jared). By the time they both admitted to loving the other, my only question was ""WHY?"". Unlikeable characters, slow plot, unbelievable ""romance"" ... the only saving grace was a peek into Hawaii prior to/during the revolution."
3,"Okay, but not her best...","As an avid fan of Ms. Lindsey, I have to admit it was good, but felt a little tedious to read. The lead characters are Jared and Corrine. The characters play a ""cat and mouse"" game, and deception is sprinkled throughout the story. Jared and Corrine join one night, leaving Corrine pregnant. Corrine clings to another which she essnetially ""uses"" in her quest to find Jared. Jared of course assumes that the child is anothers, only to find out in the end that it is indeed his child and that he has been duped. I don't know too many men that 1)would not pick up that it is their child and 2)that would get back with that same woman. It is a wild tale, I just didn't think that characters would really behave in such a manner. Perhaps if Ms. Lindsey developed the book more (it isn't that long in lenfth), then perhaps the plot could be developed into something more plausible."
4,A Pleasant Afternoon Read,"What sets this book apart from Ms. Lindwey's other books is the setting. This is not a Regency, Medieval, Viking, Sci-Fi Fantasy or Western Romance. Rather it is a book with the backdrop of the romantic island of Oahu, Hawaii. It is a story of mutual hate turned to love. There is nothing extraordinary about it, no memorable characters, not a gripping plotline, nothing that is the true hallmark of a fantastic Lindsey book. Yet it is a pleasant read."
2,romance book,"this has got to be one of the most stupid books I have ever read an english lord dresses up in a grass skirt at a ball in the 1800's to impress a lady from an island and she is dressed up in a ball gown, It is one of ms Lindsey's earlier works so maybe thats why it so stupid as soon as I got to that part I went to read the ending and threw it out."
4,"Great ""vanilla"" Releases!","Good video/audio quality, none of the episodes appear to be edited, and the menus, while not flashy, present the show well in both English and Spanish.Ok, that's the boring technical stuff. YAAAAAY!!!! Superbook!!!! on DVD!!!! It is great to have this quirky, Japanese-animated, time-travel, Bible-story show released on DVD. The show often had interesting angles on important Biblical events (did you know a robot from the future tried to stop Eve from committing ""original sin""? :) ) while still sticking to the important message.Apparently they plan to release both seasons, since Volume 2 says ""2 of 13,"" there are 4 eps per disc, 13 * 4 = 52, and each season had 26 episodes...I'm hoping that either the ""last"" DVD in each set has special features (though Spanish-language versions are more special than you'd think), or they're going to plan for a deluxe version later on. Either way, this is a must, for families and churches alike...dive into Superbook!"
3,"Good to see superbook, but no Japanese track is lame","This may have been initiated by an American company, but it was made for a Japanese audience... I want to see THAT superbook, not the Americanized version, even if both versions are technicaly official. I wish CBN would release an unaltered version of Anime Oyako Gekijo. They'd get a whole new audience for that (the hardcore anime fans who probably started their fandom on Superbook)"
5,Bedtime Favorite,"My daughter LOVES this book. We read it every night for WEEKS. She memorized it and now ""reads"" it to ME!"
5,A book from my childhood,I have this book from when I was a kid and now read it to my little boy. I love all of Mercer Mayer's books. They were a huge part of my childhood and I love passing that on.
5,Super cute book!,My four year old loved this book and all the books from this author that we purchased. We read them to him over and over and surprising I didnt get sick of them.
4,A nice Addition,"What can I say? This is a good CD. It great for gaming, but in my opinion thats about it. I don't usually listen to this type of music. As to be expected it sounds a lot like music from many games. My big complaint is its length. It's less than 30 minutes."
5,This is an amazing though heart-wrenching book,"I am a 12 year old reader, and this book was heart-breaking. It is so sad that something like this hapenned, and so many peoples' lives were destroyed. Molyda Szymusiak's story makes me realize how lucky I am to enjoy my freedoms."
5,Every human being should read this book!,"This is one of those books, once you start reading you can't stop. I can't even describe the horror and atrocity the Cambodian people had to endure under the Khmer Rouge, but Molyda's book is heart breaking because the story is told from the child's viewpoint. This is a wonderful book describing an event that should never have happened. Hopefully after reading this book, people will never let genocide and a holocaust exist ever again on this earth!"
1,Extremely salty,"Definitely won't buy these again. Very, very salty. Too bad because the idea is great. I was eager for a low carb snack but this isn't it."
4,Good Low carb snack,"There aren't too many pieces in the bag, but if you just have the munchies and need to do something about it, these are tasty and crunchy. They're good for the low carb dieter."
2,wayyyyy too salty,"these little snacks would have been ever so much better if they had lightened up on the salt...wow, was like licking a salt block...."
2,"Too salty, not good.","Sorry, but this is not edible for me. Way too salty, strong flavor, but not a cheese flavor. Wish I could order a sample of these products."
5,"Satisfying, nutritional snack","I have been on a weight loss regimen and triedthis on a friend's suggestion. It is crunchy, cheesywith a salty component while being a protein andcalcium snack . Order more than one box, as everyoneLikes them!"
5,Salty fix,These small little crunchy cheese snacks are pretty tasty.... it's like the crusty cheese that gets stuck on the side of a casserole dish out of the oven.... yum.
4,Satisfying and Healthy,"I was looking for a natural snack to take to work, these are very satisfying and great tasting. The only drawback is the cost."
2,"Quality of life, but not at any cost","I'm diabetic, and bought these because they were included when I did a search on ""diabetic snacks"". Looked good, taste like... well, let's just say that I'll just have to find a different way to enjoy."
1,YUCK!,looks good from the package but doesn't taste good at all. hard crunchy freeze dried flavor.save your money guys!
1,disgusting...,"This product was really bad...way too salty, very small and tasted gritty and-I noticed afterwards-that even the pkg. smelled awful!Guess I can use them in soup or Not! [I only clicked one star because there wasn't a no-stars or minus-one star available...]! I called to leave a message; and am waiting to hear from customer service...will update if/when they call me back. One week later-no callback...I'll bet they have gotten plenty complaints. I'll call back Monday[and Tues.,and Weds., etc.; and report back! After at least three weeks of calling, waiting for a callback, and leaving messages; I haven't heard a word. I'd bet that they have heard these complaints ALOT...and can't be bothered. How rude...'Jenny' is the CSR who was, hopefully, supposed to call back...or not! Amazon-I hope you no longer carry these 'products' out of concern for people who actually think they are buying edible snack [while only wasting money]. When-in reality hungry birds and fish won't even eat them!"
2,Good dog treats,"I was really disappointed when I opened my box of snacks yesterday. This product claimed to be pure cheese and even says it contains no MSG when in fact it has autolyzed yeast, maltodextrin and yeast extract. For those who don't know those are just synonyms for MSG but they hide it under any name they can. Check out the site www.msgmyth.com."
1,Eeew,"Disappointed because I really wanted o like them. Not impressed at all. Just very weird tasting. No thanks, won't be ordering those again."
3,Great product too much sodium,"I love that the snacks are good in protein, low carbohydrates, but the amount of sodium is too much. I hope my letter to the company will help them develop a low sodium product. In the meantime, I only eat one of the packages every two weeks of less. I am looking forward to the more healthy product. If you are not concerned about the sodium content, then this is the snack to eat."
2,Weird and gritty,"They are hard and crunchy, very salty, and with a hint of a burnt taste. They are gritty after chewing and need to be washed down with some water. I was hoping for something more like cheetos, but that's probably not possible with pure cheese. I prefer my own chips made by microwaving slices of cheddar. A positive is that these are a low carb snack that doesn't need refrigeration and you can eat on the run."
5,1 carb,"The low carb WOL means giving up most of the crunchy salty snacks we so love. These are a great companion snack to the pork rind, crunchy like a cracker and cheesey 1 carb + 70 cal. Great little snack pack for the brown bag."
4,Crunchy Relief!,"Although the I agree w/the previous review to a point, the many flavors that this product comes in have helped me GREATLY through my crazy-crunch attacks! Yes, they have a unique taste at first, but I'm oddly attracted to these critters now! I say to give 'em a try...I'm addicted."
1,Only 11-14 pieces per package!!!,"I have purchased this product several times before but this time I was unpleasantly surprised to find the amount of product in the package has shrunk significantly! The packaging states approximately 22 pieces per bag, but I started counting pieces after my first bag seemed very light and I'm finding 11-14 pieces per bag. Not worth the price!!!"
1,"If you want to mainline salt, these will do the job","I love crunchy cheese goodies. I thought these White Cheddar Just the Cheese snacks would be a nice little treat but when I tried them, I thought I had bitten into a salt lick. I have never eaten cheese that was even half as salty as these little bits. They were toasty and crunchy but the salt overwhelms everything. I won't be reordering."
1,YUK,"These things are HORRIBLE! They are very salty, have very little flavor and are just plain nasty. Don't waste your money on these.... go buy some real cheese and have that instead!"
4,Yummy,"I took a star off for the high fat and sodium content, but if you are primarily concerned with protein, carbs, or calories, this is not a bad snack. Yes, they are salty. But, I have now had the pizza, jalapeno, white cheddar, and grilled cheese and I like them all. They are consistent and the price is good. My husband and I like them for a quick crunchy snack. The portioning is good and they satisfy me."
1,Way to salty for snacking.....,"I would not buy these again. They are so salty and leave a briney aftertaste. Can be used as croutons for soup or salad, but not just eaten plain. It makes for very expensive coutons. Great concept, but poor execution."
2,Umm....Well I really wanted to like these,I was so excited to get these. After WLS it's hard to find a savory snack with protien. Sooo I open the package and they are SUPER SALTY!! I like salt but these are runner up to a hamsters salt lick. Also a very strange texture. If I were you I'd pass on these. I gave it two stars for effort. But I have a box of 15 left if anyone wants 'em.
1,Yuck,bland and dry; lots of salt and little bit of... I don't know... it's like a dusty taste. I love cheese but this is really not pleasant.
1,I wish I had listened,I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews. This product is pricey for what you get---the little burned piece of cheese on the pan from some cheese dish! It is so salty and so not worth it. It's not a taste treat. It is 1 carb of never-mind. Do not waste your money or taste buds on this.
3,"Low in Carbs, High in Sodium!","Be careful! The low carbs get you, but if you have a problem with sodium, realize the content is high! I have been buying these ""crunchy cheese snacks"" in Classic White Cheddar for a couple of years. I was originally drawn by the low carbs per serving bag. The 1/2 oz bag says ""1 g"". I bought them by the box of 16 packs. I used ""subscribe and save"" and started buying 4 boxes of 16 - 1/2 oz bags, per month. That's 64 of these 1/2 oz bags each month. They are also available in 2 oz bags. Plus, they grow on you. Literally. I knew, but didn't take into consideration the high sodium - 275mg per 1/2oz bag - until recently. A rep at the company told me they were working to cut the sodium content. I hope it happens, soon. I won't buy any more until they do. I like that they are also Gluten-Free. It's just too much sodium for a little bag and people should be aware of it."
2,"I like most low-carb snacks, but ...","These have a very odd flavor, and are WAY too salty. They don't taste like cheese at all. I've been living the South Beach lifestyle for years, and typically enjoy low- or no-carb snacks. I couldn't eat these. Try Aunt Lizzie's No-Carb Cheese Straws instead (they taste like Cheez Its)!"
1,Like eat packing peanuts with flavored salt,"Maybe the other flavors are better, but the nacho cheese flavor was terrible. Bless those who gave it 5 stars for they have no tastebuds."
2,Too Salty Too Bad,I was hopeful for a crunchy low carb snack and gave these a try. These were okay but too salty for me. I doubt I will re-order.
1,Unpleasant at best.,"If eating delicious cheese were a sin, then consuming these little dry nuggets tastes like the penance for that sin.I wanted to like this product. I bought a box of 16 packets and could not bring myself to finish one."
2,I wish I hadn't bought a whole pack of them...,"I thought these would be a little bit more like potato chips, but they are small bite-sized bits. That is totally fine, but they weren't particularly GOOD. I think they have more of a rice-cake consistancy than a potato chip consistancy. The taste is a little weird too. If I eat too many of them they make my stomach upset. UGH."
2,Salty and a tad boring,"I like the single-serving bags, and this is the second batch of JtC rounds I've bought, but they certainly aren't my favorite snack.They are crunchy, and have a decent texture, but they're saltier than I'd prefer. They're what I reach for when I want something salty, or when I'm just bored with the rest of the snacks on hand.I'm not sure I can tell a difference between the Nacho flavor rounds and the ""plain"" ones."
2,Not for human consumption,"I had high expectations for this product considering the other reviews, but I cannot choke these things down. Not trying to down talk these things, but I just can't eat them. To me its just short of flavered cardboard. Oh well."
1,Barely Edible,"I was kind of excited about this product before it came in. I found them in a little Atkins carb counter brochure, and thought I'd give it a shot. I was very disappointed to find out that they do NOT taste like cheese crust. They taste like salted cardboard, but being I am sticking to this low carb thing, I do find myself eating them just for the crunch and the fact that I have already wasted $17 bucks on them."
1,Even my dogs did not like them!,"Both my husband and I love to try new things and when we heard about these I immediately ordered 2 different flavors ; cheese & pizza.They arrived and we hated them. They have no flavor, they are dry and they are boring. Even my dog did not want them and usually they will eat anything!A waste of my money, I threw them all out."
3,Not bad but too expensive,"These are OK. Not great, not horrible.I am doing low carb and was looking for a good snack. These are definitely not worth the cost for the tiny little serving, plus it is pretty easy to make something similar yourself. So, I will not be buying again unless they are significantly discounted, say around 50 cents or less a serving."
2,Salt licks,"These are tasty, but after I'd eat a bag, my heart would practically seize. I looked at the packaging and it was 275mg of sodium. I threw the rest away. What a bummer. So tasty, but way way way way way too much salt!"
1,Gross,These were gross. It was like chomping down on a chunk of salt. I regret wasting my money and will not purchase in the future
3,Liked them better when the piece size was larger...,"These are ok but I'm not sure if I'll get them again. There are other options as far as low carb that seem to be a better snack option. Quality was fine, I was just underwhelmed with the change to a smaller piece size since the last time I ordered."
2,NOt good,"I love burned cheese, so I thought I would like these. Ick, was I wrong. They taste very weird, not like cheese, and almost made me feel sick.Wouldn't recommend. I'll stick with pork rinds for my low carb snacks."
3,no carb snack,"I found this really offers a crunchy snack for me while doing the no carb diet. However, I find I can make my own from shredded paremsan, almost as good!"
5,crunchy and delicious,"Very very good! It's like when you make a pizza and the cheese melts off and hits the pan and gets all crispy, only much more convienient since it's in a single serving bag. Just to warn you, this is dry, seasoned, crunchy cheese. If you are expecting something chewy, you will be sorely mistaken. Great for gluten-intolerant people(like me) too!"
5,yum !!,"I love these, if you like the taste of cheese that has been microwaved too long and gets crispy, you will like these.."
3,"kind of salty and dry, but a good crunch if you are carbo craving","These are very salty, and the nacho flavor on ""just cheese"" seems kind of redundant. The quantity in the bag is very scant. I understand that it is probably expensive to reduce cheese to these little crunchy treats."
3,Lo-Carb Pizza Flavor Snacks,"The taste if ""off"" on this product ... but acceptable. A sister product (see my review) ""Just The Cheese White Cheddar"" is much, much better tasting."
4,"Tasty, but tiny!","I was expecting something akin to cheese-flavored rice cakes. These were much tastier! Crunchier too. However, I was also expecting each bag to be the size of a small bag of potato chips. Wrong. The bags are just a little larger than those of gummy fruit snacks. Each mini round is about the size of a nickel and there aren't all that many in a bag. I bought the Classic White Cheddar ones, which I found to be very yummy. I just wish there were more to enjoy for the price."
3,THese cheese bits have bite!,"If you like sharp cheese, this is for you. Unique because made from all cheese, would be great for those with very special food needs! My son didnt like them, but others did. Try! But dont buy too many packs, in case you dont like."
1,Worst snack I ever tasted!,"These are definitely the worst snack I have ever purchased in my life. Dry as the Sahara Desert, not much taste, and way overpriced. Save your hard-earned money for something else."
2,Very Disappointing,Based on the reviews I thought I'd give the Wisconsin Cheese flavor a try. Maybe my taste buds are getting to old. Not much taste. I guess I could alway use them for baiting my mouse traps.
3,Good but too salty,We ordered this item after a friend recommended them. They are very tasty but salty.The quality is good but the value just isn't there for my family.
2,just ok,"I had high hopes for these. I mean, crunchy cheese, what's not to love? But they have more of a ""processed"" taste than I would have liked. I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag. I gave them a fair chance, kept an open mind, but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to. The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese. Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase, I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors. Oh well, it was worth a try."
1,Flavor Yes Texture Bad,"Let's just say if you like eating cardboard with flavor then you'll love this product. I found the taste to be good but the texture of it was like eating cheese flavored cardboard. I am not trying to be funny, just honest."
3,OK as a low carb treat,"I have had some of the other cheese snacks, and liked the nacho flavored. If you have not had these before, they are literally cheese formed into a small disk and baked until hard like a cracker. Being a low carb guy, I like them because they are easy to pack along, and are reminiscent of the crunch you get from crackers. This particular flavor though, is underwhelming, there is not enough jalapeno flavor, and the whole thing tastes a bit like bland cheese. Still, they are ok, and I will eat them, but not as tasty as some of the other offerings....."
1,Wisconsin Cheddar? Tastes More Like Salt,"I can't eat these. All I taste is the salt, and so threw most of them in the trash. They are slandering Wisconsin, Wisconsin cheddar, and cheddar cheeses in general."
2,not for me.,"It kind of reminded me of a the dried out part of a piece of cheese that has been exposed to the air or was hidden for eons in the dairy drawer of my frige.Would not buy again. I actually tossed the boxes I did purchase. This product came recommended by a friend, so I am guessing it is all a matter of taste."
2,dissapointed,"Sorry, but not like I thought they would be. No one in the family thought they tasted anything like what they claimed to be like."
3,"Really delicious, but not worth the price.",I did enjoy the snacks. Since I am diabetic there are few such snacks I can get away with and this one did not affect my blood sugar adversely. However the cost is more than I can justify. I will be canceling my next shipment.
2,The Grilled Cheese Flavor - NOT so good!,"I really do love these snacks, BUT, the Grilled Cheese flavor is absolutely horrible! PLEASE pick another flavor unless you've tried this one and are sure you like it...This one is not a winner, IMHO!"
2,"I ""used"" to like them.","I used to eat ""Just the Cheese"" when it was in bigger bags a few years ago and they were good. But the snack size are just too salty.No problems with seller though. I received my order quickly."
1,A Sad State of Affairs,"Were they trying to make the most cliche & predictable post-punk record of all-time, or did it just happen on accident?"
5,To Answer John's question.,"It was released in the US in 1994 on VHS. The full title is So Far So Good And More. It contains some music videos as the commercially released video and some as live videos ie Cuts Like A Knife is the video from 1983, but (Everything I Do) I Do It For You is a live performance..which really is a great one..trust me! If you have the album So Far So Good, the only song on the album that there is no version of the video on this collection is Kids Wanna Rock. However, if you get the Reckless VHS you'll have the video for Kids Wanna Rock. I don't know why they did not release the DVD format here in the US, but as I said it was released here in 1994 on VHS. I hope I answered your question well enough!Chaitan"
5,How our culture shapes the rhythms of our life,"In this cogent and insightful book, Rakoff uses the law's treatment of time to illuminate how we organize our lives, and the sort of choices we make without even knowing we're making them: how things we assume are fixed are the product of social choices, which can be changed; how the usual explanations for such apparently inevitable ripples in the rhythms of life as time zones or the school year are artifacts of particular times and particular issues in American life. It's a liberating book."
1,Not a min bust!!!,"If you are expecting this product to be a similar 1/6 scale like the gentle giant mini busts, then you will be very diappointed like I was. The head of this figure and roughly the size of a 1:18 scale head which is tiny. This bust should have been labled MICRO BUST, but even Palisadses manufacturing messed up by putting ""mini bust"" on the item's box. Again do not buy this if you are expecting 1/6 scale because you won't like what you get for the price!!!"
3,bufpuf,"These facial sponges don't have the normal density that others have. They are a little rougher than most. However, I will use them."
2,More abrasive then a buff puff,"These have a nice price, but they are more abrasive then a buff puff so you may not want to use them on your face. They do not last as long as a buff puff."
2,Hmmmm,I used to buy the small round white cleansing puffs and I could use one of them for months. These break down a lot quicker so have to use them quicker.
1,"Embarrassingly basic, not worth your time or money","I bought this application thinking it would teach me just the basic phrases I would need as a business traveler or as a tourist. It does not even give you the bare minimum you would need to know when visiting a foreign country.You don't even learn how to ask for the price of something, what time of day it is, or how to count beyond three. I would like to devote more time to a more insightful review, but I'd say its not even worth the effort. Trust me, this is a big waste of your money and more importantly your time."
5,My dad reads me,one of these stories every night...I am leaning more important things than school... I learn about Goodness.I LOVE IT !
4,A complilation of their E.P.s,This band came and went a while ago but they could really write some good punk songs. The vocalist has a gruff voice but once you get beyond that you realize he is singing strong melodies. These are the compilations of their e.p.s which honestly I think is a stronger representation of them then their l.p. Duct Tape Soup.
5,this cd is great to listen to to get pumped up,"most of the songs on this cd make you wanna get up and jump around! it seems some of the bands on lookout records are killer. op ivy, pinhead gunpowder,older green day like 39/smooth, and crimpshrine + others i cant think of now. this is the first cd i got by crimpshrine and it is one of my favorites."
5,great backpack,"3 days before summer camp 1000 miles away and you find out you need a backpack? Amazon again to the rescue. Ordered a great backpack based on the reviews (thanks to all those who take the time to write), had it shipped direct to the camp. It was there when we arrived, as good an item as we expected. Thanks Amazon and thanks to reviewers!"
2,Poor quality,"Unfortunately the sleep sack did not come with a hook to attach it to the cage, causing our ferrets to drag it down to their litter box the first night. I put it in the wash (following the directions and on delicate cycle) and it tore itself apart. It's now no longer the advertised product - just a big piece of cloth with holes in it. We tried tried putting it back together but it was easy for the ferrets to tear it back up and make the holes even bigger. Until we washed it it did okay - as far as staying in one piece. There's just no way to keep it in one place in the cage."
1,Poor Quality. Don't Buy It,Unraveled along the seam the first time I washed it. It's now being used as a rag. Don't waste your money.
3,A must-read for insight into Bowles' other writing.,"Well worth reading if you're a fan of Bowles. Slow and mysteriously vaporous, like much of his fiction. Full of subtle insights (both intended and unintended) into his mind and his writing."
1,A complete waste of time and money!,"I bought this book thinking I would get some new and exciting information about the Powershot G5. Some tips and tricks on getting better photographs USING the G5 features. Instead, this book is just a combination of the EXACT same content from the Users Manual and any basic book on photography. Nothing new. Nothing exciting. Nothing interesting.It was also a big let down when I saw it. It's actually a bunch of black and white photocopies (Xerox) bound together in a spiral. Like a school report from the early 90's. It shouldn't cost more that five dollars.I believe the auther and publishers just put it together just to make some easy money. And I fell for it. I should've known when it had no reviews.After this, I will NEVER buy another book from them and I strongly suggest you see it before you buy it. No wonder you can't see the inside in amazon!!!"
4,It's cheesy but our 2 year old loves it,"My son got three of these DVDs as a gift -- the Mighty Construction/Sanitation/Farming Machines and this one is probably his favorite. Sure they are cheesy and the acting is.. well bad. One of the reviewers compared the construction video to a porn movie in terms of production and music track which I found funny (skip the plot, just get to the machines). Nevertheless, my son is facinated by the machines used to clean the beach and streets and can watch it over and over again."
5,Classic cardiovascular drugs book,"This is a classic of cardiovascular medicine. In its newest edition Opie's book is excellent in many ways: first, it is a small book, almost a pocket-book, and loaded with concise yet precise infformation. It is the kind of book you can put in your black bag and you can belive it will be valuable anywhere, from the ICU to the ambulatory. There are many excellent chapters on drugs, all of them with an solid pharmacological basis, each chapter is an great review of the subject. But the best of this book is that it is very practical: it goes straight to the problems more commonly found in the cardiology office or in the ICU, with the big advantage of being small and portable. An must-have book for physicians intrested in cardiology and in cardiovascular drugs pharmacology, also excellent for residents. Hope we have an new edition of this great book soon!"
3,Nice mositurizer,This is pretty much one of the nicest moisturizers I have seen that have some sunscreen included. It wasn't incredibly effective for anything other than that- but it didn't hurt either.
3,Not as good as the book.,This movie was just okay and a bit to voodoo to me. I much prefered the book. Francine Rivers is one of my very favorites. Read the book it is really good. If you plan to do both watch the DVD first then you won't be so disappointed. This I find often to be the case. Books are usually better because it is almost impossible to match the wonderful human minds ability to create the details.
3,interesting,not really a movie like this im not saying thats good but its worth watching ok quality easy to tell there was a strict budget. good story line with a good lesson. but i have only watched it one time and had it over 5 months
4,An Uplifting Film,this is a very spiritual and uplifting movie it's a good story about forgivness and faith this movie was excellent.
2,Contrived and Simplistic,"Simplistic and preachy with poorly executed ""Welsh"" accents. There is no real insight or understanding into the history and culture of Appalachia, or should I say, those ""wicked mountains."" Pretty colors, though."
4,The Last Sin Eater,"It was on time and in good shape but the second time we watched it, it had a scratch...."
3,Okay,"I rented this movie because I saw the preview for it and thought it would be good. And I guess I could say it was. But it was also very sad and depressing with a lot of death, though it was also very spiritual. But let me warn you if you don't like LONG, sad, gory movies, then it might not be the best to watch, if you don't want to ruin your nerves. I cried three times during the movie. And if you want your kids to watch it, they should be at least 10 or even 11 to watch it, because they won't understand it. You can give this movie a shot, but no one can guarantee that you'll like it."
2,2 1/2 stars at most,"The Last Sin EaterI absolutely loved Francine Rivers book ""The Last Sin Eater"" I am also aware that movies made from books are seldom as good as the novel; However this film was a mess. I am very disappointed because I bought the movie because the reviews on here were so good! If good correlates to the message then yes 5 stars to believing in something. However as a movie it really falls short. My main problem with the movie was the accents of the actors (very fake and painful to listen to). I also think if the viewer has not read the book they will not understand the movie (my family did not get the movie AT ALL). I would recommend you buy the book instead and save yourself 2 hours of confusing dialogue and poorly acted out scenes. If you still want to see it, rent it on blockbuster and save 15 bucks."
1,Truly Awful,"This is porn for the soul. Melodramatic, movie-of-the-week mumbo jumbo nonsense. If you have half a brain, avoid this tripe at all costs."
4,Very Good,"Very good movie about how devestating believing a lie can be,and how to forgive like a chirstian.A solid story sutible for teens and adults.Some parts might be considered scary for smaller children.They could have explained salvation a little better."
2,No match for earlier work with the Toiling Midgets,"While the angst here is appealing, the listener cannot help but be disappointed if s/he is familiar with Eitzel's work with the Toiling Midgets. Though Eitzel ended up leaving the progenitors of Sadcore with a great deal of bitterness and some unwarranted insults trailing behind him, he has yet to find backing capable of filling the void. Even his work with AMC, despite Tim Mooney of the Toiling Midgets on drums, is but a sad echo of his brief tenure as one of the many vocalists who have tried to integrate themselves into the sonic backdrop provided by Craig Gray's soul-rending guitar work."
4,Nice Verdi recital by Pavarotti,"All the selections on this recital disc all tailor-made for Pavarotti's beautiful voice except perhaps ""Celeste Aida"" where scoops perhaps a little bit too much. Even so, he sings an exquisite diminuendo on the high Bb at the end. Very enjoyable Verdi aria disc."
4,Aging Skin,My dermatologist recommended this lotion for use on my arms where the skin is very thin and tears easily. It certainly seems to help for me.
5,Cheap but good,Casio Men's EF305-1AV Multifunction Analog Watch realy worths the money you pay for. Great ratio of value and quality. I totally recommend it.
5,very cheap!,it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you.
3,Good inexpensive Watch,A comfortable and inexpensive watch that looks great. Have had the watch for over a month and haven't gotten a scratch on the glass which must means its good quality.
4,Great Value,"A great value, good looking watch.Slightly larger than it appears, but not oversized.Small dials a a bit difficult for us old fogeys to read, but like the other folks say, a terrific everyday watch.Recieved a bit earlier than predicted."
5,Top quality for not much cash,"Received the item this week and I'm very impressed with the quality. Very heavy face and heavy duty strap. Definately feels like a quality watch. Looks great too.. If I had one complaint, it would be that the strap comes off the face at less of an angle than I would like and it's not adjustable if that makes sense. So it feels a little tight or loose depending on where I have it set.Very happy though. Similar watches in Australia are 5 times the price."
2,good looking but...,only lasted 3 mths...at first thought the batt had gone dead however upon replacement same issue of no movement on either hands re-occurred.
3,Cluttered and heavy,"PROS- Solid look- Build qualityCONS- They're heavy for their size- Date and day of the week are tricky to read, almost useless (often covered by other arrows)- Bracelet might not be easily replaceableOVERALLOk if you want inexpensive Edifice.Otherwise you may consider alternatives..."
5,Awesome Watch ....,This is amazing watch from casio. it is easily mix up with any style. easy to operate and rubber belt and silver dial combination is makes it attractive.
4,Good inexpensive analog watch,"I like this watch a lot. It's pretty much just what I was looking for. Nothing fancy. I didn't want all the bells and whistles, just a good looking, easy to read, easy to set watch that keeps time and looks decent on my wrist. Only two small criticisms of this watch: (1) there's no backlight for reading it in the dark; (2) the date is pretty hard to read -- might not be a problem for younger folk with better eyes, but the dial for the date is so small that it's sometimes difficult to tell which number it's pointing to. All in all, though, this is a good watch and has not been a disappointment at all."
4,Great watch!,Purchased for my son for Christmas and he said he was happy he could wear it to work or when casual. He really likes it.
5,My opinion,"This watch is as good as I thought, It's working without problems, it's comfortable and beautiful, I'm glad that I bought this item."
2,I got one of this,I want to buy another one; but the oldie I got the wrist band is broke ( plastic) I tried to replace it but the cost was around $40.00 so I want to buy a new one.The little black dials doesnt work pretty much but i want just because it seems like good watch.enjoy!
2,You get what you pay for.,"While it's a smart looking watch, the functionality is poor. The date dial is extremely difficult to read and can only be set by rotating hour hands 720 degrees to advance the date by a single day! The other two smaller dials are essentially useless. With no lighting, you must depend on the faintly luminous hour and minute hands in the dark.A month after receiving the watch, I threw the box and directions away (necessary for a return) and the watch began to start and stop sporadically. I'd just throw it away, but I've got to figure out how to easily dispose of the mercury battery."
1,Stay away from this watch!,"OK, I bought the watch from Amazon figuring it was only $25 and that it looked pretty decent. I probably won't return it because... it was only $25 and that's not really worth the effort of returning. But after a couple of days of wearing it, I've set it aside and won't wear it again.Here's why:1) It's fat! Really really thick. Looks a little ridiculous. Feels heavy and out of place on my wrist2) It's way too complicated. Try to set it without the manual? Impossible. And why in the world do you have to set the hands separately from the digital display? That seems ridiculous to me, like there's a good reason to have the analog and digital displays show different time for most users? Lazy design.3) I'm not going to use most of the features, especially as they'd require me to carry the manual around with me.Now I know. For me, a watch needs to be thin, elegant, and simple. This is the opposite: fat, ostentatious, and complicated."
2,"good watch,very hard to see the smaller dials","i like many of you dont like a watch thats all plastic. and amazon needs to come up with better filtered search results. i searched through almost five thousand watches to find one that had an all metal stainless steel case. this one looked nice and what attracted me to it was the fancy extra dials. i wanted a watch that looked like it was expensive. a watch for dress occasions. the watch does not have a light to see it in the dark. which i believe it should have, the smaller dials are extremely hard to read, you almost need a magnifying glass to read them.5 stars for the fact that its all metal. 2 stars for the fact that it badly needs a light and the smaller dials are hard to see.overall, its a good analogue watch to have. and its metal, not resin plastic that the majority of watches are made of."
3,Different then expected,I thought the face would be bigger then it was. It was smaller then I expected. My husband likes it though!
4,Good inexpensive watch,I bought Casio Men's Multifunction Analog Watch last year. I was very satisfied with this inexpensive watch. All functions worked properly and sporty style. I prefer wear this watch rather than use a replica of expensive watch. Thanks
3,"Great, until it's battery replacement time","When it's time to replace the battery, one has to send it to a Casio authorized repair center, as doing it at a mall watch repair shop or jeweler will cause the watch to lose its water resistant properties. I did just that, and now the crystal gets condensation with any contact of moisture. As the original battery lasted 3+ years, considering the price of a replacement watch, the old one becomes a throwaway."
4,A great watch for the money,I love the watch and would recommend anyone to buy it. The best bang for your buck in this category.
3,decent watch - bad band design,"A bought this watch a while ago (1.5 years). Besides the small dials which took me too long to stare at to actually figure out what the date was, I thought the band was a little stiff and uncomfortable. Unfortuneately there is no generic band that will work. You have one choice - the same exact band. Casio blew it on this for me. My next watch will accept many band options before I buy it. Now besides the band not being that comfortable, it cracked. First the loop cracked off, then the band itself in two places. Now do I buy another band I'm not so thrilled with for $22? No way. The whole watch is now $28. I'll shop more now and keep this in mind next time I see a Casio that catches my eye."
5,Perfect for the price,"The watch is perfect for the price and I like it. It also has clear display and fits in confort. For $29, you can't go wrong."
4,Good buy,"This watch is attractive and a good buy. The only thing I would change is that if you have a large wrist, it is kind of tight and because of the band, it doesn't stretch."
4,Good watch but not great,This watch is good i've had it for about 2months now. I had a casio watch before with this same resin band but the band eventually got worn out and i had to replace it. If the resin band it wet repeatedly and not dried it's life would be significantly reduced. Despite all this the watch is great looking and can be worn both with formal and informal attire. Great buy.. a little too pricey ..but it's a casio.
3,No water resistance,"I bougth em on amazon on 11.2007. I decided to try cheap watch to understand do I really need em. First of all they looks good and more expensive then they are but I used em about 4 times in swimming pool and after that I found drops of water on the inner side of the glass. After that fluorescent paint on the arrows smeared alittle and now Iam really in doubt about water resistance of watch.They still looks good, movement is ok but I don't use them."
1,The Best Of Soupy Sales Show,"The best of SOUPY? Its sure no compliment to one of the greatest one liners to live. All this material had to be retrived from floor sweepings. Poor quality video, little or no editing.An insult to a great comedian. Save your money. The only reason it got a one, was for SOUPY."
2,"Exactly what did they mean by ""Best""?","Soupy Sales was one of the funniest guys on 60's TV, but you'd never know it from this short video. I loved his show as a kid. Maybe my memory overplays how good he was, but I still can't help feeling you give me a day with a few of his old tapes and I'll give you a better selection than this. Great show, poor clips."
1,Terrible!,"This dvd is a scam! Woody Woodpecker is in only one of the cartoons on the dvd! I will either get a refund and return the dvd, at the sellers expense, or I will stop payment with my credit card company. Do not order this dvd if you are looking for Woody Woodpecker cartoons."
2,Bad poor content,"The cartoons are not well made and boring,,, I own it and wont even sell it to save someone else the agravation,,, i might give it away to a child who still entertained by just looking at the characters and doesnt care about the story."
3,Woody Woodpecker,The dvd was okay the quality was not that great on the screen. My kids are really into Woody right now and that's why I ordered it but like I mentioned quality not to great
5,It's Worth Every Penny!!!,This is the BEST Woody Woodpecker DVD I've ever seen!!! Even the artwork on the cover is great!!! I bought 2 of them/1 for a friend.
4,Blurriness and Shadowing.,"This was a Christmas gift, and My Dad started watching it tonight. There is a lot of shadowing and blurriness on the first disk. I not sure about the quality of the other disk, but this is a diappointment. The first season was excellent but that quality is different on this one.Edited: DVD player was bad. Replaced that and the quality is fine."
4,virginian dvds,"These dvds were sent promply and effeciently. They arrived in the southern hemisphere safely and on time. We cannot comment on the quality as they are being saved for a rainy day, I am sure they are of top quality as all other aspects of this transaction have been."
4,good syncing product for pocket pc,"I liked this software better than the intellisync, I couldnt get intellisync to work with Act2000."
2,Quite the disappointment,"I bought this album after much searching on Amazon.The reason I hunted it down was that it had a song, ""Big Brass Ring"" which I originally heard on the Plagiarism album. I should have realised that along with the rest of the re-worked songs on that set, that the original would not sound at all familiar ... and it doesn't unfortunately.This is a rather poor effort for a band which is capable of high quality, humerous and often funky music."
1,Awful. So awful.,"I love Sparks, but this album is absolutely godawful. It has no personality at all! It could be by any faceless '80s dance-pop disaster. Thank God they found their muse again; their last several records have been incredible."
1,Totally Unoriginal,"This is totally unorginal and boring music. When I listened to this I thought, ""I have heard this kind of junk a million times already."" Look, these girls were put together by Lookout Records as a gimmick band: Girls who are like the Ramones! So what? The songs are predictable, boring, and all sound the same. I guess maybe it's appropriate for 12-year-old ""punks,"" but beyond that it's simply garbage."
5,"The best straight-up rock n' roll album sinse ""Ramones""","No kidding! Check it out,you'll agree with me.These kids blast out of the gate with the catchiest tunes and coolest attitude out there,and are a bracing antidote to all the homoginized pop product now glutting the airwaves.All the songs on ""Teenage Rock n' Roll"" are virtual classics,but for me the standouts are the title track,which could easily pass for a great lost Ramones rocker,as well as ""Checkin' It Out"",""Gimmie My Radio"",and the deliciously titled ""Leather on Leather"".These kids rock out with such effortless bravado and unself-concious rock n' roll spirit that they make other,more ""serious"" and ""authentic"" rock bands look like overblown bores in comparison.If you're lookin' for a platter to kick-start a party,help you blow off steam at your [...] job,play air-guitar to,or help you just get all the other boring music out there out of your head,then slap ""American Teenage Rock n' Roll"" on yer hi-fi and get ready to rock!"
1,Read this before you buy,"I gave this 1 star because it is the exact same gig as the VORTEX DVD. So don't buy both. It's a great DVD, but not worth screwing me over when I buy both (how can I return it? It's open). I think the post-production quality on the ""Live In Freiburg"" version is superior, so buy that one."
2,You get what you pay for...,"A terrible book! The writing is poor, the illustrations are unhelpful, and the information is old. Don't get it. Instead, visit the USRA web page for tips and stuff. Also, I do recommend the book, Winning Racquetball, by Turner. You are warned!"
4,hank williams covers and r&b by charlie rich,"this import cd has twelve tracks of charlie rich covering hank williams - an excellent rocking rendition of ""hey, good lookin'."" an even better treat is the r&b sessions charlie did for the same label - ""hi records."" included is the excellent ""i'll shed no tears,"" as well as ""pass on by,"" and ""hurry up freight train."" charlie rich did great r&b and soul - this is an excellent cd."
1,A major ripoff. Don't buy it!!,"This is flat-out false advertising on part of the producers of this DVD. It has NOTHING to do with Christmas or the holiday season at all, despite the cover graphics showing Christmas tree lights, holly, etc. Some idiot who obviously feels that a few cartoons which partly include skating or snow in them makes this a ""Christmas"" cartoon ought to be fired. Most of the cartoons on the DVD don't even have that.I got ripped off purchasing this DVD believing what the cover represented would be the content of the material. Don't make the same mistake and avoid this DVD or video!!"
2,"A Real Holiday ""Snow Job""!","Unlike the recent DVD releases of Tom and Jerry cartoons, this one is a real let down. First of all, it IS NOT holiday oriented. Secondly, as all lovers of animated know, the quality of cartoons began to drop severely during the late sixties with spaced out framing and poor animation. This DVD is of the late sixties vintage and not very impressive. Amazing, as MGM has a vault of Tom and Jerry cartoons that could have made this a real holiday treasure. Instead, we have been given a few late vintage cartoons that have poor story, animation, and ""hip"" graphics that detract from the pleasure derived from the vintage cartoons that were so well made. Pass it up unless you are a severe die-hard Tom and Jerry fan."
1,dissatisfied with seller,"I never received the item purchased. Never ever was notified of any problem with the item being available. Amazon refunded my purchase amount quickly, so I would use Amazon again but not purchase anything from this specific seller."
1,Total Bomb.,"I bought this dvd of Tom,and Jerry at Walmart a year,or 2 ago,from the $5.00 bind! Being a Baby boomer i have Always loved the cartoons from the 1940s-1970s,But this was a total bomb last night when i finally after all this time opened it up to watch some of my new Christmas shows from last year,and beyond that i have Never watch yet.Save your money! Don't buy this,at any price! I'll give mine away at the thrift store here in town..Junk. Monday December 24th.2012 @ 6.29 pm cst usa."
2,Dont waste your time... Not a christmas one,"I have no idea why this is titled holiday, there is a quasi holiday 10 min bit in it, but thats it. Th best cartoon is the first one, the rest are horrible."
1,Don't bother.,Don't bother paying money for this. The cartoons are the same classic ones that people love but they don't have anything to do with holidays. They are also in terrible shape. You'd get better quality just waiting and watching them when someone plays them on tv.
4,Good Wireless Adapter,"I had one of these already, so I knew it was a good one. I use it on two desktop computers. It sure beats wires going all over the house. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I don't really know if there is something better out there. But for $10 you can't best it."
1,Encore enuwi g3 wireless adapter,"I'm sad with this enuwi that i got from you.. At the start i said it has a good signal but after 1 week, its worst, imagine 20mins had passed n until now it has no signal.. I dont know whst is happening with this wireless adapter... U know what? I am doing this review thru the help of my iphone... If not from my iphone i cannot open my email n surfing the net... Sorry but its true"
5,"A great deal, works perfectly","This is a great, cheap, USB Wifi adapter. I've owned it for a month now, and I've had no problems whatsoever. It works well, and has never dropped my connection.I've tested it on WinXP, but did not use the included drivers, since I read that they were no good. Instead, I used the drivers found on the Realtek (the chipmaker)'s website. Go to [...], and search for 8187B to get the better drivers.I also tested it on Ubuntu 9.10, and it worked out-of-the-box, no problems at all.As noted by one of the other reviewers, this is a Wireless-G adapter, NOT Wireless-N.In short: Works perfectly with the right drivers, cheap, no complaints."
2,Don't buy this.,"When I got a computer for my bedroom, I realized that it would be extremely inconvinent to run an ethernet cable from the router to there so I googled around and bought this on newegg. This was the first wifi adapter I ever had and it worked great for a month. Then it started randomly working off and on, and somehow the case fell off of it. A week after the case fell off of it, the usb plug and the device itself broke apart(I accidently touched it and got quite the shock). For the time it did work, it worked fine. After this I bought a $5 one on ebay, its case fell off too. I'm now going to spend the money to buy a nice one, but for those going the cheap route don't get this one."
2,Beautiful Shoe/Cheaply made,"The shoe looks beautiful, but when you receive it, the part of the shoe that fits around your heel, or the very back of your foot does not provide any suppport. It is soft like fabric where it should be stiff. It almost feels as if it is going to fold or fall down."
1,Don't waste your money,Choreography was very disappointing. Black eye peas were wandering on stage like headless chickens. One of the worst DVD on the market.
4,this ivan is terrible,"beautiful costumes, effective sets, and superb dancing, but the lighting was not properly prepared for filming. it may have been porpusely left that way to emphasize it's dark theme but i wasn't happy at all to watch this production that i found it gloomy and the picture was not as crisp as shown in the cover and in the booklet, it felt like watching an old video tape.wonderful performance though, throughout, non-stop dancing, breathtaking jumps; the ladies in the corps, and synchronized acting of the men.& to those who are not familiar to this ballet, like me, i'll just tell you that the dancing is something like what you'll get when you put a show together between le noces and othello. with the same dramatic score.i only gave this 4 star because i think it wasn't prepared professionaly for dvd, it just marginalizes the idea that dvd films have crystal clear pictures, and the this ivan production tried it terribly. 5 stars for all the stars of paris opera though."
1,Shipment Never Arrived,"These balls were recommended to my class by our yoga instructor. This brand and no other. So I ordered enough for the class. There was some issue with the shipping, which after talking to the company, they had reason to believe all or many of their shipments were incorrect that day. I called days after shipment should have arrived. The customer service representative was great, but couldn't do much. The lost product was now out of stock and then backordered. After waiting another week and a half (and getting flack from my class), I called back and the items were now backordered because their stock didn't arrive on time. I asked for and easily received a refund, but that didn't help my case.Moral of the story - apparently it is a great product, but the company has some logistics to iron out. Pay attention to the quantities and ""arrive by"" dates."
2,Get the real Bender Ball,Would have been nice if it came with a couple photo instructions on what exercises to do with it.
3,"as advertised, great shipping, ball deflates pretty easily","This ball is NOT for anyone who has had back problems..........EVER!, It also deflated on my hubby pretty easily!"
5,"9"" Mini Ball","I am very satisfied with my purchase. This 9"" ball is the right size for doing crunches comfortably. The ball is made out of a material that sticks to the floor and doesn't roll around) as you workout. This product was priced well and delivered quickly."
4,Mini-ball,"This ball is great. I had relatively strong abs but not really any definition. I need to do at least 100 situps before I can feel the burn and that takes a lot of time and is uncomfortable. With the ball I do less sit-ups and my abs are becoming more defined. I don't use it all the time so I can't attest to weight loss, but it does work well on your abs for definition."
3,Good,It's good for lower ab work. Your on the floor which feels like a regression from my other exercises on the large ball.
3,Sticky ball...,"This ball does perform the purpose for which it was intended. I bought it for use as a yoga ball and it performs adequately in that role. (It comes in a little plastic sack with a plastic tube to blow it up with, which is easy to use and works quite well.) My main caveat is that the ball material is sticky. One reviewer said she was able to solve this problem by washing the ball in hot, soapy water. I washed mine but the ball still feels sticky. This is not just an aesthetic problem, it makes moving the ball around during exercise poses more difficult because it doesn't want to slide, it wants to stick to your clothing. Bottom line: if I had this purchase to do over again, I'd try to find a ball made of a different material, but since I already have it, I use it."
4,Great purchase!,I am a fitness instructor and needed pilates balls to use with my students. These balls work perfectly! They are made of a slightly grippy material that the students love and the size of the ball can be larger or smaller depending on how much I inflate them. The packaging smell was noticeable at first but now it is fine. The balls do deflate over time but I find that inflating them is super easy and fast! Great purchase!
2,Wish I could Leave a 5,"I wish I could leave a good review, but this pilates ball is not durable. The first workout I used it for was great. It really did help me focus on core muscles, unfortunately my 5 year old daughter really tested it for me. After one good bounce on the ball it popped beyond repair. I understand that these balls are not meant for this kind of abuse, but I did feel a little uncomfortable using it for exercise at my weight. I really don't want to spend $13 every time a little too much pressure is applied. I've bought exercise balls at Walmart that could put up with more."
2,"Pilates Ball, just OK","The ball works as it is supposed to and it is certainly cheaper than the Bender Ball. Kind of silly how you have to blow it up with a straw( I used a pump from other balance balls) and it always deflates a little when you place the pin. Actually, a children's plastic ball that you buy at the supermarket works just as well and costs a whole lot less."
5,PIlates Ball,This is a great price and the quality is comparable to the more expensive pilates balls that I have used. Great deal.
3,It's okay.,"While the title intrigued me, the book has not been what I expected (I'm only 3/4 of the way through so far). While there are definitely some tidbits worthy of ""highlights,"" (I particularly liked chapter 5), I have also been confused by some things and wonder if I actually believe some of what John writes (parts of chapters 6, 11, 12, 15). But, it has stimulated me to think on some things and that's always a good thing, to be challenged to think what you believe and be firmed up in it."
4,A good pastoral devotional,"Well, I'll keep this short and simple. This book reads like a devotional (probably developed for the busy pastor in mind). This is a great strength for it. It isn't meant to be some heady tomb in which you have to slave over. It's quick, succinct and to the point.What it does (I think) is trying to rekindle that passion you have at the onset of ministry work. Piper is trying to get us back to a biblical model and mode whereby we are more focused on Christ and less on business models, fads, or the whatnots of the day.So pick this book up for a pastor of yours and just remember to encourage those people who minister in your lives.//It also includes a really good chapter on baptism (believers') which should help us all come charitably to points at which we disagree.Great book - easy read!"
4,Smart approach!,"The ministry of John Piper has been a blessing to me. He truly has a passion for the supremacy of God, and it shows in this volume to those of us in pastoral ministry.Get this volume with delight and apply as much as you can. I promise, you will be a better man for God. Thank you, Piper."
2,Not so radical,"Don't get me wrong, this book has plenty of good stuff in it. However, it is hardly an exhortation to for radical pastoral ministry that departs from a professional mentality. I kept reading this book anticipating I'd eventually read something radical... but never did. Because of this, reading the book was often very painful. Because of this, I rate it as low as I do with only 2 stars.As Leonard Ravenhill? said: we would not think many ministers to be great if they were not announced to us as so. Fact of the matter is, many would not think this book to be ""radical"" if it were not presented to us as so.Very little of this book even really touches on the issue of ""professionals."" Nothing really radical here. Some good exhortations in general, but there are better. Don't give amazon.com your money for this book."
5,One of the best sci-fi stories ever not just in anime,"This is one of the best sci-fi stories ever, not just in anime. The political intrigue, philosophies around the story, and action are the perfect combination. The suspense builds through the season to a can't stop watching pace. The standalone episodes in between the main storyline are of the same exceptional quality and memorable in their own right. If you like sci-fi, anime, and/or the Ghost setting, you owe it to yourself to buy this product."
3,"Great series, shame about the subs","This is a great series, like some other reviewers this anime touched me on an emotional, intellectual and philosophical level.Unfortunately alot of the original character and depth of the series is lost in the english through the subtitles and dubbing.Anyone who really wants to experience it as the makers intended should seek out the Laughing Man Fansub version available on the internet. This was released by a Japanese native speaker who is also fluent in english.The fansubber captured far more than the official subs/dubs ever could, keeping the Japan specific euphamisms and metaphors intact explaining them with on screen text. LMF also overlays english over japanese text for signs and captions which goes a long way to helping continuity and understanding.The official dubs and subs gloss over so much in an attempt to simplify things, which for a series with such an intellectual leaning is sad."
1,Nice pic on the cover doesn't make up for lousy sound....,"A WARNING for the intended purchaser! This cd is a virtual duplicate of the 2004 release ""An Evening With Dionne Warwick:live in concert featuring the Bacharach & David songbook"". This l only discovered to my dismay after it arrived via Amazon. Only differs by one song; on this cd: 'Love Song', ""On An Evening With...has Corcovado instead. Worse still, the sound quality on "" Golden Legends is downright muddy. All in all, not worth the few $$$ asked for. Thus my recommendation: DEFINITELY purchase ""An Evening With Dionne Warwick"", but steer well clear of the cd ""Golden Legends: Dionne Warwick Live."
2,"Very good music, but NOT an SACD/Hybrid","Music: Great, 4 stars.Audio quality: Very good Redbook CD.Amazon listing accuracy: Fail, 0 stars. This is NOT an SACD/Hybrid release. After purchasing it and receiving a standard Redbook CD, I searched high and wide only to conclude that I don't think it was ever released as an SACD or Hybrid disc.Buy it for the music, but know you're probably getting a Redbook CD. In the end, 4 stars for music, zero for listing accuracy = two stars average. And as I've learned, do your homework before clicking 'purchase.'"
3,Great magazine - horrible subscription dept. harassment!,"Just like the other reviewer mentioned, the Mailbox magazine is a good source for the occasional great classroom idea. However, they were warning me it was time to renew right after I got my first issue with almost the whole year left in my subscription. The renewal request flurry escalated to phone calls every week that continued up until I finally demanded they stop calling me. Given that my school may ask me to go up or down in grade-level classroom instruction for next year, how would I know to which magazine I should subscribe that far in advance anyway?If you don't mind all the renewal notices and calls, it's a good source of ideas, especially when you need something in a hurry."
1,Avoid the harassment: don't buy it here,"I was going to buy this as a gift, but after reading the reviews I have decided it's not worth the spam and daily phone calls. However, I searched around some more and found out that Amazon sells this for the exact same price as retail (even though they claim you are saving money off some higher price). So, if you want to avoid the harassment but pay the same price, buy it directly from the distributor but use a fake phone number and a throw-away email address. That's what I may do."
5,The Best,I don't usaly read American manga but this one is really good. It is one of those books that you can read over and over again. I really recomend this book.
4,A Constitutional History of Secession,"The author does an outstanding job of setting forth the historical context of basis for the right of secession, going especially back into the history of England, from which we inherited most of our law and legal thought. However, at the same time, he probably spends too much time on the English history that gave our forefathers the basis for their decisions in the formation of our independent states which gave birth to the national government. Perhaps more space could have been devoted to the intermost thoughts of our founders. It is unfortunate that very few Americans have been taught the truth of the right of secession that our founders reserved to the states and how many of the warnings by some of the federalists about national government power have become true, which beganconsistent movement with the Civil War."
2,Interesting History - Weak on conclusions,"Mr. Graham provides much interesting history starting in the British Isles but after hundreds of pages showing how might makes right he suddenly concludes that the South was wronged because of their military defeat. Further, Mr. Graham brushes off the issue of slavery when in fact slavery was nearly the entire cause of the Civil War and was instrumental in Southern support for the Revolutionary War, as Southern Aristocrats correctly saw the coming end to slavery within the British Empire."
2,"Despite the previous reviews, this book is seriously flawed","Even though this book is well written, the author made conclusions that were unsupported by the facts. The Constitution of the United States of America specifically states in a number of places that no state or citizen can form another nation without the consent of the Congress, if at all. By concluding that Southern secession was Constitutional, the author loses credibilty. There are other ways to ""justify"" the secession that led to the Civil War, but the Constitution is not one of them."
4,Very good,"Very good book. I highly recommend it. This book helped my family tremendously. However, check out the prices in the book store first. I found out later that the copy I bought was VERY overpriced."
3,"Great, but one caution....","This book helped me stress less about my daughter's eating, and I think that's healthy for both of us. It is full of generally good sense. One concern I had was that there is no mention of the risk of low iron and anemia in babies who don't eat much in the way of solids. If your child has other risk factors for low iron (ie. fast growth, prematurity, low birth weight, exclusive breastfeeding (which is a very good thing, despite this risk)) you might want to talk to your doctor and consider getting them tested."
4,So that's why kids won't eat vegi's!,"A wonderful book about child nutrition that puts the topic in perspective. The parent's job is to provide nutritious food and the child's job is to eat. Problems come when you try to do each other's jobs. This is not another lecture about how you are a bad mommy if your child doesn't eat vegi's, he really answers the question and takes the pressure off both parent and child."
3,German hard rock band Victory's third studio album,"Another good hard rock album by Victory similar in style to there first two albums, this album would be the last album with Charlie Huhn of Foghat and Ted Nugent fame on lead vocals until the 2003 reunion album, a performance in support of this album was recorded for there live album ""That's Live"" that came out in 1988, this album is hard to find but well worth picking up."
2,texas hold em crap shuffler,"Waste of money. The card shuffler works, most of the time anyway. Its not worth the price! It feels like it will break very easily."
2,Tori Gate Charm,Very cheap & flimsy looking for sterling silver.Had to replace attached ring (broke when attached to bracelet).Would NOT have purchased if actually seen.
5,Excellent!!!!,"This is an excellent book. Nicole Bailey-Williams is truly a gifted writer. If you had the opportunity to read her first novel, and enjoyed it as much as I did, you definitely want to pick up a copy of ""Floating"". The author is a great writer and storyteller and she did an excellent job with character development in her sophomore effort. Nicole is a rising star in the literary scene."
2,Compilation of Research,"I have a 13 month old who is still babbling, and turned to this book for direction with her language development. While I found some of the information interesting, it is mostly a compilation and description of all of the relevant research associated with language development. There were a lot of examples and (unnecessary) visual aids, but nothing that really gave me the insight I was looking for (i.e. how to aid her in attaining this milestone). Basically, they proved that there is nothing specific one can do and that children will begin talking when they are ready. I wish I had simply read the summary first, as it would have saved me a lot of time!"
2,D-DAY on BD,since WWII came out on BD I Guess everbody's trying to do the same. TIMELESS media BD's look no better on BD than top quality standard DVD's. Buyer beware of spending extra for BD war doc. The only purpose of using BD is they put more on BD than DVD. Quanity over quality I guess.
1,Long list of problems,"This DVD release is mastered from a VHS dub copy of a 16mm dupe print, so no wonder the sound is horribly distorted (as many have pointed out), and the detail of the picture is washed out. You can see the squiggly videotape artifacts from the minute the opening credits start. In brighter scenes, you can barely see any detail of some of the characters' faces (this is evidence that the original source was a dupe of a positive print rather than a positive print made from a negative) and this probably explains the poor sound as well. Then, the dub to videotape further degraded the quality. If Alpha Video couldn't come up with better source material, they should've passed on this title. Considering this film's obscurity, I wasn't expecting miracles, but this is one of the worst DVD releases I've come across. Avoid."
2,No ending,"There were two reasons I bought this DVD, one being that I'm very interested in ""Sideshow Freaks"", so I really wanted to see the sisters. The other that I really wanted to know how they would punish the other sister in the movie.But there is no ending, there's just a man that simply tells you that you have to decide for yourself what you think the punishment should be.Very dissapointing!The acting isn't very good, especially not the sisters. The blonde one sounds bored when she should say ""I'm so happy!"".The good parts were the performances on stage, I especially thought the guy on the bicicle was cool.The sisters singing is good, it's so sad that the sound quality was so bad!The plot was good, even though the sisters didn't act good, it did told how hard it can be to always be stuck together."
2,The sound...arrrgghh....,"To the voyueristic among you yearning for a peep at the sex life of siamese twins, don't believe the hype on the box. Sizzleless exploiter featuring the Hilton sisters (of Freaks fame), posed as a courtroom drama centering on wether a judge can sentence both sisters for a murder only one comitted. Yes, there's the obligitory square up at the end, as silly as any of em. The dream sequence is sufficeintly weird, with Daisy being stunt doubled except for her close ups peeking through the tree. Oh, and there's a bumbling plate juggler, an organ played by rifle shots and a blind preacher waxing boringly about nature not ""granting favors"". The Hiltons sing a few songs. Besides that, the sound is atrocious and the print ain't much butter...er, better. Intrigued by this film after seeing Freaks? So was I. It didn't fail to disappoint. Not a total disaster, but not really worthwhile either."
4,Wonderful Hilton Sisters EPIC!!!!!,"Well maybe not epic, but very amusing and CHEAP!!The Hilton Sisters (looking considerably older than in FREAKS) star in this bizarre overly long murder film where one of the sisters commit murder, but no one can decide how to punish the murderess since her and her sister are attached at the hip.Definately a fun old cheesy flick, filled to the brim with ancient vaudeville style acts that usually preceed the The Hilton Sisters singing some kind of schtick.Some of the dialogue in this film is delivered so woodenly that you wonder what the heck Daisy and Violet were taking. Maybe it should be called ""Dosed For Life"".Also worth noting is that this DVD from ALPHA has the absolute worst SOUND quality I've ever heard. RHINO'S older VHS release sounds much better.The sound quality really is SO BAD that it can hardly be watched at all. Pure TORTURE."
5,Good Taste Gone Bad,"What happens when one of a pair of conjoined sisters (played by the real-life Hilton twins who were also in Tod Browning's Freaks) falls in love with a cad? Why, jealousy and murder, of course!! But who committed the murder? How do you punish the guilty party when you would also have to throw the innocent sister into jail? What does one twin do while the other one is on a date? These questions and more are addressed in this amazing film which will leave your jaw hanging down to knee level.Unfortunately, the film has little plot and is filled with a lot of padding, but where else will you see a film about jealousy and murder starring real conjoined twins?"
5,Can't Go Wrong with Little Big Book Series,"I always enjoy this series of books. Contains a variety of creative genres suitable for different interests e.g. stories, poetry, recipes, etc."
5,Innocent sensuality,"Mr. Murrian has created a work that belongs in the collection of every afficianado of the human form. He subjects are young and beautiful, but oblivious to their nudity. Their relaxed poses appear so natural that the viewer almost forgets their nudity as well--a remarkable achievement by Mr. Murrian and his models. The settings are dreamlike, the lighting and focus are right on, given the effect he was trying to achieve: innocence and sensuality. I liked his use of a blurred focus. I see other reviewers think he went overboard, but I think it's the perfect approach to achieve the mood of this book."
4,Great but not all Reanna,"I thoroughly enjoyed the pictures in the book. I was a little disappointed, however, to find out that not all of the pictures were on Reanna. I did not see that anywhere in the description, so I assumed that they were all of her. Instead, there are eight models that are featured, and Reanna is only one of them. Still, though, I found it very enjoyable."
1,no crystals!!!,"I thought this gum would be like the type I purchased when I was a kid, but I was wrong! It was not very sour and it is not filled with crystals! Soooooo disappointed!"
4,Pink Ribbons,"It is a thorough cultural critique of pink culture and pinkwashing with gloomy picture of American conformism and inclination to be brainwashed without questioning.What I wish was included in the film was some guidence as to what to do on an individual basis to bring social and medical change. How best to avoid breast cancer, in the face of environmental hazards.I wish the film went that extra step."
3,Bad ground but easy to fix.,"I purchased this adapter so I could do some crazy stuff with my rc car (like add a helicopter gyro and a ducted fan on the back), so I was expecting to do some modifying, but not on the adapter itself. However, I quickly had issues with the wires.A quick check with my DVOM and a little finessing with a small screwdriver, and I managed to find a bad ground wire. When the two wires were crimped, there was insulation in the way, blocking the connection, so a little solder fixed that problem.After that, I didn't have any issues, but a wire isn't really complicated anyways, so I wouldn't have expected any problems. Hence the educational value, because I learned that even something simple can need a little fixing.That said, it worked fine in the end, although I would have bought this elsewhere if anyone else had these in stock.Also, a ducted fan on an rc car is a bad idea, because it makes way too much noise and slowly destroys itself as it sucks in dirt."
4,Phillips Media Player,"So far I've found the Phillips Media player to be great! One disadvantage is that you have to convert YouTube videos to jpeg with a second software application before converting them to the player, but this isn't that much trouble. Nice product!"
2,not large enough,these arent large enough for a swaddling blanket. i prefer the hospital versions over any.
2,Nah!,"This product is definately not worth it's weight. I'd much rather purchase HP brand name ink cartridges. They can be redeemed at my local office supply store for a one dollar credit per cartridge. These aftermarket ones can't. Plus, their electronic tabs can be unreliable."
3,Is Sparkler a Pillow Pal??,I would like to see a picture of the swing tag as well as the tush tag. Books list 48 Pillow Pals. I have found 50! No Sparkler!
5,EXCELLENT LITTLE CAMERA,I really enjoy my 110S. I like a camera that does the thinking for me.This has the Active AutoFocus system which really works great; and the zoom is superior and easy to operate. Go from a panoramic to close-ups with ease. Anytime Flash system picked the right setting indoors and out; without any redeye.The viewfinder helps you center your subject and the LED tells you when to focus and the setting is correct. don't know about the other review who panned this little gem but mine is one of the best camera's I've ever had
2,It was not good camera for me,"I tried 2 rolls of film (one 400 and another 800 speed) with this camera. I got about 10 good quality picture (not excellent) and others were bellow average. I returned this camera after that.This camera feels and looks excellent, but I need camera for pictures..."
5,boots,my grandaughter loved these boots. saw them in new york cith andjust had to have them.she says they are very comfortable
3,"A new, remixed version of ""Collection"" ... you can skip this.","Remember a few years ago when Madacy released ""The Juice Newton Collection"" and instead of the actual hit versions of the songs, fans were subjected to terribly produced versions of her hits? Well, this is the new version of that (but this new version has fewer songs).Some of the versions here are alternate to the new versions from ""Collection,"" but just like the previous release, this music is unevenly mixed (although it was improved slightly from the previous release, which buried the vocals completely). Sounds like these recordings are from the same sessions as the Collection ones.Juice Newton's voice is awesome, and she deserves better recordings than this. In fact, this is the only really bad recoird she's released since the mid-70s. Let's hope juice's next recordings are of new songs and are well-produced."
4,Worthy collection,I found this book to be a useful compendium of essays that are usually scattered or incompletely represented in anthologies. It's an excellent supplement for a course on Eliot's work or to learn more about his critical perspectives and how they shifted over time. Very worthwhile.
5,very nice quality!!!!,"fast ship and nice quality . it is a very new and clean book, the same as picture.thanks you!"
3,Not so good,"Yes, the idea is nice: to have the kanji ordered from the most frequent down to the less used. The book covers only the first 500 kanji (which leaves appart several important characters) but makes a good starting point. The kanji are hand-written. This is not bad in itself because it could be considered useful for approaching the way in which they appear in real life situations. However, the quality of printing is terrible. Complicated kanji are illegible and then imposible to recognize, particularly for the beginner. Also, the low-quality paper does not help much in this sense. All in all, too expensive for what you get. Browse a little more before buying this one.By the way, I came into this book driven by the fierce advice from a kanji-study web page. The site is also the only source for the book..."
2,A few good tracks..,"5 Stars for Duke. Minus 4 stars for remastering (or lack of). The material is the cream of the crop Ellington, but the people who remastered this tried to get too much clarity and the end result is distortion. Definitive releases are usually a good bargain but this is a complete waste of money.Buy the ""Never No Lament"" compilation. It's also has suffered the overuse of the original masters but it's the best you can get.Where's JT Davies on this one? RCA probably would let him near these recordings 'cause then we'd have affirmation that most remastering is pretty average.Add One star for the tracks here that are Columbia issues and they are impossible to find elsewhere(Hello Columbia...not everyone wants the Complete... And how about issuing the late 40's/Early 50's seperately?).Also Mr JB Blues and a couple other Blanton duets are here and difficult to find elsewhere.Dave Wilson"
3,Disappointing......,"I read ""Torchlight"" right before i read this book and had only one problem with it- it ended abruptly leaving you with unanswered questions. I found the same problem in this book ""The Bridge"".""The Bridge"" did not have a plot that drew me into the book, in fact, i only finished the book because i can never leave anything unfinished. The storyline flip-flopped between the two characters leaving the reader confused.But as before the main problem with Mrs. Bergren's work is the abrupt ending. Althougth this book had a epilogue it dealt with a unimportant topic and still left many question unanswered.Overall, i would not recommend this book to anyone nor would i ever read it again."
3,A somewhat dull read.,"While I love LTB's Northern Light Series, I found her latest to be a bit uninteresting. There isn't much action except at the beginning all inspired by Gary Chapman's song. Love the song. But I think I'll pass on the book. It's a time-filler, though, and I'm looking forward to her next..."
4,If u like GREEN DAY,"Definately a great album for any 15 fan. The music is great and tight. There are a numerous amount of songs on this album, and each sound very similiar to the next. The big turnoff is Jeff Ott's voice on the album (Billie Joe/Green Day) wich is a big turnoff to any non-greenday fan. All in All, a must for any fan. CRIMPSHRINE was a much better punk band. R.I.P"
4,Captivating,"A very good plot and a captivating hero and heroine. Very unusual and refreshing to find a heroine so advanced in age (28!!). I got a little impatient at the end when it takes Ivan so long to come around -- 4 months!! -- but overall a very touching story, with some realistic elements you don't often find in romance novels. The supporting characters were very well done, and I would also love to hear more about Elliot Pierce!"
2,Gimme a break!,"Gimme a break! It was slow in the beginning, good in the middle and down right painful in the end! Ms. Becnel does a good job with a plausable romance as far as the characters go in the beginning. But by the end of the book there is no way she would continue to love him. He abandons her completely and she keeps making excuses for him. He never makes amends. Finally on the last page he admits his love, but never truly apoligizes for disrespecting her and hurting her. Plus the heroine is supposed to be so outspoken that she could never find a man to truly love. When she finally does fall in love with this difficult man, she becomes spineless. She lets him walk all over her. Not to mention the terrible ending that's supposed to be a tear-jerker and ends up being just stupid. Not even that event caused him to tell her he loved her. What a waste of time."
5,Great Book,I am a teacher in the field of Wild Foods. I first purchased this book over twenty years ago and still consider it the best book on the subject...so far. Well researched with authentic information.
4,Heroine initally hard to relate to but overall a fast & fun read,"I found Christine a little hard to empathize with; However, I began to appreciate her personality and drive by the end of the book.The description of Silver Mountain reminded me so much of winter ski trips and perfectly described the festive feeling in tourist ski towns. I actually felt like I was skiing the slopes and sitting by the fire with Chris and Alec! And the descriptions of them dancing together are HOT!"
4,Sweet story,"I started reading Ortolon because there was a free book...now I've bought the other two in the series and am on book 3 of another one of her trilogies. Funny characters, short reads, great romance. I like Ortolon's style."
3,It's ok,"It was ok. There were a few promising moments then they were shattered by the heroine's issues. Held on and finished but took a bit, just couldn't get into it."
2,Leave the sex out,There was too much descriptive sex in the book. I don't need this kind of filth. A book doesn't need explicit sex to be good.
4,Just Perfect,Another wonderful book by Julie Ortolon - I loved how she has three stories for these three school friends. I love happy endings.
1,Terribly misleading,"A more accurate family guide to homeopathy can be found in Ernst & Singh (Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine), Goldacre (Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks) or Park (Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud). The fraudulent nature of homeopathy was exposed in 1842 by Oliver Wendell Holmes (Homeopathy and its Kindred Delusions) and not one of those faults has been remedied since.For homeopathy to be right, everything we know about the nature of matter must be not just wrong but spectacularly wrong. The science that contradicts homeopathy is the science that makes your GPS and cellphone work. Lasers work, therefore homeopathy can't. It really is that simple!"
2,"Typeface small, hard to read","One word of caution, the typeface is small and not pleasing to the eye. I returned the book because it was difficult to read."
5,"Service, Quality & Price, Great",Great book and price! Quality is top of the line! Every home should have this book.
2,The quality is not very good,I recommend that you buy one of the following instead:more money: looney toons golden collectionless money: asinB00063QD6G classic cartoons DVDThe other ones are longer and better and the sound is not out of sync.
1,Don't Waste your Money On this one,"~* I really agree with the other reviewer !!The quality is really bad & the packaging was extremely cheap! I took a gamble on this one, because I didn't see any reviews posted here and knew nothing about this DVD.I purchased it at the time Warner Brothers was releasing the Looney Tunes Golden Box set!! So i was on a cartoon kick !! Had a read even one bad review I would have saved my money !This really just isn't worth spending money on, my dvd is just laying there in the back of my Cabinet :)"
4,Totally original and hilarious satire on health care,"This is a 'must have' for anyone who's into blues/r&b/comedy/healthcare...in other words, everyone! Great lyrics that will have you howling and music that will satisfy blues and r&b aficionados. This is a truly original set craftily put together by Dr. Sam. Take it with you to the doctor's office and when he gives you the bill, give him the CD!Linda and Mark (Nashville TN)"
4,Review by David Bennett,"As Internet availability continues to grow and access is obtained at much faster speeds, e-business is becoming the norm rather than a novelty. This book is therefore timely as it recognizes the importance of web architecture in delivering services and information more efficiently through the electronic media."" - Dr. David Bennett, Professor of Technology Management, Aston University, UK"
2,Riding on ... dull,"I'm not a navy veteran or military history scholar, but I've read quite a few books on U.S. and British ships in World War II. Good ones include ""Tin Can Sailor"" and ""The Cruel Sea"" -- NOT ""Riding on Luck"". Its flowery writing is a bit too ""rah-rah, here we go!"" and doesn't back it up with compelling prose. The author tells you it was exciting, but doesn't show you -- not surprising since he wasn't there. Knight, the son of a Lang sailor, manages to make even cruises with FDR aboard boring and dull, and he fails to describe the destroyer in any real detail. The author provides a backdrop of the war while the Lang is at sea, and I found these explanations a nice try, but overly simplistic. The last straw was bad grammar, dropped words and other printing errors."
5,Northwest Passage,"I can't give any of Stan Roger's albums less than 5 stars. This might only be my 3rd favorite album after Fogarty's Cove and Home in Halifax, but it has 3 outstanding tracks that really stay in my mind over time, Free in the Harbour, Idiot, and Northwest Passage."
4,Right on,"This is an awesome CD. Stan Rogers has a great voice, I love the Celtic-inflected instrumentals, and his ballads speak authentically to working-class Canadian life."
5,Another great purchase through an Amazon Partner.,I love this product. Have been using it for 7 months now and still works and looks great.Thanks for helping me create the bathroom of my dreams!
3,da last house party i am ever going 2 watch and attend,this party was getting old because kid and play r now old well in their 20s they don't have enough time 2 fool around and getting into trouble like da first 2 films and tisha campbell isn't in da entire film but chris tucker and benmae mac were very funny u get guess star appearacne from tlc and immature da fourth one i didn't bother watching because it didn't have kid and play because they are now in their 30s too old so but i do see is da r and b group immature not so immature and other people that didn't do anything 2 get my attention of watching this film this was da final house party movie that i watched because of da late cool kid and play and what happened 2 big ear martin l he was surpose 2 b here i saw his replacement which was a guy that almost look like him but had an enough bigger mouth than him but he was kinda of funny Joe Brown
2,IT'S GETTIN OLD NOW,"THIS TIME, KID GETS ENGAGED, AND HE THROWS A BACHELOR PARTY AT HIS HOUSE. MY QUESTION IS WHO CARES? KID N PLAY HAD GOTTEN PLAYED OUT AS RAPPERS BY THE TIME THIS MOVIE CAME OUT. THE ONLY FUNNY MOMENTS COME FROM BERNIE MAC AND REYNALDO REY. I WAS GONNA GIVE THIS ONE JUST 1 STAR, BUT AFTER SEEING HOUSE PARTY 4, I DECIDED TO CHANGE IT TO 2 STARS. BUT STILL, AVOID THIS TRASHY SEQUEL."
2,It just keeps getting worse and worse,"I first said that this movie was better than House Party 2, but boy, was I wrong. The only saving grace to this movie was Bernie Mac. Immature had some okay moments in here too, but the whole House Party movie theme was becoming stale by the time 1994 rolled around. And the jokes were just awful."
4,cellist shines,"This is a CD which features both expressive and bland playing. It is obvious that cellist Julie Albers is one of the up and coming young artists of our age. With a rich, beautiful tone, mature phrasing and brilliant technical facility, she easily steals the spotlight. Though pianist Orion Weiss does play well and very cleanly, it seems that rather than taking on the role of chamber musician and equal partner in music making, he takes the role of accompanist and leaves the dirty work of making music almost entirely to his partner. All of that said, the beautiful cello playing on this CD makes it a more than worthwile purchase for any music lover."
3,NOT the STEVE PERRY of JOURNEY fame,"I just wanted to make any potential buyers aware that this is NOT the Steve Perry from Journey, but a completely different blues artist. Amazon.com needs to change this very misleading page to add a picture of this ""other"" Steve Perry, and also to remove the special discount you get when you buy another Steve Perry CD, who IS the Steve Perry from Journey. Based on the ""customers who purchased this also purchased...."" I can see that others have been confused or deceived by this page."
1,"THIS NOT STEVE ""THE VOICE "" PERRY","I have also been mistaken by this person who does not place hispix or cd pix on line. Beware unless you know what songs you are lookingfor on The one and only STEVE PERRY if a pix is not shown.don't want anyone else to get burned,.The kids got this cd and they will not even play it matter of fact i think they used it as a frisbee"
3,The picture is too green,"Just wanted to add, I bought mine about 2 years ago, the picture is too green, First I thought it was my monitor, but monitor does fine with the computer, the movie display just fine. If anybody have this issue and solved it please let me know in this review. Thanks.Recently I replaced the monitor the picture from the KWTV1600R is still green."
1,Thanks for improving the American way Andy,It's pretty sad that someone would even publish a book with this title. What's next?Any tenant interseted in this book should divert their energy towards getting their own place.
4,A great cartoon,"Winds of change is a wonderful cartoon! I do love the 5 mini stories in here, starting with the ""Wondermaker"" the main character of the five stories. He starts as Perseus against Medusa, then Actaeon being turned into a deer, then Mercury in the tale of envy, Orpheus decending into Hades and Phaeton wreaking havoc with the sun gods chariot. Definitily a entertaining, if not a bit dark, cartoon(Mind you this was made in 1979 and the music reflects that). Being only 82 minutes long it covers the basic myths very well. I do recommend."
5,Proof that the Book of Mormon is true!,This is a great documentry about Soviern Indian tribs the chief tell the same story that is in the Book Of Mormon..
1,Bad reaction,"I also had a bad reaction to ""hypoallergenic"" NeoStrata PHA 4. Initially, I really loved this cream because it went on smoothly, not greasy, no perfumy smell, etc. The next two days, however, sucked with a *maddening* itch, irritation, redness, puffiness, and even little blisters or something of that nature. The upper lids experienced the worst of it all - even had to sleep with a cool washcloth at my bedside. Guess I need to forsake the sci-fi concoctions and to stick to botanicals."
3,A good basic eye cream,"I bought this eye cream along with Z. Bigatti Re-Storation Eye Return last August (2008) just to prove it to myself if expensive eye cream is better that inexpensive stuff. Sure enough, expensive doesn't mean it is better. On the contrary, NeoStrata eye cream does its job. it's a good basic eye cream; non-greasy, but it does contain lipid to lock in moisture around the eye area."
2,"PUFFY EYES, OR I'M ALLERGIC","I may have jumped the gun on thinking that this was a great product! But after using it several times in the evening before bed, I would wake up the next morning with eyes so puffy, it looked like I had been in a fight! Either I am allergic to this product, or the product isn't good. Determine this for yourself..."
3,Worked well with monitoring,"We bought one in 2006 and it lasted thru about 4 years of use of about 40-60 hours of ""on"" time each year. Now it seems something has burned out in the motor (fan wasn't frozen, no fuse that I could find, heater elements looked fine, etc). So we must buy a new food dehydrator.For a cheap dehydrator, it worked fine. The trays were average; we never had a problem with food on one side vs food on the other. Rotated the trays like the manual said and left the top open 25-50% and it worked great. With some attention the trays lock in place just fine; one just has to be aware of what one is doing, versus spacing out and thinking about other stuff.It gets a 3 out of 5 because it works and comes with 5 trays but has minimal features and only lasted for about 200 hours of use. Final verdict: we will probably look at something else having now owned/used our first dehydrator."
1,"Silly design, burns food","The food will be dried at different speeds, not just because this is a tray tower and the heater is onj the bottom but it also manages to burn food on one side of the circle while the other side remains not dried. Also the towering of trays is odd, trays seem to fit but then you will realize they are not quite mounted."
2,cheap clips,I ordered this from another web site. the quality of the clips keeps going down hill. The clips are so difficult to open to hang in the cage My ferret loves these hammocks. I like their old hammocks but with these clips like they are making them now I had to return it.
1,"Expensive, buggy and not better as Corel 10","Some say Corel 11 has less bugs then the version before. Do not belive that lie! I am using it since 7 days and it has many bugs:- it still hangs on sometimes- there is a copy and paste bug. If u have a file open for a while Corel ""forgets"" how to copy. U can try but it doesnt work in Corel (all other programs still can copy - only in Corel can't).- I am using a 1.8 Ghz machine and it seems to be mutch too slow!Its usefull, but don't spend money for upgrading to corel 11!"
1,A Disaster,"From the uninspiring package (I wonder if this package was designed with Adobe Illustrator just like CorelDRAW 10's was?) to the clunky performance, CorelDRAW 11 just doesn't impress. Sure it's got lots of clipart, but this does not make up for the poor text handling, humungous file sizes, and the ever-so-slow speed (redraw times are particulary snail-like). Plus, it crashes a little too much for my liking.Bottom line is, industry-standard Adobe still does everything better than Corel, so why bother adopting a new learning curve for inferior results?"
5,It's just a little voice.....,"THis album is fantastic. I could go on and on about how amazing it is, but I will spare your eyes. :) This review is mainly for the bonus track that you get with this edition of the CD, Any Way the Wind Blows. It is a STUNNING song. Definitely one of my Sara favorites. I'm mad that it wasn't widely released. But truly, if you can get your hands on this album, do."
5,One of the best music purchases I've made in a long time!,"I heard Sara Bareilles on yahoo music, and was instantly hooked. So often, I like just one or two songs on a CD, so I feel like I've wasted my money. This was not the case with Little Voice. I love every single song on the CD. It's a great blend of upbeat and chill music, and her voice has a wonderful jazz/blues quality to it. I love the melodies, but, as dumb as this may sound, I love the lyrics just as much. They're almost like poetry if you read them on their own. Anyone who is a fan of the singer/songwriters like John Mayer, Josh Kelley and even Amy Winehouse will love this CD."
3,Fiona-Lite.,"It's probably not a fair comparison, but it is a favorable one, Sara Bereilles kind of reminds me of Fiona Apple on her breakout and breakthrough album ""TIDAL."" Lyrically, she's actually saying something. Not as much, but she's saying something. She draws a beautiful, complicated picture and holds your hand as she leads you through it. The Fiona-Lite comparison comes in as she is a much easier, more upbeat, poppier pill to swallow, for now at least. Where Fiona was certainly not holding your hand through her journey but wanted you to feel the pain she felt every step of the way. You feel ""Little Voice"" in your toes and finger tips, and ""Tidal"" was a punch to the stomach. Can't help but think the next time out the gate she'll have more to say and more freedom to say it. But with all that, it's still good material and it's delivered with personality. It makes you want more exploration."
5,It's Perfect!,"I don't really know what else to say about this one. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. This album has everything- charm, edge, wit, sarcasm, soul, encouragement, and of course, love! It's so creative!! I can listen to Little Voice over and over and never get bored with it. Order it now!"
3,Promising,"This album, like many others start out strong but seems to be lacking in something as it goes on. Overall I would say that it's a decent pop album but doesn't have the momentum to take me through the entire record. That being said, I find her work promising and look forward to hearing more of her as her career progresses."
3,"Not bad, just a bit boring","I got this album because I wanted to see what else Sara had besides Love Song (One-hit wonders usually have some good stuff that no one caught on to). There were a few other songs worthy of a 5-star rating, but only one or two. The rest of the album seems to consist of filler songs, still good stuff though, a worthy buy for $2.99"
2,Ho-hum,"Sara Bareilles (along with Colbie Caillat, Ingrid Michaelson and Kate Voegle) have been heavily promoted by VH1 as ""sophisticated, thoughtful"" singer/songwriters. Deservedly, these women have been somewhat pooled together as far as the marketing aspect goes--what I find that they all have in common is accessible (but entirely forgettable) styles of writing, and average, nondescript pleasant voices. I understand the music industry has waves and cycles--consider these girls post-post Lilith Fair fare. Sadly, though, none of these artists have the vocal chops and writing skills of Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos, or Fiona Apple (all of whom have survived the chick/folk/alt. wave of the mid/late 90s--and for good reason). In a year or two, none this new crowd will be remembered. May I recommend some female artists that ARE making music that stands out: Imogen Heap, Goldfrapp, Kosheen, Thea Gilmore, Zoe Johnston, and Carla Werner. Just take a listen and you will see what I mean..."
3,Broken Case,"I love this album, I simply gave it three stars because the case was broken and that's not cool.CD was in good shape though."
1,Enough!,"This woman's songs are simple, trite, and lackluster. I'm sick of being assaulted by her voice and lame piano playing against my will. This is an example of why so-called popular music is best avoided."
1,Where is the free download?,"i bought the album and it was a mistake! I must not have read the LP part of the description. However, it said that a free download was available. After reading everything on the album, there is NO FREE download. It said you needed a code (possibly the small hard to read number under the sticker. It was a big disappointment. After hooking up the old LP, I was not in the MOOD anymore. Sorry."
4,Great addition to the collection,I've been listen to Sarah since her and I were in college at UCLA. Her original songs have always been great and they are well reflected on this album. I really think she's a great artist and musician.
3,Missing some soul,"A lot of good elements, but this album just doesn't quite have enough soul or depth to make it past radio pop."
3,"not so ""snappy""","This girl is definately talented but if you are expecting the rest of the cd to be as ""jazzy"" as her popular track ""Love Song"" you may be a bit disappointed. Most of the cd is pretty chill; its decent as backround while working but its not going to keep you awake for a long drive."
3,A Few Great Songs,"When Sara Bareilles is good she's very, very good. The quality of ""Love song"" alone is worth the price of the album. Her voice is reminiscent of many great soul singers, Dusty Springfield for one. But she definitely has her own unique style. Her voice and style can make an uninspiring song worth listening to. There are several tracks on this album which seem to lack something. However, I was very impressed by not only ""Love Song"" but also ""Bottle it Up"" and ""Love on the Rocks"" I would recommend this album for any Sara Bareilles fan.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
3,Okay,"I bought it for the single ""love song"" and found 2 others to my liking but moth of the rest of the CD was not to my liking. I think I was looking for more of the up tempo pop of the single. Good voice though."
5,Quite good,"When the album first came out, honestly, I avoided it because of the hype and absolutely rampant radio overplaying of Love Song. I never really liked that song at all.About a year later, I bought the album after a friend had, claiming the other songs were still good. They were in fact, correct. Almost every other song on the disc is original, genuinely good music. ""Morningside"" shows off her vocal talent quite well, and ""Fairytale"" is a very unique song. Listen to the words.Overall a great CD."
4,Great Buy,"Having known very little about Sara Bareilles before making this purchase, I have nothing but high praise for this album. Its very well-written and she has a real soulful voice. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a fresh new sound."
4,Beautiful New Voice,"Just this past weekend, I got introduced to the breezy, catchy sound of Sara Bareilles when I first saw her video for ""Love Song"". Whatever 'It' is, she's got 'It'. Her voice is so catchy that she it bursts this song beyond just being the pleasant confectionary that it is.Bareilles has more energy and attitude to her singing than her contemporaries. She has been compared to Norah Jones regularly and may get grouped in with the soft ballad types like Colbie Caillat. But, based on this first song, I'm believe she's so much more. Jones and Caillat produce pleasant music, but its very slow and sleep-inducing. Bareilles, on the other hand, will keep your foot tapping.I'm looking forward to hearing more from this refreshing new artist."
4,Very catchy,"I bought this CD for ""Love Song,"" but I was pleasantly surprised that I like about three or four other songs."
2,First track is awesome... the rest not so much,"How many times has this happened to us all? We love the song we've heard and hope the whole album will inspire similiar feelings... but alas... Sara has a lovely voice, and her lyrics are cute and catchy, but I just can't seem to hold on to this album... I've listened to the whole thing several times now hoping to warm to it... ah me... just buy the one track as an mp3 is my advice."
3,"Charming voice, but repetitive lyrics and music lack replayability","It is quite rare that I say or think this, but I can honestly say that I regret having purchased the entire album rather than the big single on it. Check out Youtube mixes of the other tracks, such as the dull self-important Vegas song, before making your purchase.Also, note that Amazon'unlike eMusic et al) only allows one download of a set of MP3s, so be sure to back it up as soon as you get it and/or buy the actual CD and rip it."
3,"Ciminal Overproduction for a Wonderful, New Talent!","After listening to a sample CD featuring ""Love Song,"" ""Bottle It Up,"" and ""Gravity,"" I was hooked--this woman has an amazing voice and songwriting talent! So I bought the full-length CD and I have to tell you, the overproduction on this album is almost criminal! Instead of the simple ""Love Song"" on the sample that features Bareille's ultra-rich voice accompanied by a piano only, the album opens with an overblown pop anthem that completely dilutes the song, the strength of her voice, and the soul of the song. Each song that followed had a similar over-production that only allowed the heart of the song to peep it's drowning head through before burying it again in bland drums, electric keyboard, and pointless background vocals. This soulful singer seriously needs to find another production company--I'm appalled on her behalf, and saddened that such a fine talent should be treated with so little respect."
5,I'm a fan!,"Sara has an amazing voice and she's not afraid to use it! I've purchased both Little Voice and Kaleidoscope Heart and love them both! If you get the chance, check out her music videos."
5,Little Voice Review - Sara Bareilles,"This is one of the best CDs I've heard in ages and ages. This woman has talent - a great voice, great song-writing ability. I enjoy every single track on this CD - which is unusual. Please hope everyone will try this CD; she deserves great success."
4,Powerful debut,"This young woman has a powerful, dynamic voice. Her sound comes close to the sound you might hear on a pop radio station, but well-thought, meaningful lyrics and top-notch arrangements keep her clear of the trap of being ""just pop"". A very enjoyable effort overall."
5,"where is extended version with lines about ""love letter...""","I was listening MIKE radio in Boston and heard a long version that included lines ""I'm not going to write you a love LETTER...."" in addition to the eponymous ""Love Song."" Where is that extended and augmented version, pretty sure it runs past the 4:20 or so on the album.Anyone familiar with THAT version??"
5,A wonderful find,"What can I say. I like some of the pop I hear on the radio and Love Song was what drew me to Sara Bareilles. I then checked out a few of her videos on the internet and found something much deeper to this artist.I bought the CD and I have to admit I love it more with each listen. There are times I hear a bit of Sarah McLaughlin, some Beth Neilsen Chapman, some Ricki Lee Jones. In all while she may remind me of others she has a unique sound all her own that draws you in with the strength of her voice and song writing.Don't count on much else being a hit on the radio but get this album for what the substance it has to offer beyond a catchy hook."
5,A Gem!,"What a Great double-cd set. I bought this on the strength of the ""I Don't Want to Write You A Love Song"" single and was pleasantly surprised by Sara's voice range and songwriting ability. She's got a great voice and BOTH discs are still in my CD changer!"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this cd. She swears more than I would like. I also didn't like that the version of bottle it up was the album version and not the acoustic/ remix version. I didn't realize there was a different version of it until I got the cd. :(
2,A flash in the pan,"""Love Song"" is catchy, and the most likely reason people have listened to this album. After giving it a try, I have to say that no other songs have any strong melodies or hooks. Nothing is grating or annoying, but nothing sticks out either. The piano playing and instrumentation are quite simple. The other songs generally blend together, and I've listened to it enough to make a fair judgment about that. There are better albums out there."
3,a Trainee of Fiona Apple,"Well...I guess my title says it all...I instantly detected the Fiona Apple heavy piano chordsand general styleThe only thing is, which is a problem for me personally, she is wayy more happy than Fiona...I recommend this album, but if you are a huge Fiona Apple fan like me,it would be hard to avoid the comparison between the two.And, as all trainees are - she needs to keep on training."
2,Blah blah,"Wow, what a great original album. Ok, just a little word to the folks at Rhapsody... having a scrawny, pale white dude nodding his head to one of her two fabulous singles does neither them, nor Sara any good. That being said, Sara gets a start because she's pretty cute and her music is at least tolerable. wouldn't recommend spending hard-earned money on it though."
4,What an awesome voice !!!,Sara is awesome !!! Great voice and great music !!! Very nice !!!An excellent Cd from beginning to end.
4,Big Help for Hot Laptop,"I have a recent model of an HP Pavilion. Due to some poor construction, recent HP's have a very bad tendency to overheat. This pad helps immensely. If you only have a few USB ports, you may want to invest in a USB hub or a non-powered cooling mat, though. This does permanently occupy one or your ports."
4,Nice cooler...Super price,The price for this cooler is very low. I have been using it for 3 months. Keeps my 15.4 Sony cool. Three fans and very quiet. Is doing the job for which I bought it. I'm satisfied.
3,Under Powered?,Despite the description this cooling pad seems a little under powered. The 3 fans don't run very fast and there is hardly any air coming out the back. It does help when using a laptop on your lap. For real cooling power I would look elsewhere.
3,ok but not worth the money,"I bought two different laptop cooling pads. This one and another. This one has three fans, but does not put out any air. The back of the cooler is closed, so no air is drawn from anywhere but directly under the laptop. This air is hot, and it does nothing to help cool my laptop. I have an Dell Inspiron 17 in. It get hot, but with my other cooler it stays nice and cool.In closing, this is a product that I would not buy again. For the money of the cooler and for the laptop you would be much better off buying a Zalman Ultra-Quiet Notebook Cooler, Model ZM-NC1000. This one works great."
1,Absolute junk,Cheap plastic that is so weak that sitting a laptop on top of it compresses the plastic into the fan itself. Fans are noisy. Lasted about 2 weeks.
1,Don't waste your money!,"HORRIBLE! It's cheap, and mine didn't last even three months!PROS: cheap, light.CONS: USB connector is weak, laptop is still warm, small, did not really work for my 15.4 in, flimsy- had to knock it around sometimes because the fans stopped spinning, looks cheap, the paint comes off in places so it looks even more beaten down.Just spend more money and get a better one!"
3,Works but kinda cheap,"There were some good reviews for this fan, so I thought I'd try it out. The good news is it definitely works. I can tell that my laptop is cooler now and the cpu temp has been showing a few degrees cooler than before.But the bad news is that this thing feels like cheap plastic and is fairly loud. Some early reviews said it was pretty sturdy, and some later reviews said it was cheaper, so I think they changed the manufacturing on this item at some point.I can't speak to the durability yet, but it's been running for 2 weeks now, without a problem.I do wish it had a switch to spin the fans in the opposite direction. This one, the fans blow the air down and out the back. I'd prefer to blow the air up, but what do I know."
3,does what it is supposed to do,this chillmat works well. the only complaint is that my laptop kept sliding off the cooling pad and eventually the plastic over the fans broke and it started putting too much strain on my laptop that I had to replace it. It's worth the money. Just remember that it wasn't designed to keep the laptop on top of it.
1,worst to buy,"i advice not to buy this product, quality is very bad no proper cooling system. its waste of money and worst to buy this product."
1,Does not Last!,Don't buy this...there are cheaper better products out there....in 1 month and a half of use and broke... Your labtop will slip off... the bottom lil slip pads fall off very easily... the wire connection is fragile...if you get cought on something...it will rip the wire off... it was a waste of money and time for me!
2,You get what you pay for,"It worked, and kept my laptop cool...for only about 4 months. Then the fans started stopping intermittently. Then they stopped altogether. It looks shoddy and cheap, and it is."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I've had this cooling pad for several months. While it does what it's supposed to by cooling my laptop just fine, it is EXTREMELY noisy. It gets worse the longer you use it. I have a Dell 17"" widescreen and it stays on the pad just fine but seems like it might be too heavy (if I lift my laptop off the pad, the noise is still loud but doesn't seem like as much of a strain on the fans). And if I rest both wrists on the laptop as I type, again the noise gets worse and seems like more of a strain on the fans. Also, I think I'd rather have a pad with a little tilt to it rather than just flat. If you can stand the noise, it's not bad for the price. But I'm ordering a new one soon as I just can't take the noise any longer."
5,Works great - great price,"I was having probs with my Dell overheating and shutting down. Since I started using this, I have not had that problem. It really is quiet! A previous review said it was a tad flimsy, I would agree but I also set it on a laptop pad so I wont break it. It was well worth the price."
1,Horrible,My xps1210 started to heat up in the summer when i'm playing games. It worked fine for the first week but then the power button failed and it's basically half broken.It's cheap and it's worth $5 at the most.Do not buy.
2,Not enough airflow,"This is my 2nd laptop fan. My first one, another brand, eventually stopped working because of an electrical issue. I only paid $15 for my first laptop fan. Seeing another so inexpensive did not make me wonder about quality. But maybe I should have.These fans are not terribly powerful. The design of the unit itself is unbelievably inefficient. The air blows up at the laptop, and it gets trapped as there is no outlet for the air. I can compare it to the other fan I had -- that one had air flow upwards to cool off the bottom of the laptop and then shoot out the sides of the cooling unit. It was much more efficient.Please, carefully look at the design of this unit. Look how the fans blow air upwards... and then where is it supposed to go?I'm buying a different one right now."
1,Didn't work for me.,This product does not work for me. It is quiet enough even with 3 fans but it seems that the fans are turning really slow and they do not cool my laptop.
3,"Not bad, although gave it away","This item is OK. I ordered two cooling fans; one for myself (this one) and the Belkin one for my son (Little bit more money - although worth it)I wanted to see for myself the difference, both came with good reviews.Both are nice and work well, only the Belkin one is a better FANning system. It produces more air and a better air flow.I gave my item away and have since ordered the Belkin for myself as well.It depends how much cooling you need / how often you use your computer...It's nice and does produce air... I just felt it wasn't enough air and the air flow was direct and really pushing hot air out of my unit.Thank you."
2,my computer is still hot on the bottom,"I do not recommend this product. I bought it based on the good reviews, but it doesn't help my computer stay cool. The cooling fans on my computer come on as much as before and when I feel the bottom of my computer, it is still as hot as it used to get. I actually am looking to buy another one that is more effective. Maybe it's effectiveness is contingent upon which laptop you have. I have a Toshiba satellight."
3,Not so silent or well made,"I have to disagree with the reviews about it being silent. I'll admit, it's not loud, but it's not dead silent either. It makes about the same amount of noise as my old desktop hard drive.Also, it was a lot flimsier and lighter than I thought. I just kept thinking how cheaply it's made (like items you buy from dollar stores).I'm using it now, and as far as I can tell, it's working (or it just acts as one giant pad so it doesn't burn your lap instead). So, if you can overlook the not-so-sturdy construction and hard drive like hum, this is for you.Edit: After using this fan even more, it definitely is NOT silent. it has a very subtle dut-dut-dut-dut sound that a fan's wings would make."
4,Great Deal Considering the Price,"I've had this for about 1.5 months now and i can't complain. before using it, my laptop would sometimes turn off from overheating when playing intensive games, but now i never have to look twice at the temp monitor. two of the fans are placed right under heat sinks, so the temp drop is immediately noticeable. I only wish it were larger to better accomodate my 15.4 widescreen laptop, as there is about 1 inch overhang on the sides and .5 inch overhang on the front and back. the fans are quieter than those of my comp, so it isnt annoying to use at all. well worth buying over more expensive competitors."
5,So far so good........,"I've been using this product for two weeks and it's running well, keeping my laptop's bottom nice and cool and the computer running well."
4,Worked as advertised...,"The fans are quiet and the pad was just big enough for my Lenovo T60p laptop. It also did a good job cooling my laptop (especially the HD area, which gets very warm)."
4,Definitely helps cool,Item is conveniently light and easy to use. Definitely has helped cool my laptop down and keep it from working so hard. Also makes laptop MUCH more comfortable to use for long periods of time while placing it on your lap.
3,Works for now!,"This device is keeping my laptop cooler, but not by very much. It is silver metal-looking plastic with three fans, three LEDs and a switch. I would trade the lights and switch for better construction -- I'm not sure how durable it is. I don't see what value the lamps and switch add?? The power drain affects the duration of battery power as well. It does serve as insulation to protect one's lap from the heat of the computer."
1,Don't Buy this product!!!!!,Amazon should really quit selling this piece of cr*p. The fans only work sometimes. I've had my laptop overheat while using it. Buy something else. Don't spend it on this!
3,Effective but Cheap,"First off, this cooling pad seems to work fine and it is one of the more inexpensive options available. Having said that, I don't think I would buy another one. It is very cheaply made and I can't imagine it surviving very long without getting broken. When I squeeze the cooling pad and laptop together to pick them up, I cause the fans to rub on the plastic housing. It works but the quality is not there."
1,Dont waste your money!,"This thing looks good in the picture but when you get it you will be very disappointed! This is nothing but a piece of junk. When I took it out of the box I could see that this was a bad idea it was very light weight plastic with cardboard in the middle. The silver color looks to be spray painted on but I thought I would give it a shot anyway. I set my Dell laptop on it and plugged it in; there was no air coming out of the ""fans"" to cool my laptop. I sent it back and after they took their restocking fee my refund was only $8.00 and I had to pay to ship it back. Customer service when I called was horrible too...don't waste your money or your time!"
2,Unhappily deceived,I purchased the DataStor notebook cooling pad after reading so many good reviews. I was very satisfied for the first month or so until the front fan started making an awful rumbling sound. I decided I couldn't stand the noise and had to block the fan with a piece of tape. So now my front fan doesn't work and now the back left fan is acting up as well. This cooler is cheap and poorly made and considerably smaller than the size of my laptop. Not to mention that my laptop is now overheating much faster.
2,Doesn't wear well,"I may have given this 4 stars before; this is a revised version. After only a month or two it is too noisy. I will probably end up buying a different brand and throwing this away. I may be a rougher user than most, but I don't see what I could have done to create this grindy noise. I frequently fall asleep with my laptop sitting on my bed and this noise makes me nervous and would keep me from napping.At first use, this seemed excellent. But I have changed my mind."
2,it's okay,"The fans doesn't have too much speed, even with three, my laptop still gets hot. Try to look for another one with less fans, or bigger fans or faster fans. The 2 stars are just for the design and low noise."
1,"Awful, just awful.","Barely cools my laptop. Is made of flimsy plastic. At least the USB cord is decently constructed, I guess."
1,Junk,"Upon receiving this cooling fan, I plugged it in and it began to make awful noise as if something inside was loose and rattling around between the fans. Sending back ASAP. The top is not as sturdy as the one it would be replacing, a Targus, about the same size that I've only gotten 5 months out of. My laptop is a lightweight Acer and the top of the cooler flexed enough that when I put the laptop on the fan, it pushed into the fans making even more noise. If you received one that was not damaged or defective, I hope it works for you, but I don't imagine it would hold up long even if it had worked perfectly upon receipt, so I have asked for a refund rather than a replacement. Very disappointed that I'm having to spend money to replace damaged or defective goods. I'm going to Best Buy or Walmart to check for one."
1,Do NOT buy this product,"Save your money. This is the cheapest piece of plastic I've seen. It does not keep my Gateway 17"" laptop cool. I would return it, but the Antonline company charges a 15% restocking fee and it's just not worth the hassle. Don't waste your money - Look for a better quality product. I am extremely disappointed in this product."
1,Didn't last a year,"I had this for only a few months before it stopped working. I contacted the manufacturer, and they sent me a replacement. The replacement only lasted a few months also.I can't recommend this product. Although the manufacturer was responsive the first time I contacted them, it wasn't worth my time to keep contacting them after having the same experience with 2 of these."
4,great little laptop fan,"This is a little cooling pad which is perfectly for my XPS 1330, the size is fit excellent for the cooling purpose.I gave only 4 stars because the materials was made this pad is not so hard, so when I take the laptop with the pad the fans make a weird sound.Anyway, this is a great deal for this price."
5,These work really well...,"I bought 4 of these. Two that go under my laptop and my wifes and two to set in a cabinet that houses my router and 4 external hard drives. I set the drives and router on top of the cool pad. These do an amazing job. I really recommend them, and they are very quiet, actually silent."
5,Works Perfectly!,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. My laptop is so happy staying nice and cool even on those long usage days.
4,Keeps your lap cool,"I bought this because my lap would get uncomfortably warm after using the computer for a while. This cooling pad solved the problem. It works, but don't expect too much. It has three fans in a plastic case that suck air out from under your laptop and exausts it away from you. It's sized for a 15 inch computer, and while it works for a 17 inch the fit is off. It's quite, I don't notice the sound. The computer runs much cooler now."
5,Wonderfully Funny and Profound,"His profound sense of humor and understanding of the bonds between people and their canine or feline companions, is unparalleled."
5,Screw the editing...read the book,"Do these types of relationships really occur at all girl schools? If so, I've truly missed out on something.This story is about the pros and cons of a rich girl rebelling from parents who don't care whether she's where she's suppose to be or not.Enter Shepherd...the down to earth student who show's Lacey a love and life she can be comfortable with.The second meeting long after college between the two was a tear jerker.But the last chapter knocked my socks off.I like Moore's writing!!!!!"
2,Pass this one by,"This short video is poorly produced, with the blaring noise and cheap graphics of the intro taking a significant portion of the half-hour runtime. Admittedly, many kid videos like these have ""cheesy"" or silly actors and actresses, but the narrating actress appears to have been chosen to keep the many men she talks to smiling at her looks and gushing naivety. I had hoped to find a DVD version of ""All About Heavy Construction Equipment"". This isn't it. Only a few trucks are featured, and compared to other videos it just doesn't measure up."
1,Kid's video with porn audio,"My 3 year old likes this but doesn't know any better. We thought it was kind of corny and the acting really phony and really bad (especially the pompous horse's behind that talks about the hydraulic hammer), but when our oldest son came home on leave from the military and overheard the audio from our kitchen, he thought we had lost our minds and let the little one watch a porn video. After watching and listening again, yes, the dialog could be taken from a X-rated video and the music, our older one told us, definately sounded like porn music. Its almost as if a porn company is trying to go legit and not succeeding very well. We'll save this one after the little one outgrows it and joke with him about it 20 years from now. One video that we can stomach and the little one really likes is ""I Love Big Machines, parts 1 & 2"" by TM Books-Video. Try that instead. We gave it the 1 star for kid appeal but No stars from our view."
3,Meh,"Flavor was OK. Not sure I'd put them in the gourmet gumball category, but what gumball really is gourmet? I'd take good ole Double Bubble over these any day."
2,"Again, few broken, gorgeous color... horrid taste","I have no problems with the seller or the shipping, but I really didn't expect these things to taste this awful. They aren't inedible, but what I get out of most gumball machines tastes far better- these have a definite rubber taste, a weird sweetness (not real sweet, just... chemically sweet I guess? it's weird) I am hoping this odd flavor isn't from sitting in a warehouse for years on end.If it seems like a cut an paste review, that's because it is. all 3 products (three flavors of gumballs) were identical."
4,These are for rifles,"This is a nice brush, but is too long to use in most pistols. It would get 5 stars if the description made it clearer that they were unsuitable for use with smaller pistols"
2,Just consultant's sales presentation in book form,This book doesn't do much to explain revenue management beyond oversimplified results and glossed over examples. It discussed neither strategy nor tactics in any way that was fulfilling
2,"Good concepts, but it sells the author's firm too heavily","For those with not much formal training in Economics it does a nice job of introducing price discrimination concepts with many examples. However, a couple other key factors in RM are just mentioned, and not even superficially explained: Clustering techniques to determine who your customers really are and the very tricky science (and art) of developing good Forecasting models."
3,good book - but nothing new,"It is really a nice book, and good for people that have never heard about Revenue Managment, but it is also mainly a sales-man's book and not critical enough towards Revenue Managment."
1,This record means the end of the world has come,"this record is the end of the world. when the songs of the greatest artist of the 20th century are defiled in the worst way. these bands dont dont anything about anything. these covers are among the worst ever in the history of the world, and it is a shame they are covers of the best songs in the history of the world. these bands are wretched. they have disrespected dylan to the highest degree. among the worst tracks on this record: dont think twice, extraordinarily whiny yelling annoying, my back pages: way to cover a cover you idiots, couldnt even be creative with the song and do it your own way, you re-created the byrds' cover, but just defiled that as well, if not for you: this band is probably the highest offense on this album, the distorted annoying guitars, do an immeasureable dishomage to a great work of art. lastly, the man in me. you people are horrible. great disappointment."
3,Not great to mediocre overall (with the exception of a single shining song),"I can't say I was super impressed with the vast majority of these songs. But I am, however, a die hard Say Anything fan. Their cover of The Man in Me was a-a-awesome as is all of their music. One of the best things about SA is they aren't afraid to have a sense of humor and have fun with the music which they absolutely did on this album. Lighten up people, these are Bob Dylan covers. This would imply that the songs included in this compilation are going to not, in fact, be performed by Dylan and therefore are going to have very different qualities than that of his music. That's the whole point of a cover, to do something over but with a different spin. If you don't like the songs, that's one thing but it's not fair to bash them into the ground because they're different from what you heard/loved before."
1,These song arrangements are truly awful.,"On most of the songs in this compilation, the musicians' goal appears to have been to race through the song as quickly as possible without any attempt to understand or reflect the meaning of the song. These are Dylan songs, for chrissake. The lyrics are important.In any event, I regret buying this, and I'm sure I'll never listen to any of it ever again."
1,Emo + Dylan = Shotgun Blast to the Head,"Wasn't there just a crappy comp of crappy emo bands covering Bob Dylan? How many of these do we really need? Except for a somewhat clever hip hop version of All Along The Watchtower, this is complete garbage."
5,Excellent counting book for little ones,"As Carlo goes through his day he is presented with lots of opportunities to count. While the story is simple, each page provides a wealth of opportunities to count the number being discussed. At the deli Carlo can count 6 hot dogs but as your child examines the page he or she will find that almost everything in the picture comes in the same quantity. The book offers more of an opportunity for discovery than most counting books."
4,Book reviewer turns reporter to meet baseball stars,"Christopher Lehmann-Haupt leaves the safe haven of his ""New York Times"" book review desk to become a reporter and see close up the game he has loved since childhood. Right up front the author allows how he's not a journalist. Indeed, he finds it a nearly impossible chore to even approach many of the legendary stars he needs to talk with for the book he wants to write. Surely, he is far from the aggressive, pushy reporter forcing himself onto the players. In fact, he's much in awe of some of these stars of the diamond, which is exactly why this book works. A charming journey for readers and fans alike."
3,I enjoyed this book because of Hortense's witty personality.,"No More Cornflakes is about a girl Hortense, who has alot of problems in her life. First, her parents are acting like rabbits. Then, her mother is suddenly throwing up & she finds out it's because she's going o have a baby! Then her best one & only friend is leaving her for another girl named Doris. She has so many problems, how will she overcome them all?"
4,Cleans just fine.,"This works as well as most brushes that I've used. The bristles begin to fall off after 6 cleanings, but are still usable for many more cleanings. Most cheap brushes don't last nearly as long."
4,Ambitious with a decent scope,"There's a fair amount of good content, with a couple of chapters on 3d by Glen Rhodes, who is a good author and inspiring scripter."
3,Some great stuff in here,"I've been playing rollerhockey competitively for two years now and am drooling for some good instruction videos. The Howe: Defense one was the second I've seen. Although kind of cheesey and produced in 1987, the content is solid and useful. A few more examples would have been nice, but that's what rewind is for... There are some great tips and standard strategies in here that I just did not know (and I'm captain of two adult rollerhockey teams!). Almost all of it can be applied to rollerhockey."
1,Apocalypse In Oklahoma,"This book was poorly researched, and is lacking in factual content. The Ruby Ridge incident was described with many errors, and the fact that this book was written 5 years after the incident occurred, when many of the actual facts were known, and proven in court, the author should have had the facts on this issue straight. If you are thoroughly knowledgeable about what happened at Ruby Ridge, you can begin to realize that this book is biased, and full of untruths. From the point of the Ruby Ridge description on, I did not take the book as factual or objectively written."
3,Solid overview of Oklahoma City bombing,"Despite the overwrought title, ""Apocalypse in Oklahoma"" is a sober look at the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and at Timothy McVeigh. The book is superior to ""American Terrorist"" (Lou Michel & Dan Herbeck) in that it portrays McVeigh even-handedly where ""Terrorist"" gets too close to McVeigh & is at times overly sympathetic towards him. ""Apocalypse"" is refreshing in resisting the temptation to get drawn into silly conspiracy theories. The book's greatest weakness is an unnecessarily negative, broad-brushed, ill-informed portrayal of the U.S. Army & soldiers. It is clear that Hamm lacks knowledge about the Army. As a soldier, I found his portrayal inaccurate, verging on offensive. If the characterization of the Army had been more accurate, I would have given the book more stars. Otherwise, the book is a solid broad description of the bombing & the events & personalities surrounding it."
5,"Great Movie, Greater Man......","I've known him personally for about 5yrs. His sister is my mom's friend. His sister usually gives us tickets to boxing events in the Chicago area, his brother usually fights on the fights we attend. Chavez is so humble in person, he usually sits with my family and talks to us about his brother, he never praises himself or tells us about his accomplishments. His sister gave us the DVD with his autograph at a party because she said he liked us and hoped we'd enjoy it. I love it. It really shows how tough and gritty life can get for a Mexican American living in the streets, but it also shows that with a great family behind you things can get turned around."
2,"Great idea, poorly made.",I really liked the slide lock style of this knife and the small size made it a perfect everyday knife. Within a few days of having the knife all the screws started to work loose and some eventually fell out. I understand screws may occasionally need tightened but it shouldn't be every 2 days. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Ugh,"The most outstanding thing about this book is the translation. Absolutely horrific. The author seems to have tried to modernize the language so it would be accessible to a wider reading audience. Probably an audience of ghetto high school students since charaters are saying things like ""What's up?"", ""It's pretty obvious"", and ""I guess so."" This translation is not worth buying for personal reading, nor is it appropriate to college courses.That said, the 27 page introduction is quite good and worth reading. It should have been published as a separate essay."
2,"Beautiful colors, not my taste","The gumballs look great in our new gumball machine, but unfortunately neither my husband and I nor the children enjoy the taste very much."
3,Things you might change in your buble gum,The bubble gum s good but loses its flavor quickly. Also it made my mom chp her tooth. But overall it was good
4,Wonderful glider!,This is a great glider for the money and it was very easy to assemble. It took me about 15 minutes to put together while I was 9 months pregnant. It matches the white Bassett furniture from Target perfectly. It glides very smoothly and doesn't make any noises like some I tried out. The fabric does look a little worn on the arm rests and my daughter is just 8 months old. The pads are removable though so when she's older I'll just remove them.
5,Great buy!,Great buy if you like Nancy Drew games 5 for the price of 1. The games are all fun to play (more than once!). Secrets Can Kill is my only complaint because you have to keep switching the 2 cd's as you go through the game.
2,Guilty of what she accuses,"The author, although well educated in the beliefs of pagan/goddess worshiping religions, tends to be guilty of the very things she accuses patriarchal religions of. She states that male-dominated religions (especially Christianity) are responsible for the atrocities committed against women over the past 2-3 thousand years (a true enough fact) but then proceeds to encourage a view so far to the opposite extreme by encouraging a purely feminist/matriarchal worldview that she completely discounts any male contributions are possible unless he is thouroughly rooted in the feminine. Overall, she understands the history of what paganism/ goddess worship is rooted in but completely misses the belief that equal contributions come from both women and men which, when in balance, benefit all of society."
2,tedious,"I found this book used, and am glad I didn't pay full price for it.First, most of it is Christian bashing, pointing out errors and fallacies in the Bible. If the Goddess movement is to become a religion in its own right, then we must stop basing OUR religion on someone else's. It doesn't matter what Christians believe. If they are comfortable with their religion then it doesn't matter if I may percieve some of the ideas as outdated or childish.Secondly, she seemed to spend a lot of time recounting arugments she had with ""lesser intellects"" on the subject of religion, all of which she ultimately won. She's never wrong, nor does she ever admit that she had to change her mind on a subject. The older boy at the dance, the veteran at the college party... all these stories are presented to show how superior her intellect is to any man's.It is boring to read, and there's not much to the book besides this."
4,Great shopping mag for Canadian fashionistas!,"This is, in a way, a Canadian equivalent to Lucky. It was launched in the summer of last year and after I bought the first issue, I was hooked. It has everything you need to know about new beauty products, new trends and great new stores opening around Canada. It also has this ""Remix"" section about lifestyles, books, music, etc. In the back, there are also a bunch of great deals that you can use in Canadian stores. The only flaw was that the magazine layout was a bit crowded. It's a great read when you're on the road or on the way to the mall!"
4,nTren 1690-552 MP3 Data Storage Watch,I loaded the watch with 62 MP3's this seems to be the max it will hold. The sound is very very good. I'm happy with the watch.
1,"ok for kids,but ...","if for kids, then it would be ok, but for girl friend, then u'd better looking for sth else"
4,Nice book,"Its a very nice book as those who pirates, those kids will be really really into this book .. my 3 yr old enjoy it fully"
5,Our favorite alphabet book yet!,"Our two sons (5 and 2) absolutely love pirates, so we were immediately drawn to this book when we saw it. The whimsical pictures and interesting writing sold us on the book. It isn't written in your typical sing-songy alphabet book rhyme, although the rhyme and rhythm are still there. As parents, my husband and I love the way the kids have to ""search"" in the pictures to find the letters - for instance, the ""S"" is in the curve of the blade of a pirate sword and the ""O"" is a life preserver. Our 2 year old giggles every time we reach the ending (but I won't give that away!) You just can't go wrong with this book."
3,"learning made fun, for a four year old","This is a wonderful story of a pirate that is in search of all the letters in the alpabet. My grandson delighted in identifying the letters the pirate crew found and searched the page for more letters for them to ""catch""....easy source for sharing and learning"
2,Fun but it could be better.,"I didn't care for this book as much as I liked ""Pirate Alphabet."" The rhymes are cute in this book, but it didn't seem to really focus on the alphabet as much as the aforementioned book did. This book is about a crew of animal pirates who lose their letters at sea and must find them. The author did not use that many ""piratey"" words to accompany the letters of the alphabet. I read this book to my son twice to give it a chance, but it failed in comparison. I ultimately gave it away."
1,Boring Story & Rude illustrator,"Rather boring, but i could be biased we went to a children's function. The illustrator was there to read the story and talk to the kids alittle bit. He was extremely boring then to top it off, he yelled at the kids who were talking & pointed his finger at people in the crowd, they were really little kids. We got up & walked out even though our kids weren't talking, it was horrible. I had already bought this book but i wished i wouldn't have. A kids book drawn by someone who doesn't like kids."
1,"Works too hard, not much to show for it","This book irritates me to pieces. My 4 year-old son likes it OK, but I find the poor rhyme and meter and inconsistent letter-related words (how many words start with letter in question, quality--choice of words) too distracting. A big disappointment because the concept and title are great..... I keep telling my son we'll rewrite it one of these days!"
4,very rockin' Foghat album,"This is a noticeably harder rock album than Foghat had ever made previously. The sound has a harder edge to it, and has a pretty fast pace. It still has a blues base, but they seem to be drifting a bit from their blues base here. Mind you, it's still a good Foghat album, just different from ""Night Shift"" - a little less bluesy, and little more rocking. Still full of slide guitar, as we have come to expect from Foghat - slide guitar is really their signature sound.My favorite cuts on this album are ""Stone Blue"", ""Sweet Home Chicago"", and the ballady ""It Hurts Me Too"". This last one is an interesting one; it starts out as a ballady type song, and, later on, starts to ""light up"" as Rod Price cranks on the slide guitar.""Sweet Home Chicago"" is an old blues song, but Foghat really lights a fire under it. It's one of my favorite Foghat tunes!"
5,The advertisement should make clear geographic coverage.,"Down in the South Hemisphere, we have a completely different fauna. Let alone Australia, which besides South has a fauna of its own. This book should specify, it is written only for Europe and North America? Are the South american and Australian animals included?"
3,Okay,"The provocative title got my attention and the author tries hard to be controversial but this book reads like a Jackie Collins or Judith Krantz imitation. Take away the race angle and all you have left is a spicy, shallow little trifle. I enjoyed it but I'll forget it in two weeks. This is a beach book."
2,Down This Set,"I am a big Downset fan. I've followed everything they've ever done, even going so far as to pick up expensive import singles from previous albums. But 'Universal' is a real piece of crap. The lyrics are super weak, the songs are repetitive(some even bordering on being completely annoying). What happened to these guys? Hugely disappointing, especially after a four year wait since their last album."
4,Very nice!,"I mounted this light over my kitchen sink and really love it. It is beautiful and looks great in my kitchen. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 only because I wish it could handle a brighter bulb than 100 watts, but I like a LOT of light in the kitchen. I have 4 of the matching single light mini-pendants hanging in various areas of the same room and really love this design!"
3,World Car,"This article describes Ford's attempts to make a global car to obtain advantages of scale, where costs of unit of production would be minimal. First attempt to build a world car was in 1960, when American version was never produced. Second attempt (1981), Ford Escort, cannot be called a world car because European and American versions differ completely and only have the name in common. The third attempt, started in 1986 is described bit by bit. In the case description of Ford Mondeo, the attention is paid to the motives, internal organization, role of outside suppliers and information technology.I would recommend Cases on Global It Applications and Management: Success and Pitfalls by Felix Tan in addition to this article."
2,not a good choice,"the first few chapters were good , with alot of solid information, but after that it went downhill very fast, The book makes it sound like you wil learn about programming tricks that only the bog boys know about , but any book written about 3d game programming in c/c++ will have the same information ,probably even more. I wouldnt suggest this book to anyone . and some of the source code is wrong , but if you already know c/c++ you can get around that"
3,Looks nice,"This Hard Drive Cooler Bracket fits well but doesn't really cool the HD that much,maybe a few celsius degrees down.It does not come with a build in led colors."
5,Very eclectic in style,"This is a very unique sound. Great for new believers and young ones(because of the wording it fits young in the Lord crowd). I bought this for my husband but my teenage daughter loves it and wont let it go. If you love a country sound this is great, if you love the blues this is graet ,if you love pop this is great, not just one style but many and its wonderful!"
4,"Can't agree with ""negative"" review","Better Questions does just that, question if there are better ways to live and show your love for Christ. I attended church with Todd as our Music Director so I could've personally taken offensive at some songs but instead knew it wasn't about our specific church but all churches that need to ask questions of themselves; if you don't know what those questions are then listen again with a more open mind & ear. That's why our church is called ""the perfect place for imperfect people"", are all churches that way? Are you that accepting of others or just showing up? These songs test you and make you look hard within yourself, the way God knows you."
5,better questions is incredible,Todd Agnew continues to inspire with his honesty and amazing lyrics. He talks about things other artists just gloss over. This album is amazing. It is what the church needs to hear and realize. I am so tired of happy peppy everything is going to always be alright music. Life is hard. People have real pain. It is okay to ask questions. This album is refreshing and one of best out there. I highly recommend it.
4,Moisture built up,"Good while lasted. After two years, moisture start to build up inside. I opened and removed moisture, it came back after two weeks. Seals might only been designed to last two years....?"
5,a *must have* book if you care about your cats,"still use my original 1975 edition that was bought that year, but have seen this re-issue and am glad it is back in print... it is a *must have*. over 21 years, 'the well cat book' has been the saving grace for more cats than i can remember; housepets who needed general care on up to rescuing farm cats that were involved in serious accidents (if you're not the squeamish sort)... most people don't end up in such situations, but the needed information is there.for the average housecat owner, you will be pleasantly suprised about how much time and $$$ will be saved at the vet on tests/ diagnostics because of the clear, common-sense and descriptive information dr. mcginnis provides.the really *big* bonus is a *healthy and long life* for your purry companion thanks to all the information about diet and general daily home care!"
3,Works as expected but support is iffy.,"I had to upgrade from previous version to work with the newer cameras released by Axis. Axis routinely retires old cameras and new camera will require updates. You get 1 year update for free but after that, you are out of luck. A little difficult to setup. Less flexibility than 2.0 version but works as described. I would have given more star if functionality was not taken away and one more if they didn't make it incompatible with newer cameras. aka. 207 and 2011 are same cameras but newer cameras are not compatible."
1,[Weak],"Myself being of Mexican descent, I found this album to be [weak]. Political messages in rap went out about 13 years ago. Lyrics are pretty weak, though the production is ok. But having listened to rap for 20 years now, lyrics are what matter to me. If you take this rap out of its L.A. context, there isnt much value left in this. No one outside of the Southwest would buy this..."
2,"already in ""Citizenship Papers""","These nice and thoughtful essays were already in Berry's ""Citizenship Papers: Essays"" I wish I had known that before I bought both."
1,"Not sure, cant get it through amazon","I have been trying to order this since December and still have not had it shipped by March. I have found a newer model on here the av1210 in the Tools section. This one actually seems to be stocked, so I have ordered that one."
3,Bore cleaning brushes,"I don,t know why they put one item in which they could put 30 more. What can you say about bore cleaningn brushes except I am glad they have one for 7.62x39 Cool Ha!!!!!!!!!"
4,Extraordinary review of pocket watch history,"It's astonishing. We think that pocket watch history is a relatively limited event. Actually there were millions of watches made, and they have all left a trail. This book helps you understand the great manufacturing impulse at work in the 19th century. It gives you an equally extraordinary perspective into watches being made at that time. You will learn a lot from this book. Then, if you want to dig deeper into the brands and histories that the book presented, you can. Why not five stars? Well, this book didn't tell me everything. There must be other books that tell you more. Regardless, this is a critical work."
2,"Storytellers, not really","This book is OK, but not a good source of ideas for storytellers. This has a formulated style to it -- little room for creative expression.Probably good for those who aren't truly looking for storytelling that involves one's own interpretations of things."
4,Tried and True,"This is my second unit and, like many other buyers, I have found this product to be reliable, exactly as described by manufacturer and retailer, and updated whenever issues arise needing any software changes. Like any high quality product, it demands the buyer understand fully how it's used and for this, the booklet provided is very good. I would add, only, that if you are unfamiliar with the inter-action of your PC's audio system and ""add-in"" cards that you explore this area fully, as with Windows, the only OS I am familiar with, specific adjustments are a bit tricky, somewhat hard to locate and subject to mysterious ""automatic"" changes. This, however, does not reflect on the product, that from my experience appears to be valiantly engineered to overcome these shortcomings. The more intricate your application of this product will require commensurate diligence to find, master and eliminate these basic issues."
4,Delta 1010LT vs 3 sound cards.,"Bought my first Delta 1010LT; 10 years ago, it's still working great. Was using a second computer, as final mix. Tried to get around mixing 5.1 audio; using a Audigy card, m/b audio inputs, and a USB device; so I would have 6 seperate audio inputs; without buying another 1010LT. Worked fine, until you have to playback, and export waveforms. 2 M/B waveforms, would change slightly in timing, on long songs. Won't have a problem with this; using another 1010LT. Why 4 stars? Never liked the 2 XLR mic/analog inputs, I prefer, all RCA inputs. The 10 input, outputs are misleading. There are only 8 analog inputs, and outputs. The correct number for this model should be; 88-2SPDIF. One day, will buy another; to have 16 ins, and 16 outs; on the main computer."
5,A great interface!,"Ideal for home studios built on a desktop PC. Crystal sound, 10 ins 10 outs (1 in and 1 out are 100% digital), MIDI in and out all on an easy-to-use (and install) PCI card. Perfect compatibility with Windows O.S. also, even 64 bits versions."
3,"Good value, bad Vista driver, customer service is awful","This is an affordable card for a basic home studio. Unfortunately I've found that on Vista, the driver crashes your system upon going into sleep or hibernate mode. I reported this problem to M-Audio. They reported that Vista SP1 drivers were not ready yet and would be released soon. I waited and downloaded the current driver which still crashes, and provided a minidump of the crash. The representative was courteous and promised to follow up with a developer, however he never got back to me and the problem report was closed without an explanation.So in summary, this isn't a bad card if you disable sleep mode or can remember to disable the card after every time you use it."
3,DO NOT USE WITH WIN 7.,"I have owned 4 of these cards for over 5 years and they have been working faithfully with little problem under windows XP 32 bit. Since I moved to windows 7 x64 there have been nothing but audio quality problems. The company is slow to release windows 7 drivers that work properly and frankly, since they were acquired by AVID a couple years ago even the XP drivers have been dodgy, to say it politely. If you want to build a nice DAW with XP and these cards, go for it. But stay away if you want to run windows 7. Do yourself a favor and look at the M-Audio forums. They are filled with people saying exactly that."
3,Approach with caution,Be aware that M-Audio has limited to no support for Windows XP 64 bit users. This was a very unwelcome surprise to encounter.
2,Watch out!,"The picture here does not match the name of the product being sold!! The picture is of the Delta 1010 LT. I am very curious to know which one is actually being sold, however."
3,Not as good as RIM,"While I did not dislike the book. Beshers second novel seems to have lost some of the edge apparent in the first.All the elements are there, a cyberpunk/buddist setting, a deadly virus that could destroy the world and a few attempting to fight against it. However after a good start the plot seems to meander and the frequent jumps from character to character and in and out of various sub plots that Besher makes can lead to confusion on the part of the reader. I am going to go back to it a second time and feel that it may then grow on me but at the moment I can only say that it is readable but nothing special."
2,a sloppy juxtaposition of good ideas,"The author is excellently descriptive, I enjoyed many of the author's imaginative ideas (sentient tattoos, Hail A Lama taxis, etc.), and enjoyed his obvious love for the Bay Area (obvious echos of Philip K Dick's love for the same). However his ideas were possibly too fruitful often colliding with each other rather then meshing, leaving the story line in tatters.The concept of the ""Hail A Lama"" taxi cabs were a stroke a brilliance that could be the basis for an entire novel. However in MIR it is only given a quickly discarded backstory and then used as impersonal plot continuation device. The character's backstories were often just as rashly introduced in brief flashbacks only to be basically ignored. Thus leaving the characters feeling as if they were only hollow pivot points for a runaway plot. By the end of the book I was reading fairly quickly and mainly only to get it over with -- not that the ending was really worth it anyway."
3,"Some Hits, Some Misses","Too much filler hampers this collection of late-70s disco. Good sound and liner notes, all original versions."
3,No Subtitles,"This telenovela is one of the best ever made however, they failed to include any subtitles whatsoever! No Spanish or English subtitles. Guess Telemundo-Universal doesn't care about those who are hearing impaired. I am just dumbfounded that they failed to include that which was original to the show...subtitles. The show became a hit in its 10pm time slot, this was thanks to a significant number of viewers who were able to follow along with the English subtitles...guess universal doesn't want to appeal to that fan base. Just when I thought I could erase my recordings of the show...well I'm glad that I didn't because those recordings have the subtitles. These DVDs were a waste of money. minus 2 stars for no subtitles, come on universal I'm hard of hearing give me subtitles in any language!"
5,"Best Soap Opera (Warning, you'll get addicted to it)","This soap opera/series is a nail biter with an excellent plot and plenty of adventure. Although I agree with most people about the subtitles; they are NEEDED!I speak Spanish but even then, I missed out on some colloquial terms that I was not aware of. Plus, they are missing out on the English speaking market. This is like 24 but ""En Espanol"".Loved it!"
2,I wish I saw the comments that said there were no English subtitles,"The series is great, so if you speak Spanish don't pass this up. The problem is that they made the stupid decision to not include subtitles. I ended up buying these for my wife (she speaks Spanish and I don't) and we couldn't watch them together. I had to wait for it to show up on TV and we watched it that way."
5,I Love it !,"I already saw the Series on TV but I want to keep it forever, I very recommended to see it for the people that not watch it already."
4,Cute Book!,This is cute book about animals dressing up and leaving the zoo for a night on the town. The illustrations are beautiful and my daughter (age 2) seems to really enjoy listening to it being read.
3,one of their weakest,"Screeching Weasel has put out a number of great albums over the years, thanks to Ben Weasel's immense songwriting talent. If you're new to Screeching Weasel, check out MY BRAIN HURTS or ANTHEM FOR A NEW TOMORROW; each album as a slew of great songs. WIGGLE was made between those 2 albums, but strangely is quite uneven and has just a few great songs. According to the liner notes on the CD, the band was feeling the pressure from the relative success they had with MY BRAIN HURTS. Oh well. WIGGLE is still a good album, and worth buying, but it's far from their best. The remastered version of the album has a few extra songs which are excellent."
2,Why?,"At first I thought this book was a kind of less involved but broader reaching version of the Beck & Friedwald book on Warners. Cartoons are listed alphabetically with date and (very) brief credits along with a one or two line review. Although not as in depth as the B&F book it does cover cartoons from all the studios. Fine, but although it covers all the studios it doesn't cover all the cartoons! The introduction tells us that it covers all types of animation (drawn, puppet, computer etc) but only that available on videotape or on TV & Cinema release now or recently. So why doesn't it mention Carrotblanca or Box Office Bunny? Both recent Bugs Bunny cartoons. It has the feeling of an amateur book, a listing of someone's personal collection that doesn't include stuff he doesn't have. I'm sure a book that lists every cartoon ever made by anyone is a practical impossibility but this kind of book (especially at this kind of price) needs to be far more comprehensive than this."
2,Not enough.,"The beginning is very basic, which is good. But after the beginning, I was left saying ""and..."". There was no more. It went on to other aspects of photography that doesn't really help you with picture taking. It was about troubleshoot and other useless information that if you needed to know, you would just look on your owners manual.This book is not NEARLY enough to ""start photography"". I suggest something like Understanding Exposure to get a more detailed look on photography."
4,A snap at half the price!,For a first in photography you really couldn't ask for more. Michael Langford guides you round the jargon with ease and will soon have you talking like a professional! With the added bonus that you'll actually understand it! He covers everything you'd need to know in an easy to read stlye. Including projects to do easy enough for total beginner or the more serious amatur. You don't need a high tech camera to follow either there is something for everyone. The book only lost one point with me because i felt the chapters weren't well enough defined. Reccommended to all!
3,No quality sound,This cymbal has no solid sound as a crash or a ride cymbal. It has a terrible deep ring after you hit it. Its not the best.
3,Enchanted (The Donovan Legacy),"Nora Roberts is wonderful at writting romance novels. I've only read 3 of the Donovan Legacy's and all 3 have been very good. There's a little magic and alot of romance. You can almost feel what they're feeling. I laughed and got tears in my eye's through out the whole book. If you like Nora Roberts, then you'll love these books."
5,Enchanted,What a good book. I loved the first three books and was so thrilled to see the fourth. I enjoyed seeing them get together and the romance and humor in the book. It was the kind of book you don't want to put down and you don't want it to end. I love all the characters as I did with the whole series and really wish there were more books in it.
5,I loved this book!,"I really enjoyed this book, as well as the other Donovan family stories. I just hope that she will write more about them!"
3,A Charming Romance,"I was entranced with the story of Rowan and Liam. It was a wonderful story filled with wonder. Unfortunately, Ms. Roberts was sadly lacking in some parts of the story. I had read the previous stories with the Donovan Legacy and I found somethings not true. I understand Morgana and Sebastian had twins, well, Ana had triplets. In the story, Enchanted, Sebastian only had a son and his wife was pregnant. Also, in Ana's Story, I believe was Charmed, there is no mention of Liam attending the birth of Morgana's twins' Birth. Over all, you will be thrilled with this wonderful, charming story filled with magic."
5,I Loved It,"Nora Roberts books are all excelent ,however i love to read the ones about familys and there hopes and dreams."
1,Major Disappointment,"I loved the original trilogy. The leads were strong, compelling, smart and honorable.Rowan and Liam are not. Rowan is spineless, Liam is a jerk. Why Rowan didn't feel violated when she learned Liam had been spying on her in his wolf form or creeping into her dreams to have sex with her is beyond me.I was expecting much much more.I hope next time Roberts allows her characters integrity. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel with Jessie from _Charmed_. Only if it was done well, otherwise leave well enough alone."
2,"Shape-shifting, hokey-pokey is not my thing.","I discovered Nora Roberts about four months ago and I've read more than ten of her books including all the McGregor series as well as the ""Born in..."" series. I truly enjoyed all of them and have reread some of them already. However, I must say I am very disappointed in ""Enchanted"" and I can't seem to get beyond page 100. I find Liam's shape-shifting and teleporting a little creepy. All I can say is that I am glad I read all her other novels before I picked this one up or I would never have found out what a marvelous story teller she is. Well even the great ones do lay an egg once in a while."
1,What A Bunch of Hooey!,"I'm a huge fan of paranormal books, regardless of genre, and I also enjoy Nora Roberts. So I borrowed this book from a friend because the premise sounded great. Needless to say, what a bore. The characters were underdeveloped, the magic lacking and the typical Nora Roberts passion gone. I was so disappointed in Liams and Rowans lack of feeling or expression of it. The flipant attitudes of the characters suprised me and by the end of the book I thought was a waste of time. My suggestion is to stear clear of this one and pick up The Passion by Donna Boyd!"
2,Disappointing,"This book just never grabbed my attention, I'm afraid. I can usually finish a category romance in an evening, and this took me several days because I kept putting it aside. I found the hero not very heroic, the heroine was showing a lot more angst than her situation called for (so was the hero, IMHO) and the hero's parents were more deus ex machina than real characters. The love story had no heat, either. Moreover, it didn't have the same fun and fire of the other Donovan books. Read them, and give this one a miss."
3,it's just for entertainment,"This is a cute story. That's all. Yes, there are other Nora Robert's book that will ""enchant"" you, but if you've read the first three, you've got to at least give this a chance. Read it for the fantasy of it! I didn't find Liam ""creepy"". If you read the book in the spirit it's intended, a romantic fantasy, it's a nice read... relaxing and an enjoyable addition to the Donovan Legacy."
2,disappointment,"not up to Nora's standards-just piggyback on the Donovan Legacy to sell this sequel-not much plot. I love her, but not this time"
2,Unbelievable,I really enjoyed the series of books that came before Enchanted and was looking forward to seeing more about those characters and some family member of theirs but found the main characters of this book lacking.
4,The Donovan Legacy continues,"Enchanted is the next book in the Donovan Legacy series. If the reader has read the previous books, this one is a charming addition. It stands on it's own as well if you haven't read the others.The relationship between Liam Donovan and Rowan Murray begins in Oregon where Rowan has gone on vacation to a friends cabin. Rowan becomes alarmed when she sees a golden-eyed black wolf watching her but then she begins to become more comfortable with the presence of the wolf. She meets her elusive neighbor, Liam, and is mystified by him. She begins having erotic dreams of Liam she can't explain.Liam is a Donovan witch and can `shape-shift' into different forms. He is the wolf that watches Rowan and who she has taken into her home.I found Enchanted to be an excellent addition to the Donovan Legacy and enjoyed it from beginning to end. It lives up to the other books in the series and was an enjoyable read."
3,Not A Werewolf?!,"As a reader of paranormal fiction, it always amuses me when authors claim that vampires aren't vampires which has become an increasingly popular approach. In this novel Nora Roberts' hero who usually shapeshifts into wolf form refuses to be categorized as a werewolf. He doesn't think he's a werewolf because werewolves are supposed to be brutal uncontrolled killers. Not only isn't this the universal portrayal of werewolves, but this stereotype is a slander against real wolves. So I don't appreciate a perpetuation of the slander in paranormal romances.Yet I did like the heroine's comfort with wolves, or at least with this particular wolf. That was the most remarkable aspect of the book.Over time Nora Roberts has gotten better at characterization and backgrounds. I wish that Nora could write a Donovan novel with the writing skills that she has now. She would do quite a job on it. Enchanted is a bit unsophisticated."
3,Enchanted,"I found this book to be mildly entertaining but not as good as the last two books in ""The Donovan Legacy"". The hero, Liam, is a witch who has the ability to shapeshift, and spends much time in the early chapters in the shape of wolf. In this form he keeps company with Rowan, a confused woman who's in the woods ""searching for herself"". When Liam revealed himself to her I was hoping she'd be a lot more angry with him! He had watched her undress, bathe, sleep, and he slipped into her mind to dream with her. Perhaps this book would have gotten 1 more star had Rowan been less mild a heroine. She herself refers several times to how she has no pride -- that's for sure! But all in all the book is a worthwhile read if you have already read and enjoyed the other Donovan books."
5,You'll find a piece of Stan's soul in each song he sings.,"I've long been a Stan fan, I was actually at his last concert in Halifax, hence the CD ""Home in Halifax"". It was wonderful and I'm glad I was there, as it was his last. If you haven't already purchased it, may I suggest Northwest Passage. This album and Forerty's Cove are the Stan I loved. Everyone can claim some piece of the lyrics as their own."
5,No Lightfoot Here......,"One of the best Stan Rogers compilations. Great maritime stuff as well as real working-man stuff. Who's better - Stan Rogers or Gordon Lightfoot? Lightfoot is prettier, but Rogers is more powerful by far and away. Check out Black Swan in Vancouver, BC for Harris and the Mare on the ""Poetic License"" CD."
4,A good selection of Rogers' work,"Fogarty's Cove contains a wide selection of music. Although nearly all is in the ""folk music"" style, themes range from the humorous, (Ripper Rock), to the upbeat (Watchin the Apples Grow) to the contemplative musings on a past that is gone (several tunes). Popular with those who like folk music and sea songs."
5,Stan Rogers Rules,"After seeing & hearing Stan Rogers many years ago, and searching for this vinyl with no luck, thank you whoever rereleased this to cd. A major THANK YOU to you. An extremely fine piece of music for anyones collection. I really couldn't say what my favorite track is, because the whole is so important that they all fit exactly. I find if I just hear a song my brain starts to call the next automatically."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I WAS HOPING BUT STILL A BIT CATCHY,"A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE THIS ALBUM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HATE IT. I'M ONE OF THE FEW WHO SAYS IT'S PRETTY AVERAGE. SONGS LIKE STRANGLE YOU AND PETER BRADY SHOW THE SW THAT I LOVE. BUT I,ROBOT AND LEATHER JACKET ARE PRETTY AVERAGE SONGS WITH NO THRILL AT ALL. I WOULDN'T RECOMEND GETTING THIS ALBUM FIRST BUT AT LEAST IT STILL PROVIDES SOME GOOD TUNES.(LOOK FOR MY OTHER SW REVIEWS LOOK FOR THE NAME KOSHER AT THE BOTTOM)KOSHER"
1,What happened to Screeching Weasel?,"Barring two or three really neat songs on this platter, most of the album is alien to those who got used to the catchy, upbeat hooks and melodies from Wiggle and My Brain Hurts. This album is so bad, I gave my vinyl version of this away because I just couldn't believe that the band that recorded such wonderful anthems like ""My Brain Hurts"" could be reduced to recording this crap."
4,Kind of like Holden Caufield on acid,"If you liked ""Catcher in the Rye,"" you'll like this. Different generation, different problems, but same absurdist attitude (much to my delight)."
4,Insightful,"I have an 8 year old daughter that was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa 15 months ago, after watching the 60 minutes show on the subject I wanted to read this book. Mr.Knipfels book I could not put down, he has many reasons to be fustrated and angry and tells his story with a delightful (yet heartbreaking) dark humor. Wanting to know everything we will be dealing with I found it to be insightful."
5,"A funny, human story of rising while falling.","As an avid reader of Knipfel from his days in Philadelphia to his present New York home, this book opens a side of Knipfel not usually seen in his column. The fear is laid bare, and his soft, warm underbelly is exposed. As a cranky, young, old man, he staggers through his life story here- giving some reasons for his forays into madness and mayhem, and offering no apologies for drunken blindsides at the world. This book goes real good with cheap wine."
4,"Sometime depressing, often hilarious look at an unusual life","I had read a lot of this book already when its pieces were originally published in the NY Press, but Knipfel ties it all together nicely with some new notes that really illuminate his truly interesting life experiences. I often wonder how much of his storytelling is true and how much is embellishment, but in the end I don't really care because his stories are intriguing and his sense of humor is a strong and important respite from the struggles with his various ailments (retinitis pigmentosa, a brain lesion that induces ""rage seizures"" if he misses his meds, etc.). I highly recommend this book, not as a story of ""one man's struggle with blindness,"" I think that would insult the author. Look at it more as a compelling series of anecdotes from a man who's been through more than anyone really deserves."
2,For those who think 'barfly' is an adverb...,"Bukowski lovers will hate this book, as it apes the old man's style without any of the payoff. Bukowski haters should therefore love it, as a grim reminder of the late poet's poisonous influence on a generation of writers. This ""memoir"" (actually, a lightly-revised collection of articles from a free weekly paper), with its incessant barstool intellectual pretenses, reminds us that the epitaph of the postmodern writer was first written in those classic tuna fish ads of yore: we need less books with good taste, and more that simply taste good. Add a star if you believe the following phrase: ""The memoir is the new novel."" Zzzzzzzzzzz."
3,No Bukowski,"Knipfel is no Bukowski, but there are some similar themes: drunkeness, cynicism and inability to find a job (a la Factotum).I plowed through this book in about two hours during a bout of insomnia. The parts where he discusses going blind are the most interesting; the others were a little ho hum.I read this book cuz someone said it was similar to Heller's (?) book, Slab Rat (which I loved and highly reccommend). Um, maybe...but not really..."
2,Blindo goes boffo,"If its author wasn't going pitiably blind (or pity-eyebally blind; hee hee, I made a joke) this skimpy book would never have been published. Not worth what I paid for it."
2,Like reading a fifteen-year-old's journal,"Jim Knipfel is an idiot, truly. He's the type of person that delivers stories on characters like Werner Herzog and Ed Gein, very self-aggrandising, and, most significant to his idiot status, fails to understand anything at all. Want to be like Jim Knipfel? Quickly read a story in the newspaper, spend the next ten years watching The Nanny, then write a story based on what you read in the newspaper, and then assume the role of expert on the whole thing."
1,Started peeling within 6 months,"It didn't take long for the chrome to start bubbling up. Now I can't get the damn thing off and it looks terrible. Horrible product. Please take my advice, unless you are planning on selling your vehicle and you need to cover something up do not buy these mirror covers. I was trying to give my new chevy a different look, and because of the bubbling chrome I have. Just not the look I was trying for. Now I will have to pay to have these mirrors replaced. Not good. So this product receives an ***F rating. And a ***DO NOT BUY!!!***"
1,a denali owner,"the wrong item was inside of box despite everything else matching. sent item back and ordered from dealer. i installedthe cap onto the mirror and it looks good, it adds something to my 08 blk yukon xl denali."
5,A British classic: Mary Barton.,"A classic novel of conditions in mid-19th century working areas of Manchester: the poverty of the workers, gnawing hunger, deprivation, and the huge discrepancy between the workers and the the mill owners: rich, exploitative and indifferent to suffering. As well, a tale of mixed emotions, family relations, crime and law, and - finally - requited love."
4,Mary Barton,"What we learn is human nature will out - the world is, and ever was, populated with the foolish, the earnest, the greedy, the powerful all applying their human behaviour to the benefit/detriment of themselves and others. Historically sound and an excellent reminder that history repeats........"
3,"good presentation, a little prosy","This book is in an easy to use format, but is a little wordy, and not as compelling a story as the other book I have read by Elizabeth Gaskell, ""Wives and Daughters""."
4,Nice Toy,"It is a nice toy overall. The wheels are hard plastic but the rest of the car is a hard rubber/plastic. The button for the noises, which is on the bumper is a bit difficult for a small child to use."
1,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed in this book. The illustrations were not quality and the text was not engaging. My children read all the time and will re-read things constantly if they enjoy them. Not one of them picked up this book for a second read. To me, that is a true test of a good book."
5,life transforming,"I am familiar with many of the authors books and CDs,so I ordered The Affirmation Web. As an adult,I was skeptical when I first looked at how basic this story was, but I was quickly proven wrong by my child. He caught on to the direct,no fluff approach to affirmations.It was thrilling to see my child say he liked himself. This is quite a turn around from how he usually critiques himself.He also enjoys the relaxing way that the story is written. It is very melodic. The author truly writes to impress the child, not the adult."
4,LOVED IT!!,My daughter really loved this story. I'm looking to integrate this story in my Daisy troop.
1,Same story: Amazon will send you the wrong item.,"Same story here: what you see isn't what you'll be shipped. I also received the wrong item (candle holder *decorations*, not the candle holders pictured). Boo Hiss. Don't bother ordering, unless you actually want the bobaches... odds are you won't receive the item pictured."
4,Sunday in the Park with George,"This DVD is like watching the musical live in person. If you love Mandy Patinkin and Berandette Peters as much as I do your heart will not be the same after experianceing their performances. If you are not familiar with the painting ""Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Le Grand Jate"" it is an exquisite giant painting all done with pointalism (using tiny dots) to create a gorgeous scene of different people at a park as a period piece. This musical depicts George Seurat's (the painter) journey to create this painting and how the people in the painting literally come to life. It's about beauty and how that beauty is transfered in the ages."
3,Unfortunately no subtitles is included,"the lack of subtitles even in english did not allow me to fully appreciate this dvd edition.The video quality, whilst is clear on CRT display, turns out to be somewhat grainy on lcd bigger display. These exceptions made, ""Sunday"" remains an interesting and pleasant musical, with beautiful acting and singing.Sondheim makes the rest."
4,"a masterpiece, if not an acquired taste.","This musical has always been one of Sondheim's more esoteric pieces (read: definitely not everyone's cup of tea), but it is one of his best musicals and everyone who is a musical lover should experience this at least once. The lyrics are extremely smart and well written, the score is sweeping, the set design is beautiful and innovative, and although I will agree that it can be difficult to 'connect' with the characters and slow paced plot (that includes lots of Art vs. Life types of discussion), it's a very original work. 'Color and Light', 'Finishing The Hat', 'Children and Art', and 'Sunday', are brilliant, and among some of the greatest songs (and most difficult to perform) ever written for musical theatre. And in my opinion, Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patankin give the performances of both their lifetimes. So give it a try. You might not fall in love with it, but I guarentee that you will think about it, long after your first viewing."
2,This is Music?,"A musical, in my opinion, is a play (or, in some cases, a movie) that makes you feel better after viewing or has at least a song or two that you walk away humming. I hardly recognized this as ""music"", let along finding a song I could hum. As for feeling better--I won't even go there."
1,i don't understand all the 5 stars - quality is awful,I can't fathom how their are so many five star reviews of this movie. I just can't get beyond quality issues with the video quality (old VHS quality) and the poor sound quality of pick up on the actors. These are wonderful actors and I'm sure it was a great production - but I would highly advise you of with watching this due to its very poor production quality.
4,Actually enjoyable for those not fond of musicals,"This is a video production of a stage musical, so don't expect some fantastic editing, cinematography or direction. Although all of those are fine in this DVD, they are pretty standard a solid for the format of this show. The leads are wonderful, and besides, who doesn't love to listen to and look at Bernadette Petters!?!"
5,Sunday is sometimes boring for me but not this time,"I enjoyed this video. Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters are faboulous. I've never seen a show that needed so many cutouts. The prop designer must have had his work cut out with those cut outs. Especially with those cutouts of Mandy Patinkin. I'll bet that in other productions of this show, they have to make cutouts of the person who is playing George. It was a bit boring, the show. The girl who plays Louise was sassy in her painting costume. She had beautiful shoulders. If only George Seurat lived today and Louise was in a bikini. They should have rewritten the ending with George talking to all the other characters such the Celestes, Napoleon (the soldier), Jules, the boatman etc. I hope they rewrite it when there is a revival. They should at least rewrite the ending."
2,Sunday in the Park with George DVD,"The DVD was delivered promptly. However, the first time we tried to watch it, we discovered it didn't work."
2,nos pareció muy aburrido,"Nos pareció muy aburrido, aunque colorista y con efctos teatrales interesantes como la recreacion de los cuadros Bernardette muy bien , pero Mandy muy flojo"
3,A unique opportunity wasted,"""Sunday..."" is a masterpiece that deserves the best production available. My Musical Theater Appreciation class and I were watching the DVD as part of our program in a larger than average screen and noticed that the look is indeed VHS-grain, not what a DVDs normally gives; a true pity. Then, when I pursued subtitles, there were none. How can you truly appreciate the genius of Sondheim without savoring his lyrics fully? After all, the CD releases come with a full libretto and lyrics, right?In conclusion: cheaply produced.Thus, we will have to wait untill someone wakes up with the cling of money (if not the artistic vision) and re-releases it, as it should, in Blueray."
1,Insufficient Information,"To the Author and/or Publisher: I did not buy this book because I could not view, at a minimum, The Table of Contents."
2,Only for Kinks fans.,"If you're not a Kinks fan or this album would be your introduction to the Kinks, you should pass, even though it includes the full version of ""Celluloid Heroes"". The Kinks are the greatest rock band (yes, I mean it), but this album is among their weakest. Mostly whining about bad food on the road. Pass on this one, and get ""One for the Road"" or ""To the Bone"" if you want a Kinks live album. If you're already a Kinks fan, sure, you must get it; we must have every note the band has recorded -- I empathize. But this won't be the CD you put on the most of your Kinks collection."
4,A Pair of Engaging but Sad Radio Dramas,"I like Stan Rogers as a singer. That is how I wound up with this CD. I expected music. I got some but it was sparse. The CD consists of two radio plays produced for broadcast in Canada and inspired by songs of Stan Rogers. He provides the music to go along with the plays.Both of the plays look at issues of human cruelty and perception. They also deal with love. I cannot say that either is very enjoyable but both are well done, engaging and even haunting. The music just adds to the haunting quality.""Harris and the Mare"" talks of a friendship between an old curmudgeon and a pacifist. The pacifist is finally moved to violence in defense of the love of his life.""The Sisters"" deals with two sisters, one plain and one beautiful. The beautiful one is blind and in love. The plain one is bitter and extracts her vengeance to the detriment of everyone including herself.The original musical version of ""Harris and the Mare"" is included between the two dramas."
2,Flat and weak with golden speech,"I was disappointed in reading this book. Quite often, Andrews will talk about something so far back in the past that it is unverifiable, and not give any kind of source to confirm that this is how she knows that fact. Quotes with no segue or reason appear regularly, and little is ever fully explained. If this had been written by Thomas Cahill in his ""Hinges of History"" series, the whole thing would have been improved. For my part, I could not find any reason to finish the book, but when I did (at last), I hadn't felt like I learned anything. I did not enjoy it and I think I am unlikely to ever read it again."
1,superficial and written by a freak,"completely crazy book, not based on facts but on accounts from a network of freaks who had dreams...The topic could have been interesting, but this is badly written, no reliable source of information is mentioned, not worth reading, yet ever buying. I trashed mine."
3,It's alright.,"I love getting information about different theories on ancient civilizations, and this book does provide some theories and gives good basic information. It's not a book you will walk away from and think was well written. Although it does give much information, it does not give a lot of supporting evidence, rather it sounds like pieces of other peoples materials sewn into a book printed under Ms. Andrews' name. One thing she does well is cite information taken from other resources. All in all Ms. Andrews' book is a good read if you are looking for some basic knowledge and would like a whole lot more questions after reading than what you went had going in. For better information try one of her cited sources!"
3,Mixture of information,"It was difficult to decide how many stars to give this book. On the one hand, the book was quite readable. It wove many varied sources of information into a cohesive book. On the other hand, I don't feel that I learned very much about Lemuria or Atlantis. The author spent most of the book trying to provide evidence for the existence of Lemuria and Atlantis and not much time was spent telling about life in those two civilizations. I gave the book 3 stars because from the title, I thought there would be more discussion about life in those civilizations."
5,The Best Of Comic Relief 3,"This album is 100% laugh your backside off humor! You will get a kick out of comedians such as Robin Williams, Paul Reiser and many more. I just got the CD and Already I am laughing hysterically! So go buy this cd and while you are at it you might want to look into othe Comic Relief albums. These are albums are keepers! I have alreay enjoy Best of Comic Relief 3 and Comic Relief VII. I plan on getting one or two more of Comci Relief Albums, That's how good they are!"
5,Woo-Hoo-Hoo!,"I actually did hurt from laughing! So many of the strips were spot on. Love it, love it love it!"
2,Somewhat Shallow,"This video only dust the surface on shooting and stick handling. I felt that there was very little information that you could sink your teeth into. It was more of ""this is what you can do"" instead of a ""this is how you do it"" video. Brett Haul's Shooting video was much more instructional."
4,a good place to start,"This book is a conversation starter for those who trying to sort out the appropriate role of religion in American public life. It should provide a stimulating start for a reading journey at the center of contemporary American history. For those who come away concerned, or indeed, not very concerned about the errosion of religious freedom and separation of church and state in the U.S., the logical next reads are Why the Religious Right is Wrong about Separation of Church and State, by Robert Boston..."
4,Pretty good stuff,"this is definatly a good cd, but i would recommend my brain hurts and wiggle before this- i am giving this 4 stars because it is very sloppy at times and ben isnt really sounding to much like ben"
3,It's okay.,"This is what can be considered, for all intents and purposes, as Weasel's first serious album. And like many bands early efforts, it's half brilliant, half puerile. in terms of songwriting potential, they are totally there, but the way some of the songs come off is just juvenile. Buy this album if you are a Weasel fan and want to hear where they came from. If you don't know their stuff, start with something more accessible like My Brain Hurts of Bark Like A Dog."
4,Staple songs,"This album is basically SW signature album even though they have had better albums this is one that helps you get into the band. All the favorites are here like ""HEY suburbia"",""i hate led zepplin"", ""supermarket fantasy"", ""dingbat"". The only bad thing that is sort of a common problem with SW is that they put too many average songs/ lesser songs on their albums so you get a lot of songs but they couldve taken five or so off and the album wouldve been perfect."
5,Entertaining,"This movie had a little of everything. Comedy, suspense, thriller, and even a little romance. Very entertaining. Kellie Giddish was great in her movie debut. I would recommend watching the movie."
3,Did the makers of DEXTER complain ?,"This film works like a play.Really no scenes as much as all the dialogue taking place in a trailer.It felt like a character study exercise for actors more than an actual film.With the main characters doing a great job with their acting and continuous dialogue.The opening sequence was a full rip-off of the opening credits for the TV show DEXTER.Bottom line -- impressive acting talents and character portrayals , but not really an enjoyable or interesting movie.P.S.What happened to Val Kilmer ?Years ago he was poised to be the next big thing, then he suddenly kind of just faded away.I think I will go look that up now that I am curious."
4,A Good First Effort,"""I Just Want To Make Love To You"" almost makes this worth having by itself. Never really cared for ""Leavin' Again(Again), which has a definite Dave Edmonds feel to it, but the rest are pretty good. Overall this album seems a little disjointed compared to the next three albums they would do, but figured that they had not yet hit their stride after leaving Savoy Brown. Rod Price is definitely not as strong as he would be on the future albums, but you care hear him developing his nitch within the group. Wish these were remastered as most of the early CD's are missing the ""boom"" that takes you on that Free Ride that makes you want to crank it up."
3,Solid debut,"Foghat's first album showed that a southern-rock band doesn't have to come from the southern U.S. This is a completely solid debut album that pretty much rocks out the whole way through, from originals like ""Trouble, Trouble"" and ""Sarah Lee"" to covers of ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" and ""Maybelline."" Gets a bit tedious towards the end, but overall, a fine rock'n'roll record."
5,Live from New Hampshire,"This was recently recorded in New Hampshire I believe in 2007 or 2008 by the current members of Foghat, outstanding performance, great set list, well worth picking up."
5,Special thanks to Todd Rundgren,"Foghat by Foghat. Headgear for Hairballs. And that's just the first album--they have at least half a dozen more, one's even Live from 77 and it's so good its only flaw is that it's much too bleeding short. Foghat though, and let's just get this out of the way right here: isn't Foghat just a mighty farking name for a band what actually done what Foghat actually done? Indeed still does coz I just heard the remainder of these dudes live on the radio and they can still crank it out. Not just that either but one time I'm pretty sure I remember watching The Simpsons and a radio talk show host interviewing Rabbi Hyman Krustofski could clearly be seen wearing a Foghat T-shirt!"
4,The Festival of Bones,"Mexico's Day of the Dead is a three day celebration where one's deceased loved ones are remembered and celebrated. At the end of the book there are suggestions for celebrating the Day of the Dead along with several recipes. Although I enjoyed the book and the illustrations, I think the skeletons may be frightening or scary for young children. Particularly, ""the baby skeleton, with her scary mask and her box with the little candle."""
4,Deelightful,"The illustrations in this book are what make it worth while. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE mexican folk art, and the Day of the Dead drawings in here are fun and original."
4,Everywhere bones,"The first half is a poetic picture book with stunning illustrations and words in both English and Spanish while the second half is filled with information about the Day of the Dead, traditions, how to build an altar, poems and recipes. This is a great book for exploring other cultures and holidays with children and good to have if looking for another way to celebrate the beginning of fall.I found it helpful in helping my children to remember relatives who have passed and to help take some of the fear out of death."
2,ill-fitting,"The quality of the material is fairly okay, I'd have to agree with the other review. Do not expect it to be leather, or even an expensive leatherette material. It feels a bit plasticky and synthetic, which I'd have to admit is acceptable for the price of the item.However, what is disappointing is the fit of the phone (I have the Pearl 8120) in the case. It's 0.5 inches too loose on the sides so it feels like it will fall out anytime. It is not snug at all as shown in the photo above. To give you an idea, a Curve 8900 fits comfortably in the pouch with some room to wiggle. If not for this issue, I would have given the item 4 stars."
3,leather pouch for blackberry 8100,"Fairly good, but a little large for the 8100, and it could use a belt clip or loop. The picture from the rear made it look like it had this feature."
2,"Good compilation, but...","I don't know why American ""BEST OF"" and ""GREATEST HITS"" CD compilations are always so 'fluffy'. Compare with any good Brit or German compilation, not only the song selection but the CD sound itself is ALWAYS BETTER!!! This 'KIHNsolidation' is no exception to the rule! Why not thinking about reissuing GREGROCKIHNROLLBAND and KIHNTINUED digitally remastered instead? Both are good pieces of the best American Rock'n'Roll!!!Greg Kihn may not a be a rock Superstar, but he's certainly a serious and a good Rock music player!"
3,Forgotten Kihn,"Greg Kihn is best known for his hit song ""Jeopardy"" which peaked at number two in 1983. While that is great song, there are other tracks on this expansive compilation that are worth a listen. ""The Break Up Song"" peaked at number 20 on the charts, but deserved much higher as it is Mr. Kihn's finest song and a great power pop record from the early 80's. ""Madison Avenue"", ""Any Other Woman"", ""In The Naked Eye"" and ""Testify"" are also worth a listen."
4,Where's Roadrunner?,"Nice CD with a lot of good tunes but no GREG KIHN ""Best Of"" CD is complete without the rousing, energetic tune ""ROADRUNNER"" a great tune that SHOULD be on this copulation.........but sadly it's not!"
3,Good compiled in quantity... but not quality,"A compilation of hits one must succeed. Except for the three super hits (Breakup Song, Jeopardy and Lucky) the rest is disposable. Should include ""Rock"" a Beserkley single of 1984, very similar to Jeopardy, but good song that is not achieved."
4,A John Farnham Rarity and a gem of an album,"'Uncovered' is John Farnham's solo album after he parted ways with the 'Little River Band'. It is almost 20 odd years old and is a great CD that is nice to listen too. It is a 10 track CD and several of the songs from this album is on the Anthology Series like 'Help', 'Please Don't Ask Me', 'On my Own'.Songs like 'Matilda' and 'Jillie's Song' show John in the middle of his formative years when he was just getting his footing and context down pat. It's an excellent CD for any Farnham fan and this CD completes my John Farnham collection. His music is simply amazing and as a person he is basically a all-round great bloke.Makes me damned proud to be an aussie!"
5,A GREAT BOOK ABOUT A GREAT ATHLETE!,"This is an excellent book that reads like a movie and should be a movie! Before the 1930s professional wrestling was actually a legitimate sport. It's been my observation that a lot of modern professional wrestlers and fans would like to believe that ""worked"" matches always existed so that they themselves and/or their heroes don't appear as con-artists and so forth. I think this is unfortunate because I think most top modern pro wrestlers are incredible athletes as well as incredible performers. Just look at Ken Shamrock and Brock Lesnar and so on. However, if you seriously research this subject you will find that pro wrestling was once real and so was Frank Gotch and a whole host of other great wrestlers from a very exciting bygone era."
4,An intriguing campaign world,"A well-developed campaign world that centers mostly around Bronze Age rather than the classic medieval times, Hollow World features savage gameplay in a world with limited magic where almost everything is observed by the gods that are concerned with prservation of cultural identities. The world features several classic cultures (pseudo-Romans, pseudo-Greeks, etc.) and vast jungle landscapes. Also very well described are the species and cultures, each with its own section on names, customs, and gameplay information. Also included are several adventures. A good buy."
2,Does not work with Series 2 TiVos,"If you are purchasing this for a Series 2 Tivo, don't. USB200M Version 2 devices (all you can purchase any more) are not compatible with Series 2 TiVo boxes. As of today (01/11/06) TiVo does not have a date when they will, if ever, support the USB200M version 2 device."
2,Unreliable and it broke within 6 months,"I bought this item for use with my Tivo. It it was one of their two recommended USB network adaptors (the other is Linksys 100TX and I had to replace that 3 times within 6 months). Now that it's broke I am on hold with their tech support and it's a very painful exsperience. They are getting worse and worse. The item itself is VERY flimsy like other users have stated. It just stopped working for no reason. I will never buy a linksys adator again, they should stick with making routers and hubs."
2,Crashes PC when ip changes,"Although this unit installed & worked ok, I bought it because I am constantly testing different network equipment on my XP machine & did not want to lose my corporate connection to test them. Unfortunately whenever I either change the network settings or unplug this device my PC totally crashes & restarts. I suppose this bug could be either XP or this kit but either way if I had another chance I would buy a different one. I agree with the other review that the rj45 socket is less than solid & there are some cables which will not hold in place properly. If you only want a permanant Ether connection & don't switch addresses or cables then this works fine. It even comes with a USB extension cable about 5cm long which you will need if your usb connectors are in line rather than side by side because the unit itself is slightly wider than a socket preventing access to the adjacent usb connection."
1,Does not work with TIVO,"Like others I found out the hard way this device does not work with Tivo because Linksys rolled out 2.0 and didn't bother informing customers that 2.0 doesn't work with Tivo.This is the fourth bad experience I have with Linksys gear, I must be a glutton for punishment."
2,"Works Well, But Didn't Trust Door","I agree that it worked well and immediately, but I felt like its door was going to break off from the first time I used it. I don't travel much any more so I won't be worrying about a laptop, but I would be surprised if that door would travel very well. Even connected to my desktop at home, I felt as if I was going to break off the door just brushing against the cable. I used it a couple of hours and then returned it."
1,"Dreadful product, DO NOT BUY","This thing is just one of the worst pieces of product design ever. The Ethernet connector connects to, essentially a tiny little flap door that was engineered by a crazy person. The slightest touch and it breaks off, at which point the entire adaptor is rendered useless. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
1,Serious issues holding connector,"This product would be great, if it could hold the RJ45 connector in place. Unfortunately, it relies on gravity to keep the connector in-- if you even touch the wire, the connector falls out.If you plan on placing this connector in a totally stable environment, it might work. Otherwise, I would stay away."
2,Works but breaks easily.,"I go this for my Tivo Series 2. It works very well with my Tivo and does everything it's supposed to do but the little door on it broke off the first day I used it and couldn't hold the network cable in. I ended up having to tape everything together. So, it works as it should, but is very fragile when you start plugging cables into it. Next time I order an adapter, I'll go wireless."
2,TIVO Users: This works but doesn't last,"I was looking for a wired alternative to the phone cord to connect my Series 2 TIVO recorder to the TIVO service, since I was having problems with the wireless solution. I purchased this USB ethernet solution. I connected to TIVO and was able connect to the service immediately. The problem was the adapter didn't last a week. The adapter broke when a family member tried to disconnect the cable. Also, it was extremely difficult removing the USB cover at first.For TIVO users, this is a good alternative to wireless only if you don't plan to remove your ethernet cable once you connect it. The construction is quite delicate and flimsy."
3,A good product,"I first purchased this product for my TIVO. I did not notice anything saying it was wired, and not wireless. I found out the hard way it was wired. The top piece came off but I fixed it. I can say it is a good product to some extent, but not a excellent one."
3,Don't believe them when they say they have one left!,"I'd love to review this product, but I can't review a product I don't have. When I ordered, the webpage said ""hurry, only one left!"" so I hurried...I also ordered a small filler item in order to get over the $25 mark for free shipping.THE VERY NEXT MORNING, my filler item was here!Unfortunately, my network adapter wasn't (and still isn't, over a week later). But they are STILL claiming to have only one left. LIARS!So, great, speedy service on shipping the filler item that I don't give a damn about. Too bad they can't be honest about their stock."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this product for my Tivo and it broke within a few weeks. As other reviewers have said, the RJ45 connector is incredibly fragile and it's really not a question of if it will break but when. I recommend the Netgear FA120 instead. Instead of a flimsy flip-up, you plug the Cat-5 directly into a sturdy box, and it puts less pressure on the Tivo's USB port. How a big company like Linksys, with all it's money and brainpower, delivers such an obviously inferior product is beyond me."
2,Bad Design,"I purchased this to use with my Tivo. It worked fine till I messed with the cable on day, to use my laptop. Well now the cable will not stay in the adapter. It is flimsy and so you are automatically careful not to stress the connection, but it still got messed up.. Argh! I will probably go get the Netgear FA120 10/100 USB 2.0 Adapter to replace it."
4,Linksys USB200M EtherFast USB 2.0 10/100 Network Adapter for Mac OS X Users,"I broke my ethernet port connection on my Mac mother board. So, this was a very cost effective solution to the problem. To get the component to work, one needs to install two different drivers. Other than that the pop-up port for the ethernet plug is a little flaky and I had to fix it a couple of times. Next time I would purchase an adapter with a fixed ethernet port.Here's the link for the Mac drivers:[...]"
1,Don't waste your money...,"As previously stated in other reviews, this item breaks easily. While I was packing up my TiVo to move, it fell on the floor. The flap that holds the ethernet cord in place snapped off and there is no way to fix it now. What a waste of money!"
1,DO NOT BUY,If at all possible do not buy this gadget!!! It is a nightmare keeping the cable plugged into the little door it has as a connector. It breaks very very easily. Worst engineering I have ever seen especially from Linksys!!! They are a trusted company but I threw mine in the garbage today and GOOD RIDDENS!!
1,Blue screen of death,"Yuck, only 24$ and I feel very ripped off. I have not seen the blue screen of death since Windows 95 but here I am with a brand new XP computer from Dell and I can't get this thing to work ! I downloaded the latest driver from the LinkSys web site and it was not compatible with my new purchase.DO NOT BUY THIS THING FROM LINKSYS. LOOK ELSEWHERE !!!!!My advice to Amazon - get rid of this item !"
1,Tivo Owners - DO NOT BUY THIS!,I made the mistake a few years ago and bought version 1 and the cheap 1/999 millimeter plastic door broke. I looked at the Tivo website and saw that this one was still the only one certified by Tivo. Reluctanly I bought another and found it to be version 2 when I installed - pissed me off and I returned it and bought the Belkin F5D5050. The Belkin F5D5050 is 100x better - no cheap design and connected perfectly to Tivo the first time. I am only writing this to save others the heartache I went through...buy the Belkin F5D5050 and be done with it!
2,Far too fragile,"This little widget does a basic job as a USB network adapter, but its design is way too fragile to be practical. Your RJ45 cable doesn't really lock into any socket: you sort of wedge it under a little door at a 45 degree angle, for a very finicky connection that'll come loose at the slightest touch. And, after only a dozen connections, the door on mine popped off and the whole unit basically disintegrated in my hand, unrepairable. Find another brand with a less gimmicky design."
1,Does Not Work With TIVO,Check the CD - you'll find there that this is version 2.0 which does not work with TIVO. You have to order the Linksys vers. 1 from TIVO.
1,cheap junk,"I have used many Linksys networking products, and I will continue too, but this adapter is junk. There is a little door that opens at an angle to allow the rj-45 connecter (lan cable) to attach. Problem is, that is does NOT securely hold the cable in place.I too am using this device for a TIVO. And while I read the previous reviews, I decided that since I will plug it in, and probably not move the cable but once a year, surely it will hold just fine. Wrong! The first week, I had to reconnect the cable a dozen times.I am still using the adapter, by wrapping the whole thing with electical tape. But I have little doubt that I will have to replace this thing sooner or later.Unfortunately I do not know what adapter to advise getting. But trust me, that you can do much better than this adapter."
1,Fun while it lasted.,"I also bought one of these for my Tivo from the Tivo store, but before I plugged it in, I broke it when the little hinged door came off. I was able to get it back in proper shape, but it was a slow painful process -- I felt like I was playing with one of those brain teaser toys. It's not like I play with the wires behind my TV, but this little gadget has broken over and over on me, and the only sign is when my Tivo runs out of show information. When I vaccuumed today, I found the adapter's door, but I've lost one of the metal pins on the side. I need another one, but I'm definitely not buying one from Linksys. It shouldn't be this tough to make something that works."
1,lame cat5 connector,"If these jokers could have just put a decent cat5 connector on this thing, it would be great. The cat5 connector doesn't hold the cable in, doesn't hold the pins to the cable, and breaks very easily. Support could care less when it does break. Avoid this."
1,linksys usb 200m,Unit would not install on my Gateway laptop using MS Millennium. It locks up at the final install screen. It works fine on my Gateway desktop using MS XP. Neither Linksys nor Gateway were any help with this problem.
1,Bad Design,"I, too, had a problem with the door. I bought it because it was small (cute, even)... but I had trouble getting the ethernet cable to stay in as I was using it to plug into the back of my TiVo. Everytime I turned the TiVo around, the cable would come out. Finally I got it in, but later noticed it had slipped out again. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the door was slightly bent and now the cable won't stay in at all! Right now, it is literally being held on with masking tape! The thing didn't even last a week... and YES, I was VERY GENTLE with it."
5,As advertised,"Fast setup (completely automated with TIVO SR2), reliable and fast connection. Completely satisfied so far (one month) - assuming it will prove durable as reported by others."
1,Design flaw,"The solution to adapting an ethernet cable to a usb connector is very simple. Linksys has greatly complicated things by utilizing a little door that is cheap and flimsy. Yours will break sooner or later. Once the springs get loose, you will never get them back on. If the door does fail, Lnksys will not replace it because they do not consider the case as part of the design. Only the electronincs are covered. I had to be really persistant with them to get a replacement."
1,"Flimsy, fragile","As others have noted, this adapter is extremely flimsy. The case on mine cracked as I was inserting it for the first time, into the provided extension cable. The ethernet jack does not seem to hold the plug very securely, either.Avoid this adapter at all costs."
1,Look For Another Option,This is a tempermental piece of equipment. If (and that's IF) you get it to hold the cable connector you need to be very careful if you move the unit it is attached to. It will easily drop off and it's a challenge to connect it again. Very disappointing.
3,Good Product Difficult Setup,"I have a Nokia netbook and Nokia has not figured out yet how to get their connection tot he market so I bought this item. It works well but the setup on the Windows 7 was not smooth, I had to try twice to download a driver for it, finally works but a bit ore effort thn i would have expected from Linksys"
2,Works but fragile,"I bought this accessory about 5 years ago to connect my TiVO to a wired internet connection. It was the only such adapter available at BestBuy when I bought it. It worked well but the design is poor in that it does not keep a reliable connection and once the door breaks off (which eventually will happen, it is not very rugged), no amount of duct tape will salvage it.I am trying a D-Link adapter next - hopefully with more reliable results.01/07/2010 UPDATE: I have been using my D-Link adapter for several months now and it works like a champ and is much better quality."
1,"Needs updated drivers, network cable not secured",USB 200M ver. 2.1The drivers for this device on Windows XP aren't rock solid.If you plan on physically inserting and removing this USB device save your files first. I've seen my first blue screens in two years after using this this device. I've loaned this handy device to others in our lab and yes it's handy but they have witnessed blue screens too.Originally I did not have any mechanical failures but after some use it has become extremely touchy. Unless your laptop is fixed and your cable strain is just right the cable can just falls out.Keep shopping for an alternative. This device is an exercise in frustration.
2,usb200m,"The shipping and service were good. The product is delicate, the piece that flips up which also serves as the rj45 plug retainer is weak. I bought two and one of them the piece broke in half. would recommend another manufacturer (if you must use usb to ethernet adapter) such as trendnet TU2-ET100. It is not as compact but more durable."
4,Plug in and move on...,I have no issues. I plugged it into my Tivo Series II (Humax) and it runs. The Humax detected it. We're done. Let's move on to something else....
1,Poor Design,"This is a horrible design for an adapter. The ethernet cable is held in palce but a pop up door. The door is flimsy and it will break. There is no question about it. Just a matter of time, and once it breaks it is pretty much useless. I am currently using rubberbands to hold it in place. There are much better and cheaper products than this one."
1,This item is prone to breaking...,"Do not buy this item, it is very liable to break within the first week of purchase. And I bought 2 of them, so statistically it's not jsut me. The first time the door broke, and without the door there's no way to hold the ethernet cable to the connection. The second time, the USB part broke off and got stuck in my computer and I could not put it back together. All in all, not the best product out there. Try instead the Belkin USB to Ethernet adaptor."
2,Linksys usb 200M,"I have been in the telecom field for 42 years, this ethernet connection is one of the worst I have ever seen. I had to tape the parts together so they wouldn't seperate. Electrically, it works fine."
1,Poorly Designed,"Probably one of the poorest design pieces of engineering on par with the screen door for a submarine. The ethernet cable easily falls out of the slot. The ""door"" on the device falls off. You have to fix it often, particularly after the maid comes and dusts around the tv, or if someone breathes on it. I'm buying a different device. This one sucks."
1,RJ connector very poor,Purchased to use with a TIVO series 2 DVR as recommended by TIVO. Found the RJ connector would not hold the cable if there were any twisting forces. Hard to avoid in a cable crowded AV cabinet. Ended up using electrical tape to wrap around and hold it.
2,Flakey,"I used this item to adapt my Tivo2 to my network. It worked, but the connection was always kind of flakey, and I had to often play with it in order to get it to work. Thankfully there are LEDs on it to indicate whether or not it is working. It went on like this for about 1.5 years, and the thing finally gave up working altogether."
2,Doesn't hold the ethernet cable securely.,"I bought this to use with my TiVO. It works fine when it's connected, but it doesn't hold the ethernet cable securely enough. The slightest movement will break the connection with the unit. When my frustration level exceeds my annoyance level at having wasted my money on this thing, I'll buy something more sturdier."
2,Get a different one,"It worked instantly out of the box, but the hinged door is very cheap and fragile. If you look at the picture real closely, you see that you plug the cord into a flimsy hinged trap-door. When the door breaks or pops the hinges, the cord drops out. I had to replace it with a stronger direct plug-in type."
3,caution with tivo,"I bought this adapter to use with my new Tivo, it is recommended on the tivo site. What it didn't say when I ordered was that there are two versions of this device. Version one works and version two does not. I was not aware of the differance and you have to open the box to check the device itself tell them apart. Amazon does not state which version it is and I am now stuck with one that doesn't work. Once you open the box you will only get 50% of the value for return and thats not worth the trouble."
4,its a hell of alot better than a hole in the head...,And less bloody...great disk...tell the whole family...gather 'round the kids...listen to semi ok very loud...sackcloth and ashes is a great opener...ba ba ba ba ba gets on your nerves but then you've always been sensitive haven't you...One suggestion and one troublesome point.Suggestion is to see this band live and then try to not listen to this cd...i don't think it can be done.And the trouble is that i can't take BART out to where you live.
1,Vocals make me wanna scream - and even that's a better sound,"Good riffs, catchy beats, crappy singer! Sorry all you five-star dispering fans, but such a promising band shouldn't be destroyed on the account of one man. But here is a prime example, the selfish, suave, romantic who is sure he has what it takes to lead the band to the top of the charts. Sorry guys, but you failed this time. Come back with a new album featuring an easier voice, and I might look into it."
2,Advertised Size Dimentions are Incorrect!,"I purchased this box based on an advertised size of 16"" long by 9.5"" wide by 7.5"" high. Actual dimensions are 14"" long x 7.5 "" wide x 5"" high. Don't make the same mistake that I did. Read the product description as it is confusing. Also, the color is gray , not black!"
4,Nice Tool Box,I bought this to manage my soldering tools. The plastic has some rough edges but overall it is nice quality for what you pay for. The depth measurement does not factor in the tray. Recommended.Made in the USA.
2,MOSTLY HYPE THESE IS MUCH BETTER LEATHER CARE,"AFTER HEARING ALL THE HYPE ABOUT LEXOL I GOT A COSTCO SIZE KIT. IN SHORT NOT IMPRESSED, THERE ARE MUCH BETTER LEATHER CARE PRODUCTS OUT THERE. I DID A RESTORATION ON A EKORNES STRESSLESS CHAIR USING LEATHERIQUE WHICH I FOUND ONLINE. WHILE I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THE REFINISHING, THE CLEANER AND THE REJUVENATOR WERE AMAZING. YES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE NEAR USELESS LEXOL AND OTHER ""OFF THE SHELF"" LEATHER CARE PRODUCTS BUT WHAT IS YOU TIME WORTH? I AM STILL SEARCHING TO SEE WHAT OTHER GREAT LEATHER CARE PRODUCTS ARE OUT THERE BUT LEXOL IS CROSSED OFF THE LIST. ALSO LEXOL FEEL VERY SYNTHETIC -NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT ON YOUR SKIN. I SELDOM WRITE REVUES AND I NOT FOND OF GIVING A NEGATIVE ONE EITHER BUT SAVE YOU TIME MONEY AND ENERGY AND FIND SOMETHING BETTER."
5,Fixes water damage.,"I accidently ruined my leather belt by putting it in the washing machine, along with my jeans. Afterward it dried up a day or so later the leather was ruined; it was dry and unbendable. I rubbed some lexol into the leather with my fingers. It is now almost as good as new!"
5,Great Product!,"I've been using Lexol Conditioner on my Lexus IS 250 for the last few months and i'm extremely satisfied with the results...Lexus leather is unsealed and a little bit of a hassle to clean/condition/maintain. After cleaning (lexol cleaner does a great job) i spray on, rub evenly with my hand or a towel, let it soak for about 20 min, and then wipe off. This WILL NOT make your seats slippery like Armor All or other like cleaners will do, but it does give it the ""slippery shine"". It does make the seats feel somewhat oily, like the way your body would feel after you put lotion on, but i haven't noticed any transfer to clothing or hands."
5,Supple!,"The black leather seats in my GTO started out stiff and uncomfortable when new. After application of this product for six months (once a month) they are so soft, comfortable and rich looking, the difference is astounding. Buy this stuff!"
3,Didn't help VERY old leather,"I bought this to revive a used belt I got. The belt was in relatively poor condition and starting to crack pretty bad. I had hoped this would make the belt more flexible and less prone to cracking, but it didn't, even after 4 heavy handed applications.I suspect this would be better suited as a preventative treatment."
3,"Ok, not great.",Used this on my heavily soiled leather couch. It did help but didn't make it look brand new or anything. Might work better on a lightly soiled object - so clean sooner than later
2,Did not make much difference,"I used it on decent-looking leather seats of a 2003 Toyota Sienna.I bought both the cleaner and the conditioner and used them as described. Even if they did what they are supposed to do, I did not realize that. It has not made a difference appearance-wise.Hopefully the treatment will help keep them alive longer. Do I regret buying them? No. I do not."
5,Viper and BMW owner recommends Lexol!,Brings the original feel and scent of the leather back.Removes the dirt and salts from use.Quickly cleans and protects.
5,Great leather treatment,Used this conditioner after cleaning with Lexol leather cleaner and the leather seats look and feel much better. Good quality for the price.
3,No noticable difference,"So i applied this according to instructions and wiped it off with dry cloth like it said, but the surface was sticky and left white resedue that i cant wash off."
2,OK conditioner,"Didn't work as well as I thought it would. It didn't do anything for my car interior. Seats looked the same before and afterwards. I think you may have to ""bake"" it in the sun for a while?"
1,"leather felt ""sticky"" after use",I used this as directed on the leather seats in my car and now my clothing sticks/grabs against the seats. Hopefully I can undo whatever it did with a different conditioner I just picked up.
3,About the Same as Armoural,"Much like Armoural leather conditioner but with slightly different odor. This stuff doesn't get absorbed quickly or easily. Even with moderate amount applied it sits on surface of leather and begins to get sticky after a couple of hours; you need to wipe off this residue very well with a towel. The fragrance isn't like new leather like some claim; it's a chemical smell, not as nice as Armorall but close; not that Armorall is especially nice. It's hard to describe an odor but you know that's an important consideration. In short, it smells okay and the smell isn't strong after a day or so. I also used the Lexol cleaner, which gets an okay rating too. Like others say, don't use too much of it, unless, of course, you have very filthy leather. I have used Leatherique in other cars and it is superior but not worth the very high price. This Lexol conditioner gets the job done; lasts a couple months. Leatherique lasts maybe twice as long; the leather absorbs it much better."
5,LEXOL,This is an excellent product! I have been using Lexol for years to treat shoes and other leather goods. This product obviates the need for shoe polish.
2,Left a residue on my leather furniture,"Tht this might be a good thing to baby my leather furniture. While I'm sure that it did do it's job of moisturizing my leather, it left a lingering oily film. And yes, being a homemaker for 30 plus yrs, I used it correctly. Used some great all cotton kitchen towels to buff and then after 2 hrs went back to remove what appeared to be oily residue. Was impossible to actually remove it all. Solved the problem by covering the furniture w/ sheets and letting the sheets remove it while we sat. Took about 2-3 days before I removed the sheets. While I like my leather, I'm not taking this much time to baby it. The remainder of the bottle went into the trash."
5,Necessary for Leather,"We have used Lexol for many years, and have never found a better product for protecting leather from cracking and splitting, as well as cleaning the surface."
4,I like this product but...,"... I have always used it for horse tack.The published instructions do not apply for that use.""You do not have to clean the leather every time you condition, but you must condition every time you clean it.""If you use this product for tack you do not want to cover horse sweat and dirt without cleaning the leather first."
3,OK i guess.,"Doesnt particular shine the leather, but seems to hydrate the leather somewhat. I was not wowed by this product but it did it's job."
4,Great stuff,"Works as well as any I've tried overall (and I've tried six or seven over the years). If you can let the sun shine on it during a hot day then Leatherique works better. But this stuff absorbs better in any other temp, smells nice, Lexol cleaner also works well, and both are available here on the 'Zon and at Wally World :)"
1,Ruined,"This stuff ruined my expensive leather couches. At first they looked fine, then within a couple days it started cracking. The leather was almost sticky at first, and this might sound weird but my daughter spilled some glitter and it embedded into my leather and will not come off because it is so soft and sticky. Since then the leather looks dull and dry. I am so disappointed it makes me sick. Please do not use this product on nice couches."
4,nice,"nice stuff. it make leather more conditioned like it says. what does that mean? softer shinier, more malleable. Shine could be better."
5,Great for Cowboys,I'm using this conditioner on the boots and gun leather I use for Cowboy Action Shooting. I really like the nice protective finish. No complaints!
5,Excellent product.,My neglected and for many years unused saddle became like silk. I am again riding with it. I am very saisfied.
3,Product works fine,"I used to use the Lexol on my car interior. I switched to Smartwax's Leather Cleaner and Conditioner, as I prefer a thinker product that is applied by hand.Smartwax 30100 SmartLeather Premium Leather Cleaner and Conditioner With Real Leather Scent - 16 oz."
2,get something else,"I've used Lexol cleaner before on my Rx7 seats (from the open bottle). This time i decided to get some conditioner on the BMW. Well first of all this product does not need a spray bottle.It would have been easier in just an open container. When you spray it goes everywhere, the back parcel shelf, the windows, the carpet. Its hard to be precise with it.After reading the reviews, lots of people said it felt non-sticky, i disagree. It was very tacky and disgusting. I will get something else to replace this with."
2,"Vile, Ripoff - or mabe just useless","Just the thing if you want your leather to smell like old crayons. Seems to be nothing but mineral oil emulsified in water with a tiny bit of coloring to throw it a hair off white. If you think mineral oil is good for leather, you can mix (emulsify) some with water and soap and save yourself the expense of this nonsense. Leaves a greasy film that is very hard to remove. Real saddle soap has always done a better job for me.Amendment:After a few days the stickiness was no longer evident and the smell was just unremarkably leatherish. Maybe it's good for the leather but I could not detect any change in softness of some areas that started out dry feeling."
2,Doesn't seem to work well for an iPhone,"This item did not lock at all when I tried to use it on my iPhone with the Griffin Clarifi case on it. The bottom opening on that case kept the lock a bit too far out to engage properly. When I removed the case, it kind of grabbed on one side, but not very well, so I'm not clear that it would actually stay locked, given that one side was slipping out easily. It seemed to me that it would just encourage a thief to try to yank it out, resulting in a broken iPhone if not a stolen iPhone.I will be looking for another security solution -- for now I'll leave the iPhone locked in a drawer when I'm not in the office."
4,The picture is not accurate,"Just wanted to let Amazon.com customers to know that the helmet pictured is not accurate. I received the model with the new helmet design, it has the Cal decal on the sides, but also has the triangle on down the center and bear paw on the back.[...]"
1,My deepest condolences to...,"...Hvorostovsky, Ciofi, Sacca, and Maazel. Was it for productions such as this 'nightclub' TRAVIATA that La Fenice was rebuilt? I won't waste your time listing the sleazy details of a modern-dress production that displays more flesh than dress. If you insist on an updated staging, get the Salzburg production (2005), certainly far more elegant and stylish than this vulgar interpretation. No stars."
2,Too naughty production & Medicore singing..,"I had looked forward to have this DVD because I thought this would be a good modern production compared to traditional ones. At first impression, I admit the performance was quite satisfying. But, the problem that I eventually found is too naughty and ridiculous presentation of Flora's Party scene and not so good singing of Sacca and Hovobostovsky. 2 stars for the Ciofi's performance (not for singing but for acting!) & Mazzel's direction."
4,Not what I expected.,I am not an opera fan and bought this because it is Verdi and Dmitri Hvorostovsky plays a lead. I enjoy Verdi and Hvorostovsky's singing and acting very much. It would have helped if I were more familiar with the content/story of the opera itself. There are surely those much more qualified than myself to provide more meaningful reviews of this DVD.
5,The Traviata to own.,"When it comes to choosing one Traviata on DVD the clear front runners are this one and the more traditional Solti/Gheorghiu production from Covent Garden. While Gheorghiu is magnificent, personally I do prefer this more imaginative production. Not only that, but the singing is great and the sound superb. Highly recommended, especially now that is out of print."
2,Rip-off,"Although Amazon has listed Dr. Seuss as one of the authors of this book, he is not!Instead, the other authors/illustrator are attempting to boost their sales by stealing some of Seuss's characters--the Cat in the Hat, Horton the elephant, and the Grinch.This plodding, predictable story totally lacks the wild plot twists and off-the-wall craziness of true Seuss. The trouble-making Cat in the Hat is transformed into a bland voice of authority lecturing about the importance of sharing. Evidently the authors haven't read ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", or they would know that the Grinch reformed at the end and is not the incorrigible villain he is depicted as in this book. Even the artwork is not a convincing imitation of Seuss, lacking the bold black ink strokes and wild details. The new characters in the book, Megan Mullally and her grandfather, look like Muppets rather than Seuss characters.Get a *real* Dr. Seuss book."
4,"""The Voice of the 60s""","Gordon had an amazing voice and his movies were a treat to watch. In particular ""The Desert Song"" highlighted just how versatile and pitch perfect his voice was. The DVD was good but too many duets spoilt it for me."
5,A truly Delightful Read!,"Shana Abe has done it again! ""The Secret Swan"" proves once again why Ms. Abe is a nonpareil in this field. This latest book of hers is written with her usual fabulous creativity and luminous romantic details. The characters are drawn with sensitivity, puck and spirit. The dialogue is inventive, articulate, and brillant. The plot details fill a romantic soul with longing, fulfillment, and incredible radiance. If you are a true lover of romantic fiction, don't miss this one. It is incredible!"
2,More realism would have made it better,"I disliked that the main characters' relationship is based on a deception, which is perpetuated for the majority of the book. This book also contained numerous anachronisms, making it seem more like a medieval costume party. And, I just can't buy that Amarinth would have changed so much that Tristan would not have recognized her at all, even after spending time with her. Also, the ending was a bit of a let-down, too neatly and quickly wrapped up."
3,Abe pleases with this work..but,"Shana Abe writes well, and I enjoy her work. Her writing is different enough to keep interest...however I do not think this is her best effort. I seem to be in the minority...I bought this and ""Intimate Enimies"" together. I read Enimies"" first and IMHO this (Intimate Enimies"" ) is much better. Secret Swan held few surprises for me ...while the author excells at bad guys and makes you really root for good over evil I must complain that for much of the book her ""true love"" thought she was someone else! Find Intimate Enimies, read it and see if you don't agree that it is a far better book."
5,FABULOUS. PLEASE.,"""The Secret Swan"" was amazing. I surely do not know what book that anonymous Peruvian read, but it was not this one.First off, this is a MEDIEVAL. If you do not like medievals, OR ARE PUT OFF BY COMPLEX CHARACTERS AND INTENSE SITUATIONS, don't bother. Read something else.But if you, like many of us with great taste and who know how to spend our money (!!!!!), do enjoy this genre, do yourself a favor and pick up this book. It is captivating.Amiranth and Tristan are intense. They rock. Their emotions are real, and they fully take you on a wonderous journey. This novel is less about action than emotion. There are secrets and misunderstandings, but Abe makes it all convincing. Amiranth is every shy girl, loving a distant dream. And Tristan especially is amazing in his ability to fight his past and change into a true hero. Loved it. Can't rate it high enough.Abe is one of the best, the BEST, in this genre. Better belive it."
2,TALE OF WOE,"Definitely not a ""feel good"" book. This couple's troubles went from start to finish, and I found it depressing. A few lighter moments might have helped. This was my first Shana Abe book. I have another on order. If the second one is not any better than the first, I'm afraid I won't be purchasing any more of Ms. Abe."
1,"Less emotion, more attention, please","This is supposed to be a historical romance. It has a historical setting, but the hero and the horse must have come from Krypton, and the saddlebags are as deep as Mary Poppins' carpetbag. On their journey from coast to castle, the horse carries not only the hero and heroine (which would be abusive enough), but at appropriate moments the heroine reaches into the saddlebags and pulls out at least two hundred pounds more of blankets, clothing, cloaks, weaponry, and you name it. At one point, the hero also gets to rescue the saddlebags from thieves, at a dead run and while disabled! Hello? Has the author ever seen a horse or carried a load of blankets?I would not have posted a review, except that the Romance Writers have nominated this book for Best Historical of 2001. They should have it up for a humorous paranormal category instead."
4,Not bad..fits the bill,This gate does what it says it does...its minorly annoying to take up and down every night and stepping over it can be a little tough. But overall I am happy with it.
1,A pain to use,"I have used a lot of gates with my 3 children and dog. This one is a complete pain to use. I realize it's not for ""heavy traffic"" areas, but even setting it up the first time is a major endeavor -if not an impossible one: my wife, a normal person, just not as powerful wrists as mine, cannot rotate the slippery, stiff, too-small-to-grip ring on the end that is required to extend these. Here's the picture: rotate a stiff ring *slightly* to extend the poles into the wall *a bunch* -the power ratio is totally off. Design should have been: rotate a lot, easily, to extend slowly, powerfully. Then there are two of these to do: top and bottom. I wear my wrist out every time!"
2,Not the best choice,"We bought this gate for my son, who is now 3 yrs. old now. The gate left marks on the walls where it compresses to stay up. He could easily get out of it from the bottom and crawl through. It wasn't very sturdy. One good thing about the gate was that the material could be taken off to wash. Also the round plastic pieces that pop onto the sides to secure it up would not stay in the gate, and were constantly falling off. Needless to say we are buying a new gate for my new 7 mo. old son. Sad that we didn't like this one enough to actually use it again. Waste of money since we did have 2 of these."
2,Hard to use,"I installed this gate to limit my puppy's roaming area. The instructions are not very detailed, and when trying to build it, one side snapped on easily, and the other wouldn't budge, and I had to push so hard that when it finally went, it crushed my hand. Also, installing it is not easy. To install, it says to push in the spring loaded tube, but there is no spring loaded tube. Overall, this product is hard to use, and you can injure yourself setting it up. I do not reccomend it."
1,Flimsy and more of a Hassle than anything.,"I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often. It's a hassle to secure in place, and most times it is pretty flimsy if you can't get it's ""spring locks"" to lock into place. It's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth, teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it. And sometimes it's almost impossible to ""unlock"" it to take it down, and you just have to pull it out from the doorway.Only really good for rolling/crawling children; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things, or is up walking around. It would probably give way if a child tried climbing, leaning, or pulling on it.Not very good at all; definitely not worth the price. You could find something much better for around the same cost."
1,Definitely for LOW TRAFFIC AREAS,"I should have realized something was up when I noticed that the box listed this item as being for low traffic areas. My husband put it together with little difficulty. When he showed me how it works--twisting the ends with your hands, I decided that this gate just wasn't going to work. It was difficult for me to turn the end pieces. You would have to undo both top pieces and then step over the mesh gate as it drops to the floor. There is no way you could do this while holding a small child in your arms. It was too tall for me to step over, so leaving it up all the time wasn't an option either. This went back into the box immediately and we are going to exchange it for another gate--one that will open and close easily."
5,GREAT!!,I bought this gate to go between 2 walls below our staircase and it's so easy to use. It tightens up easily and requires no mounting. Highly recommended!!
4,Good gate for wide openings,We bought this gate for an opening that was just beyond most standard gates. It is easy to install and is sturdy.
4,good gate for wide openings,"I really liked this gate. It goes to 60"", no more. It took a little while to put up, and like all pressure mounts can do, it fell once. Other than that, it does what it should and I like the mesh; it's harder to climb."
5,Great Gate!,"I like this gate for a few reasons.1. The house we live in is British and we rent, so we needed a gate that offered strength and support and that also would not damage the plaster walls.2. The tension spring is strong and the plastic cups on each end haven't marked up the walls at all.3. The width of the hallway is a bit long and the gate is plenty long enough.4. My daughter LOVES to press her face to the mesh and act silly but even if she tries to move the gate, it doesn't budge at all.Over all, for value and convenience, this gate works very well.The manufacturer does NOT recommend that this product be used at the top of stairs, and I can see why. So if that is what you need, this gate is NOT for you..."
3,Ok,"Its ok but not good for high traffic areas because its not very easy to take up and down, I end up either climbing over it, or just not even putting it up because its too much of a pain, I think it would be good for somewhere that it doesnt have to be taken down often"
1,Not very easy to work,I would not recommend this product to someone unless you have lots of time to put it up each time or you plan on never taking it down. AWESOME concept but not very easy to use at all!!!
5,gate,I was searching for a wide gate to go between my living room and the dining room and I ended up ordering this item. I absolutely LOVE this gate. It is very easy to put together (I didn't even have to read the directions!) and you don't have to punch holes on your walls. You simply twist and the gate will tighten between the walls. The mesh is perfect for my baby because he can still see through it to the other room. I highly recommend this gate.
4,Good Gate,"This is very nice baby gate. The only complaint is when my baby attempts to stand up using the netting for leverage, the netting has enough give that he loses his balance and falls face forward into the lower bar. However, the ability for the gate to fit into such a varied width is very useful."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This gate is suppose to expand easily to 60 inches to fit large openings. It advertises that you can adjust it to with ease. It is suppose to be pressure-mounted. They say it is easy to move and will not damage door frames. It is all a lie. The gate is impossible to expand and/or make smaller. You CANNOT move it with ease once it is pressure mounted. And, when we tried to remove it from the wall - it left a hole the size of a tennis ball.It is a poorly constructed, horrible gate. Our gate was defective since it cannot be made longer or shorter. We have tried to get in touch with customer service to return the gate and no one has called us back. RUN - DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS VENDOR - choose another gate!!!!"
1,Ordered a baby gate and recieved a backpack?,"I cant comment on if this gate is great or not because I received a backpack instead. Why? I have no clue. Amazon was less than helpful. I had to box it back up and take it to the post office, they would not send me a call tag. Also if the backpack that I didnt order wasnt back in their office in 30 days they would charge me for both the baby gate that I hadnt recieved and the backpack that I never wanted? Doesnt seem fair to me. So needless to say that backpack was out of my home the next day. I didnt want to worry about getting a second backpack so I had them refund my credit card. I still cant see how the 2 could be confused. Very unhappy customer. Good luck everyone"
4,Cost effective but lack in some features,"We found that this product is definitely worth for the money. However, we also found that it is lacking some features.1) Removing and installing again is not that straight forward.2) It acts more like a barrier than a gate."
4,great baby/pet gate,"i purchased this gate, because it would be removable for use in a vacation rental on the porch. it worked out great, except for my mistake in thinking the porch opening was larger than it actually was. i also would have liked to have been able to take it apart for traveling, and i was unable to do so."
3,not suitable for little puppies,This is probably a great product for babies (which it is intended for) but hasn't worked very well for our yorkie puppy - he is really determined to get through any barrier we set up for him and chewed through the mesh in no time at all.
4,Great for wide spaces,"This is great for wide openings. I would not use this for an opening that is used frequently as it does not have easy access to get through (for an adult). You can step over it but it's a bit tall for someone who is short like me. For the price, it's a great buy!!!This was easy to put together and eventhough it wasn't sent from Amazon, I got it in just a couple of days."
4,Very pleased overall,"The gate wasn't quite as easy to use as I'd hoped, given the item information and the other reviews here. I found it difficult to match the tightness of the top bar with the bottom one, and as a result have unequal tension.That said, I bought this to keep my little guy away from the fireplace (we haven't used it since he was born--I'm sure the mesh isn't heatproof!), and it's worked like a charm. We'll probably leave it up until he's about three, and while it's not wildly attractive, it blends in well enough that it's easy to forget the gate is there. And my son's forgotten about the interesting fake ashes in the hearth. It's a win-win situation. Keeps the cats out, too.Not perfect, but definitely a good product, and I'm still very glad to have bought it."
3,My 25 month old jumps this,"It worked pretty well for a long time and it was easy to install. We installed 2 by the stairs. I tripped over it and it fell, but i guess thats to be expected. I liked it lots until my 25-month old figured out how to climb it, by holding on to the stair-rails. Hes a little acrobat though. This might apply to all gates though, but had to dock it a couple for that. My kid does routinely climb in and out of his crib too, so hes hard to hold down in one place."
4,Fast set up and easy use,"The gate was easily set up and put in place. It keeps the baby and the dog out of the kitchen. The netting could have been more resilient, we already have aquired a hole from haveing to climb over it. It would have been much better if it could have been opened and shut conveniently.All in all, it does the job and we are happy with it."
5,evenflo soft and wide gate,best gate in the world for keeping our [...] grandson from getting into places he isnt supposed to. i like the way it works and it is very well constructed.
5,great gate,I use this gate that goes to the deck outside. It fits just perfect and keeps the kids inside.
4,Great For Uneven Doorways,"After purchasing 2 plastic safety gates and finding that they did not fit in our doorways - which turned out to be quite uneven! We came across this gate and LOVED it!It is sucure enough to handle a 3 year old practicing her ""back-bends"" on (she's a dare-devil! but has yet to pull it down, thank god!) and yet simple enough for adults to remove from the door way.This gate has also been great for the wide doorways from the kitchen to the living room. I wouldn't recommend it for use at the top of stairs, but definitely a great gate to buy!"
4,You can put it anywhere,"This gate is good because you can move it anywhere in the house just by turning a knob. No screws, etc. The only problem is that the net is loose if the gate is placed in a smaller doorway, so the baby tries to walk through it (it looks funny). Not a good gate for stairways, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. A good buy however."
3,Worked for a week then broke...,"These worked great for about a week then one day when I was rolling my window up the lower back corner broke off the passenger side visor. About a week after that the driver's side did the same thing. I've always been a fan of the WeatherTech visors. I even had these units on a Gen III Dodge ram and they fit much better and seemed to be of a higher quality. These units were for a 11' Silverado and were not as ""nice"" and definitely never fit as well. I don't know if I got a bad batch or if the quality is slipping. I may investigate other options the next time I purchase vent visors after this experience.FWIW: Even with the corner broken and the poor fit, they still work and are quiet. I can have the window rolled 1/3 down in the rain and I stay dry inside."
4,Strong 2nd effort highly recommended.,"This is a strong second course from the Dolls; highly recommended. I've come to the Dresden Dolls a bit late, so much of what can be said has been. I can say the (4&5 star) reviews are on the money about the album. ""Yes, Virginia"" the 1st part of the Dolls second album is more mainstream; ""No, Virgina"" being the 2nd/""B Side"". It is a more polished sounding album than the first and also strikes me as being less theatrical. While the production and sounds may have a new glossy presentation, the lyrics, music and performances from both Amanda and Brian are superb and meet or exceed expectations. I consider this a good sign; the 2nd album is both familiar and new."
2,Sophomore Slump,"Yikes! This is pretty bad. I'm a big fan of the first album, but something is really lacking on this one. The lyrical wit is still there, and some of the piano work is nice...but the vocals are grating, and most of the songs are either irritating or uninteresting.I expected a great second album, or at least a decent one, but this just isn't it. I've come back to it a few times, hoping it would grow on me, but no luck. I'm pretty surprised...hopefully they'll improve with their next release, but I definitely wouldn't buy another Dresden Dolls album without hearing it first."
2,"""What? You're not into the Dolls?!""","Ah, yes... The Dresden Dolls. A band only a rock critic and name checking hipsters could love.The term ""cabaret punk"" is being thrown about in almost every review of the band's music. It is more like just ""cabaret"" as in Cabaret the musical and movie. The Dolls are seemingly in love with Germany's Weimar Republic of the 1920s, in love with it's sex, it's gender bending, it's decadence and it's dark carnival atmosphere. The bands execution of the music is pitch perfect... for an off-broadway musical. For a rock and/or punk record a lot is left to be desired.Kudos to the ""Dolls"" for single handily inventing a new genre term for the rock music critical lexicon. By all means buy this if you are a fan of the musical ""Cabaret"" or Bertolt Brecht, all others beware."
2,What the equation is,"After listening to this I decided it's a cross between Aimee Mann and Justine Frischmann of Elastica, but with pianos taking the places of guitars. Decent enough, though I won't be listening to it ever again."
5,Sucessful Sophomore Album,"Those who fell in love with Amanda Palmer and Brian Viglione's break-out self-titled debut will not be disappointed by ""Yes, Virginia"". Their musical style appears to have been reinvigorated by a deeper rock edge, possibly influenced by their recent tour with Nine Inch Nails.Their self-titled was good because of its catchy, cabaret songs and intriguing lyrics. ""Yes Virginia"" builds on this and surpasses their prior effort. Every song is a rhythmically constructed poem, starting with ""Sex Changes"" where Palmer spits out the words to her angry ballad. As a whole, the album feels like a complete effort with very little filler. Some songs took a little to grow on me but they all have their charm.As an added bonus, the case itself is very nice and is full of artwork. Palmer is a big fan of the arts, especially stage, so it fits the feel of the CD nicely."
5,A Masterpiece,"Before I bought this cd I did not like, ""The Dresden Dolls,"" the only reason I bought this was because, ""Sing"" was on it, and I believe it to be a very powerful song. After listening to, ""Sing"" 50 times in a row I explored the rest of the cd and found it quite enjoyable. This group reminds me of two other groups that I love, ""The White Stripes,"" and ""Tori Amos"". Great songs on this cd are, ""Sex Changes,"" ""Backstabber,"" ""Delilah,"" ""Dirty Business,"" ""Mrs. O,"" ""Shores of California,"" ""Mandy Goes To Med School,"" and ""Sing"". This cd fluccuates between beautiful slow melodies with strong moving vocals and fun fast paced rythems. The words are meaningful, songs tightly bound and strongly structured, and finally a prominent display of accomplishment due to the group playing so many different instruments and only having two people."
3,"Love the `Dolls, but this is a weaker album than the first.","I won't get deep into this review, but I have to say this was a little disappointing after their first album was so amazing to me. This one just seems like another dip in the well. They don't take any risks this time out, and some of the songs are actually a bit droning and dull.I still LIKE this CD, but it's not among my favorites. I hope the Dresden Dolls keep making music, but I also hope they step out of the formulaic rut they've gotten themselves into. They need to expand their musical repertoire a bit if they want to remain interesting and relevant on their next release.I suggest you borrow this one first, and give it a listen before dropping the cash on it right away."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"This is intelligent pop music that is much more accessible than I could've imagined seeing their odd image and known sexual references and sound. As an album this is solid and better than a majority of what passes for original pop music out there. Here we have truly heartwrenching stories about abuse, love, sex, caring, friendship, and with androgynous sounding vocals to boot. At first, I thought I'd find the duo approach to be spare, but considering I like the Mates of State, I decided to give this a shot and while they have a darker sound altogether, I like it a lot and the artifice apparent is nice. I'd recommend this to open-minded folk who enjoy thought provoking themes in music."
5,One of the best collections around!,"If you love the music of the 50s,60s & early 70s,as I do,then this is the collection for you. Tommy James & The Shondells made some really great music. I especially love""I think We're Alone Now"",""Crimson & Clover""and""Crystal Blue Persuasion""-all are beautiful. The rest of the collection is great,too. I highly recommend that you buy this-you'll love it!"
3,HANKY PANKY,"The Hnky Panky on this MP3 album is NOT the Hanky Panky that played on my radio back in 1966. That had a strong, twangin guitar solo in the middle. This does not. While I'm at it, the Hanky Panky (US Version) listed at amazon.com is this bogus version.Thought everyone should know."
4,History of A Great Group,The history of this group is not questioned. This is a great CD to own and the songs are wonderful. A must to have.
5,The Best Tommy James compilation you can get,"If you're looking for a Tommy James and the Shondells compilation, this is the one to get! It has all of the hits and some minor hits, as well, it's the most complete compilation you're going to find. If you love 60's pop/rock music, you will love this. The sound is great, as well. Great linear notes, too."
5,Dependable Quality,"I purchased this item because, I have many years experience with Uncle Mike's products. Over the years I have learned ""you can depend on quality"" with them. This holster was purchased for a S&W; 44 Pro Hunter and it fits the gun as it was intended. And for the price you cannot beat it. Thanks Uncle Mike's, for a great product.Jim Hammond[..]"
4,Project Pope,"Very interesting and very clever. Interesting, because Simak presents new insights in the longstanding debate between theology and science, faith and knowledge. Clever, because Simak's characters and their worlds are breathtakingly imaginative. He peoples his planet, the End of Nothing, with a variety of fascinating creatures, from robot cardinals to a computer pope to a sentient cloud of molecules. All have souls and all seek the truth. In many ways, this novel reminds me of C.S. Lewis -- had Lewis not been so sure of himself and his theology."
4,"Not exciting, but totally fascinating.","In this book, Simak explores ideas about what it means to be human, mankind's search for knowledge, the need for spiritual fulfillment, and what ultimately brings us happiness. Heavy stuff for a science fiction novel, and this is a great book to handle it.This was the first of Simak's books I read, and it inspired me to immediately look for more. I think it's a real page-turner for the intellectual set and if you're into books where there isn't a lot of action but there's plenty to think about, you'll love this one.My one caveat is that the ending is a bit weak - I was left with the feeling that while the most vital elements of the plot had been resolved, the story could easily have gone on for another thousand pages or so. Perhaps Simak didn't do a good job of bringing conclusiveness to the end of the book, or perhaps he just created such an interesting story that I was left craving more, it's hard to say."
3,Robot Religion,"I have to think the the sanitized robots in this novel arebased on Asimov types. In an era when robots are being prepared to be used in wars and build cars, we seem to see things differently.As microprocessor power goes up and the remote Mars probes are proving long term success for robots is possible, wiil actual Robot AI really be possible in the futureand will robotics continue to ignore Asimov as it does today?The novel makes some interesting points about a future whenreligion exists beside science in a space expanded mode.""Heaven"" and technology may be confused..."
2,a painful read,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read.It has a few interesting ideas in it but is largely ruined by his hackneyed view of robots. They seem no different than humans other than that they are cautious and methodical.Simak also decides to throw a love story in. Hell, why not?Really bad lines like ""Oh, Jason, I've been running, running all my life"" had me cringing.Avoid this piece of trash and read City by the same author. Much more worth your time."
5,Wow...,"I bought this cd on a whim, simply because I'm a big LOTR fan & this looked like it might have a similar style of music. Its a bit different, but certainly not in a bad way...in a very good way! Celtic? Nah...I'd say Celtic-infulenced, at best, but I didnt buy it expecting pure Celtic. I get that ""woodland/fantasy"" feeling I was hoping for, from listening to it!Its very relaxing & very well done...I'd describe it as Yanni (light instrumentals) meets Enya (calm, soothing vocals), with just a tad of occasional Kitaro (guitar on a couple tracks).All in all, I consider this a terrific cd to listen to when you need to relax. I'd been waiting for quite awhile for the next installment in this series...wish it would come out soon!!"
5,trilogy of fantasy,"Love this music and so does my grandson!! surefire way to relax and calm yourself for a mini vacation for your mind, body and soul!!! don't know how I lived without it!!"
2,False Advertising,"This CD is the brainchild of Trammell Starks, a producer and composer of many new age works. The CD has some decent music on it. The problem is that it is being falsely advertised as having some connection to the Lord of the Rings. Despite its cover design, which blatantly rips off the New Line Cinema LotR movie poster, this CD contains no discernible reference to Tolkien. As a matter of fact, the title ""Lord of the Rings"" appears nowhere on the CD in any way, shape or form. The title of the CD is, in fact ""A Trilogy of Fantasy: Part One."""
1,Don't bother.........,I am not impressed at all. This is not celtic nor is it Lord of the Rings. I am not sure what it is supposed to be. Don't waste your money.
4,One of my Favorite CDs,"I bought this cd because it looked interesting and it was cheap. I listen to ambient, trance, celtic and gregorian music. This CD is very relaxing and great to play as background music while doing just about anything. It gets played all the time."
5,WHAT A CD!,"WOW! This CD has something for everyone! Jon Rutherford has a style that is playful, sexy, and 100% pure Texan! He is really a star just waiting to shine! There are so many great tracks on this CD, it is hard to know where to start. Each song tells a story that you can tell comes straight from the heart! This artist is just waiting to take off!"
3,Best Of Utopia?,"The emphasis on this album was a career overview. With the Utopia catalog being uneven this collection is also inconsistent. Songs from the groups experimental and eastern phases are included and really bring down the quality of the collecton. The inclusion of the early tracks denies the set of more worthy entries. In my opinion the 1982 self-titled release is the groups best and only one of it's tracks is included. Kasim Sulton sang lead on about half of the groups songs and only one of his solos is featured. It's nice to have ""Set Me Free"", ""Love is the Answer"", ""Crybaby"" and ""Mated"" on the same disc but there are many superior choices that should've been included to make this a truly ""Best Of"" collection."
3,If anyone should ask,"This album features highlight from all ten of Utopia's album. It's pretty much a mixed bag. Utopia didn't really have a consistant sound from album to album. They went from prog rock to pop rock to Beatles parody to several points in between. Some of it I enjoyed, some of it I didn't. And that's about all I have to say about that."
4,Fairburn Sykes knife fighting,This is a practial guide to fighting with a Fairburn Sykes or Stiletto knife. This is a short and to the point. It could have been made better with addition of Kali and routines
2,Disappointing,"""Slash & Thrust"" by this same author was better -- even though there were a few minor errors, it contained a lot of useful information for the novice.""Blade Master"", however, was a disappointment. Very few illustrations, longwinded and dull text, and the few illustrations provided were not easy to understand. The author purports to go into various methods of cutting and thrusting in far more detail than his first book, but he sticks to the 6 basic moves from the first book and barely expands upon the concepts at all.Sanchez provides details for constructing several simple training targets for cutting drills (basically, a strip of newspaper hanging from a string, a thread, and a tightly rolled newspaper), which may be useful for some. His chapter on ""Deviant Styles"" briefly discusses how some people tend to attack with a knife, and weaknesses he has observed which may be exploited.With a title like ""Blade Master"" I expected far more than this thin book provided."
1,Who thought knife fighting could be boring?,"I think my review title says it all. Maybe it's just me but I read this and really didn't come away with anything. I found the writing style somewhat pompous and the material presented somewhat ""academic""-i.e. not a product of the real world. The author does have some good words to say about the military stance (though he doesn't offer any real counters to it-which was his point) and the use of newspaper targets has some merit, but none of this is rocket science. There are better instructive books out there."
5,LISTEN UP PUNKS,HEY HEY WELL FROM 1 PUNK TO ANOTHER THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY GREAT.... ESPECIAL PUNK ROCK GIRLS I LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER ITS A GREAT TUNE.... ITS ABOUT ME OH WELL GO OUT AND BUY THIS ITS JOE QUEER AND GANG AT THEIR BEST HEY ITS PUNK ITS POP ITS JOE WHAT MORE COULD U ASK 4.... I LOVE JOE QUEER
4,This one's got it all!....,"The Queers are a great punk band with a lot of weird sounding but catchy song's, and this cd is just that. This cd has a nice mix of punk, love *in there own way*, beach boys sounding songs, you'll laugh at the funny, yet cool as hell track ""don't back down"" and find your self coming back to ""punk rock girls"" and ""i can't get over you"" This cd has something for everyone, weather you're looking for crude punk rock or just a catchy love song this cd is what you would need, it's a great one!"
3,Not as handy as NAUI manual.,"This was an older printing. Book was scuffed. Printing, paper, and binding seemed cheap.Not as clear and concise as NAUI manual. Still, it's the manual you need for PADI certification."
5,A person worth reading about!,"""I look upon people now not in terms of race...but in terms of classes..."" wrote Tina Modotti to a friend towards the end of this excellent biography. A complex woman with many passions, Modotti's life is described by Patricia Albers in vibrant terms, totally capturing the reader's attention and taking that reader on a journey through the Italy of Modotti's childhood to the United States and finally Mexico, her chosen home. Along the way Modotti's relationships with such artists as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo is explored as well as with other notables of her time. Through Albers' exploration of her subject, the reader discovers the evolution of Modotti from actress to noted photographer to active politico. Because of Modotti's many facets the book would be an excellent gift choice. This is a story that makes the reader want to snuggle up in a comfortable chair on a rainy day and read until the sun comes out. It is well-written, informative, colorful and very human."
2,Dull writing style,"I really wanted to read a good book about Tina Modotti, but Albers writing style is so dull, and so flat, I barely made it through chapters. She goes into tedious detail, and I have not gotten any feel at all for Tina. Fortunately, I took the book out of the library, and will return it tomorrow. Perhaps I will try another author, but this is really a great disappointment."
5,Fascinating Artist and Person,"I love this book. Read it last year, but never wrote a review then. A time when a women was suppose to conform to convention but Tina follows her passion and heart. A fascinating person and artist..."
2,disappointed,"Tina Modotti had a fascinating life and she is a great role model for women because of her independence and strength. I think this book does not really make her come alive and concentrated too much on her lovers. I had read a lot of the details on Tina's life in other books on her and I didn't like the way the author uses facile, pop psychology to explain a very complex woman."
5,quick delivery,I was pleased to find this inexpensive book on Airedales. There isn't much stuff out there geared for this breed. It was helpful and I had a great experience with the seller.
1,Pretty Weak for THE ONLY guide I will ever need,"Could have been much better, weak on the resistance exercise and which muscles for my swing I will work on. Just about any of the other books I perused were better than this."
2,Not much substance for the cover hype,"I showed this to the trainers at my athletic club, and while they admited they didn't know much about golf, they were doubtful these exercises or programs would make much of a difference. I tried the programs for 3 weeks, no difference, so I went back to my regular program of exercise. When will somebody write a really serious book about this for us serious golfers? This isn't it."
1,Sloppy and Depressing,"I couldn't help but contrast this book with the Bishop book, 'FDR's Last Year'. This writer paints FDR as someone and something far different than I've read in many, many other books. He most certainly was ill, he had poor medical care, and possibly he deceived the nation about his true condition. However, he also provided the nation with reassuring leadership and contributed to our war effort literally until his death. This book is poorly organized, but worse, is mean-spirited. Definitely a 'pass'."
3,Fur is falling out!,"We purchased this when our son was about 12 months old. He loved how mom or dad can make it move like a real bunny and kiss him on the nose. He is almost 2 now and treats his toys very well, and I can honestly say that when this toy was about a week old, we noticed some of the fur on the tail and ears just falling out! All the other reviews on this cute little puppet were so perfect I hated to throw this one out there. Maybe it was just the one we got, but it's ears and tail are a little less fuzzy and adorable than they were the day we got it. :( Still an adorable and creative puppet, but I cannot give it good points for durability."
5,Answers to my questions,"This is a bibically based comprehensive study of the Holy Spirit. I found the book easy to read, well written, yet extremely insightful. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Holy Spirit and wondering about his purpose and role in the trinity."
5,Book Review,This book on The Holy Spirit is by far the best I have ever read on this subject. The subject is presented in depth by the author and from perspectives of other writers. Quotations are skillfuly woven into the text as to give a clear and easy to follow understanding of the point.
4,Casio watch,"This is a little fancier than their black plastic watch, but the band on this watch is hard to fasten, so I where the black one more often. I do like the alarm and timing features. I wish I could find a ladies watch with alarms and timers that is more feminine looking. If anyone knows of one please write me and let me know. I must add though that Amazon delivery time for the last 2 orders took the maximum time listed on Supersaver, whereas orders used to come in a couple of days."
4,Wife likes to know the time,"Bought this as a gift for my wife after her canvas band on the previous watch unraveled. She's vegan so buying her a non leather watch band was important. She's also frugal, so the cost vs function was just as important. This watch fit the bill perfectly. It's now approximately one year later and the metal clasp on the band has bent (she closed her work lap top on it). It's a precise clasp and has been a pain to bend back into place. The watch isn't expensive so we might end up just replacing the whole thing, but she'll probably get one with indiglo."
4,Ugly but so useful that I'm a repeat (x3) buyer,"This is such an ugly, ugly watch. The stainless steel-coloured version is even worse than the three gold-coloured versions of this watch that I've owned in the past. But the count down timer, alarm and date features are so useful that I picked it up again. The price is low enough that I have enough money left in my budget to buy a more attractive unit for those occasions when appearance matters. Why can't these functions be put in other watches made for female-sized wrists? Why do so many watch designers assume we need only look pretty and don't have any need for a sensible watch with useful functions? Why can't designers of pretty watches get together with the designer of this fantastically useful, ugly watch and make a perfect watch? I'd pay nearly 10x the price for a watch like that."
4,Nice Watch,"I purchase Casio watch for $20 because I loved metal band and digital display, and at first I had trouble adjusting the watch band to fit around my wrist. Only negative is that watch lacks the light up feature, which was fine for me because I buy nice business formal watch all the time without it. The screen could been larger and included the day and date."
2,why do they not include instructions for the simple stuff?,"I bought this watch and worked through the instructions on how to set all the wonderful features. It was a bit complex but doable.Then I tried to put it on and of course it was too big. The clasp was a bit weird but I figured that out. Then I tried to shorten the band by sliding the clasp up an inch or so. There were no instructions for how to do it. I even emailed Casio and asked but then I tried to do it myself. After an hour of fussing: my eyes hurt, my finger was bleeding and the watch band clasp had disintergrated into two separate pieces that slid ever so easily on the band - there was no hope.I suspect I would have liked the watch, it's pretty and extremely useful, but if I can't wear it, it has no function. I'll be returning it if Casio does not answer my email by tomorrow night with instructions I can follow.I am very sad indeed."
3,"Face is great, band was broke","The face of the watch is really nice, but when I got the watch the clasp broke before I even got a chance to wear it but we knew we had to pay shipping to replace it so instead I bought a watch at target and just used the band. I would probably buy this again b/c even with buying the new band it wasn't a bad price. As long as the face holds up on it. Just be prepared you might need a new band."
3,Good watch,The watch lives up to it's reputation of easy setting alarm. I agree the clasp is weak and comes undone. Would be nice to have multiple alarms but the easy reset keeps me on time for meetings.
1,Cheep Junk,The buttons stick out way to far. It is not radio controlled. the band is poorly made and looks it. It was listed with the radio controlled watches and is NOT.
3,Casio Watch,"I like it. I hate the band, but need the 30 minute timer. Great for using time out with an unruly toddler."
3,Only place I could find one,"My wife likes a digital face, semi dress watch. This is only place I could find one"
3,Casio Womens Watch,I like the watch but the band is solid and I thought it was stretchy...It is to big and slids all over my wrist...How do I get the band made smaller???
1,Casio Women's watch,"I do not like the watch, the instructions are confusing It is not useful to me I am sorry that I chose it.. jane Daniels"
4,Casio women's digital watch,"This watch was exactly what I was looking for: a small digital watch with a metal case and band. I wish the alarm was a little louder and that Casio would compose a better user's manual, but overall I am very pleased with the watch."
4,Great watch,"I love the watch. I'm wearing it everyday. I use the timer to time my lunch breaks, cooking time and laundry. It's stylish and it's great help in managing time. Unfortunately it doesn't have light, and I can't see it in the dark... otherwise, it'd have been prefect!!. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .It has been 2 years, and I'm liking it more and more. I work in a lab and the tests need to be timed, so this little timer is real handy. Plus it's water resistant! One of the most useful things I've ever bought."
5,Casio Ladies Watch with Countdown Timer,"Best watch for the money I have found anywhere, plus it looks stylish! The timer is great, I can move about the house and still remember the other items I am working on!"
1,Disappointed,I purchased this watch for my daughter. Not only is it very difficult to set it is difficult to put on without help. a Christmas gift that did not work out !!!
3,digital watch with metal band,"I bought this watch to wear at work. It's stylish and I wanted a band that wasn't plastic, cloth, or leather. I work in the medical field MRI department. We can only wear digital watches because of the magnetic field. My disappointment was that the metal band pulls in the magnetic field so I can't wear it . The band itself tends to not to clasp/lock in well and it falls off my waist. I might try to find a different watchband that is flexible ( metal-elastic type.)"
3,Casio Women's Daily Alarm Digital Watch #LA670WA-1,"The product arrived rapidly and was what we ordered. However, the watch band has never stayed clasped. We've taken it to two watch shops and said ""we don't work on Casios."" We said it was just the band and they turned up their nose. Obviously, we won't be shopping at those shops again. Too much hassle and expense to return this item considering the cost, so we're looking to replace the band already--which will cost more than the watch."
3,it's the same watch as a cheaper won listed elsewhere!,Why Amazon didn't point out that they have the exact same watch listed under another description for $5 less I have no idea. It makes an otherwise fine purchase leave you feeling ripped off.
5,Casio woman's watch,"I am a homeschooling mother of six and grandmother or 4. The countdown timer and alarm on this watch is what keeps bringing me back. I now have one each in black, gold, and stainless steel. I hope they will make a red one and my set will be complete!"
5,25 years,"I just ordered my third Casio Women's LA670WA. I've been wearing this same watch for at least 25 years and can't do without it any more. I love the easy to set timer in increments of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes, and use this feature all the time whether it's in the kitchen, for parking meters or any reminder. And even with the timer, alarm, etc. it still is feminine enough to wear every day."
4,I like this watch,"The watch is lightweight, fairly simple to use and set. It's the same typical setup as other watches, so that made it nice and easy to set. I like the sleek look and low height off my wrist. The metal band dresses it up without losing the functions that I've only been able to previously find in non-metal bands. I do wish it had the date displayed on the face with the time, but if that was available, then I suppose the face would be bigger. The only complaint I have is that band is very generous in length, and the instructions do not include information on adjusting the watchband, and removing the excess links. I have yet to figure out how to remove the excess band."
2,Timer way too soft,"I bought this watch because the other reviewers were so happy with the timer. I can barely hear the timer - it is way too soft. I will try to exchange it to see if another is better, but I'm very disappointed."
4,Just what I needed,"I needed a watch with an easy timer for my lunch break and 15 minute breaks at work. This is just what I needed. Very easy to use and set. The clasp does pop open easily, although it still stays secured and the band is quite scratchy and rough, but for the price - what the heck! I do trust and like the Casio name and this style suits me just fine."
3,ITTY-BITTY WATCH. BUT TRICKY TO PROGRAM,"It took alota thought to set the watch/alarm functions up.Once in-line, the watch's face has to be close to your faceto see. Runs fine, so far."
4,Remarkably Good,"It seems that Tony Conrad has helped this group find the music at the heart of their formerly rather lame minimalist aesthetic. The album at first sounds like a sampler of Vibracathedral Orchestra miniatures (which is a good thing!). With time, it comes to feel coherent, satisfying, and impressive. I think they're on to something."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"This blanket caught my eye when I first saw it on Amazon, but I had no way of knowing its quality so I decided against buying it. A month later my mother-in-law gave one to me as a gift. I liked it so much that I bought one as a housewarming gift for a friend.The squares on the front are stitched together like a quilt and the back is a solid piece of the navy blue ""micro suede"" fabric. What impresses me the most are the logos, which are patches stitched onto the dark squares. The blanket has only a thin layer of filling, but it is enough to offer plenty of warmth on a cold night.Overall I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. I have seen screen-printed blankets that cost nearly this much. The big test will come when I wash it for the first time."
2,Doesn't fit.,"Despite the fact that it said it fit most cars, it didn't fit in my Dodge Intrepid. My son made the best of it by hanging it on his car seat, but it gets knocked off easily.oh well. It saved me from having to pay $10 in shipping on my $24.99 item, so it was still worth a try."
1,Horrible,"I know I din't pay much for this item, but it has been a horrible cup holder. It doesn't fit in my nissan altima. I have had my drink spill on me several times since using."
2,You get what you pay for,"We ordered these because they were inexpensive, and now we know why. They never stayed in place no matter how hard we tried. They toppled over and drinks spilled all over. They now reside in the trash."
2,does not fit in car,I bought two of these for the back seat. I couldn't use it because it popped out everytime I put it on. Maybe it's just my car but they are useless for me.
4,quality item,I was pleasantly suprised at what a quality item this was. Comes nicely packaged in a box and appears to be an item that would sell for around $20 in a hardware store.
3,"It's not the best, probably not the worse.","It's not the most fancy or nicest cookbook holder. My husband saw it and said, I hope you didn't pay more than $5.00 for that, LOL. It holds my cookbook, so I guess it gets the job done. It probably won't hold a very large cookbook though and I haven't thrown it at the floor yet, so I'm not sure that it's all that well-made, but I'm getting the intended use out of it for now :)"
4,Very handy,"Just as another party mentioned this cookbook holder does scrap the spine of your book, but I had some decorative tape that I placed on the edge that scraped and now have no problem. Took less than five minutes to fix that.I really like the convenience and for the money it is great."
2,damaged product,"Please note that your shipping should be improved. We received the cookbook stands today and the corners are chipped. I am planning on using these for dual purposes, we are having a cookbook sale at my place of work for proceeds to chairty for medically challenged families. In order to both display the book and also to entice multiple sales, was planning on including the stand for 10 or more books sales/person. Now, I cannot in good faith use the stand for that purpose since the corners of the acrylic are chipped away. Very disappointed."
3,Only for Small Cookbooks,This is a decent product for small cookbooks. If you have a larger one it is a struggle to fit it in the holder. The back plastic piece is very tight and angled in a way that it really isn't user friendly for bigger books. I returned the one I bought.
2,not good for bindings,I bought this clear cookbook holder to replace a similar one that broke after years of daily use. This new one really squashes down the pages and it is very difficult to use for thicker cookbooks. I'm worried that it will eventually lead to unnecessary wear and tear on the bindings.
1,Useless Gimmicks,"This cookbook holder is too shallow to hold a book. At best, one can insert several sheets of paper. I was very disappointed as I expected (note the name ""cookbook holder"") it to hold an actual book. I made the mistake of ordering four and gave all to charitable re-sale shop. Perhaps some craft person can conjure a practical use for these. They definitely will not hold an actual book!"
4,Serves its purpose,I got this cane for my mother who has A LOT of trouble walking and she absolutely loves it! It gives her a lot more stability than a regular cane. Her only complaint is that it's quite a bit heavier than others.
3,Wrong dimensions,"The had the wrong dimensions listed. They had the height and depth reversed, therefore, it didn't work for what we needed. Will have to return. Sad because we measured it to make sure and in the end it was wrong because they had it wrong in the description."
1,Not as expected,"I bought these ""extendable"" racks because I wanted different rack lengths in various cupboards. Turns out they are expandable to one size only. It's either 16 inches or 32 inches, nothing in between. To make it worse, they are NOT strong and durable as promised - the shelf sags under the weight of only a few plates, and drinking glasses balance on the shelves so precariously that I am too scared to use them for glasses. Also when they arrived, each set of racks is secured with a plastic band. In order to remove the band, one must jam the scissors in there and wiggle them around to get a good place to cut, yet doing so chips off the paint and rubber coating of the racks- terrible packaging design. Don't buy these unless you want them to be 32 inches long."
4,classic and new Mann sounds,"Though this album is not as radical a departure from the ever-evolving Earth band sound as Manfred seems to think, it's a consistently high quality and extremely listenable album that may be Mann's best since the 1970s. Vintage prog touches are balanced by innovative flourishes (German rap?!) and quirky humor. If you've enjoyed ANY album by Manfred Mann's Earth Band, you'll find something to like here--and something to challenge you, in a good way.Only negative is absolutely NO Mick Rogers vocals--but his guitar work is all over this album, in top form."
4,The most important test,"One day miss malarkey was telling her kids about THE TEST. She told her kids that it would not do anything to their report cards, no exra homework and they would still go to the next grade. Then when the kids were at gym the coach taught them yoga. Then for art they drew something about THE TEST. Then the lunch lady took away the chips and gave fish to the kids. She told them it was good brain food. When THE TEST came everybody got sick and mostly the teahers got sick. It took two days to let THE TEST end. So when they were done they celebrated and they had a sign that said best school in the county."
5,This Is Some Test ...,"Have you ever taken the I.P.T.U. test (Instructoinal Performance Through Understanding test).Most probably not.Well in this book the teachers are getting pretty worked up about it.So much that the teachers are acting strange and the principal loses his wig over sharpened Number 2 pencils!But it dosen't even decide if you go to the next grade (so they say).On PTA Night parents ask Dr.Scoreswell so many questions it goes to the point where one parent asks about property sales going up.Overall, Judy Fincher and Kevin O'Malley have made a great book that shows the funny part about ""over preparation"", and test anxiety of standerdized and non-standerdized tests once you think about it.I say this book would be appropiate for 7-up (kidnegardners wouldn't take these kind of tests)."
5,Someone who finally gets it,"I purchased this book in preparation for a presentation on standardized testing. It definitely added some humor to the dull subject.How amazing that a ""children's"" book can get the idiocy of high-stakes testing, but we in education can't do enough to lower the stakes.A must for any educator trying to make the point of how silly the tests are--or anyone trying to lower the anxiety level just before test time."
5,Miss Malarkey helps relieve test anxiety!,"""Testing Miss Malarkey"" was just purchased by a 5th grade teacher in our school. She read it aloud to her class with an enthusiastic response from her students. Now, we're planning to have this hilarious story read to all of our upper grade classes just before ""THE TEST.""There's not much to add to the other favorable reviews already posted here, other than to say that ""Testing Miss Malarkey"" might help to relieve test anxiety for students just prior to testing. As with all good children's books, there's humor, or a message, for both kids and adults. ""Miss Malarkey"" does this quite nicely.Personally, I got some chuckles out of the staff members' names. The cafeteria lady is Mrs. Slopdown, the art teacher is Mrs. Magenta, the PE teacher is Mr. Fittanuff, and the janitor is Mr. Surley.I look forward to adding this title to our elementary school library and to seeing it be enjoyed for many years to come."
4,I PiTy yoU,"Yes, if you are right on the edge of deciding to homeschool, this book might tip the scales for you.Yes, if you think schools push the test prep a little hard, this book will reinforce that for you.Yes, if you think Kevin O'Malley is an illustrating genius, this book will confirm it.Yes, if you think the teachers have it harder than the schoolkids on test week, this book will prove you right.Yes, if you think the standardized tests are an overly-important part of the school year and a pile of -- well, Malarkey -- this book will confirm that, too."
5,Simple and Beautiful,This watch is beautiful and has a very light weight. I bought to my wife and she like it.
4,Casio watch,good product but the end of the plastic watch band strap tends to come out of the retaining loop and flap around
2,Casio Women's Iluminator,"It does not matter whether the watch is new or used, but it does matter to me whether the battery works or not. I've not had the watch for long, so I am unhappy that after so short a time, the battery no longer works--otherwise, I'd give it a 10/10."
2,What I did not notice when I bought the watch .. Hope it helps!!,"I bought this watch 20 days ago. Consider these issues before the purchase. This watch is good for small wriste'd people like myself case diameter 34.6mm. Considering the 10 year battery life,people buy it to last 10yrs, but the case material is made of resin and it gets scratched easily. I already have some deep scratches and paint has worn off in 20 days. The strap is also resin and so you would need to air your hand where the strap lays daily. There is no count-down timer. I guess for a 5 bucks extra u might get a watch with a stainless steel case. Not a good watch for a long term purchase. That said the time,date and seconds are clearly visible,and it is very easy to setup and start using the watch."
3,bad design,"Update: This watch completely died 2 months after I got it, and I was actually happy to have a reason the pitch it into the rubbish bin. Because it was truly rubbish.I got this because I need a calendar on my watch. It has a nice, large display, but I'll often glance down and see that it has either changed from regular to military time, or else the stopwatch is running. I assume it's because the 'buttons' to change these options are aligned along the edge of the watch.Great idea, bad design."
5,Gift for mum,"I bought this item for my mom as she cant see the tiny hands on analog watches clearly.Good parts:Display is clear and big. So, one can read the time without putting on the reading glasses.It has a light which is bright enough to help one read the time in the dark.It has a Stopwatch and Dual time and Alarm which is great to have.The best part - a 10yr batt life. If it runs for 5yrs I would have got my value for money.Not so good part:It has a circular thing that counts every 10secs.. I feel it is only for fancy and serves no real purpose. Could have done without it.All in all a very good watch that gives complete value for money.Go ahead, buy it!!"
3,SLH first responder/ firefighter,"watch is very compact with many features, had minor problemsmaking the initial time settings etc, I use it for emergencycalls at night and would like the face to stay lit longer,but overall enjoy all the features, lightweight and easy to clean."
3,ok but,The buttons are too big.The buttons are to easy to hit. Every time she looks at it it is on a different thing. Also every number except for the current time are to small to see.I like it cause its the only womans digital watch I could find.I don't know why they can't make just a plain watch with out all those extra stuff no one cares about.
1,no countdown timer,"since it doesn't have the countdown timer, it's not really worth it. I returned this one and got another with the timer."
1,Very cheap looking,I did not like it at all..Feels very cheap and look like it wont last the 10 years.
4,"Great Watch, but...","This is a great watch, but the face is smaller than I expected. I've always owned a Casio watch, and they really do last the longest for me. I bought this for my mom; she likes it but she wishes that the face and the numbers were a little bigger."
4,Good watch,"It is a very simple watch but it is reliable. The battery that came with it is very good, I thought the ten year battery thing was a gimmick but its been three years and it's still working well.The only cons are it could have more features, but then again for an inexpensive watch this may be as good as it gets.The watch band broke after a year, but thats kind of expected wear and tear."
2,"OK for everyday use, but not a sports watch","I've had this watch a little over a year. It works fine as an everyday watch, but it has some drawbacks as a sports watch.The numbers for the seconds are small and below the hour and minutes and they are hard to read, especially at night. The stopwatch is setup the same way. So if you are concerned about seconds or sub-seconds (which are located at the top of the watch face), the numbers are placed in a funny position on the face and they are hard to read at night.I bumped the side of the watch and it broke one of the tabs that hold the band to the watch. I was surprised that this part of the watch was so delicate. So now my 10 year watch is essentially a pocketwatch, because the broken tab cannot be repaired."
3,Had one,"I recently lost my watch - this one, and am shopping for a replacement. My only complaint with this one was that the 4 buttons are a bit too large and so one imparticular was always getting bumped. An inconvenience. Otherwise, I wore it for 2 years and it served me well. I'm looking for something smaller this time."
3,it's ok but not worth the price,"for the price I paid ($18.96), the quality is not worth it. it seems more like a $10 watch rather than 20. it does what it's supposed to do, but again, I emphasize that it's overpriced. you can find just as decent of a watch for a lower price."
4,Very Good All-Around Basic Woman's Digital Watch,"A great watch for everyday use. Easy-to-see dial large enough for instant reading; also backlighted for night-viewing with touching of black bar at bottom of face dial. Estimated ten-year battery life. Adjustable synthetic tsrap fits wrist easily.One very minor drawback: many of us are used to a ""standard"" approach to setting day/date/time on four-button watches; Casio uses a slightly different approach. However, it is well-document in the user's manual included. Covers details in English and several other languages.Overall, a very good purchase!"
5,You should buy this CD,This is Screeching Weasel at their best. If you're buying a Screeching Weasel album for the first time go for this one. It is so good and you never get sick of it. Ben sounds great. Every song is a classic. Buy this CD!
1,"awful reception, virtually useless","the headline says it all, very poor quality, terrible sound unless you like listening to electrical interference and the like."
2,Not what I expected.,The TV Listener has a great deal of static and humming sounds. I bought it for my 90 year old Mother. She says the headphones are uncomfortable.It's entirely too time consuming and troublesome to return it. I will just take the financial loss.
1,Bebe Sounds TV Listener,BebeSounds TV ListenerThis product failed to produce the advertised results and was absolutely a total waste of money since it couldn't be returned. We don't own a radio and after the batteries were inserted all you could hear was a radio station.
4,TV Listener headphones,"I can now hear the TV without driving everyone else out of the room! I can understand almost everything that is being said, and the volumn is turned down to normal levels. Don't want to watch TV without the earphones anymore. They do become a little uncomfortable after a little while though. I just reposition them and keep listening!"
1,These do not work with a treadmill!,I wish I would have known that these headphones do not work with a treadmill. I was also told they do not work close to a computer due to interferance. Now I have headphones that I don't need due to the return policy being that if you open them you can't return them! I'm sure they are fine for regular tv watchers. Maybe I will give them to my grandma for her birthday since I can't use them.
1,Terrible,"I've had 3 major head injuries in my lifetime, and so I had high expectations for this movie. They could have done so much with this topic that it's a HUGE let down to discover that they failed. The acting is atrocious, but I could have over-looked that if the story had been helpful or even believable. It's absolute nonsense, and I wish I could give it 0 stars."
5,Big Storage Box,I had used the smaller version of this case (oc=82) and really liked it. I wanted a bigger case that was not soft sided and protected my gear well when I left the studio confines. The big open box shape and the great price I got through Amazon (Adorama) was all the convincing I needed.
1,Boring Production; Fleming at Her Worst,"It is one of the most boring opera production I have seen. Renee Fleming who is supposed to hold the opera together as the coutess adds little to the opera. With plastic smile pasted on her face at all times, no emotions can be read from her."
2,Beautiful singing...awful production,"Once again Robert Carsen has ruined a beautiful opera with his minimalist and awful staging. Why anyone would want to view any opera he is involved in (whether on video or live in the opera house) is beyond me. He has ruined the Rusalka (with Fleming and other fine singers). The action there seemed to take place in a Motel 6 bedroom (including the final scene which is supposed to take place at a lake in the forest!). The MET's recent production of Eugene Onegin was beautifully sung by all the principals, but Carsen's staging made it a bore and a disaster. Too many fall leaves on the set! I had to turn off the TV...I couldn't stand to watch any more of the nonsense.I won't buy anything else he is involved in nor will I attend any operas in which he is the stage director."
2,Colorless,Fleming is colorless and unconvincing both as an actor and as a singer. She has none of the erotic energy required for this role.
4,Good Performance by Renee Fleming,Ms. Fleming has the ideal Strauss voice! This is a good production that respects the intentions of the composer. Joseph Kaiser's portrayal of his role is a good foil to Ms. Fleming's characterization.
5,Wish I had been there...,"This IS the ultimate Capriccio!! Everything falls into place, and Robert Carsens solution of avoiding the usual and mostly boaring stage-orchestra tennis match is pure genious. Buy this - you won't regret it."
1,"Thanks for the ""Heads Up""","I won't be purchasing this one..I have the Te Kanawa which wasportrayed in the period it was intended to have been written for as the Strauss family requested. The actual performances were done in more contemporary dress and time, but not the video. Knowing this was not done in a later video I would not purchase it since the family was opposed. They were ok with the actual opera being done in a modern setting, but not the video. Most of the composers are long since dead and we treat them as if they have no rights. Richard Strauss still has family that cares about his legacy of beautiful work and his feelings and theirs should be respected. Perhaps they agreed..in a 12 year time period maybe. (the Te Kanawa was 1993) I would not bet on it. Since there were other things that would keep me from purchasing it, like the final scene not being too great...why buy it? That was THE SCENE!"
4,Works Beautifully,"The phone is unlocked, and all the features work flawlessly. Aside from having to contend with the 220V adapter there isn't much to complain about. A local purchase of the same product would cost a bit more, but would have come with a memory card and a wired headset. Those aside I would still highly recommend this buy. I am getting another one myself, and also buying a SANDISK 1GB card and a Motorola bluetooth headset to go along with it."
3,Poor Battery,The battery died on me within 2 months of usage. Basic phone as such nothing more was expected. But the V197 was much better.
1,Insert SIM Problems,I bought this phone a month back and once in a while it just says SIM not found. Insert SIM - only emergency calls. This is a piece of junk and please stay away from this phone..
3,Does not play Audible audiobooks,"I had the Rokr and it played audiobooks from audible. It was large so I sold it and picked up a Slvr. I was surprised that I can no longer play audiobooks from Audible. Whats up with that? Other than that, it is thin, small, lightweight."
3,The Phone Purchase,"This phone is great on looks but has a fewe issues on functionality. It is too late to exchange, or else I would have done so."
1,Worst Phone Ever!!!,"I bought this piece being made to believe that it included itunes, since that was what was advertised on the website. It did not. The phone overall is generally useless. I actually switched wireless companies so that i could rid myself of this piece of junk. My advice, do not buy this phone. Do not buy this phone. I am actually disappointed in Amazon for carrying and selling this item."
4,so like yeah...,"i got this phone for free. before i had an old beat up mototrola phone i had for 2 years. when it got stolen, cingular sent me there newest phone the slvr for free. i love cingular. oh and the phone, its actually pretty good. great features, nice look."
2,"If you have Cingular, don't even!","Didn't have ITunes, like the description says. Makes noise even when the phone is off, for example when its charging, it beeps. Motorola phone tools isn't included, and it costs like $30. If you have cingular, you cannot use MediaNet, and after you check your voicemail, you will recieve a text message from no one. EVERYTIME. This phone isn't worth the hassle."
1,Poor Company Reliablility,"I ordered the Slvr L7 from this company thinking I would be getting in return, what the discription online was. Including Itunes, USB cables, and a cool new Slvr phone. Did I get that in the mail after waiting over a week?? No, I did not. I got some cheap European version, with no itunes or cable or cool phone. It came with a charger that was meant for Euopean outlets...what the heck am I going to do with that in the States?! I am very disapointed with this company and they claim that I can't get a full refund for something that I didn't want. Sweet, thanks for the false advertisment. dont buy from here"
3,whats most important? a unlocked phone or features?,"got this phone on another website cheaper. but here's the low down on itif you have cingular1. the roam icon is always on, even though your not roaming, its just on. no way to change it unless you hack the phone.just makes you worry2. no itunes-its a java mp3 player3. with any new unlocked cellphone you have to program all the mms settings and medianet settings in via info off the web via verious sites.4. the sd card and the hassle of the java mp3 player is not worth it. I took my card back5. signal is not that strong as others have saidthe good.its a quadband unlocked phone :)use any providerit picks up all gsm providers under networks. on mine it was suncom and cingular. you can choose which width to use 850/1900 or the other set."
1,Unlocked SLVR: WARNING!!!,"The unlocked SLVR L7 comes with some German firmware which is 100% uncompatible with iSync, iTunes or any Bluetooth connection made with Apple software. Beware!"
2,Very Disappointed-Not As Advertised!,"Have to second the other reviewer. Did not come with 512MB card as advertised, but with 128MB. Also, bluetooth functionality consistently froze the phone when pairing with computer or headset. Thus, was quickly sent back. Beautiful styling though. Perfect size and weight. Will probably pick up a Cingular branded version and have it unlocked."
2,POOR BATTERY!!!,"I ordered my Motorola SLVR L7 (Unlocked) and the battery was defective. I let the original charge on the battery go completely out. I then proceeded to fully charge the battery and it lasted less than a day. I repeated this process and came up with the same results, only this time the phone would not even come on once I plugged it to the charger. Note: the phone comes with a European charger with a US adapter, so that may have had something to do with it. Either way, I'm returning this unit and buying a completely different phone."
1,CINGULAR branded firmware,"I bought this direct from Amazon, and their ""unlocked"" phone is technically unlocked, but it has Cingular-branded firmware.For anyone not familiar with that, ""branded"" is a euphemism for ""hacked up by the carrier to remove features and replace useful menu options with links to buy stuff."" I guess ""branded"" is shorter than saying all that.This is not a ""clean"" L7. You may as well buy an unlocked Cingular phone from ebay.I have not yet checked all features to see what has been removed from this phone, although I immediately notice that even signed Java applications require constant ""permission"", while an unbranded phone would accept the Verisign certificate."
4,Motorola Rarz Black (Review),"Everything went WELL except this ..... when you get the cellphone .. I was angry because they did not tell me this beofre I bought it .. the writing was in chinese. Now I don't know what ""LOCKED"" ""UNLOCKED"" means .. but they have to realize when they use these terms they need to explain it to people.I am just BUGGED because I had to get someone else with another phone like mines and that took 1 week .. and that person used the pictures and so forth and we worked it out to find out where the language was and we got it to work.However ONE ladt probelm after the language issue is fixed.- When you want to add in someone's NAME and telephone number .. the LETTERS are in Chinese. You CAN'T fix that, so that sux.- Also I CAN'T text either because the letter in Chinese too.So That's the ONLY problems .. I wish they did tell me this though ..."
3,Not an usable MP3 Player,"This a good phone, however think twice before you go out and spend additional money on a Micro SD chip and specially designed mini USB headphones. The volume is set so low it is not usable as an MP3 player."
3,Can anyone tell me how to open the battery door?,My Gosh! I can't open the battery door. I press every button arount the body and I try to push the back door ahead. It still stick tightly to the body.
3,Unlocked SLVR not what you would get from Cingular,"I bought this unlocked phone for a couple of reasons: to try to improve my erratic Cingular service, especially at my house, and to break free from the chains of my contract. On the first count, the phone does no better, or no worse, than my old phone, which is a bit frustrating, but oh well. At least I am not on a contract.This unlocked phone came with a manual in Arabic and a European-plug recharger cable. A converter to US plug was included in the box. Many of the features I have seen on friend's Cingular SLVR's were missing, including the iTunes software. There is probably some way to hack it on there.The camera is fairly decent for a tiny cell cam, it does the trick.All in all, it's a decent phone. For me it's a stop gap until the iPhone arrives."
1,The worest cell phone I've ever used.,"Be honest, my old Nokia 6210 works much better than this piece of junk. For example, I used to get at least 3 bars at home by using Nokia 6210; nevertheless, my NEW L7 gives me zero bar most of the itme. In order to make a phone call, I would go to my bathroom where the signal exists.In addition, the original battery is so cheap, which can only last one day. I need to charge the battery every night just in case it won't shut off during the middle of tomorrow.Recommendation: 1. If you live in suburban areas like me, you should avoid this phone for any cost.2. If you don't have a car charger or you travel often, try a phone that can stay up longer. Otherwise, buy a couple of extra batteries if you think you are so rich.Overall, why should you pay hundreds of dollars for this phone when you can get other great cell phones for free when sign up a plan?"
3,No Unlock,when product was received it was not unlocked at all. I had to unlock this phone myself. Also battery was old and wont hold a charge. The charged tip was rusted as well.
1,Terrible reception,Reception for this phone is terrible. Will not work in my home or at work. My 4 year old motorola KRZR worked great in these locations. Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this phone for a full refund. Purchased this phone based on high ratings from previous reviews. But in my area phone is useless.
2,Not a comfortable phone to use,"This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it. However, the buttons are really tiny and scrunched together. Compared to the razr, the slvr's keypad is extremely difficult to use. I find myself having to hit the keys with my fingernails. Also, it's extrememly uncomfortable to use for extended conversations. You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly. It's not the most natural of angles, so your hand gets tired pretty quickly. This phone has the same look as the razr, but it's definitely not as comfortable to use by any means."
4,Great but Japanese?,"This is a great phone, but it came with not only English letters and numbers on the keys but Japanese too. It isn't that big of a deal because it has English software, but it isn't the software that has iTunes which was one of my reasons for buying this phone. Other than that it's great it does have a music player similar to iTunes and has good picture quality for a VGA camera. It also has good reception. It texts good once you get used to it. It was a little hard at first."
1,disapointing,The slvr is a teribal phone mine broke within 24 hours. I was listning to music but it shut down so I replaced it with a rokr e1 and I love it.I rate it a five star+++++. I love it so much. If I could recomend one thing it would be to not get the slvr!!!!I love my rokr!!!
2,Stay away from this phone,"I used this piece for 6 months and finally dumped it. It freezes for no reason, use the bluetooth, voice dial, sneeze.......... When I use Bluetooth I have to turn of an on the phone atleast twice a day, it just stops working and you will miss incoming calls. What a piece of junk from Motorola.I brought my trusted Nokia and life is easy again."
3,NO ITUNES ON THIS INTERNATIONAL REFURBISHED PHONE.,"Ahh well. I was pretty mad when I got this because I hunted for it everywhere, and bought it for a specfic reason--it was supposed to have itunes! The international version does NOT. I bought a card reader, usb cord everything nothing seems to work.... cute phone tho, but don't buy if it you want it for iTUNES like me."
3,Frustrating,"""The SLVR L7 is a messaging and wireless Internet powerhouse. Support is built in for sending and receiving pictures, text, graphics, sound, and video via messages.""This is in the phone description but i am unable to send or receive picture messages. Whenever i try to send one it says unable to send. When i try to receive one it says unable to down load And i have no idea how to get music onto the phone.Other than that it's a cool phone. i'm just very disappointed about the messaging and music"
4,Very Nice,"This is a very nice phone. Call reception and battery life are excellent on the Cingular network. The iTunes features work fine but it won't replace my iPod nano any time soon. This phone has a very solid feel to it. The SLVR is not without flaws but show me a phone that isn't.PROS:Very solid, slim and sexy.iTunesQuad bandExpandable memoryExcellent receptionExcellent battery lifeBluetoothCONS:Camera (0.3 megapixel is pathetic in this day and age)No high speed data (EDGE)100 song cap on iTunes (not shocking, Apple still wants to sell iPods)No dedicated headphone jack ( form over function compromise)USB 1.1 transfer is VERY slowSame old Moto OS ( Contacts list Stinks)Conclusion:If you're looking for a very sexy looking phone that has excellent reception and battery life I can think of no better choice than the SLVR. If you need a smart phone or all the latest bells and whistles there are better choices."
5,"IT WORKS, HALLELUJAH!","I was really worried that this phone would not work with my service, BUT IT DOES! I am so excited. This is a great phone, one thing that I want to express is that my mom has a black SLVR L7 and it has different ringtones and wallpapers than mine (some are the same). So if your buddy has a phone that they bought from America and you want it just because of the wall papers or something like that, don't buy it. It is a wonderful phone and gets great reception at my house which is out of the city (big accomplishment). I love this phone and am so happy that I purchased it!"
3,Sometimes a phone is just a phone,"Look, it's not an MP3 player, but it does hold 100 I Tunes, it's a phone -- but note that these cannot have been recently purchased as they will be loaded onto the phone but not played -- SUPPOSEDLY Motorola is working on this with Apple, but we'll see. You have to burn your purchases onto disk, delete them from your library and then load them again. But if this is an important feature for you DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. The songs that do load sound great.It's not a camera -- it's a cameraPHONE -- so the resolution isn't great, big deal, it's easy enough to use and apply the pictures to phone numbers etc.That said the phone is ok, the manual is useless. Be sure to store your numbers to the phone NOT the SIM card. Also, while you can have multiple entries for Aunt Sally at her home, biz and cell, the phonebook lists them all, which just takes up screen space."
1,Motorola L7 dead on arrive - horrible customer service,"Terrible customer service - phone was dead on arrivalby anonymous - 02/08/2006, 04:59 PMPros: Would be a good phone if it worked. Unfortunately, I got a ""white screen of death"" on startup.Cons: Motorola Australia customer service really bad. I had to return a phone that was dead on arrival and it took 6 calls, complaints to a manager, and even compaints to the manager's manager before anything was done. On 3 occassions Motorola promised to call me back and never did. They tried passing me off to different internal divisons with different phone numbers who made me re-explain everything. Interestingly, their technicians acknowledged the phone was faulty but that didn't speed up the process any.I'll never buy another phone from Motorola again, I used to love the brand."
2,"Well, it has a MicroSD slot...","I was a little upset with the fact that I had a perfectly fine MicroSD card, and yet the phone did not recognize it. Online help said to reformat it on a computer, and I did reformat that, but when I tried to access my card from this phone, it did not work and asked me to reformat the card, only to fail and ask for a retry.Also, just because it seems all computer compatible doesn't mean it is: the Motorola phone software costs $35 extra.Also also, this phone came marked for Cingular, and was set to use their services."
2,not a night-time diaper,I've used other Huggies diapers (specifically the ones featuring Leak Lock) and the Gentle Care diapers are absolutely not to be used at night. Even changing the baby during the night and reducing night-time feedings did not prevent leaks.
4,Not truely size 1-2's,"Against what I read, these diapers aren't an in between size, they are 1's, and match my 1's size for size and even have 1 printed on them. I do really love these diapers, but they do leave more red marks on her legs than the softer Pampers swaddlers (and they're not even tight).I think both are great, but for softness and for their gentleness, I PREFER Swaddlers."
5,Pretty awesome,"Like many DYI or tinkerers, I have a ton of screws and bolts laying around, usually in cans, jars, or something other unsorted pile. This screw checker helps me sort them all out, so I can organize them into correct sizes, and know if I need to make trip to the hardware store or not. It's also very helpful if a screw gets lost and I don't know what the size was but have one of the same type. Being made of metal, it holds up really well, can be stuck to my toolbox with a magnet, and cleans the threads on the old crusty screws in a decent enough manner. The small size and hard material let it sit in travel toolbox easily without worry of it getting damaged. Overall, very quality item."
1,BORING AND CHEAPLY MADE,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. The 'boys' are with some a couple of exceptions ,not all that melt in the mouth gourgeous.There is nothing worse than the film's crew appearing in the film in a few scenes .Why? Noone wants to see men who are not young and overweight satisfying their egos by being in the film."
4,A wonderful story for kids who like hockey.,"Joey is very disappointed to be getting a used pair of hockey skates rather than new ones. A sensitive salesman tells him that the skates are magic and come with three wishes. Joey carefully uses his three wishes to impress his older brother Zach with his skating and hockey skills. Ultimately he helps Zach's Atom hockey team win the championships. This is a great story for children who often get hand-me-downs. We now have two pairs of ""magic hockey skates"" at our house!"
2,Big wheel serving cart from Cross Country Furniture,"'was impressed by the online photo and couple of available reviews, so I decided to purchase this serving cart, over numerous others I reviewed. When the product arrived, I was disappointed by how flimsy the parts were. When I tried to assemble the parts, they would not come together, however hard I tried. After fighting with the assembly for a week, I finally called Cross Country Furniture, the supplier. The response I received was not helpful. I was told they could not help because all that was available to them was a picture of the product. I was asked to diagnose the problem. When I said it could be either defective screws or pre-drilled holes on the body of the cart, I was promised replacement of the screws. That was two weeks ago and I have neither received the screws or a follow up from the company."
1,"Nice looking, but very poor quality",This cart is very poorly made. The big wheels wobble so bad that at one point one of them fell off while moving the cart and it took 3 people to get the cap off the wheel to even be able to reatach it to the cart. After reataching the wheel it still wobbles. While trying to put the cart together the screws were too small and would not fit through the brackets to connect with the frame. I had to pound out the brackets to make them flatter so the screws would fit all the way through. I should have just dismantled it and sent it back. This product is not worth them money. The cart is pretty much unusabe. Save your money and do not buy this product as for you will just be disapointed.
4,I Like It,"This item arrived in a timely manner, was a little difficult to assemble, but after assembling I thought it was beautiful for the price paid for it. The downside of it all was that the big wheels are flimsy, which makes me concerned about rolling it all over the place."
1,Toy Trolley,This is just a toy!...My wife and son have made me the laughingstock for the whole neighbourhood over this useless piece of junk!...The Finish is pathetic and the workmanship is awful....as i said....I just wasted my money on a big toy (the worst grade from China)
2,"Overall quite weak and not very ""utopian""","""Utopian"" can have two meanings -- the first is an ideal or perfect place but the second is no place or no where. The nine stories in this collection fall more into the dystopian category than either of these two definitions. Only Ursula K. Le Guin's ""Mountain Ways"" was really intense and interesting enough to make me want to reread it. Stories by Stableford, Resnick, Purdom, Dedman, and Sterling were all just boring -- I couldn't care about any of the characters. ""Nevermore"" by Ian R. MacLeod had potential but it was too disjointed to make me feel much. David Marusek's ""Out of Touch"" also had a great beginning but a very weak and rather sudden ending. ""Smart Alec"" by Kage Baker was well-written but very very sad. Hey, how about some ""utopias"" we'd want to live in for a change?"
1,Duh ...,Why spend over $200 for a pants press that has limited applications and doesn't even do the one job it is assigned?Big Tip: for around $25 you can get a clothes steamer that easily and efficiently de-wrinkles and freshens everything from clothing to bedding and fabrics of all kinds.Look for one that uses regular tap water and be sure to empty when done.
3,"Great plot, but disappointing ending","I literally could not put the book down and read it in 3 days. It was excellent until the ending. I think it could have been much better. If it hadn't been for the ending, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,GUILT BY ASSOCIATION,"This kind of book is what Little has done best in the past---remember ""The Store"" (an obvious attack on Wal-Mart) and ""The Mailman,"" and others. He takes one of those annoying little life necessities (such as a Homeowner's Association) and turns it upside down, blows it completely out of proportion, and adds all kinds of sexual and pseudopsychological trappings, and voila, out comes ""The Association."" Barry and Maureen are both frustrating and likeable; whiny and proactive; snooty and self-absorbed. Although the novel takes it time in reaching its totally whacko finale, it held my interest mainly in the fact of all the stupid rules the Association came up with. Definitely, read your association's bylaws before you sign that dotted line. I wish I could have a more tangible feel for exactly who the Board of Directors were, but suffice to say, they do get their just desserts, and unlike many of Little's works, there is an upbeat ending."
4,Horror to the max!,"I really liked this book. I, being an ultimate Stephen King and Dean Koontz fan, really thought this book was up to par. Although the ending seemed to be a kind of ""I'm not meeting my dead line, better wrap it up"" thing, It had a good plot and was so farfetched and original that it actually could not be put down until it the suspense had ended. I do recomend this book to horror seekers, but advise caution for those who do not seek gore or foul laungage. The faint hearted are certainlly advised to skip certain chapters in which graphic violence is used."
1,Absurd,"This book is so bad, it is insulting to the reader. Little must have been half asleep/drunk or just dashing the plot together. I can not believe it ever got past a publisher. Worse yet, it is his lengthiest book (438 pages of drivel)."
2,Utterly ridiculous!,"This book starts out interesting, gets a little creepy, then scary, then goes insane. The premise is just plain stupid and the ending leaves you shaking your head and wondering why you wasted the time. Too bad. It really did start out well, but then took a nose dive over the top."
1,CHILDISH AND UNREALISTIC - NOT EVEN DESERVING OF A 1/2 STAR!,"As I read the back cover of this book, the story seemed to have a lot of potential. However, it was not long before the potential fizzled out to mundane nonsense. The book lacked substance, the characters were not well developed and the ending - well, let's not even go there! As for ""Stumpy"", well, wherever the character belonged, it was not here. He seemed to be a lost soul desperately looking for a plot and, unfortunately for the book, landed here. In brief summary, the book failed to deliver the suspense it initially appeared to contain, the writing style was, in parts, close to rambling and the dialogue of the characters was just too stinted to be realistic. Only robots with limited speech patterns could possibly carry on such an unnatural conversation. This is the first book I have read by this author and, sorry to say, the last. I tried desperately to find something good to say about the book...I am still thinking!"
4,The Association,"In the past Bentley Little has written about some pretty scary stuff (i.e. vampires, zombie like creatures, crazy towns, haunted houses etc....). Now he writes a book about something really scary.......A Homeowner's Association. Ok! Barry and ""Mo""should have moved out after about 50 pages and they (Barry, Mo and friends) never really take the Assocation as serious as they should have. But otherwise this is a good horror novel."
1,Incomprehensible,"It's stunning to me that this book even got as many stars as it did. The characters are so stupid that I kept hoping that they'd get killed. They were far too accepting of all the weirdness in the town, especially Stumpy, to the point where I kept wondering if the author assumed that I was as stupid as they were. I did finish the book, though, so maybe there's something to that theory. I should have put it down right after their first meeting with the ol' Stumpster. If you have a choice, avoid this book."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I can't believe that Stephen King really said ""You must read this book"" . . . it was, without a doubt, the worst book I've ever read -- and I've read a lot.The characters are shallow and their conversations are not natural. I agree with an earlier reviewer who complained that the characters are too casual about what they see and hear -- I would add they are way too gullible. I found it inconceivable that someone would see the character ""Stumpy"" and alow themselves to be convinced that he's just a quirky guy who lives in the woods and is truly happy and content living that way.I also think there were too many gratuitous sexual references in the book. Truly, how did the scene with Anita and Barry move the story forward? I think it was just a way for the author to try and shock his audience.I, too, bought this book because, as members of an Residents' Association I thought it was a clever idea. Well, that's all it was -- a clever idea that never went anywhere."
3,GOES OVERBOARD,"BENTLEY LITTLE'S WRITING STYLE IS AMAZING. HIS BOOK'S ARE SO SUSPENSEFUL YOU CAN HARDLY READ FAST ENOUGH. THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH HIM THOUGH IS THAT HE ALWAYS GOES OVERBOARD. HIS BOOKS START IN A VERY REALISTIC FASHION. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM SO SCARY, THESE THINGS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN. THEN ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH HE STARTS THROWING IN SOME STUFF THAT SEEMS REALLY FAR FETCHED AND NOT INKEEPING WITH THE STORY. BY THE END OF THE BOOK HIS PLOT HAS USUALLY TURNED INTO COMPLETE NONSENSE."
4,Eerie suspense,"Despite becoming overly macabre in places, this novel is compelling and keeps you reading with a bit of trepidation. Having lived in settings governed by a homeowner's association, the basic premise is plausible. We once lived in one where a car parked in front of your residence had to be moved at least 6 inches every 24 hours. People reported our guests for ""violations"" and police were knocking on our door to tell us we had to move a car .... 6 inches! So, absurd as this story was, it resonated with me.Not a bad read, really, except for the unnecessary and impossibly gory condition of some of the ""victims."" The denouement is not convincing."
4,Rules rule,"Nice run with the concept of condo association living and the need for rules and regulations to maintain order in sterile commmunities, in this case to the extreme!"
2,"""The Association""","A good book for passing time and thats it. Story was totally implausible. Are we really supposed to beleive this homeowner sees an armless and legless man in a bloody diaper scooting around in the woods and doesn't try to help? Sees a friend who has disappeared in a zombie state digging a swimming pool for the homeowners association and doesn't question it? Hears a man call his wife an ""C- - T"" and doesn't let him have it? Ridiculous story. Other books much better than this."
5,True and Terrifying,"Bentley Little has turned into the master chronicler of the horror of modern life. With THE IGNORED he took on conformity and the depersonalization of society, with THE STORE he addressed the death of main streets in this Wall Street driven world. Now, with THE ASSOCIATION, he takes on gated communities and homeowners' associations, and the result is a brilliant skewering of contemporary neighborhood life. It's sharply satiric, but it's also scary as hell, and Mr. Little has woven together these strands in a page-turning manner. Hopefully, this will catapault Bentley Little into Stephen King/John Grisham territory and give him the bestseller status he so richly deserves."
4,Good book up until the end,"This was the first Little book I read, I really like about 3/4 of this book and then poof the ending was weak. Its almost like Mr. Little gets tired of writing and just ends his books. He did the same thing with Dispatch. I did like the story behind this book and The Association really got me angry as I read the book. I kept going ""are you kidding me""? Its a good read and definitely worth a look. Im begining to like Bently more and more."
3,The ending was lame,"Well, this was the first time that I read Bentley Little and I must say I was not overly impressed. The suspense that builds at the beginning of the book slowly ebbs as you get further into it and, by the end, it is so predictable that you will find yourself stifling a yawn. The Association is more a social commentary piece, written seemingly from the perspective of a liberal boomer. The Association personifies the exclusivity of conservative minded people (a.k.a. ""the evil ones""), while the main character, Barry, (a.k.a ""the good guy"") personifies the liberal mindset. In the end, Barry fights the evil ones in a anticlimactic battle. Whether or not you enjoy this novel may depend upon your political leanings, but anyone who looks at it objectively will see that it is mediocre."
1,The Abomination,"This is the first novel I have read from this author, and it will be the last. The concept is interesting (lots of people have experience with meddling homeowner's associations), but the execution is dreadful. Horror as satire just doesn't work for me. Awful, awful stuff. The main characters are unbelievably foolish. This novel is completely contrived and works at no level at all. (...) Avoid this at all costs."
2,Laughing out loud!,"This is one of the silliest books I have ever read! If the author was going for horror, he's really missed the mark. The dialogue is laughable. There is barely any tension in the plot. If they made a movie out of this book, the audience would think it was a comedy. Good concept, but unfortunate results."
5,Review,I always like to order from Amazon.com. I have never had a problem of any kind with Amazon or the sellers. The packages are always in good condition and arrive in a timely fashion. This order was no exception. Everything was great! Vicky McCollum
2,Didn't thrill me.,"I didn't enjoy this novel at all. I'm a quick reader, and it took weeks for me to get through this one because I just wasn't drawn in. The characters are overdramaticized, weak and irritating, and the story drags on. Deborah is not an exciting protagonist by any means - I found myself getting annoyed with her almost immediately. She tries to come off as a strong woman, but she is really just a weak trophy wife trying to convince herself that everything is going to be just fine if she just wishes really hard.I also really disliked the ending, which I felt was thrown together just to find a place to end the story ""happily"". The events leading up to the ending and the relationship between the characters just weren't compelling enough to have the story end as it does.This is more eye-roller than nail-biter."
4,Great Story,"I read this book for the first time many years ago and its remained one of my favorites. Thompson is a hit and miss author in my opinion, but this book is a hit."

1,Jumping Jack Salad Express,"The salad express was not what I thought it would be. The spinning part is just fine, BUT, the slicing/grating part is out of this world, or should I say ""off the countertop"". It jumps right off the countertop when it is grating/slicing which quite frankly scared me to death when I pushed the button. If you want just a spinner this is fine, otherwise don't waste your money. Sorry this review is so bad but I was really looking forward to this piece of equipment for myself and my vegetarian daughter but it was such a disappointment."
2,DIEner (Get It??),"My thoughts on this movie if I had to say one word would be ""disappointment"". This movie compared to others was so sad. The main character who is a movie within a movie because he is a serial killer and as arrogant as they come and from the time he opens his mouth, you wish he would get eaten has no rhyme or reason to his killing. He is a ""Jason"" or ""Michael"" wannabe. To be honest, my reason for purchasing this DVD was the title. Corny huh? It was just so catchy and cutsie I had to see for myself. Poor Rose the waitress who spends her night shift getting to know ""Ken"" and has a meaningful conversation for the whole of 5 minutes and I feel she thinks she has a connection to gets offed along with the cook, but we don't see the cook get the ""axe"" (ha! ha!, axe--cook, sorry) but she gets revenge and it takes off from there. I don't want to ruin it for you. If you are a die hard zombie fan, it is worth a watch but don't expect George Romero perfection or style."

4,Good product,"My son loves the battery operated lights and sirene. Compared to the sound effects of other emergency vehicle toys we have, the sirene on this truck is not too loud and bearable. There is a water hose coming with the truck but it cannot be connected to any pump or water tank."
2,Doesn't teach clearly at all,This book was required for my differential equations and linear algebra class. The only problems are that the chapters don't explain anything clearly at all and the solutions manuals don't show solutions at all. The solutions manual only shows intermediate answers and skips all the nitty-gritty. Anyway it's not very useful. It turns out that the book is only worthwhile for the problems themselves.
1,Not finding this book useful in learning the subject,"Currently, I am a student using this book. I am not finding it very useful in attaining knowledge in the subject matter. I find the language obtuse and not very accessible. Besides the reader, I would fault the editor. Someone who is ensconsed in their profession will naturally have difficulty finding voice to teach a subject to someone who is new to it. It is the job of the editor to help ensure the language is accessible to the intended audience. Unless the intended audience is other mathematicians with years of experience on the topic, the editor has failed."
1,Waste of $,"Maybe I shouldn't say that, now I won't be able to sell it. Only has solutions to odd-numbered problems. The solutions are usually just the answer, with little or no explanation as to what steps were taken to arrive there. I can get the answers from the back of the textbook. I have found several errors in the solutions and I've only done 1/3 of the odd problems through chapter 3!"
2,weak very weak..,"I have decided to change my review for this product, originally I gave it a 2/5 but now am changing it to a 1/5. Since I have written the review originally I have picked up the solutions manual, and although the solutions manual helps a little bit there is no getting around how poorly this book was written.The problem is the lack of worked problems, there is on average only one worked problem that is usually pretty easy, and very different from the problems in the sections the student is to work.the only reason that this book should get one star is that they managed to put ink on paper and bind it all together.A very disatisfied customerThe author does not explain how to do the problems very well at all. For all of us non math majors this book is very hard to interpret, I often spend hours trying to piece together the puzzle the author calls worked problems. Its not unusual that the examples are spread out in fragments across several pages adding to the difficulty in readibility."
1,Only bits and pieces of information,"I actually never received this product at all, eventhough it was promised it earlier than planned. I did see the ones other students in my classroom purchased. It has some good helps in some areas, but is not very complete and doesn't help a whole lot with understanding the subject. When a book like this comes through for you, it's cooooool, but this only has answers for some of the problems and doesn't go into much detail to point out areas where you may need a little more help."
1,No Specifications.,"Why do you not give more detail of this, more pictures, showing the information, such as how many pins, and what type of, and size of the connector, what it is made of, and what N.P.T size.You only show what it is, not anything that will cause someone to purchases this item.Give more details please, if you want to sell it to me."
4,Kinda miss this cd,"I bought this lil EP on cassette back in the day. Like most of my collection from that era it was sold to make rent money. I will probably get around to purchasing this again for it is a lost gem. The insightful ""Meet Your Heroes"" and the jazzy ""You Can't Change the World Anymore"" are very good lil songs and when you listen to House of Freaks it sorta dawns on you that luck and timing may be way bigger factors in why a band makes it to the big time. House of Freaks were a very good rock band that never seemed to get noticed beyond the hip few. Bottom line buy this to see if you want more."
5,nice watch for low price,"I ordered this watch because I needed a second hand watch for nursing school. All the watches I own cost well over 200 dollars and I did not want to risk ruining any of my watches during clinicals at school. This watch serves it's purpose and, the only downside is the band, it's made out of some plastic like material, but I purchased a leather band for 5 bucks at a yard saleband I still came out with a cheap sturdy watch."
1,Review,The face of the watch was very dark and difficult to read. It does not have any illumination. The band was very uncomfortable.
4,shagee,I bought this for college exams. Simple and nice. Fast delivery.I like it ..just what I expect to be with me for exams.I prefer analog over digital when it comes to exams since it gives me a quick glimpse of the time left at a glance. Worth the money I paid and light weight.
3,Nice watch but band too slick,"This is a nice, small, simple analog watch. However, the band is made of a too-slick material, so the end slips out of the keeper a lot, which gets annoying. Other than that ..."
4,Good basic watch but hard to read,"This is a very good, reasonable everyday watch and feels light on the wrist. Only problem -- it is very hard to read, the numbers are very dull and with the black background, it makes it difficult to see the time unless you are in bright light.I wouldn't buy it again for that reason."
3,It is just OK,Casio is a brand I like so I ordered this watch. It is just OK as the band is very narrow. I will keep it because it will work out when wearing it with a bracelet or two on the same arm.
3,Very Small,"It's a nice looking watch & the face of it is perfect. But unless you're a small child, this watch will not fit you. The band is very short & I can barely hook the 1st hole but if I tried to wear it that way, my hand would fall off due to lack of circulation. Only buy this if you have a very tiny wrist."
1,Absolutely hate this watch,The worst watch I've ever owned. It is so cheap!! You could get a better deal at the Dollar Store. DO NOT buy this watch!!
1,Good for a toddler,I had to return this watch. It was way to small. I think my mistake was that I went by the picture.The material is really cheap. Probably is good for a toddler. It is way too small.
2,Much less than expected,"I purchase many products from amazon and am always happy with what I buy as in the products are exactly or very close to the description. However, I am sorely disappointed in the quality of this watch. Even for the cost of under $10 I feel it is overpriced. I was looking for a decent inexpensive watch for daily wear. I will probably give this to my 7 yr old grand daughter. It looks very cheap and I will be surprised if he band last long at all. I believe Casio is a good manufacturer but this must be the bottom of their line. I would return it but got it for prime shipping and truthfully dont want to spend more money to return it. If your looking for a daily wear watch I would suggesting spending a bit more up front or you will get what you paid for with this particular watch."
1,No battery life,I received this watch and noticed that it is not working. I have to replace the battery to make it work
3,You get what you pay,"I got this one for my wife, just a casual gift. It was not that great looking, i mean its easy to figure out that this is a kinda cheap quality watch that u can find in a walmart or something.u can wear this for a regular day at work or school. and its been working so far (2 months) w/o issues.The finish was pretty dull, but hey, its only $10 shipped - cant complain much.so u get what u pay !"
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING. THE WATCH FACE IS THE SIZE OF A DIME. TOO SMALL, TOO DARK AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO READ. I'D RETURN IT BUT AFTER PAYING FOR RETURN SHIPPING AND THE FIVE DOLLARS THEY WILL ASSESS ME FOR RETURNING IT THE WATCH WILL COST ME TEN DOLLARS AND NO WATCH. BAD DEAL."
4,"I like it but yeah, the face was too dark","The hands and the numbers are made of a steel/metallic-like material that's why they don't create too much contrast against the dark background. Telling the time in a dim room is difficult because you would have to keep the watch angled to reflect the light on the hands. If that is a problem, you might consider looking at the white version of this watch. However, I got used to it and the watch is decent looking, gives accurate time, comfortable, water resistant and doesn't have that wet feeling you get with those watches with leather straps when they get wet."
1,Not water resistant,"This is a cheap watch so I did not expect too much; however, this is the first ""water resistant"" watch that could not handle the shower!... it is very light weight so I forgot to take it off before getting in the shower and after the third time that happened, the watch stopped working... not even worth the cheap price!"
5,classic,"The Casio Women's LQ139A-1B3 Black Casual Classic Analog Watch is simple, functional, no bells & whistles watch that pleasantly surprised me when it was delivered. The strap is thin & narrower than I expected, which was a good thing as it wears more handsomely than I thought it would. The face is a simple analong watch, easy to read & not standing out loudly in any way. I had wanted a very simple watch that wouldn't stop working quickly(like many I've gotten) & could stand up to a # of activities from work to the gym. I've only had it about a month but I am wearing it nearly every day & so far so good, in terms of working. The last watch I got stopped working the 1st day I wore it to work! If you do not want a chunky watch that draws attention to itself, this a utilitarian but attractive watch. The price was good too."
4,Satisfied,Very simple everyday watch. It fits neat and blends with my entire wardrobe. Love the price suits the quality. I think I made a good choice.
4,not bad,"This watch size is small and great. I love it design. in fact, I have little problem with the time setter button. it is difficult to control :p. Overall this watch is good."
5,"Great Price, Great Look","This is a great watch for a great price. It's very lightweight and has a flat profile on your arm. I wondered if I would like the band and if it would be stiff or sticky but it has a soft, smooth feel, very comfortable on the arm. The only drawback that I find is that sometimes I need a second glance to see the time because of the darker background and the similar size of the second and minute hands - but that may not be the fault of the watch design as much as the fact that at my age my eyes don't see as well as they used to."
3,Watch,"It was nice for a 1 week then it kinda started falling apart, other than that i liked the watch"
5,New sections on Oracle's built-in functions rounds out the update.,"Steven Feuerstein, Bill Pribyl and Chip Dawes' ORACLE PL/SQL LANGUAGE POCKET REFERENCE provides the fourth edition of a popular pocket guide which will serve as a quick reference in take-along tote format. PL/SQL's information covers records, functions, language elements and more, in a new edition that includes Oracle Database 11g elements from function results to compound triggers. New sections on Oracle's built-in functions rounds out the update."
4,"Nice, compact, but it really needs an index!","A good sidekick for when you have a mental lapse, unfortunately they seem to have forgot to print the index.This book will not replace any other PL/SQL book you have (or should have) in your tech library, but is great to have around on your desk instead of the usual 4,000 pages tomes."
4,Good But Tough To Condense,The 'Oracle PL/SQL Language Pocket Reference' is a good pocket reference for Oracle 11g but I feel that this subject matter is tough to condense in size. I feel that this isn't a niche book that really accomplishes much. I'll still give it 4 stars because it's handy but I think you would be more apt to pick up one of the bigger Oracle PL/SQL books by O'Reilly instead.****
2,This can safely be retired,"The International Critical Commentaries were without fail very authoritative and extremely thorough works when first published. However, most are now very old. A few of these older ones (notably Driver on Deuteronomy, Montgomery on Daniel and Kings) are still of substantial value. Unfortunately, this book is not. It has been completely superseded by later works, such as the two-volume commentary by P Kyle McCarter. If you happen to own a copy, it may be worth keeping, but if you are looking to buy a commentary on Samuel, look elsewhere."
5,Fun for everyone,"We got this for my 3 year old niece for her birthday, but after she opened it my 2 year old, 5 year old and 7 year old were all playing with it just as much as she was. There are plenty of food/vet pieces for everyone to pick their favorite tool/food to use at the same time. The dog is small, but soft and cute. I liked that everything cleans up into the dog's cage when you are done playing. Very fun!"
2,Cheap plastic and more pieces than necessary,"We bought this vet kit for our 3 year old son after reading the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I am not happy with the purchase.The small dog, which many reviewers noted as their only complaint, seems fine to me. My son puts other stuffed animals in the carrier so it isn't a big deal.The bigger problem for me is that the kit comes with 17 random vet tools, way more than necessary. He has only had the kit for one day and already I can't find half of the tools. Several are flimsy and the stethoscope won't even stay on my son's ears -it twists sideways when you try to put it on. For the price, I would have preferred about 5 or so well made vet tools instead of a huge pile of flimsy plastic."
3,Not what I expected,"My daughter really likes this but I expected something more substantial, I guess so I was disappointed. Didnt feel like it was worth the $$$."
4,Great buy,The plush toy is of a little poor quality but the tools included are very well manufactured. My child truly enjoys the crate and all items included.
5,Best toy we ever bought!,"We bought our Battat Vet Kit about 15 years ago, and it is still going strong. It is the most consistently played-with and enjoyable toy in our considerable collection. I've finally decided its success stems from the fact that kids like to be the doctor, but helping animals seems to give them more control over dealing with illness and injuries in a way that is less anxiety-producing than human-to-human doctor kits.Whatever the reason, it's a great toy, and I give it an A+++"
4,3-year-old finds career,My daughter suggested this for her daughter for Christmas. It was a good suggestion. My granddaughter was enthralled and she's more than happy to pretend you are a pet and check you out as well. I liked this particular option because it came with a dog/patient.
4,My 5 yo Loves It,"My five year old has an obsession with puppies -- and I thought he'd love to be a ""puppy doctor."" And this toy was everything it promised to be. He loves stuffing all his little puppies in the crate and carrying them around. And the tools are great for fixing up boo-boos. Lots of good imaginative play!"
3,missing Pieces,"I ordered this for my daughter who wanted a dog and food. When it arrived I quickly realized it was a 15 piece set, not 18 as advertised. It is missing the bone and food. So disappointed. Her Birthday is in 2 days."
5,Super fun animal vet carriet,My 3 year loved this for Christmas. He stuffs all of his tiny stuffed animals in it and carries it around. I put all of the instruments in a separate box for them to play pet doctor. Great purchase!
3,TINY,"How big would you think this would be?Imagine a reasonable size, and then cut it in half.Would not buy again."
3,kid vet kit,the vet kit cool but the stuffed dog is cheap. other wise my 3 year old is having a lot of fun with it. the shipping on this item was ridiculous.
5,Awesome--wish there were more toys like this,"I gave this to my son for Christmas and he loves it. It is so nice to have a toy that is not a car, truck or other typical toy. He is very much into imaginative play and this is right up that alley. I also love that everything can be stored in the little dog carrier. If I had a criticism, it's that the dog is a little small but other than that, a great toy and great concept."
1,Wrong set,"I too received a 15 piece set instead of the 18 piece set. I didn't notice it until I went to wrap it today for Xmas and looked at the picture. I specifically paid more for this set because it had the bone, dish and vitamins. These same types of sets can be bought in the store for at least $6 cheaper(15piece). I would give them a chance to just send me the missing parts but that's not an option, I have to return the whole thing and from other reviews it's doubtful I'd get the right set anyway. If I had more time I'd send it back I feel scammed seeing this has happened to others."
5,Perfect Gift,My niece loved this! She was so excited to fix her animals! Lots of pieces to play with! I am very happy with this purchase.
4,Good kit,"William not only used the kit on animals, he checked out the humans with his blood pressure and his stethoscope"
5,"Finally, Chinese music the way I want it :^)","I bought two other supposedly Chinese music CD's and on both, the music sounded only slightly Chinese. I wanted the type of music you hear in Chinese restaurants and I couldn't find it, until this CD. The music on this CD is completely obviously Chinese, and yes, it would sound good being played in a Chinese restaurant, and, not only that, but one of its songs; ""Silk Road"" doesn't just sound Chinese, it also sounds dreamy and Sci-Fi/Fantasy'ish.I absolutely recomend this CD to those looking for Chinese music. 5 stars!"
2,Average - both recording and content,I bought this based on a comment I read in an online forum. Did not find anything special.Cannot be classified as trash; but nothing extraordinary.
5,Simply the Best Live Recording,"As a drummer, I must say that this is the classic live recording ever for good ol' rock n'roll. Roger Earle's bass drum work on Slow Ride is legendary...single BD too! I heard Slow Ride on a Seinfeld episode when Elaine was waking up...great! I ran to my LP and got reacquainted with this classic. Listen to it as you drive to work...your going to have a great day!"
5,A tribute to Rod Price and Lonesome Dave,"I attended a blues festival at Fort Mason, SF California sometime around 04-05. Headliner was Buddy Guy with special guest Carlos Santana, supporting acts was British Blues allstars aka KIm Simmonds featuring Rod Price, and Norton Buffalo. Rod Price was hands down the monster among legends that beutiful day. This brought me back to ""Foghat Live"" A blistering live set wheras Rod Price's astonishing lead and slide guitar work has to be some of the finest chops ever recorded. I was heartbroken when i learned that Rod Price passed away about a year later and didnt know until today that Lonesome Dave had succumed to cancer. Foghat seemed to have a knack for commercial succses yet never selling out. This album when released back in the day was commercial in design yet when cued up turned into absolute rock n roll warfare...astonshing to this day...Rod and Dave...r.i.p."
2,All are re-records and several are pretty good.,"A box 3 CD cases and only 10 songs per(30 total). Not a good start then read: Contains new stereo records by the featured artists.I'm not against this stuff (re-records) but only if I know what I'm getting before I buy.That's not the case here. Some of the tracks are pretty good and bunches are completely forgettable. Some of the singers have voices that are completely changed, for others somebody else in the group sang here.Even at the reduced price, this isn't a keeper.Save your money..."
4,Something for everybody in this collection of rarities,"Rhino deserves a hand for reviving these rare sides. ""Hipsters' Holiday"" is an eclectic Christmas package; so individual selections will be a matter of taste. The slower, melancholy cuts will appeal to blues addicts, while other listeners will probably use the ""skip"" button and go right to the upbeat stuff. This writer's top three are Oscar McLollie's ""Dig That Crazy Santa Claus"" (an early doo-wop masterpiece that really jumps); Leo Watson's manic, fascinating scat singing on ""Jingle Bells,"" and Louis Armstrong's bravura vocal on the spooky ""Zat You, Santy Claus?"" Sure to generate some holiday cheer. Sound quality is excellent."
4,"Have a crazy cool Christmas, but don't get knocked out.","This is a collection of jazzy Christmas songs. But don't be scared, it's vocal jazz, which is more accessible than instrumental jazz (some of the tracks actually lean more towards R&B than jazz). There are a lot of cool songs here. But I have to question why Tim Fuller's ""Silent Night"" from 1989 is here, when the rest of the songs are from the 40s, 50s and 60s. It seems a bit out of place here (it's good, though). I also should mention that the sound quality is not that great on a few tracks, which sound like they were recorded from scratchy old 78s. Despite that, this is a fun collection which should inspire you to have a ""cool"" Christmas."
5,good jazz christmas tunes,"I like this cd as it has a lot of different styles to it. There are two scat tunes, Leo Watson's jingle Bells and Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross's Deck us all with Boston Charlie. Both a ot of fun. All three Louis Armstrong songs are a treat, especially Zat You, Santa Claus, where Louis thinks Santa is a prowler. There's Santa Done Got Hip is more of a pop tune. Blue X-mas is for people that think Christmas is way overdone.The only one that doesn't fit is Tim Fuller doing Silent Night. That track does not belong on any compilation. It's horrible. Lena Horne's Jingle all the way is a little too pop to be jazz. However, the rest is very enjoyable with many tunes you don't hear on the radio. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointed,This cable works as its suppose to as far as a USB cable but you purchase this for the lights and this cable doesnt light on both ends. Only on the A side. On the mini side it doesnt light up which was a BIG DISAPPOINMENT!! I stayed with them because it wasnt worth the trouble of the RMA but buyer beware. This is something they should mention.
5,Symphony #1 is the winner here.,"All of these pieces are worth a listen, but especially the Symphony #1 which has a particularly haunting slow movement with expert writing for winds. The 5th symphony is similar, perhaps too similar to justify recording both. It strikes me as a slightly watered down version of the 1st symphony, with less interesting themes and motives. As for the 7th Symphony, the second movement is a gentle reflective treatment of wordless children's and adult voices that is very effective. Unfortuately, in the outer movements, the same wordless choirs are used in a more harsh and strident way, destroying the effect. Still, worth acquiring for the 1st Symphony, one of Casadesus' most beautiful works."
5,one of the coolest toys there is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the toy is so cool I can't believe it is so durable that when I accidently sat on it I did not hear a single crack what I did hear was R2-D2 saying some things he said in Episode 1 and the things came crystal clear to my ears because the sound is exstordidary. I gave it 3 stars on educational value cause you learn but mostly just about star wars episode 1. In all it is a great toy and I would recomend it to all who loves star wars.
4,Fun & Facinating for my daughter,I bought this for my 5-year old daughter for Christmas and she really enjoys playing with all the magnets. There are some activity/experiment cards which we have been using. The cards help give unmderstanding about how and why magnets work. She is facinated by all the included magnets and can spend quite a bit of time playing while learning about cause & effect. I think this a great product!
3,Just okay!,I had high hopes for this. I teach pre school and wanted to introduce magnets. It had all the parts but what you could do with them is limited. For the price I think you could find something better.
4,"Works as expected, I like it","Although the bottle was a little greasy (I guess because it contains glycerol and somehow leaked outside), I sprayed twice into a microfiber car cloth and wiped a small test area of my leather seat to see what would happen. After 20 seconds of firm rubbing, the dirt was removed. I then proceeded to spray generously onto the cleaning cloth and rub down my leather bucket seat. It cleaned it pretty well, even removing some weird sticky stain that an auto mechanic had so generously left for me. It does not work instantaneously, but with firm circular strokes, the dirt will be removed.Although it does soak into the leather and leave a shiny look, the shine was gone the next day and my beautiful matte leather was restored to clean and new. Just don't overspray and saturate the leather--spray onto a cleaning cloth and rub down."
1,Useless,Soaks into the leather instantly. Probably OK on shiny waterproof leather but in that case one might as well use plastic cleaner.
2,Not a good cleaner,Point blank This is just way to mild. This stuff would not clean my leather. I went ahead and purchased Concorso Leather Cleanse and was very happy with it!
1,Seriously Disappointed,"After reading all the great reviews at Amazon, I called about SEVEN local stores in Mesa, AZ. It seemed like Nobody in the area sold it (other reviewers have mentioned this too).Now I know why. It does NOT work. Not any better than the significantly more inexpensive, Armor All (which also 'shines and protects' -- so no conditioner purchase is necessary).If I had bought it locally, I would have returned it for a full refund.I just bought a 2004 Nissan 350z, and the tan leather car seats are still pretty dirty looking. Even after two applications of Zymol, a total of two hours cleaning (mostly just on the driver's seat) and lots of 'elbow grease'."
2,No all that pleased!,"Not all that great, removed some marks, it did state that if the area went black stop using it, and yes it went black and looks worst now."
5,Cracker: Series 1,"Love the series, very dramatic, acting awesome. Robbie Coltrane is fantastic as ""Fitz"". Amazon prices are great and delivery fast. Purchased all three seasons!"
