1,"i can't beleve this! what happened to you, raven","1st of all, i am 13 and i have only heard some of this album and all i can say is, what happened to you raven? why are you dressing like this? and what's up with your music?if you want a good cd buy the new hilary duff cd. that is a really good cd"
2,Raven Symone.......,"I like Raven and all..But when she sings, not a A+ Singer to me. She stole like 2 songs! And I got all pissed! On Cheetah Girls, they stole Cinderella from Play! And now, in her new album, she stole What Is Love from Play! AGAIN! I'm a big big fan of Play and I don't respect Raven for doing that. I love her on t.v. on her That's So Raven show, but when it's singing, just forget about it! I mean get the cd if you want but, just saying, you should check out Play's original version of Cinderella and What is Love. They have better voices! Like when Raven sings their songs, she doesn't sing with a lot of power as Play does. Trust me. Sorry if this doesn't help, but I'm just giving you some advice, just please hear Play's original version. Buy this cd for all I care! Anyways, I know Raven is a good person and all, its just...(sigh)...."
2,WILL DISNEY EVER STOP?!?!?,"I'm pretty much sick of disney channel,they are trying to make there actress' into singers???First Hilary Duff [...], then they make a music video(Actually like 2 cuz there was like 1 on the Even Stevens Movie)for Christy Carlson Romano(or whatever her name is) then they made one for chelsea(dont know real name) on That's So Raven.WILL THEY EVER STOP MANUFACTURING ACTRESS'?!?!?!?!?!!?FOR GODS SAKE DO THEY LIKE TORTURING ME OR SOMETHING?I mean I gave it an extra star cuz backflip was OK, not good or fine, OK.disney is just trying to make us all blind to the truth, and [...] us in to the manufactured singers, for there own greed.Hopefully you found this reveiw helpful, and in the near future, you will be able to tell crap from good.(Evanescence is a G-R-E-A-T choice!!!!!)"
1,Please stop the madness............Please,Look I am all for people trying to explore talents that they MAY THINK THEY HAVE. But Raven is no singer and I wish everyone would let her know that. I Think she is okay as an actor and even that is pushing it. She sounds like a cat with its tail in the door. I am begging that Disney please inform these people that think they are singers( Hilary Duff and anyone else on the Disney channel) that they can't sing and need to stop. This album sucked and unless you are between the ages of four and ten then you might like otherwise don't waste your money or the 40 minutes of your life that you won't get back.
4,"""Usually not my cup of tea"" but I was shocked......sort of!(4.5 stars)","I didnt know Raven could sing as good as she does.I always thought she was just one of those fake wannabe's like JoJo or Hilary Duff or somebody,but she actually has talent.Time will only tell how Raven's voice progresses over the years,but as for now keep up the good work kid!"
4,Shocking,I was not expecting to hear anything on this cd that I would ever listen to again. Raven really shocked me. I remember previous projects that didnt do much for me. I knew she was a good actress...but I never actually thought much of her as a singer. This project is truley an eye opener. Good job!!
4,Excellent!!!,"I knew Raven could act but who knew she could sing to? My fave tracks on this album are Mystify,Backflip,What Is Love, and Bump. I think she did a great job on doing the remix of What Is Love that Play also did. So I just wanna say if you're a Raven Symone fan like me you won't be disappointed."
5,i love your cd!I love your c.d i bought it the first time it came out ra thats how famouse you are!:-),"I love your c.d i bought it the first time it came out ra thats how famouse you are!:-)Loveya,Nadine Martinez your best number1 fan!:-)"
3,Raven is tight!,"I dunno what miz ""Jazzy"" was sayin' up der, but she should get a life, and learn her facts. RAVEN was actually a singer since she was like, 5. She had an album when she was 10, okay. Just because you group her in w/ those other 'kidz bop' (keepin' da theme) rejects (e.g. Hilary Duff n Kristy Romano) doesn't mean a thing. She is a real artist with a unique style and she can also act wayy better than them too! So next time before you open yo stank breath mouth to rank on RAVEN, you should think cuz I MIGHT JUST GET UP IN YO UGLY FACE. OK? Thank you, and just keep listening to yo non-singing Avril Lavigne idol. (Just 2 let you know, she isn't all of dat.)"
1,"this sucks, don't buy it","She can't sing to save her life. This is just the pop trash of the week. You can hardly hear her voice (of lack thereof) behind all the synths and production gloss. This is a warm, stinking turd of an album. Do your kids a favor and buy them a Janis Joplin CD."
4,A lace shaper bra!,"The lace is a nice touch. If you turn it inside out you can see that, behind the lace, there is some sort of suport to keep the lace flat. Don't worry about it, you can not feel this or any other thing in this bra. It is completely smooth.I can tell you this is not a tight model, if you don't know which size you should get because you are between M-L you should probably get the M.It is very comfortable, and somehow supportive, but this is not for sports (jogging, jumping...).It gives a nice shape, I think it is good for little or bigger girls (you know what I mean).I am using it as a nursery bra, because it is comfortable, easy to feed my baby and it has a better shape than those ugly nursing bras that show. It is also not tight for me even when I haven't fed the baby, so it helps prevent mastitis.(for nursing moms, tight undergarments can cause mastitis)I will get another one!"
2,Why?? What happened??,"One of my favorite ""best of"" albums of all time. However, beware of this German made gold disc addition from 2003. One would think any German made compact disc, especially in recent years, would be of the highest quality, both in terms of the sound and packaging. But NOT with this release. Why and what happened? The packaging is minimal - no liner notes, no mastering information, no additional pages, only a track listing (similar to low budget early 80's releases). The sound quality is appalling - compressed and flat sounding (I listened to this with headphones) and was very disappionted after only a few tracks into the complilation. Certainly, not the way I remember this title. I for one will look for another edition."
2,Disappointed,"The quality of this CD is so bad I refuse to listen to it in spite of loving these songs. Some are fuzzy, some loud, some soft. Very poorly done and a waste of money."
2,Not sturdy - poor value,"I bought these for my girlfriend to use while walking the dogs and various chores. She had them a week, did not really use them much and some of the seams have started coming undone. The gloves still look like new, not even dirty and they are failing already - not what I'd expect from work gloves. I can't think of anything they'd be good for. Cotton jersey gloves would be a better value."
2,"not authentic,good quality beanie,terrible quality patch.",life long steelers fan.bought 2 of these one for me one for my son.the beanie is great but the patch sucks.very cheap looking and the steelers is barley ledge able.do yourself a favor and buy the authentic one.
4,A Well-Constructed Hat,"After going through 1 product delivery where only an empty box arrived, reordering the product (at no additional cost) and waiting an extra 5 days for delivery (I'm not sure why exactly, but a major snowstorm might have played a part in it), we finally received The Hat. My son is happy and likes it a lot! It looks sturdy and should last well, although our main reason for purchasing this hat is for identification with Pittsburgh and the Steelers (win or lose)! So it's serving its purpose."
1,- - - - - DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE TITLE - - - - -,"I love the films of Edgar G. Ulmer and had high hopes for this DVD. I was incredibly disappointed.If you are seeking deep insights into the man and his craft, look elsewhere. Beyond the facts that he was under-funded, rushed and did his very best with what he had (which is repeated ad nauseam by all involved) you will find little here - And, really, anyone familiar with his work already knows this only too well.The only saving grace for this DVD is the inclusion of a very watchable copy of ""Isle of Forgotten Sins"" - A.K.A. ""Monsoon"". Don't be discouraged by the badly damaged titles, the movie clears up for the story and has surprisingly good sound.Here's hoping that someone will eventually give Ulmer the detailed attention he so richly deserves."
2,NOTE: Not a music CD,"Review from England:Not Bad..., August 24, 2003Reviewer: stez_5 from Bristol, EnglandThis is definitly only a purchase for hard-core fans who want an insight on Alanis' rise to fame. However, I expected more interviews with Alanis but it does explain the artist's life concisely. It's certainly interesting for what it is but I don't think this is a necessary Alanis product. Please note that it contains no new music by her."
2,"fiskars 10"" spring action pinking shears",The scissors are awful no spring action I have to open them with my thumb after each cut!!! The just work properly would not purchase again. extremely disappointed.
4,Great pair of scissors.,"I don't sew. I apply fabric to aircraft surfaces and these pinking shears are needed to cut ceconite fabric. They work fine, are sharp and are easy to handle. I did notice the retaining clasp is difficult to understand, I lent them to another worker and instead of sliding the lock back to release the scissors he just unsnapped the lock and took it off. Well, the lock didn't break and I just slide it back on when he returned the scissors. So, I guess they are tough."
3,does the job,The product is alright. I found that it doesn't always cut nicely through material..you sort of have to manipulate these sheers while cutting to make sure it cuts through the fabric.
5,great find,being left handed ordinary pinking shears were very hard to use. i use this style regular shears was was so happy to find the pinking shears also in this style
3,Nice for one layer of fabric; not so great for more than one layer,"This works great for one layer of fabric - but does not work that well with 2 or more. The pair I purchased seem to be less sharp back towards the handle which quite frankly could just be a defect in my pair. The handles are easy to use - the spring action obviously makes it less fatiguing on your hands. I just wish I could find a pair of pinking scissors that worked on more than one layer, since I use them to cut the ends of new fabric before I wash it; it reduces the fraying that often happens in the wash/dryer."
3,Flimsy Acrylic Lens,"Beware! The acrylic lens that comes with this fixture is very brittle, and you need to handle it carefully. I accidentally broke a piece out of the lens literally within a few seconds of removing the fixture from its shipping carton. Fortunately, a friend of mine had some glue made specifically for acrylic plastic, and I was able to glue the lens so the break isn't noticeable. Now that the fixture is installed, I am happy with it."
1,Doesn't fit Suzuki/Geo/Chevy 1.6,"Oy- this is yet another Bosch rotor that cross references to late 90's Suzuki Sidekick/ X-90 1.6 motors, Geo/Chevy Metros. It doesn't fit, and I had to send it back."
4,Almost Amazing,"This first album contains some great blues, songs and guitar from Bill Perry. I was amazed on stumbling across this cd a few years back. Perry has not had any coverage where I live and this cd was not listed on Amazon until reasonably recently. The album is a bit uneven but still highlights his potiental. His guitar is often awesome and his smokey vocals more than adequate. Check out 'down' as a master piece of atmosphere and guitar, the strangely named 'settle down, fred' for his guitar ability and feeling, and 'fade to blue' (both versions) as examples of some funky blues. Some tracks however do not measure up because of ultra high note playing that tends toward partial hysteria."
1,why,"i have no idea why i bought this. i have never used it. it was a waste of money. if you are not certain, just get the latest version of photoshop instead."
5,A Socially Redeeming Film!!! Very Inspirational!!!!,"The late,great Lucille Ball Shines in her portrayal of a homeless baglady who is unknowingly befriended by a social worker trying to reach her.Hopefully,Koch Vision Entertainment will release more socially concientous and redeeming DVD's such as their recently released ""Nobody's Child"" starring Marlo Thomas ,a true story based on the book of a mental patient,Marie Balter, wrongly institutionialized for over 20 years but overcomes all obstacles to become successful.We need more inspirational films like these instead of some of the garbage that Hollywood puts out nowaday's!!!"
5,movie,good movie. if only all the homeless had a happy ending . but real life isnt so kinda. still very good movie..
5,Stone Pillow,This is for the true Lucy fan. She shows just how far her acting ability goes. She doesn't have to be funny to be fun to watch.
2,"Dog will eat it, but poop like crazy!","Ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual. He is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food. Now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad, like the poster above, its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in"
3,Has it's moments,"Prayer Beads is one of the better Japanese horror anthology tv series to come out in a while. Though it starts off slow and has many episodes not worth watching, there are some truly scary and original tales here. Definitely worth a look from the J-Horror fan."
5,powerful tool,unfortunately it was confiscated at the airport.I liked it a lot. I put it together with my keys.
3,So so,"Don't like the shell color, it's too dark and not smooth.Maybe type I will be better than type II."
5,Excellent shop hammer,"Thia was a gift from my wish list. Didn't really need it, but love it. Park tools are usually top quality, and this hammer is no exception."
3,Average but ok,"I liked one main song, but the thing i didn't like was the fact that theres about 5 songs and the track listed as having 13 songs. Its just a repeat of the same songs. Its kind of disappointing... But the sound is great. I just wish there were more mantras on the sound track..."
1,"HORRIBLE! Hip Hoppy, Jazz Improv style to chants sucks!","The real reason I bought this was because I'm a big Steven Halpern fan and all of his stuff is great; who knew this Lama Surya Das (Long Island boy) would mess this CD up. I never return cds but this was so lousy I am most definitely returning it. A waste of my time, listening and most importantly ENERGY."
2,Disappointing,"I found this CD to be very disappointing in that the chanting lacks heart and the music doesn't blend well with the chanting. There are times when the chanting is way off key and others when the music seems to falter. The selections to listen to at Amazon are the best of the CD, from there it goes downhill and close to the end of the CD I was tired of listening to it. It's almost boring. I think Halpren...can do so much better. Save your money or buy Chakra Chants instead. That one is truly excellent!"
3,Not at all what I expected...,"Lama Surya Das writes wonderful books. This is not the case though with this album. I have a problem with Hip Hop beats while meditating!!! This was not at all what I had hoped for or wanted. Take away the drum machine, please!"
5,ALL YEAR LONG,"THE BOOK WAS BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED, AND TOOK THE READER THROUGHTHE DAYS OF THE WEEK AND ALSO THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR.THE BOOK ISLOVELY WITH A WONDERFULLY GENTLE FEELING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN."
4,New Jersey Does It Again,"Pacewon steps up front with extensive solo effort. More for your money is more suitable. In the tradition of previous Outsidaz releases (i.e. The Bricks and Nightlife EP), Pacewon accents, emphasize, and execute wordplay lovely. His imagination is worthy of classic noteriety boasting lines such as ""I don't be battling average men, I rip your establishment"". The beats remain fresh and complimentary to his lyrics. Features guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Korupt, Rah Digga, Young Zee, and of corse the Outsidaz. Also contains the hit video ""I Declare War"" on second disc. Pacewon is definetly worthy of investment."
5,Wonderful family movie!,"This is a wonderful movie to share with your family. A group of teenagers take matters into their own hands when the military decides to give up on their captured fathers. Set in Korea, the children are the sons and daughter of Navy SEALs who were captured by North Korea in international waters. When the teens overhear top military officals giving up on the captured man, they set off on their own rescue, using the plans and connections established by the military before the plan was abandoned."
4,the rescue,"This item was what I had been searching for. I know it's an old movie, but it was one in my memory where kids were proud of their fathers and didn't want to lose them.The Rescue [VHS]"
5,Dead Honest!,This is a funny yet truthful slap to our American faces. If you don't like the truth then don't get this DVD. This is a dark yet truly funny stand-up. The reviewers who don't like this or think Carlin has lost it are probably the one's he talking about. Stop being little girls and accept it!
2,Very dissapointing,"I've always been a big fan of george carlin, so when I heard that he was gonna do a new stand up I got on the horn right away. Little did I know that I was going to be very dissapointed. This one is really not that funny at all. I mean I've always loved george for his topics on things that piss him off, but this was just really depressing. It seemed like just a big speech and not a comedy act. He talks a lot about suicide and other very depressing stuff that just made me wanna commit suicide. I watched about half of it before I had to turn it off. It was just way too depressing. There were a couple of jokes here and there, but not a whole lot."
3,He was amazing.,"Some of this is very funny, some of it is definitely very unfunny (I didn't go for the humor about suicide - it justwasn't funny to me - not for any personal reasons, though - it just went on too long and was tiresome, I'd say. ) - but I'mglad I bought this DVD, and was once again able to see this brilliant comedian in action."
1,pretty f'n laim,goes on and on about negative jive. not funny in the least. one dimensional. sobriety and carlin don't mix. don't go here lookin for a laugh or something you don't already know about the ugly side of america.
5,"SERIOUSLY ,HIS FINEST HOUR !","MAYBE BECAUSE SOME THINGS ARE NOT LAUGHING MATTERS ,ANYMORE,SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THIS SHOW.HE TENDS NOT TO BE AS GOOFY AS USUAL BUT A MORE SERIOUS COMEDIAN. A MUCH MORE PERCEPTIVE COMICAL PERFORMANCE HAS HE GIVEN US.TO ME HIS BEST EVER . DON'T GET ME WRONG , HE'S STILL FUNNY ,VERY FUNNY, BUT WITH A MUCH SHARPER BITE . HE'S PISSED OFF AND LET'S US KNOW ABOUT IT . HE SEEMS TO BE 'THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE';OF PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY & ARE JUST AS P/Off AS HE IS!IF THEY EVER CENSURE SUCH SHOWS ,OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES WOULD DROP TO THAT OF A FACIST STATE. I THANK GOD FOR GEORGE CARLIN , MAY HE LIVE FOREVER .A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE."
1,A Hippy Who never grew up.,"I suppose if your a big Timothy Leary fan he may float your boat. His countless attack on religon and America is like a broken record. And Im not even religous.What do you expect from today's comediens anyway, when almost all the material is written by sombody else. Half of Hollywood coundnt make in the real world and Im sure has 2 different mansions in Beverely Hills with 20 cars from a country he probably wouldnt even die for. Hollywood your boring real people too death."
4,Good but...,"The album is very good. Lots of varying styles and good honest acoustic guitar playing. But, with Howe and Martin on the same album, it should have been better. There's nothing really special to make the album reach new heights. If you're a fan of either guitarist, then I'd say it's money well spent."
1,guitar snooze-fest,"Allegedly, these 2 virtuoso guitarists were awed by one of the best guitar collections in all the world. This inspired them to... make a whole CD of hokey, trite, done-a-million-times-before . . . stuff. Where is the inspiration? The creativity? This CD adds nothing, nothing I say, to the musical vernacular. Disappointing to the point of oblivion."
5,Vampies as mercenaries,"Taking advantage of the unique powers and abilities of vampires, over the centuries an elite corps of vampires have operated as assassins. Now, at the start of the twenty-first century, vampires are too expensive and too much trouble for governments to hire them anymore.This is the premise in a truly fresh tale about vampires. The story spans a time period over eight hundred years, but the climax of the story takes place in New Mexico. Here, the government has changed its tactics and now wants super soldiers made from technology, rather than vampires, to do its dirty deeds. What is a vampire to do?"
4,History-spanning vampiric order!,"David's novel Vampires of the Scarlet Order truly explores the consequences of a group of true vampires on the history of the world. David's well-researched glimpses of historical times, organizations and personalities and their interaction with a well-developed order of vampires really answers the question 'what if?' effectively. Most writers of vampire stories mention the immortality of their vampires, but only write about a small slice of that time in a given story. David actually shows the evolution of their relationship with the mortal world over history -- in one novel! A definite 'must read' for all vampire (and history) fans."
3,Surprisingly quick delivery! Herb didn't do much though...,"I tried the herb for 1 month taking three a day all at once. I tend to be a stressful and anxious person and these herbal pills didn't really do anything. I did find that once I stopped taking it I did feel sliggtly more tensed but it may have been from the lack of sleep. I switched it up with HTP5 instead and noticed that it helped better instead. The brand of HTP5 I used is NOW. Perhaps a different brand would do better, maybe I took it at the wrong time of day, didn't take enough or did/did not take with food? I took it as recommended on the back. I ordered this last Friday and received it 2 days later on Monday!That really surprised me! I was expecting older orders but got this quicker than those ones."
5,Could this be my favorite cd EVER?,"The talent here is astounding. Just astounding. Lyrics to break your heart. Catchy to the nth degree. This is big, BIG music. Sounds like? Wow - every song is so different. I hear Queen, Whiskeytown, Lennon, Westerberg, Replacements, maybe a little G-n-R (uh-huh - that's right), Jakob Dylan (I've heard Bob in the Damnwells too, but not so much on this cd), Fleetwood Mac, Gin Blossoms, Goo Goo Dolls, Del Amitri & more. Start with ""Golden Days"", the single. It's infectious, well-written love. It moves you. Favorite lyric at the moment is from ""Shiny Bruise"", which is a startlingly sincere song: ""For every time I doubted you, I give myself a shiny bruise."" Wow. Where does that come from? Just amazing. The masses will be talking about these guys in a heartbeat. Hopefully, this is the future of music. I'm in."
3,Good background music.,"I listen to this CD a lot when I paint or do work around the house. The soundscapes are really genuine, and it has a really nice atmosphere and texture. The lyrics are like heartfelt poetry set to music. A really good listen, but not anything to write home about. I can't say I'd want to see these guys live, though I'd definitely buy another album of theirs."
2,Nowhere near Bastards of the Beat,"I first heard Bastards of the Beat, and I immediately fell in love with the Damnwells. Every song on that CD was better than the one before it. It is only natural to expect good music from their follow up. I have listened to it twice through, and will probably never listen to it again. Just listen to the free streams from their MySpace and save your money. In my opinion it was complete trash, and although I still respect them for Bastards of the Beat, Air Stereo knocked them down."
4,my husband only wears these pants,"My husband has fluctuating weight throughout the year. These pants offer a hidden elastic band that allows for the fluctuations. He wears them daily to work and will not wear any other casual work pant.They can be a bit pricey, I watch for good sales!!"
2,Wash before hemming - otherwise great,The color and styling are great. Unfortunately I had them hemmed before the first washing so they're shorter now than I would like but I still wear them.
4,Voodoo Child by Rogue Traders,"This is the type of song that you can not help moving to! It gets in your brain and at unexplained times you find youself singing lyrics like ""you are my voodoo child..."". We happened to have seen the video in Australia and it was awesome as well. It is a shame Rogue Traders have not made a splash here in the States."
1,Nothing good about this thing!,"I thought I was getting a good deal on this unit. A colored depth finder and WAAS GPS for less than $500. Boy was I wrong. The depth finder is impossible to adjust as to make anything out. Even with the boat not moving, the screen is filled with noise or false returns. The only way I can use the unit is to turn on the fish-symbols. That clears up the screen, but I am leary about its accuracy. As for the GPS, the base maps are useless. Plan to spend a couple hundred more on detailed maps. On my original unit I was unable to edit or manually create waypoints. The unit would only flash the edit screen, and not stay so I could make entries. I had it replaced by Eagle (took 40 days for responses to my emails and to send a replacement unit) and the new unit does the same thing. I sure wish I would have bought a Megallen handheld and a stand-alone fish finder. I would have spent the same amount and could have used the GPS other than on my boat."
1,no warranty,"Unit less than two years old,had problems with on/off button. unit would not come on half time, call lowrance out service,they don't repair.`send unit in and would replace with another for about $400.00. took 19 calls to even get to talk to someone."
3,OKAY,"This cd is OKAY. I'm somewhere in her target market, being an 18 year old female, maybe I'm a little old, but I listen to a wide range of music, including my fair share of pop. This CD is alright, I don't have her first, so I can't compare, but the lyrics are...so-so. They have good ideas behind them, and they touch on things a little deeper than her last CD as I'm lead to believe, yet...they're just not great, and the rhymes are kind of silly and obvious. Her voice is cute, a little whiney at times, but she's gotten better and seems to have a pretty decent range. Again, some songs are slightly silly, and even just vague-- but they're catchy. I think better writing would help Hilary out here a lot, but if you like Hilary, it's a pretty okay cd."
4,Pretty Good,"I have to admit (even though I am not a big fan) this is a good album. It's better than her last one. There are way better songs on this album than ""Metamorphosis"". My favorite songs are:- Fly- Weird- Hide Away- Who's That Girl- The Getaway- Haters- Someone's Watching Over Me"
1,This girl cannot sing,I don't understand why people can put down someone like Raven-Symone and then go on to say that someone like Hilary Duff has a good voice. Obviously nobody has ears. Maybe it's because of Hilary's nasaly screetching voice that cuts off the ablility for people to hear. She has nothing to her voice...no special talent to it or anything. It just comes out as a series of ugly flat notes. At least Raven has a voice worth listening to...it comes closer to Alicia Keys's voice then Hilary's does...
2,better than her first but....,"ok, i have never been a fan of hilary's, but i have heard her songs on the radio. and basically, her songs are all pretty corny and i thought: who would want to buy her CD? I didn't know she could sing this ""good"" until my sister burned it from a friend and blasted it on her CD player everyday. i learned to like a few of her songs:whos that girlwierdhaters?rock this worldone thing: that CD cover looks cheap and a total imitation of britney spears, which does not compliment you in anyway."
3,"as good as the first album, but good in a different way","On Hilary's new self titled album, she does get a bit more edgy music backing up her vocals,...but I wouldn't say her vocals are more impressive than they were on the Metamorphasis album.... The difference between her previous album and this one is that you can indeed hear her voice more than you can hear the backup singers.A lot of the songs have sort of an 80s-hair-band type of vibe to them - especualy on tracks like Mr. James Dean, and Cry... while Shine starts off sounding Beatle-esque.All in all it's a good album for what it is. I'm more impressed with the grownth of the lyrics, rather than the singing.... but it's all good."
5,Wow...,"Alright, I bought Hilary Duff's new cd because as of late I've been on this music loving streak and everything is a potential buy. Still loving pop music at heart, and having liked some of her earlier singles (although I didn't buy Metamorphosis), I thought I'd give it a try. I'm totally blown away right now. It's definitely more rock than anything else, and the songs are just amazing. I really can't say anything bad about the songs. I've been listening to the cd in its entirety, not just picking out songs. If Hilary Duff continues to put out this kind of quality music, she'll be around for a long time."
5,WOW!,"Wow! Hilary Duff's album is very different from her first album. In METAMORPHOSIS, her songs were more pop than rock. This album, however, is more pop-rock! It took some time adjustiong to her new voice and music, and her new way of singing. Her voice seems a lot more mature now, and her songs are also more mature. I love her new songs! I'm listening to the cd right now, and my body is moving in time to the rhythm. The songs are very catchy, you will feel like you just have to dance to the music and sing along. Overall, this album in a way is better than her first album! Great job to Hilary!"
1,The Girl Can't Rock,"I hate her voice!!!!!!!!!! She thinks she can rock like some good singers but she can't. I don't know why people like this loser, SHE SUCKS!!!!!!!! she's fat, ugly, and can't sing good songs. The songs in her cds are good but hearing her voice can make you SCREAM! She's a trash. Avril Lavigne is so better than Hilary Duff!!!!!!!!! She should get on a diet and take voice lesson!!!!!!! SHE'S A GOODY GOODY MOMMY'S GIRL!!!!!!! I'm sorry but I don't really like Hilary's voice. SHE SUUUUUUUUUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Bubble Gum Pop,"My sister has her cd and doesn't listen to it anymore, because Hillary sings bubble gum pop! The girl doesn't even know who she is! She thinks she's singing rock! PLEASE! If you want to hear rock listen to Limp Bizket, Linkin Park, or Nickleback! She is far from rock, and so immature! She keeps instigating a fight between her and Lindsay Lohan! So Aaron dated her! Big deal! Get over it! And if I were Hillary (which I'm thankful I'm not) I wouldn't blame Lindsay, I'd blame Aaron! It takes two to cheat! Hillary my advise to you........ Stop trying to be something you're not, work on your voice because it's not the greatest thing like you think it is, and GROW UP! Being immature and thinking you're cool by trying to start things with Lindsay, grows old fast! Good luck in the future, and finding your TRUE self!"
1,To the hills!,"Hilary Duff- my heart goes out to you. Why? It does seem odd really, since i ahve detested you for many years. However, my heart goes out to you that you tried to seem cool and that you tried to be a good artist. Why don't you just give it up? This cd, i've got to give it props because it does sound better than the last one, but she cannot sing. her voice is digital and you can tell. This is a horrible almbum, and on the trakc 'Mr.James Dean'- you wonder, does she even know who james dean is? please, save your money."
1,AWFUL TERRIBLE AND HORRIBLE!!!!,"Hillary Duff stinks, she is a horrible girl. I hope that she just ugggghhh stops singing or something wow is she bad! I can't even believe she has a record deal her voice is so digitalized and I never liked her as an actress either."
1,who is REALLY reviewing her album?,"Come on disney music execs, I know it's you giving her 5 star reviews!"
2,"I wish she would ""Hide Away""","If she would hide away, my life would be at peace!She sings like a 3 year old,and she's trying to be a *real* rocker when she probablycouldn't sing the ABC's. The only song's of her's that I like are: ""Fly"" and ""Why Not"". That's why I give two stars, one for ""Why Not"" and one for ""Fly"". Other than that,I wouldn't be writing this review.Why? They don't give 0 stars."
1,it's good......NOT,hilary can't sing or act. the only reason she even sold any cds is because she already had fans from the lizze mcguire show. and these fans are basically ten year olds who will belive anything is acting or singing. also all the music on the cd is the same thing over and over again. even lindsay lohan sings better than her and she makes my brother sound good. But lohan can act unlke hilary.and hilary can't model either because shes ugly and when she went down thisle on some fashion show with her sister at the end of the isle she turned around and looked at her sister. u don't look at your sister u look at the crowd of course no one wanted to see her face so of course her looking at her sister might be a good thing
1,"Hilary,just a stupid girl-by Joel(not the real Joel Madden)",WonderfulSuperExcellentGreatFabolousAwsomeBest---I am a liar---
5,A MASTERPIECE!!! GO HILARY!!!,"this is the best that i've heard from Hilary yet!! It's really great!! I've rated the songs on this CD, out of five stars. 5 being the best and 1 being the worst.FLY - 5/5DO YOU WANT ME? - 4/5WEIRD - 3/5MR. JAMES DEAN - 3/5UNDERNEATH THIS SMILE - 4/5DANGEROUS TO KNOW - 4/5WHO'S THAT GIRL - 5/5SHINE - 5/5I AM - 5/5THE GETAWAY - 2/5CRY - 5/5HATERS - 5/5ROCK THIS WORLD - 5/5SOMEONE'S WATCHING OVER ME - 5/5JERICHO - 2/5THE LAST SONG - 4/5So as u can see, the mojority of these songs are great, in my opinion. If your a Hilary fan, I would buy this CD!!_________________________________________|_______________GO HILARY_________________|"
3,Okay music,"Hilary doesn't really have an outstanding voice, it's pleasant, but I wouldn't call it any more than that. This CD is nice to listen to if you're in the mood. The songs are catchy. My daughter, who is 7, loves it. I would say this CD is fun for the pre-teen crowd, and it won't drive the parents crazy."
2,Slight improvement,"Hilary Duff's self-titled CD has slightly more mature (though not very enlightening) lyrics than on Metamorphosis, but she still does not sound convincing as a rocker. Some of the slower songs like the Avril-esque on the chorus ""Who's That Girl,"" ""Fly,"" ""Hideaway,"" ""The Getaway,"" ""Someone's Watching Over Me,"" and ""Jericho"" are palatable. But Lindsay Lohan is the way to go for pure pop-rock."
1,Vocal training and writing lessons.,"I was VERY disapointed with this album. I really think Hillary needs vocal training, and I'm NOT trying to be rude, but she does a lot of screaming and whining. Also, her lyrics are still young-sounding, and I know that many a young girl look up to her, but she needs to start thinking about what SHE wants."
3,Teen Music,Its not my kind of music but its ok for the kids. My neice loves it and at least you dont have to worry about Hillary acting like Brittany. At least I hope not.
1,This sucks,"This sucks. This sucks so much this cd makes simple plan look good! For good music listen to Sepultura, Lacuna Coil, Slayer, Megadeth, Metallica (even the new albums are better than this crap!), Testament, Exhorder, ZAO, Nile, Extol, Cryptopsy, Opeth, Hatebreed, DBX, GWAR, Anthrax, Lamb of God, Soulfly, Children of Bodon, Cannibal Corpse, etc."
4,Not So Yesterday Huh?,Fly - 9/10Do You Want Me? - 7/10Weird - 9/10Hide Away - 10/10Mr. James Dean - 8/10Underneath THis Smile - 9/10Dangerous To Know - 5/10Who's That Girl? - 10/10Shine - 9/10I Am - 10/10The Getaway - 7/10Cry - 7/10Haters - 10/10Rock This World - 9/10Someone's Watching Over Me -10/10- BEST SongJericho - 8/10The Last Song - 9/10
5,Excellent:),"First, just so you know, I am 15 but I don't feel like getting an account to review stuff.Metamorphosis was a nice album, but Hilary's second is so much better. Though Hilary works hard on this album (17 songs!), it leaves you wanting more songs & excited about any possibility of a 3rd album. My favourites are Mr. James Dean & The Getaway."
2,Metamorphasis was better,"I love Hilary Duff and I think she is very talented. But I'd have to say that her new self-titled album just isn't very good. In fact, I think that her first one, Metamorphasis, was a ton better. I can only maybe think of one or two songs that I think are pretty good on her new album. I think Hilary could have done better on this one."
5,Love this CD!!!,"This Cd really rocks! here is how i rate the songs,and how much i listen to them:Fly 9/10Do you want me? 10/10Wierd 9/10Hide away 8/10Mr. james dean 9/10underneath this smile 8/10dangerous to know 9/10who's that girl? 9/10Shine 10/10I am 10/10The getaway 10/10Cry 7/10Haters 10/10rock this world 10/10Someone's watching over me 10/10jericho 8/10the last song 10/10Hilary Duff Is really talented!,you should buy this CD ..it rocks!!!..if you have any questions,then please e-mail me at: lil_angel_1454@yahoo.com or jojofanfanatic@hotmail.com..thanks!"
1,This is awful.,"I have never been a fan of Hilary Duff... I never thought she was a good actress... but I did buy and enjoy her first CD, Metamorphosis. This new self titled CD is HORRIBLE. All of the songs sound exactly the same to me (same insignificant blurred beat and same whiny vocals), and not a good sort of same. This CD is not in any way more mature or better than her first. And for people who say this has a hard rock feel... ARE YOU INSANE? This CD is nowhere near rock, more like bubblegum trash pop. I feel like this entire CD was rushed... a quick effort to add more money to her bank account. If you want to buy a CD from Hilary Duff, definitely buy Metamorphosis, but stear clear of this garbage."
2,Cut about half the album and it would have been much better,"17 tracks appear on Hilary Duff's second album. A lot of growth is shown in the selection of songs, but Duff's vocals still leave a lot to be desired. There are some surprisingly good songs here though: ""Fly"", ""Someone's Watching Over Me"", ""Workin It Out"" and ""Jericho"" are all a cut above average teen pop, but there's a lot of stinkers on here though.Most of the songs feature the positive message of being yourself and not caring what others think. And I guess that's better than what most of these teen pop princesses are saying. Axe a few of those horrible songs, and this disc would have gotten 3 stars."
1,Hilary Duff Sucks!!!!,"I hate Hilary Duff. Why does a lot of music suck these days. Hilary thinks she's all that and you know what? SHE'S NOT ANYTHING AT ALL!She shouldn't have any cds or dvds out.Let's see what she has shall we. Shes has NO talent, She doesn't have a good voice, she can't play an instrument, and she just plan sucks!You people who listen to Hilary Duff should be listening to bands like Good Charlotte, Simple plan, Green Day, New Found Glory, Rancid, H2O, Goldfinger, Agnostic Front, and Mest. These bands rock! Hilary SUCKS!!!Don't listen to it just because everyone else likes it either. Have your own opinion for God's sake. HILARY DUFF HAS ABSOLUTELY NO TALENT!!!!!"
1,Damn not even close to 1 star,Her music is beyond bad. Her b/f band isn't much better. She can't sing and or act. Why even spend money to buy anything of hers? Her voice is in no way unique or different! Just b/c you wear a studded belt and or braclet DOES NOT MAKE YOU PUNK!!! Neither does thick black eyeliner or a wanna be punk emo b/f! She may claim to be punk and have good music and a great acting career but I know that Sid Vicious is rolling over in his grave over this. Gary Oldman good give her a thing or to in acting!
2,whats up with hilary,"whats up with hilary? she cant just go from lizzie mcguire to teen pop rebel. after having a kiddie reputation from lizzie mcguire she decided to go ahead with why not and her metamorphosis cd. big mistake. if she wantes to be teen punk, she cant do lizzie mcguire or metamorphosis. now shes wearing all black and shes a fake. now shes realized her mistake and shes just trying to fix it by making it worse. i was really surprised with fly. its a great song like someones watching over me. but its not that great of a cd. if u want teen punk try skye sweetnam. she knows how to make her reputation come out with a bang!"
4,"Out of the ""Metamorphosis"" era","Hilary's second effort is quite good. She blends pop with a little bit of rock. The only problem I have with this CD is the songwriting. She repeats the chorus a lot (like 6 times in lots of songs) in all her songs almost except ""The Last Song"". Hilary needs to do more songwriting, she will get more fans if she does, probably. I hate how there is always a song like ""The Last Song"" on each Hilary CD.Songs to listen to (my favorites): ""Someone's Watching Over Me"", ""Cry"", ""Underneath This Smile"", and ""Jericho"".I like all the songs, but basically, Hilary could do better. This is a great CD for Hilary fans. She does better in acting though, and she sure out of the ""Metamorphosis"" era. I give this CD 4 stars because truely, and honestly, Hilary needs some new songwriters and lyrics."
3,HILARY WANTS TO FLY.,"Miss Duff sophomore album shows some grow musically and vocally, but the similarity between more than 14 songs is way to much. Maybe that's the main reason the second single has not surface into the music scene. ""Fly"" the leading single is a rock tune targeted for young ladies to feel FREE. The lyrics and even Duff's interpretation are acceptable. But the thing is, that you can make a great album without making it so extensive, and next time, maybe Hilary is given more liberty to choose more different styles or rhythm so she can jump out of her Disney persona and become a mainstream performer. Because we all know that little girls grow, and Hilary has to grow to a more mature audience. ***THREE STARS even though her songs sound average and similar, you can tell that Miss Duff eagers for autenticity and wants to be heard."
2,overall bad,"While some of the songs on Hilary's self titled album are fun and tolerable, overall I found them horrible. The pitch is bad and the background music is annoying in most of the songs. They all sound the same and in some of them it sounds like she's either talking or screaming. The CD doesn't show her talent at all. I think she sounds horrible on the CD actually. I do not recommend buying this, it's a waste of money. Copy it from a friend."
4,kind of a let down after Metamorphosis,"It was worth buying, but I liked the first one better. I was expecting something a little different. Some of the songs are a little weird. I would actually give it 4.5 stars."
5,I would give it a million stars if i could!!,This is an AWESOME cd!!! I listen to it every day!! I give each song 10/10!!!
3,More or less...,"HIlary Duff's album isn't so good, and I really bought it because of ""Fly"", because I love it!, but it really has songs that shouldn't have ever been included, like ""Do You Want Me?""...The worst song ever!!!But it has a few good songs, I really like ""The Getaway"", ""Underneath This Smile"", ""Shine"", and ""Who's That Girl?"" These are good songs, and if this album was rated with 3.5stars, I don't want to imagine the first album ""Metamorphosis"" rated with 2stars!It has too much songs, 17! It's an excess, and in the CD says ""Place this CD in your computer's CD-Rom drive to access special features"": Lie! When I heard it and I thought it was OK, I thought that it was going to include the music video for ""Fly"", and whan I put it in the computer...ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! I really didn't like how she tried to ""rock"" with that little-girl voice she has, and I think it wasn't a bad CD, but it wasn't good, either"
3,Good,"It was great c.d.Hilary isn't a great singer like Kelly Clarson,but she is still good.She is a great role model.[...]!No one can do everything!"
2,A Talentless Act Can Still Make Catchy Music,"Hilary Duff is sweet and fun, we all know that. But her talent is about as outstanding as Lindsay Lohan is honest about her [...] job. Anyways, Duff again creates an album of insanely catchy tunes while never really proving herself as a singer. Her voice has barely any range, but it is still impressive how much they can do with editing these days. Anyways if you're a poop, i mean pop fanatic go pick it up. If you don't like singers who shouldn't really be singing, stay away."
1,The Girl CAN'T Rock!,"I'm no Kelly Clarkson, but I could get a record deal if Hilary can! She doesn't sing, she whines! How can someone in the right mind think this is music!"
1,go back to acting,"music was not made for hilary duff and it shows in all her songs that she does not sing great at all and I don't understand why she looks like a wrinkly 40 year old already when she's not even in her 20's yet, it's sad how disney exploits this girl and tells her she can sing when she really can't. She should have just gone to college after lizzie mcguire"
1,Time to lose some IQ points!,"Anybody been wondering why they have lost the ability to do math? I have found the answer. Thi CD will not only cause you to dumber, it will also give you the overwhelming urge to kill someone. I don't really know why you would pay your hard urned cash just to get dumber, but apparently there a lot of people who do. This girl is the worst thing that has happened to music since Brtney Spears. Her voice suounds more like a dying allegator than a human being. Hilary Duff is the kind of person that could make you lose complete faith in humanity. She doesn't write the music (which could be viewed as a plus because the music is so damn bad) but I suppose that's okay, because It doesn't really matter who writes it if it's terrible. There is one thing this CD can do for you. If you've got a test at school and know you're going to flunk it, listen to this in the morning, and soon you will be vomiting all over the place. I hope you enjoy puking. Have a nice day!"
1,It Sucks!,Even worse than metamorphosis. That's why she has only released one single off this album('fly') because the rest of the album sucks. Please Don't Buy it!
1,OH PLEASE,"Hailary Duff I am tried of seeing her everyone shes annoying. She cant sing worth a note. She cant act worth a thing. Shes a fake. Shes not even close to pretty theres a word called MAKEUP. She wears to much of it and one day shes all pretty and preppy the next day shes all rock and punk. Its stupid. She cant make anything good, her clothing, makeup and whatever else she may of made is stupid, ""Stuff more like Stupid""...Her disney show is so stupid and proves nothing to kids. But shes a little stupid s***, and who the hell would date Joel Madden from GC?...I am sorry but thats way to overboard. Shes such a goody goody, and fighitng with Avril only proved that Avril cant fight and Hailary is just plain stupid. Shes a fake little hollywood s*** to make kids be like her one of these days. It makes me sick."
2,Nobody said that bubblegum pop was bad,"Why did Hilary stop singing, bubblegum pop? Her first album sounded way better than this peice of crap. Who in the he** is Mr. James Dean? This album was seventeen songs of awfulness, and the girl really can't sing. I can tell that some parts are sung for her, just listen real closely to ""Hide Away,"" and "" The Getaway,"" you'll see what I mean. I don't know, why I even bought this Cd. But, you know if you like music that doesn't make sense at all, buy this album, but if you don't, you'd better save your $15.00!"
1,Hilary Duff is talentless.,"We know she is a girl who got a record deal based on her already-present fame, rather than vocal talent.Her voice is horrible, despite the digital altering.And, on top of that, Hilary doesn't even write her own songs (which is a scary thought anyway). Her singing is pretty much monotone; she has a pathetic voice range.Let's just say that she wouldn't stand a chance on American Idol.As for films, she can NOT act. She's nominated for a 2005 razzie award for her contributions (can I even call it that?) to ""A Cinderella Story"" and ""Raise Your Voice"".I feel so sorry for all the little kids who have had to listen to her songs about rain and crap like that, flying away, etc. Hilary Duff is one of the fakest celebrities ever. The only reason little girls like her is because it's TRENDY to like her. Hilary Duff should come clean and fly away![...]"

4,Hidden Treasures :-p,"I really dont know why people are so anti-hilary, I was too until I heard this CD. Like the other reviewer sadi, people dont give her props. Metamorphasis and Hilary Duff are really good albums and are included on my favourite CDS of all time! This self-titled has many gems hidden inside but also has a bit of waffle. The best tracks that stand out in my mind are Fly, Weird, Hide Away, Dangerous to Know, Underneath This Smile and The Getaway. The worst tracks are Cry, and The Last Song. I cant even listen to The Last Song it is much too painful. I dont even gat the point of it; Hil is only talking to a beat for 0:55 seconds! Oh well...buy this CD, the hidden gems are worth the $9.99!:-) Laura :-)"
3,"O.K,","I guess I could say, ""O.K""I mean I like some of the songs, but most of them are when hilary's yelling words, she's just a little wierd looking. And in recent pics shes hardly skin, & mostly bones.She says thing in ""Dangerous to Know"" that arn't great. I don't recemend it for people who ""LOVE"" Hilary Duff, cause it might disapoint you. but I love ""Fly"", ""Mr. James Dean"" & ""Cry"""
2,Hilary Duff,I'm surprised everyone loved it so much. I really liked metamorphosis. But i didn't this this cd was nearly as good. 17 songs it seems like she's gone for quantity not quality. But all the other reviews like it so i guess it's just me.
1,boo!,"Here's my album review...Album cover: I know for a fact she can afford a brush. Sheesh.Voice: Go learn how to sing, Hilary. We all know you're just in this for a quik buck.Lyrics: They're just a bunch of words squished together into a song. The lyrics are pathetic.Hilary's herself: Stop saying ""like"" five times every sentence. Stay away from Joel Madden, he's a bad singer/poser too but I still like him a heck lot better then you!The music: Her band isn't to good, but atleast they actually put some work into what they do!DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM, it's a waste of money. Try Evanescence or Jakalope if you want some real vocals!"
1,the hole in my wall,"my cousin bought this, dare i say album and while i sat listening to it, my head began to make a hole in the wall beside me while i cried with the thought that my dear, misguided cousin found this to be.... music? i cried.... yes, i'll admit, i cried.... tears streaming down my face as i tried to figure out why she would even make music.... please save yourself the pain, don't buy it."
3,"Metamorphisis Was Better, But This Ones Good...","I loved the first cd, it had a mixter of everything, This one's has a few good songs, except Fly could not be heared. But Some of it was very good. I loved The Getaway, and Jericho, snd s couple of others. I do see how she's growing up here on this album. Keep Up The Good Work...."
2,Don't buy this cd,"HI i am recomending you not to buy this cd. I have heard clips of each of the songs and read the lyrics to a few.The songs are OK but hilary duff's voice ruins them all.some of them have nice messages such as ""fly"" but other ones are really stupid and pointless.Some people say Hilary's talented but I completly disagree.Her voice sounds like a bunch of technical junk(too much effects on her voice but at least that prevents us from somthin much worse)and she's not that great an actor.the lizzie mcguire movie was good,accept for when hilary opened her mouth to sing.Plus I don't think she writes her songs and if she does then majority of them have no meaning.She may be a nice person but that is not a reason to buy this cd."
1,General Review of Hilary Duff,"Hilary Duff is not a good vocalist at all. Her voice is very nasal, her songs are very stupid, and she isn't as attractive as people think she is. If you want to invest money in a Disney Channel star CD, buy Raven-Symoné's ""This Is My Time"". This is one of those CDs that makes me wish that Amazon.com would give reviewers the power to give a CD zero stars."
1,Give Me A Break!,"This is the dumbest, babish crap I have ever herd in my life. This is cheesy crap for 11 and 12 year olds. As Entertainment Weekly Magazine put it ""Duff's voice, a tiny thing that continues to lack a shred of musical personality, is buried under layers of generic cheese arrangements."" Duff is only an ""artist"" because moms will buy this crap for their kids, which Disney knows. Little girls also like to think of this as ""rock"" but you can't be a rock star when you a talentless, Disney valley girl. When the her little girl fans grow up she will fade into former tween star history ala Tiffany Debbie style."
4,Hilary Duff,"I never bought this CD and I never borrowed it, I listened to it online. It sounds pretty good probably my favourite song would be Someone's Watching Over Me. To all you people out there who wonder what it sounds like try listening to it online before you buy it."
5,New Album,"This is a great CD. I recommend it to everyone. It has really great songs, plus the lyrics are good too. It has 17 total songs, more than Metamorphasis, so you can enjoy more. If you haven't already bought this CD you should do so quickly."
3,Pop Princess keeps 'em coming,"Hilary Duff has always been in the spotlight with music, movies, and TV shows. But this album is all about her. I recommend it for the younger age group around 9-14. I would let my children listen to it if I had any, because it definitely does not have explicit content. I think she really outdid herself this time."
1,"Good actor, bad singer","How did this girl become a singer in the first place? Even I can sing better then her. If this girl entered American Idol, she would not get in! Hilary has to get a clue and just stick with acting. Well, at least this album was better then her first one."
3,"somewhat embarrassing to say, but...","i actually like this. guess i'm getting weird in my old age. i grew up on a steady diet of prog-rock and, later in life, moved to mostly latin and rock en español.these poppy-dancey (as i call them) efforts are a major departure from what i'm used to, but they can be enjoyable, none the less. rock on, lizzy..."
1,Find real music Pop sucks,Go find real music instead of listening to this bull S***. Try Opeth or Tool for some truly talented artists.
3,Your Just One of Those Haters!,"This cd is a mix of both Pop and Rock. I don't like a few of the songs but the ones I do like are Haters (about Lindsay Lohan whom I love), Fly (from her movie Raise Your Voice and her only music video from this album), Mr. James Dean and The Getaway. Her debut album Metamorphosis is also a great album but her new cd is not so great. I hate the remixes but love Beat of My Heart, Wake Up and Break My Heart. The cover for this cd is awesome. Compared to her new look where she is ultra skinny and her teeth got really big. Anyways I would reccommend this cd and these other awesome Pop/Rock albums-Lindsay Lohan: Speak, A Little More Personal (Raw)Hilary Duff: Metamorphosis, Most WantedKelly Clarkson: Thankful, BreakawayGwen Stefani: Love, Angle, Music, BabyMy Chemical Romance: Three Cheers For Sweet RevengeFall Out Boy: From Under The Cork TreeAly and A.J.: Into The Rush-Cadee"
3,"Shes Cute and I Like Her, But..","This CD is okay and I like Hilary Duff but I prefer rock. Her first CD was pop also, but I liked the beat and rhythm better. I could listen to this CD maybe once every few weeks, but if it was everyday like my Avril CD, I'd go insane. Theres just something about the flow of music.. listen to the sample music and you might agree.."
3,SO/SO,"I had to admit when I bought this CD I thought it would be like Metamorphasis(which I didn't buy)I was a bit disapointed when I listened to the songs(besides ""Fly"") it's a bit like JoJo's album like the way, the first single kinda doesn't sound like the rest of CD. Overall I think it's something you have to listen to(go through all the songs) to really like it. Like someone said before the songs all kinda sound the same. Overall it was Okay So/So"
4,Great follow up that shows Duff's Growth inside and out,"Which would you rather listen to:A remake of Cameo's ""Word Up"" or some new material?I would choose the later. Hilary Duff is the ticket to the new material.Showing growth both inside and out, Duff helped co write some of her sophmore albums tracks. Tracks that show the maturity of this star. No more songs about math and high school crush's...now onto music with more meaning.Duff shows more inside growth that vocally. Not just a product of the media. Sure some would say she has no talent, but either do those that are doing terrible remakes of ""American Pie"" and ""Car Wash"". Those with the talent like some so called american idols, can't even pull off a debut album.Duff keeps us tuned in. Her image is great, and pulls listeners in. Whether you are looking for a role model or even a great song, Duff pulls it off by showing her growth in the most remarkable way."
5,Hil Rocks,"Hilary's new self titled album is a must have. It's a great follow up to her debut album. Not only does this album come with more then just 12 songs, each of them rock. Of course she has her single ""Fly"" on it, which is really good. It's a relaxing inspirational song. Hil's other song ""Someones watching over me"" from her new movie ""Raise your Voice"", is also an uplifting song. Besides ballads, Hilary also has some catchy tunes such as, ""Haters"", ""Do you want me?"", ""Mr. james Dean"" and ""Rock this world"". Plus she has some smooth rockish songs such as, ""Who's that Girl?"", ""Dangerous to know"", ""Get away"" and 'I am"". Overall Hilary did an amazing job on this album. ~Trace"
4,Good Job for Hilary.,"WOW! What a great job Hilary. Eventhough her voice not superb like Christina Aguilera, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey or Alicia Keys, but what she was done for this album was amazing. I like 'Fly' very much and I listen this track so many time. The other song that I think good are Shine and Who Thats Girl. Overall I give 4/5 for this album. Hope she will do more better for her 3rd album.1. Fly 5/52. Do You Want Me? 4/53. Weird 4/54. Hide Away 4/55. Mr. James Dean 4/56. Underneath This Smile 4/57. Dangerous To Know 4/58. Who That's Girl? 5/59. Shine 5/510. I Am 4/511. The Getaway 4/512. Cry 4/513. Haters 4/514. Rock This World 4/515. Someone's Watching Over Me 4/516. Jericho 4/517. The Last Song 4/5"
1,OMG IT'S HORRIBLE,"OMG this is the worst CD I've heard. I liked her first one ""Metamorphosis"" so of course I thought I would like this one even more. Gosh I was so wrong. It's like hard heavy-metal rock very much UNLIKE the last cd and did I mention she's trying to be something she's not??? I've learned to hate hillary and her voice. BTW WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH THE SINGIN ANYWAY??? What ever happened to acting...aka the thing she's good at? She's just trying to make more money than she already has... >:-0"
3,"Not my type of music, but good","Hilary Duff, not exactly the best vocal artist ever but enjoyable, being a 16 or 17 (somewhere around there) year old girl, many adult fans won't expect much. Some tunes are childish, well she is still a teenager so that's not surprising at all. Some Trite lyrics in the album, some tunes sound alike, but that's not surprising either. Overall, a good effort, not for all music fans but Hilary Duff is enjoyable to listen to."
3,The import is better,"The import has some extra tracks including the Haylie duet. It's an ok album I guess, I mean that's what computers are for. Anyway, like some reviewers say there are some songs that make you cringe. Hil is cute though."
1,Zoomba Zoomba!,"Great for doing Pilates while wearing my assless chaps. I want you to show me the way girl, everyday! OMG OMG OMG!"
3,"not hilary ""power puff"" anymore","hil is showing an edgier side to her look now, and i'm lovin' it! joel definatly did something good to her. anyway, this cd was ok. i only liked a couple songs though."
3,"A MASS MEDIA PRODUCT!If you write ""it sucks"" people bothers","Ok, I agree she sounds nice, looks nice, acts nice, but don`t tell me where she would be in 5 years from now.By the way, being young-blonde is a must to be supported by the studios?From all the current young stars, take Cristina Aguilera to the podium and leave the others go out."
5,One word for it... Amazing!,"Quite possibly the best cd I have heard! Hilary Duff is just so captivating and proves it on this incredible cd. She has an amazing voice, shown on such tracks as Hide Away, and has a quirky sense of style, shown by one of my favourites, Do You Want Me? The only song that was less than what I expected was James Dean, which was a little creepy and weird... But overall, it was awesome!"
4,a review on hilary's cd,"i used to not like hilary duff that much. this cd ROCKS! it is much better then her 1st cd. it had more of an edge to it and it is NOT bubblegum pop either. my favorite songs would have to be fly, weird, someone's watching over me and jericho. i am so glad that i bought this cd. i wasn't sure what to think of it but i think it is cool! you should by it!"
1,I don't get it,"I really don't understand Hilary Duff as a singer. I mean I've listened to this CD a number of times and I still don't get what the big deal is about her. To me, her voice is completly annoying. It's whiny, squeeky and just wrong. Oh and songs are TERRIBLE! I mean ""fly"" has got to be one of the worst pop/rock songs I've ever heard. Hilary Duff's self-titled CD is loaded with cliches, unecessary melodrama, and cheesy ""inspirational"" songs that will make you cringe. I seriously don't understand how she has music fans. There are way better singers of pop/rock music than this girl. HILARY DUFF is a mess. No substance and no fun."
1,Moo says the hilary duff,"Fat. Ugly. Untalented. Those should be lyrics in her gay songs. I'm suprised some people say she got this cause of looks! She got it cause disney owns Buena Vista! She has to hold Disney's hand through her career. This album sucks. I can't believe this trash is released when fiona apple's gold can't be. I hope that this is just sold in walmart. Walmart is one big trashcan, full of hilary duff merchandise, and dirtbags who buy her crap."
1,For cryin out loud,"How can anyone love Hilary Duff? She can't learn to act her age. When my older sister was seventeen she did a lot more stuff and said more stuff that Hilary can't even define and probably has to ask her mom to help her. Why does everybody think she's so mature? If she was, she wouldn't let Lindsay Lohan and other ppl bother her. Instead, she wrote ""Haters"" which is such a baby name with baby lyrics because her whole family are babies! Don't waste money on this."
2,Hilary hottie,"I'll give this album 2 stars for her looks, but the music isn't nearly as good as Ashlee Simpson's."
2,Not The Best,"I used to like Hilary Duff. Then, I heard Kelly Clarkson and found out what real singing is. My brother, still thinkin i liked Hilary, bought the second cd for me. I listened to it, because i was curious. Her voice isnt Horrible. it doesnt sound like a dying cow. But its not very good. The lyrics are kind of strange, but whatever floats your boat i guess. Save your money and buy 'Breakaway' by Kelly Clarkson."
1,A Kid's Review,"ok. i wouldn't waste my time buyin' this cd cus if u haven't noticed already, her songs sound all the same. its all about her sadness and depression. well guess what hilary??? WE DON'T CARE. WE WANNA HEAR SOME REAL MUSIC. NOT CRAP THAT YOU LIP SYNC. you were better off just actin' so just stay that way!!! o and that was for lindsay lohan and anybody that just came out of actin' to sing."
1,Big deal????,"Tell me whats so special about this girl, coz I dont know.... Common she doesnt have voice or body and her music stinks. Thanks god she isnt popular in Europe, at least we are save from another American sh**. First Hilary, than Ashlee and now Lindsay.... Do americans really have such bad taste in music???? If you like true rock try dutch singer anouk. She is something special."
2,No Way!!!,"This is one of the worst CD's I have ever bought, it sucks. The songs don't say anything, and they all sound the same. Her first Album is way, way better than this one."
1,Oh jeez.,"When she tries to belt out the chorus in ""Fly,"" she sounds like she's constipated. Yuck. I can almost see her vocal cords exploding. And the song sounds like it's copied from Evanescence or something...I thought that when I first heard it, and then her voice came on and I'm like ""This cannot be Hilary Duff, she sings pop music...wait. This IS Hilary Duff!"" And then I see recent pictures of her...dressed up like Amy Lee or Avril Lavigne. It's -scary.- Hilary, black nail polish, black eyeliner, and black clothes does not a punk rocker make. A few months ago, you were wearing burn-your-eyes-out-red lipstick and pink all over, then you start wearing black...?"
1,"this is worse than the first one,","Man this girl cant sing, and what is wrong with the world, I mean god, I'd rather listen to all of Millie Vanili, and LaToya Jackson's albums than listen to this one crappy album. And she makes LaToya Jackson sound like Whitney Houston.NO STARS it just has one because I had to put something, now go get Lindsy Lohans CD, at least she can sing."
5,hilary duff is the best,"i am a big and i mean BIG hilary duff fan. this is one of the many hilary duff cds i own and this happend to be my favorite. it has wonderfull dance-to songs. hilary takes the mike and turns it gold. good job hilary.(i want to say that ""most wanted"" is my new favorite performed by hilary duff. thankyou)"
5,It's one of the best!,"when Metamorphosis came out i wasn't really happy with it because it was bubble gum music when I'm more into rock and REAL pop. So when I heard ""Fly"" for the first time I fell in love with the song imedently. And i was more happy when I listened to the album as it got my 5 stars approvle. So people you should get this album if you are a pop/rock person and you WILL happy with this!"
5,Excellent:),"First, just so you know, I am 15, but I don't feel like getting an account to review stuff.Metamorphosis was a nice album, but Hilary's second is so much better. Though Hilary works hard on this album (17 songs!), it leaves you wanting more songs & excited about any possibility of a 3rd album. My favourites are Mr. James Dean & The Getaway."
5,hilary rocks,"She has learned how to rock!Hilary's c.d. is a master peace. Iloved ""the getway"" and ""haters"".The songs are very appropreitefor 7-10 year - olds. Hilary's songs really reflect her true personality.Over-all if you don't have her new c.d., you should get it!"
5,Big Improvement,"Hilary's new album shows that her voice and music style has matured. No worries, there's no explicit content on this new cd. She givs it all she's got, and this time she's giving some punk-rock feel to her music. If you liked her last cd, you'll fall in love with this one. And as for people who didn't like her last cd, this one is 10x better."
5,Awesome Cd!,"OK, I got this cd on the first day it came out, and it is AMAZING! The songs are upbeat and really full of energy, some songs are slow and sad, while others are energetic and fun to dance to. buy it, its awesome!- mo_man91"
4,Needed Some Editing,"Ever since getting her first non-holiday album ""Metamorphosis"", I loved her music. But this cd, it's more like a rush album. It's like she's just trying to release an album without really listening to it. Some songs like ""Haters"" should just be cut from the album. Who needs 17 songs on an album anyway!? ""Who's That Girl"" and ""Someone's Watching Over Me"" really shows the strong side of her voice. Maybe if they're was more time, the album would've been awesome."
4,This is a really good CD.,"This is a really good CD. And that is wierd that I say that because I love Rock music like MCR (My Chemical Romance) or Pantera. Two totally different kinds of Rock music, but both really good. So I give this album 4 stars because it is worthy of my rock ears!"
4,this album is OFF THE HOOK!!!!,i love hilary duff she is so beautiful and so talented. i love everything about hilary duff and i love the songs she does. she is a inspiration to me and i hope to other people aswell and i just want to be like her only BIGGER!!!sara x
5,Really awesome.,"Hilary's new self-titled album is just as good as her first, may be even better. The songs are cool and they mean a lot. I love it. It is really awesome and definitely worth the money. Hilary Duff sounds great and she has once again proved that she can rock this world."
2,Do You Want Her?,"Hilary Duff has proved she can rock (very little, but a bit) with her Self Titled follow-up to her milti-platinum success ""metamorphosis"". The album is full of catchy, hit songs that are radio friendly. ""Fly"", the first single, doesn't do very well in indecating Hilary's new direction but is a definite stand-out track nonetheless. The album is less overproduced than her first. One thing may bother you while listening to this CD though, the fact that she did not sing half of this, but relied on digital effects instead. The vocals on ""Mr. James Dean"", ""Shine"", and ""Wierd"" are too difficult for her to even attemt to sing live. With the majority of the album being recorded in a week, Hilary's voice is touched up far too many times and on tracks like ""I Am"", and ""Do You Want Me?"" her voice is suffering from a bad cold. This album overall is a joy to listen to and beter than her first attempt but she will never be able to prove herself if she doesn't start singing live."
1,Dear Hilary Duff....SHUT UP!!!!,"I think I speak for everyone who appreciates real music when I say SHUT UP! Hilary is manufactured by Disney and you see her everywhere. In my opinion she has replaced Britney Spears in terms of influence on a young girls minds, and trust me, I have met many. Hilary just shut up, I had no problem when you were on the lizzie mcguire show as I didn't see it anyway and everywhere. But now with you ""growing up"" and doing VERY ANNOYING commercials for ice breakers and tons of bad movies, I speak for everybody who has at least half a brain or even brain cell when I say SHUT UP! Bad music, bad voice, bad lyrics and song writing and bad influence on girls in that they become idiots and have the ability to listen to real music to be taken away from them. Look, the fan base is 7th graders, just like Avril Lavigne. You will look back on this as an embarrassment to your childhood, so get out while you can.P.S. Oh yeah, Hilary....SHUT UP!!!!"
1,why is this alien trying to make us like it>???,"hilary duff is one of the worst entertainers of all time... she does not even deserve the title 'entertainer'... she is horrible in every way... she cannot act, she cannot sing, and she definatley is not a looker... i wish lindsey lohan would get more attention than her....and why is she singing behind rock music... HOW DARE SHE!!!!!! she is no rocker....ashlee simpson is a better rocker (why did i just say that>?)if this jaberwakki looking thing stops making music, movies, and crap and focuses more on school we would not be brainwashed to listen this (CURSE WORD).....i just hate the thing... holla"
2,It kind of upset me...,"I was a Hilary Duff fan but I have to say that this CD was a huge let down. There are barely three good songs on the CD. Everything is so banal and cliche... I can't even stand to listen to it. The lyrics are terrible, and in no way has she matured on her sophomore debut- whoever said that must've listened to the wrong CD."
2,STICK TO ACTING!!!,Hilary duff tried way to hard to be a rocker chick on this CD. The lyrics to Do Ya Want Me suggest that she is incredibly immature and is a little confused. Mr.James Dean is the most irritating song we've ever heard.The screaming get incredibly annoying. Most people under the age of 13 have clue who James Dean is.James Dean had aready died long before Hilary was born.We are a little confused at the songs on this CD because first she sings about hating people(Haters) Then sings about love taking over the world.She's a bit to animimated on the CD and strains her voice alot.Your a pretty girl Hilary-Stick to acting!
1,I h8 hillary,"This cd SUCKS!!!!! The only one who should listen to this is 6 year olds! if you want to hear some REAL music try Norma Jean or Queens Of the Stone Age! Avril Lavigne is NOT PUNK either! there is no such thing as pop/punk, the only ones who call themselves that are punk posers!"
1,Hilary Duff is so DUFF!!!,"This album's Hilary Duff's most freaky album,worse than Metamorphosis Duff and Most Freaky Songs albumsit's just so boring,i have no way to say.This album should change the title into:'THE BEST FUNERAL ALBUM ALL-TIME'iMeRie"
2,"Sorry, Hilary, but you need to move over...","I hate hilary duff. Don't kill me for this, but she has no more talent than any other slightly trained 17 year old girl. She is just a wannabe that got INCREDIBLY lucky.This is all I'm going to say. If you liked lizzie mcguire or cheaper by the dozen, stick to the movies. don't get her albums.(...)-Renneme"
4,Hilary's Newest Album,"I own both of Hilary's albums. The first was okay, and I did like it quite a bit, but when I compare it to this one, well, it's not as good as I thought is was!Hilary's explores a deeper and more rocky tone in this album, though a few of them have a softer beat, there are definitely differences between her two albums.The first album was a more preppy cd with songs like Sweet Sixteen. It definitely was a bridge between tween queen to the awesome diva she is now.This album explores an older side, and a bit more dangerous side of Hilary. Like one of her lyrics ""It's dangerous, so kiss me"" and ""Some secrets need to be kept..."" you can tell that she is looking for something a bit more different.Also, Hilary includes 2 of my favorite songs from her movie ""Raise Your Voice,"" which are ""Someone's Watching Over me"" and ""Jericho.""All in all, I'd say this is one of Hilary's best works yet."
5,Hilary ROCKS,"Ahh!! How could you NOT want to buy this cd!? The songs are great, her voice is awesome, and it's just the kind of CD that makes you want to get up and dance!! (Which is what I would be doing if I wasn't sitting here typing this review!!!)How I rate the songs ~Fly: 10/10Do You Want Me?: 9/10Weird: 10/10Hide Away: 7/10Mr.James Dean: 9/10Underneath this smile: 9/10Dangerous To Know: 10/10Who's That Girl?: 11/10!!!!!Shine: 8/10I Am: 9/10The Getaway: 10/10!!Cry: 7/10Haters: 8/10Rock This World: 9/10Someone's Watching over me: 9/10Jericho: 10/10The Last Song: 6/10"
5,"Hilary Duff, better than the first!","Yes, the long anticipated wait for the 2nd Hilary Duff cd, has finally come!!! Which includes her hit single ""Fly"" and so many more songs. I consider it better than the first,""Metamorphosis"", though I love both! This is definitely a more deep cd than her first, which can hit teens of all ages! If you are a Hilary fan, this is a MUST get for all. I love all the songs on this cd, And you will 2! This is defenetly a more deep cd than her last, which can hit teens of all ages!"
3,metamorphosis was better,"This Cd is not bad however I really liked the first one better. This one also seems to have subliminal sexual content. Keep that in mind. So did the first one. Here are some lyrics from one of her songs.""You roll me, you use me, you love me and thenYou wrap me up and reel me in and use me againYou love me, you hate me, you say it's the endI know you're gonna do it again and again..."""
1,why hilary? WHY?,"hilary is a sweet pretty girl but why is it that everytime a young girl is successful at acting she's gotta put out an album to make more money for the masses when she can't even sing to save her life? Her music videos help her album sales because she can act and may act out the musical messages, but she performed horrible on the world music awards and she can't sing at all, she should just stick to acting instead. That goes for lindsay lohan and company too"
1,unfortunate,"it is unfortunate to those who purchase this cd. this is by far the worst .....and i REALLY mean worst ""singers"" (cough, cough) in history. hillary duff is single handedly the reason i cannot stand pop. everytime i hear one o her so called ""songs"" i really want to hit someone (mainly her) she needs to stop doing this to people. she could get someone killed! so this message gopes straight out to her- stp ruining the world! you suck and your music sucks...BAD. turn while you can and do not get this awful album!"
1,WORST EVER !!!,"Alright , this album sucks . JUNK! JUNK! JUNK! Some songs are ok (""Fly"", ""Who's that girl"") but it's not worth buying since the rest of it SUCKS and don't even have any senses. Hilary Duff voice is worse. She should've stick to Lizzie McGuire and NEVER NEVER EVER release an album"
1,ugh...more crap,"I am 17 and I am already sick and tired of today's music scene (and thats excluding rap, which I don't consider to be music) The current crop of female singers are simply terrible and have done nothing to deserve their attention. If you actually want to be able to remember a song after hearing it a dozen times, try early Joni Mitchell. If you want easy accessible pop, try the Beatles. If the thought of listening to something older than five years scares you, at least try a band or singer that writes his or her own music; Franz Ferdinand or early Jewel. Their songs areall a thousand times better than Hilary Duff could ever hope to be. Not that Duff would know, seeing as how she doesn't actually write music or play an instrument. What an age when being pretty and being able to squeak out a few notes gets one at the top of the Billboard Charts. The fact that she has been able to pollute the airwaves with yet another CD is absolutely sickening"
2,Down The Duff,"Theres good and bad news here. Good News: Hilary is a fantastic role model to young girls and sets a good example. Bad News: This album is only for die hard fans. Hilarys voice really doesn't agree with me, the only standout 2 standout songs here are ''I Am'' and ''Fly''...I think she needs to put emotion in her voice and maybe stick to her lower register in her voice...because the bit in 'Fly' which goes ''Can you hear it calling'' really doesn't sound good, and sounds really off. I have nothing against her as an actress or a person, but I think the hair brush should be the only thing witnessed to hear her singing voice."
3,Self Titled,"For her second album release, this album is just as better than the first. For a 16 year old, she has a beautiful voice. Her lyrics, whether she wrote them or had professionals write them are good. Ms. Duff's first single ""Fly"" is the best song out of the 17-track disc. Other tracks that are worth a listen are ""Who's That Girl"", ""Shine"", ""Hideaway""."
1,Useless,"Hilary Duff should be chased after with pitchforks and torches for creating an album (TWO even). She can't sing. Simple as that. My friend got this CD as a present from her little sister, and it pains me to hear her whiny voice through the stereo. I would disown my friend if she actually listened to this music seriously, instead of as a joke. Can't you see how nasal her voice is? She has no talent whatsoever. She might have decent lyrics, she might have something to say (I'm not sure... she MIGHT) but she should not SING those messages. I'm not meaning to be dissing her or anything, she just shouldn't sing. At all. Ever. Unless her life depended on it. Her voice has no power and no strength, and people shouldn't sing unless they have decent voices. Unless you're Kurt Cobain. Play some music of people with strong voices (it doesn't matter if you hate them and their music) and then compare. Why doesn't she sound whiny to anyone else?"
5,Got to love Hilary!,"My daughter is a huge fan of Ms. Hilary Duff, as is her Mom. A great CD for all fans. A++++"
1,"Horrible CD, Horrible Singer","Hilary Duff is just somebody who thinks she is good but she really isn't, no talent."
5,Metamorphosing Again,"Beware Ashlee Simpson, here comes Hilary Duff....again! In just a years time, Hilary Duff has completely changed her music style. Bubblegum pop to Pop/Rock, this c.d. is definitely one worth picking up. My personal favorite songs are ""Weird"", ""Rock This World"" and ""The Getaway"". You can tell this c.d. is definitely more personal and she is starting to let her emotions out. Finally, she swings back to all the ""Haters"" out there, and tells you how she really feels about them."
3,makes the job easier,The tool works great. It is a lot easier using this tool instead of using a oil wrench. The only draw back with the tool was getting it off the oil filter housing after you loosen it because it turns just enough that is binds on the housing.
3,I now have more ports...,"I have more ports now, which is what I wanted. BUT, it's flimsy and poorly built. I feel like I have to handle it with kid gloves so as not to damage it. Nothing horrible, but would be nice if it were more rugged."
5,Not a New Album. This is after circle. Lost tracks is good.True Danzig.,"Several versions, including some that might have been played live but never released such as when death had no name. My favorite is his cover of Bowie's Cat People(I dont care for bowie much, and this cover is better than the original) Another good one is Buick Mccain(real rock, not metal.)and Come to Silver(different version), cd 2 is better than cd 1, not really a boxset, its two cds, a booklet and a comic(weird one of course) Wish danzig would go back to Old Danzig. But oh well. he's a shockmeister."
2,"These Tracks Were Lost for a Reason, Weren't They?","As much as I love this band's early work and as cool as this collection's packaging looks, I couldn't find a single track on this double CD that didn't justly deserve to be left out in the cutting room floor. Quality wise, the vast majority of the tracks here are on the crappy b-side level, that is, bad or unrealized ideas suffering from a substandard production. The only decent song here is When Death Had No Name, no wonder we get two versions, and while Cold Cold Rain could make a great song if it wasn't for Glenn's lethargic vocal performance and the demo quality sound, the worst stinker of the bunch is undobtedly White Devil Rise, a lame white power tirade that is just too ludicrous to even be ofensive. For the obsessive Danzig completist only, everyone else should just stick to the band's first four albums. Note: The Two star rating is for the packaging only."
4,The lost tracks of Danzig,"Splendid choice for Danzig collectors. This 2cd set is quite ok, no matter that some songs are not very, very good. Every song has an annotation, that's good! As always cool, a bit satanic and darkly erotic metal."
5,26 tracks of pure genius,"Wow. I hope if there are more unreleased Danzig tracks floating around that he releases those eventually, too, because this is incredible. Danzig fans will find a bunch of new favorite songs on here (I know I already have). All the sounds of Danzig are represented here, from aggressive, hard-rocking songs, to soulful, mournful, beautiful songs like ""Crawl Across Your Killing Floor,"" ""Cold, Cold Rain"" and ""Come to Silver."" ""White Devil Rise"" is just pure fun, as is the album's artwork! The comic-book style liner notes have a ton of great photos and notes by Glenn on the history of each song, and the ""cover"" of the comic book is just plain hilarious. It's a total treat for fans."
3,"Good stuff for fans of the ""old"" Danzig","This is a 2 disc set. I found the first disc to be the real prize, being made up of b side tracks from Danzig's first 3 albums, Christ on guitars, Chuck Biscuits on drums. The second disc is a little more modern era, so isn't worth to much to me, but still this set is worth having if you are a fan of early Danzig."
5,It's about time.,"I've been waiting for something like this since Danzig 2. It has some amazing stuff. If you liked his first 3 (4?) albums you'll love this one. I rank em Danzig 1, Danzig 2, then this one."
2,danzigs turdie tracks,"Danzig 1,2,3, stop there 3 great albums , everything after that is when he turded things up going NeW MEtal . there are a few good songs on this one i would agree ,but most of it is boring album fillers , thus not making the cut , 3 songs should have made it to album , you decide, its like seeing him live its awesome if ya wanna sit through 5 bad songs for one good one , shake that money maker glenn"
3,"Fun, filthy garage punk, but nothing original","The Catheters sound like the Hives trying to sound like the Stooges and Mudhoney. And they do a good enough job. It's a fun album to rock out to, but there's nothing unique about it. Standard, formula rock. VERSE CHORUS VERSE CHORUS SOLO CHORUS CHORUS all the songs sound like songs you've heard before. But if you don't mind that, give it a shot. And the kids in the band are pretty cute, which is always a plus. (that's why I bought their album in the first place -- a saw their picture and thought they were hot... but don't tell anyone, Kay?)"
3,Only pictures,"I thought that I would find at least little texts about the work done in each film or picture, but the books only shows images and more images from famous animation films and other films that used CGI. If you'd like to see many photos then buy it, otherwise choose a book with more things to say."
3,Just a fine book,"This isn't deep-covering book and sometimes I even felt that more info could be. It's minuses from my point of view is that it very rarely mentions software used in production of images and 3D stuff(Maya and Photoshop mentioned). I myself know around what kind of software things are going commonly but many 3D beginners who could look for inspiration of this book may suffer. Yet still - it is good book, nice choice of pictures and one thing also must be mentioned - Weishar himself mentions in the book that he even didn't intended to make best of best and that is not he claims his book is! Careful reading is a good pointStill, those who seek the book with good quality pictures - this is good choice."
5,Great album!!,It is an excellent CD. I'll recommend it to all flute lovers. It shows a very good musician that express his talents at all extend. One of the best flute musician I have ever heard.
4,Simple Pleasures is a simple treasure,"Relaxing and inspiring ideas are contained in this lovely little book. It was very refreshing to see such simple ways to treat yourself or sooth your soul. I am definitely stocking up to give as bridal shower gifts, etc."
1,Aint worth it,"I rented this movie, but after a while, I couldnt understand why I end up seeing it, if you want just downloaded, but You will regret it"
3,An interesting pictorial with useful text,"This fine book, actually a union of two sources, Gustav Stickley's catalog and the Stickley brothers' undated catalogue, also contains some interesting text from both sources.The pictures, although small, are faithfully reproduced from the original catalogues, and can be used to more fully understand the general concepts of the Arts and Crafts style of furniture. Enough items are represented to be able to design similar items on your own."
2,What HYPE!! And who told that guy that he could sing ????,"With vocals less melodic than the quality of a screeching, ... cat this otherwise decent composition is ruined. Add to that a lack of elementary recording engineering finesse, mixed appearantly without the aid of speakers or headphones. Most (not all) of Mellon Collie is a pain to listen to due to the severe lack of instrument definition (and yes, those skull-driiling vocals), much of the CD sounding more as though it were recorded all on one track, in one take, on a very disagreeable day, in a VERY hot garage, with one bad microphone. Now, if you want to hear The Smashing Pumpkins on better days (and apparently more capable sound engineers) you'd be better off listening to their CDs ""Adore""; ""Gish"", and ""Pisces Iscariot""."
1,TEN SEPERATE THINGS TO INFLATE!,"As cute as the pool looks, having to blow up no less than TEN seperate air compartments - the tree and base it sits on even have to be blown up seperately - is absolutely not worth it."
3,It's okay,I thought this would be a good indoor water toy but it gets too messy.This would be better outdoors. It was easy to blow up with pump. It really didn't keep the boys interest too long. I really wouldn't recommend. I like the idea but it wasn't a great choice for us.It is durable but doesn't hold the boys attention.
3,"Similes, metaphors and well used phrases","I laughed my way through the first half of Indiana Gothic. In true soap opera style, there's not a metaphor, simile, well used phrase or silly word that Mr. Brock missed. My favorite was the ""indigo sauce"" of the blueberry pie. But when he finally narrates the events of the trial, he sneaks in a few nice plain declarative sentences.Still, I read on. I wish there were fewer gaps in the story. How was it that one spouse was tortured by the resemblance of the ""love child"" to its father while the other spouse carried on in blissful oblivion? I needed to know more about what happened to Allie and her eldest son. (I sorely desired that the latter become an accomplished and wealthy gambler.) The relationship between Allie, the adulteress and Maggie, the wounded wife, was not drawn to my satisfaction. What role did their parents play? And my goodness: how did Maggie and Ham's younger brother get together after Ham's death?"
2,"Slow, boring book","I was quite disappointed with this book. The book is very slow, often boring, and most of the characters are very sketchy. While the description of life and places at those times could have been interesting, you feel like it's interrupting the story rather than enriching it."
5,Very well written,"This was truly a page turner and was written so well, it was easy to visualize all the events happening in the 1800s. One of the best books I have read this year."
2,At least it works,"This belt clip is pretty bulky, but the real problem is that it is difficult to turn your shuffle on and off. You have to take it out of the belt clip (not that easy if you're wearing it) in order to turn it on and off. That said, you can't exactly go to the apple store to find accessories for the old shuffles anymore. If you can find another one you should probably go with that one, if not... it's cheaper than buying a new shuffle."
4,Good DVD!,"This is an awesome DVD! Every Kelly fan should own one. It has great footage like Soundcheck, an interview, a video and of course, the concert. I really like her cover of ""Sunglasses at Night"", much better than Corey Hart's. The only slight problem with this is DVD is the video quality, like on the video for ""Changes"", its widescreen, when it's suppsosed to be full screen, so it looks stretched. But besides that, the concert was great and Kelly rocks. She has her own thoughts and opinions and doesnt care what anybody says or thinks of her, as the 16 min. interview proves. Buy this DVD if your even the least bit of a Kelly fan, you will enjoy it and will get you into her even more and show you how cool of a person she is. Ignore the f'ed up, ignorant things alexis_whatever said, im not going to say anything because it's stupid. BUY THIS DVD!!"
3,Why?,"What's the point of this album? Yeah, all of Brownstone's love songs are on here, and they're all good, but why a collection like this? They only had two albums! Maybe they were trying to fulfill their contract with Sony; I don't know."
3,Not Just for Harem Fans,"Why is it that most harem Anime happen to have a guy who really isn't a pervert, but gets beat up because the girls think he is a pervert. Possibly, this has to do with the fact that the creators don't want to be called out as being sexist by having a guy who can go around actually being a pervert as the main characters and not get beat up.Asu No Yoichi is the type of Anime that has a serious plotline, but then ends up filled with a ton of crack humor. The jokes are harem based... in other words, they deal with sexual situations. However, these jokes are also not offensive and come across as funny. There are other side jokes and crack humor not related to the series being a harem, my favorite being the constantly shrinking best mate of the guys rival.It honestly isn't the best show out there, but to me it was an enjoyable watch. It may not be everyones cup of tea, however, it is worth checking out one time at least to see if you like it and it is yours."
2,STICK WITH MANGA,"VIDEO WAS DISAPPOINTING AND WATERED DOWN, NEVER HAD TIME TO BUILD THE CHARACTER OR THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. IT WAS A POOR ATTEMPT AT CAPTURING SOMETHING THAT WAS GREAT AS A MANGA. JUST DIDN'T TRANSLATE WELL. I'D BUY THE MANGA INSTEAD."
2,Adhesive makes a mess,"I applied this film per the instructions and it looks awful. I've installed several films on windows in the past, but this one is the only one I've seen that has adhesive on the back. The others all relied on surface tension, which has always worked great. The adhesive on this product got all gooped up behind the plastic film as I squeegeed out the bubbles. It's up there firmly, but it looks terrible. I wrote to the company to ask for help, but no response. I will have to take it down and replace it with the non-adhesive variety, but I'm not looking forward to it - I imagine it's going to take a while to get it off..."
2,Don't Be Fooled By The Image,"Paul Q's reveiew was right. Don't let the image on your monitor fool you. This case is SMALL. And even if it has a 'spec' of around 5-6 inches, it narrows-down so much at the bottom, and with all the paddding and side pockets, all you get in the interior bottom portion of the case is a 2X4 inch usable section. I'd be surprised if they make a camcorder that would fit inside, but I guess they do. But to me, it looks like I'd barely get a flat, medium sized digital camera to fit inside. Yes, it's a real nice case. However, just don't expect to fit very much inside."
3,All you can get until something better comes out,"The CastleVania series has some of the best music in early video game history and it's kinda sad that there hasn't really been an audio compilation outside of playing the game. This is really the only cd I've been able to locate, and it is a bit diappointing.I don't own a gameboy, and one game is Japanese exclusive anyway, so most of the music is unfamiliar to me. There are a few classic CV tracks - Vampire Killer, The Castle Intro, Boss Battle, but the quality and remixing leave a lot to be desired.The sound files are sound quality comparable to Super Nintendo, a bit disappointing when audio game files are now released in cd or dvd quality sound.If you are a huge Castlevania Fan, this is pretty much all there is in the audio selection, and it's pretty hard to get, so grab it. It's better than nothing."
4,Collectors find use for Datigs books,"Cartridges for Collectors, Volume 1, 2 and 3 is a very detailed and informative book on cartridges for the collector. There is much information in an easy to read format. However, many of the cartridges are experimental Swiss and other one of a kind European Cartridges. There is also plenty of info between the 3 volumes on American Centerfire, rimfire and military cartridges. It is a useful tool for some hard to find cartridges."
4,Typical Burt,"Well, I read this book in one day. Started it, and 24 hours later I was done. Didn't want to set it down. If you liked Burt's previous two books, I'll bet you like this one as well.What supprised me the most was reading about some of the folks who Buddy meets along his adventures and thinking ""Hey, I know/knew those folks, too."" It certainly made the book more interesting for me.The only down side was, since I had a preview edition, there were enough typos to be distracting. Shouldn't be an issue as the final version is supposed to be out.Burt does get extra credit for having the advertising section in the middle of the book. It's a great idea."
4,"Last Open Road, part III","Burt ""BS"" Levy again captures the feel of the golden age of American sports car racing in the early 1950s. He mixes historic figures in with the familiar gang from Last Open Road and Montezuma's Ferrari. The story drags at times, as Buddy's soliloquies - which in moderation are very effective at establishing the mindset of these more innocent times - pile a bit too deep. The reader would be grateful for a little judicious editing. Still, this book is a fitting indulgence for the sports car nut, especially, and Levy delivers a depth that is both unexpected and rewarding."
5,Amazing and exquisite,"I had never heard of this man before but no sooner did I listen to his version of ""You Raise Me Up"" than I became an instantaneous fan of this guy. Brian Kennedy is amazing and his voice is so exquisite! Sung in tribute of the late George Best,the style and the stark pathos underlinig the music of this song is so soothing to the soul. I've listened to the song again and again but still can't get enough of it. I also possess the Westlife track of the same song but the depth in feelings and the lofty sombre tone that is so readily revealed by Brian Kennedy is missing in the Westlife version. Everyone should get this CD at once!"
4,tagged,Good product at good price. The tags wear well on active dogs. OwnerAlert is a great service. I highly recommend it.
5,Great Sounding!,"I bought this for my boat. I wanted a horn with a lower tone, not one with a BEEP or TWEET or something like that. The sound on this horn is as advertised, loud but lower in tone. I like the sound of it plus the price was good!"
1,Poor quality replacement horn,"First off, It doesn't look like the picture, not that big of deal since you wont really be looking at it anyway, but worth noting. Easy enough to install, if you have 30 minutes or so, but the quality of the horn is awful. I had it installed for a couple days, and used it maybe 5 times before it gave out, it just makes kind of a rattley weak dying goat noise now. Besides, if you are going to try to replace any sort of stock truck horn, (full size) this isn't going to be much louder if any at all. Not worth the trouble, get something better."
3,Worked great - Once!,"Unfortunately I only got one good blast out of this horn and then - KAPUT!The one blast i did get sounded great! So - poor quality control is my guess - returning the horn for another and I'm sure it'll work great, as I've bought Wolo horns in the bast and never had any problem...Is not for past good experiences with Wolo products, I probably would have given a much worse review but I know they'll make good."
3,"Easy installation, not very loud","The horn came with all the bits necessary to replace the custom connector on my Saturn, making installation quick and easy. But the horn isn't very loud. (It's as loud as the stock Saturn horn, but not louder as I expected a horn labeled ""LOUD-ONE"" and ""better quality for louder sound"" to be.)"
2,WYSWYG not in this case...,"Ok, good price, but Amazon's photo of item does not match what they ship... a bit dissapointed they did this."
3,"Coin Clinic : 1,001 Frequently Asked Questions","This book was a little out dated and not very fluent reading. Might be good for a beginner, many of the questions were redundant."
2,not great,"I bought this supporter to use for Krav Maga self-defense training. The supporter will see a great deal of movement in all directions, and I need the supporter to hold the protective cup firmly in place at all times. The narrow attachment of the supporter at the waist line and the position of the straps make this supporter feel insecure and just uncomfortable. I typically wear compression shorts over every supporter for extra stability. I suppose that this one will work well enough with the compression shorts, but I think they'd have a better product if they'd widen the pocket and the straps to provide more side to side stability. For someone in a sport where most movement is forward and backward or even up and down, this supporter may work very well. The comfort of a narrow attachment will obviously be a matter of personal preference, and I could see where the narrow attachment might inhibit motion less if most motion is running."
1,Not at all what I expected from the show,"I loved season 1 and season 2 - laughed and really enjoyed them. But seasons 3 and 4 - I wasted $40! Doris Day has done so much better! Totally different than the first two seasons.. gone were the kids, and the comedy, the ""working mother of two"" and is now the woman all men are after and suddenly she is on the wealthy side of things! I have watched both seasons today and haven't cracked a smile. It's like they took a low budget drama storyline and tried, unsuccessfully, to put some comedy in to the story. The storylines were just to serious to be comedic. The liveliness and comedy in these 2 seasons is completely missing... stick with the first 2 seasons!"
1,What happened to this show!!!???,"I bought and watched the first 3 seasons of this show and although it's not the best show in history, it had it's good points. But what happened in the 4th season?-This became a mess!! Most of the stories don't make any sense to me, and are rarely funny. I thought the first season was so sickening sweet the first time I watched it. I longed for it after watching these episodes! The Christmas show has Santa carrying a gun throughout the show? I wonder if it was Doris' idea to change the format. I can't imagine what the fifth season is going to be. What a let down!!!I've given the 5th season a chance and it is an improvement over the 4th year."
2,What was I thinking?,"Doris Day was an icon on the Hollywood screen. So, when CBS(I think) was pitched a series with her, they snapped it up. There is a lot of airtime in these collections. BUt, through it all, there are few laughs. It was never that funny, but her star power kept the show on the air. She was so much a part of Americana that hairdressers had a hairdo, including blond highlights, ready and waiting. A lot of women signed up, including my mother. Unfortunately, that contributed -0- to the show which ostensibly was a comedy. The only thing on the show that was even microscopically interesting were the fashion shows she did once per year. That was hardly enough to buy a full series, a full season, or even a small collection of shows on one disk."
5,Stimulates the imagination,"Got these dolls for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. How can two floppy-armed, floppy-legged, hard-torso dolls be any fun? I have been amazed! Her imagination with them is just like seen in the Toy Story movies. The pull-string phrases are now all memorized, and I hear them at the most laughable times.Quality is good enough. After all, they are meant to be just like the ones in the movie, and they are. The pull-string is nothing like that from my childhood, i.e. mine were mechanical, had tension that wound something up, and lasted a long time. Instead, the string has no tension and simply activates a battery operated device. And that brings me to my only real complaint. Seems as if every battery operated toy now comes with three AG13 button batteries. They cost $3 each, or in some places you can get a six pack for $12. They wear out too fast and are not rechargeable. I'd prefer two rechargeable AAA any day.But, my granddaughter loves the dolls, and that's what matters."
3,Woody/Jesse combo pack review,My daughter loves the toys. My problem is that I went with Amazon first assuming that I was getting a good deal. When I went to Toys R Us the nxt day. They had the same product for 1/2 the price. I will not be coming to Amazon first again!
4,Woody and Jesse,"My little girl is really into the Toy Story 1&2. We had picked up an Woody before; however, it didn't say any of things from the movie. When we saw the combo pack, we knew she would love it...and she does. She has them when she is watch the movies and during nap time."
3,This price is outrageous!!! Can find them much cheaper in the stores!!,"My son loves his Woody and Jesse dolls. They are getting quite tattered because he takes them everywhere he goes so I went on-line to look first; save time. This price is outrageous!!! Much cheaper in stores. People are just way too greedy nowadays. They have the original Woody and Buzz dolls, bigger and better for less, out again...wal-mart, k-mart and toys r us."
4,Just what I was looking for,I ordered this for a Christmas present & I think it will fit the bill perfectly!
5,A Refreshing Note in the Manga Genre,"When I first saw this title on amazon, it rang a bell. I soon realized I had heard this was one of the manga titles that had won one of the most prestigious manga awards in Japan. After ordering it and reading it, I soon saw why.While many people enjoy manga simply for the cute characters or the romance, I'm one of those who appreciate the art. The art in Nodame Cantabile is not incredibly detailed or extremely cute, like many shoujo manga. It is simple but interesting, and it has a defined style.The story itself is also wonderful right from the start. A young man is in a music school where everyone works hard to achieve their goals. The characters are lively and interesting- the male protagonist is slowly changing his cynical ways, and his female counterpart is unique and interesting. All the people they meet along the way are also certainly well done.Nodame Cantabile is a great work of manga, and it's our luck that it has been translated into English."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 1 1/2 year old little boy who loves Curious George, and though I realize it was only around $8, I'm really disappointed in the quality of the stuffed animal. The description says it's a ""beanbag plush"" (which it's not) and ""by Applause/Russ Berrie"" (which it's not - the tag says ""Kellytoy""). It reminds me of something you would win out of $.50 claw game. It's definitely going back!"
4,curios george,perfect!!!! just the right size for a very active 2 yr old to play with she loves it and never puts it down
3,Really tiny but cute decoration,"Again, used for decoration at a baby shower. It sat on top of the cupcake holder. It was cute, but not for play until the child is much older."
2,is it a keychain?,"The look of George is distinctiveThe size should be from fingers to elbowI guess I thought eight inches would do itRulers aside, this one didn't measure up"
3,Just okay,"My husband got this for our monkey obsessed daughter and while it was appreciated- and he is a very well loved little monkey in our home- I am not impressed. This plush is stiff, scratchy, not plush at all, and for the price I'd have expected it to be bought at the dollar store. About all I can say good about it is our daughter doesn't seem to care and it's held up well in the wash thus far. There are better quality Curious George products and certainly better quality monkey plush on this site, though, and I'd advise you to look for them before you spend your money on this one."
1,Awful,My son LOVES Curious George...but this doll is so oddly shaped...stitched in all the wrong places...looks extremely homemade and a complete joke of George. Got this for the price and wouldn't even let my son see it before I got rid of it.
2,not so good,I bought 2 of them and one was fine but the other had no mouth or finger stitching. not worth paying to send it back.
1,Not as advertised,"We just received the plush Curious George today. First off the advertisement on Amazon says its by Russ/Applause, which is why I bought it, because they are good quality. But its by Kelly Toys. Horrible quality. The mouth is sewn crooked, the eyes are scratched up and it is stiff as a board. The fabric is very thin and not soft at all. When I gave it to my little boy, who is 2 and loves George, he looked at it and threw it back at me. He never does that. Don't spend 1 cent on this item. It is now a dog toy for our 2 terriers."
3,Curious George,"George has been a family favorite for many years. It was good to find one for our grandbaby. It is just the right size to carry around and brings back memories for the rest of us. We would have like to have found one with a hat, like the origionals, but this one is still a good value."
2,I wanted to like it.,"I really did. However, this toy was poorly constructed and the paint/lettering was already peeling from his shirt. He's a little smaller than 8 inches too. The seems are already pulling. A bit disappointing for adults, but the kids still liked him."
3,good cards but too specific,"I bought these cards several months ago and yes I really love the imagery( although I feel that some of the angels have been protrayed in a tacky pornographic way eg: sonya, vanessa etc).The meanings stated on each card are far too specific which in my view prevents the intuitive aspect to enter the reading. The problem thaT i HAVE WITH THESE CARdS is the fact although Doreen Virtue had tried to make it easier for the card reader to give a reading she has in fact done the opposite.I often recieve cards that mean something completely different from what is stated on the card. For example I once recieved Chantelle the angel of romance and on this card it siad that I was going to meet someone new and have a romantic relationship with this person. But in fact it tuned up because a relationship was ending at the time (this was indicated by doing the tarot alongside the angels!) I recommend mixing both decks of angel cards together as this gives very good readings!"
2,for those who read books like these or more hard hitting subjects......,"this book can come across as pink, bubbels, rainbows and flowers. for those who read books in this nature but with more hard hitting subjects, i wouldent recomend buying it, instead read a few chapters for yourself in a libary. doren virtue seems to channel angles, but shes writting books just for money as she never relly writes stright foward answers to thhe questions. those who do already channel angels, you already know the score but buy and angle book off her anyway, most channelers have one somewhere.on the other hand if you are having a bad, day/month/ year. this book may make you cry and allow you to feel good about yourself for a moment or two. or you could just have a lobley bath with pink bubbles and rainbows, instead of reading about them."
5,I LOVE this book!!! Thank you Angels!,"This book came into my life when I most needed it. The angel messages are truly insightful. They are simple yet powerful. The topics covered are close to our hearts, the format of the book is nice. Doreen could not have made this any easier read for us. I cannot stop going ""aha!"" as I turn the pages."
5,"Prepare for a warm, cuddly hug","Reading ""Messages from Your Angels"" is like getting a big hug from someone you love! It made me more keenly aware of my surroundings, i.e., music playing on the radio, the scent of someone's perfume, wind chimes ""singing"" in a soft breeze. It made me feel more in touch with those who have passed on and helped me feel more at peace living in their absence.Cynthia Briggs, Cookbook AuthorPork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and ReflectionsSweet Apple Temptations"
2,Potassium/Sodium Imbalance -- Too Much Sodium,"I like the mix of ingredients as they are good for you and can boost your output -- all EXCEPT the large amount of sodium in this product. The sodium content PER SERVING (scoop) is 260-300mg. That in itself is too much, but when combined with the low potassium content per serving the sodium content becomes unhealthy and dangerous in the long term. The high sodium content (and low potassium content) causes fluid buildup on the outside of the cells and you may end up with cramps while lifting and pressure on your heart. BSN could easily fix this by substituting potassium bicarbonate for sodium bicarbonate and potassium compounds for sodium compounds. Many people ignorantly complain about magnesium content which is not a problem for this product (too much sodium WILL send you to the toilet). This product has a serious potassium/sodium imbalance and is not healthful as such."
3,NO-EXPLODE = NO GOOD,I've been using this for about 3 weeks but I guess I don't really feel a whole lot of an impact. Yes it gives you energy but after I was done working out and the caffinee wore off I got a headache. Didn't feel any huge pumps or anything besides lots of NRG
4,Website control!,I have found this to be a great tool for modifying my website and giving me full control over the content. Its very easy to install and use although I'm still learning some more of the finer details. This product works great with an existing website and I would recommend web designers who work with Dreamweaver to tell their clients about it so they can give them full access to the content of the site without altering the design. I am certainly having fun with it! [...].
1,Don't Buy Contribute CS3,"===DON'T BUY CONTRIBUTE CS3===The Contribute CS3 version has a TON of bugs and does not work correctly with Server Side Javascript nor does it work correctly with interactive Flash Menus.When I contacted Adobe to Swap the licence for the new CS3 for the older 4.0 version, they said 'NO' and that they where AWARE of the bugs but would not offer a solution at this time.If you try to purchase any older version software, Adobe will NOT sell you older software nor will they support any older versions of Macromedia Software.DON'T BUY ANY NEW ADOBE VERSION SOFTWARE!They don't know what the hell there doing over there. At least Macromedia supported ALL of there software and allowed you to purchase older versions of software.ADOBE SUCKS!"
5,My daughter loves it.,My daughter asked for this book and I got it for her for Christmas. She loves it. She has already read it once and says she is about to read it again.
3,Not as good as I thought!!!,This mouse looks sleek and works great when the cable is connected!!! I didnt spend all that money for a CORDED mouse!!!.. When the cords are removed...the range is very bad...They advertise 6FT range...what I really get is less than 6 inches range!!! I even got this exchanged for another one and even the new one is bad. I'd go for another brand of cordless mouse. This one's just not worth the money!!
4,Neat concept,"I bought this at an art museum store. Very neat.Pros: unique photo presentation, cheapCons: takes up much space, arms are a little fragile (insert into ball gingerly or you'll bend them), should have 1 more arm for hole in bottom of ballAll in all, I'm pleased. I printed out 32 photos, each of which was in equal size to 1 other, & then I taped the matching-sized photos back-to-back so that it holds twice the photos & there are no blank photo backs as you look around it & spin it."
5,A great game if you are a PVE Player,"This game is mainly PVE (Player vs Environment), and it is a lot of fun, the graphics are by far the best out there in the MMO Market. Questing is actually fun, and makes you feel like you are part of the story line. Leveling is at a nice steady pace.Over all this game is a great MMO, and the player base seem to be more on the mature side when compared to other MMOs out there."
3,"Game great, don't buy special edition","I downloaded the game on line, it is great, and different from WoW. I bought the Special Edition box only because I wanted the ""Cloth Map"" stated in the description. It does not have a cloth map. Just download the file and start playing tomorrow (it's a big file)."
1,help,"Actually I would have rated it 0 star if there was a 0. because I cant get it to run. I have not used it yet. I am not great on the computer but I installed it and no go. I have to wait till my son who is a genious to come over and help me. It may be a great game, it looks like a great game. After buying it I hope I will be able to play it some day. I am not happy :-(."
1,blank110,"Ordered the JAVA battery which has a 16 hr use time. This is not what I received, I received the Cheaper priced standard spyder battery that has a 6hr use time. was disappointed me but did not call & complain I needed the battery the weekend I received it & needed to use it.The Picture very miss leading call & insure that you are getting the correct product ordered. there is a difference in the batteries"
1,"If you have a CF62T phone, don't order this battery.","The label on this battery states it is for use on the Siemens CF62T cell phone. Don't believe it! This battery won't fit into that phone. It is too long, too narrow and the terminal is in the wrong location. Spend a little more and get the right battery somewhere else."
2,Check what the Ship You,"Although the battery ships in a container that looks professional and represent the model number I purchased, what is inside (just like we're always told) is what matters. The product, upon arrival, is not what I purchased, (and paid more to match the battery I was replacing)- it was a common 600 instead of 750mhz model, and as such isn't at all what I wanted. The downside of a free internet, though I feel secure using Amazon, is that this type of huckstering is hard to, and usually not worth the effort to get buyers rights. I do not wish to see the vendor who sold me this, but I would love to get the respect I deserve as a consumer, which is sadly lacking."
3,NEEDS WORK,"While I used this entire book with an adult group, I was somewhat disappointed with the content after the first chapter. The language seems to be lifted from other works, leaving sentences awkward and sometimes strangely worded. I also thought the questions of the Q&A format were transparent and lacked challenge. I would have preferred to have more theological scholarship included in this rich topic. The author clearly comes from an Evangelical and not an Anglican standpoint in creating the lessons which sometimes feels narrow and judgmental in scope. I probably will not buy another volume of this series."
4,Beatitudes - Stott,Currently using this book in a mens bible study. All participants seem to enjoy the book and find it helpful in studying the Beatitudes. It poses thoughtful questions and provides good references to scripture.
2,An Okay book,"This book was okay, but overall a disappointment. Perhaps it's my own fault. For me the definitive in southern fiction is To Kill a Mockingbird. This book couldn't compare. The story had a great deal of potential, but would have been better if the narrative was richer and the character development stronger."
4,Good but gets to be long,This book starts out good but then after the first hunderd pages it gets boring. There is not much of a point.
5,A SIMPLY WONDERFUL BOOK,"I was able to read a pre-publishing copy of this book recently. It is a simply wonderful book. It is similar to ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee. I believe Ms. Devoto is a first time author. She seems to be very insightful. I would recommend this book to every age, male or female. My husband enjoyed it as much as I did. It reminded be so much of my childhood in many ways and took me down memory lane."
2,Just so-so,"I was disappointed, maybe because all the reviews I read were so effusive in their praise and I was expecting too much. Still, I found the girls a bit too precious; their friendship contrived; some characters (especially the twins and the father) to be so undeveloped as to be irrelevant; and just a general lack of pizzazz. The comparisons to To Kill A Mockingbird are wrong; this book does not come close. My opinion is obviously in the minority, bubt I just don't think this book is all that good."
3,A fun read,A cute story but did not really grab me and make me want to keep reading. Very light and fun. Great vacation or weekend reading.
5,"A smooth reading, funny yet informative book.","I have been studying the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone for some time, yet this book not only gave me tons of new information it also made the information palatable by bringing with it humor and wit. Mr McNamee has an insiders view, being both a rancher and a wolf lover. Few people could see through both seta of eyes as clearly as he does, yet he makes it seem so easy. If you are to pick one book about the wolves of Yellowstone to teach you as much as possible I recommend this book to you. I do feel like he rushes details at the end of the book, but since the saga is not over, the book was hard to finish I suppose. Other than that small detail this is a great book with lots of facts and easy, witty, reading. Enjoy"
5,Straight from the hip truths about wolf reintroduction,"I first read this book from a library, but I so wanted to make margin notes and highlight sections that I bought my own copy. McNamee pulls no punches, relating incidents and portraying personalities central to the saga of the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park. Among the very best of the books about this historic episode in the annals of conservation."
3,"Decent French Rap, however there IS much BETTER","These are French Rappers. If you are not familiar with the world wide affection for American Hip-Hop, this is a direct product of it. Rapping in French can be good, this however, is not that good. If you want to get good French Rap, look under Premiere Classe or Pit Baccardi (these ARE the premiere french rapppers, a large grouping over 20+ rappers including Neg Marrons, popular in England). This thing: decent, but ehh...Premiere Classe is a much more lyrically advanced and sing about more ""hardcore things"" then meeting new people. For Spanish rap: ORISHAS."
1,"Amazon, I'm returning it!","I wish someone had written a review on this ""Activity Pack"" before I bought it. This is a disappointment and I can't believe that it costs $9.95 at regular price. The pack has a 10 page brochure on Renoir with beautiful pictures by the painter and very few words at all. You can do better if you just go to the Library and check out a book on Renoir. Anybody can just copy a Master's paintings and make the pages of a book look beautiful. As far as the activity notebook, it is worthless. Don't buy this book! Unfortunately I bought two of these books, Renoir and Monet. I'm returning both at my own cost. I gave this one star because there is no option for none."
5,Wonderful introduction to art,"I love this series of art books by Mila Boutan. They are colorful, informative, and written in a manner that is easy for children to understand. The accompanying activities are also fun and creative, allowing children a hands-on experience to coordinate with that artist's particular work. Although my no means a comprehensive overview of the artist, it is a wonderful, approachable way to introduce children to the world of fine art."
2,Reads Like A Grammar School Book,Not the best book written about Tahiti - This book is part of a series from the same publisher on destination around the world. Very vague content. Would be good for younger school children for research about the region. Sorry :(
1,not happy with this product,I purchased this items twice and it was defective. The first time the cobalt blue pots were broken during shipment. The second time when I assembled the unit and place the water pump in the water (submerged accordingly) the pump fell apart and could not be reassembled. The pottery was beautiful. I do think the fountain was overpriced for its size and durability.
4,solar fountain,It's a great fountain and a wonderful addition to my garden. I just wished it had a battery to store some of the solar power so when it gets cloudy it keeps running.
1,This other reviewer must have a finacial stake,"Keith Emerson is my #1 influence! This album is a scam! Two songs from Keith (which I remember nothing about)! Six other poorly recorded, terrible new age songs from nobodies. Somebody wants your money! (It came out 20 years ago, I don't know where they dug it up.) I'd give it no stars but they won't let me."
4,"Nice, but... Who plays it ?",I'd listen half of the songs and is without doubt a nice album.Other reviewers complains that only 2 themes were composed by our beloved keyboardist; but no one said if he's the performer of the others. Could anyone clear up this confusion?
3,Runs small,"Basically a good wetsuit. However, I was disappointed that it didn't have a pouch for a key. And the main thing problem was that it is smaller than a normal XX-Large."
1,Way too tight around the neck.,"I am 5 feet 4 inches and 115 pounds. I bought the small size. It fits perfectly, except it is way too tight around the neck. If I zip up the zipper, my face turns red. Even with the zipper half zipped up, it is too tight around the neck. It is unusable."
2,Doesn't keep you warm at all,I got this so I could swim laps in our new pool (In Florida) during the winter months. We have a solar heater but the water stays between 65 and 72 from Nov-March. It felt just as cold with this wet suit on then without so whats the point?
2,Has one *major* flaw,"This could have been a nice wetsuit:- the material is decent, not too stiff and not too ""sticky"".- it is relatively light and flexible- I like the white stitching - looks ""different""It has one fatal flaw - first, the upper portion around shoulders is relatively small (I usually am OK with L, but tried both L and XL and they were kinda tight up above, and I am not all that wide in the shoulders).Worse yet, and that's a complete deal breaker - the neck opening is *tiny*. It is literally sized for a 6 y/o child (I checked). Unless you are a true ""pencilneck"" there is absolutely no way you'll be able to zip it up and wear it without choking.Too bad."
4,Sizes run very small,"I am approx 5'11""-6' and 180#. I usually wear 34waist X 32leg sized blue jeans. I also wear normal mens Medium size shirts. I have never in my life had to buy an X large or larger size...... Until now. I got my wet suit today in X Large size. It is very tight around chest/shoulders and neck. So back it goes and hopefully the XX Large will be perfect. This suit is thin as described. I do wish it had knee/elbow pads integrated. However, it does seem to be of decent quality for a $89 wetsuit."
2,Way too small,Before buying this item I checked the size chart carefully and made my selection. When the item arrived I tried it on and couldnt even get it on enough to get my arms in. The size on the item said it was the right size but it was way too small.
5,great for jet skiing!!!!,Used the wetsuit today at 59F. on the lake jet skiing and loved the suit. Keeps me warm for hours.great item.!!!!
4,Sizing Issue,"First let me say that the suit seemed that it would be very comfortable, if I could have put it on. I am 6'00"" and 215lbs. Based on other customer reviews and the sizing chart I ordered the XX-Large. The distance between crotch to shoulder was way too short. Had to return. Suit is made in China."
3,Nice Suit - Runs a size Small,"Decent suit, runs about 1 size too small. Luckily it fit my brother.I would order the size larger than what the chart says."
4,Size Issues,"Another great product, but watch the size issue.I am 5 feet 10 inches tall, 220 lbs and the xx (double x) was too small.I do not believe there is any size larger available.Overall it is a great product, but you can easily see it runs very, very SMALL!!!"
5,Love it,Keeps me warm in 52 deg. water for over 1/2 hour. Could not swim in Puget sound with out this. I am 6'4 and it is just a bit short but not bad.
4,Good quality suit,"As mentioned by others, go one size up. I have the M/Lg shorty version, but had to get the Lg for this full suit (6'1, 160lbs, slim frame). Neck area is very snug. Keeps me comfortable for a few hours in cool/cold waters; I spearfish and windsurf in the Azores. For the price, it's a great suit and I recommend it for fishing and other activities."
5,Works for me!,"I rode to Portland, Oregon this week. About Hood River it rained big time. First drops I put my suit on over my leathers and I didn't even have to take my boots off first. I was warm and dry the last 80 miles to Portland. I did order a size larger and it fit perfectly. NICE PRODUCT."
3,Sturdy,Arrived when it was supposed to. Item was as advertised. Very plain yet the build feels like it will last. Robust grip.
1,piece of sh*t,"All right to start the shipping was good, the gun was fine when it came. I cocked it back(not loaded)and shot it nothing happend. I went outside to test shoot it(loaded) and all the bbs loaded into the gun and jammed it. It shot blanks, so I took off the slide and it broke in half, then I tried to get the last three bbs out and the whole gun broke in half. So I dont recommend this gun to any one and the mag was super cheesy. Dont buy it or u will waste your money."
4,Pretty good gun,"I ordered this gun and i loved it. it shoots pretty far, it shot further than my m16. My brother shot me from about 30 feet away and it left an instant bruise on my arm. But sadly after having it for about a month i cocked the gun and then dropped it. i picked it back up and the trigger was not working properly. So i pushed the metal thing on the back forward forcefully (which was a bad idea) and it snapped forward. Now it wouldn't cock so i used the quick open thing to open it and see what the problem was. I found out that a metal piece inside had snapped in half. This gun was very good but it broke because of my stupidity. If i would have opened it right away i probably could've fixed it. So i would say that if you want a gun that you can have fun with than you should buy this. If you like to have lots of airsoft wars i would say you could manage to use this gun in one but it would be advisable (not sure if i used that right) to get something a little bit better."
4,Excellent Value,"For 1 cent, this gun was certainly well worth the buy. I bought 2 when i got an airsoft colt 45, so i did not have to worry about the high shipping. It arrived quick and the guns are a little heavy for the size, but amazingly accurate. Overall if you are looking for a modest airsoft gun for an amazing value, this is your gun. I recommend adding this item to your cart when you are purchasing something else such as a holiday gift, so than you are not paying extra for the shipping, than its really only 2 pennies for 2 airsoft guns and that my friends is a bargain!!"
1,junk toys - do not buy,"This product came in a pack of seven. Unfortunately, four were defective. My son wanted these, and although they were cheap, frankly, they were cheap."
2,Disgustingly Fragile Internals,"I ordered around a total of 5 of these guns and they all broke internally on a lifespan from 1 day to 3 days each. The external is fairly sturdy. Its weak, and is meant to be a children's toy. The slide has a lot of resistance. The externals lasts for quite a while, but the internals. In each of my 5 P99's. All of them were internally broken.Conclusion:Fun to play with. Recommended for chlidren. Its cheap, except the shipping on Amazon is monstrous for such a weak gun. Its very fragile on the inside and bound to break in a couple of days. Iron sights are useless as this gun has a very low range and catastrophically low accuracy."
2,pretty much bad,yes! this gun is bad like most of the reviews you seenthe good part is that its safe for kids and doesnt hurtthe bad part is it can break in a hour or so try this at your own risk! this is worth 1penny but not S&H; i recommend you buy 20 of em so they last longer
1,CRAP!,piece of crap i will never buy a bb gun online again!!it was a joke a pure joke! it was all plastic and my kids watergun worked better
2,Decent pistol with some problems,"I don't know what brand it is, for it has no labels or insignias on the gun or the box. It's not the version shown in the picture. Mine is the standard M9, beretta style with no finger grooves in the grip. It's a somewhat heavy pistol with plastic body and a metal hammer, clip and release pin. It was obviously used, although i chose a new one on amazon. It had scratches on the magazine and gun, and a ton of houshold oil in it. Probably there because it jams all the time. It seems to not jam so much with polished bbs, don't expect much from the free bbs they come with. The spring inside the clip buckles also, that might be part of the reason it jams. But it seems to shoot ok most of the time with good bbs. You are much better off to buy an airsoft pistol, for about the same price, from a website that specializes in airsoft."
3,eh,It was an okay gun but after three days it broke. the thing that broke was the part of it that cocked the gun. but it was a okay gun for a penny.
3,Not so Great,"Looks cool, breaks easilly. Shipping sucks. Small. I would suggest spray painting them silver, it looks coller."
1,Broke Immediately,"Purchased for a Halloween costume. It broke after a 3 or 4 shots. The slide mechanism broke in half. They sent me a replacement without me having to return the original which was nice, however that one broke after only a single shot.Great if you want a prop gun. Terrible if you want a functional airsoft gun."
2,an ok gun,I bought this gun n early september. The gun worked fine for a few weeks and then it jammed. I fixed the jam a few times but the cheaply made plastic cracked. For the price it is an okay gun.
4,Great gun for 16$,"i got this gun 2 days b4 the time it was estimated to be sent (i got feb, 8th the est. time is feb, 10th-feb 16th)while ive had this gun ive noticed the pros and cons.PROS-Heavy duty feelworking hammereasy to cockcons-The mags spring is all bendy and stuff and the bbs double up kind of so i shoot 2 at a timeno safety (i couldnt find 1)and no box or anything....mine was in a styrophome box....and no instructions either(dont need any though) but it would be nice if they had some"
2,You get what you pay for,"My son is 10 and wanted these mini airsoft guns... since they are not the ""regular"" airsoft guns which are not really safe for kids, we ordered these. He thought they were great but quickly broke one. A few days later, the other one was broken as well. These are NOT quality toys. HOWEVER, my son insists they are great and has the pistols to pretend with even if they no longer function. I have decided these are good little novelty items for a birthday party or a gag gift for adults. And, if you order several, the shipping costs are more reasonable."
1,Junk,"It only cost a penny, and yet it's still a rip off. Do yourself a favor, put the penny in a donation jar and save the shipping."
1,Gun really sucks some!,"This gun MAJORLY sucks!! I got it, and it barley comes out of the barrel. After about 10 shots, the gun broke on the inside. When i took out the magazine when i heard the noise, a few plastic pieces came out. The shipping is rediculous!! I went to the flea market and bought 2 guns for $5!! And they were new, and a whole lot better. They hurt a lot more than this crap, and its 2 for $5!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GUN! They overpriced it! Its worth LESS than a penny!Not even a noob should buy this! It breaks within 5 minutes, it jams, and it breaks itself. Go to walmart or the flea market and get a better gun for the same price, if not less!!!"
2,Broken after 2 days - purchases through Amazon,"Shipping and packaging was excellent. Was fun while it lasted, but broke on day 2. This was my 10 year old sons first airsoft gun. I don't believe it broke from misuse whereas he's used them before at neighbors' houses. You can here the pellets inside the gun and the trigger is jammed. This was very inexpensive so I'm not shocked that its broken. But my son bought this with money he earned doing extra chores, so for him it was devastating."
2,an ok toy for little kids,this gun jams 92% of the time and for it not to jam you have to cock it fast. and it has a very low fps it has about 70 fps and i was sent the wrong color gun. so this gun is not worth the money
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Product broke within days, looks allright but feels flisy from the get go. Pellets dont hurt at all either, they shoot at maybe 1 mph..terrible waste of money"
1,"Stay away from this vender ""Hot Toys""","I purchased this gun for my son for his b-day, and the first thing that I noticed was that they sent a different model gun then ordered. Next,after playing with it for less then one hour something inside the gun broke. I called the company about 30 times before I actually got someone on the line. The rep sent me a link to apply for a Return Number, received it, packaged the gun and sent it back. That was almost two weeks ago and have called the company now countless times with no answer or just a busy signal..Also no return message to my email. Since the cost of gun and shipping was about $15 plus another $7 to send it back, I would have been better off to just go to WalMart. Hope this helps someone out there who is about to make the same mistake."
1,CCCCCRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPP,I bought this gun and when it finaly came i played with it for 10 minuts and then a little plastic flew off and hit me in the eye!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GUN. REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GUN.
2,Not The Best Gun,When i got the gun i took it outside to shoot it and it went about 2 or 3 yards. It is still a good gun for 00.01!!!!!
4,cheap gun,Reading the reviews here I really though it was going to be a complete piece of crap... maybe it is compared with actual good bb guns but hey it costs 1cent + shipping...I think it's good. I use it to shoot friends in the ummm a place where it's not going to hurt them much when they piss me off : ) nice little sting they feel
1,do not buy,"when i first got it, it was awesome but it was my first one so i cant say it is the best.two days later(just right now) the stupid thing breaks when i was just about to relieve some stress onto some bottles. this thing is a p.o.s. DO NOT BUY !! you will regret it"
2,plain junk,"okay first of all i am an experienced airsofter and this is junk if you want a good gun save your money and get a better one than this,it is fairly accurate but all plastic junk and brakes very easily. dont get this gun"
1,Horriable,The mag will suck all of the bb's up if you u put more then one bb in the mag and they will get stuck in this gun!
3,Fun but not great,this pistol is a fun toy to play with. i bought four of them and they are fun to play around with but really suck.
1,HORRIBLE,"when i firrst had gotten them they were broke.1st gun the trigger was broke , there were allready pellets jamed in the gun so when i opened the clip lots of them fell out. there was a crack on the side of the gun. then when i fired it the hole top of the gun came off . The safe lock was broke . 2nd gun split on the top ,when i shot it , 3 pellets rolled out the barrel and landed on the floor. when i took out the clip a whole bunch of pellets fell out the gun . this product should nt be gettin sold"
1,terrible..dont buy this gun,"this gun broke a day after i got it, cheapest gun ive seen...3 bbs got stuck inside and i tapped it a a couple times in my hand and the whole top came off..the plastic sucks and the screws are tiny"
1,don't buy,I would tell anyone not to spend their money on this.Broke the first day we had it defiantly not worth it.
4,Pain to reload,Its cool but it is a huge pain to reload all the time with only one clip but overall it is pretty good
4,ok...,"I got my m9 and it was pretty cool! Awesome for kids or beginners, but definently for pros, which is good. It is pretty big, and has a great capacity!Pros: Awesome feel to it, medium weight, looks cool.Cons:may squeak like mine, safety mech. not obvious or visible, and might smell wierd."
1,WEAK PRODUCT!,"this is a cheaply made gun, i was actually stupid enough to buy two, the first one broke when i dropped it. the cheap metal broke of the grip damaging the trigger mechanism making the gun inoperable. the second was broken in the mail. do not buy!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"I would not spend two dollars on this toy. If it was less than two dollars (which it was when I bought it) then, ""what the heck?"" It works I guess. It shoots the bb about 15-25 feet, inaccurately because there is no hop whatsoever. It is accurate to about 10 feet. If you buy this, it should only be used indoors with a sticky-pad target. Mine worked for about Four weeks of little to no use, and then the clip would not stay in. I held the clip in with my finger while shooting for aroud an hour after that, and then it stopped shooting. It was amusing to blow it to pieces with my gas sniper-rifle though (Tanaka M700 AICS)!! I would not buy this gun again."
1,Pretty Junky,My son was really dissappointed in this gun. It broke in a few minutes. Plastic body came apart in his hands. They make it seem metal in the picture but it's not. The better option would be to just go with a slightly more expensive gun to get the quality desired.
1,sucks,it broke apart as soon as i used it i dint understand y tho its cheap by quality and price smh
3,"It's ok, but only buy if your patient!","Gun itself it's alright. Shoots nicely for like 15-20 feet then strays. Do not useBB's provided. They will damage your gun. Buy .12 or .2 BB's on amazon, it will shoot MUCH better. I waited 10 days for shipping! That is ridiculous! They said 3-5 days and I was not informed of a delay! I used free shipping on a different item and that came faster. So don't buy unless you have time."
1,UK arms is bad and they should feel bad.,I haven't bought this gun yet but for $45 I got a package of 5 guns in which 2 similar guns came with. All but 1 of my UK arms guns broke. Don't buy.
4,dang look at that gun,this gun looks like a begginers first gun but this gun really is fun for all the people in the family to just play around and shoot.1. you don't have to be good to use this weapon2. always keep more ammo on you this gun will run out fast3. treat gun with care if you want it long4. not the best idea but u can let little kids play with it it so small5. enjoy the game I know i will
4,Pretty good!,Pretty great for the price! It was 6 bucks! Wotks good if you just wanna shoot around! You should buy!
1,bad shipping,I ordered the M9 pistol it has been 12 days and I still don't have it. It did have free shipping but free shipping takes 2 to 8 days to get to your house but it's more than that now. I would not ever recommend that you buy this item from this vendor unless you want it to take a very long time.
2,wow...,but it is very fast. The firing velocity is roughly estimate between 50-100 FPS. That is the truth. This gun jams occasionaly but is very durable for some reason.
3,don't be stupid,"Dont buy it and think ""OH WOW a cheap gun"" at best its only for annoying your brother/sister/cat/dog. not for actually using in a war/CQB/ anything that has to be accurate. Ive had water pisotols that shot faster..BUTremember the price. it's not a $40 gun, dont expect $40 gun performance"
2,This gun is junk.,"This thing is tiny. When fired, the pellet goes about eight feet, dropping to the floor almost as fast as it travels forward. It could serve as a .25 auto replica if the trigger could fit even small fingers. If you glued it together better it would be OK for a small child that you don't want to cause much damage. She may tell you size doesn't count, but if you pull this thing out expect some laughter."
3,I GUESS IT'S WORTH IT,"I just got 2 of these guns today and i went outside to use it. It went about 10-15 feet at most but didn't go much farther. I than went in to eat and then went out a second time this time after about 1 clip the trigger broke on the one.I guess for a cent each it's worth it and + i might be able to return it. So before buying remember that you get what you pay for.I did return it & they did send another very quickly, but that one broke too. Good seller, not so good product!"
2,A GOOD START TO AIRSOFT,"My 10 year old son's friends all have airsoft and he wanted his own ""piece"". I figure I better buy cheap until I know how long he is going to be interested.So I bought a couple of these.The clips are hard to load and missfire often. sometimes the bb's just roll out the barrel and sometimes they are hard to cock. When they do fire, they are pretty whimpy.Nice Piece for show"
1,lol..?,"I just recently bought this gun (by accident, stupid 1 click button) and i cant believe this gun is actually being sold. The BB's given to you arent even the box shown on the picture (false advertisement?) and the idea HotImportToys to even describe this gun fire power as VERY FAST is ridiculous the damn gun cant even shoot past 3-5 feet (watch out u better run!!) they wouldnt even cancel my order when it was placed by accident (why would they? they know this gun sucks and they gotta make money right?) anyway good luck on those lame reviews and have fun with this stupid gun. AH DEE DEE DEE"
2,Expert review,This gun is a VERY BAD GUN!!!!! If you are from the ages of 6-10 i would get it but if not dont. I got 2 of these the first 1 broke rit away and the other only shoots 15 feet. trust me this gun is a piece of junk. Just poket to shipping and buy something else!!!
1,P99 mini,If you play in a skirmish don't use this as a side arm not evn for begeners. It shoots about 5-10 feet and it looks like its lobbing it out of the barrel oh i for got it's so small it barley has a barrel. This gun is a little kids toy why1.if your a teen or adult you hafe to use your pinkey to pull the trigger.2.its listed in toys and the toddler stuff sectionPlese don't waste your money on this gun!!!!!!!!PS. each gun will be $7.00 after shipping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"""Piece Of Crap''","THE GUN IS A ""PIECE OF CRAP"" WHEN YOU COCK IT ALL THE BBS GO UP INTO THE GUN AND AFTER LIKE THREE SHOTS THE GUN STOPS WORKING."
1,I hate it,Because this gun it doesn't work and the bbs stuck in side I don't know why if u can't please me come and I will show the video
2,broke,the gun kept splitting apart every time tried to shoot it. even gluing it did not help it out when shooting
3,ok i guess,It is fun for my son and I to shoot at targets but I noticed that the ammo compartment had a bad spring so I replaced it and putWD40 on and it is great now but for others you may not like is
1,Don't waste your time,"I got this gun thinking it would be awesome and all but guess what???On the first day, within the first hour, I pull it back to cock it and all of asudden I have a broken gun. I strongly reccomed not getting this."
4,Is it functional?,"The gun looks and feels super cool. It're more of a matte plastic than how the picture shows. It came with some airsoft bullets. I bought this for a costume, and have no idea how to actually use it, so I don't know if it's functional. For a costume gun, it's a really great value."
2,Cheap,I got this on time and at first seemed like a decent gun but after playing with it a piece of plastic near the trigger fell right off. I'd say spent the couple extra bucks and buy something better
1,"world's best team, world's cheapest video","This expensive game video comes with no extras, passive commentary from a couple of bored guys with no interesting insights, and poor video quality. The only saving grace is the quality of the game itself, struggling to matter in the face of such indifference."
3,"Jacky Jasper is on The cover, Not Keith..","I agree it would be better if Keith was on the majority of the album, but that is why this is Jacky jasper...if you want a CD strictly keith, than buy one of the several out there(2 new cd's released April 06')Keep it UP!!"
4,Keep My Sh*t Clean is a solid album,"Recently everyone has been attempting to classify rap into smaller categories. Terminology like ""Trip Hop"" is thrown around frequently. However, Keep My Sh*t Clean goes beyond any geeky sub-genre. Innitialy, the disc seemed average. After a few days, Jacky J's album, which originally sounded unpleasent, hit me with quality lyrics and sick beats. Jacky Jasper may never attain wide acclaim, but to his credit, Keep My Sh*t Clean is too extreme for today's mainstream. Both Dr. Dooom and Spankmaster feature Jacky Jasper, so I was curious to see how he'd sound on a non-Kool Keith track. Jack Jasper kicks some sick flows, mang... Anyhow, this is a good, unique disc."
3,Many flaws but still an ok album,"Jacky Jasper has appeared on Dr. Dooom, Analog Brothers, and Spankmaster before releasing his debut album. It's not a bad album by any means, but it's not what I expected. I've been wanting to hear a Jacky Jasper solo since I first heard him on ""Call The Cops(Dr. Dooom AKA Kool Keith)"", I copped this and I was dissapointed(""Porn Star"" has to be one of the worst songs ever recorded in hip hop). Chino XL, Esham, Marc Live, Kool Keith, Roger Troutman(RIP), and Ice-T are featured on this album.Best song-We Showed UpWorst Song-Porn Star"
1,Roots reggae fans AVOID,"UB40 is known for their cheesy attempt (is it really an attempt?) to play reggae music. For real hardcore reggae fans, this is a waste of your time and money. If you want syrupy sweet watered down psuedo reggae, then this is who your looking for."
3,"Bathtime, Rex!","I love UB40 because they present so many listening options. When you actually want to listen to MUSIC, heaven forbid, you can play some of the early stuff - 'Signing Off' and 'Present Arms' being the albums to check out (they are poorly represented on Vol. 1 and not represented on Vol. 2). When you're washing the dishes or giving the dog a bath, then you can let the great bulk of UB40's recorded output wash gently over and around, but not of course, through, you. It's all very pleasant and the essential similarity of the polite, saccahrine-sweet covers they specialise in has a cumulative effect: you and Rex will both be gently bobbing your heads by the time you towel him off. Alarmingly, some worrying signs of Songwriting are beginning to creep back into UB40's muzak: particularly 'Higher Ground' from the Promises & Lies album, and 'Bring Me Your Cup', a song so downright sensuous that Rex is likely to do very strange things to your leg unless you're careful. Woof woof!"
3,Volume One vs. Volume 1,"I purchased Volume One within the past month. This CD has only 10 tracks on it, whereas Volume 1 has 18 as mentioned in an earlier review. So if you are buying this...I recommend you verify what you're looking for!"
3,"A good collection, but...","This is a good collection, but I'd buy ""The Very Best of UB40 1980-2000"" instead. It has almost all these tracks and more. The only songs missing from ""The Very Best..."" are ""Breakfast In Bed"" and ""Please Don't Make Me Cry"". The latter is a great song, but I wouldn't buy this cd for just one track. (It is also included in ""Labour of Love"")"
4,Truck part really fun,Truck is great. I was excited about the part where you could put sand and rotate the axe but it gets stuck really easily once you put sand in it. The 2 pieces are now independent buckets we use fir other purposes. Sturdy and safe.
3,Best for Sand,"I was actually looking for more water toys, so my review isn't necessarily pertinent. It doesn't work so hot as a water toy, but I'm sure would be better on the beach. ""Sturdy enough"" - like most toys these days."
3,"Not bad, not great","I got this because I really wanted to get a bucket, shovels and a dump truck all at once and that is a big plus for this product. But, my daughter has never really used the sandmill - it isn't very effective... meaning the sand doesn't come out very easily. Also, I have a bit of an issue with the storage in that the pieces won't go into the bucket once everything is put together. Just make sure that you don't need a ""self-storing"" group of toys and otherwise it is fun. Also, very strong plastic and durable."
2,Looks like more fun than it really is!,Sadly this toy looked awesome online but the reality was a disapointment. The little wheel falls off and is frustrating. May be better to buy pail shovel and truck. Not worth the money paid for it.
4,Nice Camera!,I really like this camera. It takes great pictures. It easy to use when out kayaking. It has fallen in the water and been entirely submerged with no problems. It's sporty looking and very easy to use. I highly recommend it.
5,BEST DIGITAL CAMERA I'VE EVER OWNED,"I have had one for over 10 yrs and saw this one online. I love it for its simplicity and it takes excellent pics! Though no tele-photo or the extras one purchase with other cameras. But if one know how to use software, that is not an issue."
3,loved it until it just stopped working,"as a long time film user, this was my first digital cam. I'm fairly active, and since purchased in Aug 03, have taken it sea and whitewater kayaking, into the break, sailing, sledding, skiing, etc. While the resolution wasn't up to what I was used to with even fast film, I took pictures where I just wouldn't have been able to before. I took care of the o ring, and have experienced none of the problems reported by other reports here.All was good w/ it until it just died last month. I'm probably going to check out some other alternatives, and am not even going to bother calling sony or the place where I bought it.Even with that said, the camera's just about paid for itself in the past year."
3,I loved the story but I especially enjoyed the illustrations,"Nova's Ark is a wonderful futuristic tale of robots and their intergalactic world. Author David Kirk ingenuously takes a little piece of our world and blends it with theirs. Nova is a young robot who has a strong desire to follow in his father's footsteps in space exploration. He possesses a crude wooden ark that contains a menagerie of wooden animals. It was a gift that had been in Nova's family for thousands of generations. This ark and its animals play an important role in Nova's survival when he unexpectedly gets his wish to travel in space. This is a story that would appeal to readers of all ages. Also, everyone is sure to enjoy the bright, colorful illustrations. Never have robots been depicted with such unique yet sensitive personalities."
4,Great pictures but...,"Got this for my 5 year old grandson who loves robots. The images are outstanding, but the vocabulary and text are geared for older children, not 5 or 6 year olds. I've read it a couple of times, but he prefers to just look at the pictures. It's too bad, because with some good editing, this would be a 5+ star book."
3,"Good concept, could have more material","I like the idea of this book very much, it has well thought out topic and well organized content. There are not so many books teaching how to play complex multi-pieces endings and this book fills this niche very well.There could be a bit more examples, many important concepts are illustrated just by one or two games, moreover not all illustrative games match the subject they illustrate perfectly. More short examples (from real games or especially prepared, I do not bother) would make this book better.Minor but very irritating feature of Aagaard books (present both here and in Excelling at Chess Calculation) is repeatable themeof criticizing or applauding other chessbook authors. Those notes add no value to the book, interrupt the thread of reasoning and just eat the valuable space."
5,beautiful,"now this I can give 5 stars too.This flag is beautiful,thead count is high, colors are bold. Great quality. And flaglines customer service is a joy to work with. recomended highly."
1,Would not recommend as a facial moisturizer,"I got this to use as a night time moisturizer for my face. It smells awful, is really greasy, and caused my face to burn and turn red. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,It is fine,It seems to be fine. I like that it was in Lego form. As for the taste I don't know as it was a gift (joke) for someone
2,too hard!!,"I liked the look of the candy, and how you could use them like real legos, but the candy is way too hard!!! I haven't yet given any to my kids because I don't want to end up with a visit to the dentist with a broken tooth!!"
2,Halo Firm HOld Hair Spray,HELMET HEAD!!! WAY WAY TOO HEAVY BUT IT WAS THE ONLY HALO PRODUCT I COULD FIND ONLINE. I am sad Halo is no longer produced.
2,Beware,The lowest price is not always the best! I purchased this hairspray after using this for the past 5 years until it was discontinued. When I found the website listing it for $8.88 I jumped at the chance and ordered 5. How disappointing. The container did not look like my original Halo bottles and the product did not live up to my standards. I feel it is a fake or a knock off of the brand. Now I know that the lowest price is not the best option when comparing!
3,"Good stuff, but too few tracks","The only disappointing thing about this CD is that it has four less tracks than the ""[import]"" version also available from Amazon.com. Otherwise, this album has the most popular tracks of the band of recent times with ""Kingston Town"" being the central track. The tracks are fun, rhythmic, and light. Get it.If you're new to UB40, expect 80's and 90's reggae-like pop. In other words, it's reggae that has been ""adjusted"" towards the tastes of those of us who enjoy pop, and perhaps hold no particular interest in ""true"" reggae. This is a good place to begin, but also check out ""Volume One""."
2,So-So,"It's a good dryer for someone washing their dog at home or for small dogs with short to medium coats (not poms or shelties), but even the high setting is not very powerful. Would not recommend for serious groomers, and would not pay more than $50-$60 for this dryer."
5,Amazing Work on A Very Interesting Topic,"I read this book (and cited much of it) for my undergraduate thesis, and I must tell you, this book was wonderful! Very few people have ever put as much time, thought, and research into the process of translation as it relates to J.R.R. Tolkien and his Lord of the Rings book.The author takes what many may consider a dry topic and brings it to life--I know that I was enthralled for weeks. It is simply astounding the beauty of Tolkien's language choices and the effort and forethought that went into it and the translation thereof.For anyone who loves Tolkien, loves translation theory, or better yet both: this is a must read! You will walk away with a new appreciation for how much work translation is and yet how important it is."
3,decent read,"A feel good, positive vibe type book. I took a few valuable pieces from it and incorporated it into my daily life."
5,all he says exists,"I have been liviing in the osa, costa rica for almost 5 years now & this book is dead-on accurate. Great reading, Dominic Tantarelli, osa, costa rica"
5,The original Science of Stripping!,"This book is AMAZING! I literally couldn't put it down. It reminded me so much ofThe Science of Stripping by Darren Michaels, the way the main characters both talked and pursued their goals in a hilarious way. I highly recommend both of them."
4,Experience behind the theory,"Gives a great overview of the history of wind power, and a practical guide, backed up with decades of experience that any novice can understand. Great book for anyone who is new to small wind that wants to get involved or install their own system."
4,Mom loves it.,Bought this for my Mom for Christmas and she loves it. She had specifically asked for this type of stool. Glad I got it.
4,Good for the price,This stool was exactly as described. It was sturdy and serves the purpose for which it was purchased. The unpadded back is an issue when sat on but easily remedied.
3,White chair/step stool,Don't have a review yet. Missing the left leg part. Looks like it might be great once it is assembled.
2,Cosco step stool,I had one of these many years ago and loved it. THe new one is just as good. Most convenient step stool I was able to find.
2,Ms.,"I purchased this chair/step stool for the purpose of having a stool in the kitchen with a back on it so we could sit at the counter and work more comfortably. I thought this would be a good one since it could double as a step ladder. It's only good for a step stool as far as I'm concerned since the back is extremely uncomfortable. I've tried putting a pillow behind me and it still isn't comfortable. I feel like I wasted my money because I really needed something with a functional back. If I had to do it over again, I would not purchase this stool."
1,Impossible to Assemble!,"This Step Stool came with two identical legs rather than a right and left leg, making it impossible to assemble. Two attempts to contact the Cosco Company went unanswered. Since the package was opened, I cannot return it."
1,Don't buy this Junk Chair,"This brand name use to represent quality, now to sad to say this chair is junk. High priced junk at that. Metal parts do not line up for assembly, when finally you do get is assembled it's legs are so uneven it is not usable. If it was worth the time and effort I would try to disassemble it and return it, which I have no doubt Amazon would let me do as they are very good about returns. However it is a horrible piece of junk and too hard to send back. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
3,Read Description Carefully,"I thought I had ordered a product I remembered from my youth. I was mistaken. This model has an extra step and does not fold as I expected. It's still an effective step stool, so it serves its purpose. It was not so easy to assemble and it still rocks a bit. I cannot figure out how to fix that issue."
4,Just what Mom wanted!,"My mom wanted this so she could sit down in the kitchen while working. She had one many years ago, so she knew just what she wanted. She put it together herself (and she's 85). She said it was a little bit of a challenge. Anyway, she loves it!"
1,disappointed,I recently purchased this step stool thinking I would get the same quality that I have been used to with Cosco products in past years. I am very disappointed in the quality of this stool. It is most uncomfortable for sitting and the vinyl is paper thin and tears very easily. The standards of this once well respected company have certainly hit rock bottom.
1,Its not what your grandmother use to have,"Cheap aluminium, no nuts, just bolts with tiny sheet metal washers which go through the metal. I accidently grabbed a longer screw and with my own pressure, screwed completely through and poked a hole on the leg. The middle step is too small, so the top is leaned in to much. The seat slides side to side, not very safe. And the back leans to far forward.I will find a true, full steel, with nuts, bolts, and washers, like how my grandmothers and mom's is. This one I will just turn into the stuff animal stand."
3,disappointed,This item came unassembled and when putting it together found that one large screw was missing which entailed running to the hardware store to purchase one.This is not acceptable. But then again it was not made in the USA.
3,Great & Wonderful - NOT,"Bought this chair/step stool as a replacement for my mother-in-law's worn out one. The picture and description indicated it was very close, even better looking than the old one (when it was new). It was easy to assemble and looked just like the picture; however it is much lighter weight than expected and most importantly it isn't level--it wobbles, and I can't get it to streighten out."
5,just what I expected,"I have been very pleased with this step stool/chair in my small kitchen. Our children are petite, our counters are high, and this stool/chair combo is saving my sanity. When our elementary/middle school aged kids put away dishes or retrieve them, it's very easy and safe to do so. At 5'5"" I cannot get into our higher cupboards easily without this. I like that there are 2 step levels, and if you're fairly agile they will be fine. If you have balance issues, it may not feel as safe, though the back of the chair gives something to hold onto.I've not had space for a chair in the kitchen, but this little combo fits in a corner by the door fine. It is not designed for large people to sit on, but for children or an average-sized female it's fine (holds 160 lbs. just fine). Tonight my dh was working on something and I actually could sit down comfortably and talk with him in the kitchen.At this price, the quality is very good."
4,This step/chair is very good,"When I found this Chair/Step I was very pleased because I had been looking for something like this for a long time. I'm happy that Cosco has re-issued their original chairs. Its too bad they could not find an American manufacturer. Putting the chair together was a bit of a challenge but now that all of that is done, I am happy with it; it is steady and quite useful."
4,Cosco Chair/Step Stool,I like the chair/stepstool very much. It works as I had hoped. I would have given it 5 stars but it was a bit of a pain to put together.
5,Great book for kids to answer their own questions,"When my sister and I received (I think all 5 books) in this series, we explored a vast array of information, browsing subjects at random. These books explain things in an interesting, brief manner that doesn't talk down to kids, but encourages associative learning and thinking. It is a crime that they are out of print. If you find copies, grab them!"
4,BOWIE REGAINS HIS FORM,"As the 80s closed out - it seemed that Bowie wanted to erase the slate of his musical (mis)adventures - the Glass Spiders, the Never Let Me Down, Tonight, Labryinth, etc - and return to his reinventive roots - before it was too late. And here it was with Tin Machine - almost on the mark, and worth 4 Stars for the effort. If anything, it proved that Bowie did still have the balls in him to do something potent. As the reviewer from Chicago, Illinois points out - the album is a little long, teetering on excess - but tracks like ""Under the God"" and ""Heaven's in Here"" vindicate that. Reeves Gabrels is a great guitarist, and belongs in Bowie's hall of fame of guitarists. Gabrels brings something to the party - chaotic Jimi-Hendrix and Robert Fripp tinged licks. And the accompaniment by the Sales brothers is suitably spartan. Not for every Bowie fan probably but for those who want to sneek a peek at what he was doing around this time."
3,Undeservingly Maligned,"Just about any Bowie fan or rock critic will cite the Tin Machine excursions as the worst recordings in Bowie's diverse calatogue. To those indiviudals, I ask them to listen to Bowie's first album or ""Tonight"", which are by far worst. Although Tin Machine might not be in the same league as the glam rock standars on ""Hunky Dory"" or ""Ziggy Stardust"" or the experimentals musings of ""Low"" and ""Heroes"", this is an album that still deserves to be listened to occasionally. The album is not as ground-breaking, but still predates alot of the noise-rock that would come to dominate alternative radio in the 90's. I still listen to Tin Machine from time to time, and still find it enjoyable. Although not a classic, it is still woth a spin."
3,Take me anywhere.,"Tin Machine was a hard rock band fronted by David Bowie, with Reeves Gabrels and Hunt & Tony Sales. Bowie and the band wrote all songs, other than a cover version of John Lennon's ""Working Class Hero"". It's a decent album, although Bowie's voice is buried in the mix. I hate to sound like an old fogey, but I like Bowie's early stuff better."
4,Bowie got his balls back II,"wow, this release is fun. It rocks, but has no fancy strung out stories in the lyrics like the classics did. This is just good strieght forward rock. Not what fans of old want to hear, but that doesn't make it bad."
2,Cheap product,We bought this product under the assumption that it was nicer than some of the others and the one we have. It is not!! It is a very cheap net and the poles came broken and one of the raquets is freying and it has never been used. The seller is very hard to get a hold of and will only return with a re-stocking fee!! Very poor company in my opinon. Not worth it!!
4,A Little Clarification,"These study books of McGee's were originally written as notes and outlines for the thursday night Bible studies at the Church of the Open Door during the 50s and 60s (this is not the same procedure which was done during the 5-year program in the 70s). They were never meant to be exaustive. After the series were completed, these notes and outlines were made into book form. This is explained, almost apologetically, in the forwards to these volumes. They are meant to be used as a companion to the audio studies which are still available from TTB. I find these studies much more informative than the 5-year program which, for time constraints, are almost rushed. This is understandable, considering that the program is only 5 years long."
2,could've been better,"A decent enough overview of the case's history, but poorly written and cripplingly biased. It's ironic that an account of a case which relied so heavily upon the facts (or distortion of the facts) is itself so careless with actual events and their motivations. While there is little doubt of Carter's innocence, the story of his case deserves an objective telling, which ""the Canadians"" (as the authors refer to themselves) do not provide. And would any American actually refer to slang as ""black english""? If you're interested in the history of Carter's case, check it out, but skip the overwrought dramatic interludes and take everything with a grain of salt."
5,Very Solid Sharp Book,I Was Like Lazarus I Couldn't put this Book down.I Find This Book to be Very Moving.it captures so many Injustices.it shows how little value was placed on one Man.No Matter who he was or how much Money he made he was still a Black Man.Guilty Sight on Seen.this Book also shows the Loving&Caring way of the Canadians.it's amazing what reading can do for ones mind or the Journey it will take you on.this book is about Freedom.The Canadians Freed Lazarus&the Canadians together with Lazarus Helped free Rubin Carter.the Importance of Reading.if Lazarus had have never read that Book a Great Injustice would have never been solved.
1,"""Close Minded"" Liberal Authors.....","The close minded ""bleeding heart"" liberals who wrote this book do a terrible disservice to the story of Rubin Carter. If I believed all that the ""Canadians"" have to say about the American Criminal Justice system I would have to think that every person in prison is as innocent as a new born baby and that they are being treated like a pig at the slaughterhouse. I have never been so upset with the authors of a book that was supposed to be a factual account of the criminal justice system. I could almost hear the ""Canadians"" patting themselves on the backs for the great work they did to help free the ""Hurricane"". Skip this book and watch the movie or read the books by Mr. Carter himself. The ""Canadians"" have zero crediblity."
3,canadians are brainwashers,"This book is good for getting more info than radio or magazien articles or the movie can/has (time constratints). However, I would suggest checking out he new bio of Hurricane for he real deal on the smarmy canadians who can't write: it gets worse. After Hurricane was freed from jail he was imprisoned again, at least mentally, by them."
2,Far Too Many Errors In the Examples,There are far too many errors in the examples. I spent so much time fixing the errors that I easily lost track of the principle I was trying to learn.The book also makes frequent reference to on line help. I spent $31.99 to have convient paper access to the information that I needed.
1,See the Hardcover,"The book did not show anything of value. I was very disappointed when I read it. (Which took all but five minutes.) I would recommend the full size copy of this book, but the small one wasn't worth it."
3,Tina Tourin Produces A Whole Bouquet of Harp Tunes,"White Rose features a whole bouquet of lovely harp tunes. The majority of which have Rose in their title. Especially pleasing was Tourin's adaptiation of ""The Rose"" of Bette Midler fame. Less familiar but very lovely is the tune ""Fynbo"" A genuine unexpected bonus was Kim Robertson""s many appearances on this CD. This CD lasts longer than live flowers and would make a great gift for the harp lover in your life."
5,The Raven's Knot (Tales From The Wyrd Museum),"This book was enthralling and to one new to Robin Jarvis, the quality of his writing is astounding, this book is a must for anyone who enjoys something a little quirky, I loved it almost as much as his series ""The Deptford Mice"". I have not yet read the first book and i am currently looking for it because of the excellent quality. Robin Jarvis is such an acomplished author that i feel that anything that he has written is automatically worth reading. The plot and sub-plots are clear, and the characters and ideas used are enough to draw you in immediately. Definately the kind of book I just coun't put down for more than a minute. I recomend this book and hope that many people out there will consider buying it."
5,Best New Author for Fantasy Novels,"After reading this book, I was totally hooked and could not put it down. Rarely am I able to read a book so quickly, but this one was a real string puller and I had to finish it. The fight scenes were so good I felt like I was there. The plot was deep enough that I could not figure it out right away, but later on it all made sense. The characters are believable and you feel as if you are part of the story.This is one book I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to get into fantasy novels or just wants a good book to read. I can not wait for his next novel to come out, and I will definitely be getting that one. Some day soon he will be as big an author as Salvatore or Jordan with a series of books to his name."
5,Bringing new life to the realms!!!,"Ghostwalker has everything you could want in a book, action scenes that are so clear that you could imagine them on the big screen, love and heartbreak, and a character that you instantly become facinated with and would never become tired of reading about.This book is equally great for people who love Forgotten Realms or even those who have never read any of the other books that take place in the realms!!!The first excalmation point is for the scar on Walker's arm, that came from the thin man's sword. The second is for the scars on his chest, that came from the barbarian's gyrspike. And the third for the scar on his shoulder, from the woodsman's axe.Erik Scott de Bie has risen to the level of the best writers in the realms: R.A. Salvatore, Paul S. Kemp, Elaine Cunningham, and Troy Denning."
2,Misprinted book,"I tried 2 copies of this book. Both were missing the pages following page 282. They had been replaced with about 40 pages of another book (""The Silent Blade"" by R.A. Salvatore). The book probably would have been 3.5 stars if I had been able to read the ending instead of having to guess."
2,Well written but limited,First of all I can say that I am a great admirer of Matt Ridgeway. The book is overall exceptional well written but lacks the personal sense that Carlo D'Este put into Patton: Genius for War. It seemed that the author has a title for each chapter then expanded this based on topic. A chronological order to Ridgeway's history would have made the book more substantial.
5,"This volume is the best...all 12"" versions!!!",Don't know why the CD inserts don't mention this as a MAJOR selling point of this volume of the series. Track times:1. bad girls (4:55)2. stir it up (7:11)3. bridge over troubled water (10:15)4. Saturday (6:05)5. hold tight (5:24)6. this time baby (7:12)7. you used to hold me so tight (5:37)8. new dress (5:09)9. flirt (5:47)10. you're puttin a rush on me (8:30)11. don't you want me (6:50)
5,"Truly a book for ""A Must Read List","This book is a ""Must Read"" for retired Law Enforcement Officers,active Law Enforcement Officers, and also those that are interested in True Police Stories. This book gives the reader a clear look into actual cases and situations within the Honolulu Police Department. The book was written by David Heaukulani who is a skilled writer and a former Assistant Police Chief of the Honolulu Police Department. Very good reading and hard to put down."
1,Disappointing...,"I grew up in Hawaii, and I was really looking forward to reading this text. Maybe it's because I'm not a police officer, but I found the language structure so flawed that I kept asking myself, who edited this book? Unfortunately for me, the writing style (or lack of) took away from the stories."
4,Light-hearted and Funny,"Although often mistakenly connected with Yaoi or Shonen-ai by Amazon, the manga is actually funny short stories about daily life at Cafe Kichijouji based upon a hit drama CD in Japan. The five cute guys who work there all have different personalities, from the girl-crazy ""romeo"" floor waiter Maki Okubo to the spooky chef Minagawa who carries around voodoo straw dolls with him.Highlights include the story when Minagawa takes two days off and asks the others to do the cooking and when the poor college student part timer Shuta Tokumi visits the other worker's apartments in search of free items.Wacky, light-hearted and fun, this Manga is designed to make you laugh - which is suceeds alot! Great script and very attractive artwork. As the book is published by Digital Manga is comes in a slighly larger size than normal with an attractive glossy dust cover and cute removeable board game. Very refreshing!"
5,It's The Bark!,"Great fabric and vivid colors make onesie first rate. Further, the material is well sewn. I am totally delighted with this item and recommend it to others."
1,Reminisce Through The Decades - The 1940s,I bought this for my parents who were in their 20s in the 1940s. It didn't hold their interest at all. I watched a little of it and thought it was totally boring. Just photos with someone talking about the decade. Just not what I expected at all. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2,Rather disappointing purchase from Amazon,"Very short on detail or narrative. My mother for whom I purchased this, usually loves old pictures and events on DVD's but this failed to hold her interest."
3,Problem with 3rd CD,This was a birthday present for my mother. She loved the 1st and 2nd CDs but the third will not play. Nothing happens.
5,A powerful analysis of Mary's relation to issues of gender.,"This is an amazing book. I assign it to my Sociology of Religion classes. It is a powerful, critical look at Mary. Hamington takes us through the social construction of Mary and exposes the ways in which her image has affected our own understandings of gender and sexuality. It is scholarly and yet accessible. Hamington looks at the patriarchal underpinnings of Mary's image and how this image has been used against women over the centuries, stigmatizing their natural sexuality and mothering capabilities. Read this book! Assign it to your students! It is the best on the subject!"
2,Less then I expected,It was clear I did not see the index close enough to see AS2 is used. Was looking for a book on integrating Flash AS3 and .NET. Search everywhere on the web looking for information. Everyone says you can use ASP but have no examples of HOWTO as I like to see actual coding. Only had this book for 2 days and all the information is old school.
2,ASP.NET for Flash,I thought this book will discuss all issues and will have a richASP.NET solution for flash but it goes less than what I needsure its cool as it names on but it doesn't cover what am lookingfor from this title.
2,To electronic for my liking,this soundtrack just didn't feel like a bond one. tina turners track is very good as is the second but overall it just didn't have the right feel. not enough use of the bond theme either. it is a different soundtrack from what they have done before so there will be some who like it for that. but i like the big orchestral pieces and this soundtrack does lack them. give it a listen though and see what you think.
2,Worth Buying-Maybe,"Most of this track is techno-crap, however, the Goldeneye song by Tina Turner is worth buying the whole album. 'Ladies First' is also a favorite, as well as the goldeneye theme (not Turner's song, silly! No. 2!) 'A Pleasent Drive in St. Petersburg is the worst crud I've heard in my life. Thank God they had the sense to take it out of the movie. At least some of those people are smart!"
1,What was this guy thinking ?,"This soundtrack is the main flaw on an otherwise great 007 flick. I've read Eric Serra felt the original 007 theme was outdated and whatever part of it was played in the movie was forced by the producers (and conducted by someone else). When you have one of the best recognized and most beloved themes associated with a movie character and decide to drop it, you should start looking for a new career !At any rate, Tina Turner's song is a very aceptable entry into the Bond legion of songs."
1,Beware of mediocre composers...,"...especially when they are given icons to play with. Such was the case with composer Eric Serra and ""Goldeneye"". I hadn't been this disgusted with a soundtrack since Leonard Rosenman's travesty for ""Star Trek IV"" -- Next to no use of the classic Bond theme, hokey synth solos which suck the life out of every scene they appear in, one track (""A Pleasant Drive in St. Petersburg"") which was so bad that it was left out of the film...and oh yeah -- Serra's delusional belief that he can sing any better than he writes (""The Experience of Love""). Thankfully, this was Serra's first and last opportunity to soil the Bond icon. David Arnold was handed the reigns for the next two pictures and helped erase the painful memories of this score from hell (In all fairness, I should mention that Serra's next score, ""The Fifth Element"", was far better.)."
5,A Bond Of A Score.,"Note: This review is for the Expanded Score of the film.The score for ""Goldeneye"" is every bit as thrilling as the movie itself. Eric Serra does a magnificent job of bringing James Bond to the 90's crowd, yet manages to retain Bond's roots firmly. Very well done."
3,A techno 007,"While not what I expect from a Bond film, Eric Serra has done a good job with his score to ""GoldenEye."" While much of it is electronica and techno, the beats occasionally work for the film. As a CD by itself without the visuals, I find the same quality a little lacking. Serra's music is obviously meant to accompany visuals, and while successfully reminding me of the images from the film, it fails to bring them to life. This score, however, suffers from a serious, and oft-mentioned, flaw. While the music is very good action music, Serra's limited use of the traditional James Bond theme is a let-down. As the first Bond film in almost a decade, the score should recall classic moments from Connery and Moore. Instead, it gives us a new hero, a hero who is missing a subtle yet identifying link to his past. So while I think this is an excellent movie score, I do not think that it belongs with a James Bond film."
1,Don`t waste your money!,The two good tunes on this album are the title-song and The GoldenEye-Overture.Otherwise auuuuuuuuuuuggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!
1,I enjoy tecno but this is worst 007 soundtrack of the 18,"The track is an insult to Bond. Not only is it not in the same class as Barry but it is a huge bore. Thank goodness EON has the smarts to bring back Arnold who did a fantastic job mixing Barry's classic punchy bondian brass with the new tecno of the mid/late Ninetees. His ""Tommorrow"" is the best 007 score since ""The Living Daylights"". I like Tecno but this Serra track is Junk. If you like Tecno try ""Virtuosity"". If you love Bond then try any thing from ""From Russia with Love"" to ""O.H.M.S.S."" or even ""Octopussy"" or ""View to A Kill"". What were EON thinking when the brought in Serra? Hopefully Arnold can repeat his worthy effort on ""The World is Not Enough""."
1,"Except for Tina's song, it's techno-electro-wriddled crap",Thank goodness the Bond Production crew had the sense to go back to a full orchestra in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. The synthesized garbage that Serra spewed throughout this movie and soundtrack CD is nothing short of blasphemy. Tina Turner's opening number is the ONLY thing worth listening to on this abortion.
1,P-O-S,"Worst CD I own! I hardy listen to it. I take this ""score"" out only to hear tracks 1, 8, and 9(that is - if I ever take it out). It was apparently not performed by an orchestra- but by synthesizer. It doesn't say anything in the CD credits about an orchestra. It only says Music performed by Eric Serra. The 1 star comes from the best song on the CD- track 9, which is the only track that that sonuds anything close to a real score.As of now I don't trust any of Eric Serra's scores. If I wanted garbage, I'd go down to the dumpster. I have to say that if Serra were to do do a score with orchestra, I might look into it. I am just getting tired of the repititous sounds of what sounds like gravel in a can, or maybe it's just a screw that's loose in Serra's head.I recommend this score to anyone who wants a new hobby - collecting dust."
1,"No no no, save your money","It's absolutly a mystery how the Producers ever let this pass.If you want to listen to real Bond music, listen to John Barry's scores instead."
1,Double-oh-zero stars,"What a pity I'm forced to give this License to Hurl 1 star, because that's one more than it deserves. Synth maven Serra was a terrible choice for this genre from the beginning, being far more comfortable with a futuristic feast like ""The Fifth Element,"" but then he arrogantly doffed the Bond theme and peppered the film with hokey, inappropriate synth solos that dragged down every scene they accompanied. One (""Pleasant Drive in St Petersburg"") was so bad that the producers omitted it from the film, leaving the scene it was meant for to flounder on without help.Of all Bond scores, this one would be a finalist for the worst ever, along with Legrand's jazzed-up mess for ""Never Say Never Again"" and Hamlisch's disco-drenched ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" Decide for yourself which one was the worst, but this one is definitely a bottom-three puker."
4,This cd makes me want to see the movie over and over and...,"This cd soundtrack is a credit to cappitalism, this is truly what soundtracks were made for! The Goldeneye soundtrack includes the spine-chilling and romantic full orchestrated music that definitely stirs your heart and soul...REALLY! The Severnaya suite and main title song with the Run Shoot and Jump song bring together the harshness of Russia experienced in the movie into a whole new light! If you loved the movie then get this great companion to add to your goldeneye collection for those lonely nights when you need a lift. And while your at it...get the game too..."
4,GOLDENEYE - UNFAIRLY MALIGNED,"GoldenEye, by Eric Serra, has its low points, but many high points, so for it is not a total loss. After watching GoldenEye the movie once, I immediately want to get the soundtrack. Why? Because Serra manage to compose some very distinctive pieces for the film: THe GOldenEye Overture, Ladies First, We Share the Same Passion, Severnaya suite, Dish OUt Of Water, Run Shoot and Jump.There are duds of course, but then again, not every soundtrack is perfect. As far as I am concerned, those who gave this soundtrack a low rating ignore the best parts of about it...which outnumbers the negative parts.And the title song is one of the worst ever written. After a five to six year absence, we Bond fans deserves something better than THAT! It is lyrically clumsy, like they are trying to jam too many words into it all at once. Awful.Aside from that, musically, it is more interesting than any of David Arnold's Bond works."
2,Anyone actually listen to Ace of Base's Theme Song version?,"It fits the opening them much better than Tina Turner's own. In fact, Tina Turner's song doesn't even make sense, if you think about it. Hopefully, someday, there is an option to at least hear the theme song with the Ace of Base version on disc, either with them or someone else reproducing it. It makes so much more sense."
2,Could have been a lot better!,"The whole soundtrack seemed gloomy and only of one style. There are a few things it had that I liked better than any other Bond music, but not very much at all. Eric Serra's track was very good, but did not have the style of Bond. I was disappointed that there was not very much of the original Bond Theme performed by John Barry."
3,Review,This is a great score by Eric Serra i have seen better CD's but also i have seen worse to. It is a better CD than what David Arnold did for the next film. I don't want to center out David Arnold i loved what he did with ID4. Eric uses diffrent tones in the music i have never heard before. I like it when composers do that kind of stuff..
2,A Techno Bond Score That Is Almost Good,"The ""score"" for Goldeneye is a weak one. Mainly arranged of synthetic music. Hardly the orchestra enters the CD.The song by Tina Turner is the best opening title of a Bond film. The second track is alright to a extent. The third track is the worst on the CD. But there is a lighter side of this album. There is a good piano solo on the 8th track. Thats about one of a few best track on this CD.The score also includes some very odd compositions. Like the sounding of sleigh bells, the cracking of the whip, haunting male choruses, and what seems like a group of people clapping.Frankly the score for this movie would seem alot enjoyable if it used a full orchestra."
4,small and serious,"As already mentioned, these are small, but they are very well made. They take and hold a very good edge and are perfect for detail work. Very easy to control."
3,"NICE TOOL SET, BUT EXPENSIVE","I bought this set mainly for the gouges, for carving designs onto gourds. The cutting edges on all the tools felt rough and so, before I could even use them, I had to order a sharpener (DMT WAV-F Diamond Wave Fine Sharpener). Even though I would have eventually needed to purchase the sharpener anyway, I expected such an expensive set of tools to arrive razor sharp, which is the reason I gave them only three stars instead of five. However, they are a nice set of tools, and I really like the leather pouch."
5,West Tennessee Taproot Review,"West Tennessee Taproot is a sensitive, thoughtful look at the author's heritage. As a southerner, I could relate to this book. The loving tributes Mr. Britt gives to his family are very moving. An interesting read!"
1,This DVD is not for American DVD Players,"Not sure what format this is, but it simply doesn't work. I tried exchanging it for another copy of the same DVD and had the same problem. I tried it on 2 different DVD players in my house and it still doesn't work. This is not your standard DVD format so be cautious when purchasing."
3,A DnD game,As a gamer and a person who playes DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) i was happy to know that this was DnD related. Even though its not the best game it still has a good tactical sense. It has the whol D20 sense in it. The MOD is pretty good. On in all its a fairly good game and any DnD player would enjoy it.
3,eh,don't get me wrong i love these games but they all say they are xp compatable and 2 out of 4 are not. even though they say it right on the disc.....
3,Auto-Install Function Works for 2 out of 4,"Just like the others on here, I had problems with the Auto-Install function on 2 out of the 4 games. Luckily, I was able to install the other 2 through my control panel-add programs. They worked just perfect after adding them the long way. I love Nancy Drew and this set is a great price for your money, just be aware for XP you may have to do some work to initially add them."
4,It was REALLY good...But,"When I played them, the first one I wanted to play was ""Secrets can kill"" because I was told that was the easiest one. When I tryed to install it it said it would not install. So I took a look at the manual CD. and it said that I had to install ""Tresure in the tower"" so I installed that but STILL it woul not let me install ""Stay Tuned for Danger"" or ""Secets Can Kill"". Next I tryed to install ""The Final Scene"" (because that was one other that I HAD to install first. But it still, even to this day won't let me install the two that won't work. So,now, I've lost the two that don't work.:(Beware. it says it will take windows XP but I don't think it does. Sorry."
2,Nancy Drew Should Solve the Mystery of Software Glitches,"Might have been a better experience if the game had allowed me to save, didn't freeze up or the video display worked consistently. The puzzles were not outrageously difficuly. It's hard to be objective about the story line and puzzle content when I experienced so many software glitches playing the game."
3,HAD TO REBUY,ok so i bought ths game pack and 2 of the games wouldnt download because the discs were blank had to send back for refund. which amazon did with no problems and i just reordered it so ill update this when it comes in and find out if all 4 games work.ok so i realized that theres nothing wrong with the game it wont work because its an older game and 2 of the games wont work on windows 7.
1,Not the best,Not the best stories in the Nancy Drew series. Hopefully future releases will be better.
1,Nancy Drew: PC Games Kill!!!,"I bought this pack about a month ago and had to send it back because it would freeze up and it would not advance any further in the game. I was stumped so i check a Nancy Drew Help Website. It said that you had to receive a note that would tell you to go to the boiler room. I NEVER RECEIVED THIS NOTE!!!! I could not go any further in the game because of this issue. Also, when i was talking to someone in the game it would just freeze up.SO my recommendation:DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME PACK!!!"
3,OK product - took a long time to get it to work on my new laptop and not-so-new pc.,Had to google search to find a way to install the disks - they are outdated.Also the graphics weren't the best.
2,I don't recommend this!,This game would be more fun if it would have let me install them! It only let me install Secrets can kill. I would not recommend this.
4,I can't believe no one has reviewed this title!,"This book precedes Faber debut novel (Under the Skin) and shares with it a certian love of the bizzare. Numerous surprise endings, grotesque plots, and strange ""goings on"" abound. If you liked Under the Skin, you'll appreciate these stories too."
4,Very good short stories,"Very interesting and different plots and characters. Superbly written. It always had my interest. From the author of ""The Crimson Petal and the White"""
4,No frills--just right.,"It's difficult to find an address book that isn't loaded with kitschy imagery or banal quotes: the Typography Address Book is lovely in its simplicity, especially for those who appreciate graphic design. Inside are found eighteen entry-spaces for most letter sub-headings, with plenty of room for two street addresses; phone, fax, and cell numbers; and e-mail addresses. For those of us who'd like a personal reference book that doesn't look like an unwelcome present from a great-aunt, Chronicle Books has published a gem."
2,Address book,Very cute address book but the binding keeps seperating from the pages......leaving me with a big mess.
4,Does the job,"No one has come out with the perfect address book for me yet, one that would have a space to write in the entry's relationship to the owner of the address book and would have a back pocket for stamps. That said, this is a nice medium sized address book, the spine is about 1 1/2 inches wide and covers an interior wire spiral on which the pages flip. The cover is cardboard faced with vellum. This is very minimally illustrated with letters of the alphabet in a variety of interesting fonts. The cover color is not quite a deep cherry hue as it appears on this web page, more just plain red. The spine is black. There are about 12 entry spaces per alphabet letter, 3 to a page."
4,another great one from these guys,"i just got it and its really good. the only reason i didnt give it five stars is because it has some songs that were on older cds (and i liked those versions better), and it rarely went into this rap metal thing, which i cant stand. but theyre unbelievable and original, everyone should check them out."
5,"Wow, futurock is here!","This second full-length album by Gruvis Malt is by far the best CD I've heard in awhile. This album blends elements of jazz, rock, and rap; and they do blend together, as this mix feels cohesive and never too forced. The stop (red light?) and start (green light?) elements are jawdropping at times, and go well with the overall theme of the album (the traffic light cover is apt in this respect). This one is miles ahead of Sound Soldiers: while SS had great grooves, the tracks were not carried out to their full potential. GM is clearly beginning to challenge the parameters of ""popular"" music.Words cannot do this music justice, so I recommend you visit www.gruvismalt.com and listen for yourself."
2,with the spirit of a confused band,"""...Traffic Jam"" is a mixed affair. First of all, re-recording the gems from the ""Backout Smiling EP"" was a very questionable move at best. ""Low Concept,"" ""Even the Scars..., and ""Aggression then Silence"" have not been improved upon, but arguably ruined. On Low Concept, the band sounds as if it recorded the song while falling asleep. In fact, I found the raw energy of these songs virtually non-existent in this recording. There are highlights, including the gorgeous ""Mr. Prince,"" and ""Destination"" is a fun listen, as is ""Filling in a City."" I'm afraid that the band became too obsessed with production tricks this time out, going so far as to virtually copy the beats that Matmos created for Bjork on ""Stop and Go..."" These are talented musicians. Nobody can deny that, but ""Traffic Jam"" seems to be an attempt at finding a voice rather than a solid album that demands play after play. And, for God's sake, if something isn't broke..."
3,Not the brothers' best...,"I am a huge fan of the Cazimero Brothers, and bought this album based on their concerts and other recordings. However, the quality and selections on this album are uneven and disappointing. Only a few numbers met my expectations."
2,Pet Shop Boys - Megamix,Too expensive! Keep repeating the same songs with boring mixes. Only die hard fans would buy it.
2,Good book about the Rom (if you're a DeLint fan),"Charles DeLint's 1985 novel, Mulengro, is worth reading for one of two reasons: it allows a DeLint fan to compare his older writings to his current works and it offers a (somewhat simplified) insight into the contemporary life of ""gypsies"" in North America. Unfortunately, the book also suffers from a villain-driven plot (an all-too-common device of DeLint's), too many characters to allow full or almost any character development, blatant manipulation of emotions (having a man ripped apart by rabid dogs in front of his wife and child reminded me of Corman at his worst)and, finally, there were far too many trite expressions. When a reader compares this work to DeLint's three brilliant short story selections or two of his latest works such as ""Trader"" or ""Someplace to Be Flying"" he or she can be confident that the author has certainly honed his craft since the last decade."
1,"Nice idea, but not a good consumer product","It's a nice idea, but unless you've really got to play divx videos today, you're better off waiting.The current software (2.7.1) has many many bugs. It's easy to crash the box, and the user interface has enough terrible qualities that it's really not usable as a consumer device.The display continuously proclaims ""state of the art dvd and ethernet player"", and evidently it will continue to advertise this long after it is ""state of the art"". It's a really annoying ad to continuously scroll across my livingroom, so I leave the device powered-off most of the time.There are a couple of chat boards on the internet about this device. One maintains a list of current bugs that is quite long and inexcusable for a consumer device. Read the latest before purchasing.On the bright side, the firmware is reasonably easy to upgrade and they seem to do new releases fairly often. With good software, this could be a nice device."
2,Not the best product,"I bought this filter wrench hoping for an easy way to remove oil filters. The adjustment slips easily, and the wrench does not easily or tightly grip filters."
1,Careful,"I purchased this to change the oil on my lawn mower.It has two holes to adjust the size, but if you adjust to the smaller size it slips right back to the bigger size as soon as you try to use it.Don't purchase this product to change small filters."
5,great product,"so far its worked just as its supposed to, able to plug in network cables and coaxial cables which is great. the spaced transformers are also great and helpful"
4,Flo does know,"Hearing Florence Ballard sing without Diana Ross' interference makes this disc worth buying. The song may not have been a number one but it is a catchy tune and enjoyable to listen to. This hard to find track is a must have for any Supremes' fan.Madeline Bell's original version of ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"" is a terrfic song...the Supremes and the Temptations cover version made it all the way to number two on the Billboard charts.Gladys..Dusty..Betty and Freda's voices on these obscure songs sound sound rich and full.""I Say A Little Prayer For You"" by Ms Warwick is of course a solid hit."
2,"Nice diagrams, very weak on explanation","The diagrams are certainly nice and probably a good reference for the moderately experienced bass player. I tried to use this book when I first picked up the bass and found it to be very lacking in explanation. It jumps right into all of the modes and how to play them on the fretboard (the nice diagrams), but there is little to tell you in the first 2/3 of the book how it all ties together. The practice charts are pretty good as well, but overall not the best book for a beginner."
4,A rush for the bomb,"The title comes from the players: Israel, Egypt, and Russia. Israel hijacks a ship loaded with uranium in hopes of building a bomb before the Egyptians. The Egyptians try to stop the mastermind of the plot. The Russians also have their own interests in trying to stop Israel.The novel is an adventure on both land and the high seas. It stays on course for the most part though does have a few twists. I was looking for a better finale. The fight scenes and each individual's abilities may be a bit of a stretch nonetheless, it was an interesting read.LORD BlessScott"
4,Impossible Adventure,"Although entertaining, not nearly at the same level as ""Pillars of the Earth"" or ""World Without End"".Takes what seems like a very long time to set up the plot and create the characters.After that's accomplished, the real action begins. Or, let's delete the word ""real"".The feats the hero accomplishes are so totally impossible, that not even the most powerful super heros would attempt.Wow, can anyone really do that? The answer is ""no"". I like action narratives, but this is just beyond belief.Should have been a comic book!"
5,great read - thank you,"Thank you so much, I loved reading the book; Follett's books are always interesting and character driven and are full of action."
3,"Triple, an entertainig novel.","To me, this is middle range spies' book. The plot is more or less credible. The characters are quite well described. This author likes to include in his novels sex passages (with a commercial aim, I believe). All in all, you can enjoy this novel provided you do not look for something outstanding."
2,Not the real Follett,"Readers acquainted with the mature Follett will certainly miss his usual geo-political even-handedness here. Besides, the episode of the seizing of a small ship carriyng uranium by an israeli commando is based on a physical impossibility: the vessel is at anchor at large, in the middle of the Mediterranean. Come on, only oil rigs can lay anchor in high seas..."
3,Decent Book,This book was a decent book but i felt that how almost all the characters in the book knew each other was a little to coincidental.Also some parts of the books seemed rushed as if he was saving pages. I guess this could also be taken for fast moving depending on how you want to look at it.For a real good fast paced exciting book i would look to Vince Flynn and his reocurring character Mitch Rapp.
2,Follett at his least interesting,"Ken Follteet has written one more ""barn-burner"" that is really a ""pot-boiler"". Don't get me wrong, This author has turned out some really great fiction; unfortunately, this is NOT one of them."
2,Good Read,Liked the book but it was a typical Ken Follett style. Fast paced but not much depth. Good read but felt like it could have been more.
3,Fairly Enjoyable,"Fairly Enjoyable; however, the plot was slow and predictable in places. It is not what I expect from Mr. Follett who I rank near the top--in the company of my favorites: Grisham, Baldacci, and W.E.B Griffin. Still I enjoyed it and glad to have gotten it on my Kindle (at a Kindle price, of course)."
4,Tripple,"Book starts off slow, but you soon recognize Follett's mastery. As the plot develops the suspense becomes familiar to someone like me who has read every single one of Ken's books that is available on Kendle."
2,ok - not great,"Follett is a favorite of mine - but this didn't ""grab"" me like most of his other books. There are some great characters in Triple, and an interesting premise - it just didn't come together (for me)."
4,Triple by Ken Follett,"Ken Follett takes the reader back to the days before fast information was available online. Back to the days of when Isreal was a new nation and the problems she faced with her neighbors. A spy story that will keep you reading into the night. Dickstein, from the Mossad, Col. Rustov, KGB, Cortone, Mafia from the USA. Suz, a young and beautiful woman of mixed heritage. Hassan an secret agaent from Cario, working with the KGB, but is this his only employer? Across Europe, England, into the United States and Italy. On the high seas to the middle east. Ken Follett's book will keep you reading. It is loaded with intrigue from start to finish. Learn how agents can get people to co-operate without knowing it. Then, as we think it is all going to go under, the plan by Dickstein seems to be working even though people have died to accomplish his task. What is it that Dickstein was trying so desperate to accomplish? Follett will surprise you with the ending. Another Follett thriller....DP"
3,triple,Good story on how spies operate in the cold war. Not very realistic in the end. Too many people killed and hero succeeds against all odds.
4,terrific read,love the historical knowledge gained from follet's research my interest was held fom page 1 to the end it.s a winner
3,Hard to follow,I have read every Ken Follet book and enjoyed them all but found this quite heavy going with so many characters I had trouble keeping up. Certainly not his best work
2,This one disapointed me,"I'm a fan of Ken Follet, but this book is not even close to his best ones. I don't recommend it."
2,Dull Read,The story is quite dull and predictable. It is clearly an early book and not as well written as later novels. Between 2 to 3 stars.
2,Not his best,Not his best...too many changes in venues without connecting the characters to the base of the theme. I like this author & will read his other features
4,Couldn't put it down,"Ken Follett is one of the best ""bestseller"" authors around. And he's versatile--check out Pillars of the Earth, which couldn't be more different than this book, Triple.Triple centers on Nat Dickstein, who is working for the Israelis with the seemingly impossible task of stealing a sizable amount of uranium. Dickstein's exceedingly clever plan keeps you turning the pages, as do the counter-efforts of the Russians and Arab agents who want to derail his plan. The main characters are well-developed and multi-sided--and the ""bad guys"" are not just cookie-cutter heavies--they have their sympathetic side as well. Which, I think, is what kept me from putting the book down until I finished it. Great reading for a vacation, trip or just relaxation."
4,Follett post 9/11,"I read this book looking for some post 9/11 escapism focused on the middle east. This is a fast moving action story that maintains its pace through all 340 pages. Follett has created an unforgettable character in Nat Dickstein, who in many ways is a metaphor for Israel herself. He has found a way to leave his hatred behind, yet methodically pursues his aims by any means necessary, looking hopefully towards a peaceful future.In my view this is as good as ""Eye of the Needle"", and maybe better than ""Pillars of the Earth"" which I thought was overlong. Follett shows us the Israelis, Egyptians and Russians all in a bright light, where it is the ends, and not the means, that counts."
4,Triple,"Not myu favorite Ken Follett book, but good. It started out slowly, but picked up later. An interesting story in the end."
4,I stay hungry,"Noticing Arnold was in this movie, was what drew my attention to Stay Hungry. The backstory to some of the characters I felt was kind of unnecessary. What I mean was that they could have done better. It was an entertaining movie nonetheless. I just think the title of the movie could have had a little more focus."
2,Better to rent it,"Strange, strange movie. Doesn't really have much of a plot. Goes from real estate deals to hosting Ahnold playing bluegrass to a bunch of uppercrust sissies to half naked body builders running around Charleston to catch someone, but with time to stop and pose."
2,"Meh, a few funny parts","This is a definite Rent, there are a few lines that are pretty good. The story line is god awful but if your a muscle head there are some lines and parts to die for, I mean its freaking Arnold!Anyways ya rent it~"
2,Only for the most die-hard fans,"This DVD is truly an ""abstract"" look at the band. Sadly, the songs on the DVD are not in their entirety. This really does look like it was put together by a film student in a hurry. I cannot see most people who are Primus fans getting into this, as it lacks any real substance. It may keep you watching for the whole time once, but I would doubt many would go back for seconds. As mentioned in another review, one of the real highlights is the 2065 Les interview. Unfortunately, there is just not enough music."
4,Those Nutty Primus Guys Get Funky.,"Les, Larry and Tim are presented here in psychedelic form, which means if your feeling a little strange right now, then be prepared to feel like a Timothy Leary lab experiment gone wrong after you watch this one.This is basically film clips of interviews with the band and some concert footage, but every single frame of film is presented in the weird, acid trip format. But there's some good footage here and there, just not a straight-forward concert.It's has it's funny moments: after all this is Les Claypool we're talking about here, not George Bush! Hey wait a minute ... ?So look at this DVD from the standpoint it's a good Primus disc worth watching, plus the fact that even though it's done in a strange way, it still sort of makes sense by the end. You'll either laugh and think the guys in Primus are nuts, or you'll wonder why anyone ever bothered to put this out.It's still Primus, though. And that means you have to at least check it out."
4,AWSOME DVD!!!!!,I recomend that you buy this if your a truly Primus die hard fan. The interviews are great. learned some things that i didnt know about Primus before. Awsome footage....buy it!!!
1,Waste of time,"In the day when almost every band has a DVD out with high-quality video concert footage, there's no excuse for this dreck. Even the concert footage -- few and far between the waste-of-time segments of travel and digital distortion -- are badly lit and cut off. Why this was even made is unexplained. Why Primus would deem to put their name on it is almost inexcusable. Don't waste your money ... I got a copy from the library and I couldn't even watch it once."
5,Pitt kickoff song,"This was a gift for a person that is a fan of the Pittsburgh Panthers, and their kick off song is ""Battle w/o honor: So I got the whole CD for them...The group is awesome, the song is great, and they are loving it to death. As usuall the delivery rate for Amazon is tremendous."
5,Holy crap this rocks!,"This is one of the few albums where the term 'bad-ass' just isn't enough. This album is well worth it's cost for the title song along (Battle Without Honor Or Humanity (Kill-Bill theme)), except every song is nearly as good!Imagine Rob Zombie doing the Immigrant Song. Yes. Seriously."
2,Not worth buying one great track.,"Having heard one of the sharpest guitar hooks EVER in Kill Bill, Volume Whatever, I thought it would be worthwhile to buy this CD and go through the myriad of geek hoops to avoid copy-protection Hades to get in on my computer. Dude, save your money and just get the Kill Bill soundtrack. The rest of this CD is just 80s-awful. Completely beyond comprehension."
5,"WOW!! I'm not big into drums&bass,...but","Dieselboy has matured, for sure. This album uses more than your stock snare & hat to keep the groove. The bass track on some of the earlier albums *moves* and drives. Some effects applied to the drum track also add to the motion and the rhythm. Rarely boring (like most D&B) and almost never annoying (except for the occasional vocal stuff) this album just keeps going and going. A definite ""owner"" for any D&B fans, and for those just getting bridging into drums&bass, you might want to check this one out."
4,A Good Project,"There were a few problems I had with this album. Some tracks seem slow with the same pace. Also, by adding rap vocals, it just didn't work for me. It ruined the whole mood of the music.Though, I most enjoyed track 6 ""Altitude"" and track 7 ""California Curse"" from disc 1. The sound of the monkey calling bring out liveliness to the album."
5,THE BEST AT HIS BEST!,"He has done it again, with athority. Dieselboy has topped his previous mixes once again. A smooth ride with a great DARK and HEAVY beats. If your a mild or heavy Drum n' Bass listen you need this CD in your collection. I don;t even mind the rap here and there, yet my favorite track is number 15, Terminal Volocity. Again, do yourself a favor and pick this one up, and if you already have it, buy another copy."
4,Punishing,"How you could call this ""Project Human"" is beyond me. The music is unquestioningly posthuman. An endless stream of futuristic, punishing jungle beats. The pseudo movie trailer intro to the CD is amusing, but you'll probably program your player to skip it after a while. The bonus CD is excellent (but unmixed). Definitely shows that American jungle/drumnbass is on par with anything coming out of the UK (although some of the acts on the CD are UK-based)."
3,Good but flawed language course,"I have used this book to brush up on Khmer and improve my vocabulary. Overall a good teaching tool, but some of the translations between Khmer and English are flawed, or just plain wrong. Some of the pronounciations suggested on the accompanying tapes are at variance with native language pronunciation. I work in an agency where the majority of the staff are native Khmer speakers, from different parts of the country, and I haven't heard anyone using some of the pronunciations suggested. Some of the vocabulary is actually loan words from French, as opposed to the actual Khmer word for the thing in question, most notably the words for hotel, restaurant and doctor. There are actual Khmer words for these, but the book uses terms derived from French, such as ""otel"", ""restaurang"" and ""docktor"" instead of the authentic terms."
2,Choose Once Again -- poor condition,"One of our favorite books -- 5 stars, for sure. The book's condition, however, was not ""like new"". It was filled with mold & had a moldy smell. Not suitable for the gift we'd wanted. We'd return it, except that the postage makes it not worthwhile."
4,Choose Once Again,This is a small but delightful book of inspiration about the loving creation that we are an important part of.
2,NOT 60 MINUTES,"This video is NOT 60 minutes, as stated, but ""approx. 45 minutes"" the same as the ""A Life In Music"" DVD also listed with Amazon.It is truly a problem when Amazon does not have accurate information for the products it lists for sale.Now I have two copies of this identical documentary with the same people praising Chet Atkins, who truly was a master at the guitar."
5,cake stand,"i ordered two holiday dessert wedding cake stand 3 tier and they are beautiful. the only problem is, it don't come with bottoms. you would have to buy them separate."
5,"Small bite, bit taste","My family's sweet tooth is always satisfied and I don't have to worry about left overs tempting me. This is one of my favorite cookbooks. Some of my favorites from this cookbook are the red velvet cake, pumpkin bread pudding, and Triple Crown derby tart. I make a little two-layer cake for friends at work and they love it. These desserts are simple, tasty, and nearly too cute to eat. Nearly..."
5,My gals all love this book.,Bought this book for my daughters and all three have so enjoyed it. They have had success with all the recipes and love the idea of not making vast quantities of baked goods when all they wanted was a small dessert.
3,Expensive!,"Though the recipes in this book sound very appetizing, a lot of them call for liquers, heavy cream, and other high-fat ingredients like real butter. This not only makes the recipe high-fat, but expensive! I've made a couple of them, and have enjoyed the results, but they are not so good for one's cholesterol. Another problem I've had is using cans to bake small cakes. I don't know what they were like when Ms. Nakos was writing this book, but all the cans I've purchased products in lately have ridges running around the middle, and though I haven't yet tried baking in one of them, I imagine it would be hard to make the cake slide out. Also, I haven't been able to easily find tart pans with removable bottoms. Although it looks appealing, I find I haven't used this book much, and don't recommend it to anyone who wants a healthy diet."
2,It's just OK,I bought this so I hopefully would be able to just make small batches of sweets. I'm a big baker. The recipes are just OK. I think I'd rather make a real dessert and give what I don't need away.
2,Needs better editing/proofreading!,"Great concept, but really lousy editing/proofreading. When the book arrived, I sat down to read - got through the acknowledgments, intro, and the first recipe and felt like tossing the book in the trash. Too many mistakes that should have been corrected before going to print! More than one in the acknowledgments. And the FIRST RECIPE in the book has a mistake. Sheesh!"
4,Small-Batch Baking,Arrived in timely manner. Was in condition described. Thanks. I've really enjoyed the book. :)
2,Old B movie silliness,"I bought this movie because I wanted to see more of Mantan Moreland. Police chief Edgar Kennedy played his usual role as the slow burning cop. Mantan had less time in this show, so the movie was much diminished by his small role. Cosmo Jones was a pathetic little nerd who was trying to be a detective. Overall the movie was a disappointment."
1,Is this book about U2 or Lola Cashman??,"I have just 3 words for this book...trash, trash, and more trash. There is nothing new or interesting here. True U2 fans will most assuredly already know all of the ""gossip"" the author shares here...and anything that's new is not worthy of being printed. In addition, there are way too many pages devoted to Ms. Cashman's life before and after the time she was lucky enough to have worked with U2, which doesn't have anything to do with her time with U2. I really didn't want to buy this book, but I guess curiosity got the better of me and I figured there would be some interesting tidbits. Unfortunately I was wrong."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have just 3 words for this book...trash, trash, and more trash. There is nothing new or interesting here.

4,A must read for all hard core U2 fans,"I finally plucked up the courage to buy this book and i am so glad i did.I am a huge fan of U2 and after reading the unauthorised stories, certainly felt like i had a better understanding of what actually takes place behind the scenes with such superstars and their management. After all we are all grown ups and i can well believe Lola's stories of inhouse jealousy and power struggles.I would like to have read more about Lola and her adventures. A must read for all hard core U2 fans"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,I've never read a more selfish book than this one. Why anyone should care what this author has to say escapes me. She certainly didn't prove me wrong in this assumption. I was so disappointed in reading it I couldn't even finish her even more selfish epilogue. I feel like I need to pay someone to take this book off my hands.Its just poor writing and story telling in general. I could go on and on. I thought I was going to gain some insight if she actually made an impact with her contributions to the band but even she couldn't brag about that because she really had no impact what so ever.What a fraud. She writes a book about herself in the context of U2 yet puts Bono on the cover. If you're going to write a book about yourself put yourself on the cover. I wish I could get my money back for this book.(...)P>good luck and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
1,This is fraud.,"""My Life With..."" turns out to be nothing more than a couple of months in the late eighties. Unfortunately you will only discover this too late. ""Inside the Zoo"" would for most suggest that the writer will be sharing some real insider knowledge or behind the scenes perspective on the band, its members, their creative side etc. You'll get absolutely none of that in this book, its just a fraud. You'll learn virtually nothing new about the band (and this is the first book I've ever read on U2) but a whole lot about the writer, whether you are interested or not. I felt cheated after reading the book. It pretends to be something it is not. The claim that the writer was ""part of the inner sanctum of U2"" does not show in the book, at all. One of my dumbest buys ever. Avoid."
1,Absolutely terrible,"DVD Copy Plus 5 is a miserable, awful piece of software. It doesn't even include an instruction manual! Customer service is surly and incompetant. Buyer beware! The software description makes it seem like it'll encode DVDs into DivX but that's anything but the case! I tried creating a backup VCD of an 11 minute short movie, and it took one hour, and required TWO CD-ROMS! An absolute fraud."
2,Should Have Been Left As It Was.,"I saw this some years ago on Australian T.V., it was originally 3 50minute(approx)episodes and was excellent as it went through Wilders movies in depth in chronilogical order. This DVD has been cut down to 70mins and continually jumps backwards and forwards, making no sense at times, leaving the other 70odd minutes in the ""Special Features"" section on individual films. Should have been left as it was. In a word: Disappointing."
2,Has potential.,I like the documentary style and candid shots of their trip to the South of Brazil. Image quality is excellent. There are definately some beautiful women walking the streets and beaches of Brazil. You can see why a lot of the supermodels come from Brazil. But a lot of the clips of the attractive women in public are too short and jumpy. The soundtrack is too loud and some of the clips are way too long. I would have preferred to hear live sound than a distracting soundtrack. It would have been nice to have seen these guys show actual footage on how they picked up these women even if they had to stage it. There are some beautiful women in the video that I wish they would have invited up to their hotel room to get some sexy footage of. Most of the women that they took up to their room were average looking and not that attractive.Definately not xxx but r rated.
1,Bad topos and uses outdated B system,"This book is simply out of date. Horan's guide has descriptions like ""I did some problem on this face in 1986"". Wow, what research. His 'Best of Boulder Bouldering' is a dramatic improvement. Benningfield's 'Colorado Bouldering' guide is better with some photos of boulders and more problems. But even that guide is quickly becoming out of date."
4,"Good Product, Simple and Easy to Use","I purchased this product to simplify longer cuts along a straight edge where a mounted cutter was too confining, and shears presented too many variances in the cut (potentially shaky operator influenced...).Pros: Good product, easy to use, reliable safety features, cuts well with thin material (paper thin)Cons: The product does not perform as well on heavier materials, and the blade can hang up on card stock thickness paper, which caused 'dimples' in the cut when the wheel failed to rotate completely (even with varying degrees of tightness of the mounting nut). It had no problems with thin sheet vinyl.Summary: Overall a good product for the price, works as expected, but if you have heavier stock to cut, consider a more robust rotary cutter with bearings and a deeper blade."
4,Fiskar cutter,Fiskar cutter great ..did not know that there is a difference between the cutter & the trimmer handle so unfortunately this handle does not fit the blade I bought which it turns out is for a Fiskar trimmer 28MM... so beware!!
4,exciting and informative,"I though about writing books myself about my (30) year as a private detective for tahoe bureau of investigation in Lake Tahoe. As I was searching the libraries for information on how to write a friend of mine told me he had read a book written by a baublitz and could no longer find a copy for me, so I tried amazon.com today on the hopes that I could find one. It looks like they have one. I sure wish I had some money or a credit card so I could order it. I have been disabled since 1988 and in and out of the hospital so much, now I am a professional dead beat with no credit or credit cards. I still want to read any books by baublitz'. I do have one by reverend baublitz I got from researching the name baublitz, in Pennsylvania. Hey, did you know there are 111 baublitz's now?"
5,BEST 5TH WARD BOYZ CD EVER!!!!!!,first of all I ordered the remastered version and it is worth every penny it really sounds great. the album itself is great as well it is my fav cd from these guys it is gangsta as hell and the beats are really good.
3,Rated Gangsta!!!!!!,"This right here is straight gangsta!!!! 5th Ward Boyz take u on a journey thru da grimy streetz, n i dont mean NORE grimey. There detail to every detail is amazing. Standout traccz include Concrete Hell, Situationz, and Your Life. Get this if u into Scarface, cuz deeze boyz on diz album rip juzt like Face."
3,Works for my application. Entries lack detail.,"This encyclopedia suite works decently for my applications, which is obtaining a reference for college work assigned by instructors that prohibit the use of wikipedia as a source. My only negative is that several encarta entries lack the detail found in classic encyclopedia book editions. The mathematical calculators work well, and they provide some instruction on how results/answers are obtained. Not bad software, but not great."
2,overpriced,Not as heavyweight as I expected. Feel is sort of cheap. Would not purchase these again! The only good thing was that they came quickly.
4,Sony MVCCD500 CD Mavica,I love this camera. It takes great pictures. Simple to use. The best thing about it is the CD it uses. You do not have to take up space in your computer. Your pictures are already stored on the CD.
5,Marvelous Mavica CD,I've been using the SONY MVCCD500 CD Mavica for about 9 months in forensic engineering work. The camera has been completely reliable inspite of some rough handling and adverse conditions. Disc media has huge capacity and is great for archiving photographic evidence. Read only media helps defend against accusations of digital photo tampering. Resolution is adequate for some surprisingly good enlargements. Zeiss lense is supurb.
4,Good but slow,"I agree with all the positive statements from other reviewers. Sony CD cameras are really good. Only downside you should be aware of is the relatively long write time to transfer image to cd at high resolution. During this time the camera isn't usable. I found myself frustrated at times wanting to take the next picture and waiting for the write to finish, which is frustrating when you really want the next shot.If you can afford it, step up the the entry SLR's (such as the new Canon EOS Rebel) and you get all the benefits of this sony, plus more, and very fast picture taking -- closer to film cameras."
4,camera,"the picture quality is excellent. Focus and view finder options are excellent.The only thing that is limiting, is a slow recording and disk access time. This is not an action camera and not for shooting pictures of something in a sequence. Great for brochures and gives you the ability to take a picture, crop it on your computer and still have enough quality to blow it up again."
1,My $800 camera only worked for a couple years!,"It was great, while it lasted. Although it's too heavy to take on every trip and take those impulsive candid shots. It fits in my diaper bag, but not my purse. About 6 months ago (after 18 months of ownership) we started having trouble getting it to turn on. My husband figured out a ""trick"" to turn it on (push down on the button while pushing the lever), which worked for a month or so. Then suddenly, the problem disappeared. Yippee! Now, with Christmas less than a month away, it WON'T TURN ON AT ALL!!! I cannot explain how furious I am. It's not like I can send it for repair and have it back by the holidays. My other complaint is with the batteries. Over time, they last less and less..... and take longer and longer to charge up. You will definitely need more than 2 batteries after a while. My next camera will NOT be a Sony. IT's not like we were rough with it; we treated that thing with more care than the baby... and it still busted. grrrr....."
4,"Great Camera, how do I take Black and White pictures though?",I got this camera a few days ago. I love it. One problem though. It advertises that it can take black and white pictures. And I have been looking online for some technical help to find out how to do this and I can't seem to find any. One of the main reasons I bought this camera was for the black and white pictures. If anyone can help me with this please e-mail me at mommapunkin@msn.com. Otherwise its awesome!!!
5,Any other MAVICA enthusiasts out there?,"I prefer SONY MAVICAS because they so easily accommodate the 3 inch disk CD-R/CD-RW which hold 156MB - 190MB per disc giving me the flexibility of unlimited memory storage and costing 0.50 cents per disc as opposed to the overtly pricey habit of replenishing COMPACT FLASH memory cards (or precious memory-sticks as SONY calls them). More importantly, I don't have to lug around my laptop on holiday excursions... !I have a Sony MVCCD500 CD Mavica 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom .Instead of the laptop, I'd rather carry along as well my devoted 35mm Canon film SLR longtime companion (for old times' sake) along with my 8-month old Mavica. Any thoughts to share?!Can't wait for the new 6MP SONY MAVICA dual video/still to come out."
1,Lots of problems,"I have had a Sony Mavica for the past two years and I have been having a lot of problems with it. In fact I just got it back today from the service department in Tx and it still doesn't work. The screen went blank one day, just wouldn't show photos on the LCD. I sent it into Sony free of charge and a new LCD was placed in the camera. When I got the camera back there was a distinct color shift. The colors look correct on the LCD, but on all other devices my photos are magenta instead of red, which make my kids look purple. I can color correct in Photo Shop, but for a $500.00 camera it is turning out to be a real boat anchore. Save your money, buy anything but Sony. The second round of service cost me a whopping $223.00. Which now makes my boat anchore worth $723.00."
3,"Great , But .....","I love the camera and all the features . I don't miss 35 mm as much as I thought I would with this camera . I love that you can just click and e-mail right away . One problem is that I used the mavica discs and found them to be great , but expensive . So I did what every one else did , used a cheaper disc , not Mavica . They worked for a while but now , won't work at all .It won't intialize or finalize . They were not kidding when they warn that other discs will damage your camera . I called Sony and they tell me this is what happens . I have a useless camera now , it won't even work with the Mavica disc. I can still see all the already recored disc from the past but can't make any new . It's ashame because the camera takes the best digital pictures i have seen .They need to work on this since you can't even find the mavica disc in my area .Thanks alot Sony ."
2,"Not Mac-friendly, Too Complicated","Very complicated, not a entry level camera. You need to have prior digital photography experience to master this one. The manual is over 125 pages long! The mini-cds, which are a major feature of the camera can't be used in a Macintosh CD drive although you still need to finalize the images to mini-disk before you can download them via USB cable to your computer. There's only OSX support so, if you're still using OS9, you're out of luck."
2,Does'nt work with Windows XP,Beware...this camera does not work with Windows XP...the drivers for using the USB cable to transfer files won't install correctly.
1,Pretty Cover but no substance,"I'd have to agree with another reviewer who said it is essentially a very pretty 3 ring binder. I was disappointed when I opened the book. It is a slick journal cover but for the price tag it is a poor value. I suspect even those that like the idea and have made a trip to the BVI soon found they couldn't begin to hold their ""highlight"" photos in the pages."
5,A NEW SENSATION,"I just listened for the third time in a row to an amazing new cd by Gretchen Lieberum. This album is sophisticated and cool, with enough trip-hop influence to attract a younger crowd, in addition to old jazz heads like me. While the musicianship is top notch--reminiscent of what used to be know as cool jazz when I was comin' up--and the songs play like your favorite collection of short stories, the real surprise is Lieberum herself. I'd say she is one of the finest female vocalists to come down the pike in a long time. Her voice has the seductive tones and range of an older, experienced jazz singer, with the cool style of a Sade or Anita Baker. Check it out. I think Gretchen Lieberum is here to stay."
2,Winsor and Newton Canvas- Is it only ONE canvas for the price?,"The canvas i received appears to be of excellent quality, however, when I read reviews on this item i understod two of the reviewers to be saying, that they had received only one, and not six canvases as they had expected. However, they added that the error had been corrected and that they had since received all six canvases. Other reviewers were pleased with their purchase and receipt of six canvases.I took a chance and ordered the item only to be very disappointed when my package arrived and I only received ONE canvas. I am pleased with the quality but not the quantity.I am hoping that this review will prompt a redress."
2,Only got One!,I was hoping that the reviews on this product were right and that I would get six in the package. I only received one. I could have found a better deal on just one.
5,good product,excellent & quick good to how to be things done and what to expect of when you are working in fixit
5,The best Vespa book out there....,"This book was obviously written to teach the novice Vespa enthusiast the nitty-gritty details of scooter repair and restoration, through the eyes of someone who mastered the art! Bob Darnell's take on both simple and complicated tasks gives any reader invaluable insight into how to do it right! I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Very helpful,"I have the Hanes manual which is good, but it slightly intimidating if you know nothing about engines or are not mechanically inclined. This book is more friendly and actually gives me hope that I can learn and work on my own Vespa. If you or not a grease monkey by trade, this is a good book for a weekend grease monkey. And I'm not throwing poo, this book is for real."
3,Decent Book but Not a Service Manual,"I bought this book to help me service my wife's 1966 Vespa VBC, which is a large-frame 150. The book has a great overview of the Vespa company and the various Vespa models dating back to the 1940s, and a lot of general information that I find helpful. It has very little detail about servicing scooters, and is quite lacking in illustrations."
1,Poor guide,"Heaven knows we need good scooter repair rebuild guides but this isn't one. If you're a beginner this book will hardly help you at all as it lacks enough detail on each repair. If you're experienced then you won't need this book.It's very poorly detailed, if you try to do a specific job you won't find written advice or you'll find that but no illustration. This is no sticky's guide.Save your money."
5,The truth about why work and family conflict,"Jacobs & Gerson present a clear explication of the conflict between work and family encountered by so many parents today. They review popular hypotheses (e.g. Americans work more hours than they used to), examine the relevant research, and provide sound and clearly reasoned conclusions. THE TIMEDIVIDE clarifies precisely why current workplace structures areincompatible with the realities of family life today - and why this is especially the case for professionals, like the lawyers I coach. I applaud Jacobs and Gerson for making clearthat work/life conflict is a social policy issue of enormousimportance. They make a compelling case for the ways in whichindividual choices are constrained by workplace demands and social norms. If every law firm partner read this book, would things finally change enough so that women lawyers would have a fair chance at success and leadership? Would that it were so."
4,The Incredible Egg!,"A fascinating collection of delicious egg recipes that go way beyond breakfast! Categories include crepes,omelets, quiches and sauces. I like the author's emphasis on fresh ingredients and simple preparation, which makes this our ""go-to"" cookbook on busy weeknights!"
2,Only worth it for the bonus newsreel,"As many have already pointed out, the cartoons contained in this DVD are the usual sloppy job by cheapskate company Goodtimes Video. Apparently, the definition of ""digitally remastered"" is quite broad, because these cartoons (especially the color ones) look pretty bad. All the cartoons here are available in other collections, with varying degrees of quality. The only good thing about this is the rare newsreel feature that details the making of a Popeye cartoon. Animation buffs and Popeye fans will appreciate the short feature. Otherwise, we're still waiting for someone to do the spinach-eatin' sailor justice on DVD."
1,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, this work was a disappointment. It is simplistic and quite superficial- it could have been written by any lay person rather than an experienced psychotherapist."
3,Esperaba un poco mas,"Yo he sido un fiel seguidor de esta banda desde sus pricipios y creo que varias personas estabamos a la expectativa del rumbo que tendria Lucybell.Creo que el disco tiene de todo y para todos.Tiene canciones rescatables como salvame la vida,hoy sone,mi propia cruz,angel.Pancho canta 3 canciones en este disco,las cuales creo que salen totalmente de la linea de Lucybell y al verlo cantar en vivo me confirmo lo que ya pensaba.Con todo respeto....zapatero a su zapato. Aparte en vivo creo que se le va la voz un poco y en ocasiones Claudio tiene que ayudarle con unos coros.Yo me percate de esto, nadie me dijo.Este no ha sido el mejor trabajo de Lucybell.Para mi el mejor disco ha sido el disco rojo.Creo que esta critica es algo fuerte pero creo que lucybell tiene aun para mucho mas por que son muy buenos musicos.GraciasAun seguire siendo su fan"
1,este disco es malisimo no lo compren!,"Como pudieron lanzarse al mercado anglo con este disco tan malo?, que pretendio el baterista con ponerse a cantar y peor con unas letras tan mediocres?. Recomiendo el disco ROJO de estos jovenes, es una obra maestra a la par con cualquier artista internacional en su epoca."
4,Uno de los mejores grupos hoy en dia,"Hace unos años, mientras escuchaba la radio en Tijuana, me tomo por sorpresa una voz diferente y una cancion super sensual...sonaba en la radio CUANDO RESPIRO EN TU BOCA...quede enamorada, y desde entonces soy fan de Lucybell.Aunque en mi opinion este disco no es tan bueno como los anteriores, es un disco muy bien hecho.Hoy por hoy es uno de los grupos mas inovadores que ha salido de Latinoamerica...tienen un sonido muy particular, la musica y la letra te llega, te consume, asi como Soda Stereo en los viejos tiempos...Recomendado para gente que aprecia el rock bien hecho...y en vivo....uff...sensacional."
3,"Good CD, Some Strong Songs","I have been following Lucybell for an online magazine, and saw them in concert last year. I can say they are great musicians but also they are pretty dark. That's why I disagree with a few reviewers here: tracks like Ojos del Silencio actually enhance the CD and their lives shows, because it gives the audience a break to catch their breath and changes the pace, as well as touches the heart. What do I think about the future of Lucybell? Lots of upside - they could go down as a type of Latin American U2 if they continue to innovate and do not produce too many dark songs. Tough to say. In concert, they can come off as being too powerful, which is tough on the ears."
4,Francisco Gonzalez a la batería... y el disco es perfecto,"La verdad el disco es bueno... la calidad compositora de valenzuela es inagotable, y se sigue plasmando en sus temas (especialmente Mi Propia Cruz y Esperanza)... pero la única pifia del disco es que Francisco cante. Un grupo demuestra su calidad cuando tocan en vivo, y en los espacios que Francisco canta, la verdad que corta el hilo de la fuerza de power trio que ha cosechado Lucybell en estos tiempos."
4,sounding as usual,"This cd rocks!!!.Best sounding Pistols live album.And a reunion one!The new versions are great,although the guitar sounds a bit opaque and not as aggressive as in the past,Lydon's voice is still up to the task and the rythmic sectionis kick @ss tight.On the downside,I'd have expected a more polished recording for an album produced in mid 90's.Itlacks bass,treble and general dynamics,which I had to compensate for by means of heavy processing.In this particular case,that factor will cost the review just one star,only because the music is soooo damned good!!!!!!!!"
3,"Rude, Crude, and Lewd","This album gives you a good impression of what the band was like live. The pistols were not particularily skillful at playing their instruments but they'll give you a mouthfull of biting commentary, and stage energy to spare."
4,Rad old skool punk rock,This CD is really good! amazing quality for how old it is. great guitar work but the vocals get to be annoying. it's still good stuff.
1,"You are wrong, M Saylor","[...] Green Day does not spike their hair and they do not THINK they can rock. They KNOW they can rock. Know why? Because they CAN and they are infinitely better than the Sex Pistols, whose singer is annoying, whose name is crappy, and whose music never ceases to irritate. This item is just as bad as the typical Sex Pistols and I would not recommend it at all. M Saylor doesn't know what he's talking about."
1,DONT BUY THIS IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY!!!!!,"IT sucks,they call it a charger for creative zen micro but it doesn't actually CHARGE your zen micro. Save yourself some time, money, and anguish and buy the REAL CHARGER from creative themselves. Also paying $6 s&h for something that only costs $6.50 made me feel kindof..... stupid. They sent me a second one saying that the one I bought was defective but the second one ended up being ""defective"" as well? And reading the other review looks like his didn't work either so that ends up being 4 defective items total. Coincedence? I don think so! (F.Y.I I would have given this product 0 stars but according to amazon there is no level beyond hate)"
1,Does not Work!!!,Bought two since they were so inexpensive. Neither recharged my Zen Micro even after a full day! Don't waste your money!
1,"Do Not Buy, It's a Ripoff",This product does not work. PERIOD. I wrote to them for a refund and so far haven't heard back but in fairness that may be because I wrote on Saturday. They also shipped the item in the wrong box. It was a cell phone charger box. This tells me that doing business with these folks for any item is not a smart move especially since given the other reviews they are knowingly shipping a product that does not work at all.
2,Did not work,I bought this charger hoping to use it for my Zen Micro MP3 player at work. This charger did not charge my Zen.
1,Doesn't Work,"LED lights up on the charger, but it doesn't work with my Creative Zen Microphoto. Would not recommend this."
4,Death Metal + Flute,"Great album. There's something about this band. The guitars are great and the flute brings a special new sound to it. It took some time for me to get used to the singing, but when you get used to it, it's good. Whatever you want to call this, it's something new and is just about to break out. Get ready, 'coz here comes Bethzaida."
1,Uniden doesn't test their phones?,"I purchased this phone because it uses lithium ion batteries, which are the best. Unfortunately, the phone would not power on, even after charging it for several days. Returned it for a refund. Apparently, I am not alone in this experience."
5,Uniden DMX778 2.4 GHz DSS Expandable Trendy Cordless Phone with Answering System and Caller ID,i think the new undien phone i got was a blast! it has all the features i want and more. the color display is excellent and i love the compact design! it is just plainly cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Very good unit, but wish the headphone wire/jack was detachable!","Love this! Great unit for its intended purpose, which is to give ANY set of regular wired earbuds or headphones the ability to control the volume ""balance"" between the left and right ears. Excellent for anyone who may have some hearing loss in one ear, or varied levels of loss in both ears. You can customize the exact volume level for each ear to adjust the brain's perception of incoming audio in each ear.However, I would much prefer that the wire/headphone jack part that is permanently tethered to the ""balance"" main unit was DETACHABLE. The wire is WAY too long, and needlessly clunky and in the way when trying to actually use the unit. Wish there were a short separate wire supplied to use for audio input instead. If this were the case my rating would have been five stars."
4,Sennheiser HZR-62 Stereo Volume Control,Does the job as advertised. It could have a larger decibel range. I recommend it to users that need to change the volumes on the left or right channels of the song or video sound.
5,Excellent Product,"Used to replace similar Sennheiser extension purchased over 15 years ago. Old one succumbed to grandchildren abuse. No loss of signal, no ""coloring"". Just wire to wire. And Sennheiser Quality."
3,honest,"From what I remember this kid had the same birthday as Marques Houston and he kept bragging about it. It was like he was obsessed with him or something, saying that he and marques are just alike and how marques is his favorite singer and all, very weird. anyway this kid can sing. I wonder what ever happened to him. Check him out in Romeo and Juliet."
4,A Book to Enjoy Over Tea.,"Peterson has a strong understanding of the idealist movement. Especially when she discusses Wallace Stevens poetic approach and view on idealism.In his own words, ""Everything I see is another piece of the broken mirror and inside the spectrum is a picture that only I understand.""Unlock the magic of this great read!"
4,A Good Read!,"The dwindling number of full-time positions and the increasing opportunities for ""full-time temp"" and project-by-project employment has changed the definition of the word ""job."" Barbara Moses clearly defines your career challenges in today's business climate and teaches you how to shape your career in an atmosphere in which the old rules no longer apply. The author sets out step-by-step strategies for adapting to these ever-changing career parameters, and her nicely written, insightful text won't make you feel like an unemployed has-been, but just like one of the gang. You'll relax in the face of her pleasant manner, helpful examples and intriguing anecdotes. We [...] recommend this book to people in all fields at all levels, since virtually no one (not even a CEO) is immune from the new marketplace. If you don't own the company you work for, this is how to stay light on your feet."
4,Beware of sizing,"This is a VERY smart-looking jacket with details of a much, much more expensive garment. The only problem was that I ordered an X-Large and it was a Medium at best (although marked X-Large). Couldn't wear it, but have a daughter who snatched it from me before I could return it. She takes a medium and it fit her perfectly. Would have rated five stars except for the inaccurate sizing."
3,Wouldn't buy again,"I'm not pleased with this jacket. The picture makes it look really cute and comfortable, but it's very stiff and doesn't fit well. The color also doesn't come across well in the picture. It's an OK jacket, but not one I'd buy again."
4,"For the Price , You can't go Wrong!!!!!!!!!!!","Just received this jacket but it runs a little bit large, if you are a small order x small, if you are a medium order a small etc. As for the quality, I can not complain but very thin inside lining. It's perfect for maybe cool weather but not for very cold weather ( maybe wear a sweater under it ). Overall accessment , worth the $15.00 but not over that price. I would have given 5 stars but lining was kinda thin. Hope this Helps your decision in purchasing!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Wow. Very cute.,"It's amazing!!!! When it said washable suede, I figured it was a fabric suede look alike. No way. This is 100% leather shell. Really cute. Size is pretty close to accurate, maybe a little smaller than I expected. Well satisfied."
4,My first x-large jacket,"When I first went to order this jacket, there was only the one review about it, and based on that I ordered an x-large. I only just recently started wearing medium shirt, and the x-large fits me pretty well. The sleeves are a little long, but other than that it fits me fine. I don't really like the strange pattern along the sleeves and pockets and along the zipper, but since it is leather it's just a biking jacket in warm weather to me."
4,something is missing...,"In one word... Moe!don't get me wrong, I love this album but Moe!'s influence was bigger than I realized. I liken it to post-Mufti Einsturzende Neubauten, still great music but not so groundbreaking. The disc is solid through and through but the ""industrial percussion"" is now minimal and the drumming is VERY rock-n-roll and 'in your face'. It seems that this is an improvement for most listeners but I prefered it the other way around.I suppose if you come at this band from the over-used ""Bungle"" reference then you'll think it's the best thing since sliced bread. If you see SGM as more of a blend of Swans, Neubauten, and Jacques Brel then it might seem a tad flat in comparison to previous SGM.""In Glorious Times"" is still a cut above the majority of music I buy."
3,Wish it be contactless,"I'm using it for 5 years now. All conversions it makes as Composite to S-video, Comp/S-video to RF have fine quality of picture (DVD) and sound. The drawback is oxidized switch contacts, so 1-2 times in a week picture or sound became crappy and I have to switch back and forth a few times to restore circuits."
4,happy camper,"I was happy that I got this product as it is just what I was looking for. Good price compared to the stores around here. Maybe the only draw back is that the output must match up with the input. (I was hoping that I could make life simple and have only one type of output while having different ""types"" of video)."
5,modulator,"nice not having to switch hookups all the time , just push a button!If you have more than 1 gaming system this is nice to have!"
5,Works Fine,"I needed a method of connecting my VCR, DVD recorder and DVR to my TV, and this unit works fine. I use the RCA connectors, but tried a s-video connector, which worked ok. I have not tried out the coax connectors. The unit is on top of my VCR, and does not slide when the buttons are pushed."
5,Magnavox M61151 4 X 1 Video Selector/Rf Modulator,Easy hook up to older TV - allows use of DVD / VCR. Works great!
2,"Good product, but works only one way :(","I bought this product with the hopes that I could use it as an input from a cable signal and output to a s-video or video signal. I had been misled into believing this by the specs. It does not work! The only types of output allowed are from input in the four channels, not from the antenna in. I will have to keep looking I guess."
4,Pouch,"This pouch works very well. Am still looking for a 5 pocket, but it has held up well, and would buy one again."
4,4 foot bench,wanted this for a garage bench...doing a house remodel and have a lot of left over and smaller 2 x 4 boards and thought this would be a cheap and easy way to use them! works well for my purpose. may consider matching pieces latter on.....
5,Quick and easy!,"These things are great, I have several of them now. I do recommend that you very from the instructions a bit and use (2) 2x6's with (1)2x4 in the middle instead of (4)2x4's. It will GREATLY reduce the number of ass piches and I think it looks better as well."
3,bench or table legs,"Were too wide to use for my slab of wood, but would be great if wood wider, or for a picnic table bench, maybe."
4,Build A Bench,Easy to build - Sturdy and attractive. Good for holding plants or strong enough for sitting. Using P.T. lumber makes it perfect for the yard.
2,Not as good as it appears,I bought this to replace one that broke in my picnic table set. The bench has no stability in the side ways direction. The board in the bottom is not properly supporting the bench. I added a board across the ends of the bottom board and some 45 degree braces to add strength to the bench
4,Great little project,"This is the third time I have purchase this item. I thought it would be an easy project for my grandson to learn how to operate a drill, and the bench came out great. I do wish they would include some type of spacers to use between the 2 x 4's, but my checkers worked fine. My grandson was very proud of his accomplishment."
3,Good but can break,"Several years ago at a big box store we came across the 2x4 basics any size table or bench product. We were having a family reunion in a few week so we bought a set of table legs and two sets of bench legs. It worked out great. In fact my son who has 5 kid and a wife said, ""this is great I should get one of these we can all sit at one table."" Five kids on the one side and his wife and him on the other, plus room for company. We made an 8"" table and benches. We have now bought a second set of bench legs and it is working out great to have an extra bench. However we did have some company over and three of the larger people were sitting on one of the benches and one of them shifted their weighty sideways and the legs broke. That was a disappointment. But all in all we are satisfied with the 2x4 basic."
2,Misled,This pictured as a bench and what I thought I was buying. It wasn't clear to me that I had to purchase the wood.
4,Plasticy but stable,"The product only contains resin legs and not the lumber or any other support. You can use various material for the top. I have built three benches using these legs, from 2 ft to 6 ft long. I used fairly heavy material for the top - TREX for 2 benches and granite top for the third. TREX is heavy and flexible material so I ended up using middle support using 2x4s. I used cedar base for the granite top. All three benches are very heavy. These legs hold them well. I am taking one star off for looks. These legs stand out as molded plastic."
3,Encryption by Example let down by early chapters,"This isnt a bad book despite the 3 stars I've given it. The first part of the book describes the theory and aspects of cryptography. I felt it was rather waffly and not precise enough. I wanted more diagrams and more stuff like Appendix A in the early chapters. By page 100 I felt the knowledge I had learnt could have been dealt with in 10 pages.The 2nd half of the book is quite good. Lots of walk throughs with the likes of verisign (getting a digital id) and emailing with PGP. However, the book assumes you already have the software, eg PGP and I had to refer to Appendix B to find where to download software."
3,A good explanation of encryption basics including Internet.,How private are your Internet communications? Would you like an explanation of electronic encryption technology? You may want to determine how much information you are willing to give away - and how much to protect..The first half of the book is a good explanation of encryption basics that clearly details theory and mechanics. The second half demonstrates useful Internet protection schemes.
5,children with fas/fae,Book was in great shape and the content of the book was very helpful in my work with these children.
3,OK book but not as good as expected,"With a bit of knowledge on BEM, I decided to read this book to see if I could learn more, especially on elastomechanics (after reading the 5 star high praise sung by the first reviewer here). The introduction to the method is slow, with discussion on vector algebra, programming, machine precision and things like that in the first few chapters. You see the boundary integral equation (something important in BEM) only after 80 pages (a new learner will probably give up trying to understand what BEM is after so many pages). After that, the narrow focus of the book is on static problems. Maybe it's possible to pick up something on BEM formulation of elasticity, but I doubt it is a good book for new learners of BEM. I would not rate it as high as the first reviewer here: I would consider 3 star a generous rating for the book."
4,"Some Great Music, But Definitely NOT LIVE","This is a fine compilation of some excellent tunes that were recorded during the period when Ellington's orchestra was performing frequently at the Cotton Club in Harlem. However, the title is rather misleading, and Amazon's designation of this as a live album is even more so. These are NOT live recordings, but studio recordings."
2,disappointing !,"This is not a bad album, Tina Turner hasn't made bad albums since 1979. I only give it 2 stars because it is so predictable. Her voice is still great, but the production of Wildest Dreams is so ""controlled"". That is why if you here her singing ""Missing You"" live at a concert, it just shows what a great singer she is. On the studio version however you don't get this feeling. The title track is such a stupid "" Oh baby"" song ! She can do much better. If only Phil Spector would record with her again..."
4,Nice Read.,"A Nice Read. Interesting, engaging and informative. Tells you what you probably wanted to know about ""Balloons at War"". I recommend it."
4,Excellent Photographs,"The book is outstanding from the photographic perspective. The pictures take you through different areas of Normandy where engagements took place in June and July of 1944.On the other hand, I was disappointed by the narrative provided by the author, which, in some cases, was inaccurate (example: 14,000 Americans were killed on Omaha Beach).As a WWII buff and a tourist, the book brought back many memories, but buy the book for the photos, not for information contained in the narrative."
5,stunning,This necklace was bought for my wife who is an avid darts fan. in fact it's the 2nd one i have purchased because she misplaced the 1st one. The quality for the price paid is unbelievable and is far better looking than similar ones in the uk that cost 3 x as much. i would recommend this necklace to anyone.
2,disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewer porkchp, it's ok, but if you wanted to hear stuff like the track 'ordinary life' from the cruel intentions soundtrack, you'll be disappointed. Ordinary life is not even on this CD."
3,Couple of Nice Cuts,"While otherwise undistinguishable, Big Girl is a very nice uptempo garage-style rocker (think Runaways) with proactive lyrics, something not always found in Barry's work. A second nod goes to Don't Cry, a cover of a Neil Young song from Freedom (which is not on The Bridge tribute CD)."
2,adequate singing but a very dreary production,"My favourite performance of this delightful work is the 1982 Glyndebourne Festival release under Haitink. Fantastic sets and costumes and as light as a feather. Unfortunately the video and sound shows its age. This production is, to be blunt, dead dreary. A mixture of suits and pyjamas that looked as if they might have been borrowed from a church shop. The make up of the doctors was so bad one really wondered if they had had to do it themselves on the tram on the way to the performance! For a fantasy opera such as this, this is just unacceptable economy, especially at Blu ray prices. The sets are not much better and the involvement of the conductor in the ""humour"" just did not work for me. In many ways this is somewhat similar to the multi suited DVD release from Paris with better video and sound but even more unenterprising costumes and sets. Despite its age Haitink knocks both these performances for six! Dont waste your money."
2,Tedious. Graf has done better,"Sorry, but I thought that this one was tedious, predictable, and relatively hard to follow. Plus, it just did not impart that ""sense of wonder"" that characterize the best Star Trek stories. Basically, Chekov, Uhura, and McCoy beam down to a planet which has a strange ecology undergoing an ice age. Just about everything about this planet is unhelpful--the transporter won't work, sensors from the Enterprise don't work, phasers work poorly and some stupid decisions deprive the Landing Party of phasers anyway. Plus, some fairly obvious problems cause most humans to go insane after a brief stay on the planet. All of this is very apparent from the first portion of the novel, and it makes the ending relatively predictable.This novel was not particularly absorbing, and I was glad when I reached the relatively predictable ending. There are better Star Trek novels out there."
2,"A little good, a lot of bad","The alien race was actually interesting, but could have been fleshed out more. Chekov was the high point: we get into his thoughts as head of security and as a leader. McCoy dukes it out with another doctor, which was entertaining.But McCoy also turns out to be afraid of water in a childhood flashback, then predictably gets trapped in a cabin filling up with water. That kind of stuff ruins a book for me. Long-lost relatives, ""incurable"" diseases, and previously-unknown phobias are the refuge of bad writers who can't see the rich characters right in front of them."
5,Excellent for Star trek lovers,This is my favorite author - LA GRAF -- never sure if it was a single writer or multiple (lets all get rich and famous) but love these
4,Exciting ice adventure focusing on Chekov and Uhura,"I enjoyed Ice Trap, and recommend it for fans of the Original Series. Uhura and Chekov share the main storyline, and their adventure on an ice planet is suspenseful and exciting. There is a weaker subplot involving McCoy and Kirk, but still engaging. Especially worthwhile if you want a change of pace from the novels that always feature Kirk and Spock at the forefront."
2,"Given the other reviews, I was disappointed.","Dr. White's book is very short and basic. For more complete information on emergency childbirth (plus lots of other first aid and self medication subjects), I would get David Werner's excellent book, ""Where There Is No Doctor"". For a beautifully illustrated book that covers all aspects of home birth, including complications and emergency childbirth, I recommend ""Heart and Hands: A Midwife's Guide to Pregnancy and Birth"" by Elizabeth Davis."
4,"one of the best ""NEVER HEARD"" albums","Pluto is as much punk as they are pop and vice versa. These guys write more memorable hooks than almost every punk/pop band that ever existed. ""Regenerate"" is worthy of hit-single era Joe Jackson. ""Failure,"" ""Blaupunk,"" ""Uncola,"" ""When She Was Happy,"" and ""It's Over"" would all be huge hits if they were released today. One of the best albums that ""no one ever heard."""
1,Bubblegum Punk,"Pluto is a ""punk"" pop band....I guess they sound it like Green day on their first essays. The best of the CD is the front cover, after that, there is nothing much to add here, Bubblegum PUNK and that's it. Nice effort guys, but I didn't feel anything with your CD. I am going to the Used CD's store for change."
4,The Golden Voice,"Marion Lush is truly the Golden Voice of Polkas.While his polka music is some of the best of Chicago Style,This album contians only a few of his hits.I bought this cassette in order to get the song: Innocent Eyes.Like many of his songs, the melody comes from an old Polish folk song."
4,Have to Disagree with Previous review,"I am also currently taking a statistics course with Selvin at Berkeley. I took another stats course before this and despite everyone RAVING about how fabulous that class was, I found it made my head spin. Everytime I felt I understood a concept was like an epiphany, unfortunately it would quickly diminish due to more complicated examples and statistical theory.Selvin's book (as well as class) has erased the mystery for me. I find the book thorough with clearly explained concepts and multitudes of relevant examples. Probability, smobability. Linear regression, no problem.I'm giving the book 4 stars because of the editorial mistakes, otherwise I'd have given it 5 all the way."
3,Use With Caution,"I purchased Larenim eyeshadow in three different shades. All of them are shiny and highly pigmented.Pink Divinity is a lovely shade, but that shininess makes this border on frosty. Unless your skin is very yellow, you can use it as an accent color. I use this on the inner corner and under my brows, OR a tiny bit above my irises over my base shade, OR a tiny bit along my cheek bones.Pale pink can be such a lovely way to accent your best features, but this eyeshadow is so shiny, you must be careful, or you will look likeMy Little Pony."
5,The Sword and the Hunk,"I bought this movie without ever seeing it, just for Lee Horsley. I wasnt disapointed, it was great. I enjoyed the campy scenes and the evil that was woven throughout. The sword greatly appealed to my sci-fi side while the bare chested men appealed to my other side!! The battle scene at the end where he jumps up to the balcony and catches the sword on the way was fantastic. Only thing I didnt like was the evening dress that was suppose to be a period wedding dress. I give it 5 stars for action and comedy and a little gore tossed in to keep you watching. Anything with Lee is good, that honey voice and dark eyes...."
1,Horrible!,"I'm shocked at all these rave reviews. This movie is so horrible!First of all, it speeds through a plot that drags with no body. This movie is confusing and empty of a good plot and dialogue.I liked Krull way better than this and for some reason Krull got worse reviews. *shrugs* I don't understand. I guess to each their own.One thing I can say it is better than Beastmaster 2, so if you are up for a cheesy sorcery movie than go for it, but honestly there are so many better fantasy movies out there. If I had a second chance, I wouldn't have wasted my dollar on renting it."
3,"If this is 1:85 widescreen anamorphic, I'll eat my hat...","Love the genre, so I'll keep my DVD copy of this.However, the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired, and I have other 1:85 anamorphic DVD's that look MUCH better than the picture on this one. There are so many two-shots (two people conversing) where the tops of their head are chopped off that I feel I'm watching a pan & scan of Lawrence of Arabia...Still - schlocky, delicious S&S fantasy is hard to get, so if you like this genre, get this one!"
1,Yikes,"The opening scene of this fantasy film, in which the sorcerer of the title is called back from the dead, shows promise. But then it's all downhill from there. Every aspect of this terrible production screams amateur-hour, despite the Amazon reviewer's assertion that director Albert Pyun apprenticed under Akira Kurosawa. Richard Lynch makes a reliable villain, and Kathleen Beller is very easy on the eyes, but otherwise the flick is pure torture./"
1,"Sucks. Bad,","If you like movies like ""Krull"" or ""Beastmaster,"" this movie will NOT amuse you. I could barely tell one character from another; the plot was so stupid, at an hour and forty minutes, it felt like work finishing it. There's action, sure, and a few nude scenes to keep morons occupied for a few minutes.I love sword and sorcery movies, and while this looks like a gem for your DVD collection, belive me, it is not. This is just as bad as ""Dungeons and Dragons."" I guess I should add, for the sake of fairness, if you liked ""Dungeons and Dragons,"" you'll love this. But if you thought it was another tired attempt by corporate Hollywood to suck dollars from your pockets, stay away from this loser.Let me put it this way: ""Gor"" is a better movie than this one.Luckily, I rented the film, so I could return it. You'd be better off drinking the fifteen bucks you'd spend on this sucky movie. At least you'll feel magical.My advice, watch Krull 20 times before you see this p.o.s. once."
1,The Pits,"I watched it with my wife, and we both agree that it was horrible. The plot is hard to follow, and the story is rather lame. It barely qualifies as a fantasy movie. I ended up throwing it away. I should have gotten one of the Conan or old Sinbad movies; they are piles better."
3,Trashy entertainment!,"Yes, it's goofy. I love Richard Lynch. He can play really ugly characters and not need special makeup (kinda like Ron Pearlman). Lee Horsley ... did this son of a gun fall off the earth? In a minor part as one of Cromwell's villanous hordes is Robert Tessier. Best remembered for his cage fight in HARD TIMES (where old Charlie Bronson beat on his pointy-bald head like a drum). If you don't ask for much thsn this film delivers."
4,The Sword and The Sorcerer,"This was one of the better sword fantasy movies of the 70's. I enjoyed watching this movie when I was younger and purchased this movie for my teenage son to watch. He enjoyed it as well, although he commented on the special effects being very cheesy compared to what they have now. I reminded him that this was 30 years ago. For then, I think the special effects were rather good."
5,Sword and the sorcerer,"The movie was a good one, however even the lowest asking price is too expensive. The movie is almost 30 years old and is not worth more than 10.00 at the most. Would not buy it here."
3,Not good as Beastmaster and Conan! :(,"This movie is not exciting and action-packed as Beastmaster and NOTHING interesting as Conan. The storyline is VERY slow, there are many silly dialoges, poor acting, BAD battle choreography, no exciting adventure scenes, no particular monsters, and it has some few cool action scenes.The reason that I gave this movie 3 stars is because of the FREAKING COOL THREE-BLADED SWORD, the dark settings, bloody killings, production desings, and the last 15 minutes of the final battle that finally became interesting and exciting.P.S: I don't care if this movie is low budget because Conan and Beastmaster were also low budget, but they were COOL! This one failed. If you are looking for a fantasy movie with a cool conclution then maybe this one is for you, but if you expect to be glued to the screen for 99 minutes then pass on this one.Adios."
2,"""My Kingdom For A Night With The Princess"" ~ A Man Who Knows His Priorities","'The Sword and the Sorcerer' released in '82 is a mixed bag of positive and negative.The Negative: The production values are marginal, the picture quality overall dark and grainy. The dialogue doesn't fair any better, it's also dull and uninspired. As for the storyline, well I found it extremely uneven with some parts of the movie excruciatingly slow and others quite good.The Positive: Lee Horsley is surprisingly engaging as the vagabound, warrior Prince Talon and Kathleen Beller is breathtaking as Princess Alana, she's never looked better. The film is worth at least one watch just to see Kathleen in her prime. There are also numerous other very lovely ladies (such as Anna Bjorn) in this production that will keep all the young male viewers interest peaked.Cast includes; Richard Moll, George Maharis, Richard Lynch, Simon McCorkindale and Robert Tessier, one of the great tough guys in film."
4,Superman - Childhood Fun,I been searching for classic cartoons for myself but mostly for my kids. When I was a child my favorite superhero was and still is Superman. By watching these cartoons I found them to be very enjoyable but my son of 3 years old is turned on to Superman big time now. It's alot of fun hunging out with my son and watching his reaction to the cartoons for the first time. It's funny watching him play Superman and then beating me up. I would give it a 5 star rating but there is still room for improvement with the picture and sound. So buy it and enjoy it with your family.
1,Messing with a classic,"Despite having reasonably good video (for a public domain release), the audio has been ""enhanced"" by the manufacturer. In other words, they've added sound effects in addition to the original soundtrack (and occasionally over it). One can certainly understand issues with the opening and closing credits, given the ownership changes of these old cartoons, but crassly adding sound effects is akin to sacriledge. Do yourself a favor and wait for a better public domain release or a full restoration by Warner Bros."
1,Must Love Actionscript,"I will atest that this is a great book IF you are an actionscript junkie, but if your not you will hate this book. I was looking for a book to help my students with thier Flash animations and this book was way beyond where I wanted to take my students."
2,This Book is Hardly Useful in Practice,"The only part I like about this book is the description of Flash coordinate system. From chapter to chapter, there is nothing in it but a red little ball moving around. I am not sure what is the point."
3,Too many details,"My fifth grade students were bored when I read this book to them. They are very interested in the rock cycle, however, this book presented information that went on forever. I think it would have been better if it could have been more concise."
3,"First, the good news....(see update)","(Update): Since there is now an image, Amazon must have received a new shipment that is not made up of the 'seconds' it was shipping to customers last month. Perhaps the purchaser will be lucky enough to actually discern the image.(Original): Nicely packaged, inexpensive and made in England.Now, the Bad:It is unsurprising an image is not available. These sandwich trays (I purchased 3) are all seconds. The scene depicted is Broadway, NYC. You have to use your imagination, though. Try to think of a copy that has been run on a printer low on ink and you have an idea of how indistinct this depiction is.I rated this 3 stars primarily because of the $6.99 price. I would not think of paying more for such poor quality."
4,Some of his better polkas,"The songs are some of the old favorites the way only Marion Lush could play them. The sound quality on a few songs was not the best, but overall it was worth the price. Wish I could find more of his recordings."
5,Great Polkaz and Waltzes,Lovely music cheerful and romantic whether in English or Polish. What a fun album.
2,bad,This prduct used to be made very well and worked so good.Now its made poorly and cheap and everytime I scoop litter it rips a hole and the litter goes right into the box anyway.I dont know what happen but I used to love them and now it is more work cleaning up and just not worth it.
3,comedy content,cant recall for sure if i saw this episode but did like most of them cant remember much comedy in them however memory not to good sometimes +_)(*&^%$#@!~9876543210...
4,H-pylori,"I was diagnosed with H-pylori and could not handle the three band antibiotic treatment (too many side-effects). I was desperate and in search of something natural. So far I have been taking mastic gum (solaray) in the morning before meals, along with Bio-HPF, garlic pill and lauricidin (for the biofilm), I also take it again at night. I hope all this works...one thing is a fact it does help soothe my stomach and allow me to sleep. I do not know if mastic gum alone works for pylori, it all depends the severity of your condition; plus there is some controversy on it. However, I will find out, my partner is taking only mastic gum everymorning, he feels good (thus far). My partner has not been tested, but I see some symptoms that make me believe he is a carrier. He will get tested next week. So far I am following the advice of Dr. Ettinger[...]Good luck to everyone, who is fighting this nasty bacteria..."
3,Good design for my needs.,"I noticed a crack after assembly. Was sent a replacement part. Instructions state that ""unable to take apart after assembly"". Unable to use replacement part. Have a nice recycling bin with a crack in the front now and a part that I cannot use.Would not deal with company again, nor recommend."
5,This is exactly what we wanted,"I have a 2 person household, and this fits all our recyclables perfectly and with enough room. We have three animals, and they each get a can of food a day, and we could go 2 weeks at least with filling up just the bottom bin and have enough room. It is much nicer looking than many other bins and is very functional. One of the bins was cracked when it arrived, I went through customer support and had a new bin within days. They were awesome to work with. I highly recommend this!"
4,This works well and is a great organizer,We recycle a lot of paper and plastic. Being a family of 4 we go through a lot food. Throw in a newspaper subcription and you've got a lot of stuff. This is a great way to keep things neet and organzied and doesn't look half bad standing in teh corner. It is sturdy and easy to put together. I did not give it 5 stars because it needs to be a bit bigger.
5,Perfect! A nice low-key item that blends into the kitchen.,"I'd been searching for a couple of months and it was so hard to find a recycle bin set that sorted recylables, wasn't in bright primary colors or was too big/small for the space. The 3 drawers are simple to pull out and dump into the outside recycle containers and are not an eyesore in the corner of my kitchen. We've had it for about 2 months now and are still happy with the product."
4,"Good Product, could have bigger bins","Received product in excellent condition from Amazon, put it together easy. Only complaint is that the bins arent as big as i would have like. They get filled up pretty quick, but, overall I'm happy with the purchase."
3,I like it but.......,"I was very excited to get this but when I did, I opened the box and immediately had to wipe it down because it was dirty.. then as I put it together (easy to assemble) I notice one of the pieces was CRACKED!!!!I have to glue it together and the once I was finished, I noticed that one of the small handles was missing!!! I was a little frustrated but I could not find a telephone number on the website to contact customer service so my husband and I decided to just live with it. We like the product and it serves it's purpose."
1,recycle bin,"The bins were very small and could not be used for the intended purpose, weekly recycling, unless you don't recycle much. My daughter ended up using it for dogfood storage and other mudroom accessories."
1,Two of them arrived broken,"Good in theory. The tall stacking does save space. The off white plastic is more acceptable than many of this type of item I have seen. The first set of Bins arrived with the side panel broken. The box did not appear to be damaged in shipment. After some mis-communication on part of Stacks and Stacks, we finally received the second set of Bins, only to find once again the plastic had a long crack in it. We were able to glue it together and will live with it, but at the cost of $75 (with shipping) I would say, don't waste your money."
2,Entirely too Small of a Product,"To be simple and concise... This Tower is entirely too small for its intended purpose. It would be a better product should the item be twice the width, no so much the height, but the bins themselves are not sized large enough to fit say 3 sunday newspapers/bin. Cans and bottle are OK... if stacked properly inside the bin it is possible to fit an 18 pack of soda cans...bottles maybe 12 pack. Great idea for a single person with a small apartment..but for a family wouldnt be the best fit..."
5,This book blasts off!,"I love this book! I have to admit it's not as good as Harry Potter. This book is funny and very well written. I love when Jesse goes after Togopie(sorry I know I spelled it wrong) and when they get trapped in the basement. Ash really lucks out in this one (it has to do with Persin). Team Rockets boss leaves them with the tempory job of gym leader. This story tells you why and how they joined team rocket. Plus, the battle in the end is pretty cool."
4,blast off! otn,i like this book {kind of}.i got it only 4 1 cent.this book has 4 episodes. this book looks to the passt of all the peoples of teamrockets favorite memories on tri'ne to catch pikachu. if you have olready read the books befor this then do not get this book.
5,Memories,"Go, Team Rocket, Go! I think JAMES iS THE MOST handsome member of Team Rocket. Sometimes he is cool and relaxed."
4,a really awsome book,I think this is a really awsome book.I think every one should like it. I would recomend it to any body.
5,C-D2 engine delailor,"I use to buy this stuff at auto zone for about 3.99 a can and then it went to 4.99 then 5.99 then auto zone used the same bar code but it came out as black magic engine detailor and cleaner in one. this stuff was not worth crap and they discontinued the good stuff, C-D2 and cant find it anywere else but the internet....THIS STUFF IS AWSOME, Iv been using it for years, it will make your engine ready for show, just remember you have to use somthing like gunk engine degreaser first or even stp eng degre...ogh cant find that anymore either....Later..........."
4,Good Stuff,Best engine detail spray out there. To bad Midway charges way to much for it and I can't find it anywhere locally...
4,Every person's e-security handbook,Finally a book on e-business and home computing security that the average person can read and enjoy. Highly recommended if you are spending any time on-line.
4,A Great Fast-Paced Thriller,"I read this thriller in one setting.A none-stop romp right to the ending!Excellent ""who-done-it"" pulp.LaMonte Heflick, author Pup Fiction(TM) Books"
2,a horrendous book,"If you want to get overly depressed, this is the book for you. the illistratoins have blood, guts, fighting, and other seans that are overly depressing. this book shoes cruelty to animals. the book does deathning experiments on the animals. Some of Its experements are prying dogs mouths open until they bleed, or cutting animals' vocal cords so they can't cry when they are doing other experiments. I relized that this book is trying to point out that cruelty to animals is happenning, but this bookis very disturbing and out of a dark place!"
1,Hyperbolic animal rights fantasies gone wild,"Sue Coe has no equal but is beloved by animal rights radicals for her jaundiced, human-hating view of life on earth. To her all humans are evil and savage, even the good people are tainted. All animals are innocent victims tortured by humanity. What's scary is not what you see in Sue Coe's overheated imagery, but the fact that many young people are captivated by her gothic vision and take it for gospel truth. The stereotypical caricatures of dog fighters are a joke. We all know that every animal abuser goes on to hurt people, too. Right. Whatever. Sue Coe really despises people, and that's sad. She invokes just about every animal rights cause in this small book, including a feverish slam at deer hunting, which seemed totally gratuitous and unwarranted in a book supposedly focussing on pit bulls. I got this book from Amazon because I own a pit bull. I knew better than to expect a fair and balanced picture from Sue Coe, though."
1,USELESS DRIBBLE,"Nothing but stereotypical bull plop. If you really want to know anything about the breed read any of Richard Stratton's books, they are pretty good. This book and the ""author's"" views are scandalous (scandal sell my friend) at best and a great disservice to these noble creatures and the responsible owner of this breed who has to put up with the prejudices or our society. Beleive it or not, not all pitbull owners are dirt bags or lowlifes."
5,very helpful and great strategy guide,"I almost always buy strategy guides with games i buy. So when i bought this game the day it came out, i bought the strategy guide. This is one of the most helpful strategy guides i have had the privelage of spending 14 bucks on. Its divided into 4 sections, with the 4 worlds you have in the game. THere is a list of characters, guns, etc... and great maps and guides to help you get through the game. There arent any Gameshark cheats and no other kind of cheats i can find on the internet right now, so forking out the 14 bucks for this strategy guide may be the right thing to do in this situation. The game itself is great- and they do a great job with this strategy guide in telling you all about what to do."
1,pointless,allright what was the point in making this thing? it doesnt tell you anything that the little book that came with the game does. And the mission section of this book just restates what they tell you in the game. Its basically a waste of money so dont buy it.
4,Pleased,"Excellent replacement seals, very easy install and nearly factory-perfect fit! My Skylark's doors close tight again and I'm very pleased with the look & feel of the black foam rubber. Nice and soft as it should be"
4,Too Late The Hero,"Recorded and then stuck in a vault for a decade, this side project by Judas Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton is pure old-school; a power trio with two rock legends, John Entwistle (b) and Cozy Powell (d), with material that finds each musician comfortably working within the pared-down format.Tipton handles the vocals - there are 11 tracks - with Give Blood leading the way. Entwistle emerges from the mix to deliver a strong performance on Walls Cave In, while a snappy keyboard intro leads into the solid The Holy Man. A ballad - Searching - nearly steals the show and is a subtle artistic statement by Tipton.That the tracks gathered dust says it all about a music industry that seemingly gets befuddled when ""classic"" rock stars don't rehash old material and then cannot be jammed into a tired FM format."
5,Wow...,"Ok, so i found both of Glenn's solo cds on bmg music, and said, screw it, if he is playing the guitar on any cd, i have to have it. so I bought them both. out of the two, Edge of the World is my favorite. excellent guitar and bass work, awesome vocals, just good songwriting. When i listened to the Baptizm of Fire cd, it seemed to me that he was kind of trying to do the whole death and doom metal vocals, with the growling and slight voice altering. even though, it has an awesome guitar intrumental song on there. all over awesome music."
5,Great work from great musicians.,"I wish I could talk to the cretin at Atlantic who turned down the album. Thanks to them we have all this s*** pouring out everywhere nova days. The album is interesting , heavy and brilliantly performed. Vocals are fine. Mr. Tipton did a great job to conceal the lack of vocal power by some interesting approach. In one song he even reminded me of Steve Harley singing ""Somebody Called Me Sebastian"". The powerful singer on solo album is not necessary a great thing since it will draw the vision aside. I am very happy I have it now. Thank You, Sir, Glenn."
4,Good Stuff,"I really like this album, I'll normally whisk threw a CD and hash out the songs that immediately grab me.The song on this album is Resolution, it was cool the first time around, after tearing it apart several times over I'd have to say this song kicks major butt.This is a solid release."
2,judas,not much to say about this cd .the guitar playing is great the singing is crappy and the drums and bass are okay very disapointed
3,Vocals lost in the mix but good music,"I wanted to love this CD. What a cool line up Tipton from Priest, Entwistle from The Who and Cozy Powell. I love the guitar sound and song structure, however I feel the vocals get lost in the mix and do not have much diversity (it is Tipton signing). If you are a die-hard fan of these guys you will like it. If you want Entwistle's bass playing buy ""Who's Next"", if you want Tipton's guitar by the new Priest ""Angel of Retribution"" if you love Cozy Powell pick up Black Sabbath's ""Headless Cross"". Enjoy."
2,Has Some Merit,"It is indeed true that MOST of the tracks on this album are re-records, and this is certainly both annoying and unforgivable. However, there is one original: ""Sugar Baby Love"" by the fabledRubettes. This album is worth the price for that track alone!"
4,This book is OK,"The book has good content. I would like it more if it had a case study or some real life examples. One thing I didn't like was the answer key. It did not give you the answers, but it gave you the page where to find it. For the price they charge, I would expect all the above to be in the book. I did get a 36/40 in the exam, so it was helpful."
2,Not as nice as I hoped it would be,"The first thing I noticed was that the borders around every card are grey. It's like a pale, dingy grey. Like the color of a utility truck. It matches nothing in the cards at all and it makes the cards rather unappealing. The second thing that I did not like was the cream color they used for the backs of all the cards. It's just one solid color that again does not match the cards and I found the color choice quite confusing.Also this deck isn't really a ""playing"" deck. It's too big to do much with."
2,A Disappointment,"I looked forward to receiving this deck, but it turned out to be a miserable edition... The cards are huge - why so huge??? The quality of reproductions is poor, soapy. It is a great pity that the edition that could have been simply breathtaking was carried out with such ineptness. The ugly grey border and the wretched back of the cards are better not to mention at all. I will keep this deck for reference, but I'll be awaiting a new, proper edition. ... (a deep sigh)..."
4,local heros,"First and foremost an academic publication, MAKING THE LOCAL NEWS is now something of a definitive tome for all those involved in what Franklin describes as 'the original grass roots of the press'. Franklin and co have managed the unenviable task of writing a broad spectred account of this hugh area of modern journalism while giving the reader enough depth of perspective to make the whole process worthwhile. In short, it is macrocosm in microcosm; and easily the most quotable book available on this fascinating subject."
3,Disappointing for my purposes,"Identified by its title as an atlas of American History, it was disappointing to see the emphasis on 20th Century wars. Fully half of the book was on this. Everything through the colonial period was completed in 36 pages. Where is a great atlas on colonial America?"
1,Not the original DANA material / these are re-recordings for dyno,"Although I'm thankful something came out on CD by Frank, these are not the recordings which made him famous."
2,"Cute, but Not Practical","Although this is an attractive item, it's too large and takes up a lot of room at the top of the golf bag. At the same time, despite it's size, it's not designed very well on the inside to accommodate a club. It's always falling off. I wouldn't recommend this item."
5,a tight azz album,"if you love fast lyric singing rappers, then you will love this album. I like them even better than Bone. Pick up do or die's new one ""Headz or tailz."" That's a phat album too. But personally I would rather have twista's ""Adrenaline Rush."" Go pick up this CD if you want a rapper who sings with do or die and who can bust lyrics."
3,Po Pimpers for LIFE!,"Out of all the songs there were a few that was lame, but there were a lot snaping out of the hook."
4,Good Shiat,This is an awesome cd it's got some tight rythems. It's kinda old school rap but hey old school rap is cool soo.I really liked it the first time i listened to it. Buy this cd it's damn good
1,this is junk,"You call this music? A sick dog barking with some kid smashing sticks into a tree trunk would sound better than this ""easy listening"" garbage. Rap... what a waste of CD space. Do or Die epitomizes that."
4,WEST SIDE CHI-TOWN !!!,"DO OR DIE FIRST ALBUM,IT IS SHORT BUT IS VERY GOOD.MY FAVORITE TRACK IS #8 ""6 MILLION WAYS TO DIE"".THE BEAT IS LIKE NO OTHER,TRAX THE MAN WHO MADE THE BEATS ON THIS ALBUM IS THE TIGHTEST IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.THIS ALBUM IS THE BOMB,I DON'T LISTEN TO IT MUCH ANYMORE BUT I STILL LOVE IT.DO OR DIE FO-LIFE , BETTER THAN BONE THUGS ALL DAY EVERYDAY."
3,not 2 bad,"I would give it 5 stars but it didnt have enough songs and 3/4 of tha songz r good anywayz. but 6 Million iz definitely tha tighest song i`ve ever heard in my life. Belo-Zero flowz like i`ve never heard in my life, it juz soudnz so good. i recommend gettin it because of thiz song and a couple otherz."
2,"An irregular book, with a short end for too long a novel.","Such a disapointment! This novel has quite a few weak points that a veteran science fiction writer should not allow themselves, the narration is a bit jumpy, with a varying degree of detail being assigned to unexpected aspects, and some technical details look weird (that is, different from the expected and not explained by any alleged futuristic developments). The ending is not ellaborated enough, which makes you feel even more that the rest of the novel was too long for such a climax. This is the first novel by Robert Silverberg that I read and it does not show me where all the good qualities of this author resides. BTW, does anybody know what the author intention could be in going all that way (at some points the sentences felt forced) to deprive the year-captain from a normal name? And has anyone figured out whether there is any relationship between the ""angels"" (I don't want to spoil the end) and the psychic powers of Planet A?"
2,"Engaging planets, disappointing ending","The first two-thirds of this book were intriguing, and as the crew discovered and explored planets, I was on the edge of my seat in suspense. The ending, however, is just plain stupid. Silverberg takes a crewmember's random guess and builds it into a non-believable and unrelated second plot line that finishes the book far too rapidly and unsatisfyingly."
4,Wonderfully tight novel,"If the last few pages of this well written book do not heighten your sense of wonder, you shouldn't read real SF. Stick to your weak novels made from TV shows. I was kissing the book after I finished. It was a very tight book. You felt as if in a dream state throughout. You could feel the harshness of the metal surrounding the crew. You could feel the Year-Captain's confusion. A beautiful piece of art. Not by any means the greatest, but not one to scorn. Silverberg is my favorite author, and this book was great art."
1,Disappointing,"Silverberg is one of my favorite authors, but this book seems to have none of the fascinating ideas and images that have kept me reading his books again and again. The story seems to drag on with no real point, just a lot of fluff separating the meager action scenes (which weren't very captivating). I found myself skimming over many a paragraph looking for some real substance. If Silverberg hadn't been the author I would have quit reading after the first ten pages. Unfortunately I kept going and was disappointed. I hate to say it but I don't recommend this book to anyone."
5,My opinion of the book.,"Robert Silverbrg is so able to establish a sense of wonder in us. 'Starborne' moves at a speed of light pace that is so pleasant.Throughout the book , we are towards strange new worlds and cvilisation. It is almost as if we too are aboard the ' Wotan'..."
3,MURDER CITY REVISITED,"I grew up in the Detroit during the 50's, 60's, part of the 70's. i would recommend it for anyone who grew up in that era. i enjoyed the footage shown from that time-it brought back memories. if anything, the makers of this film could do a film on each of the subjects mentioned in the film-it's an overview but it's like you get a tantalizing bite of a topic and then they move on. one topic they mention-the death of a persian gulf vet named riggs. they make his murder sound like part of a social problems of detroit when actually he was murdred by those closest to him-his wife and her brother. that could have happened anywhere and i am surprised they did not mention the outcome in the film. other than that, it was interesting."
3,good for quick reference,"i got this dvd to use for reference and hoped that it had details of many of the major crimes that had taken place in detroit, especially since the 1970's. i didn't find it very detailed. it was rather slap dash with many of the stories, particularly in more recent times. when there were words to be read on screen, they came and went so quickly, you had to rewind a couple of times just to read what was said. this dvd is amatuerish, including the sensationalistic voice over. it is good for a single viewing. expensive too, for what you get."
1,Not an accurate depiction,"To portray Detroit as some death trap is just awful. I was born and raised in the Detroit, and my parents were here in the 50's, and they have said, to me, It was not bad like that, and they grew up in Black bottom and the east side. Music was in the air and love. However in the 80's which was my time, I remember YBI, and yes they were ruthless, but we had good times too. Family was still there, and jobs, so tell the whole story, I'm tired of the bad rap in Detroit. We may not have all the finances, but we have heart."
4,Not a textbook to sell back,"All right. Granted, this book is used by many universities as a textbook for modern literature. Despite the stigma that implies, this is a very worthwhile read. It offers a good cross section of literature from asian to africa. (the african poem ""the mulatta and the minotaur"" by lorna goodison is a very good example of the quality of work presented) I recommend this for anyone looking to expand their appreciation of literature outside the western world."
5,fun planets!,"This is another 300-piece puzzle I purchased for my four-year-old daughter who needed more challenging puzzles... This along with ""End of an Era"" have been a great way for her to expand her puzzle piecing skills, as well as feed her interest in science ~ the planets in this case. When broken down into planets, she's able to do the puzzle by herself and really enjoys learning about the different things in space. Same as with ""End of an Era"", this puzzle is more challenging due to the way the picture is cut into pieces... Also, the same as the other Melissa & Doug puzzles we've purchased, some pieces need to be glued (top to the bottom cardboard) as it comes apart with every construction/breakdown. It's just what it is... Overall, very pleased with the puzzle."
3,Chair and ottoman sets,"I bought two of these sets. They are pretty, but much smaller than I ever would have thought. Almost look miniature, like for a teen's room. Small, but usable."
3,Not what I expected,I really like the chair but was expecting it to have a taller back. The quality is okay but the bottom covering started to rip apart as I screwed on the legs. I was mostly disappointed that this style chair does not come with a higher back.
2,Wheels won't stay on the track,"There is something wrong with this car, it won't stay on the track. It falls off everytime it goes around a curve. We are going to return it."
3,These stakes are too short,"These stakes are very well made, but way to short. They need to come in a triple length option for very wet ground use. I ended up having to make stakes from local wood and limbs in a length that would work.The stakes in this length will only be good for very dry and compacted ground.Price and S&H; were good."
2,"Ordered a kit, rec'd one piece.",I will never know if these work or not. I paid $20 for the kit and they sent a single stake. I immediately emailed them and never heard from them. Then the return window expired. Awesome.
5,MSR Ground Hog Stake Kit,"Arrived quickly, used once time and so far, they worked great. Also light weight."
4,My go to stakes,"These stakes are my go to stakes for everyday camping. These things are built really tough. They stay where you put them and are nice and easy to get into the ground. They are certainly not as light as Ti spikes, but not much heavier either. The pull out cords make it easy to get them out of tough soil."
4,"nice very smooth,and ruff","this one will be his best for ever...no matter how many albums he drop,also a must by for those who dont have it."
5,i luv shyheim and want to hear from him.,i can really vibe off the album. this is the kind of track that has something for everyone. it is also the kind of track you can just let play.
3,"One joke, but a well-executed one","This collection of pieces from the book of the same title is a bit limited in its appeal, and grows tiresome at times; one wishes he would expand the scope of his satire beyond the navel-gazing of modern literary non-fiction. But even if the humor is a bit repetitious, at least it's funny. ""I Am Friends With a Working Class Black Woman"" makes the entire CD worthwhile, with the bourgeois reporter befriending his subject, only to be forced to endure the casual homophobia of the WB. The Pine Valley Cosmonauts' soundtrack, while sometimes sounding more like Ken Burns documentary than NPR, generally fits the mood well. This isn't Neal Pollack's very best, but still worth a listen."
4,Holding out,"7 and up might really mean 7 and up on this one. My children are 6 & 4, They LOVE Ben 10. But when the 4 of us sat down to play this game it was tough. We packed it up and will try again in a few months."
2,Booooring!,"I got this for my 5 year old who is almost 6 and a fanatic of Ben 10, and even though it's recommended for 6-99 year olds, I thought that with my help we would enjoy playing this board game.Oh! to my disappointment I was terribly bored by it. I love playing board games but the whole premise of the game was quite ""blah"". The istructions are the kind you need to read more than twice to completely understand where things go and how to play. The cardboard pieces were folded and worn out by the end of the month. My son put it away and hasn't asked for it since."
2,Fun but junky,"The toy concept is cool, but already 3 pieces have broken, and after assembly the new alien flys off the base and break apart. My son has taken to just playing with the aliens and forgetting about the creator....skip this one"
1,"Hard to play, doesn't hold kids interest","Despite loving Ben 10, my three boys do not enjoy this game. The monsters and pieces are fine, but the game itself is boring. LIke most Ben 10 toys, it is not very good. Packaging gets it sold but the product is lousy."
1,"""Don't Bother""","An amateurish, plodding and coma-inducing tale that possesses little or no bite. In fact, it's filled with lots of down time, a tedious ""mystery"", and impenetrable ""secret codes"". Unless you're the type who likes to use the word, ""Dude,"" in every other sentence, this one will not appeal to you."
2,Not as good as her first two!,"I had never heard of Gennita Low before, and I read her first books with some trepidation, but she proved she was a really great writer. But, in this book she really disappointed me. I read all the other reviews and I thought the book was going to be great. Nope, didn't happen. It started good and went downhill from there. The last hundred pages picked up but not to warrant such rave reviews from so many people. The book was bad, too much action between secondary characters, and not enough between Jazz and Vivi. Skip this book in her series, go on to The Hunter instead, much more interesting."
2,Could Have Been Better,"Some people really loved this book, but I'm not one of them. This is my first Gennita Low book but I'll need to read another to give her a fair chance. Ms. Low needed to let the actions of her characters carry more of the plot and not feel like she has to explain everything - please, less cumbersome explanation about the many secret agencies and terrorist cells would have been better. I found myself having to re-read pages after losing interest and daydreaming (there are a lot of sub-plots and characters that weren't that engaging)... I made myself finish the book. To her credit,the plot does give a voice to those exploited children in the world that need help and those groups that are trying to do it."
3,content,"just didn't like the subjects, couldn't get into this book. selling girls, drugs not where I enjoy getting away to when I read."
2,Kinda slow,This book was slow. I could not get past chapter 9. I did like the three main characters esp Jazz and Viv but could not get into the story.
3,Erotic romance suspense story on a mission,"Protector (Crossfire)This was a somewhat confusing story about navy seals, and a female counter part organization called Gem. I thought these women were going to be kick ass. Although they were good at disguises, Vivi was a bit of a disappointment. The secondary story about Stephan and Lis was weird because it was mostly very detailed long sex scenes with no background and an explanation that made no sense. I was confused between Stephan and Hawk as undercover agents. Then when the story should have ended, it morphs into a long preachy campaign against forced child prostitution. The subject is important and needs attention but not so much in an over the top erotic romance novel."
3,Slow to start,"It took a while to ease into the book, but once it was well into the book it became difficult to put down."
3,"Not a waste of time, some interesting plot twists","The story line was good. The author addresses a taboo subject and actually makes me want to read more in the way on non-fiction on child trafficking. Jazz wasn't one of my favorite heroes and while I did enjoy Vivi's ability to blend and change, she didn't leave me loving her, either. One thing did bother me - there were so many references to previous stories that I haven't (and probably won't) read, that I was occasionally feeling in the dark about some of the plot.Yes, the typos run me crazy but if I like a book I can get over that issue. Some of the sex scenes were extraneous, but I don't read for the sex. In a couple of cases, they were actually furthering the plot.I do have the second book in the series and will go ahead and read it because this one isn't horrible. I do not, however, have great expectations of a wonderful story, just a good ""take me away from here"" story.I don't feel as if this book were a waste of time."
5,"Action, Adventure, Explosions and Hot Love Scenes","What more could you ask for from this third-in-the-series action-romance? It's a keeper! Ms. Low has combined fast-moving, high-intesity action scenes, with the sizzling love scenes we've come to expect from her previous books. The men are hot and the heroines are worthy (and visa-a-vis). Add it to your list of ""Buy it now's""...you won't be disappointed!"
3,Very difficult storyline to get into,"I really really wanted to like this book more than I did. But being a retired socialworker, my real world experience could not be turned off. The hero is very cool and so is the heroine, but the storyling they had to work in was a real turn off for me. It is a noble attempt at conscience raising. But I purchased the book to be entertained.I would recommed instead: ""Warrior Soul"" by Chuck Pfarrer. His biography of his eight years of being a Navy SEAL. It is a very civilian reader friendly, biography. He is very honest about his private conduct and does not make his book a grenade throwing guy fest."
4,Good but Not as Good as The Ohers!,Of all four books this was the only one I wasn't as crazy over. Jazz fell for ViVi so fast I couldn't beleive it as at first I thought she was considered just ordinary. Have to admit though those SEALS were all nice guys. Couldn't help but love em all. I would recommend all the books in the series and hope she continues to add to them.
1,advertised incorrectly,These are not the artists that made the songs famous. It is advertised incorrectly. Very deceptive. Poor imitation. I would rate this CD a 0
4,Versitile swing,"First, assembly is not too bad though the instructions could be a bit more detailed.The tray is certainly unnecessary early on but will be handy later. The seat is pretty adjustable and seemingly comfortable for the youngster, this is our third.I like the variation in swing settings and the addition of vibration if desired. The sounds are OK but we don't really use them much.The only con for me is that it is a little noisy though I've not really found any swings of this type that are much better.It seems to be well made an durable. Don't have a good read yet on battery life but will try to update later.So far, so good."
1,Such a disappointment!,"When my son was about a month old the songs started going out of tune. Even though the swing was still swinging just fine, we changed out the batteries to see if it would help. It didn't. Now he's two months old and the music is so bad it's painful to hear so we don't use it. Also, what is the point of this mobile? It doesn't move at all, and it's so far away from our child that he can't see it. Even if it was within his sight range, the colors are light pastels so he still wouldn't be able to see them. Also, something isn't right with our power button. We can push a number for the swing speed and it work fine, but we have a really hard time turning it off. There has to be a better swing out there! This one is just terrible!"
2,Meh,"I was not able to figure out why the space under the tray is so limited.. there is no room for baby's legs under the plastic edges! So I took off the tray completely. Our baby didn't like the swing anyway, so it's up on Craigslist now."
3,Good,"We have the Graco stroller in Theresa and I liked what I read about the swing, so I got it. The swing is really nice and my two month old seems to like it. We had to take the tray off, however, (of course, we don't use it anyway) since it is almost impossible to open. You need both hands (and feet) to open this. I don't know if it is just our swing or if they are all like this. The stroller has a really nice little lever that you just pull and then lift the tray - with one hand, why not just use the same idea for the swing?"
2,Takes too long to get infant into 5-point harness,"Swings will calm a baby that is wailing. But the problem with this swing is that it is way too difficult, and takes way too long, to get my crying baby into the 5-point harness. It is awful.When the swing finally does put the little guy to sleep, opening the swing always results in a slight ""thud"" that wakes him up and re-starts the crying.We received this swing as a gift. I would not purchase it."
1,911 DRUGSTORE MISLEADING!!,"This is the second baby product on sale by 911DrugStore that I've seen where the image does not match the description!!!I wanted to do a price comparison for this swing, and this is NOT the Lexington print by Graco, this is their Darius print."
1,Terrible Swing,I received this swing as a gift and it worked great for the first week we had it. After the first week the swing just stopped swinging. I thought it was the batteries but replaced them and tested the old ones and they were fine. My daughter was only 12 pounds so that wasn't the problem either. I am now using it as a place for her to nap because I can't return it.
2,Good for one child.,"I recieved this swing at my baby shower for my first. I loved it. It put together fine and We used it daily. When my son was about 20 pounds I decided to put him in his swing while I did something, and noticed the swing part wasn't working. I didn't really worry cause I figured the batterties were dying or he just weighed to much, so I put it into storage.I am expecting my second baby now, and I took the swing out and bought new batteries for it. I decided to get it running seeing as I am due in 4 weeks. Well, much to my suprise the swing part is broken. The music works fine, but I found that the weight of just the swing itself is to much for the motor to handle and makes a LOUD clunking sound like it's dying. When I take the swing part off it continues to make the clunking sound but the part where you connect the actual swing to the base will swing. So needless to say, I need a new swing for baby #2."
2,More CONs than PROs,"Pro's: large selection of music; nice multi-incline of seat; lots of swing speeds with timer featureCon's: Tray extremely difficult to open; nature sounds are terrible (you can't even tell they're naturistic);mobile is pretty useless (too high and too small);shoulder harness/strap TOO SHORT - my daughter is 7 mosold and ~18 lbs and the shoulder strap is already too short. I contactedGraco and they sent me a replacement seat with the exact same shoulderstraps (i.e TOO short). If your baby is over 17 lbs and 26"" long, thenhe/she will barely be able to be strapped in using the shoulder straps.Currently trying to get them to send me LONGER shoulder straps."
5,Perfect,"Bought a different swing....my 2 month old hated it. Got this one, she loves it...she swings for hours and it's very quite"
3,Depends on your baby,"We got this swing as a gift. As a newborn my daughter freaked out in it, but around 5 months old started to like it. Now I can put her in it when she doesn't want to settle down for a nap and she falls asleep in it. The straps are a little tricky because they're 5 pieces that you have to clip together, unlike a car seat where there are only 3.Although it's rated to 30 pounds, height is really a limiting factor. My baby is only 6 months old and already the shoulder straps are really pulling to get them latched in, and she's only 17 pounds. I started just doing the waist belt, but have to keep a very close eye to make sure she doesn't flip out if she starts to squirm. They need to make the shoulder straps longer or else add additional holes to loop them through for a taller child."
4,Great Swing,"This is a really useful model - especially the ability to recline the seat, it has a vibration mode, and it has pillow inserts so that even newborn heads don't roll around. The only reason not to give it 5 stars, is like all Graco Open Top models for some reason the tray is open underneath so little feet push against the inner lip of the tray and get scratched with no socks or caught. I wish Graco would add a peice to close off/fill in the underneath of the tray."
3,ok,"this swing has alot of sounds, but the nature ones dont even sound good at all. the front tray is very very hard to get up. my daughter has fallen asleep in it only a couple times. the pattern is cute."
2,average,"maybe 3 songs dont get annoying. another inconsistent album, the cutthroat committee should stick together (props 2 dubee and mac dre for solid solo albums--)"
3,"Great photos, horrible text.","I'm surprised that Booklist calls the text of this book ""witty and informative."" I found the text to be the major weakness of the book. It's vague, rambling, and completely UNinformative. I didn't learn about Beene's background, education, training, or business. All I got was a lot of fashion-speak garble about his brilliance and genius. The writing is just really, really bad.The most interesting part of the book is the final section, which is entirely quotes from Beene himself. The photos are lovely, but 120 is too few to give a good overview of Beene's work; he has been designing for 30+ years and must have designed hundreds or even thousands of garments by now. This book shows too few of them.Overall, this book was disappointing."
3,Focus issues,"I've had this lens for about two years and it's served me OK (for the price).This lens has focus issues. I can't recall if it's always been like that or if it got like that lately. The point is, had I known that I would be somewhat unhappy with it just 2 years after purchase, I would have saved my money and gotten a Cannon instead."
5,Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8,This lens far surpast my expectations. I would definitely recommend this lens to anyone shooting indoor sports or any portraits.
3,No where close to the same in Canon,"I bought this lens for a wedding based on the good reviews and the fact that it will get down to 2.8. I have also used the Canon L lens and a Sigma lens, both roughly the same features. While the lens is fine, it's no where close to my Canon lenses. Canon's are so much crisper and more clear at all ranges. Overall this lens is okay but just that, okay.The lens feels cheap and very plastic. The focus is very quiet even though it is not an ultrasonic motor. Turning the zoom is stiff and also feels like plastic rubbing on plastic. The photos I took came out fine and I did appreciate the wide aperture. Next time I'll remind myself to stick with Canon.In the end I'd say this lens is decent for everyday use and much better than other within it's price range. I think Tamron needs to rethink some parts of it and then they'll have a true winner."
5,Love this lens over canon's l series,"A great lens for the more serious photographer, achieving the highly sought after f stop of 2.8 and with image stabilization. A great choice for those that don't enjoy spending twice as much to have a white canon L series lens!"
2,Fails to freeze motion,"This lens just fails to freeze motion, even though you are using a higher shutter speed. Also, the white balance is off on most occasions. If your subject is moving even a little bit, then your image will turn out to be blurry. 95% of my images turned out to be blurry. The rest 5% were extremely sharp. F2.8 was unusable."
3,envisionphotoinc,"You get what you pay for. The lens does a good job in low lighting. I prefer to stick with Canon lens, due to the quality and reliability."
4,Good fast lens,"This lens is a good alternative to a comparative Canon lens. Although it dosen't have IS or USM it's performance is good. I can't find a canon lens that can compare for the money.**Update**After having this lens for over a year now, I am very pleased with the results from this lens. This lens is acceptably sharp in the corners on my APS-C digital at f/2.8, but on my film camera I can't get it to clean up in the corners until f/4. So i'd still suggest this lens for the money compared to the Canon 24-70L. Hopefully Tamron will add VC (IS) to this lens as they have to their17-50mm f/2.8."
3,It's OK,"After reading many positive reviews, I purchased this lens. On a budget, I was looking for a zoom to replace my kit lens and loved the f/2.8 aperture. At 28mm, this lens is fantastic, very sharp, fast focus. Zoom any higher than that and images get more and more blurry, even on a tripod! Dissappointed, I sent in my lens for repair which cost me $24. I received it back today and it seems there is no difference in image quality. I wonder if they even looked at it? Honestly, my kit lens produces better quality images, it just doesn't have the low aperture I want. I will continue to use this lens until I can afford real Canon glass, but only at 28mm. I would never offer an image to a customer taken in the upper zoom ranges. I would have been better off buying a wide angle prime lens. If you're NOT a photographer, you'd probably love this lens. The bokeh (blur) is nice but if sharpness is something you need, stick with prime lenses."
5,Great Lens,Good lens. Great pics and clarity. Solid feel and good addition to my collection of lenses. Will be using it as my prime lens.Bharesh Dedhia
2,fuzzy,"I really wanted to like this lens and on a independant product site on lenses this had a good review. Some others on amazon have rated it highly. The lens certainly has a solid build on all exterior surfaces. I tested the lens outdoors in sunlight, cloudy days, indoors with and without a flash. I shot with a variety of shutter speeds, f-stops, and modes. In the end though when looking at images at 1:1 the were unacceptably soft. The images may have been OK for the web or small prints, but for a lens in this price range I was expecting more. The time estimate for the lens to be recalibrated was longer than I wished to wait. I may have received a lens with QA problems or some other type of processing problem. I am currently looking at other lenses."
3,"Sharp, but...","I owned the original version of this lens seven or eight years ago, and was very happy with it. So when I upgraded to a full-frame Nikon D3, this was my first choice for a ""normal"" lens.While it was a good performer generally, it exhibited some truly horrible flare under arena lighting; since I primarily shoot sports, this was an unacceptable flaw for me."
3,Good Beginner Zoom,"I've had the Tamron lens for about a year now. When I first got it I was thrilled with the bokeh, color, and quality of the images. But after a little time went by, I discovered that the lens is only sharp when I use the center focal point to focus. It is both difficult to focus and soft (back focusing) if I try to use any of the outer focal points.The solution is to focus and re-compose, and while I don't mind doing that, sometimes when you're at 2.8 and zoomed all the way in, the movement required to re-compose creates an out of focus image.This has been my go to ""walk around"" and ""family snaps"" lens, but because of the focusing problems, I would never use it in my professional work.It is a really good consumer lens, far better than a kit lens. If only it were as sharp on the outer points as it was in the center, It'd be perfect. Sadly, I've had to replace it with the Canon 24-70mm 2.8L."
2,Not even remotely professional grade.,"I'm a wedding photographer. Picked up an additional D700 to go along with my other D700 & primes. Figured I would give a mid-zoom a shot. Well I did and Amazon just received my return. This lens was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! The auto focus was the SLOWEST I have ever experienced on ANY lens. The image quality & bokeh were nice, if you could get it focus on the point you wanted. I had to make a +20 adjustment in my camera just to get the focus on point. I refused to even bring this lens with me to a wedding for fear of missing every shot. I have since picked up the Nikon (Nikkor) 24-70 f/2.8 as my mid zoom and THAT LENS is SPECTACULAR! Highly recommend no one waste their time on this lens unless your shooting still subjects in a laid back environment."
3,Decent Product for the Cost,"Its better than my old lens, its cheaper than a nikon and does a pretty decent job. It sometimes have difficulty focusing, and some of my pics have this cloudish hue, but it gets the job done after a decent photshop."
2,Weird focus problem,It's possible that just the copy they have shipped to me is bad!Problem#1: my copy is too soft at f2.8 to be accepted for most of the focal length range. It gets much worse at the tele end. Stopped down to f3.5 improves only a little.Problem#2: very often it just cannot focus correctly! It seems to me my copy has some front focus problem. I have a canon 60d with the 18-135 kit lens. My kit lens is tack sharp in the center and sometimes a little softer at the left area of the pictures. And the 18-135 I have always focuses accurately and never had any focus problem.I will return it.
4,Great multi purpose lens,"Great lens all around. I like the price, lightweight, fast aperture and sharp. I use it a lot for event photography. The focus could be a tad quicker. I use it on my Pentax K-5."
5,Excellent lens!,"Just recently received the Tamron 28-70 lens and have been using it for only a couple of days. so far I am very pleased with the operation and simple testing. This lens, although relatively expensive, is an excellent value compared to the similar Sony and Sigma competition."
5,Best Buy for the Money,"I got this lens one month ago. I use it with a K10D and as long as I can shoot in the 28-75 range I use it! Sharpness is excellent and being able to shoot at f2.8 is worth the extra-weight.The autofocus is fast for the price range. AF noise is OK but it gets really noisy when it's not able to focus... But anyway you won't use a zoom with that range for wild-life pictures!Even though this is not a macro lens you can still focus pretty close (about 1:3, 1:4 magnification).I recommend this lens..."
4,BIM or Non?,which version of this lens is better the one with the built in motor or the non built in motor?
4,Tamron 28-75 F/2.8 IF MACRO,I haven't had any photos printed yet from this lens. I am initially a Canon fan and went to the Tamron because of price. The telephoto operation seems to drag a bit compared to the Canon. Still have to use it a bit more to be able to give a full recommendation.
1,Vignettes on Canon 5D Mk II,"I'm giving this one star because it is useless on a 5D Mk II. This may be a good lens for other bodies and cropped sensors (although not wide enough for cropped sensor cameras for my taste).I bought this for my Canon 5D Mk II. It vignetted very noticeably at all focal lengths indoors but pointed at the sky outdoors seemed OK.Took it back to the camera store, and they put another copy of the lens on a different 5D Mk II and it vignetted too. It was very noticeable. The camera store guy, who is not a rookie, couldn't figure it out after playing around with it for a half hour. He put a call in to Tamron.So even though the lens seems sharp, it was a big disappointment. I was hoping this would take the place of buying the 24-70 L lens.For now, I'll keep using my primes which are great."
5,Great for weddings and portraits,"I recently started wedding photography, and this lens does the job. It does a great job in low light. I am very pleased I purchased this lens, it was well worth the money."
2,Low Light Auto Focus not good,"I purchased this lens to shoot professional bodybuilding show. There are numerous challenges shooting in these low light conditions with the subjects being very dark. The lens didn't focus sharply in these conditions and I returned it. I did shoot some outdoor photo's with the lens and they looked very good. For the money this is a great lens, but if you are going to use it to shoot weddings or other events that may require you to shoot in low light conditions you might want to look else where. For a good alternative check out the Canon 28mm - 135mm IS, even though it is a f/3.5 - 5.6 with the IS you can take great pictures with it in low light conditions and with the extra zoom and the price at about $230 makes it a great deal."
2,Disappointed,"I am not sure if it was me or the lens, but most of the pictures that I took with it came out soft. Unfortunately, the picture quality was not close to even my kit lens, let alone a Canon 50mm. Even a used Tamron 70-300 that I have takes much better pictures. I read such great things about this lens before buying, I probably had high expectations...sadly, I was disappointed. Had to return it. Love the return policy of Amazon, and I am glad I didnt buy it on ebay from an overseas seller, which I almost did."
4,Tamron 28-300mm for Nikon,I bought a refurbished lens for my nikon 3100 and the results are great. I compared it to the 70-300 before committing to it.I have used it before with Minolta/Sony and the focus speed appears to be much better w/nikon
3,Good but not Great,I really enjoyed using this lens... But when I used the equivalent lens with VC Vibration Compensation I have to say I cant go back. This lens is great if you are using a high ISO or using a tripod. I do a lot of video work I it is still very valuable to me.
4,Great for indoor sports,"I had problems taking indoor basketball shots with the f3.5 zoom, and this f2.8 zoom solved my problems at 1/2 the price of a canon."
4,Excellent Value,"I have very specific needs for a lens of this focal length for the Canon 1DIIn for which it was purchased. My business does a lot of event and youth sports/school portraiture. For this, the lens has exceeded it price point. Center sharpness and color are a good as any Canon or Nikkor I own.From a purely technical standpoint, when testing the lens, it does show softness at all corners- particularly on the top left. On a 1.3 crop of my Canon, most softness is cleared by f5.6, with the exception of the top left, which never clears. Center sharpness is outstanding down to f2.8 through the focal zoom. In practice, for my applications, no weaknesses are visible. Images are exceedingly sharp.Only those who are more interested in testing than shooting will be dissapointed. In practical use, it is simply an outstanding value."
3,Tamron must make their design more manufacturable,"Didn't buy this at Amazon, but ended up returning 3 bad copies in a row before giving up. The first had severe softness at 75mm. The 2nd had severe BF at 28mm. The 3rd had slight BF at 28mm and softness at 75mm.While testing I saw flashes of super sharpness (75mm on 2nd lens and 50mm on 3rd lens). If Tamron could figure out what's wrong w/ their design so it can be more consistently manufactured, they'd have a real winner.I did wish the range were 24-70 instead of 28-75 though...the Sigma 24-70 uses a ridiculous 82mm filter (they should stop at 77mm or the filter prices get ridiculous)."
5,Great lens,Very good picture quality. I feel like with this lens I am almost a Pro.I looking forward to get the 70-200 2.8 also.Good job Tamron for a great price compare to Canon
2,Amazing pictures poor build.,"I bought this lens based on the wonderful pictures I have seen with it. I am a pro photographer, 100% of my income comes from photography. This lens would fill a great spot in my gear except that the build was horrible! The zoom ring was so stiff it would not rotate but instead ""jump"" from say 35 to 50, returned the next day. Amazon(who is always awesome) overnight end me another to try, when I received it had the same issue! Before I contacted amazon again I called tamron USA, where they informed me that yes this sounds like a defect and would be fixable under warrenty. The issue though is I would have to pay to ship it to them! They made a defect product and then wanted me to pay even more money for them to fix it!! Needless to say, I simply returned it to amazon.Image quality=amazingCustomer service for amazon=amazingBuild=poopTamron customer service=poop"
5,An excellent lens...,"This is an excellent lens. I purchased it for my husband who is learning the art of photography. This lens is very versatile taking great photos from close up to far away. He is really enjoying this lens and is a staple in his bag. I recommend this lens, it's worth the money."
2,Really Dissappointed,"After reading all about this lens I was excited about getting it, however I'm not so excited anymore. I was in denial when the pictures weren't coming out sharp. But that's it, the pictures just aren't sharp. Then I took a picture of a gopher in a grass field, with center (spot) focus dead nuts on the gopher and guess what? The grass about a foot behind the gopher is in perfect focus. Now I have to send the lens in for warranty work. Can you say ""hassle"". Right now I'm wishing I'd have bought the Canon 28-135 IS USM instead. The price is about the same, the focal length is better and the IS can get you into some of the same places the constant 2.8 apperature can (not all). Anyway, I'm very dissappointed."
5,Great Lens,"This is my first ""real"" lens and have just started taking my own pictures of my children vs. taking them to a professional photographer. In experimenting with the kit lens vs, this lens, I have found that the wider aperature lets me capture more pictures in lower lighting than the kit lens will allow (without a flash). There really is a difference in quality between this lens and the kit lens."
2,"Excellent lens, but...","This is the second copy of the Tamron AF 28-75mm Di lens I ordered, both copies had front focus issues. Both severely front focus at 60mm to 75mm but at the 28mm to 50mm zoom range, focus was excellent at all apertures, very sharp pictures..I'am very satisfied just using at the 28 to 50mm range but may decide to send it back to Tamron for calibration. If they called this a 28-50mm f/2.8 Di lens it would be worth five stars..."
4,"Great, but not perfect.","I bought this lens for low-light work, but it almost doesn't disappoint. The copy I received is sharp, but it still does a little hunting in low light situations where I felt there was enough light. The build quality is good, but not weather sealed like the Canon L-series. The zoom ring is nice and tight where I really don't need the zoom lock so I sometime forget to set it with no worries. Overall a great lens. I am very pleased with it."
3,Nikon? No. Good? Yes.,"I bought this after reading the reviews, which suggested it was the best value for the money on a mid-range 2.8 zoom. It weighs and costs a fraction of the Nikon equivalent, and on areas where I expected it to be lacking, like focus speed, it is surprisingly fast compared with my 70-200 VRII. Yes, VR would be nice, but the effect is much more noticeable as longer focal lengths, and the image is fairly crisp. Overall, not bad, and something you can certainly walk around with without straining your back."
4,Good everyday lens,"I purchased this lens for use with my Canon 40D with the intention of it being my carry around everyday lens. I had a Tamron 18-50 in the past that was a terrific lens. Unfortunately, this lens does not live up to the past Tamron lens. Picture quality is a bit on the soft side, and the focus is a bit slower and mis-focuses more than I'd like.Overall - I feed the build quality is very good. The range is pretty good, I really like the 75mm at the long end, although wouldnt complain for a bit more on the wide angle side. The large aperature makes for a very shallow depth of field for excellent portraits and low light shooting.On the cons side - the focus is slower and misses more than other Tamron's i've used in the past - and is nowhere near as nice a good Canon lens with an ultrasonic motor. Pictures are a bit soft, which is fine for portraits but not as good for landscapes or archetectual shots.Either way this is a solid lens and for the price I am very happy with it."
5,Tamron AF 28-75mm f/2.8 SP XR,"This is an excellent lens. All my pictures are sharp. Amazon shipped it right on time,"
2,"Maybe a bad copy, focus issues and soft pics",I am sure there must be better copies out there but I was not impressed. The pics it took were amazingly soft which I did not expect. With some pics it appears the problem may have been focusing. As some reported its low light focusing was atrocious.Also the 28-75 was not to my liking but that of course is personal preference. I kept putting on the stock 18-55 IS. I also missed the IS feature with the Tamron lens.In the end a good copy may have been ok but the stock 18-55 IS delivers decent pics with IS and does not cost an extra [...] bucks.I returned the lens. Maybe I will give one another go at a later date but will most likely take the 17-50 Tamron instead.
4,Outstanding Quality For The Price,"I've used this lens as my primary ""walk about"" lens for the past 3 years on the Nikon D200 camera. Given the price to quality ratio, this is one outstanding lens. It is sharp, fast, with offer what I wanted most a constant 2.8. I would highly recommend this for anyone, especially those who need a good everyday lens without having to pay a large sum of money for.See more example of this lens in action at photographybykevin.net. Most of my pictures were taken with this lens, especially the flowers collection."
4,Very interesting Nichols,"The Complete Studio Master Takes by Nichols is a very interesting double Cd. Nichols's style is quite unique, with monkian echoes but keeping its own bebop. It does not sound as anybody else for sure. It is the kind of jazz that requires your full attention in order to be deeply appreciated. Nichols did not have the chance to record much under his name, and since the Blue Note complete edition is out of print, this is the best purchase available in the market (it is the same material excluding the alternate takes). The sound is good and the playing impressive, but I don't rate it higher because it is kind of repetitive, especially for a trio. It was a very welcome arrival into my jazz collection and if you are looking for something different, Mr.Nichols is a good alternative indeed. Sadly he did not live long because there is so much talent and originality in his music."
2,"Not the worse, but the English dub is bad.","As for the anime, I would have to say it's so so. The characters are likable enough on their own. But the English acting in this anime is really bad and I mean really bad. At times I started to think the voice actors just made up the dialog. The changes in their emotion was completely unbelievable. One second this big emotional stage was set, then the character would just go back to normal, as if nothing happened. At one point I almost stopped to smack my head.(real line of the English Dub.) ""In my powerful man arms, I'm going to find my super awesome destiny!"" If I was watching this on a kid's cartoon channel, as a child. I might find this to be entertaining. All in all, the anime was fine. The English Dub was a travesty."
3,"History of Gordon County, Georgia","This book is loaded with historical snippets of Gordon County, Georgia from 1850-1950. It's not easy reading, but may be a useful reference for those who had ancestors in Gordon County, and Calhoun in particular, during that period."
4,This flavor is a jazzy blues,"Zakiya Hooker is the daughter of John Lee Hooker. Her brand of blues is not the guitar dominated boogie style of her father but more a jazzy style of blues. It IS good music and well done and while she may never be the best known blues artist in the family, she does have talent. One thing her did always was - prolific and so far, his daugther has not been that."
3,Satisfied with a little bit of work,This item arrived promptly. It was a little tricky to put together because there were no instuctions at all other than the picture on the box. The hose leading into the top bowl did not seal . After we caulked around the hole and hose the fountain worked . Looks great in our rose garden.
4,Great Shirt,"Love this shirt. Good quality. I like to walk around around wearing it in my ""Fortress of Solitude"". Would recommend to others."
4,A classy peace of female vocals in pink shape,"This is not a typical floyd music. What's all about this album is the expression of selective floyd's masterpieces in a female vocals backed up by great music. Turn off the light, lay back in the arms of nature and feel some great music or imagin yourself in a picnic with close friends playing floyd's songs in the dark side of the moon starring at the fire you made in the heart of the desert. I recommend this CD to all real floyd's fans especially if you like female voclas and slow music."
1,Tragic mistake,"The song choices were mostly lame. The quality is very poor compared to the originals. Only Voivod has successfuly covered Pink Floyd material and that was simply because they chose old old Floyd songs from when they still kind of sucked (Prior to Gilmore's influence) and then made those songs tighter and better sounding than the originals. I don't think they would bother trying to touch anything on Wish..., Dark Side, or Animals. Not even the greatest bass player of all time Les Claypool is capable of covering Pink Floyd well. He covered the entire Animals Album plus other songs and it really sucked compared to Floyd (even though it was still better than most stuff that is out there these days, I wouldn't bother listening to it ever again since I have the real deal Floyd versions)."
2,The Slaughtering,"Egghhh, it sounds like when you speed up your old vynils to 45, and even worse, it's not smooth, it's horrid, and it's just not the classic, Pink Floyd will never be imitated successfully, and will never be surpassed in the greatness they were, I cry harshly at the slaughtering of these masterpieces.The woman tries to get that 'lunatic' edge on her words in ""Comfortably Numb"" but fails miserabley, a true Floydian, knows only the true can do what they have done.""United We Stand...Divided We Fall"""
2,'Echoes Of Pink: A Tribute To Pink Floyd' (Reverberations) Various Artists,"You GOT to be kidding with this one.It's like an easy listening tribute CD to Pink Floyd.My gosh,my grand parents may've actually enjoyed listening to this.Several of the cuts here I tried so hard to get into,but simply could NOT,were ""Money"" by Reyo Bikkin,""Cymbaline"" performed by Maureen Mahon,""Time"" by Melissa Quade and ""See Emily Play"" contributed from Erin Alden.Folks,female vocalists do not belong in covering Floyd songs.I'm assuming that if Gilmour,Mason,Wright or Waters ever heard this disc,they'd most likely feel somewhat insulted.Only use this CD might have is if you wish to give an older friend or loved one an(you got it!)easy listening CD as a gift."
4,Best Pink album not made by Pink,"I like this album very much. As all Pink fans know,it is very difficult to cover Pink materials andstill sounds unique and good. Give this album a try!"
3,..Not that good!!,"It's kinda waste of money...maybe it's a bit good for the first couple of times, however don't be fooled by the samples that are on."
3,A tribute to trashy horror.,"""Terror in the Aisles"" is quite an entertaining compilation of countless horror films, mostly of the low-budget teen-stalker variety, put together in a format that makes it more enjoyable than watching the movies themselves. Granted there are some bizarre choices of movies mixed in with these cheesy horror movies such as the action picture ""Nighthawks"" and the lighthearted Hitchcock caper ""To Catch a Thief"". But, on the other hand, where else can you watch the first, great ten minutes of ""When a Stranger Calls"" without having to sit through the rest of the picture."
4,Amazing montage of horror classics,"As the title says, this movie is chock full of scenes from classic horror movies up until the 90's. Wish I could find this on DVD though."
4,"Great compolation of 60's, 70'sand early 80's horror movies","I actually saw this film before seeing several of the films included in it,and it inspired me to seek them out. Alot of scarry scenes from movies like Jaws,Halloween,Psycho,The Birds,What ever happened to Baby Jane,and hundreds of other classic horror films that laid the ground work for future horror-films. I'd love to see a modern film like this."
4,Read to Me!,"Filled with great poems,the best ""Read to Me,"" on page 29---""Read to Me riddlesand read to me rhymes,read me storiesof magical times.......""My only negative- its cover is a pinky lavender- making it seem like a book that will only appeal to girls, while in reality the protagonist shown in the illustrations is a boy baby bear."
4,Akane Iro No Somaru Sake,"This Anime is good but bite slow for my likeing. It abut a boy meet a girl who she stay at his house with his sister. It was a misunderstand at first.As time went by the girl like him, She was a bite worried about the boy sister bcouse she thinks that there relationship bite to close. In truth thesister not really his sister."
3,DISSAPOINTED,"I WAS DISSAPOINTED. AMAZON AND THE ANIMAL PLANET STORE CONFIRMED ME, THAT THE DVD INCLUDED SUBTITLES (SPECIALY SPANISH), BUT THAT WAS A LIE. THE DVD IS ABSOLUTLY AMAZING, EVERYTHING, BUT NOT THE RESPONSABILITY OF THE STORE."
4,Wolves a Legend returns to Yellowstone,I absolutely love this story and encourage everyone who has a passion and love for the pristine outdoors and a desire to restore what humans have disrupted--to watch it...wolves are in constant peril around the world and deserve our respect and protection...watch this story--it's beautiful and will make you want to visit Yellowstone & learn about the harmonious balance wolves have brought back to the park...
3,we are not alone,And that is the way it was and is intended. Sharing this planet with other persons (we call animals) is essential to our well being. WE are all related and what happens to any spoke in the wheel of life will surely come to impact on the rest of us. This film should be required viewing at an age when opinions on the value of life is being determined.
4,Wolves:A Legend,Awesome documentary about the reintroduction of wolves into yellowstone. If you like this one check out The rise of black wolf aswell.
2,Weird format on Plasma screen,"This is great film at an IMAX theater, but for some reason, when you plug in the DVD, you have this weird smaller square in the middle of the screen showing the movie, surrounded by a still background. The movie takes up about 2/3 of the screen. I can't explain it. I have a regular 42"" Plasmas TV, I don't have the same problem with other DVD's."
4,Good Music,"If you're into the instrumental/experimental kind of music, I would highly recommend this cd. It's very unique, and great to listen to. If you're into the bands ""godspeed you black emporer!"" ""explosions in the sky"" or mogwai, I would say this cd is definitely for you. If you're debating getting the cd, i'd say go for it."
5,Great multi-tool,"I have 10 or 12 multi-tools, and this one is my favorite, as it has the most functionality and is easy to use. The only downside is it's pretty big if you want to carry around the bits and ratchet, but that's an unavoidable drawback.Other reviews have covered this tool thoroughly, I just want to chime in as another happy customer."
2,"Ugly, Ugly, Ugly","Mattel missed a great opportunity with this doll. When it was first announced I was picturing something similar to the Midge or Stacey gift sets - repro doll in original outfit, original packaging, and bonus outfit laid out beside. What we got was the monstrosity pictured, that barely resembles the promo photo - ugly doll already dressed in the outfit, ugly packaging, and ugly layout. Considering that this doll is one of the most in demand by collectors, Mattel really goofed. Shame."
5,Well Worth a Listen,"A friend recently purchased a copy of this CD for me, for which I am grateful! What catches your ear immediately in ""Finding My Way"" is the smooth clarity of Raquel's voice. It has a bold yet soft quality that captures you, unrelenting, throughout each track. While the style of the album is laid-back, track six (""Ready for Love"") offers refreshing challenge to Raquel's vocal dynamic, and she meets that challenge with ease. The mix of original songs and contemporary classics are melodically distinct, and maintain cohesiveness in their assemblage. Raquel covers Stephen Stills' ""For What It's Worth"" with a fresh and modern flair. Equally, Gary Wright's ""Dreamweaver"" is an ideal fit for her velvet tones. Raquel's voice is a well kept secret; rewarding for those who discover it. You simply cannot experience Raquel's music without it leaving a smile on your heart."
5,Finally,"Raquel has finally made her dream come true and the rest of us get to benefit from it. Her music has soul...her voice will touch your heart. This CD will make you want to get up and move. I'm happy to see years of hardwork pay off, she deserves it. Way to go Raquel. Enjoy your success. Allison"
2,These are not original recordings!,"I was greatly disappointed when I listened to this CD for the first time... I bought it because I thought the songs were the original recordings (or would at least sound so) - but they do not! Somehow, they miss the spark, all the life is gone. I could have spent my money wiser..."
4,Old but good.,This video is old but it is a great workout. I love Jaime Brenkus' work and highly recommend his workout videos to anyone looking for a workout without benefit of a gym.
1,Real Workout?,This seemed to be a really easy workout and I hardly felt anything. The 2 workouts are on the same video tape. 8 Minute Thighs is actually 8 Minute Legs. 8 Minute Buns is more than 8 minutes. The instuctor doesn't seem to know what he's doing and repeats the same things over and over. It's a pretty boring video and there's nothing to keep you motivated in it.
3,Firm Up!,"I bought this tape looking for a short work-out that would help me to firm up and give me new ideas for a lower-body workout. The buns section is great for beginners and experienced fitness buffs as well. I exercise regularly and this short workout is definately beneficial. While the buns workout can be somewhat challenging, I found the legs to be somewhat easier than the buns and would recommend that portion for beginners or those who don't exercise regularly."
4,Requires More Commitment,"It was only because I saw such great results from the ""8 Minute Abs"" video that I could really come through with the level of commitment I needed to make this tape work. I mean, for some reason this took alot longer for me to get with the program. It's not so simple as the ""New Sex Now"" or ""Goddess Worship"" videos, where you just watch it once and you pretty much get it. With this program you gotta watch the tape every single time, and follow along with the guy doing the stuff. And while it is fun to do that with the Goddess Worship video too, it's a different kinda viewing experience... though still highly enriching. Anyway, the point is that you gotta put these techniques into action, every single day, and practice this stuff so it pays off -- since there's no sense just watching tapes like these just once and continuing to feel fat."
5,Worth it,"I purchased this video along with the 8 min Abs/Arms, Both video are well worth the price. Just 8 minutes was enough for the Buns work out it felt like forever but it's over before you know it. My whole family can work out together, 16 mins work out! Can't beat that."
2,Boring,"Boring! This guy knows about three phrases which he repeates over and over again. The music is cheesy too. Still, the exercises are useful. I would suggest learning them and using a clock to time your workout."
3,So-So Results,"I think the ""buns"" part of this video is great--I felt and saw results almost immediately. But I was disappointed with the ""legs/thighs"" portion. I have problems with my knees so was unable to do some of the lunges and squats. Despite doing the rest of the tape, I didn't see much positive result in my legs or thighs."
5,Lots of Hope,As a 41 year old mom of two I don't have a lot of time for exercise and I figured I at least could give myself 8 minutes a day. On top of that my metabolism has taken a nasty turn (yet again) and these two areas are of great concern. I've been doing the exercises for a four days now. The tape is fast paced and tough. I really appreciate the clock as it motivates me to keep going when I feel I can no longer. I do both buns and thighs in 16 minutes and I feel I've really done something. I can't wait to see the results and I'm confident I will.
2,"BORING, BORING, BORING","This book can't hold a candle to any of Levy's first 3. I found it to be exceedingly boring, and owning and having read all of Levy's books, I doubt very much if I will buy his next one!!!"
1,BAD QUALITY VHS TAPE SENT TO ME,"The VHS tape sent to me was bad, bad, BAD: there was nothing but static. I tried at several intervals, but always got static. There was never any trace of image or sound. A total WASTE! Nothing much more to be said."
2,Careful with a Dell Dimension,"I bought this RAM to upgrade my Dell Dimension 3000 from 256 to 512 MB. Same (apparent) specifications as the Dell RAM; however, when installed in the second memory slot in parallel with the Dell memory, the machine would not even boot up. Made a bunch of strange noises that was about it. I swapped slots with the same results. I tried the new RAM by itself, and the Dell booted up and worked fine. Apparently, there is some unspecified parameter that is incompatible with the Dell memory stick. I sent the Ballistix memory stick back to Amazon with an explanation as to what happened and got a full refund. Thank you, Amazon! I then contacted Crucial Memory (maker of Ballistix) and ordered a 1 GB (2x512 MB) matched memory pair, which arrived in about a week. It's installed and working great! Really speeded up my computer a bunch.To avoid this siuation, I recommend that you always order memory upgrades in matched pairs, for Dell computers anyway."
2,Definitely a First Book,"This book needs editing for spelling and grammar as well as story content. The author needlessly repeats information throughout the book. The characters are likeable, but their dialogue is stilted. The story progresses tediously. The plot has interesting aspects, but the author needs to develop a more fluid style before continuing to publish fiction. The style is fine for nonfiction. Over all, a very wearisome read."
1,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","The author should be lauded for a unique story idea but that is where any praise ends. Character interactions and plot development were tedious. The ending chapters diverged from the original descriptive passages leading one to beleive a deadline forced the ending. I imagine the author sat down, made an outline with facts about places he'd been, and then wrapped the facts into his plot. Spend your money on an Australian travel brochure and go to an old book store for dilapidated paperback Christie novels instead."
2,Very disappointing book,"I had hoped that the combination of Australia, mystery and the opera house would be an interesting read. This was not the case. The book is poorly written, has stilted dialogue, and poorly developed characters. Hopefully the author learned from this book and his subsequent books aren't as painful to read."
2,Mumbled solutions....,"The book presents a few scenarios (though not enough) for self rescue but ultimately the author produces such complicated and mumbled solutions that understanding the diagrams is work. Most of the solutions could be presented in a simpler way, with less backups, less fuss whitch is usually the way emergency situations require you to act. Also very common devices such as the croll, tibloc and other vertical devices are not at all mentioned. I think this could be better."
4,pleased so far!,"Happy with the lessons I have covered so far. Seems to give you practical, usable vocabulary, whilteaching you the necessary grammar."
1,POOR PRODUCT,"Thisis the most worthless product...very dissappointed...it never even attempted to get cool,much less 40 degrees...box is misleading"
2,Just so-so,"While this unit does cool it will not keep your food nearly as cool as a normal fridge. Also, the unit is rather loud. The fan on the top runs whenever it is on and sounds about like a loud desktop computer.Keep in mind that it takes many hours to cool anything down so don't expect to put a can of soda in and drink it before the next day.Finally, I should note that the vendor sent me the incorrect version of this product. I ordered the 'brushed metal' and got the 'red' in its place. It works the same so I just kept the red one rather than mess with RMAing it."
2,Depends on What you use it for.,"This device will not work with all accessories, I tried to use it with several accessories so that I do not have to rebuy things like the italk etc. but it does not provide the proper connection for these devices. Even at $10, if it doesn't work you wasted your money. Caveat Emptor."
3,9 to 30 Pin adapter,"The adapter that I recieved did not operate properly, thje idea behind it has good intentions but when i hooked it up to my old ipod accessories it got extremely quiet and you couldnt even hear it."
5,Really Good Read on a critical subject,"This book is really good at teaching the most critical aspects of the endgame. It is probably suitable for players up to around 1800 USCF.Beyond that rating level, something more like Shereshevkys' series would be more appropriate.Don't be put off by the single reviewer who signed on and left 3 reviews (two from Australia, one from new York) with 1 star. He clearly has some sort of ax to grind.This book is very good, and worth getting.Amazon.com needs to do a better job at eliminating multiple reviews from the same person."
5,A Must Read,"If you only read one book on endings, read this one. Mr Soltis writes in an entertaining form that illustrates ideas rather than plowing through endless bishop versus knight endgames. I'm sure any Class A and below player will find this adds 50-100 rating points."
3,"Good info perhaps, but format is annoying","I have to be the lone voice of dissent, it seems. I wanted a text to teach me more about the endgame. This book is peppered with cutsie drawings, written in a gosh-golly style that really annoyed me after three pages, and tries so hard to be ""unintimidating"" that it instead becomes distracting. The layouts are confusing--often diagrams are two pages ahead of the text--and the quotes are not helpful. (""Let no man surrender so long as he is unwounded and can fight. --Field Marshall Montgomery"" --Huh?) I'd prefer a less chatty, less folksy book. A lot of people apparently like this approach. While I'm all for making the endgame less painless, this book didn't do it for me. I'd rather read a ""dry"" analysis."
1,What Secrets?,"It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the great reviews about it on this website were written by the author himself. The book is absolute RUBBISH.I have never read a book with so little genuine chess content. The vast majority of the book consists of stupid (and annoying) discussion between the author, and a pupil concerning endgame principles. The trouble is, the discussion is so general and basic as to be meaningless. It only offers basic principles such as ""keep your rook active"", with little to no practical examples.The book fails to cover numerous key endgame topics, such as pawn structures, pawn breakthroughs, entry squares for the king.The title is completely misleading. The book is limited to basic concepts, which even then, are poorly explained, with very little supporting analysis or examples. The depth of analysis is truly pathetic - frequently no more than one or two lines of play, looking ahead 3-4 moves. If only endgames were this simple.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK."
3,Please fill in the blanks,"I received the lab manual before the expected date in good condition; however, many of the question pages were torn out. I wish this information had been shared ahead of time rather than finding out while working on my lab report at home. A+ for shipping and C+ for product description."
1,Very old edition,"The edition was not specified - instead of one of the latest editions that I have expected, I received one that was published thirty years ago - for a science book that is simply unacceptable."
5,If you want a gift to pass on.,My daughter got a pink and white dragon as a shower gift and we just ordered one for my son. These banks are great. They are built to last common wear of children. They come in a wide variety of colors and styles to suit kids. There are two different sizes but all varieties have the fun of watching a coin work its way to a large belly. The wooden body is only about an inch thick but it can cover more space due to belly and leg style. They can be found at specialty shops or on web sites. Some of which you can have your bank personalized. The belly is easy to open for an adult but make sure you do so carefully while bank on its side otherwise when it releases coins can spill everywhere.
4,No Limits,"Shawn was my student when I taught high school social studies. (the ""B.B."" stood for ""blind boy"" and was a nickname I don't believe he still uses) Shawn has not only a gift for music but a gift for life as well. It is impossible to know Shawn without emerging from the experience changed. Listening to the music of this remarkable young man will give you a sense of possibilities, not boundaries or limits."
3,Some historical merit,"I'm torn on this review...It is about a great group of intellectual women, who have had a major impact on the education of young women throughout the world, and they certainly deserve recognition for their 210 years of sevice in changing others' lives. But the author doesn't know whether she wants to be fan or foe of them, and she certainly can bear a grudge against them 25 years after she completed her education with in one of their schools. The blame should go towards her parents, but she reseves it for the intelligent women who tried to educate her or life. Harrison is also was sloppy in her research and the checking of facts, so her skill as a writer of history is lacking.If you want a very broad starting point to learn about The Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (RSCJ), this book will suffice."
2,OK,"I brought the can opener because I had a Black & Decker several years ago. Unfortunatley, it is not the same quality - very poorly made and difficult to use. I would not recommend this can opener to anyone."
2,This product makes can openning a challenge,We have not been too pleased with this product. It works but not as easily as it should. We would not recommend this item to others.
1,JUNK,"$60 dollars and the piece of junk is broke after 2 weeks. Number indication fell off, and then it just quit working. Looks great, just doesn't work. Sad thing is I haven't even received the credit card bill yet. Sucks for me."
5,big dog feeder,"Have purchased this item 7 years ago at a pet store and have chased around trying to find another. Was so happy to find it thru Amazon. This is the best. My dogs love it. The bowls are just the right size for water and food as they have huge heads (English Mastiffs weighing in at over 200 lbs. each, the whole dog not just their head. HA!!) Would highly recommend this raised feeder."
3,"nice idea, poor design","i love the size of this product and that it's made out of durable plastic but i have mastiffs and each time i remove the bowls to refill food and water, there is 3 inches of water under each bowl that i have to sponge out...what a pain in the neck!!! not thrilled..."
4,Great for my 80lb German Shepherd Puppy!,"I was excited to find this feeder. I bought it based on the other reviews and the dimensions. My puppy is almost a year old and he will weigh over 100lbs. It is perfect for a large breed dog! The only thing I was disappointed with was that the legs of the table are grey and the top is black. When I ordered online, I thought I was getting brown & tan. I am very particular about my decor so its minor. I decided not to worry about it because I was excited to get it set up. It works great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
4,LOVE this book,"Well written with tips and details that are unexpected, helpful and interesting. Recipes are delicious and many! Initially I got this from my library, but it was so good that I had to buy my own copy. The only thing missing to get it to 5 star would be lots of photos."
1,Beware - BIG logo on stand,The coasters and stand are VERY cheaply made and there is a HUGE logo on the base of the stand that has the manufacturer's name. This is not pictured in the image. It makes the set look very cheap. The metal used for the stand is thin and the coasters fit so tightly into the stand they scratch the first time you pull them out. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
2,cheap quality,I love the style but the coasters are really cheaply made.They scratch every time you pull them out...and they do look much better and stylish in the picture.Not my favorite item...
3,Beautifully Non-Functional,stops water-rings on glass tables for the most part. the non-absorbent top doesn't prevent condensation from getting on the table though. i wouldn't recommend this for use on woodtables or furniture. but then i knew when i bought these that they would absorb all the water. they do look fantastic on my coffee table though. as long as you know going in that these aren't the most functional coasters you'll be alright.
5,No one is better,"Brendan Benson has been my favorite musician ever since my brother first had the cd, and I borrowed it from him. I now have 2 copies, incase something happens to one. :) I can't even explain in words how much I love this album. All of the songs are great, and catchy. I never, ever get sick of this cd. I could go on, and on. I mean, look at my email address. *LoL* My favorite song on this album, although I love EVERY SINGLE ONE is, ""Me just purely"" Brendan Benson is my hero, and I hope, hope, hope that he comes out with more, because nothing, in my opinion, seems to compare."
5,Great Power-Pop,"I had a friend introduce this album to me a few years ago and liked it then but never really gave it much of chance. Then ""Tiny Sparks"" was released from his follow up album ""Lapalco"". I really enjoyed that song and decided to pull this disc back out and give it another go round. Anyways, I'm glad I did because this time I was absolutely hooked. All these songs are just simple straight blasts of pure pop perfection. There's not a dud in the bunch. Some people may complain that the lyrics are a little corny or just stupid and that may be, but with songs as well written as these just kick back and hum along to the wonderful melodies and songs Benson created on this album. Check out his other two cd's as well, ""Lapalco"" and ""The Alternative to Love"", they're great as well."
4,Brendan Benson's album is full of real music!!!,"This debut release is that of a true young musician interested in making music for himself. His personal lyrics, and his raw recordings show that he oubviously wasn't expecting to go platinum. The songs are enjoyable and are worth analyzing the lyrics. His acoustic work on ""me just purely"" and ""crosseyed baby"" are real and settling. I think this c.d. is definitely worth $9 and a 3 day wait."
4,Ahead of its time,"1996? Really? Pretty impressive. Just not as impressive as ""Lapalco."" Why? It can't keep the pace. Starts off really strong and then sort of bends in between waves of the great and the average. Two of its finest songs are the first two tracks, but they're both under a minute and a half long. Disappointing, yet these short songs command repeat listens for the those oh-so-brief yet beautiful melodies.Additional stand-outs include ""Insects Rule,"" ""Cherries"" and ""The Swamp."" This album is more varied than ""Lapalco,"" which both sets it apart and brings it down in some instances. And still, it's worth the money if you already own Benson's other efforts."
3,Light enjoyable music,"I instantly took a like to this CD when I first listened to it. The music is light and the lyrics are not completely concerned with existential angst. The album might be far from a perfect compedium of music, but therein lies its feckless joy. A nice CD."
3,Another masterpice decimated by 'full screen'.,"One of the most innovative, exciting movies of a generation, and NOT AVAILABLE in widescreen.Demi is a cinamatograhic master and his work has been butchered by VHS full screen format. ('Full' of what, one wonders.)Watch this tape and see half the movie as created. DEMAND your DVD release now."
2,I am sure this is very funny live onstage...,"I have read a few of Spalding Gray's books, and I found them hysterically funny. So a while back I decided to work my way through all of his books. All his books have been bought and are on my shelf, so I hope this one is just one of those bad apples..Don't get me wrong, Spalding is a very, very funny guy. And the other books I have read (""Sex and death to the Age 14"" and ""Morning, Noon and Night"") are just fantastic books. They made me laugh out loud over and over and over again.This one however.. Not quite... It is more a ""transcript"" of his stage performances. You can tell that this would be hysterically funny onstage, but reading it on an overcrowded tube on my way to work was maybe not the best setting, and probably didn't give this material justice.Anyway, I think these stories are better left for live performances."
2,"Spalding, where are you??","The recent disappearance of Spalding Gray has made me realize what I don't like about this film: its narcissism. It's Gray's defining characteristic. After a while, despite Jonathan Demme's fabulous direction (he makes the best of a limited repertoire) it just gets boring."
2,Sinking to Cambodia,"I thought this would be a great insight into someone who had been involved in the film ""The Killing Fields"" the academy award winning film about the fall of Phnom Penh and the associated attrocities heaped upon the Cambodian people in 1975. But I was quite disappointed. Although I expected profanity and the like. I was put off with how much was communicated through its pages. Fair enough not everyone believes the same way or has the same value system. However this book was not a consuming read as I thought it would be. Yes, it spoke about the day to day trials of filmmaking. And in particular the activities of Spalding. Because Mr Gray had a relatively small role in the film, it could not enlighten the me with much insight other than Mr Gray's personal experiences and observations of other crew members.It may be a great work for some but it did not work for me."
5,HIstory,"I understand that public schools may not really teach about Pol Pot and the Rouge. Therefore, I suggest this as a background that one should then research in History. My Schools always did cover these Events and There is also plenty of video footage out there in relation to these events. Oh Yeah... Taking the DVD as an art Piece, Spalding Gray is a great talent in monolouges as well as writings. He is no longer with us... And his legacy of media is rich and eye- opening."
2,Bad Transfer,"Though the monologue is wonderful and the Jonathan Demme's style undeniable, I must caution anyone considering this particular dvd. The picture is cut off on the top, bottom, left, and right. The picture quality itself is fine but it is distracting for a while, knowing that you are not seeing the full picture."
5,alternative cinema,"Engaging, absorbing, not the usual big-screen drivel. To watch this film is to understand the elegance of expression which has been lost in the present era."
2,Watch out for explicit content,"There's no denying Gray's story-telling abilities. However, this film should carry a rating (preferably ""Rated R""). While I enjoyed many parts of this film, I do not much care for profanity. I care even less for graphic descriptions of sexual encounters. There was no warning that this material was in this film. Had I known that these elements were included in this video, I never would have purchased it."
2,Dissapointed,I chose this product because so many people in the wedding business recommended it for low light situations. The 2.8 aperture was nice but this lens was not sharp. Every single one of my shots was the same. Very soft in the center. Even my mother who knows NOTHING about photography and lenses noticed it. I sent it back. I've heard some people say that they bought this lens and it was sharp....I guess it's hit or miss....good luck!
1,Dirty and broken,"The lense was filthy on the glass and edges and had to be cleaned first. The manual aperture adjustment ring is broken, a reason I bought this lense. Very disappointed."
2,Poor quality,1) Poor quality material2) Very heavy3) Too much of heat produced4) Tooooooo Pricy5) Just 512MB RAM for such high price?
3,Keyboard,"I have a 16-month old HP-Pavilion ZE55..US laptop (pentium chip, 512MB ram) that I'm sending back for the second time because of problems with the keyboard. In the first incident, the ""P""-key popped loose. This time, ""R""-key has popped loose while the ""N"" and ""M""-keys have become illegible. Computer keyboards (be they desktops or laptops) last and last and last... which explains my disappointment with my Pavilion (especially because it will cost me real money to have the R, N, M keys fixed. [The hard-drive, the monitor, the CPU and the wireless ""G""-card are performing very well, though.]"
4,Runs small even for women!,"Order bigger than you think you will need! I am a women with broad shoulders so I thought the men's suit would be a better option. I am 5'7. And about 180. I usually wear a women's l- xl or size 14. I ordered a men's large, and really struggled to tug this suit on. Once zipped, I found it tight on the chest, And a little short in shoulder to crotch length, so I have decided to return and order an XL! Seemed really well made, so I am happy with the design."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"I ordered this wet suit based on the reputation of this company and I was right. U.S. Divers makes good stuff at an affordable price compared to the competition. The wet suit is very well made except for the seams at the legs and the sleeves which I am afraid might start to fall apart after a few trips to the ocean. But unfortunately, I will not be able to use this wet suit at all because although I ordered X-Large for my size, it turned out that, it's not big enough especially in the chest area. So, if you want to order this product, I highly recommend that you buy it one size or two bigger just to be sure."
4,Nice for the price,Make sure to buy one size bigger then you measure. Well made. Keeps me warm and comfortable in most conditions. Wish the zipper lanyard was 3 inches longer or I had longer arms.
2,Bad Stitching...,The suit fit well and looked nice. It was used on two dives when the white stitching started to come undone. After a couple more dives it looked terrible (though was still usable). I didn't return it since I had bought it ahead of time for a trip and missed the window of opportunity. Maybe it was just bad luck :(
4,U.S. Divers Mercury Shorty Adult Wetsuit is good,I have used this wetsuit several times in my pool starting this winter. Water is around 62 degree. It keeps the body relatively warm but not sure why the water can get into my back through the neck.
4,Good for warmer water...,"This wetsuit fit very well according to the sizing chart. It seems well made and works well also. It only provides a limited amount of added warmth, so make sure you are not purchasing this for significantly cold water."
4,"For short, chubby guys out there. . . .","Me: 44"" chest, 36"" waist, 170lbs, 5'7"". I purchased the large and it is a very snug fit. I was originally going to purchase the medium/large but read other reviews on here warning that these run small.I purchased this so I could swim a few extra weeks during the season when the water is cooler. After testing it--I was very happy with the purchase for this use.For any others new to wetsuits, this does not come with cleaning instructions. However, a quick Internet search yields simple methods to keep your wetsuit nice and clean."
5,great suit!,Ive used this suit in Okinawa Japan in the winter. It keeps me warm and toasty. I get about three hours in the water without getting too cold. The armored panel in the front has kept me from tearing it to shreds in the coral.
3,The M/L is built for skinny kids,"I bought the Medium/Large. I'm 5""8' 170lbs 33"" waist and I wear a medium shirt. Looks good and nice material but when I put in on I could not zip it up. It fit my wife who is 5'2"" 135lb so I gave it to her. The medium/large is for a 38-40 inch chest which is tiny. I need a 43-44 inch so I would have to go to XL or XXL for these things to fit my 5'8"" frame. If you are a skinny kid with a pencil neck and a 38 inch chest go for it. Otherwise get the larger size.. My guess is at least 2 sizes over you shirt size."
5,Amazing,This wetsuit kept me worm in Chicago Lake Michigan. I Jet Ski over the summer season and the water temperature was around 50 F and I did not even feel cold at all. I used the size chart that they had on Amazon and it fits perfectly. I only hoped the zipper was at the front so I don't have to call my girlfriend to zip me up every time I get out of the water but that's really not a big deal at all. This Product gets 5 Starts all around.
2,Didn't fit right,"The price of this Shorty was the reason why I bought it. I know my size, since I've had several shorties in the past. This however didn't fit right. The fit was not snug on the chest part, just a little loose. I'm a male, that's in-shape, and I'm thinking this Shorty will probably be better for a female. I returned the item, and thank Amazon for it."
1,Still waiting!,"They supposedly arrived in LA on Nov. 20., but i am still waiting and it is the 27th. I live in LA! the traffic is bad but not that bad to cause a delay of more than 7 days! Besides, it is getting cold here and would like to go back in the water. What could possibly take so long!"
5,DIVERS SHORTY WETSUITS TWO,have had them for some time but have not had an opportunity to wear them but they look GREAT THANK YOU
4,comfortable,"When you see the costume for the first time, thinks it's too big for the measure, but then wear it is fully seated.The only drawback I had was that as I am of very small stature (5 ""4) sew the waist due to fit me. (What cosi without any cutting with scissors, needle and gather only).But putting aside my size, the suit has been a success in my work, I can take the class runs without suffering from cold.Thank you."
1,Cheap design that breaks,"I owned 3 pairs of these:Pair #1: I wore them for 3 months at the gym (4 times per week, 2 hours each time). Then, the sound stopped working out of one of the ears.Pair #2: They snapped in half at the top middle joint as soon as I took them out of the box when I attempted to put them over my head.Pair #3: I wore them for about 2 weeks at the gym, and they snapped in half. I then used tape to tape them together because I was tired of buying new earphones, but then the sound stopped working out of one of the ears.Don't buy these; they are garbage."
2,heidi,"The headband slips off my head quite easily ( it is designed for sports use), rendering them useless. The seller ShipSound makes it very difficult to reach them and has a policy stating that if the merchandise has been opened it is non-returnable. Basically, I am out of luck and very unhappy about it."
5,Awesome,Received item in a very short period of time. And it was just as listed. Great item for Father's day. He loved them.
1,don't bother,"these look really cheap and the table wobbles when done , even with a brace underneath, not worth the $ and effort"
3,"solid top, legs could be better","The top of the stand is solid and looks good. The ""SmartFit"" removable pieces on the legs are a nice way to customize the height, but also make the legs feel a little flimsy or shaky. Still it's a decent stand overall, and less tacky looking than a Fellowes stand I'd previously bought. As a side note I believe Amazon may have sent me an item that had been returned, because the top had some stratches on it."
2,Better instructions would have been GREAT!,"Am I the only one who tried popping the supports together to get an idea of how high I wanted it, only to find out that they don't come apart? Wish the instructions had something written to that effect rather than a bunch of colorful hands and no instructions. When I tried to pull the supports apart, one of the plastic pegs broke off. I ended up breaking the whole piece out with some tools - not pretty, but does the job. Not faulting Amazon here; I know they would have replaced it had I asked. That being said, this stand works great for my 26"" tv; the cable box fits underneath the stand perfectly. Just be careful!"
3,"Looks good and works fine, but versatility comes at a price","A few issues:The legs on this thing are a bit creaky on account of all of the removable height adjusters, and there are visible lines between each piece, which makes it a bit less pretty. Also, the rubber nubs that attach to the bottom don't stick super well if you're moving it around occasionally.Bottom line: If you anticipate moving this around a lot, or your desk or monitor wobbles around a bit, I might not buy this. Also wouldn't recommend it for laptops. Otherwise, it's nice, looks cool, and it does its job well for a respectable price."
2,terrible marketing for this,Well it works but the wrong way. Firstly they dont tell you the dimensions from inside the screw holes. A 15 inch tuner or whatever WONT fit. Although the dimensions say 15 or less. But again the screws mess that all up. I did manage to turn the monitor stand the other way but it looks silly but it works. Also one screw went in loosleywont not tighten stripped. Also the stickers they give you to hide the screw is awful wont stay on long before falling off! wouldnt recoomend to anyone save your money for something else!!! Not worth the mony. Should tell you exact dimensions underneath stand so you can figure out if your tuner or component will fit at all! Poor design. Top of stand is wood will scratch eventually as well
1,Broken,It looked like it was going to be great for our office but when I got to the final hex screw I found it wasn't punched so the screw has a flat top (no where for the Allen wrench!).I contacted Kensington since this monitor stand comes with a two-year manufacturers warranty but no word yet.All in all they seem like they don't have good quality control or customer service so I won't be buying any of their other products for our offices.Guess I'll probably have to mail the half assembled one I have here back. I do not recommend this product or this company.
2,Not a high quality product...,"The actual flat platform was fine, but the legs were of very poor quality. The pieces ""snapped"" together, but were difficult to pull apart to make any adjustments (I actually broke one). Also, one of the screws to attach the platform to the legs was defective and could not be tightened with the wrench that was included."
5,useful device and priced right,i like it. smooth looking and unobtrusive. adjustable height. i use it to raise a kodak all-in-one printer up to store various kinds of paper underneath along with the printer's power transformer and my reading glasses.
3,Don't bother,See the curved corners on the stands? Don't place it near the edge of a desk or hutch. My monitor just fell on me and almost fell to the floor while I was looking for a printer jam. It should be designed with no curved edges on the stand supports. The only reason the monitor didn't fall to the floor or on my foot was because it was still wired to the computer.
3,Where's the passion?,"I wish there was a 1/2 star rating because this CD deserves a two and half star rating instead of a three star one. Moore is one of the best blues players out there. As he proved on Still Got the Blues, he can play the Texas blues like he shared mother's milk with the Vaughn brothers (Stevie Ray and big brother Jimmie, co-founder of the Fabulous Thunderbirds).I'm not looking for everything to be Still Got the Blues or Parisienne Walkways, but I do like inventiveness, freshness in the sound. Moore has left his delicacy behind for chunking power chords without any of the kind of finesse he's capable of. Check out Scars. An album full of power and rockers, but amazingly inventive.This album has a somewhat stale feel. I love Moore, and wish more people knew who he was, but this is not his best effort by any stretch, and bringing in former Thin Lizzy drummer and band mate, Brian Downey, didn't to much to invigorate the album, either.It's really a pity."
1,"Incompatible with most phones, as others have pointed out","My unit was installed by the electricians during a remodel. When I read the specs on this product and on my phone, I realized that they were incompatible because of a voltage mismatch. Like other reviewers, I found that my phone needs 6.0-6.5 volts, which is below the output of this jack.Amazon is currently suggesting that you buy it along with the SL82318 phone. Read the manual for that phone and you'll see that the input voltage is 6.0, which is once again incompatible with this ridiculous product.Does anybody know of a similar product that's compatible with phones?"
4,Love the idea!,"Just installed yesterday.Connecting to the port securely was a bit of a challenge for the electrician, but with patience came success.So far, so good. Love the idea! Thanks."
1,"Misleading description, not what I thought it was","I purchased this product to remove the plug for my cordless phone on the kitchen counter. Based on every description I read, I thought this used the power from the phone line to power the cordless phone. WRONG! It needs 110 VAC AND a phone line run to the same electrical box. So a retrofit is not an option, unless you are willing to rip into your drywall.It is a great idea, but advertising should be much clearer that it is for new construction or remodelling only, not for use with existing installations."
1,No Room,This bag is great if you only want to carry the video camera and 1 spear tape. There is no room for anything else no mater how you place the camera you cant get the charger a spear battery nothing in the bag with it. The battery and tape well there alright it a battery and tape not much to say bout that.
4,"Yeee Haaaaa ! But Where's ""Johnny Get Angry""??","Twenty ear-cuddling pearls that bring home the country-girl irony, the big-kick fun and the tingling inner gorgeousness of k d's pre-Ingenue period.Just one omission has left me this side of breathlessly ecstatic: k d's startlingly piercing cover of Joanie Somer's 1962 top ten hit ""Johnny Get Angry"" is no where in sight. How could you bring me so close to ecstasy and leave without socking it to your weak-kneed lover?!"
5,Terrific!,The driving sound never lets up! This album is an energetic showcase for KD Lang's fabulous voice (she could sing the telephone book and make it interesting) and song-writing talents. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
1,amazon was no help,"i am sure this is a very nice c/d, that is ahy I paid for it,however I NEVER recievd it."
3,"no me gusta el country, peroooo...",muy recomendable para completar la coleccion de quienes somos mas pop.
3,Bulky,This is fine. I think the concealment capabilities are over emphasized. It is nice that it sits horizontally but the stock Glock magazine carrier is far easier to conceal - at least for a more slender build. Is is perfectly serviceable but I was surprised how bulky the material is. I'll keep it but I'm using the stock carrier day-to-day.
4,More than I expected,"The best feature of this dvd is that you can create playlists of images and audio which will loop. The images are very nice and have diverse images of different types of water images (some aquarium, some ocean, some rain, etc). The music can be a bit cheezy, but there is also well-recorded audio of the ocean/rain/aquarium noise that you can select instead. I've used this at work to play behind the singers I bring in and it has fabulous effects on the vibe of the room.This dvd gives you a bunch of fantastic options. I would highly recommend it for someone who wants to have diverse and interesting backgrounds. But if you want to just pop in the video and have 1 image play, this is not the dvd for you."
4,Great book,"I enjoyed this book. I was nervous about reading a ""romance novel"" by a male author but Wayne Jordan is an excellent writer. I loved the way he creates his characters- sexy, sensual, loving, kind, and sensitive. This is the 1st bok in the Buchanan series- I can't wait to read the next story."
2,Stopped Working After 2 Years,"The title pretty much sums it up. After less than two years, the thermostat would only sometimes kick on when it's supposed to. This is unacceptable. I would have given the product 5 stars otherwise."
3,Not bad - not great,It's ok. I don't like the 15 minute delay when you turn it on though. Plus you can't see the dispay for the inside temperature unless you turn it on. I hate that. I use it for AC and don't want to turn on the AC and close the windows unless the temperature dictates.
3,Decent bar but less storage,"Couple of pieces were missing and the stoppers for the side doors is at the wrong place, the wooden drawer piece for keeping glass/bottles not correctly carpented. Overall storage is lesspro - looks good, compact when foldedcons - time consuming setup, less storage"
4,Gorgeous but fiddly to assemble,"This bar is beautiful and perfect for the space I have. It is substantial and well-designed. I think the cost is very reasonable, too. The ONLY drawback is that it takes a long time to assemble. I'm grateful to other reviewers who mentioned this. I'm glad I bought it and have no regrets, but it does take time and patience to put together."
2,"finish is very cheap,","finish cheap , nicks and dent on top and front panel, hardware not very good screws heads strip out before you can get them tight"
1,Rubbish remakes,"My copy doesn't have any warning about original artists, but these are not all the original versions. I bought this for three tracks- ""Kind Of A Drag"", ""Lightning Strikes"" and ""This Diamond Ring"", all of which are re-recordings that lamely attempt to mimic the original, but the vocals are dead giveaways. I grew up in NY listening to these hits and I know the difference. Save your money for a legitimate set."
1,Not So Good,I bought these Skechers shoes few years ago and not so impressed. The so called leather split in half within 2 weeks of owning them so now I just go to the actual store and buy them because I can't live without Skechers. Thanks
1,Not Happy,This pair of shoes split down the seam after only wearing them twice. I returned them to Amazon. I will not purchase another pair of these shoes.
5,Fantastic Commuter Light-Great Company,"I've been in the bike business for years and have had opportunity to use a majority of the different brands of bike lights on the market. This Planet Bike LED light is one of the best commuter models I've used. For night MTB riding Niterider is still the best, but these lower power LED models are entirely easier to use and maintain for most commuter use. It's a great light from a great, socially responsible company. Thanks Planet Bike!Planet Bike Super Spot 1-Watt LED Bicycle Light"
3,"Nice, bright front light, but doesn't blink","This front light is bright, provides a great field of vision at night, and is a nice value. My major problem with it is that it doesn't blink. Enhancing motorist's ability to see you from both the front and the back is important. I've been hit twice during the day by people left turning into me when they clearly didn't see me from the front. A back blinker doesn't help here, and a front white light that doesn't blink doesn't help much either. If you do a lot of road riding and you use this front light, you should also invest in another front light that blinks for daytime riding (Planet Bike Superflash Blaze is EXCELLENT and can mount on your front fork). Also, if your drop down handle bars have a large diameter on top, as many of the new handlebars do, this light's mount won't fit around your handle bars."
1,Not recommended,"I was highly disappointed by this documentary.I am more of a backpacker, so I found this documentary lacking a lot of content.He even dedicates a full minute to talk about how he dropped his camera into the river at the floating market.At the beginning there is a basic description about the culture and religions. Useful information: he claims 95% of population in Thailand is buddhist, but there is also a considerable amount of population that practice Hinduism. When you go, do not touch the monks and, if you go to a buddhist ceremony, make sure to cover your arms and legs (out of respect).Other than that he mentions places that can easily be found in the Lonely Planet guide."
1,Overexposed and overpriced,"Why pay first rate for a fourth rate production? The video is largely overexposed, and the Thailand that you get to see is basically one trip taken by one person. So, if HE didn't happen to film it on THIS trip, it won't be there. And, of course, no aerial or underwater shots...they take money and talent. A better title would be ""How I Spent Your Money Taking A Trip in Some Small Part of Thailand."""
3,Good if you love Thailand,"I liked the video footage of Thailand. If you love the LOS, then you'll likely enjoy this. The narration is horrible, mispronouncing every thai word, but again the video footage is good. If this person has really been to Thailand 7 times like he or the narrator anyway states, why is every thai word totally mispronounced. Also the mention of Walking Street as being just a motorcycle ride away in Bangkok, is totally wrong. Walking Street is a couple of hours away in Pattaya. Anyway, I love seeing anything thai, so I did enjoy it."
3,Reel To Real/Brief Encounters,"This is a ""live"" album with all that entails. Marillion/Fish always do a wonderful job before an audience. The music can stand without all the studio tricks. If you buy this ablum for no other reason buy it for ""Forgotten Sons"" and ""Cinderella Search"" these song were made to be heard live."
2,Nowhere near as good as the orriginal,"I was a huge fan of the first dungeon siege. The mod capabilities of the game made it wonderful and I was looking forward to a better dungeon siege experience with this game.I was terribly disappointed. You are forced to do the quest line, and cannot start a MP game at various points, only at the beginning unless you save the game every time. If you want to play with another friend, you have to start at the beginning. They took every negative aspect of the first DS and removed every positive and put it in this title."
3,HMMMM,"Though I do enjoy RPG's. I have yet to play this. I bought it as a present for my nephew. I do have another copy if it, and it is fun to a point. Not as much fun as the others."
4,Nice Sequel,"Haven't reached into the expansion pack of the game yet, but I'm really enjoying it. If you're a fan of the original Dungeon Siege game, this is a pretty good continuation of it."
4,"""Have fun stormin' the castle, boys!""","My son and husband are the warriors in the family, and they say, ""Game play is a combination of Neverwinter Nights meets Diablo II. It's fast-paced and versatile."" As far as I (the purchaser) am concerned, well, I would say they have gotten their money's worth! I would dare say they come really close to playing it ALL THE TIME! So, good product! And ""please make another!"" NOTE: Husband's 68 year old mom is now the official Guru of Dungeon Seige - everyone calls her for play advice."
3,"A Great, So-So Game.","This game is a great step up from the first Dungeon Siege. The graphics are decent, the leveling up is often enough and the character creation is good enough. However, the game itself is very monotonous. Every quest requires you to fight through several swarms of baddies. I find it boring to sit there while your party wails on your foes for a good three minutes, and that is if they are at equal or lesser level that you are. The only driving urge to play is to progress the storyline, but it isn't fun. The story is good, but not really worth the effort of running around to battle re spawning creatures. I have yet to get to the expansion ""Broken World"" and I am not sure I ever will."
3,poor condition,"I got the game from J&R Music and Computer World through amazon. The game arrived late and in a flimsy padded envelope, smashed up and crushed. The game CDs survived intact but have red ink from the retail game box stuck to the data side of the disks. I'm going to have to try to clean them up before i install it as I expect the terrible condition of the package is going to make a return difficult if not impossible. The one nice thing is that the broken world expansion pack is included in the deluxe edition. My advice: buy from amazon, not J&R Music."
2,Disappointing,"The game in itself is not too bad, an average game, I would say. Oblivion 4 is MUCH better. What is truly disappointing is the expansion pack, I have never been able to make it work, the game shuts down each time I try to launch the expansion pack."
1,NO CD KEY IN PACKAGE!,"I got the game from J&R Music and Computer World through amazon, It did not come with a CD Key, so I Cannot rate the game. All I have now is a set of 6 Coasters for my drinks. The box looks nice though."
2,Unhappy with this Game,I was not told nor was I able to read anything about by installing the game it would erase all my DS-II characters. I have uninstalled the game and thinking very hard on selling it to some other poor sap. How ever it was delived on time and in good shape and that's the best part of the game.
1,POOR,"Dungeon Seige was arguably the best game on the market, but Dungeon Seige II is a poor rendition of the the origional. I threw it in the garbage it is that bad!"
4,The double print says it all. The best band in the world,1981-87 and not bad since and beforethose digits! Rock On! And bring backBrant!...Or Comita
1,Out of Date,"This was a good book in the 90s, but is out of date now. It was in good condition and what I ordered, but the title was a bit misleading."
4,interesting but slightly dated,"The description of typical games that people play still holds relevance. I recognized myself and my friends in at least 8 of the games mentioned. However, the games sound a bit dated, as though the modern versions have evolved and mutated somewhat from the ones he describes from 50 years ago. I'd like to see a new version with more and expanded games. Possibly a website or wiki where people can record them as they are discovered. Life Tropes? Relationship Tropes? Like television tropes only for real life."
2,Impractical,"I hate giving bad reviews because I somehow feel unqualified. But, I bought this book because of all the good reviews, and I feel I've waisted my money. I must admit, I did enjoy the section on Structured Analysis. It is an interesting theory.First of all, this book was written in the 70's, so the writing style is old. Secondly, the book is too mathematical, which made me wonder whether the author was talking about robots. Finally, the ""games"" outlined are very vague and impractical. I believe this book is only useful for therapists. But, here in the real world, it isn't useful.Overall, I do not recommend this book (Unless you are studying psychology, and then I would recommend: ""Scripts People Live"", by Claude Steiner, instead). If you are looking for a practical book (and modern) that deals with people and their games, then I would recommend: ""Emotional Vampires: Dealing with People Who Drian You Dry"", by Albert Bernstein.I give this book 2 stars for the section on Structured Analysis."
1,Irrelevant and dated,"This book really shows its origins in the white middle-class sixties. The ongoing assumptions that all men are bread-winners and all women are stay-at-home wives who organize kaffeeklatsches and card (and gossip) parties became quite annoying. Tired sexual stereotypes abound. It may be great reading if you really care to analyze Ward and June Cleaver, but it won't tell you much about the world or its inhabitants today. Dull."
2,Sorely Disappointed,"For a minute I thought I had chosen the wrong book. It definitely did not live up to the rating for me. I was left bored and confused. At first I thought it was my timing. So, I picking it up again. I soon realized that this book wasn't for me. I rarely give reviews, but feel obligated to do so when I feel that a book is misrated or is hyped more than it delivers. Anyway, I would suggest a thorough review before you invest in this book. Maybe check it out from the library first."
2,Like reading math equations,"This book seems to have some good content. I was disappointed to find the writing style less than engaging. I admit I couldn't make it more than one chapter without falling out of my chair fast asleep. When I woke-up I skimmed a few more chapters and fell back to sleep. Maybe the book has a big exciting ending??? I don't know, but I'll leave that for someone else to find out. I'd give it less stars, but I'm sure pontificating professors will find it a page turner. Good luck."
4,An excellent manual for avoiding communication traps.,"Despite its success as a pop-psychology offering in the seventies and dialogues with titles such as, ""Now I've Got You, You S.O.B."", this is a serious and valuable work. Based on the Freudian concepts of Id, Ego, and Super Ego, Berne states that all comunnications may be classified as being Child, Adult or Parent in nature. We may be drawn into the ""game"" that another creates unless we are able to recognize the nature of the communication and convert it into an Adult to Adult dialogue.It is advisable to read this book out of sequence and to digest the theoretical explanation in the appendix before reading the games.In summary, a very useful manual for maintaining rational discussion in all interpersonal situations."
3,"Not what you'd expect, perhaps","When I finished this book, my immediate reaction was one of disappointment. It attempts to treat its subject more scientifically than is practical -- sometimes the ""players"" are identified, and sometimes they are not, sometimes the game has an antithesis and sometimes it does not. Berne would like to pretend that all of the games are structurally analogous, but it becomes clear that this is simply not so.Interestingly enough, though, disappointment though it was, I don't regret reading this book one bit. I started to see some of these games going on around me, and I was able to identify other games that weren't mentioned in the book. The whole book reinforces an important concept -- that people can act and interact for reasons that have nothing to do with their own happiness.Read the book and you'll understand, though perhaps not right away."
5,One of the best books of relationships,"This is one of the best books on relationships. After you read this, you will understand what is really going on in human interaction. It will make you see people and the way they behave in a totally new way. This book has helped me deal with other people so much better (both with my family and work)! I absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in understanding relationships. I recently also came across a book that deals with this issue that makes even more sense! It is called ""Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence"" by Toru Sato. It is superb! I gave it to my friends and they all loved it too!"
3,psychoanalysis for the masses,"An intro to interpersonal games and scripts. Don't expect any depth, though."
2,A Question...,"Why should this book be included in a list for ""aspiring Shakespearian actors""? As one who is a professional actor (Shakespearian and otherwise), acting coach and one who has read the book, I cannot see how this could possibly be connected to acting. Perhaps the recommender could expound on this thought?"
3,"Installs easily, works moderately...","If you need an Ethernet port in an area where wireless won't work and you can't get a wire, this is a solution. It is easy to install, however, I have found the throughput swings widely, I'd guess, due to whatever else is going on on the power lines in my house. I've had these installed in an area where they worked well for a year, then suddenly worked very sluggishly with no known reason.They do produce a moderate amount of heat like a regular router or WIFI device does, and that all being said it's worth consideration if you need a solution, keeping in mind is is a little bit of a toss up whether it will work for you and for how long it may work well given your environmental/power line conditions."
1,Speed is MUCH worse than my 85 mbps Asoka PlugLink Powerline Ethernet Adapters,"The speed is advertised at 85mbps. I also have two Asoka PlugLink 9650 85Mbps HomePlug Powerline Ethernet Adapters rated at 85mbps. Guess what? When I do an internet speedtest using the netgear adapters I get a speed of 1.5mpbs. Keeping everything else exactly the same(same cables, etc.), when I use the asoka 9650 powerline adapters instead, I get a speed of 5 mbps!What else needs to be said, its obvious the Asoka are superior. THE ACTUAL SPEED OF THESE IS A JOKE, might as well use wireless or purchase the Asokas."
1,This product did nothing for me.,I currently have 2 computers and use a wireless router for broadband connectivity. The router and the second computer are on the same floor of my home--about 3 rooms apart. I was receiving a low response connectivity on this second computer so I purchased the powerline adapters (I purchased 2 adapters and installed these according to the vendor's directions) based on other's glowing reviews and recommendations.This product did absolutely nothing for me. My poor response/connectivity was the same either with or without the Netgear adapter so it was very disappointing.
5,NETGEAR XEB1004 85 Mbps and NETGEAR XE103 85 Mbps working great,"I connected one NETGEAR XE103 85 Mbps to my DSL router, I connected my Directv HD DVR and my Media PC in the family room to one NETGEAR XEB1004. I connected 2 Laptops and one desktop to another NETGEAR XEB1004 in my home office, and one NETGEAR XE103 to an Ethernet Webcam. I have a total of 6 devices connect to the internet with NETGEAR powerline adapters and they are working superbly. Prior to this my wireless was saturated. I never picked up an manual or a CD...true plug and play. All have been working for one week. On 05/20/09 we had a power spike and then an outage. When the power came back on all NETGEAR powerline adapters were functioning correctly as well as the electronics connect to them. I am 100% satisifed with the NETGEAR powerline adapters. If you have questions email me at ds[DOT]ssnv[AT]gmail[DOT]com."
2,Very slow,"This networking product is very slow. The utility it comes with reports 50 megabits, but I am get less than 10 via everyother network benchmark."
2,Inconsistent performance...,"I was excited about this product, but was disappointed when I hooked it up. It hooked up in a matter of seconds, and I was pleased to find that it connected to my router right away. I was surfing the net in no time.But, within 5 minutes my connection got lost. Then it would come back, then it would drop...very frustrating. I got tired of it and packed it up and sent it back."
1,Worked great and then it just quit...,I previously gave this unit 5 stars and wrote a great review -- but now I have changed my mind. After about 5 weeks the units just quit!!! Nothing changed at all at home with my wiring -- nothing. Won't sign on at all. I was so excited about the flexibility of not having the be connected to the DSL modem -- I am now even better off -- I installed cards in my PC and two macs and installed an Airport Express unit and in less time than hooking but the netgear I now function with no wiring. Now I have 3 netgear units that don't work and know not what to do with them.
3,Great idea; fair implementation,"Ethernet over power is a great concept and I could have used this; I purchased two of the netgear adaptors and located them roughly 75 feet apart and got marginal connectivity (about 3mb/s.) It was sufficent for my purposes, but a far cry from their advertised capability. I noticed if you locate the adaptors closer (ie, same wall, or opposite wall in other room) the bandwidth they deliver gets order of magnitude better - approaching 10mb/s (over a 1gb/s backbone negotiated down to 100mb/s)Biggest flaw is the latency injection and broken packets; also one adaptor died after about 6 months and I had to purchase a replacement. So buyer beware. After giving them another 3months use I chucked them and went completely wireless with the Airport extreme."
3,Netgear Port Switch,"The switch works well although if you use a longer network cable than the one provided, the transfer speed slows down. It makes an easy way to network in the house."
1,NO WAY!!!!!,"do not buy this item, do not believe the good reviews. It does not work, my belkin delivers better through put then this does. i was excited to see that now i could finally stream some video to an area where i cant use wireless and i cant get cat 5 cable into, i had been using belkin and gettin a solid 11 mbps which is as advertised, using this 85mbps whiz bang i get 7 and 8 mbps. my video actually is worse using this alleged faster product. netgear should be ashamed of themselves. if you are an attorny looking for a cause this one could be your payday."
4,"Julius, the Baby of the World","Lilly, an active mouse, stars in Julius, the Baby of the World, by Kevin Henkes.It stars Lilly who loves Julius. But when he is born she hates him. She hates how her parents kiss his wet pink nose and how they stroke his soft white fur and admire his small black eyes. Lilly has to share her room. They want Julius to grow up big and strong like Lilly. But when her parents aren't looking, Lilly has her own ideas. Lilly's parents are doubtful about leaving them together alone. Lilly scares him and ignores him. Lilly spends more time in the uncooperative chair. Lilly hates him, but her parents love him. She warns her friends about him and other people.My opinion is if you like a nice humored book with good pictures, this is your book. I love the way the colors work together. So go...get Julius, the Baby of the World."
2,"At first good,but then.....",At first the book is good.After that the book gets a little dumb.I mean c'mon at frist she deosn't like him but when their cousin talks sqwot about him she tries to defend him and make her say ''Julluis is the baby of the world''.Witch was really dumb and odd.Also it uses unkind words like ''hate''.Get Chester's Way instead.
5,Great book,I bought this book for my niece. She just became a big sister and this book was recommended to me for her. It is a very cute book with a great story.
1,Awful,"This book was given to my two-year-old while I was 8 months pregnant with my second child. After I read through it once, it quickly ended up at the Goodwill.Lily's behavior is supposed to be interpreted as funny, but it is downright awful. She says things like, ""I hate you. You're ugly."" We all know that toddlers are parrots, so why in the world would anybody want to introduce this kind of behavior to them?We have a few other books by Kevin Henkes that we really enjoy, so I was extremely disappointed that this book was such a bummer. We love Usborne's ""The New Baby"" if you're looking for a book that will appropriately prepare your toddler for a new sibling."
4,Does what it says...,"This product does exactly what it says. You put it in the USB port and it moves the mouse around on the screen very very quickly. Each movement is probably about 75 pixels in a random direction and the mouse pointer jumps from position to position rather than moving from one to another.If you are getting this item to play a prank on someone, it is great. If you are getting it to keep your computer from going to sleep and/or locking due to inactivity, you would probably be better off using the slow version. The slow version you can leave in the USB port the entire time and you will never notice as it moves the mouse 1 pixel at a time and about once every 15-20 seconds."
4,Keeps Office Communicator Green,"If you are looking to be able to use your mouse with this plugged in, this is not for you. However, when you don't want your communicator turning yellow every time you go to the bathroom, this is for you. I plug it in when I walk away, I pull it out when I get back. Reviews of the Slow version of this, say it won't keep Communicator Green."
1,Fast version: useless,Ordered this Fast version nor realizing that there is a slow version that keeps computer awake and usable. The Fast version moves the cursor around widely and quickly as to make the computer unusable.
1,junk,"very expensive ink! only lasts for maybe 20 pics! has ink cartridge problems always saying buy new lexmark cartridge or order from lexmark . the last straw was when i bought a new black after 2 weeks of use printing receipts etc. no pictures it quit working all it says now is left cartridge incorrect tried everything. purchased new cannon nice machine!! always had cannon printers should have stayed with them. cant even sell it for $10.00!! putting lexmark printer under wheel of my truck and running it over! don't not buy lexmak stay away $30.00+ each ink!! junk scrap,, waste of good Chinese plastic"
4,Lexmark Printer X5470,I was a bit nervous purchasing this printer as I had read many mixed reviews. I have Windows Vista.Do not believe people that say it is NOT Vista compatible it is.The installation was simple.....works great.This is not a heavy duty printer and I would not recommend it for folks with a major amount of use.I am self employed and contract as a Virtual Receptionist for Dental Offices.I print about 2 12 page list a week. It is perfect for my print load.It is good quality. And functions very well.
2,Fine with Vista Home Premium. Awful with Mac 10.5 Leopard,"Have had this printer for 3 months. Used with a laptop (running on vista home premium) mainly as a printer. Installed Adobe Photoshop elements which is great for scanning. Fax is straightforward too.I have also a Macbook running on Leopard 10.5.2 and the using the Lexmark All-In-One Center software (provided on printer CD) is VERY buggy. It has a 50% success rate on the scan without preview mode, but near 0% with preview scan. I cannot do a preview scan and adjust scanning settings which is terrible. The scanner cuts out at the end of the progress bar and causes software to 'unxepectedly quit'. Even the preview scan is disabled in Apple's Image capture (version4.0) software. Maybe I'll have to try photoshop for Mac??Also you cannot use NON-Lexmark ink cartridges. It refuses any different 'compatible' brand.So I got to use vista home premium to get results. Such a shame it cannot perform on both software platforms."
3,"Great price, but...","Great price, but some nits:1. Worked fine on my spouse's XP laptop. Just-plain-wouldn't-work on my new Vista PC, even starting with fresh Vista drivers. Tech support tried their best, but no dice.2. Fax function is shaky -- the flatbed scanner feeder really does not work well with multiple pages. Works fine if scanning a single-page fax or document, but not if multiple."
5,Good Basic Printer/Copier/FAX,"After two disappointments with brand new HP all in one printers, I read everyones reviews and got this one. It works great, was very easy to program, and the media slots on the front are handy. If your looking for a top quality photo printer look elsewhere, but if your like me and use a printer 99% of the time for text/copies/FAX, this is the machine for you.One proviso, the ink cartridges are pricy, the xtra large black ink, and the xtra large colored ink combo packs runs $50."
1,Not Happy!!!!,"The order was placed on the 7th of dec. Today is the 18th(still no package) Expidited shipment, what a joke."
1,Crap,I've owned this printer for a couple years. I hate it. It eats ink and the cartridges will expire when not empty. It won't allow you to use refilled cartridges from the refill stores and you can't refill them on your own because they won't work. The Scanner is slow and the fax is difficult to use. I get mad any time I have to do anything but print. As soon as this last cartridge of black runs out I'm tossing it in the trash. I'll NEVER buy Lexmark again I feel like they saw me coming on this one. I had an old HP that i wore out I'm looking to get something that doesn't ink me out of house and home...
2,Finepix 3800 doesn't fit,"I also was disappointed that ... this bag [was listed] as an accessory for the Fuji Finepix 3800 - the bag is TOO SMALL for this camera. Even with the lens adaptor ring off, the bag is still TOO SMALL. ... THe bag is nice quality, too bad it didn't work out. ..."
3,OK for a small camera...,"I selected this bag based on the ""other customer's shopped for..."" links, with my recent purchase of a Fuji FinePix 3800. Upon receiving it, I tried to S Q U E E Z E my camera in, including removing the lens protector ring. No dice. I may try for this one's big brother, the DC 73."
4,Ganesh Valliappan (CA),"The case is built sturdy and would definetly protect a camera from jolts from the outside world, but for small camera's like my s400 and my casio M2 im afraid it would be bumping around insde. Would try what Kenneth J. Halliwell mentioned abt the s400. Overall the case is really spacious i would say. It may make life a little difficult when walking around with this attached to your belt. :-) it seems a little big when i look at it and the s400 is so small that the s400 fits in the front pouch meant for accessories neatly!!!"
4,Excellent social history of daily life in 1700 London,"Oops, I meant to give this five stars, but the software won't let me change my rating. I thoroughly enjoyed this author's ""London 1945,"" so I wanted to read her treatment of this earlier era. It's amazing that one person can be so knowledgable of social history of such disparate periods. The author introduces us to every aspect of daily life in 1700 London using a very readable style of writing.Here are the chapter titles (in some instances, I've paraphrased): 1) Marriage, 2) Childbirth, 3) Childhood, 4) Disease, 5) Death, 6) The Home, 7) Fashion, 8) Food, 9) Coffee-houses & taverns, 10) Amusements, 11) Work, 12) The Poor, 13) Foreigners, 14) Religion, 15) Vice, and 16) Crime & Punishment. There are almost fifty b&w; illustrations."
2,pass on this one,"I thought the information was just too general and basic. It's an okay video, but I don't think it's worth the $20 that I paid for it."
3,Kayak Fishing on a Wilderness System Kayak,"The title should be ""Fishing on a Wilderness Kayak.""The DVD was well done and there is a lot of useful information on it."
3,beautiful but fragile,I really liked the way this bracelet looks but it was much to0 pliable I guess is the word... the stress of putting it on and off weakened it until if finally broke in two near the little gold part... the up side is I got this bracelet in January and sent a message about it breaking yesterday ( june 5 ) and I got an email from Novica saying they were sending a prepaid return label and would credit my account... so the customer service was excellent....
1,STRICTLY THE WORST,"This is by far the most homophobic records I've ever heard. Out of the 16 songs, eight of them are homophobic: Girls Time, Warlord World, Ganja Smoke, Punnany Medley, To The Point, Hunt You, Damn!! and Roll Deep. The last five advocate murder. They dare to call this compilation 'Strictly The Best', if that's the case, the dancehall scene was really bad in 2000.[...] If you want to know more about homophobia in dancehall music, visit my website: www.soulrebels.org/dancehall.htm. [...]. They tarnished the image of the reggae industry. If you want a good reggae/dancehall record with no stupid lyrics, the best compilation that I found lately is: Ghetto Arc Presents: Serious Times (label: XL Recordings) (2006)"
1,Murder Music,"If you like music that advocates killing gays and lesbians, this has a number of bloodthirsty tracks. In Damn, Beenie Man sings ""I'm dreaming of a new Jamaica, come to execute all the gays"". In Roll Deep, he urges people to take up bazookas to kill gays. Capleton and Sizzla also encourage murder in their songs! Perfect to listen to with mom![...]"
5,A helpful and inspriational book.,"I found this book to be just the thing I needed to get started writing the journal I always wanted to keep. The author has shown me not only the how and why of journal keeping, but the many benefits to be derived from journals. In the first week, I began seeing some of the benefits in my own life. I recommend this book to all!!!!!!"
1,The worst Samsonite ever had,"I purchased this Luggage in Samsonite outlet in California. With my bad luck or poor quality of the bag EACH TRIP I have some crack or smashed corners. After 4 long haul trips I have to throw away the Luggage. It's not worth money I pay. By the way, I used this Luggage only for the long haul trips. Will look for another brand."
4,Arrived on time,"The suitcase arrived quickly and was as advertised. I haven't taken it on an airplane yet, but hope it will hold up on my upcoming trip."
5,Transaction complete,That was a book that I was lookking for many years. Excelent price a very good condition for a old book.Thank you
4,most excellent,"Every cut on this cd is worth a listen..even to those who are ""smoothjazz"" fans.Worth the money ...Paul does an excellent job of capturing a myriad of emotions."
3,Once Again,This Man is one hell of a Writer-Producer but once again another disappointment.Buy his first album and then Compare.
1,Not impressed,This item did not meet the standards I was expecting. I usually switch to another phone rather than talk on this one as it does not have good quality reception. I would not buy another one or recommend it.
1,Not worthy of the Uniden name,This phone has horrible voice quality and tons of static; not typical of Uniden phones but apparently this model is a lemon.Save yourself some headaches and buy something else.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is well edited and the articles she's chosen are fine, it's just that I was expecting the content of the articles to be suggestions and guidelines as to putting a garden together and not the thoughtful philosophies that Valerie shares. If you are looking for more of a gardener's journal with some beautiful pictures this book is perfect for you. If you want help in planning and planting a garden, look somewhere else."
1,Wack in '94. . .Still Wack in `06,"In high school ""Stroke You Up"" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even ""Stroke You Up"" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to ""Changing Faces."" The two chicks who made up ""Changing Faces"" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane."
3,MacAddct,"Great book, but not up to date.I'm running version 11'.Would be fine for older versionsLike version 9'"
5,These Days - Vince Gill,"This shows that Nashville record companies have really missed the ball. I have yet to see this album avertised in any local paper or record store ad, There was hardly any promotion with the exception of the Grand ol Opry people that recognizes his tremendous talent and devoted an hour of air time to his unheard of acomplishment. anyone else would have been screaming bloody murder, but this humble soul poured out his heart and soul into this 4 album masterpiece. and with absolutly no promotion nationally it is already platinum. This has to be a first in the record industry. Wake up Nashville !!! The old dogs still got it and you should jump on the bandwagon and promote older artist. I guess Vince said it best in his previous release of a song called "" It's a young man's town ""I for one hope this trend doesn't continue. Long live Vinnie and his talent. Mike Fitzgerald. Lima Ohio"
5,GREAT WORK,"THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST WORK THATTHAT VINCE HAS EVER DONE.GREAT WORKCHARLENE GIBBONSRIPLEY, TN."
2,No Matter How You Play It,"Vince Gill is a great artist, but this collection is not one of his best. He has gone the way of too many country artists by trying to be the new sound which only turns out to be sick rock. I gave the album away as I knew I would never play it again. I've gone back to playing Vince's old songs."
2,"Great voice, but everything sounds the same","Four disks, and all the songs pretty much sound the same. There is better country music out there."
2,Disappointing,"I sort of revered the special voice of Vince Gill, but this 4-CD special was a total disappointment. With some exceptions, all the songs sound a bit monotonous and if you do not pay careful attention to the lyrics, they tend to sound repetitive. In one CD this may be excused, but we are talking about four! And the invited vocalists are just that, invited. They are not given a chance to sing duets with Vince and relieve the monotony. Boring."
2,Disappointing lack of effort,"Let me say first... I am a great Vince Gill fan. However, this collection of tunes is in no way up to the high standards that he has set for himself throughout his career. Upon listening to this entire collection, I actually skipped through most of the songs after listening to the first 30 seconds or so, and even at that, I only remember 5-6 of the 40 or so songs in the collection. It seems like Vince went into the studio with his buddies, and really no plan, and just started recording takes. Then, they all sat around and said...hmmm... we don't really feel like putting in the time to cull this down to an actual 10-12 track album...so lets create some marketing hype and release them ALL in a collection.... sounds like a great idea... one problem... most of the songs are at best forgettable, and at worst pedantic, produced poorly, and hard to finish listening to. I am very disappointed in this sub-par effort, having been treated to Mr. Gill's high standards for years."
5,a 20star**************** collection...,"One of the best all-round collections of music I have ever heard. 5 starts for each disk.really really great set(s) of tunes. transcends musical style(s) and is simply a timeless selection of music.kind of like having an artist do his version of the black, red, white, and blue albums of the beatles and metallica (tongue & cheek but you know what I mean).wonderful lyrics for each mood of each disk, as well as the musical talent to back it all up with beautiful instrumental passages throughout."
4,"VINCE GILL ""THESE DAYS"" CD SET","GREAT VINCE GILL, NOT ALL TYPICAL VINCE, BUT STILL GOOD, THE COUNTRY CD IS THE BEST IN MY ESTIMATION."
5,Fantastic Collection,I love this collection. Vince Gill has proven that he can write and sing and play practically any kind of instrument and genre of music that exists. And the guest singers he chose are just right for the songs he chose them to do. I will wear these cd's out!! Vince is one of the few stars who is just another person. A person who cares about others and proves it by helping them. One of the greatest philanthropists of our time.
5,Best Vince Gill recording ever!!,Vince Gill's beautiful tenor soars and on other songs makes your throat tight from emotion on this CD. I consider this one of his BEST I've heard so far!
5,Glad I bought it,"I like every CD of this set. The music was good, nice arrangements and good musicians, plus Vince Gill's good guitar playing and singing. Very versatile musician this man is."
5,Not a country fan but I love this one so much....,"After seeing Vince on the two Clapton Cross Roads DVD's and liking him, my husband and I were intrigued. Then when I saw as he accepted his Grammy and put Kanye West in his place, I immediately said ""I want to support that man's music"". So I went on-line and ordered These Days from Amazon.My husband and I are not big country fans, but after lsitening to this, we've paid $20 to join Vince's fan club and are going to see him in Aug in Chataqua, NY.My fav disc is #2, which is not surprising since it is the least country. The duets and harmonies are fantastic. Disc #1 is the second fav - we would chill with Vince any day! Discs 3 & 4 are equally as good. What a great songwriter and artist Vince is, as well as a fine guitar player (if Clapton likes him, he has to be great, right?!)Country fan or not, I say buy this one!"
5,massive,"If you've written and recorded so many good songs then why bother whittling them down to 12-14 for a single, normal CD. Just do as Vince has done here and release all of them. No real suprises, just the usual top class country, as is always the case from Mr. Gill. The variation comes from the sub-genres and the liberal use of superb guests. Don't be put off by it's sheer size, for once it is matched with the quality."
2,The End of Her Solo Work,"Unlike Jane's three previous solo ventures, this one seems like a complete vanity project. Even the nude photos inside reek of a ""Look at me out here on the cutting edge of grrrl rock and not giving a damn about anything"" vibe. The music is generic angry chick rock and, let's face it, not having the fullest or strongest of voices, the instrumentation overwhelms her vocals. While others will likely disagree, I prefer the ""Blue Kiss/Rush Hour/World on Fire"" dance/pop fun Jane. I wasn't surprised that after this CD, her solo catalogue ended."
5,Starting over...,"Kissproof World is JW's most entertaining cd to date and a radical departure from her HORRIBLE 80's solo efforts. Gone is the intrusive sugar coated production of her past efforts which induced vomiting when coupled with sickly sweet by-the-numbers lyrics (Think FUR). Without a major label, Wiedlin finally sings/performs with some honesty and integrity.Give me ""Die Now Pay Later"" and ""Good Wife"" over ""Rush Hour"" or ""Blue Kiss"" any day.If you like this, check out her FroSTed CD which is a cross between the Go-Go's and Green Day."
5,Great sample of Alan Richman,"I consider Alan Richman the finest food writer out there and this book provides a sampling of the quality writing GQ and Bon Appetit readers have known for years.The article on dining at the Nation of Islam restaurant in Chicago is reason enough to buy the book. Richman manages to weave religion, racism, and social commentary into an article on a restaurant. Outstanding.Other outstanding essays in the book revolve around the disappearing Polynesian restaurant, the sad current state of Paul Bocuse in France, and the hilarious ""My Beef with Vegans.""Richman breaks up the articles with his ""Ten Commandments"" for both diners and restaurants, as well as ""Ten Reasons White Wine is Better Than Red.""All-in-all a fantastic book by a great writer. Richman has joined Steingarten, Villas, and Claiborne in reaching the mountaintop of fine food writing."
4,Entertaining & Fun,"Well written, funny and entertaining from front to back. Easy to read, somewhat short paragraphs and has a good pace. Well worth it."
