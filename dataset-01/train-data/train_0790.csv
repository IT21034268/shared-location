1,Shakir's translation is copy of Maulana Muhammad Ali's 1917 edition,"The Shakir translation is very largely a word-for-word copy of the 1917 (first) edition of Maulana Muhammad Ali's English translation of the Quran. For details please read this article:www.ahmadiyya.org/movement/shakir.htmThe name Shakir is most probably fictitious. He is supposed to have been an ""Egyptian judge"" (d. 1939) but that person could not have translated the Quran, as is shown in the above article.It cannot be imagined that its publishers are unaware that it is a work of plagiarism."
1,extremely flawed,-No footnotes-No commentary-Odd wording-Practically uselessTryThe Qur'an (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)instead.
1,Two paper cups and a string would work better,"These have to be the flimsiest radios with the worst reception around. If you only want to hear the monster megawatt station with top twenty, it will do. Everyone else, beware."
3,Works OK,"Hey, this ain't no iPod! This is a cheapo-beapo radio. Basically, it is something to listen to on the bus or while working out that you wouldn't mind losing. In addition, the radio makes a nice stocking stuffer for pre-teens. I'd just advise that you get an extra one just in case you need to return a dud. Finally, because the on-off switch is the volume control as well, it is darned easy to leave this radio on and kill the battery. And the tuning is imprecise. Geez, maybe I should rate it two stars... ;-)"
4,Portable AM FM pocket radio,"The size and convenience of the product is very nicely designed. The sound is not at good as larger and more expensive products, but that is to be expected. Since I just purchased it, I do not know what the future problems will be but so far I am quite pleased with the overall quality and convenience of the radio for my use in commuting."
4,Great little radio,This is a pretty good radio for the price. It's small and can be worn around the neck. I would buy it again.
3,headphones,"The headphones(ear piece) stopped transmitting any noise after a couple of days. I wanted to use it at work , where I only could hear it."
1,amazon is cheating,"amazon said this radio use AA battery, but actually it use AAA battery! i need buy new battery!"
5,Laugh with tears in your eyes,"No doubt - this is my favorite Steve Goodman album. From the biting satire of Watchin' Joey Glow, to the tongue-twisting Talk Backwards, to the still-timely Vegematic, he'll have you rolling in the aisles. Anyone who's parents ever took them to an ice show will have fond memories as well as chuckles to Old Smoothies. His duet, Souvenirs, with John Prine is one of his best. And especially if you know his history and love of the Cubs, A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request will bring a tear to your eye even as he shows you that nothing in life can't be overcome with a dose of humor. His Rowboat came in; don't miss yours and this album."
5,The Father of American Forensics,As a person who was involved in the laboratory aspect of forensics I see the very basics of an investigation at the forensics level. Dr. Helpern was a detail man and that is what distinguishes the professional from the amateur. Such a quality is what kept Dr. Helpern not only constantly busy but also extremely popular. His detailed examinations of a corpse determined the huge difference between a natural death and a homocide thus the difference between an innocent person sentenced to prison vs going free.
4,one of the best...,"Besides the big flop on saying the book of Jonah isn't missional (Jesus said it was, why don't they?), this is probably the best book out there on presenting a biblical theology of Missio Dei in the Bible you will find. The authors are in contrast to Walter Kaiser in that they do not believe Second Temple Judaism was a missionary religion. Judaism served to draw in the nations, not go out to the nations. That comes in the Acts of the Apostles. While in the OT the Jews were a light that drew the nations in for a closer look, in the NT, all believers are to go out as a light to the nations taking the salvation of the Lord to the ends of the earth.For the work on John and Paul alone, this book is worth having. Whoever thinks John isn't missional needs to read again. The standard Paul set for missions still stands today.If you want to round out your understanding of the Bible theologically, you should read this book."
3,Alright,"This was a well articulated book, but I'm not so sure I can agree with the author's conclusion. A ""center"" theology tends to be an overly simplistic way at looking at the Bible."
4,The Golden Age,"This is a must read for those of us of a certain age for which these were the Golden Age of Baseball, whether you loved the Yankees, Giants, or Dodgers (as I do the Dodgers) or hated them (as I I do the Yankees)."
4,"FINE, IF YOU LIKE PICTURES.","WHEN A KID, IT WAS ALL YANKS AND DODGERS. I LOVE BASEBALL AND THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE ME BACK TO WONDERFUL TIMES. WELL, IT DID IN PICTURES BUT LITTLE IN REALLY TELLING THE STORY."
5,An amazing book taught by an amazing teacher!,"My AP American History teacher in Miami took the rest of the time after the AP exam to teach us this book. The analysis by Haga on bureaucracy and the evil of breakloops is great. The humor is worthwhile and i look at the world in a completely different light. This year was this teacher's last teaching year. She is now retired and will no longer take time to teach this amazing book. Another reviewer above has also written about her, she is amazing. From all of your students at Dr. Michael Krop High School in Miami WE LOVE YOU MRS. GIBBS!!!"
5,Worth The (Extremely Affordable) Price,"...In my humble opinion, if you are primarily interested in blowing off the roof while you crank up the volume for rap music, then put the CD in your stereo.These speakers are not causing Dolby to lose sleep at night but for a home computer system, they are nothing short of excellent.Sleek, extremely lightweight and designed so they can fit almost anywhere, they are wonderful for any home/office. And the sound? Perfect. Test them with any of Amazon's audio clips while you are on-line and you can see how professional Altec Lansing made these.But what brings it all together is the price. For [a reasonable price], these perform better than most speakers that come with boom boxes and mini-audio systems.So, if you want concert hall sound, go to a concert hall. But if you want to upgrade from the (usually) shoddy speakers that come pre-packed with most computers, these are the ones to buy."
5,Transforms your PC into a Party Jukebox!!,"This speakers rock the roof of any room! Not just the high quality dome speakers, but the subwoofer, makes this set a great choice of sound and price combined. Your mp3 collection, the ATP3LA Speakers and some friends, let's party on!!"
5,Awesome new chapter in the rich Gi Joe history,"This movie will be enjoyed by kids, most Gi Joe fans as a whole and even anyone who is just fond of great animation. The CGI is the best I have ever seen in any US made movie. There will be some who will not like this and those people are the ""fans"" who are too narrow-minded to accept Gi Joe in new times and that it's not 1985 any more. Anyone who says ""this can't compare to the Sunbow series"" just simply doesn't get the idea that it's not supposed to compare. It's an entirely differnt time.The storyline on the surface can seem a little silly, but the writers have done an excellent job of putting the Valor Vs. Venom story to the screen. Mucho kudo to all the writers and animators. I personally liked Spy Troops as well, but this movie leaves it in the dust. Advice to anyone, buy the movie. If you're hesitant, check out your local video store and rent it. You are in for a treat and an awesome film."
1,Not for those who liked the original cartoon,"This was a huge disappointment. I understand there is a new generation of cartoon watchers and this is probably for that market. This cartoon really tries to introduce this new generation to this updated line of toys, vehicles, etc, but in the process they completely alienated those fans who grew up on the cartoon in the 80's. If you are looking for nostalgic GI Joe action, this is not it. If you want to show your children something that you watched when you were growing up, then this might be the ticket."
5,Terrific Animation,Action animation great!! I especially liked the Karate scenes - very realistic. The computer animators worked hard and it shows!! Buy this DVD and you won't be sorry!!
4,New CGi-Joe,"CGI-Animation make this new form of the GI-Joe saga look great but the writing tends to be minimal. Unlike some of the other CGI shows (Beast Wars) GI-Joe is still a kids show after all. I've watched the Valor Vs Venom DVDs as they have been put out in the toys and keep wishing they would just remake the original serious with the new animation.All in all not bad, but I may be colloring my review with nosalgic glasses. If you are interested the DVD are also found in the Valor VS Venom Toys. Specifically the Storm Shadow Vs Snake eyes.Safe travels:David"
2,Can't Touch the Original G.I.Joe Cartoons,"As a big G.I.Joe fan, I couldn't wait to see this new cartoon. However, the computer animation is not that good (Destro's face look like more moulded jello then a steel mask) and the storyline is out of this world (very unrealistic). In fact, it appears that Hasbro has taken GI Joe back into the unrealistic world that killed the original GI Joe back in the mid-80's: meaning introducing crazy storylines mixed with out of this world characters.If you are a huge fan of the old 80's Sunbow series and are a big believer (like me) that the GI Joe movie killed the original 80's series, then you will find this new computer animated movie to be a waste of money (like I did).If you are new to GI Joe, I would recommend you pass on this movie and get the two original mini-series available on DVD as those two original mini-series are true to what made GI Joe so popular back in the 80's."
1,Not even worth the shipping cost.,"This failed attempt to resurrect the classic G.I. Joe series comes across with animation, story, and dialogue that belong in cheap game cut scenes. It had the potential of genetically modified Cobra troops and old-school characters reborn, but falls miserably short of the (admittedly already cheesy) quality of the original cartoon. Now, I am rather easy to please, and really enjoyed the old cartoon, but this film is mostly a string of mediocre action, weak character development (or involvement for those who already know them), and terrible puns at every turn. All told, the target audience should be more the 10 and younger crowd who have likely had no experience with real G.I. Joe. Current fans from around 20 or older will be sorely disappointed and should avoid the expenditure and wasted 80 minutes."
3,I missed the original series,"This is an all new G.I. Joe adventure for an all new generation, so I shouldn't except the same things. With that said, I still somewhat enjoyed this, but the use of CG instead of hand drawn animation is what really made me mad. It's not the worst CG I've seen, it was actually pretty good for a direct to DVD release, but it just seem too different from the old cartoon and comics to have it feel like the same series. Despite these problems, at a mere 77 minutes, I was able to sit and enjoy it as a free rental as the story itself was still classic Joe. If you want to rent G.I. Joe rent the original series, if you want something new get this one."
3,dios,read The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and lets put a stop to silly religious wars and the hate religion spreads
2,Tony and Salma where are you...,"I was disappointed, only because the music doesn't carry over the action of the movie. The main reason I purchased the CD was for the song that Salma Hayek sang...her voice is every bit as sensual and seductive as in the movie."
4,THIS SOUNDTRACK ROCKS,"A fitting companion to a great action film - the highlight of the CD is undoubtedly Tito and Tarantula's ""Strange Face of Love"" - whoever picked the tracks and produced this album (Rodriguez?) did an excellent job. Too many soundtrack albums sound like random selections of songs. This one feels like a great experience from start to end."
4,Get This Soundtrack,"Robert Rodriguez puts together a killer soundtrack that is in the vein of Dusk Unitl Dawn or Kill Bill. Great music that flows wonderfully. This CD has sat in the car CD changer for a month now and I still like it everytime.Lots of Los Lobos. A great song by Santana called Bella that is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever done by Carlos. The Dire Straights and Latin Playboys songs are also excellent. A great mix of music that blends styles and groups and keeps the whole CD interesting.If you like the Dusk Until Dawn soundtrack get this one - if you like this one, likewise, get Dusk Till Dawn.Rodriguez and Tarrintino rule!"
2,There were only a couple of good songs.,"Those couple of songs were really good, but there should be more than that on a CD. For me, the two I liked were worth buying the CD, but I won't rate very high because most of the CD sucked."
2,"Was going great, then CRACK","We bought this for use with P90X as well. My wife used it successfully going through it once, although I suppose she didn't apply as much pull as I was able to. Within 2 weeks of using it correctly, braced through a door (using a third-party door attachment, which was not the problem), the left handle plastic tube that feeds through the grip (which is hollow, and the nylon fabric passes through it) cracked. I was by no means pulling it so hard that it was equaling an actual pull-up, but it had a little tension at the bottom of the pull and I figured I'd use it for a few weeks and maybe get a heavier one later on or on a repeat of the program.Again, this wasn't a band-snap incident. This was the handle that cracked. By rotating that 1/2"" crack away from the nylon fabric running through, my wife can still use it, but if I give it another go it'll probably crack completely and be useless."
4,Reebok Heavy Braided Resistance Cords with DVD,"I wanted this for a totally new type of challenge, that is why I purchased this. For me it is a huge challenge, I am not using this with another product the DVD is enough for me. I doubt I will ever be able to do some of the routines like they do on the DVD, I can not get this over my head, but I will keep trying without getting discouraged. I think I am getting the same results as others who can. It has already transformed my arms, they look well defined without being overly muscular (I don't like that anyway). It's funny my husband can easily do all the arm routines but nothing else with this, it's too hard for him. This has whittled my waist down, my legs have always been strong, so they are very toned now, my ab is flat... I do wish the lady would explain more, this to me is a very fast paced routine and in my opinion not for anybody who is not already in good shape. I do like it a lot and use it every other day."
4,Good starter,This is a great introductory book for children learning about art. The pictures are large and the analysis of the paintings are not too in-depth for children. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a primer in Chagall's art.
2,Kindle review,"The poor resolution makes this comic nearly unreadable on a kindle. This is a great comic, just do yourself a favor and get the physical book."
1,Review for Kindle edition only,"This book is not formatted properly to work on the Kindle. The comic is almost unreadable. If you want this book do not waste your time with the kindle edition, buy the book."
3,Not on an iPad or a computer,"I had to enlarge most of the images to read them on an iPad (requiring 3 or 4 operations per panel). Very hard to read on the computer (I found no way to enlarge the panels on a Mac). I recommend a print edition for this one. That said, the content is enjoyable, hence the 3* (1 for usability; 5 for content)."
5,Well deserving of being a classic,"Very well written. Flows extremely well, especially towards the end of the book. Really shows the agony of the decision on the part of the Anglo-American allies to stop at the Elbe and not push on to Berlin. I think much of the information contained was new when this book was released nearly fifty years ago. While that is no longer the case, it is still fascinating reading. Heartily recommend to all World War 2 enthusiasts. In some respects, it can be thought of as ""required reading""."
5,Superlative account of Berlin's fall,"I'm more of a fan of historical war novels like The Triumph and the Glory, and rarely read non-fiction, but The Last Battle by Cornelius Ryan, which a fellow student recommended to me, is beyond compare. Too may in the West have never acknowledged the horrific struggle the Red Army endured to conquer Berlin. A fascinating book!"
5,Outstanding,Reading this book was as if I was standing right next to Hitler as the battle took place. I felt as if I was down in the Bunker. It has the same writing style as IS PARIS BURNING another great book about WWII.
4,Interesting review of the fall of Berlin,This book recounts in sometimes too much detail the events surrounding the fall of Berlin the discussion of the military objectives and strategies is excellent too much time is spent trying to show how difficult this was for the common person in Berlin and the soldiers who fought the battle nonetheless this is a very good book
4,Compelling history in the Cornelius Ryan style,"If you appreciated and enjoyed the style of ""The Longest Day"" then this is a necessary cap to the other end other story for D-Day marked the beginning of the end of the Third Reich and in this excellent narrative Ryan details the madness and horror of the final implosion of Hitler's Reich. As he so skillfully does, Ryan lets the participants, the great figures and the small, tell the story. Most importantly, Ryan helps to demolish some post-war myths. The Big Three had already decided on the partitioning of a post-war Germany and that explains why the Allied armies stopped where they did. It also explains how once the armies went ashore they were committed by the realities of logistics to their individual paths. The madness of Hitler's Reich was still evident in the dying embers of the last battle which demonstrates exactly why it was necessary to kill the regime completely."
4,Good overview with eyewitness accounts,"In-depth look at the battle for Berlin, particularly from an eyewitness viewpoint. The book's research broke ground in the 60's, and remains a solid read. The profile of General Heinrici was particularly illuminating."
4,ALISON MOYET,"EXCELENTE VOZ DE ESTA MUJER Y SOBRE TODO QUE HACIA MUY BUENA MANCUERNA CON SU ANTERIOR COMPAÑERO EN EL GRUPO YAZOO, PERO ESTA BUENO EL DISCO."
3,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed Amethyst Rock Star. It really took me aback and made me rethink my take on Hip Hop as a whole. Williams' latest however falls short in my opinion. I find it much less compelling and less musical (for lack of a better term) than his first. Perhaps if you're a big fan of his spoken word this album will be for you, as I find it much more ""beat poet"" than hip hop."
4,GOOLD ALBUM TO HAVE,"THIS ALBUM IS GOOD, I LOVE HIS MESSAGE AND I ALSO LIKE THE SONGS HE HAS IT'S ONLY A ONE SONG I DON'T LIKE BUT OVER ALL IT'S PRETTY GOOD I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN HIS FIRST ONE."
2,Not Just Another MC,"There are no ""interludes"" or ""skits"", but I would not call all 12 tracks ""songs"". Saul Williams showcases his talents as a rapper, a singer, and a spoken-word artist (he's also an actor). ""List of Demands (Reparations)"" and ""Grippo"" both have crazy beats; the rest of the songs are OK, but not nearly as remarkable. Still, he's deep, so prepare to dig it. Lyrics in booklet."
3,Run very narrow.,The other reviews said they run true to street shoe size. I disagree. They are in the general size are of street shoe sizing but run VERY narrow. If your feet are even a little bit wide these shoes are going to be a stretch for you to fit into.
3,Rather sharp ( old model),"I order those cheap shoes for dancers a show in Montreal .Shoes are rather sharp ( old model 1995 ). The final cost (transport and customs,) double the price(prize). It is not a real sale.. And this old style finally cost me around 90.00 !! ( Independently of the shape, those shoes are comfortable."
5,LOVE the Shoes!!!,"Not only are they comfortable, and gorgeous, and I love them, but everyone else loves them. I'm always getting asked where I got them from. Awesome purchase!"
5,Love These Shoes,"These were probably about my 15th or 20th pair of Capezios, but they were my first t-straps and my first online shoe purchase. I was a little worried that the leather on the toe box would be soft and prone to wrinkling like their Footlights but not at all. The leather is smooth and firm. They are true to Capezio's sizing, so if you fit a 7 in any other Capizio you'll fit a 7 in these. My high insteps don't affect the line of the shoe at all. The soles are the same as the Footlights, scored across the toe and ball with nailed heels. When these wear out, I will be happily buying another pair. These are my new favorite formal dance shoes."
3,"Good, but not Wide enough","I ordered these shoes knowing that Capezio means comfort. I actually wore them to a wedding in January and they were great. They looked wonderful with my dress. However, the 7W size was not wide enough. The shoe was rather narrow for ""Wide"" size. If you have a normal-size foot, then I highly recommend this shoe for a special occasion. They're made of leather and are therefore classy and comfortable.The size 7 was true to size, just not the width."
3,Looks good,"The Capezio shoe looks great, but had to send back. Even ordering a half size larger than my street shoe, it was too small."
2,"Nice concept, arm broke after 3 uses...","Loved the concept, I paid $50 for mine and was ready to hit the beach, the concerts, etc. Unfortunately, the arm broke while trying to get out of the thing. I'm 6ft 190 lbs and barely fit into the thing, but still, the arm should not have broken like it did."
2,Unstable on grass,"I loved the concept but found it to be disappointing. I wanted to watch soccer/ulitmate games on a grassy sideline. I find the leg(s) in the back to have too narrow of a footprint. It just tips too easily. It might be great in the sand, where it could dig-in a little, but not on a solid surface. The seat is okay but the shade seems a little flimsy in the wind."
5,Good but what about the Metal Messiah's ?,EXCELENT CD GOOD SONGS BUT WHAT ABOUT METALLICA? THEY SHOULD AT LEAST PUT IN MASTERO OF PUPPETS.
3,Would've given it more stars....,Had they not left off God Bless Video by Alcatrazz. I love that song and I loved cruising around listening to it on the game. This was the only station on there that i listened to. lol. Good stuff. But would've loved to given it more stars had they not left off that one song.
3,eh,"This album could be so much better. To deny Joey Burns his vocal gift is to...well, deny the best of music and the best of Calexico. Sam is a little too breathy, sensitive and emasculated for my tastes. ""History of Lovers"" is probably the best tune on the album. I saw Calexico + Sam at a Calexico show at Castle Clinton over the summer and, sadly, when Sam stepped onto the stage, an otherwise rollicking show was brought to a screeching halt for about five tunes.Like Calexico's appearence on ""Los Super 7"", it's a waste to make them a backing band. They're superb at providing support but why waste them as a group of studio musicians? They're so much better operating as Calexico."
4,Broken Bed,"Za postovaoce benda Iron and Wine ovo ce biti pravo uzivanje, za nas koji volimo Calexico manje vise. Ustvari kada bolje razmislim ne znam ni zasto je bend Calexico potpisan na albumu In The Reins. Sve u svemu od sedam pesama koliko se nalazi na ovom izdanju izdvajaju se dve: A History Of Lovers i Burn That Broken Bed."
4,Nice Collaboration,"I'm a fan of both Calexico and Iron and Wine. On ""In the Reins"", there is a lovely mix of both. ""He Lays in the Reins"" is powerful and uses the vocal talent of Salvador Duran to great effect. The EP's ""weakest link"" is ""Prison on Route 41"", although the song is stronger when performed live. ""History of Lovers"" is melodic and deftly blends the styles of Calexico and Sam Beam. ""Red Dust"" is well done. The powerhouse of the EP to me is ""16, Maybe Less"". This song just tugs at the strings of the heart and brings back memories of love long past and yet to come. The blending of Sam Beam and Joey Burns' voices is amazing and has the capacity to bring on the chills. ""Burn that Bed"" and ""Dead Man's Will"" are both excellently done. This is a terrific outing by both Iron and Wine and Calexico and is actually a good introduction to both. Listening to this makes me want to listen to more Calexico and more Iron and Wine, and I was already a huge fan of both to begin with!"
5,Great kite just what I needed,"I bought it for a KAP system, and it works great, I flew it behind my sailboat and was able to get some great pictures. Kite is easy to fly, and packs small. I love it."
5,This will become your shoe of choice!,"This is one of the best shoe purchases I have ever made. Not only is this sandal smart-looking, it is downright comfortable, even for long walks and for wearing hours on end. I've had many people ask me about my shoes, and I'm quick to recommend them. I bought the smooth leather ones in tan. I particularly like the fact that they have a removeable insole that you can wash by hand. (Yes, sandal insoles do get dirty quickly and look pretty yucky). I just use a tad of liquid laundry detergent on an old toothbrush to scrub the insoles. They air dry very quickly, and the shoes look like new again! One more thing--they're great for air travel, since you can undo and do the Velcro fasteners so easily at Security. One warning: They may spoil you against wearing any other shoes!"
2,A Disappointment,"I was looking forward to the possibility of a ""walking sandal."" Unfortunately, these sandals did not do the trick for me. They are well made and of quality materials. The problem is in the sizing. The heel is much larger than I expected it to be. I was tempted to think that perhaps I had purchased the wrong size but no, the width and length were fine. Only the heel was too wide. They just didn't work for me.Your experience may be different."
3,Propet Shoe,"I returned this shoe because the size ran small and the color did not appear as I thought. However, it was a very comfortable shoe and the price was right. I really don't like returning items because you always lose money."
2,Propet Women's Pedic Walker,"Unfortunately I had not purchased Propet brand shoes prior to this purchase. I found that they run smaller than other similar brands. Therefore, I couldn't wear the shoes and due to an illness I could not get them returned within the 30 day frame. I won't purchase shoes from Amazon again."
4,very comfy,good for walking around the house or for traveling. True to size. Gave it a 4 star because it is not a good looking.
2,Runs Small - Return Shipping is Extra,"The Propet Women's W0089 Pedic Walker Sandal seems nice, but it runs very small. Normally, my mother wears a size 10 1/2, but she'd need a 12 in this, and this doesn't come in a 12 (an 11 was way too small; her toes overlapped the end of the sandal).The worst part is that I had to pay for return shipping back to FootSmart. If this purchase would've been directly through Amazon, it would've been so much better. They pay for return shipping on things that don't run according to size. Buying from FootSmart is NotSmart."
4,"nice shoe, runs short and wide",This walker feels great and is of excellent quality with the exception that my toes are too long for the shoe and rub up against the end. I ordered a half size up but I could have used more length. The shoe is quite wide for my boney feet and I have to tighten the shoe straps which are uncomfortable over my high arch. Overall it would have been helpful to try them on first.
3,Stitching,"The sandal is very comfortable if not wearing for long periods of time. The stitching around the heel eventually rubs the skin around your heel raw. I bought for work and cannot wear them that long, even after trying to wear them for short periods of time to get used to them."
5,Great Ssandals!,"These are absolutely fantastic sandals. I loved them so much that I bought a second pair. They are a perfect fit, the well-padded soles make walking or being on your feet a lot much more comfortable, and the ankle support you get from the enclosed heel is super. I bought the wide width, and they really are comfortable!"
2,I'm sending the shoes back!,I've been wearing Propet shoes for several years and I've always been pleased with them. In fact I have two other pair of these sandals in Brown and Black. So I felt safe buying another pair in tan thinking they would fit the same. These are a quarter of an inch shorter than my other ones! So my toes stick out a little beyond the sole and this is very uncomfortable. I'm very disappointed.
5,My favorites!,This is the second pair of these sandals that I have purchased in the last three years and I have been very satisfied with each purchase. The size is true to fit. Plenty of support and room for extra supports as well. I have the worst feet and these are my favorite sandals!
3,Must be released on DVD,The reason i bought this VHS was that i saw this show on TV (with introduction by Walt Disneh himself). I really scared of the quality of this old VHS stuff. Even on my professional multi-standard vhs player. I should have known because that series of tapes are probably 25 years old. I tried to save it digitally but it was useless. I hope they find the mastertapes of that ol' tv-series and they release it as a classic dvd.
4,Inquest,"An important book for even occasional assassination buffs. Often referenced by other writers on the subject. One of many books to demonstrate that the Warren Commission did nothing to help establish truth, and in fact was extremely effective in obfuscating the facts."
1,Much Ado about Nothing,"Epstein makes clear from the outset that he was not analyzing what the Warren Commission did, but how they did it. This is like analyzing the layout of the deck chairs on the Titanic. He committed some howlers along the way. On page 74 of the hardcover edition, he wrote, ""One bullet, which possibly was the fatal bullet, was too fragmented to be matched to Oswald's rifle by means of ballistics."" On page 88, he wrote, ""Bullet fragments found in the President's car were definitely matched by ballistics experts to the rifle found in the Texas Book Depository."" He was talking about the same bullet.The only virtue of Epstein's book is its brevity. You can read it ten times in the time it takes to pick up ""Reclaiming History."""
5,Well worth the wait!,"The way this fine author consistently brings her characters so vibrantly to life never ceases to amaze me and this novel is certainly no exception! Penman's depiction of (in my opinion) one of history's most dynamic duos, Henry the Second and his queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, was so compelling that at times I felt as though I could almost reach out and touch them. I also found her depiction of the engimatic Thomas Becket and the conflicts which arose between him and his king to be the most in-depth of any other historical fiction novel I've ever read to date ... and the only one that's given me any real insight into this 'driven' man who seemed, before all was said and done, to practically beg to be martyred. After finishing this novel, I perused W. L. Warren's non-fictional account of Becket in his book titled ""Henry II' and it only reinforced my feelings in this regard."
4,time and chance,"very good, historicaly sound with good characters.having read all her previouse works she maintains her high standards.it is obviously well researched"
4,Time and Chance,"For the last decade, I have gotten very interested in historical fiction. I value Sharon Penman's writing. Her books seem very well researched. I'm one of those readers who wants the historical details, names and places as well as the events and it doesn't hurt if there are personal details to spice up the history. Penman hooked me as I have an abiding interest in Eleanore of Aquitaine and am now on ""The Devil's Brood."" Have not been disappointed."
3,Lackluster depiction of Henry and Eleanor,"I love this author, but I have to say I was disappointed with this novel. Eleanor of Aquitane is such a popular historical figure - however, in this novel her character is extremely flat. After reading this novel, wondering why author started mystery series based on Eleanor? Maybe I will understand when the last novel of this trilogy comes out. Hopefully her character will be more fleshed out next time.This novel centered way too much on the battle between Henry and Becket - was somewhat tedious - would have rather Henry/Eleanor storyline had been the center focus - especially since she did not explain Thomas's behavior/point of view.I will definately read the last novel when it comes out, hoping will portray Eleanor and Henry's relationship in more detail."
2,Why so Expensive??? (kindle edition),"I have started reading Sharon Penman's novels. I have ordered a couple of her books on kindle, but I really wanted to read her trilogies. But upon looking at the kindle prices..... Boy are they expensive!!! Dont know if its even worth it to buy the kindle edition or just buy the paperback. I' m still finishing When Christ and his Saints Slept ( good book so far ). I would like to read her books in order but I will probably have to wait...."
4,A Good Read,"A fairly decent SKP book. I found her charactorization of Henry II a bit lacking and Eleanor a little too submissive and sad than I would have pictured her to be, but all in all a good read. Still waiting for the next one SKP, can't wait to see what you'll write about next!"
1,disappointing,"I loved Penman's other books but this one lacks Penman's usual magic. There are no interesting new characters, and the old ones have lost much of their luster.The most interesting subplot, the growing estrangement between Eleanor and Henry, is overshadowed by the tale of Thomas Becket, a story that never grabbed my interest because the character of Becket is not developed. It reads like a recitation of facts, not a historical fiction novel.Similarly, the subplot of Hywel, son of Owain Fawr, never pulls me in because Penman tells it through the eyes of her made-up character Ranulf, who is not directly involved in the action.Penman's other books kept me up half the night because I couldn't put them down. This one, by contrast, was a chore to read. I hope the next one will be better."
4,Not Just Eleanor,"I was very much looking forward to reading a novel about Eleanor of Aquitaine, so I was more than a little disappointed that more than half of this novel was devoted to Ranulf, Henry II's Welsh uncle, and the subplots about Welsh political intrigue. Still, it was very well-written and engaging, with sharply defined characters. I did not want it to end so early in Eleanor's marriage to Henry. Oh well - I guess that's what the third book is for."
2,Romantic rather than Historical,"I picked up this book to read about intriguing English history. But I found the matter too sketchy. The thick book talks mainly about relationships using historical developments as a mere backdrop.It did build a few characters including that of King - Henry Fitz Empress - quite impressively, but the rest characters appeared more like fillers.It was sketchy and the episodes not tied well.All in all - not worth the time I put into it!"
5,Excellent,Allof the series that Griffin writes keeps you interested depending if you are reading about police or war of some kind.
5,Timeless Military novel!,Follow the careers of a few brave men through the 50's to today.Good historical fiction with a few plot twists to keep you reading.
5,great author,"I have all of WEB Griffins books and rate him along with Wilbur Smith as my all time favorite author. His sagas span several different action themes, but they are all either military, police or intelligence services. The author has residence both in Texas and Argentina and has spent a great deal of time with our military so he uses his familiarity with these settings and people to cast a very nice spell in his work. My wife also enjoys the books so I would say they are suitable for all readers."
4,From the Back Cover,"It was more than an incident. It was a deadly assault across the 38th parallel. It was the Korean War. In the fear and frenzy of battle, those who had served with heroism before were called again by America to man the trenches and sandbag bunkers. From Pusan to the Yalu, they drove forward with commands too new and tanks too old, brothers in war, bonded together in battle as they had never been in peace."
2,Trys to do too much...,"It seems like the author tried to fit every buzzword into this book. The IDE section was overkill and much of the info is readily available in the Notes help. If you want Java, get a Java book. If you want XML, get an XML book. Get the point?"
1,About as bad as they come,"Don't waste your time or money with this book. I thought for sure with a title like this that it would skip all the what is Notes junk (like how to create views and forms, etc.) that all Notes books seem obligated to include. It is just a bunch of a filler in an otherwise useless book. I was looking forward to seeing some good JavaScript examples as it is used in common Notes situations. Well, no such luck. I struggled to find anything on something as basic and useful as the onChange event. This book is also not organized very well and is very confusing to learn follow. I am not sure the author has a good grasp of what he is writing. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!"
4,"Great for beginners, lacking for advanced.","Since purchasing the book it has served as a great reference. However, I was disappointed that it lacked in showing actual implementation. The section on using JavaScript for form validation is such an example. While we are shown how to use JavaScript to check fields, we are not shown how to appy it in both Domino _and_ the web. Ideally, JavaScript was brought in for such a purpose... thus eliminating having to write 2 sets of form validation for every form. Getting it to work elegantly across both platforms can prove to be tricky, and the books lacks on this side of it. If you are looking for something to point you in the right direction with XML, Java, and Notes, this is for you. If you want 'tricks' of the trade, this isn't so great."
3,Useful,"I have read this book and found it useful. As a beginner on Domino Web Development this book has realy helped me in developing adequate skills in XML, Javascript and Java."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I purchased this book because I thought it might have some useful R5 javascript examples using R5 Objects coding for the jsheader and the like. No such luck, all the examples pertain to coding javascript in html,,,,,you can find that in O'Reilly's JavaScript, The Definitive Guide (which is a MUCH better JavaScript book). The section on XML and Java are all rehashes of other similar books."
5,"duets 2-in-1 #79 ( sexy, single and searching/ Eager, Eligible & Alasken",Love the story line sexy and funny makes me want to move to Alaska and find my own mountain man
3,Short Stack,"This is a Dover Publishing reprint of the 1894 version - it's a concise version, with basically one paragraph per saint. It is organized by the Feast Day of the Saints, and the index at the back has errors (trying to find my patron St Bernadette, the index says page 148, her day is April 16, but, nothing is in the book about her.. Sad.)Save your money and buy the real Butler's LotS, the big 4-volume set version is by far the very best and well worth the money. Presumably even the newer concise Butler's is better than this Dover version (Sorry Dover, love ya but this book is a dud :P)"
3,"Redefining ""self esteem""","A very good tool in helping one to see God's love and his purpose for our lives. The Devotional Guide recommends reading the book, but it can be done alone if desired. Each lesson takes 15-20 minutes and is well-worth the time."
1,Digital CD without artbook????,"This is one of those things that probably happen when the record companies do not provide detail of the purchase. I paid almost 40 USD between tag price and shipping charges to Mexico because I wanted this classic CD from Mecano, as it is a collectors item. None of the available merchants probably knew the difference between CD's with artwork, and lame digital copies without artbook!!!! . The sole purpose of getting a CD, is the artbook, specially when it is collector's item, special limited edition.Without artbook, A digital CD is good for nothing. Record company was very dishonest, releasing a digital CD with a horrible laser printed image (blurry at best), and without artwork. I could have purchased MP3s and rip them to a CD, and paid much less.Jorge."
5,Elite,"Sólo Para Personas INTELIGENTE, con clase y realistas. Eres tu la persona correcta para JUZGARLOS? Personalmente pienso que son los mejores entre los mejores..."
5,COMPARING,"Mecano is a wonderful group I wonder why Laura Branigan also one of my favourites artist made acover of MUJER CONTRA MUJER from Mecano,s album ""Descanso Dominical"", By the way You should buy this compilation there's nothing similar like this double album in the music industry."
2,This is only for the die hard fans!,"If you have never heard Mecano before, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. The new songs are garbage at best. And even as a greatest hits collection, this fails. Buy all of the albums except this one. The best albums to buy for a new listener are ""entre el cielo y suelo"" and ""descanso dominical"". This features 7 new tracks, 1 remake, and 22 of the classics (but they left off several of their all time greatest like ""cuervas de esa chica"" y ""laika"" y "" el cine""). I give it 2 stars because I have so much respect for the work they've done in the past. But this was a really lame production."
1,Una ruca con su taparrabos,"Yo pienso que Ana deberia estar en un asilo en vez de estar demostrando estas piernas que parecen mapas y que si voy aun asilo puedo ver mejores cosas , en cuanto al CD yo opino al igual que el Colombiano que debe ser escuchado preferentemente en Comercial Mexicana y no en una cabaña"
5,Amazing,"Closet Monster is one of the best bands on the scene. Each song is filled with some sort of politcal or social view. Which is fine because nothing they say is something you're going to disagree with. Chances are you know London and Jesse from the band as former bass and guitar players for Avril Lavigne, well please don't hold that against them. This cd is amazing. From the first to the last song. #4 is personally my favourite. They do what not to many recent bands do. Their liner notes are amazing and worth the $25 I spent on the cd alone. They chose to make a funny, and important cd for anyone who is into the punk scene."
2,Too thick bezel,I have owned various sizes of this filter but they all suffer from the flange being too thick. This causes darkened corners on wide angle lenses.
5,Buen libro,"Muy buen libro para aprender excel, lo recomiendo para las personas que recien empiezan con microsoft office."
3,May Warp,"I love this chair and get compliments all the time. It's comfortable and easy to set up but it does get knocked over in the wind. The canopy helps against rain as well! Perhaps due to too much sun during use or long periods of storage, the plastic frame warps over time. This causes it to lose it's spring and makes folding near impossible. With a lot of patience and coaxing, it'll readjust back to normal. I managed to break one trying to get it to reset so I have to buy another."
2,TRUCO,Luego de haber pagado el producto cambian la imagen del mismo pues cuando yo lo escoji no era la imagen con la caja la que estaba si no el producto solo a tamaño exagerado.
4,Fine work by a brilliant soulman,"It was because of this album that I got interested in Stevie Wonder. Babyface gives us his socially consience side and I could not stop listnening to this song. It is one of the best on the album. My other favorites are Every time I close my eyes, Seven Seas, The day(that you gave me a son) Talk to me, and This is for the lover in you. The rythums are fresh and crisp. His familliarily smooth as honey voice will feel like your husband coming home from work, or your father speaking softly to you(whichever you prefer.) Romantic!"
5,Beautiful cd,"this is one of my favorite albums of all time. every song on this album is absolutely beautiful, whether he's singing with Stevie Wonder or by himself all the music wonderful and the words very meaningful."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CDs I HAVE HEARD,While I have never been a great fan of Baby Face when I heard this particular CD I had to have it. I shall be looking for other CDs by this artist. The CD is one of my favorites.
3,pretty good but not his Best,"when the Reunited Shalamar single with Face hit this is for the Lover in you with LL.Cool J Rapping on it I was Hyped.I thought cool Face is Coming back Right.well that was one of the few Highlights.No Doubt He is The Baddest Writer,Arranger,Producer over the past Decade.you name it he has done it.but this album only has a few Bright Spots for Me.Simply Days was a great cut.How Come How Long was Cool Together with the Genius Mind Of Stevie Wonder they Create a Great Message Song.but this Album on a Whole didn't move me like For the Cool In You did.I Believe a Few To Many Guests.but you Know His Best is yet to Still Come."
4,"Good book, plus...","This is a very good book. In addition, I strongly recommend ""Strategic Organizational Change"" by Beitler."
3,Not Very Helpful,"This book is not bad, but there are better books on organizational change. ""Publishers Weekly"" review said the case studies were ""lackluster."" That's putting it kindly; they don't add anything to the book."
5,The Understanding of Pentecost Is Expanded through Brown's Writing,"This book contains five very accessible and useful essays about the Christian feast of Pentecost, written by an important Scripture scholar. Father Brown explores the historical context of the events of the coming of the Holy Spirit to the newly formed Christians, deeply imbedding his ideas in the study of the New Testament books of Acts and John. The reader will gain an expanded understanding of the beginning of the Christian church through Dr. Brown's writings. They always contain thought provoking scholarship, and this volume is another stimulating sampling of his fine mind."
5,The early church in action,"Raymond Brown has a firm understanding of the progress of the early church from being predominatly a sect within Judaism to a universal church. He is able to perceive that the rosy colour presented by the author of Acts, is not necesaarily historically true. In combining Acts with the readings fromn John's Gospel for the Easter season he is able to present the reader with many issues that faced ther early church, especially in those thatg eventually resulted in Christians being forced out of the synagogues."
2,buy all the albums,"while i agree this disc is pretty lame, there are just too many hit's and well known songs to try and do a best of or greatest hit's. to do that you would need a box set and if your gonna do that, you might as well go out and buy all the albums. because as far as i'm concerned, most of the songs off of each and every album would be on there. so go figure. by the way mr. keast, i happen to like ""holy smoke"" & ""bring your daughter to the slaughter"". nuff said."
4,Good,"While an excellent compilation of IM songs, one of their best songs (if not the best), Hallowed Be Thy Name, was left out."
1,Dull old 80's stuff!,"Dated, plodding old 80's ... that really doesn't impress. All of it sounds the same and it's not good. Please, retire, play golf and just keep away from the recording studio. Your time is UP! This band peaked a LONG time ago. Poor and a waste of your time. One saving grace is the cover art by Riggs. Always a source of humour and this is good. Pity it's on such a piece of ...."
2,"""The Greatest Hits""? Not exactly...","I consider Iron Maiden to be the absolute greatest band in metal history, hands down. With that being said, this botched attempt at boiling their career down to a single disc has a number of serious flaws:1. The Paul Dianno era, which includes some of Maiden's best-loved classics, is completely ignored.2. Several of the band's best songs are missing (most notably ""Aces High"" and ""Hallowed Be Thy Name""), while fully half of the Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son album is included.3. The disc includes two of Maiden's worst songs, ""Holy Smoke"" and ""Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter"".With two best-of compilations already out there, Edward The Great is completely unnecessary...with no new or unreleased material there's no reason for established fans to buy it, and for newcomers looking for a quick overview, Best Of The Beast and Ed Hunter are both much better choices. Do yourself a favour...skip this one and just buy all the albums instead!"
3,missing essential Paul Di'Anno material,"The first two albums had Paul Di'Anno on vocals. Their sound was a bit more raw and punky, but the prog-rock/metal elements were still there. There were some great songs from those two: Running Free, Sanctuary, Transylvania (one of my top-5 Iron Maiden songs), Wrathchild, Purgatory. And the sad thing is, none of the Di'Anno tracks are on here. My rating would be higher if they were.Despite the killer tracks from the Dickinson era on here, Iron Maiden can not be accurately represented on a single disc compilation.You'd be better off with buying the studio albums. And start with their first self-titled album or work your way up."
4,"Please understand,","Please understand (a couple reviewers had already) that this is NOT a best of -collection. It isn't meant to be one. The best of -collection was the Best of the Beast! This is a greatest hits -collection and that is a completely different beast. This one has all (or most) the chart hit singles by Iron Maiden, no matter if they are the best Iron Maiden has to offer, or (likely) not.Sure, many like the two first albums, but they didn't have much hit singles back then. And the musical style was also different and it would have made a very incoherent album to put those punk influenced songs on the same cd with 7th son proge-stuff, you see?What this is, is a coherent sounding (i.e. from first to last track sounding like a whole, not a list of distinct tracks) collection of UK chart hits by Iron Maiden. I would have given five stars, but personally I agree that four tracks from 7th son is overkill. Could've put something else instead (Aces High?)."
3,No DiAnno?,"Am I the only one who thought ""Bring Your Daughter..."" was horrible? This has some great songs, to be sure, but would have benefited from an infusion from some of the material from the first two records."
3,Could have been greater.,"I cant believe they did not include at least one of the two best songs they have ever recorded- Rime of the ancient mariner, and Powerslave. Definitely better than a few choices that are on the cd. Could have been Edward the Greatest!"
2,Contractual Obligation,"Because of the exclusion of anything pre-Number Of The Beast, this cd is strictly for the newbies.A better greatest hits would be Best Of The Beast (import version of course), otherwise this is just a waste."
2,Not much,"This is not really that worth it in my opinion. If you have been printing for any amount of time, there isn't much you shouldn't already know in here. The tagging section is very brief. More of a sales pitch than anything else IMO."
2,A By-the-Numbers approach,"This book contains a set of mini cards you can punch out from perforated cardstock sheets which are bound into it. Deals only with the Major Arcana which is less than half of a full Tarot deck. Uses a 4-card spread divided in half with a 5th card in the center. The main body of the book is a list of every possible 2-card combination and what they mean. It might be useful for somebody totally unfamiliar with the Tarot to sit down and do little fortune-telling, but with this approach you don't even really need cards - you could roll dice to generate random numbers and look them up in the book.I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody who wants to learn the symbolism of the Tarot (using a full deck, perhaps) and be able to actually interpret them in a reading."
5,A true Classic!,"Like many, Willy Pogani is my one of my favorite artist ever. This book is a true classic of how to draw the human figure - mostly beautiful classic looking females. When I say classic, by that I mean the classical style of Hollywood cartoons and comics from the 1920s till 1960s. The way Pogani sketches his figures is very easy to learn, again the classical way to do such. If you were a beginner? this book would help you a lot, if not, the least you could do, is to add this book to your collection."
5,One of the best books on the art of drawing ever!,"Willy Pogany is one of the great classic masters of illustration; yet he does not hesitate to patiently take the student from the very beginning steps of drawing to the most advanced figure exercises. With very few words, and many excellent pictures, Pogany reveals the secrets of art and drawing. And even if you never follow the lessons, the pictures alone are worth the price!"
2,page 116,"on page 116 there is a sketch of a woman who has her arms tied behind her back with a rope!! I would be just as angry and upset if it were a sketch of a man. Why did the artist feel this was appropriate? I realize Mr. Pogany died some time ago, but I think the picture should not have been included.Thank you"
3,Good but there are 2 I like better,This is one of my rocks.... For me the standards are I AM THAT and PRIOR TO CONSCIOUSNESS GOOD LUCK!
2,Consciousness and the Absolute,"I bought this book because I was so enthralled with I AM THAT. I AM THAT contains everything that CONCIOUSNESS AND THE ABSOLUTE contains and much more. So save your money, and re-read I AM THAT and if you haven't already read it, then buy it for your library: a TRUE CLASSIC that will change the way in which you view yourself and your life if read with interest and sincerity."
2,Maybe two-and-a-half stars,"Probably the biggest problem with this often charming novel is feeling. The Asian-American teen Mona rebels from her parents, and we see it, are told about it, rather than feeling it. It doesn't particularly make sense, and that stems from Jen not being whole-hearted about the characterization of the parents. This story is a sort of romp for Mona, a notebook purge, perhaps, wherein anything Jen can think of goes in, when the subject is the protagonist and her Jewish boyfriend. The parents are cliches, whipping posts. Occasionally the mother's harangues strike a true note and are thus stirring, but are usually placemarkers. A subplot that occupies a lot of space, concerning an available crash-space for a Black friend of Mona's, doesn't begin to carry the drama Jen seems to attempt. It seems a waste of effort. A lot of the book is like that, including another twisty set of events not to be given away here--not as interesting as the narrative voice would insist--not felt."
2,Mona wants to be something other than Asian in the Promised Land,"For some odd reason this book left a bad taste in my mouth. She was trying so hard to be Jewish, I guess it's not cool or PC for Mona to be Baptist,plus the writers attempt to integrate African -Americans in this book....to be saved by the Chinese girl and her Jewish friends. I felt as if I was having multiculturalism shoved down my throat...Asian-american lit this is not.A wannabe white girl with one black friend literature - buy it."
2,Disappointed!,"Honestly, I looked forward to reading ""Mona in the Promised Land"" - and sad to say, I never finished it.Why? The characters didn't end up meaning anything to me, and the plot seriously ground to a halt about 3/4 of the way through the book. Also, Jen's style reads like a treament for a sitcom.I'm sure her fans will slam me, but it wasn't that funny either"
4,excelent,"Just because you are the most skilled in your field does not mean you have to flash this fact all the time.Case in point, this album by Roy Ayers. Listen to his soundtrack toCoffy, or much of this master's material, and you'll here vibe playing so fast, so melodic, it is a geometric proof the humanly impossible is in fact possible.Ayers goes in a different direction here: a group effort of juicy, silky funk. His playing here is amazing, but there is not as much as you may think. He is more occupied with creating lush textures--smooth synths, amazing female vocals-warm as satin sheets in an elegant heart-shaped bed.Which is even more admirable, more deep in his amazing art. Hear how on ""Lonesome Cowboy,"" he mixes a hick accent with his diametrically opposed urban funk velvet, and makes it work. What craft.Listen hard to this album, and anything else by this tower of musical strength."
2,Not that helpful if you know anything about raising poultry.,"This book is probably only helpful to a person who has never raised any kind of poultry because it is so basic. There is not much information specific to raising turkeys and the last half of the book is about killing & eating them. There are not many pictures in this book, and none of the more unusual breeds like Slate or Royal Palm are shown. The internet is probably a better resource for information on caring for turkeys."
2,very dissapointing,"After reading Story's chicken and duck book, I felt very much let down by their turkey book. Mercia's attempt to cover the subject was too superficial to be of any real value to someone such as myself wanting to get started with turkeys. Like what are the pros and cons of each breed? How about a little about the breeding of turkeys? Which breeds are best noted for temperment? Cullinary appeal? Which are better for the free range or surviving a winter? How many birds per acre? Holderread's duck book put this one to shame and I felt buying it to be a complete waste of my time and finances. I have found much more useful information on the internet from those that have actual experience raising turkeys in their back yards."
2,Worst of the Storey's Guides,"If you want to raise a few dumb broad breasted white turkeys this book will be useful for you. But don't! Instead raise some of the interesting heritage breeds. They are intelligent, fun, and delicious. However, they won't gain weight as fast as the broad breasted white.The best book on raising turkeys is long out of print. It is ""Turkey Management"" by Marsden and Martin. Any edition. To learn more about rare heritage turkeys see Christman's ""Birds of a Feather: Saving Rare Turkeys from Extinction"".Or join the internet Rare Heritage Turkey list."
2,Disappointed,This book only contained the most basic of information. We were expecting it to be more like the guide to raising chickens. I wouldn't waste my money if I were you.
3,Turkey Book Is A Turkey,I was very disappointed in this book. I expected colored pictures to identify the different turkey breeds. The information was too generalized - I found more info available on the internet.
3,The last good one before the break down,"""Savage amusements"" from 1988, is the last good album from Scorpions. After this one it all started to fall down very fast and the band hit rock bottom some years later with the dreadful ""Face the heat"". On ""Savage amusement"", Scorpions continued their commercial direction from ""Love at first sting"" but the material is a lot weaker. Maybe the guys tried too hard to make a similar and equally successful follow up, I don't know...I believe it will take a miracle to get Scorpions back on track again. While waiting for that miracle, we can at least find comfort in past albums from these German rockers!"
2,"good album for Scorpion fans, not for the masses","If you're a big fan of the Scorpions like I am, you'll probably enjoy Savage Amusement. It is not, however, on the same high level as their outstanding peak albums Blackout and Love At First Sting. For the casual listener who wants something beyond a ""greatest hits"" compilation studio album, I recommend those two releases. If you're a Scorpshead who wants more Matthias, Klaus and Rudy, Savage Amusement fits the bill. My favorite tracks include Rhythm of Love and When Passion Rules the Game."
4,Indulge Your Savage Amusement With This Awesome CD!!,"Probabley their last decent effoert of original recording before the group set off into oblvion with disgraaceful music that tarnished their reputation as ledgends of hard rock. All nine of these songs i love and still listen to especally songs like `Passion Rules The Game`,`Media Overkill`,`Rhytem Of Love` are The Scorpions best songs i have heard since 1984`s `LOVE AT FIRST STING` Along with the front cover design which i found very interesting is a well packaged set of good rocking tunes that i never get tired of listeing to. The Scorpions is a rock group that can definatley deliver the goods and maybe one day soon they will do so again."
2,Just a basic guide....,"I was very disappointed after reading this book. After reading several of the other reviews, I thought this book would cover the medium to advanced features of Outlook. Instead, there are chapters devoted to ""receiving email"", ""how to enter in contacts"", etc. This book is way to BASIC to be considered a complete guide."
3,May be too long,"You need to collect 100 candles to ""win"", which for my 4 year old is taking much longer than he would like! Game #6 featured on box is slightly frustrating--the children are too small to count; they never seem to stand still long enough. The other games are fun and have kept his interest."
5,A Keeper Read,"Dianne has another winner here on this her latest release. This is a must read for those wanting a neat storyline and a fun read. Sophie Addison gets a bump on the head and ends up thinking she is Sunny the showgirl , who instead of trying to sell the old saloon as a favor to a friend instead endeavors to keep the saloon going. Now bring Gary McBride, who is running for mayor and making his priority to shut the saloon down into the equation. Sparks and chemistry runs high between the two. Making this a sexy, fun read. I look forward to more books from this author as I have enjoyed all her books to date and feel she only gets better with each release"
5,Extremely funny story. Very Good Book!,"Sophie loses her memory in an accident and thinks she's her friend, Sunny, a Las Vegas showgirl. She tries to save a bar that was left to Sunny, thinking it's hers. Gray is running for Mayor and he wants Sophie/Sunny to sell the bar to the town. It only gets better from here. Dianne Castell is an auto buy for me and this book proves why she should be. I couldn't stop laughing throughout this book at the situations Sophie and Gray got into. I hope Mrs. Castell will write a sequel about Sophie's friend, Sunny. She needs to have her story written."
5,Another Keeper,"Dianne has another winner here on this her latest release. This is a must read for those wanting a neat storyline and a fun read. Sophie Addison gets a bump on the head and ends up thinking she is Sunny the showgirl , who instead of trying to sell the old saloon as a favor to a friend instead endeavors to keep the saloon going. Now bring Gary McBride, who is running for mayor and making his priority to shut the saloon down into the equation. Sparks and chemistry runs high between the two. Making this a sexy, fun read. I look forward to more books from this author as I have enjoyed all her books todate and feel she only gets better with each release."
2,I love the album but...,"What I got and what they said I would get are not the same thing. The product description said ""here's the 1976 album and 1987 remix plus demos, unreleased ""experiments"" and more bonus material!"". This is not true. It comes with the eleven tracks. That's it. I love the eleven, but where are the rest?"
4,"revised is good, but should have been left alone","This album remains among the top five in my catalog (approx 500 rock, prog, jazz and classical albums). I bought the CD because the vinyl was completely worn out. Not knowing that the production had been altered, I was ill-prepared for change. Since then, I still long for raw power of the unaltered version. For that reason alone, I give this version four stars. The original deserves six."
1,Waaay too deep....,"This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste.Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money."
5,Parsons at his greatest,"This album is definitely up there on my top 10 list of greatest albums of all-time. I first discovered the Alan Parsons Project when I noticed that one of their albums was based on Edgar Allan Poe stories. I am a HUGE fan of Poe, so I gave it a try. I didn't have any idea what I was getting into, but it was definitely not a waste of my money. Every track on this CD is good, except for one of the parts on ""House of Usher"".There was one big problem though: the quality wasn't that good. And those narrations by Orson Welles were stupid (don't get me wrong though, I like Orson Welles). So, guess what? I went on eBay and got the MFSL Gold CD version. Trust me, once you listen to the Gold version, you'll realize that the full potential of this album was met.You should definitely give this album a try. If you're a Poe fan, I guarantee you'll like it. If not, borrow it from the library. You might be missing out on something big."
3,Changed for the worse,"I would rate the original version of this album behind ""I Robot"", about even with ""Eve"" and slightly better than ""Pyramid"". The music on side one is powerful and catchy. I especially like the music on ""The Telltale Heart"". The vocals by Arthur Brown (singer of the 1960's hit ""Fire"") are appropriately psychotic, but somewhat lispy making me wonder if the killer was gay as well. Side two with ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" is okay as background music but a little on the boring side.A lot of reviewers have commented on the Orson Welles vocals. I could take them or leave them. What I do object to strongly is the cheesy lead guitar that was added to a couple of tracks. For me, it ruins the songs and I would have preferred that the original was left alone. I am trying to find a good copy of the vinyl version to record so that I won't have to listen to this version again."
3,Calming music for a unquiet soul.,"though i'd hardly call it the best sound for your money, Alan Parsons Project has a quality you can't resist. Tales of Mys. doesn't disappoint. a nice blend of new wave,glam,and progressive rock that at times is almost operatic(see ""cask of amontillado"")while others seem almost like premonitions for industrial rock(see ""the system of doctor tarr and professor fether"")"
4,"Great, BUT.....","OK, it's a masterpiece of prog aural bliss. BUT one thing I cannot forgive. The Prelude on the suite ""Fall of House of Usher"" is literally from an unfinished piece by Claude Debussy, ""La chute de maison Usher"". The fact that this is not acknowledged in the album information (or is it on the Deluxe edition?) is something of a scandal, I believe. Do messrs Parsons/Woolfsons/Powell want us to suppose they could ever write such music on their own? Opinions on this please!"
5,1987 CD is better than the original,"The Alan Parsons Project / Tales of Mystery and Imagination, Edgar Allan Poe (The 1987 CD with added elements): This Progressive Rock gem was made even better when Parsons added Orson Wells voice to it as well as some added synthesizer elements to the original recordings. Alan Parsons wrote ""... I am convinced that `Tales' has become a better album..."". It's not only better, but hugely improved. The 1987 version is the one to own (if you can find it). Five Stars"
4,As good as I remember it!,"My brother bought this album on vinyl when I was a kid and I was fascinated by it. The lyrics and music were haunting and the art on the album cover (a man wrapped in metal strips, like a mummy) was eerie. Listening to this album inspired me to go out and read Poe's collected works. I was thrilled when I found that the music was available digitally. Aside from the nostalgia factor, the music still holds up 30 years later. My favorite has always been the haunting ""Cask of Amontillado"", but now as an adult, I can also appreciate the instrumental suite based on ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" which was on the B side of the album and which I rarely listened to back in the day."
4,music has always been poetry...,"This made me pull out my Edgar Allan Poe book of essays and share with my son (age 16) The music just bridges the poetry perfectly. We ended up talking about how the APP group got started, not as a band but as a ""project"". Just good talking."
4,Listen before you die,"I will not review every song and I will not critique the musical value of these songs, but I will say this..........If you happen to be one of the few who appreciates APP and EAP, you must listen to this. This is better than the Pink Floyd/Wizard of Oz thing. This album has so much feeling that it takes you to another place, if only for awhile. It will make you appreciate EAP, even if you think he is the most drunken Opium obsessed poet/writer in history. It does not ROCK, it will NOT make you GROOVE, it just needs to be something to experience, just to say you did it."
1,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","After listening to the remastered version of an LPthat I just love ever since it was published, I wastruly disappointed. I threw the CD out."
1,Not worth the money,"The Japanese packaging is interesting and the extra tracks are nice to have, however the recording on the original release is distorted. It sounds like it was recorded at too high a level."
1,second rate 70's progressive pop,"Alan Parson's project efforts make clear the reality that a talented producer does not necessarily have the ability to create music of his own that is of any great value or lasting interest. This is a dull, ininspired, unimaginative attempt at progressive-pop. Later efforts prove equally inept. Skip this artist all together and go for the real thing...Simon"
4,They should have left it alone,"I love this album. I'm one of the relative few who bought it when it first came out in 1976. But they really shouldn't have messed with it when they decided to release a remastered version. Yes, I love the Orson Welles narration that they added, but the new guitar parts really annoy me. For anyone who listened endlessly to the original LP, the new guitar parts sound very 80's and stand out in a bad way. I wish people would learn to leave well enough alone. Other than the cheesy guitar parts (and the final, totally boring, song), it's a classic album. It's too bad APP went commercial on their next LP, but it happens to the best of them."
2,"Wow. I love The Wedding Present, but this sucks.",I give it one star for the actual album and one because it's The Wedding Present.Buy every other album they made before this one.
3,The Best of Many,"This disc is one of Gaynor's many best-of collections, but it is noteworthy because it has the rarely-found 8 minute version of ""I Will Survive."" This version work better on dance floors because the extended uptempo body of the song makes the slower intro worth the interruption to the party's rhythm. The disc also includes the great McFadden & Whitehead mid-tempo production ""Let's Mend What's Been Broken."""
5,Great Pictures!,"We purchased this book for my little boy when he turned 3. He loves construction machines and big trucks, so we thought this book might be a good one for him. What a perfect choice! The pictures are real and large enough to see detail on the machines. Our son's vocabulary has even grown thanks to the book's descriptive words. It's a must for all boys and a great birthday present."
3,Okay.,"The pictures are nice, but the way they relate to the names provided isn't always clear. For letter A, there's a pic of a dumptruck (head-on, slightly from above). It's a dumptruck dumping a load. But they call it an ""articulated truck"". You can't tell in any way shape or form from that image that the truck articulates when it turns. So if I try to use this to teach the alphabet, my son will learn D (dumptruck), B, C... I can't even use that picture to explain what ""articulated"" means, that's how far off it is. It's not that great a book. We use it just to look at pictures."
4,awesome pictures but some hokey items,"Overall, a great book because of the pictures. A few alphabet items are cop outs: Keep Out, Yellow Zone. My son noticed the Steamroller is missing from the inside cover, which has outlines of lots of other major construction vehicles. There's also a graphic typo where the Off Road Dump Truck is shown for a different dump truck picture. The pictures though are great and my 2yr son loves flipping through the book."
4,Great book for kids that love Tractors,"My 18 month old son LOVES this book, I just wish it were available with the thick pages instead of paper ones. It has real life photos of working tractors."
1,How to publish a profitable electronic newsletter,"I'm shocked that a company like Amazon[.com] would sell such a nothing product. It consists of 15 PDF pages - only 7 of which have relevant text (much of which are just lists of websites). The other 8 pages are cover, contents, listing of other product, etc. Don't you review these product yourselves. I paid $ Canadian for essentially nothing. I can't believe your selling this piece of junk. I'm the manager of a government agriculture publishing operation and I guarantee we wouldn't even consider selling this thing for $."
3,Poor auto document feeder design.,"This scanner is great when it works. It's compact, fits nicely on desk, provides easy software that allows for quick selection of scan quality, one-sided or duplex scanning, etc.But the auto-document feeder can be exceptionally frustrating. Even if you keep it clean and maintained, it will often refuse to pull just one sheet at a time. Sometimes it starts pulling the next sheet only mid-way through, other times it will pull 5 sheets at a time. The extremely annoying bug requires the user to watch every sheet go through to make sure something is not missed. I've had numerous machines with auto-document feeders, this is by far the worst.If you just scan one document at a time, it's fine.UPDATEIt's many months later and the problem still exists. But it's still too expensive to replace. I've noticed, however, that the problem occurs mostly with documents that have been folded or received in the mail."
4,Fijitsu FI-5110C,"This machine is easy to use. It is used in business. The most attractive feature of the scanner is the twain driver. Very easy to apply what you have scanned directly to your application, rather then having to put it in a folder.I do have to watch the pages go through the chute. It seems depending on the quality of the paper has a effect on if the pages stick together.(better quality, less sticking).Unlike the Fijitsu Scansnap S1500 which I also have, you have to select ""front side"" or ""duplex"" which can be annoying if you only have one page in the grouping that is double sided.I think for the price, its a good machine due to the fact it does have the twain driver and alot of other good features."
2,Long screensaver,"I got this as video wallpaper for a club. It seems out-of-date: it's basically like a late '90s colorful screensaver (this was made in about '93). You could probably make something better by just recording some RealPlayer or Windows Media Player visualizations on a tape. And it's only about 45 mins, so you have to keep rewinding it.It's 2-d animation instead of the state-of-the-art 3-d stuff in other computer animation videos such as the Mind's Eye series. The Mind's Eye type of animation looks cool with techno music, but if you're forced to play any hip-hop music (ick) then this video syncs better with slower music like that."
3,Fine for one or two times,"We used this for a group game at a party and it was fine for that; however, it starts reusing products and prizes pretty quickly which ruins it a little. On the positive side, it was very similar to the game on TV and as a novelty game, it delivered."
1,Lame Game,"Not worth the money, in my opinion. Not only do they start repeating items to bid on, showing the same thing over and over again, but the characters are creepy as all get out. I'm not pleased that I wasted money on this."
2,"Not ""JUST LIKE THE REAL SHOW!""","I'm a huge Price is Right fan and this game was not ""just like the real show"" as they advertise. The game play is slow and choppy. You really have to know what you're supposed to be doing next to keep it moving at all. Also, to know who goes on to the next round, you're supposed to add up the value of your prizes... but they don't always tell you the value of the prizes! Speaking of the prizes it seems like fifty percent of the time the prize is ""A NEW CAR!!"" It is exciting the first few times, but then you start to get them every other turn and it isn't so exciting.Overall, this game is really only fun if you make it so. After the first time few times playing I lost interest. We only bust it out when the right group of people is here to make it exciting."
5,Family Fun,This is a great family game. We have enjoyed playing it and it gives the kids an idea of what some things cost. It encourages competition in a good way because no matter who wins everyone is excited.
1,Just tossed it in the trash,"We played this once in a while when we bought it several years ago. After it as on the shelf in the game closet collecting dust, we pulled it out to play again. Since it's a DVD game and not a video game, there are a lot of limitations to what you can do with it. The 4 rounds, contestants row, pricing games, showcase showdown, and showcase, are not connected in any way, and you need to manually decide who is winning, who belongs in the showcase showdown and showcase. The pricing games are OK. The Shocase Showdown doesn't keep track of who is the winner. You have to determine that yourself. It comes with dry erase boards and markers, but the markers down last very long. If you love the Price is Right and want to play it at home, you're better off with the PC or Wii version."
2,Not near as fun as I hoped,"Hey all! I was really looking forward to play this game when I ordered it. I popped in the game and was ready. I was immediately disappointed. First you can't make your own bid on the prizes before the games so that immediately took all the fun out for me. When I did play a game and lost, it didn't show you the winning price to the prize so it would immediately go back to the beginning. On the showcase showdown, you couldn't make your own bid on it. It gave you four choices that clame close. I don't remember it told you the actual total price of it. Some of the games were kinda fun but I was really disappointed. A total waste of money. Save yourself by not getting this game."
2,What a letdown!...,"I purchased this game with the highest of hopes and expectations. It turned out to be fun for 15 to 30 minutes. Most of the audio just cuts off in many places, the movement is very choppy overall, and about the boards they give you to write down the amount of the prizes that you've won, yeah well, it would be nice if they gave you the amount! They give you nothing of the kind in the pricing games, so what are the boards for?!I could go on, but I won't. This game could have been so much better, I am not thrilled at all."
1,this game is DTS... down to suck,"this game is horrible, if I had a twelve year old son, he could make a better game than this. The gameplay is not smooth, the menus and options are not aesthetically pleasing. Like most of the other reviews on here, I was very excited to play this game and was COMPLETELY disappointed. There are not many prizes and they repeat within the first ten minutes of playing the game, this game might as well be called memory... You couldn't pay me to play this game again."
3,"Great Show, Bad Game.",I bought this game having very high expectations. I am a fan of the Price is Right and was very excited to find out there was a DVD game. I bought it and played with several friends during game night and we were all very disappointed. It was fun for a while but then we started to get repeats of the same item. We ended up playing a different game after an hour because we were getting so many repeats. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. It was fun for a while but there aren't enough items and the repeats get old fast. Just stick to watching the game show if you're a fan.
4,review,It's very similar to the TV version. Only issue is that you sometimes get the same products or showcase and you already how much they cost.
5,GREAT SENSUAL MUSIC,I accidentally run into Chris Spheeris on youtubeand immediately felt in love with his music.I definitely recommend this CD for someone who wants to dive into the atmosphere of intimacy and passion.
5,Wonderful,The best! I read this to my children and they loved it. Because of their fond memories of this book I bought a new copy to read to my grandchildren.
5,Love it!!!,I love this book. I have read it to my daughter at least 20 times already. I cant wait until shes old enough to read it back to me.
3,A lesser known Dr. Seuss book for good reason,"If you receive this book as a gift see if you can trade it in for a better Seuss book. Don't add it to your bedtime reading rotation if you've already stocked some of the more popular Dr. Seuss titles, such as:The Cat in the HatGreen Eggs and HamHorton Hears a WhoThis book is mind-numbingly repetitive and not in a lyrical, pleasing way likeHop on PoporFox in Socks. Add the fact that this concept is much harder to grasp than what you'll find in most Dr. Seuss books. Job satisfaction isn't a problem for young sons.Overall, these issues don't make this book as horrible as a movie tie-in but I can't recommend this book when it fails to measure up to Dr. Seuss classics."
1,Twilight Zone episodes for people with graduate degrees,"I love some of the other things I have read by this justly celebrated Argentine author, but these stories are just awful - a real disappointment. It shows what can happen when a writer settles into a sedate groove, and the questions he explores begin to become less interesting. The mystery and boldness of his other works are not present here. Instead we have descriptions of mundane little things - cats and bourgeois couples for example - that have little in the way of fire or brilliance, and seem instead like pretentious intellectual exercises, second rate Twilight Zone episodes for people with graduate degrees. I know that I am being a little harsh here, but I really did not like it. Check out some other things by Cortazar instead, like ""Blow Up and Other Stories"", for example."
5,What a Wonderful CD,"After having heard k.d. and Tony perform on Letterman, I had to run out and buy this cd. Their voices blend together beautifully and it sounds as if they had been performing together forever. I can't stop listening and the songs are on my mind when I'm not hearing them."
5,A great album to have,"I've been a jazz lover for a while now and when I came across this album, I knew that it'll be a great one to get. Tony and K.Ds voice blend really well together and you can tell that they had fun cutting this album. Tony's ever classic voice coupled with K.d's smooth voice produce an album that I believe is a great showcase of each star's talents without overshadowing one another. My personal fav was the first song. Yes, Tony pays tribute to Mr. Armstrong and his attempt at doing ""A Wonderful World"" is a great effort but way short of the original. Then again, I don't think any artist can do it the way that Louis did.If you're looking for a great vocals album, pick this one up. Even if you decide you don't really fancy it, it makes great background music at parties."
2,Disappointing,"I have listened to Tony Bennett for over 50 years and have generally found him to be a great interpreter of this kind of music. This album left me very cold. No Nelson Riddle orchestration here, and Bennett seems to be going through the motions, despite the endearing photo on the cover. Not bad, but little that is moving in music that should be."
4,Lang tops Bennett,"ok....yes, Tony Bennett is a legend, but this performance demonstrates that he has become a song stylist and should consider retirement as the great voice is a bit too rough around the edges. BUT, KD Lang has never been better. That woman can sing! and, she just owns these great songs.This CD is certainly worth buying for KD alone. And, it is evident that these two talented singers have a great admiration for each other, Louis Armstrong, and this wonderful material. I just keep wishing that KD had recorded this as a solo venture."
2,"Tony, it's over....","Listening to Bennett on this CD is like listening to post-1965 Sinatra. They're both just faking it, but, due to their iconic status, they get away with it. On this CD, Lang just plain carries Tony, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.Take a pass on this one and the 'Duets' album; age has caught up with Bennett. Instead, give a listen to 'Fifty Years: The Artistry of Tony Bennett'. Hearing his early material will make the deterioration in Bennett's voice quite obvious and make you wonder if it's really the same vocalist.Time marches on and it's cruel what it has done to Bennett's range, but, thankfully, the great work of his early and middle years is still around...."
3,"5 stars for KD, 4 for Tony and 2 for Producer!","The first debut cd by two of the world's most acclaimed and gifted singers, KD LANG AND TONY BENNETT, could have been much better! KD can belt it out or lower the register into a seductive whisper...she is in perfect voice as usual on this album! Tony, while not as strong a male vocalist and many others, sounds just fine in his soft style....however, every song in the album is slow. I saw these two on tour together last year and they really excel together with the fast paced rockers!!! I wish T Bone Burnett had shown more of their fun side also....better luck next time! Louis Armstrong would be proud of KD and Tony!"
3,An Odd Couple,"This is a case of an album being less than the sum of its parts. I'm a huge fan of kd Lang, and I've got a couple of Tony Bennett's CD's too. T-Bone Burnett's production and the arrangements are top notch, so the recording sounds lush and beautiful. But for me, the singers don't click. It sounds like kd is holding back something, maybe trying not to upstage Tony, and Tony's voice is obviously past its prime. Old Sachmo had a croaky voice too, but it was his trademark, not the effect of old age."
2,I wish I liked this album,I like both of their voices. I like most of the songs. I did not like the arrangements - no pep at all. Just so flat. I was very sad that this did not work out better. I was so looking forward to it. But it is like something on a mellow jazz station. No life to it.
5,Pure Heaven,"If ever I should find myself stranded on a deserted island with only on CD to listen to, THIS would be that CD."
5,A wonderful blend of voices . . .,"I had recently purchased a cd of solos by kd lang and really enjoyed it. When looking for more music by her I came across this cd on which she sings with Tony Bennett. I listened to the samples and decided this was a great blend of two individually very talented people, so I bought it. I have listened to it many times and have yet to tire of it. Great price and reasonable shippping, too!"
3,not as good as expected,I ordered this CD thinking it would be as good as the 49th Parallel Cd of hers-it is not-I was disappointed-did not care for Tony Bennett that much-
5,A Wonderful Pairing,"Pairing k.d. Lang and Tony Bennett was a stroke of musical genius. The magical synergy between them, the combination of two such diametrically opposite vocalists, the obvious chemistry between them is wonderful to behold. Tony has never been better, and k.d. displays the full range of her vocal talents effortlessly and perfectly in sync with Tony's flawless pop/jazz style. It is a masterful collaboration on every track, but ""Exactly Like You"" and ""What A Wonderful World"" are exceptionally good. This is an essential purchase if you collect either artist. It has all the makings of a great classic album from two of the greatest vocalists around today. Bennett proves conclusively with this gem that great vocal artistry is possible at any age and at any stage of one's career. I only hope there's 'A Wonderful World Part Two."""
3,A so-so effort,"I bought this CD with no preconceived notions of how it would be. I am a long time kd fan so I figured that this was a must for my collection. I listened to the entire cd and found it palatable, but lacking. There are some lovely songs on here and kd sounds wonderful, but then there are other songs were their voices aren't really meshing and they come out sounding like they are trying way too hard. I couldn't help but think that this would make the perfect album for a wedding reception. I think kd is at her finest on her own."
2,2 Great Singers. 12 Great Songs. 1 Ho-hum Album.,"I don't get the politics of Tony Bennett saying ""yes, dear"" to KD Lang at the end of the 1st number, but sad to say, the whole album seems an overproduced mistake, including sappy saxophone interludes and treacly high-pitched violin countermelodies.I love sax. I mean, I love saxophones and saxophone players as if they were part of my family. But someone has got to stop this easy listenin' moony-waily lushly lackadaisical sinuous syrupy ""smooth jazz"" exploitation of just one tiny, embarrassing aspect of the saxophone's otherwise terrific character.But I doubt the small-minded no-talents who produced this album would ever get the drift.Note to Word Lovers: ""Treacle"" originally meant ""a medicinal compound formerly in wide use as a remedy against poison."" However, Tony and KD got suckered into singing on an album that's practically poisonous itself."
2,"Decent eye protection, crappy arms","Just broke another flimsy arm on the sunglasses for the second time in a year and a half. I'm pretty careful with my stuff. If they didn't break so easily (thin and brittle), I would be happy with them. Because of their fragile nature, the $20 or so pricepoint is too high. They are probably worth more like $5."
1,coating peeling off smoke colored frames,Really disappointed in the quality of my second pair of Solarshields fits over sunglasses. Let me say that the first pair I had lasted over 2 years. Unfortunatly I lost them. I tried really hard to find the exact same pair with no luck. I purchased the smoke colored pair and I could not be more disappointed. The coating they put on the glasses started peeling off after had them for 2 weeks. I have now had them for 6 weeks and they look terrible. They are also too flexible and cheaply made. The lenses are the only thing I like about them..
1,ARMS BREAK OFF,If the temple arms didn't break off because of cheap brittle material this product would be rated very good. For this kind of money I would look elsewhere.
1,Broken Bow,"I have worn Solar Shields since my eye surgery 7 years ago. The first ones I had were just fine and lasted many years. I replaced them and the bows lasted less than a year before one broke. I guess I am a slow learner as I have 4 pair, all with different shaped bows or the same bow broken so I can't even make one of 2. The last ones lasted 4 months."
5,"Solar Shieild Fits over your RX glasses, sunglasses",This product met or exceeded my expectations and continues to do that. i will re-order more of these as-needed. i have issues with cataracts and the design of these glasses helps me to see more clearly. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJQPVA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
5,Great for over glasses,My husband had a pair (about 6 years old) and they finally broke - I bought these to replace the old pair and these are much better material. Good size - not too big.
2,Brittle arms break easily,"I have bought two pairs of Solar Shield ""Fit Over"" glasses. The first pair broke rather easily after just a few weeks - one arm (or ""temple"" in eyeglasses terminology) snapped midway between the frame and the ear portion of the arm. Thinking it was a fluke, I bought a second pair of Solar Shields. This time an arm snapped while just holding them in two hands and raising them to my face. Since that pair was ruined too, I carefully applied light pressure to the other arm and it snapped at the same point - midway to the ear. This is indicative of very poor quality materials / workmanship. Too bad they break so easily, as they fit well and I had high hopes for them. At $19.99, they about 10 times as expensive as they should be. I am trying another brand now."
5,Excellent and inexpensive sunglasses,"Sunglasses fit over my large bifocals perfectly. The tinting is perfect. The glasses are very light, and they look good too."
2,Breaks Easily,"I have had about eight pairs of Solar Shields and they all have broken--most at the left ear piece. The plastic is brittle and cheap, even by current standards for eyeglasses frames, which in general are incredibly over-priced and flimsy, and a major consumer rip-off.In my opinion they are engineered to fail. I picked up a pair of Solar Shields at a Fred's store that were discounted down to $2.99, which is about the price they should sell for, given their cheap quality and lack of durability. They were made to end up in the landfill, along with mountains of other throw-away products (junk) produced in China for international corporations who take pride in how efficiently they can rip off millions of customers, over and over again."
2,"""Temple"" arm flimsy & breaks easily","The sunglasses are comfortable and function well but break easily. I bought one pair that lasted about a year before the temple arm snapped. I thought that specific pair might have been defective, so I tried another. I was very careful in handling not to stretch or strain the temple, but after about six months this one snapped as well. Otherwise a good product, but I won't buy another.The manufacturer should be reading the multiple reviews & comments noting flimsy temples. I suspect it would only add a dollar or two to the price to incorporate metal reinforced temples."
3,"ok, but not as good","I bought this to replace an older pair that was lost. The earpieces are made of a brittle looking plastic, different than the old pair which was made of tougher stuff. The earpieces do not fit tightly on my head like to old pair did. They've fiddled around with them to cut costs I suppose. Otherwise the sunglasses are ok. They fit over my glasses easily which is what makes them useful for me. they are not at all cool of course, my daughter doesn't like be around me when I'm wearing them. she thinks they look dorky and they do but they work and they are convenient, low cost and provide good UV protection."
1,Cheap Chinese Product with high price.,My wife and I both have bought the Solarshield twice and both of ours broke in the same area from cheap plastic. At 20 bucks a pop they are too expensive to continue. Will look for American made.
3,Fun Learning Activities,"Ok, we know that software from the year 2000 is outdated. But this is a fun set of games to teach numbers, letters and much more. Of course, the use of learning software for 3 year-olds requires adult labor. The child, if given the chance, will probably mess with the keyboard in ways you don't want. Yet, under the right conditions, this ""toy"" provides enhanced learning. It's interactivity and graphics absorb the child. Such software can be very useful under proper adult guidance. Finally, this worked well for the child I got it for, but only with 100% concentration of myself or the child's parents. Therefore, this is a labor-intensive yet quality ""toy."""
2,Outdated - Check it will work with your computer,"My wife bought this game because she thought it was the same game they used at my daughter's pre-school. Unfortunatly, the game does not work well at all on a Windows 7 machine."
2,Disappointed,"These bike gear cable sets are low end equipment. I guess you get what you pay for. First, the cable housings are large diameter - the same size as brake cable housings. Second, they don't have an internal nylon lining - they are just bare metal inside. Third, the cables are a sloppy fit in the housing and you can't adjust them precisely - they are not compressionless and won't work very well with modern index shifting systems. They are acceptable for older gear shifting systems that aren't indexed. Amazon should have provided a more comprehensive description on the product being sold. I'd return them but it's not worth the trouble. I'd give them one star, but I am going to try using them temporarily."
5,OOOOOPS,"I did a search for a very specific title AND edition (7th) and then hit purchase even though an image of the item was not available (I knew I needed a ""purple"" book). Boy was I surprised to get a different edition of the book (6th) with a yellow cover. So, after having paid for overnight delivery because I was already two weeks late in getting a book I needed for school, here I was with a book I couldn't use and now I was looking at being three weeks late and behind in my schoolwork! Long story short, I gave them another chance and this time I got the right book and Amazon gave me 100% credit for the 1st book, including the return shipping. Way to go!"
4,Helping Hand,"Reading this just helps me enjoy my golf game a little better :-) Makes my game fun again, because I am not in control."
3,maximus gunther the 1st,"This book is a good book.I recommend it to kids of all ages.this is a entertaining mistery book.This book was about students in Bailey elementary.Mr.Bogey who is the substitute for the class because their real teacher Ms.Jeepers(which the kids in her class think she's a vampire)is sick.When the kids see Mr.Bogey in the locker room they thimk he's the Bogeyman.When Eddie one of the main characters of the story tells all his friends he thinks Mr.Bogey is the Bogeyman they try to tell him that he isn't.This is a entertaining book because it is short,it's funny,and it has some verygood pictures."
2,Criminally Overpriced,"The swabs work as advertised, but at $3.50 a pop, they are highway robbery. Make sure to consult your camera manual before cleaning your sensor. There is a screen/filter in front of the sensor and you need to tell the camera you want to clean the sensor to get the screen/filter to retract out of the way."
1,Highway robbery,"The only reason to buy these swabs is to keep the sticks and rewrap them with pecpads. You can also cut down a rubber spatular found at your cooking store and wrap it with the pec-pads. try that, it works very very well. kodak actually suggests using pec-pads on their sensors...well, they used to anyway before they quit makeing slrs."
5,Abraham's Best DVD to Date!,"I've bought all the Abraham DVds..this one is by far the best one. I've been following Esther and Abraham for over 13 years, their material evolves over time, and this DVD is the composit of their new terminology: The Vortex, where everything we want is. The Abraham material is the clearest information available on the planet today. In this DVD, it makes you aware of how to get into the Vortex, and how most of the planet is outside of the Vortex, arguing over she said, he said, democrats vs republicans, etc. This DVD will bring you closer to the things you've been asking for, simply by getting into the Vortex, a vibrational reality that preceeds physical reality. There is no other information available that comes close to the clarity this offers. I highly recommened this DVD.Anyone on a self-discovery-awareness journey will benifit from this astounding material. Simply the best!"
5,Love Abraham!,"I really enjoy these DVD's. I think they answer questions in very matter of fact ways, often with a little playful sarcasm. I get so much out of this and could watch it many times."
4,THRILLING PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPER THAT SPREADS ITSELF THIN,"The script pecks in every conceivable direction, and a few inconceivable ones, but surely not as terribly as the reviews would suggest. It held my attention throughout its winded course.The suspense scenes are fabulously constructed, revolving around universally appealing themes -- bank heist, kidnapping, layered romance, betrayal, and above all, some fabulous twists.Part of the slick fun is trying to figure out what the characters have up their individual sleeves, what surprising turn each may have to dish out. Result, an alluring semi-noir in which the audience is not privy in advance to how they'll all get away with it, or even who the good or the bad guys are.Towards the end, we fall into the net of one gratuitous turn too many, which the eventually simplistic plot clearly did not have an appetite to digest, but hey, overall it is pretty cleverly done. Renting, at least, may be a good deed indeed."
2,"HAS GOOD ACTORS IN IT, BUT...","DURING A MISSING PERSONS INVESTIGATION, A COP [SAMUEL L. JACKSON] GETS KIDNAPPED BY A GANG OF THIEVES. MEANWHILE, AN ELABORATE BANK ROBBERY IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN. OF COURSE, SAMUEL DOES GREAT AS ALWAYS, BUT THE SCRIPT AND ESPECIALLY THE VERY SLOW PACE BRINGS IT DOWN. WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD MOVIE TURNED OUT TO BE A DISSAPOINTMENT. FAR FROM BEING THE WORST MOVIE YOU CAN RENT, BUT, IT'S JUST NOT AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS. MAYBE NEXT TIME, THEY WON'T TAKE ALL DAY TO GET STARTED."
3,Interesting and Boring Movie,"The only reason I wanted to see this movie is because of the ""swirl"" relationship between the characters of actors Samuel L. Jackson and Milla Jovovich. His character helped an old couple only that he was held captive by some guys they knew. Her character had a criminal boyfriend and so. But, I really loved the interracial connection the most."
4,A good addition,This isn't one of the best DVD's I have but it does make a good addition to my collection. I fine one to watch just before you want to fall asleep. It doesn't get you too excited or upset. The ending isn't a big surprise but a decent one to watch.
2,Name of the song,"Movie was ok, like both Samuel L Jackson and Milla but was disappointed. But does anyone remember the name of the song that Milla and Samuel play together - her on the piano and him on the cello - she asks him if he has ever played it and hands him the sheet music. thanks"
5,Awesome software,My son is 3 yrs old and absolutely loves it. Once he played on it so long that he fell asleep on the computer. Great games and fun activites.
4,GREAT BUT NOT ENOUGH,"This is a great program for my 4 year old. We homeschool and we needed a preschool program. I refunded on Jumpstart Preschool because it contained magical things that I don't allow into my household.This Jumpstart Pre-K was not available at any of our local stores. The only complaint I have is.... the rewards are stickers in the park(it will make sense when you see it)anyway, my 4 year old got so many that the game said the park was full and we would have to start a new game to get more. The only way I could think to do this was to put in a nickname. We decided not to do this because he would lose all previous scores and stickers. So, he works without rewards and still he loves it. I say buy this and explain the problem when they come to you and say..."" My park is full of stickers"". I bought this at AMAZON."
5,What If,"Feeling down? No problem, just pop this movie in your DVD player and in no time you will be laughing and rolling on the floor. Watch it anytime, by yourself or with that special someone. You will have a wonderful time........"
1,Terrible Book and Sorry Wasted the Money,"I am so sorry that I got this book. I bought another book, Cathy's Howse book and this book and I regret this purchase. It is almost as if I could write this book myself and did a google search and cut and paste. I didn't necessarily take away any knowledge from her book. By the way, I also think that she is biracial so her hair needs aren't mine. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,Healthy black hair: step by step instructions,"Even though there is alot in this book that is helpful and informative on hair care,a lot of what this book offered on hair care I did not neccessarily agree with. you can get some good tips from this book but I believe when you read some of the things the author recommends you will be saying I am not doing that because that sounds crazy. If you know anything on black hair care you will not follow a lot of the things in this book."
3,BEWARE!,"Be forewarned, THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS OF THESE SONGS. This album was recorded by Johnny in a studio with a band in the late 80's. It's not a bad record, but if you're like me and wanted the original songs, you will be sorely disappointed."
4,A Johnny Cash Update,"Johnny is among my favorite musicians. With his voice and careful delivery of lyrics with a heavily played guitar, I can listen to just about anything he'll sing.Now, to be noted, some of these songs are remakes. That's not a curse, until you are an originals purist. You know that. Give a listen to a few samples and see how they pan out. They work for me. I hope you'll like them too.This isn't the last word on Johnny. It is a good CD to play in your truck on the way to town, or to [turn] up in the rec room while playing a bit of pool. ""Boy Named Sue"" and other aren't on this one. None of his gospel stuff either, but those can be found on other albums.I fully recommend ""Classic Cash"" by Johnny Cash. Buy it, listen to it, enjoy it, and remember, don't bring your guns to town.Anthony Trendl"
3,Not The Best Effort,"One day I wanted to get a greatest hits collection of this guy called Johnny Cash. I bought this CD. Thank god I knew there had to be something better out there. Some good stuff here, but there are better versions of these classic songs. Go find them."
5,I completely agree with some of the other reviewers! Brilliant album!,"This was the first Johnny Cash CD I listened to and to be honest with you, I'm gonna admit I was quite disappointed. Then later a friend bought me Cash's original recordings and loved him immediately! I then began buying more Johnny Cash CD's and again listened to this one! I now own every single one of his albums and have them on my computer and CD's. I have his vinyl which weren't issued on CD all on my PC! I must say now that it has completely grown on me and I love it!!! I love remakes of my favorite artists's songs! I know some others don't which is a shame, but I do very much. Highly recommended!"
1,No point in this album,"I commend the idea of re-recording some of these hits. I could see that maybe they would have new meanings in his later years. But every track is over-produced and devoid of life. In fact, it's quite painful to listen to, and it makes you really appreciate Rick Rubin. If you've ever wondered what ""phoning it in"" means, this is a great example. This album is so bad I gave it away."
2,Why re-make a song when the original is so good?,"I generally do not like re-makes, especially by the same artist and particularly when nothing new is brought to the song. If one is going to re-make a song, at least attempt a different arrangement with different instruments, tempo, etc. Don't make it identical to the first recording; this is tantamount to trying to remind people you are still alive, which is rather sad. This CD reveals how desperate Cash was to revive a once hot career, and the results are unmemorable to say the least. If you are a casual Cash fan, steer clear of this one. I would recommend it for completists only."
2,Nothing more original THAN the original recordings...,"These re-recordings of ""classic"" Cash tunes show WHY the 1950s and early '60s originals will always be the versions that will forever be remembered by serious music fans in future decades. In the original Sun and Columbia versions there was a special something that just made you want to really listen...For CLASSIC CASH there is no substitute for the recordings Johnny Cash made with the REAL Tennessee Two/Three: Marshall Grant on bass, the legendary Luther Perkins on guitar, and later WS Holland on drums. The band included on this album (although WS Holland and longtime guitarist Bob Wootton are present) sounds more like some ""cover band"" Cash may have picked up on the way to the recording studio. Cash re-recorded some of the songs on this album in 1963 and '64 for the I WALK THE LINE LP on Columbia with much better results! Hardly worth listening to more than once."
3,"Good, but production values limit","I love synthpop and, don't get me wrong, this release certainly delivers. But it is two steps shy of ""great"" because the production values (mixing) are sub-par. Dunno who produced this puppy, but the mix is muddy. All the synthpop cliches that we love are here (yet a number of tracks borrow too much from VNV nation), and the voice of the singer is lovely, but the whole album sounds like it was recorded through a telephone at times. I see big things for the group in the future, and this album is promising, but as is, its amatuerish."
3,Sigh...I'm bored!,"Droom has SUCH promise! I'm intoxicated by the first few tracks...but then...wait...has the track even changed to the next? I got bored the first time I listened to 128 1/2 Days, because it all sounds the same! And I've listened to it several more times, thinking maybe I'm just not used to the band yet to pick up the various colors of each song, but still the same reaction. Different lyrics...somewhat, but that is about it! I recommend skipping this album. Droom has a beautiful sound but there isn't enough variety between songs. I cannot say anything about the other albums...they could very well be better."
5,Great friend for the traveler,"This, along with the Grundig YB-400 are the best shortwave radios offered on Amazon at the moment. Both have their advantages and it is up to the user to decide which are more important. The advantage of the Sony is its synch. detector which helps you get rid of interference from adjacent stations. This can be very helpful when trying to listen to a station on the crowded bands at peak times. The Grundig doesn't have this feature but does have much better audio which makes listening more pleasant over the long haul. Both are great buys and will make great companions on those overseas trips. If you travel to Europe or eastern North America go with the Sony due the high number of strong stations, otherwise go for the Grundig and enjoy the best audio of any portable on the market."
4,"kansas city, mo",I believe this receiver to be the best one for the price. I have had two of these and will probably either buy another or get a replacement antenna for the one I currently own. The only drawback is that this receiver does not remember modes--such as sideband selection. I also collect some sw receivers but like the 7600G the best in this price radio.
4,Really good band,"I've actually had the pleasure of seeing them quite a few times while visiting Phoenix. We would actually hunt them down to hear them play. If you love a little punk and a little rock then this is your CD. Chester Bennington of Linkin Park was at one time lead singer for Grey Daze. It's along the lines of STP, so don't expect the rap/rock thing. Awesome drums, guitar and base make up a good combination. I actually have a signed photo of the band. I hate they didn't get the recognition that was deserved to them when Chester was with them. I think you'd enjoy it. My personal fave is B12!"
3,Grey Daze is okay...,"I got Grey Daze's album for $10 on iTunes (and the release date on there is December 06, 2000). Some of the album's songs are a bit too slow and/or boring. Of course, Chester's voice is great. Grey Daze's version of ""Anything, Anything"" is better than the original by Dramarama. The best songs on there is ""B12"", ""Drag"", and ""Anything, Anything""."
4,Linkin Park is Great BUT!,"These guys are truly great artists, but if you play an instrument you realize that they really aren't that great. Almost all their songs are digital and computarized, the only instrument is the drums. But THEY ARE the best ""digitalizers"" I have ever heard. They are definitely what I call quality ""music computer makers!"" This a great CD to listen too (Hybrid Theory etc), GREAT LYRICS TOO. BUT NO INSTRUMENTS except drums and their voices. That is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. But I really hope they keep pumpin out the CDs!"
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"I know that this is not Linkin Park and I did not expect it to sound like Linkin Park, but I expected a little more from Chester Bennington. I bought the CD expecting some great songs written by Chester Bennington, boy was I wrong. Now I know why Chester left the band. Not because of differences, it was probably because he couldn't stay awake. This has to be the most boring CD I have ever heard in my life. If you listen to it more than once you risk going into a coma. B12 is the only song that remotely has an upbeat tempo. The rest of the songs on the CD all sound the exact same and have absolutely zero energy. I recommend not wasting your money on this CD unless you need a good sleeping pill!"
4,grey saze rocks,"chester, mace, and shawn are still friends but bobby died because of a brain tumor not to long ago. chester was supposed to get together with them 2 years ago for a benifit concert for bob in phoenix, AZ, were Grey Daze is from, but couldnt because of the recording time period for Meteora. shawn said on a fan chat that he would gladly fill in for LP's Rob Bourdon if anything would happen to him just to play with chester again.He also said ""No Sun Today"" is going to be re-released on atremis records in the near future. no word yet though..."
5,GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,im over 13 but what the hell anyway this cd is great Chesters voice is TRULY amazing in some of the songs his voice sounds so haunting its also cool how in Linkin PArk he screams so hard youd think he was dying some horribel death but in gray daze he he shows off how well he can sing with out going to screaming but hes a talented guy and all his songs are great but i wouldn't pay 500$ for it try and find it cheaper cause that is plain stupid anyway peace out
2,"Love it, Love it, Love it!","At first I hated this perfume! I bought it in the winter and it had no scent life whatsoever! It is now summer and I have tried this again and have just fallen in love with it. It is sweet like a dessert. I put it in the catagory of Pink Sugar and Pleasures Delight. I cant change my star rating but I can change my review, which I have done so. I recommend this for summer all the way. I do not however recommend this in the winter because It is way to light and airy for the heavy molicules of winter, it has no saying power for that. Winter scents that I do recommend are Angel by Thierry Mugler-Man that last FOREVER! Hypnose for the summer!"
3,Too Close to Tresor,"Not quite as powerful or sweet as Tresor, but it smells a lot like it to me just the same."
1,perfume spray,Save your money. The shipping is as much as the tiny spray bottle. Even though you get 2 it is still a royal ripoff!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not happy with stopper,I was not happy with the stopper. Once it was opened I had trouble getting it to stay closed without leaking. I love the perfume but was hoping for a spray dispenser.
5,hypnose,I was very happy with the communication with the seller. They were very considerate and helpful. Received the product fast. Happy with the product. Recommend this seller as excellent. Good experiencethank you
5,Just what I ordered,"This is exactly what i thought it was going to be. It plugs in and charges my mp3 player, so i'm quite happy. No complaints."
4,Solid Office MB,These motherboards are great for general office machines that are not required to do any hard 3D work. If you are in the market for a MB for general office or home use this is very solid and stable. If you intend to be playing games or doing any 3D animation or drawings you will want to lean towards a MB that isn't equipped with onboard video because it won't do it for you.
3,Focused Reader Market Too Traditional,"When it comes to study tips it is very helpful to some degree. However, it is obviously focused solely on the young student. With a higher rate of midlife changes and mature students coming in, it seems to ignore the lifestyles and demands that they have to contend with while studying, such as family obligations or financial responsibilities beyond themselves or even management of time between studying and family. I would not recommend it for a mature student."
5,A Tremendous Novel of Great Importance!,"Jimmy Santiago Baca's ""Working in the Dark"" is a novel of extreme importance. Baca gives life and voice to imprisoned people who because of their ethicity, language, culture, and imprisonment have ben reducaed to cultural and social marginality by the dominant white culture and by those foriegn to Southwestern culture. ""Voices From the Dark"" is a must read for students of Chicano culture and the Southwest. It is a modern classic which may not be realized as such for decades to come!"
1,Very disappointing,"Almost half the book is filled with appendices relating to information that most enthusiasts would already know. To top it off, the rest of the book, being the main narrative, does not furnish much new information and this just adds to the ordeal."
1,What a Horrible Book,Short and sweet: This book is a big disappointment; don't waste your money. You have been forewarned.
3,Trubute to Manstein,"Depending on what the reader is expecting, the format is a general description of Operation Barbarossa, and Army Group South Operations on a Strategic Level. Much of the book is a hodgepodge of basic information , the emphasis is on the German General Manstein with only 2 pages dedicated to a brief description of the actual heavy fighting that took place around Sevastopol. Interesting appendice with background info on Heavy German Siege Guns however."
1,An extremely disappointing book,"The Crimean Campaign culminating in the siege of Sevastopol, is a fascinating one but you are not going to learn much about it from this book. This is a superficial and inadequately reseached book. Much of the very few pages of text is either general or largely irrelevant. The appendicies are mostly worthless. This book is a waste of time and money."
5,Excellent Presentation on use of the Luftwaffe in battle,"This is one of the best books I've seen on the last major German Victory of World War II. It presents both sides fairly and does an EXCELLENT job on covering the important use of the Luftwaffe in winning the battle. I really appreciated the way the author put the battle in the context of the bigger social and military picture. While the military role-playing ""gamer"" that wrote the negative review may not find this book to his liking, most history and military buffs would be thrilled to find it under the Christmas tree!! Glenn Sweeting is known for his meticulous research and the illustrations and appendices are worth the price of the book alone."
4,Beautiful Stories,"This is a beautiful book of short stories from Mitsukazu Mihara. If you liked the more sad and twisted stories from her Doll series, you will love these. The stories are about so many different people in so many different situations: A snow girl, a vampire, two homosexuals, a stalker, a bullied young teen, and a plastic surgery patient. The book features six stories. My favorite are the last two (about the surgery patient and the vampire) and the first one (about the snow girl) because they are haunting and beautifully written. Very poetic and, as always, wonderfully drawn. The other three were on the higher end of mediocrity, but they were still mediocre and although they made a good read, they didn't jump out at me. The worse one was probably the bullied teenage boy story. Not very interesting at all. Really, this book deserves 4.5 stars. Too bad I don't round up!Highly recommend it if you enjoyed the 1st and 3rd volumes of Doll. Can't get enough of those Loli-goth characters!"
3,not as good....,"this manga is pretty good, expecially the adam and eve story.but it's nowhere near as interesting as doll or as sadly thought provoking as the embalmer.it's a so-so collection only for big fans...the artwork isn't lacking, but the story isn't very good."
5,The Kids Get it!,"We absolutely LOVE this book. After checking it out from our library multiple times, we finally bought ourselves a copy. When I first read it I had a 5, 3 and 2 year old boys. They 'got' the message. My kids love to ask if a food is a green light or a red light food. It breaks our diet down into terms that they can understand and has given them insentive to eat the kinds of food that will make them big, strong, fast and smart! It also mentions 'training the tastebuds' which my boys really took to. Whenever I would serve a new vegetable or dish, we would all discuss the importance of training their tastebuds to like foods that were good for them. We are all excited to have a permenant copy in our home now!"
2,A little too technical,"This is full of nutritional information, in a bright positive format, but I found it too extreme for our lifestyle. I wouldn't argue with the information, but my children are not going to give up all fatty foods or salty foods or sweet foods. I just want to encourage the eating of what I call ""Pretty foods"" like vegetables and fruits. This book went a bit further than I'm willing to."
2,Not near as good as the hype,"I was looking for books with the Coast Guard in them, since my son is applying for the CG Academy. I got this one and Coming Back Alive, which both cover the same rescue and people. Compared to Coming Back Alive, this book is a loser. It was filled with so many F words, I ended up getting sick of it and pitching it."
3,Takes a while to get off the ground,"Like a football game that doesn't get going until the fourth quarter, this story of five fishermen swamped in a massive gale off the coast of Alaska nearly buckles under the weight of its words until the last act. The emotional center of the story is washed out by the flood of details - it's not necessary to know what each pilot had for breakfast, the length of everyone's hair or the depth of water along nearly the entire Alaskan coastline. It's like the writer is used to being paid by the word and can't sift through the details for the story. The description of the helicopter rescue, however, is gripping and goes a long way towards redeeming the book. Lewan isn't Sebastian Junger, but he makes a respectable attempt."
1,Bad attempt at a good story,"The writer should take a few lessons from Krakauer, Into Thin Air, or Junger, The Perfect Storm. His desire to use the ""F"" word at every opportunity displays his lack of trust in telling a really thrilling story without using gutter speech."
5,Fascinating human drama within a real life adventure tale,"What sets this book apart from other non-fiction adventure is Lewan's empathetic and yet unflinching portrayal of the fishermen, their rescuers and the decisions and circumstances that brought them all together one horrible night in the frigid waters off the Alaskan coast. His masterful writing allows us to see the human in the hero without diminishing his heroism.While other reviewers have found fault with the fine level of detail and the intense focus on the histories of the men involved, I found it created a more personal understanding of the story and the men in it. You can feel the wind, the water, the adreneline, the gut-wrenching fear and determination, but even better you feel a deep connection to the human beings struggling in and above the towering waves."
4,Review from Soil Science,"""This well written, slim, Volume 6 in the Soil & Environment sweries presents a valuable introduction to the topic of in situ soil remediation...I would be glad to use this book fo the introductory course on remediation ofered to our professionals in the environmental field.""-by Peter F. Strom"
5,Revealing Jesus in the language of this generation,"This is an excellent book. Gee & Teter really speak to the hip-hop generation, not from above, but from within. They present Jesus accurately & relevantly within the cultural core issues of the hip-hop generation. This book is a must read for every high-school or college student, their pastors & their parents."
4,Good Product,"Keeps my yorkie entertained, although not as long as I had hoped because he manages to get the treats out fairly quickly. I use his own treats in it rather than the Kong brand, which has worked well. Perfect size for little dogs."
3,Not such a useful or interesting toy,"My dog will get a treat out if I stuff it in the gripper, but otherwise ignores it completely. The best use I've found for it is holding ice cubes from the dispenser in the freezer door, the pup likes the cubes and putting them in the gripper makes it a little more interesting. It can also hold Greenies, which our dog then takes out and hides in a corner or buries outside. I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Take a lesson from Africa,"This informative book really opened my mind about child-rearing practices. It's so important to remember that Western culture is not the only one in the world and that we would do well to learn what other cultures have to offer us. Gusii parents in Kenya use what the authors call a ""pediatric"" way of raising children, contrasted to the ""pedagogical"" way Western parents tend to raise children. Many of the Gusii practices, which are generally concerned with protecting the comfort and health of the child, could be used by American parents beneficially.I especially liked the vignettes of the families towards the end of the book.This book is more appropriate for the person who is academically interested in the subject - it's not really soemthing the average person would sit down with for a good read."
5,Short but so sweet,"Telephone Jim Jesus, besides having the coolest name ever, is the most creative producer I have ever heard. This album runs short at 40 minutes, but every single track is bursting with creativity. This music is hardly comparable to other beat albums, because this CD is so artistic, creative, and wonderful. Its hard to explain it, but just buy this cd. I can't wait until he releases another album."
4,"Good product, Good Scent","This is a good product, with a great scent. This company ships quickly. I think this makes a great gift, especially if you buy matching lotions and or shower gels."
4,CRAP-TACULAR!,"Uncle John's Second Bathroom Reader is a great book when #2 is really on your mind. From cover to cover this book has tons of: trivia, answers to the inane, and things that you've probably heard before but forgot all about it.Anyone who has any allusions of trying to get on a TV trivia show (like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire) will definately want to familiarize themself with the writings of Uncle John. It's helped me expand my knowledge base greatly. I've also loved books like ""5087 Trivia Questions and Answers"" and ""American Trivia"", but Uncle John managed to keep me laughing while filling my head with facts. Frankly, I didn't want to leave the bathroom.Some little ditties you'll find in this volume...Thomas Crapper, Myth or Hero! Strange Lawsuits!! Churchill Speaks!!! Tales of 60's TV!!!! Common Phrases!!!!! The Gumby Story!!!!!! The Nut Behind Grape-Nuts!!!!!!! AND MUCH MUCH MORE...I loved this book and my advice...No outhouse is complete without it!"
3,A Smattering Of Gems and Snorers,"Released in one of the Gibb's slow periods (1972), this CD contains mostly a collection of individual works, most of it hodgepodge and forgettable. However, for the real Bee Gees fan, it is a must have. Other than the big hit, ""Run To Me"", other standout cuts are, ""Road To Alaska"", a unique toe-tapping rocker frequently used in concerts, ""Paper Mache, Cabbages & Kings"", a fun novelty song that bounces around with oddball lyrics, ""You Know It's For You"", A Maurice Gibb song that is one of his best lively mood songs and ""Alive"", a poorly received single that is one of the best written ballads the Bee Gees have done. It is worth a listen if not a purchase."
4,A Smattering Of Gems And Snorers,"Note: This is a re-issue until Rhino Records releases the Remastered Expanded version.Released in one of the Gibb's slow periods (1972), this CD contains mostly a collection of individual works, most of it hodgepodge and forgettable. However, for the real Bee Gees fan, it is a must have.

It is worth a listen if not a purchase."
4,Hooray for the Hunley!,"I'd waited years for this fine television production to be released on DVD (having seen it when broadcast some time ago) and I'm glad I waited. Despite the fact that the heroes of the story are Confederates, it's a moving based-on-facts tale of courage and loyalty, with fine performances from all the actors. I recommend it for those who fancy Civil War stories, submarine stories, or stories of heroism from any era. The protagonists may have been fighting for the wrong cause, but their bravery is still worth honoring."
4,good movie,"very good story enjoyed it , it was tastefully done how they died and really showed how brave they were"
4,The Huntley,This is a great DVD if you like early American military history. It is about the first submarine to be built and is portrayed quite well with good acting. It goes well with the DVD on the docoumentary on how and when they found the submarine's grave site and how they worked out how the men must of purished.
4,"A Little Uneven, But Gripping","If you like pretty movies, this one is not for you. It is almost sensual in that you can feel the desperation, fear and ultimate bravery of the crew. The casting is good and the performances excellent. Armand Assante's performance as Lt. Dixon is haunting, and there is no finer scene chemistry than an emotional scene between this actor and Donald Sutherland, discussing deaths in their respective families.I thought the subplot, although true, explaining Lt. Dixon's self-destructive streak was just a bit maudlin, but Armand Assante stopped it from being as bad as it could have been with some very understated acting."
4,Bravery personified,"I am constantly amazed by the bravery of the Civil War soldier. (Both Union and Confederate). The Hunley is just such an example. It's like volunteering to be the first human teleportation. Every crew who had been assigned to the ill fated sub had perished yet these brave few gave (to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln) their last full measure of courage and patriotism.As another reviewer had commented, the acting at times is a little cheesy and overdone. Nonetheless the story is compelling. Donald Sutherland, as P.T. Beauregard, is fabulous.For those who enjoy Civil War drama I highly recommend TNT's Andersonville directed by John Frankenheimer.The film is moving and tragic.Not being a legal or constitutional scholar I just have to state that despite the South's incredible immorality that was American Slavery that my reading of the Constitution supports the notion that legally the South was justified in succeeding from the union."
3,Ok video for a slow cold evening,"Not a bad story, but it is better when we saw the hunley displays and learned the history in book and real life.This movie leaves out some details and stretches the truth.Still not bad overall and pretty good acting and action."
2,Hynley,The film was old and not in perfect condition. I may not buy used again but I think that was all that was availale.
2,FOR HISTORY BUFFS AND OLD-TYME NAVAL FANS!,"Often boring account of the possible crew of the ill-fated crude submarine. Donald Sutherland has a small role. Interesting for history buffs, and for wooden ship naval fans. Otherwise, I've seen many better."
3,split down the middle,"I must admit the fast & loud stuff they do was the reason I bought this cd.I wasn't willing to sit through the ""lighter"" second half of the disc.But listening to it now (particularly ""Saturday Freedom"") I can hear that the second half may contain their better work.The last two cuts move dangerously close to Eagles territory.Interesting stuff for collectors of the famous-yet-obscure."
3,Fun psych Metal and 60's hard rock,"Blue Cheer lost their way due to constant personel changes. The First album was the first true Heavy Metal record. That one is still the best. Sloppy garage band very loud metal. The engineers must've had a hell of a time recording it back then. It has it's charm. And the next three albums had their moments. They morphed into a Steppenwolf kind of rock outfit with music that was a bit more varied. This assembles about 4 of the best tracks from each album. I took the fourth album to finally get the production right. If you like 60's scruffy garage psych, this is worth having. Nothing you'd listen to often, but if your nostalgic for the era. It's recomended."
2,All You Need To Own,"This band was ""Louder Than God,"" and ""Summertime Blues"" was a freaked-out hit for them. Listening to this CD, though, made me realize why they only had the one hit. The other stuff just isn't all that interesting. Maybe it was when it came out, since it was prototypical heavy metal, but now it just sort of sounds weak. And I was surprised that the sound quality is actually sort of thin. I know this was recorded in the '60s and recording technology wasn't what it is now, but still, it seems like no attempt was made to remaster the sound for the CD. It doesn't do justice to their reputation of being a sonic blitzkreig. (Well, maybe if you switch on the Dolby Pro Logic Surround and turn your stereo up to 11...)"
5,Honest & insightful,I truly enjoyed the devotions in this book. The questions at the end of the devotions were insightful. I thought their honesty and openness was refreshing. You will not be disappointed!!
1,not worth it!,"i almost bought this dvd but am glad i didn't. i rented it from netflix and i only made it through the first 15 minutes. this dvd is broken into segments so this is not one fluid yoga practice. also, the instructor does not talk during the video, she uses a voiceover. it's kind of creepy. she is staring straight at the camera (actually looking kind of pissed) and not saying a word as she goes through the poses. not recommended!"
2,Not worth the money for an experienced runner,"I bought this DVD in the hopes of improving my flexibility and helping to recover from some of the impact running has on my lower body... The DVD is fine, but after one watch I was frustrated that I had spent money on it. Most, if not all, of the moves covered in this video are stretching moves that I have already learned from running texts, coaches, etc. I don't normally do yoga, but I have done some version of most of these moves as routine stretching. For me, this felt like a total waste of money, unfortunately."
3,not bad,This watch is advertised as being able to withstand the rigours of being worn by an active child.However it very quickly became extremely scratched and the strap faded out badly. The strap also broke which made it impossible to wear.All of this transpired in the first 6 months.The watch itself goes well.
3,ok,"Shorts offer good compression, but only stretch in one direction (horizontally) and don't stretch up and down. They are also shorter than they appear in the pictures.The pair I received had a tear near the hem. The merchant was slow in responding to me (I had to contact them multiple times). The return process is very slow (still haven't received my refund)."
5,Buttery and Delicious,"When I read this delightful memoir, I felt like I had been invited to the best meals in town in the company of people who made me laugh and think. That's a good invitation to a lovely read."
4,Great illustrations,"The multiple views and illustrations are terrific. It didn't have one of just the veinous system that I was looking for but looks excellent for bones, muscles, and nerves."
4,Informative Human Anatomy Guide for Students & Lay people,"The ADAM Student Atlas of Anatomy is an interesting and informative illustrated guide to human anatomy. This concise book, organized by body systems has color-coded tabs denoting each section for ease of use. The various parts of the human anatomy are clearly labeled, and both full color illustrations and photos from actual cadavers are provided.This anatomy atlas could be a helpful guide to anyone who works in a non-medical field where one works with people facing medical issues. Or, as the title suggests, it can be a helpful guide for students. There are certainly other anatomy atlases that are more detailed, however for the concise size, and its stated purpose, this is a very good illustrated guide to human anatomy. Recommended."
5,JUST WHAT I NEEDED,As an Ortho-Bionomy Practitioner I have delved into many Anatomy & Physiology Books for information. They just didn't illustrate what I was searching for.At last I can journey into the 'works' to how and where I am 'meeting' with my client's issues.Anne PatersonPractitionerBrisbane Qld Australia
5,Understanding Anatomy,"The A.D.A.M. Student Atlas of Anatomy takes a very creative approach to understanding the human body. Although it was developed for medical students, the entire volume is filled with 3-dimensional color illustrations, which makes the complex systems of the body accessible to anyone who chooses to delve into the book. The detail provided makes this an invaluable learning tool for medical students as well as undergraduate and graduate students."
5,Ever Wonder What Makes YOU Tick?,"Let's face it, we all love to be our own doctors. The inquisitiveness of the human race means that we are always wanting to know more about the unknown. Without a doubt, one of the biggest unknowns is just what makes up the human body. With the ADAM Student Atlas of Anatomy, that question can now be answered in full colored detail.This book was obviously designed for students in the medical field, but I also think this is a perfect coffee table book for households who encourage open thinking and discussion. Why do I say this? Because this book goes into sometimes vivid detail on how our bodies are put together, and some people, sadly, just can't handle that type of stuff. For the other 99% of us, this book would get more attention than anything else you could possibly put on your coffee table!The rich colors, true photos in some cases, and attention to detail really set this book apart. It's a book I can say with all honesty I'll be ""reading"" for years to come."
4,Poland,"I didn't care for this disc when I borrowed it from a friend. But years later I listened to it and realized that I was judging it unfairly. The songs are nothing special, but you can hear his unique tone and style of play which separates him from everyone else."
4,"Melodic, intense and razor sharp","This is one of the few great ""instrumental thrash"" albums. What I find most interesting is the high contrast between Chris's razor-sharp rhythm guitar playing and his silky-smooth lead playing. The drummer (I believe it's Chris's brother) is simply amazing and sounds great. The only reason I've given this a 4-star rating instead of 5 is because, though the songs all have their own character, listening to Chris's somewhat long-winded solos can be tedious at times. His technique is so refined that his solos sound much the same, because he has his own style and is not just another replica. He doesn't sound like anyone else - he sounds like Chris Poland, and, though it may feel a bit stretched, it's definitely a good thing."
4,Awesome metal instrumental album,"Chris Poland proves with this album that he deserves to be at the top of the most musically talented guitarists of the 1980s. Each song is different in its own way. From the thrashy title track, to the jazzy Alexandria, to the fusion Row of Crows, this album is complete. The reviewer who gave this album one star is obviously not able to hear good music. Poland may not be the fastest guitar player on the planet, but his melodies and soul more than make up for it."
2,Mega-average,"I got Chris Poland's Return to Metroplois because I'm a huge Megadeth fan, and the first two albums with Poland are by far my favorites. This Poland CD is good- as a guitarist I love his playing... but the CD doesn't blow me away. It's kind of like instrumental Megadeth without the edge. Without Dave Mustaine as a partner Poland obviously loses the lyrical/vocal input, but Mustaine's guitar playing also gives Megadeth a sense of reckless abandon. Poland is very by-the-book. I have to respect this CD, but it's not something I listen to a lot. I like EVERY Megadeth album better than this Chris Poland album. Chris Poland is a great guitar player, but that doesn't always translate into a great songwriter."
1,YOU'V GOT TO BE KIDDING,"These revieweres must have their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks or this is the first and only instrumental guitar CD they own. This is heavy metal dross at it's most infuriating. Yes he is fast. BUT he has absolutely no taste or talent, his tone is akin to a chainsaw hitting concrete and not nearly as pleasent. This CD is like snippets of every heavy metal cliche grouped together to form about 4 - 5 mins of the most repetetive noise. The drumming is almost as boring as the guitar playing and even the middle bits ( solos ) would be (junk) on any metal CD.The obligatory accoustic guitar bit is also there and proves that he can't play that either. It sounds like someone practisingscales and shredd like chords, when a drummer walks in."
5,"Chris Poland : ""Return To Metropolis 2002""","***** - FIVE STARS==================I never realized how talented C. Poland was until I heard this. He is so much better than his days in Megadeth would allow, and here he let's loose. This is a highly melodic journey from start to finish, with crunching riffs underlying great solo's that are woven over the top of the riffs. His brother, M. Poland supplies impressive percussions that fit into this style perfectly. These two brothers are highly talented musicians....To describe this, it's galloping riffs sound like early day Iron Maiden, and the solos remind me alot of guitarist J. Matheos and old-school Fates Warning, along with similarities to Coroner's Tommy T. Baron, which focuses on a soaring, bluesy feel....No vocals, but you don't need them here, the music speaks for itself. All in all, making one incredible release. The production is also flawless. I can't wait to buy his entire collection. He's a wizard axeman..."
4,WIFI Max works ... XP Operating System Compatability Potential Issues,"For what the product offers, it performs it's functionality. Easy to use for file conversion and transfer. As a wireless device, for it's size the range is well worth it with a strong signal. The only potential issue was that during installation a warning message that the software was not certified with my operating system (Windows XP, early release) was displayed. Of course, I installed regardless. After 6 weeks of non-issues I received the ""blue screen of death"" when I powered-up my computer. Normally, my PC is always powered-up. The only way to recover was to install the operating system from scratch. Well, you guessed it ... install everything from scratch, as well. I've not installed the WIFI Max again, not because I don't want but in a couple of weeks I will be purchasing a new PC. My old PC will be used as a server and if it crashes again after the WIFI Max is installed, this would be of no issue. Just re-install."
1,"Not worth it, no support","I bought this traveling for work, and found that it couldn't share an internet connection with Windows XP, and there's no online support to help. The only number listed for support was in Europe...so do yourself a favor and buy a wifi router instead."
3,"Good, but only for those with patience","I got Wi-Fi max to use with a program for X-Kai Link. For that purpose, it worked only some of the time. It took me a few hours to finnally get the bugs out of the system, but if you are willing to spend those few hours, it's a reliable product."
2,my review,"Well we bought it thinking great we need it. But one problem, it does not work with Windows 7.. there is no driver for it."
3,Please Justify,I've used this before and it's a decent item but the price of 70+ isn't justifiable for it nor warranted for it. Like people have said this thing is a hassle to get up and running in the first place. If you want a 4 player team for Monster Hunter Freedom however you may want one of these. Since I'm hearing these may be phased out in the coming year that makes the price less viable. These usually go fo 29 - 34 with overnight shipping bringing it to 50-60 not a penny more. If you can deal with getting your hands dirty it's a better idea to purchase an old linksys router with firm ware you're able to mod and do it that way. Less pain and alot less cost.
2,Works sometimes,"All I can say is, sometimes it works, sometimes it causes Windows to crash. I have had to reinstall this device as many times as I have used it..."
1,Won't work,"When this thing had finally arrived, I was all hyped up and ready to have some fun with people on Xlink Kai and MHF1. I did not have fun though, as the product would only allow me to connect to the game to the point where I could see other players name, but was unable to play with the people."
1,SUCKS,"It took me awhile 2 get it working, and when i did it was very faulty. I got a lot of network errors. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!"
1,WIFI JUNK,Could not get it to work. Many other reviews say the same thing. Don't buy!! Still waiting for refund!!
1,Too much hassle-Updated-,"If you're looking for ""plug and play simplicity"", keep looking!! The software didn't recognize the hardware. The manufacturere's website listed some ways to almost get this to work. Sadly, almost is the closest I came. I e-mailed customer support and just got a response.Too late, this one's going back."
1,stinks,the things horrible i cant get it to work with windows vista i tried for like 3 weeks and i had to download this and that and the thing still didnt work so until they come out with a windows vista version i rate this as a 1 if i could get to a 0 id do it. VISTA USERS DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Nice One!,"Besides the hit version of 'Mas' there are 3 other versions of 'Mas' on this album. These are bonus tracks. There are other good songs on this album so no complaints. Oh, and there's a sort of poster inside the CD box to keep the girls happy."
5,Since 1993,"How many of you actually have one of these laying around? If your name is Andrew and your boys name is Mike then you've probably got this fine piece of audio equipment. I remember carrying this thing around the neighborhood in 93 and rockin it to football practices. Sony products are great and this is no exception. For years, it has delivered listening pleasure and still sounds as great as it did day 1.If I were you, I would definitely buy this if it miraculously became available on Amazon.com."
1,Be Careful!,Ad shows quantity of 60 ea. For $19.00 + shipping. Verified with company. $19.00 only gets you 20 ea.
1,"Worthless, useless, total rip off","This is one of the worst software books I've seen in my life. The title should be ""An introduction to the most basic ideas of UML and VB for certified idiots"". But the authors have the galls to call this a book for developers, and that is downright dishonest: The book is written in large font and wide margins to fill space (the left margin alone is more than 2 inches -about one third of the page). And that's nothing compared to the amount of code: Out of 450 pages, less than 30 pages contain some, and they are ALL in an appendix. Wait!...it gets worse: the code doesn't have *any* of the new VB6 new features, it's all VB5!!! All database access is done via DAO (that's VB4), there is not even a passing reference to ADO. What? are you still reading? don't waste your time with this book, if you are looking for a serious book on VB6 and UML, check out VB6 UML by Jake Sturm, from WROX Press."
1,worst computer book i've read in ages,"I buy at least 25 technical/computer books a year and I can definitely say this is the worst one I've bought in the last year. I think I'll go and buy the Addison-Wesley one.This book is vague and littered with manager-speak. Not for developers at all (there is no code, for a start off). If you have ANY understanding of objects and classes you will find the first 4 chapters completely useless.It did have a reasonably good bibliography, but it's like they're saying, haha we tricked you into buying our book, now go read the good ones..."
4,good uml & oop intro,"This book is a good intro to the object features of Visual Basic 6.0 and a good intro to UML Notation as well. The book illustrates various kinds of UML diagrams using Visual Modeler and Rational Rose, which are in many cases quite similar. Gives lots of attention to the structured analysis/design phases of building an app, and some discussion of component-based application development. Book has lots of diagrams and an appendix with a web-enabled sample application which has example of implementing OOP techniques using VB."
1,the worst book available for VB 6 OR UML!!!! : (,"I would not even give it one star! As a practicing OOAD professional for the past 6 years,I reviewed this book for a friend wanted to learn OO and UML as it relates to VB 6. This book is just wrong in some places and assumes you know things in others."
3,It's Only OK,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn about Visual Modeler. However, I was quite dissapointed. There is not even a Visual Modeler example. The Visual Basic example from their web site is not working properly either. This book is probably suitable for manager, but it's definitely not for developer."
1,A book without much usefulness,"Just read this book because I thought it may have some useful information regarding UML. I can't find much as other reviewers indicated. On page 296, there are a few statements discussing the difference between OODB and relational database. Not only the authors don't know what they are talking about, they seem even don't have proper English writing skill and logic to form their argument regarding using OODB."
2,Doesn't explain solutions,"I was looking for engaging software for my 7th grade son to practice and increase understanding of math concepts. There's plenty of practice here, but no explanation of how to figure out problems that were solved incorrectly. Not helpful as a tutorial."
5,The big dog on the block.,"I bought this for my Remington 700 VTR 22-250. Quick and easy mounting with quality rings. I did a mechanical zero and I was on the paper at 50 and 100 yards. Once I sighted it in for 100 I moved to 150, adjusted and then settled on 200 for a perfect zero. After a year of shooting it is still holding that same spot. The scope comes with 3 sizes of turrets, I like the small ones, but the large tactical ones look really good. Every time I get it out other people stop and gawk at the scope and everyone who shoots it loves the clarity. One of the guys was reading the Gatorade nutrition facts off our targets at 100 yards. I was able to hit consistently at 300 yards. At first I thought the fine cross-hair was too fine, but once you get to 200+ anything else would be too big. I bought it directly from Amazon and it arrived in perfect condition."
2,Second Hand Parts.......,"the scope came in a opened box,you folks purchased it from someone else than the manufacture,there were missing parts,the experiance was distasteful, you sold the unit as new, it was not newTerrance Silva"
5,Great compilation!,"I don't normally waste my time writing reviews...but this release is a winner. All these songs are hits! Some of them are must haves! Including ""The Impossible"" by Joe Nichols. ""I'm Movin' On"" by Rascall Flats. ""I Breath In, I Breath Out"" by Chris Cagle. This compilation has 17 songs..all hits! Can't beat that for the price! If your a country fan and like to have the classics that will be listened to for years...there are more than a few on this compilation. A few other favorites of mine that are on this compilation are, ""The Best Day"" by George Strait. ""Wrapped Around"" by Brad Paisley. ""Just What I Do"" by Trick Pony. If you are a serious country fan...you will already know that these songs. For others who are looking for a great hits country compilation covering that last couple of years of country...this compilation is a must!"
5,Country Fan from CA,"AWESOME!!! A must have for all country fans. Usually, when you buy a CD like this there is at least one song that you skip over each time you listen. Not this one. It's perfect. Highly recommend you add this to your collection."
3,iPod Silicon Case,"To protect your iPod agains hits and falls, this Silicon Case is very good and safe but, from a functional point of view, the silicon covering the Pad Wheel reduces its sensibility so the manipulation of the iPod becomes difficult"
4,"Great case, poor clip & hold button spot","This is a great case that will keep your ipod protected. For what I'm going to use it for it will be fine (using it at work, in the car, and around the home). If you are a runner or plan on using this clip, look somewhere else. The clip is poor, at best. Flimsy plastic that is thin. I feel that I'm going to break it just by looking at it. My only other complaint is the hold button spot. On the case there is an outline of where the hold button is, but I wasn't able to turn on and off the hold button though the case. I cut my case in order to adapt for that. Even then, it makes turn on and off the hold a bit of a challenge unless you have long fingernails. Getting the Ipod in is easy to me, so I don't know what other people were talking about. Overall I do enjoy the product, but nothing is perfect of course."
1,Click wheel has no response in case,"Once in the case the click wheel has very poor response. How could it, it is completely covered by rubber? It is very strange that there are not more posts regarding this. It seems defective by design."
4,Great protection!,"My teenager frequently ""borrows"" my iPod and has recently fessed up to dropping and/or bonking it on several occassions. So far, my iPod continues to play and I can only attribute this to the excellent protection the iSkin Eclipse provides."
4,Good skin...good price.,This is a very good skin for 60 GB & 80 GB owners. It completely covers the entire iPod without sacrificing functionality. What separates this skin from other skins it the Visor (a plastic shield which protects the screen). My only problem with this skin is the belt clip. It is impossible to remove and difficult to use. A better belt clip would make this the perfect skin. This is a very good price from TechGNet.
4,Almost perfect!,"This case is the most pratical I've found. The Ipod is totally protect... the only characterisc to improve is related to the hold button protection: as it is difficult to ""lock"" and ""unlock"" the Ipod when it is into the ISkin case, we have or to take the case off (the left superior corner), or to use our nails to proceed with the ""hold"" - and this can damage the case, tearing it.I really recomend the purchase, I always tell my friends to buy this case and nobody has complained untill now! They are also satisfied with that."
4,Great but minor problem,"Everything works great. the clip was taken off because I don't use them, and have personally never seen a 60gb/80gb ipod user wear one. The only problem I have with this one is the hold button is a little hard to use. However, I took it off, used a knife and cut it out easily, now works perfectly and looks great still. The dail works better in my honest opinion, it was a little too sensative before, but now is perfect. Everyone who sees it on my ipod asks where they can get one and usually do."
4,"Good protection, exterior feel is not great",This product will protect your iPod from scrapes and bruises. The outer material is not all that pleasing to the touch (mine) but this will be subjective. It does serve the main purpose for which I purchased it and that's to protect a pretty expensive MP3/movie player.
3,Doesn't really dock with all ipod docks,"I was so excited that this case would allow me to dock my ipod without remvoing it. Unfortunately, this is exactly true. It may work with some, but with my ihome ih5 clock radio it certainly doesn't. In fact, i don't think it would dock with ANY docking accessory without cutting the flap off on the bottom that coverers plugin. However it if you did this, it may dock on some...just not the ihome ih5.Other than that, it is a really great case. Once you get your ipod in it, it's in it! I can't imagine it getting damaged. Of course if you need to take it out of the case often (to dock it as stated above), then it's a bit of work to get it back together."
5,Has Never Done Me Wrong!,I have had excellent as well as rave reviews on my Creme Brulee with the basic recipe from this book! I highly recommend it as it is simple as well as very pleasing - Enjoy!
5,CREME BRULE' RECIPE BOOK,"THIS BOOK IS JUST FULL OF GREAT, EASY TO PREPARE CUSTARD RECIPES. WORTH EVERY PENNY AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT"
4,For the Creme Brulee Lover,All kinds of creme brulees. This is an outstanding cookbook on a one style of dessert and has many varieties and helps and serving suggestions. Favorite is the chocolate box presentation suggestion. Everyone seems to go for creme brulee!
4,"Good Book, Great Pictures","It was a very good book that presents a number of fine examples on Creme Brulee. The photos are great, and the recipes seem easy enough to follow."
5,WONDERFUL addition to the cookbook collection,"If you LOVE Creme Brulee and want to make it yourself - this is a great cookbook! This book is very small - and fits nicely on my cookbook shelf.The recipes: From the classic creme brulee to the more exotic recipes including Fruit or Liqueur variations of creme brulee. I've already tried the classic recipe and it is wonderful.There are some other ""unique"" creme brulee recipes, but that just opens the door to try new and creative ways of making creme brulee (example: Sweet Corn creme brulee or the Red Bell Pepper Creme Brulee).The book also includes a section on cooking methods, equipment needed, ingredients, etc to make it easier for the novice.Overall a great book and a great gift for a Creme Brulee lover! If you buy it as a gift - you may want to include other items to go with it such as the Williams Sonoma Creme Brulee kit complete with the torch and small dishes for serving. I believe you can buy all those separately on Amazon.com as well."
4,Creme brulee addicts....order now!,"Yum....if you are on a quest to find the perfect creme brulee, order this book and try out some of the recipes included! From the basic custard with the crusty brown sugar top to a margarita creme brulee, this book has lots of recipes I'm dying to try. Great gift for your cooking (or gourmet dessert) friends."
5,Incredible new talent!,"I learned about this CD on, of all places, MySpace, and decided to give it a try...it hasn't been out of my six disc changer since I got it in April.There's something so appealing about Ms. Muir's voice...it's got an innocent vulnerability and a worldiness at the same time. I've enjoyed this album more than any new artist I've heard since I first heard Karrin Allyson.I'm hoping that Ms Muir has a long and successful career. Buy this CD."
5,Meguiars 2000 Unigrit,"Very good quality sandpaper, did not leave the deep deep scratches like the standard 3M paper I got at the local parts store which I could never buff out. I had to resand with the Meguiars 2000 and buff it again. Highly recommend this paper."
5,One of Jerry Goldsmith's best soundtracks ...,"This CD belongs to every Jerry Goldsmith fan ... ""Raid On Leonesse"", ""To Leonesse"" and ""Arthur's Farewell"" are fantastic. This soundtrack is far from bad..."
3,It's O.K.,"I mostly listen to this to go to sleep once in awhile. Not bad, but compares poorly to the Excalibur and King Arthur soundtracks. I downloaded it on my X Box hard drive after I rented it from the library. It's not boring elevator music, but like one of those battlefield movie scenes. A little tongue in cheek."
5,A must have recording for Jerry Goldsmith fans.,"Another musical score from Jerry Goldsmith, garanteed to generate goosebumps."
3,Actually more like 3 and a half,"Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad soundtrack, and I like it. But when you have around 50 soundtracks, some have to rate higher than others, and this one is not as great as a number of them. The main theme for it is beautiful and moving, and the romantic theme is nice as well. However, some of the action cues are a bit to intense for easy listening. A lot of banging and clanging, and not much melody. But overall, I would still say this is a worthwhile CD, although as almost all Varese Sarabande soundtracks, it's short (A little over 30 mins.). Plus, if you are a Goldsmith fan in general, this is a must have. So like I said, not as low as three, but not as high as a four."
4,"Hail, King Goldsmith","""First Knight"" is one of the most triumphant scores ever written by Jerry Goldsmith. The theme for Arthur -or Camelot, according to the way you want to put it -is spectacular, touching, and catchy. The love theme is bittersweet, yet very romantic.But what makes me give this album four stars is its length. At forty minutes, you get to hear Arthur's theme triumphantly, together with the love theme, in 'Camelot Lives' and 'Promise Me', and a piece of spectacular battle music for orchestra and chorus in 'Arthur's Farewell'. However, there is music missing in the album, you feel like kinda incomplete. This is a great Jerry Goldsmith composition that truly deserves an expanded edition."
5,I'M READY FOR MY CLOSE-UP!!,"I bought this calendar in NYC two years ago and loved it each and every day. Last Christmas, I bought several calendars (cats and dogs) to give away to my pet friends, and it was a big hit with everyone! The pictures of the cats are hilarious, and the calendar is beautifully designed.A calendar like this will make the world a better place, I'm sure, for animals and humans!"
3,Mixer head wobbles,"I bake bread every week. The mixer head wobbles back and forth while kneading the dough. Also, the flange on the dough hook is not wide enough to prevent dough from climbing over it and upward to the mixer body.I bought this mixer because arthritis makes it difficult for me to move heavy objects. Otherwise I would have bought a Kitchen Aid."
4,Hamilton Beach stand mixer,"I'm very happy with this appliance. It does its job efficiently and quickly, and the all-metal finish looks good on my countertop. It takes some strength to push in the back button to raise and lower the mixer head, but that's a very minor inconvenience. No need to spend nearly twice as much for a Kitchen Aid!"
1,Gave it a shot and it failed.,Bought this mixer for a friend after reading mostly good reviews of it. She made one batch of cookies and all was going well until she started it up again a few minutes after making the first batch. A horrible grinding noise and the attachments weren't rotating. Sigh. Shipped it back to Amazon the next day and I'm now looking for a good price on the Kitchen Aid.
2,Underpowered,"Nice easy to clean mixer but not up to the job. A double batch of banana bread, which was not a particularly thick batter, and the smoke started to pour out of it. Returned and replaced it with a commercial Hamilton Beach which is doing just fine."
4,Great! What took me so long?,"This is the first experience I have had with standing mixers. I bought the Hamilton Beach because of reviews and price. I am totally satisfied. It looks beautiful,brushed stainless and very shiny. Metal construction, very solid.I'm not sure all standing mixer are quiet but this one is. I made many batches of cookies and couldn't believe how fast and easy it was. Can't wait to use it again!"
5,Excellent creamer and mixer!,"This mixer creams butter and sugar fast and easy, and does a good job of scraping the sides of the bowl. I like the handle on the bowl, and finish is beautiful. It is heavy, though it's not as much of a problem if it has a dedicated spot on the counter top. I have to lift it from a lower shelf to use it. And a ""pause"" button would have been nice, you wouldn't have to turn it off just to make a quick adjustment. Overall, I am very happy with it and do recommend it if you do a lot of baking, like I do."
3,Not so good,"Good machine, but some troubles that does not are supposed to have: plastic pinion gone whit 10 months of regular use (no spare parts for this model at our country, since it was imported by a wholesaler, so regional warranty provider gave us their back). Base bolts loosen up frequently."
5,Great mixer!,"I'm loving my mixer! Every year for the holidays I bake about 20 batches of pumpkin/banana/apple/cranberry bread to give to my friends and family. This mixer made it a breeze. I was doing double or even 2.5 batches at once. It never hesitated, even with the thickest dough. I had to scrape the sides once at the end on a few of the thicker recipes, but that was all! I do wish the top of the bowl was a little wider, since I found that the splash guard was really more hassle than it's worth (to me anyway). This mixer cleans up easily, looks gorgeous on my counter-top, and works great. Next: pizza dough!"
4,hamilton beach,"I like my mixer very much. I absolutely love the color. The only concern I have is that it is very noisy and I don't have another Hamilton Beach stand mixer to compare it to so that I can see if that is normal. My sisters both have KitchenAids and they say that my mixer is noisy. The first time that I used the mixer it was very upsetting. I turned it on and I expected the smell because the manual said that would be normal, but the mixer suddenly shut off and that made me very nervous. I unplugged it and allowed it to sit while I used my handheld mixer. About an hour later I turned it on and it did come on and I have been able to use it ever since. Overall, I find it to be a great product. Thank you for asking my opinion."
1,Huge dissappointment,"If you've ever used a KitchenAid stand mixer, just know that this is not even close to an equivalent replacement. The power is noticably lower, and the whisk does not get close to the bottom of the bowl. As a result I have to kind of hold the bowl up manually so that things like whip cream and egg whites mix properly. This kind of defeats the whole purpose of the stand mixer. And even mixing simple things like that take so much longer.You are paying a much lower price than for the KitchenAid, but there's a reason for it. If your standard of performance is the KitchenAid, then I really don't recommend this product."
5,great mixer,"I have made bread, cupcakes, and cakes with this mixer. When I made the bread I thought for a moment it was going to take on a life of it's own but I lowered the speed and it worked great! I know I didn't write a lot but I don't feel the need to, it works great!"
3,TV chefs are paid to push products...,I am looking for a new stand mixer.. All I seem to find is Kitchenaid.... I refuse to buy this overpriced product.. You can buy individual machines to do what the attachments do MUCH CHEAPER.Why do consumers buy into the hype?????I doubt this will be published.
1,Does not stand by their products,"I don't know why anyone has stated that this company is making decent products. I opened a brand new mixer from Hamilton Beach last night and the weld on the beater is broken. I called to ask for a replacement and was simply told ""too bad"". What happened to the ""fit for purpose"" law where a consumer should expect a product to perform for the purpose that it was made? Clearly, they do not stand by their products, so I will never purchase Hamilton Beach products again."
2,UNSATISFACTORY,"TWO SURFACES MARRED. INGREDIENTS FALL INTO THE SLOT BESIDE THE BOWL LOCKI HAVE TO LIFT THE BEATER OUT OF THE BOWL TO USE A SPATULA TO CLEAN THE SIDES OF THE BOWL. WHEN I TOOK THE SPEED UP TO 6, THE MIXER STARTED JUMPING. THE MIXER STAND LOOKS ABUSED."
2,Xylophone out of tune,Buyer beware- we gave this gift to our neices for Christmas and were horrified at how out of tune the xylophone was- my husband is a music teacher and was so mad that it wasn't even chromatic and horribly out of tune he is purchasing a replacement xylophone so the kids don't misunderstand musical octaves! The other percussive instruments are fine and the harmonica and recorder were okay.
5,fun for the kids!,"I got this for my 2 yr old but may other kids who are 4 and 6 love this too! My children are very musical so they have a great time marching around playing with these instruments. The favorite seems to be the wooden xylophone. After about 4 days, unfortunately, the xylophone looks pretty beat up ( dented from the cubed sticks and paint chips off). Aside from that, I find this toy to be very educational."
3,Middle of the road,"We're a musical family so it seemed appropriate to buy this set early on. My biggest complaint is the actual usability of the instruments. The holes in the recorder are poorly drilled making it play out of tune. The xylophone is the same; the bars are inappropriately sized making it impossible to play even the simplest of tunes. Perhaps these are irrelevant details to some consumers but to us, they're deal breakers. If you intend to manufacture and market musical instruments they should be, well, musical."
2,tuneless xylophone,"When we ordered this set we were especially excited about the xylophone, which turned out to be shoddily made and completely out of tune. Don't order this set if you want to make music with it, or if you're expecting quality workmanship. On the plus side, there are a variety of noises to be made and the baby seems to like it well enough."
4,Love it - Xylophone is poor though,"Awesome instruments - great value. Love the flute, harmonica and kazoo. Great quality wood. Xylophone is almost useless though - made from wood so poor if any sound, very little difference in the keys. Overall very happy with purchase!"
4,"Great idea, semi-poor quality of instruments","My daughter (18 months) loves the instruments, but the only thing that really has any decent sound quality is the harmonica. The flute does not work at all. Overall very nice variety of instruments and colors."
4,Michael Makes Music,"I bought these musical instruments for my grandson Michael for his 2nd birthday. He loves to ""make music"" and is especially fond of the harmonica and the recorder. The only problem with these instruments is the xylophone. It is really lame! I'd suggest the maker of these toys replace the wooden bars on the xyleophone with metal bars. It would sound much more melodic and be more fun for the child. Other than the xylophone, I would heartily recommend purchasing these instruments for toddlers."
4,Wonderful for the blooming percussionist,This was a great buy!!! My 3yo twin girls love this. The intruments are all made of wood and of good quality. They stand up to the abuse and roughness of young children. The colors are bright and engaging. Glad I bought this.
2,low quality product,This is a poorly constructed group of instruments. The kazoo and xylophone were broken and the recorder can barely carry a tune. Try and find this product in a store so you can check it out for yourself.
3,Good product for a 2-year old,"I bought this for my 4-year old daughter's birthday because she really wanted a xylophone and this is the only one that I could find! The xylophone is, by far, the worst instrument in the whole set. The notes are way off tune and the sound is muffled.Her favorite piece is the harmonica, which is pretty nice. The rest of the instruments are okay, but avoid this product of you are looking for a nice xylophone."
1,Please save yourself the disappointment.,"These instruments may be nice to look at, but that's all they're good for. The xylophone was the biggest let-down... all the notes sound very much the same. The kazoo doesn't make a sound at all. I couldn't distinguish between the notes on the recorder either. I won't even get into what I think of all the other pointless pieces of wood in this box. When I opened it, wood shavings were all over the instruments. Each instrument is tied down to the box with at least two wire things... so frustrating! If you want some random objects for your child to bang around, this is for you. IF YOUR CHILD IS ACTUALLY MUSICALLY INCLINED, he/she won't benefit from this is any way. I'm returning it immediately."
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap!!!,"Do NOT buy this product! It is SO cheaply made- I can't believe I had to spend $50 on it! The xylophone is essentially without tune completely; each ""note"" is just a dull thud, with several of them sounding exactly the same. The recorder is also completely out of tune and falls apart easily. My daughter has a wonderful recorder from Target that cost me $3 and is much better quality. Most of the other pieces don't require a tone, so I guess they're fine, although you can look at them and remark at how cheap they look. I'm going to try to return mine. Don't waste your money!!!!"
2,OK for the kids,When you drop these balls on a flat surface they will bounce all over the place. You get what you pay for. They are OK for the kids to slam into each other.
1,VERY BAD ODER!!!,"We bought these ping-pong balls for our cat to play with. However, we CANNOT let her play with them now, IF EVER! They smell like a chemical waste dump! It is horrible! I have had the box in the garage for several days (opened) in the hope it will air out. So far, after a few days they are still very much like a toxic waste dump!I certainly don't want my cat to get sick from playing with her toys. Just so you folks know, most cats love to chase ping-pong balls on a hard floor. Carpet makes it impractical."
2,Balls are dead,I bought a new indoor - outdoor table and bought these balls. The balls are not lively at all. For a while I thought it was the table then I got some other balls and now I know that it is these balls. I do not recomend you buy these. The price is great. The packaging is nice and convenient. But the balls are dead and not great quality. Sopend more andd get something decent.
3,Decent Balls at a Great Price,These are good balls for practice or use on basement tables but NOT competition quality. They are better than I expected and we are enjoying them.
1,Lots of compatability problems,"This product never loaded properly. It depends on a very old version of Quicktime (2.x). With this version it still generates a DLL error. The newer Quicktime 5.0 version generates an unable-to-open window message. Old and new versions of Quicktime can't co-exist on my Win98SE system. The worst part was the tech. support, or lack of it. Spent hours on line (total over several days) and never talked to a human. I never hung up on the line, it always cut me off after 20 minutes or so. Very frustrating. This dependence on obsolete software and further lack of technical support means that I must recommend that you don't buy this product."
2,"Fun games, but...","I got this for my 8 year old, who loved the various games, but really wasn't learning to type. There aren't enough lessons for real beginners to develop some skills and speed before they have to start earning points for games. Also the length of time some of the games took to earn points was way too long. I'm an extremely experienced typist and even I got tired. So, I'm in the market for something else..."
2,Jumpstart Typing,"I thought it was a good game but, it went too fast. It would be more fun if it gave you more time to learn. I got frustrated with it because of that."
1,Defective Program,This program displayed upside down on all three of our computers. Knowledge Adventure Customer Service was absolutely terrible -- basically nonexistent.
1,Does not teach typing to beginners,I thought I would be getting a program to teach typing. This seems for children who already know the basics.
5,Extremely useful resource for my family,"This book has been an extremely useful resource for my family. ""Food for Thought"" and ""Recipe for Success"" highlight boxes made this book very easy reading to skim through and eye-opening stories about real people made it a book I read from cover to cover. I refer to the corresponding web site regularly. It is a real asset for my family's use of the book's eight-week plan to reduce our weight."
1,Tim Hardin revised,"If you are looking for a CD copy of Hardin's 1968 LP album, ""Tim Hardin 3: Live in Concert"" with sidemen Mike Mainieri, Eddie Gomez, Don McDonald, et.al., look elsewhere. This isn't it. Same tunes and same names, but that is the only similarity between the CD and the LP. CD has orchestra versions complete with violins and that couldn't be further from Hardin's style, especially with the cited sidemen. In short, the CD is a terrible version of Tim Hardin's work...."
5,"tim hardin, reason to believe (the best of)","i ordered this cd just to hear the man who wote reason to beleive. (for rod stuart) holly cow! where has this guy been all my life?this is a major artist in every sense of the word. his haunting voice and sparce arrangments really let him tell his stories,mechancoly as they may be. if i were a carpenter brings tears to my eye no matter how many times i play it. every song on this collection is a true gem. i highly recomend it, as i can't live without it. shakey jake key west fl."
4,Excellent For Its Day,"This bio was actually written years ago. It is entertaining and expresses the wishes of its subject and the style that was most accepted at the time for publishing purposes. If you are interested in a biography of legend Milton Berle from another perspective, his son Billy's, pick up a copy of My Father, Uncle Miltie. You will be treated to an insider's view of Milton's life as well as the entertainment industry. However, the Frankel book is nonetheless a good read, but My Father, Uncle Miltie shows more of the man."
1,Poorly Constructed Video,"I was very disappointed with this dvd. It was sloppily compiled with no information as to where each skater ranked or what skate they were performing before showing each piece. They told who the winners were upfront, there was absolutely no suspence and they left out many of the top performances. They should take a lesson from Bud Greenspan's videos where some background information is given and there is a build up to the final outcome. I think someone wanted to make some money and just half heartily slapped some performances together. Too bad...they didn't do justice to the many surprising and outstanding skating performances of this Olympics."
5,Good acquisition ¡=),"I bought this tv 2 years ago, and tell you, it was a great acquisition, I used it as tv as well as second monitor of my pc, the only difficulty is that my kid (4 years old) use it without difficulty and since 1 year this tv belong to him =)"
4,good lcd combo tv,"I own this TV for almost an year, bought it from SEARS during thanksgiving sale. So far i am happy with it.Only complaint being v slow in responding while changing chanels"
4,As expected,"As others have said, the sound level is rather low (but fine for a bedroom) and there is an annoying lag between channels when surfing, but the picture quality is quite good, I've had no problem playing DVDs, and in general I am quite satisfied."
1,Because Zero stars isn't an option,"I bought this TV as a gift for my wife. Within 6 months, the power supply is dead. The power supply may be undersized to accomodate the built-in DVD player. Of course, no one will take for repairs so i guess it will clutter the land fill. This is a truly awful product. Stay away."
2,I expected better from Sharp,"This was one of the free TVs that Verizon was giving away with their FIOS promotion, so perhaps Sharp makes a special ""crummy edition"" for Verizon.The only pro is that HD stations look nice and sharp. The DVD player is VERY fussy about what it will play. None of my home-made DVDs work, so I've had to connect an external player to watch home movies. All lo-def DVDs that I play look pretty bad on it. Using the same dvd player, they look great on my Vizio 37"". I'd think it'd be the other way around.If you need to be quiet and want to connect headphones, you need to pull the tv out, get to the back of it and remove a panel to access the a/v input area.If it wasn't free, I'd return it."
3,Slow channel change,"Several annoying things - Slow change between channels, (takes 1 - 2 seconds for next channel to be displayed), No last channel button, volume not very loud on some channels and dvds, (have it at 50 and still not that loud). Other than these things it's OK."
4,A WONDERFUL READ,"I very rarily have time to read. With two small boys I usually don't find the time for myself. I bought this book and I finished it in two days! I couldn't put this book down, it was very good. I felt like I was right there in the story."
2,Haven't I read this before?,"I got a tremendous sense of deja vu while reading this book. The main storyline between the parents was very familiar - I've read similar stories in number of books, and this one didn't add anything new to it. The reason for the intial separation didn't ring true given the mother's love of Native American spirituality, and the way she seemed more suited to the West rather than New England.Sage's story was a little more interesting, but I didn't have to waste much brainpower figuring out what was going to happen. I found myself just skimming the book towards the end. This was my first book by Luanne Rice, and might be my last."
1,Downhill,"What a huge disappointment to a loyal reader! A few years ago, I read Luanne Rice's 'Stone Heart'. After that I was hooked. I made sure I read every Luanne Rice novel I could get my hands on at the library. All were written tenderly and straight from the heart. But after 'Cloud Nine', her stories and writing continues to go downhill. She churns out novels with a cookie-cutter. You sense that she just wants to get something out. I thought I stumbled upon an author who would give me many years of wonderful reading pleasure but now I don't think so. I'm still hoping Ms. Rice will wake-up and go back to writing the way she used to. 'Dream Country' was so boring, I gave it up after a couple of chapters. I'm now on Chapter 4 of 'Firefly Beach' and it's not much better - I'm pushing myself to finish it."
3,DISAPPOINTING COUNTRY,"I have read all of Luann Rice's books, but this was the most disappointing one in terms of story and character development. I just felt that it dragged on, and the ""mystery"" is easily solved less than midway through the novel. The change of location was refreshing-away from the coastal waters of New England-but it is not enough to overcome the storyline and thin characterizations. Maybe she needs to return to Connecticut."
2,A reader,The plot line and resolution are too contrived. I believe that the narrative lags because it tends to be too verbose. I have read other works by this author that are better written.
4,One to read,"I totally enjoyed this book. It was an easy read with a good story. It is about a couple that divorced after the heartache of a missing child. Daisy can't stay where she lost her son and James will not leave because he is always keeping a watch for his return. When their daughter (who was living with Daisy) runs away across country to James, Daisy comes to wait for her daughters safe arrival. This is a touching story to show the power of faith and love."
5,a must read book for luanne rice fans,"I've never written one of these reviews before but felt I had to for this book so that other readers might give it a chance. I loved this book, and belive it to be the best book she has written so far. I was skeptical about reading this at first due to reviews that I had read. The setting of this book differs from most of Rice's books being that most of the story does not take place in New England. This book deals with love lost and found again and with how every one deals differently with the loss of loved ones. I could not put this one down and ended up reading it cover to cover in one day."
2,very disappointing,I've read several of Ms. Rice's books and this was the one I've liked the least. I'm from a large city but even I couldn't believe that calves were all taken from the cows for slaughter. The information about puppy mills is pretty accurate and very sad but wolves in Wyoming - I don't think so - probably coyettes. There were too many coincidences in this book - especially the finding of the lost child. Everything was tied up very nicely in the end - too nicely. Very predictable for the most part and extremely disappointing. If this had been the first book of her's I'd read it would also have been the last.
4,best of the presidents of the usa,best alt rock of the 90's? maybe not but its the best of the presidents!
2,Glad the hype is OVER!,"This CD is ok but doesn't draw much attention - especially after the nauseating overkill exposure it received. Hasn't anyone ever heard mindless pop before? However, ""Puffy Little Shoes"" is both pixilated and intriguing, a recherche moue of a tiny tune. But let's just say ""enough"" to the Michael Jacksons of Seattle music, ok? Thank you."
2,They can't play...and its funny,"I think, that these guys, in a very real way, really [need help]. But they [need help] enough...yes they sink to that level...that this album is enjoyable.They go a little crazy with the animal imagery and can't decide if they would rather be kids or old men but this album will get you chuckling. They really should not have made it in the ""music industry,"" but isn't that perhaps a reason to get just one album like this? If I am going to give some sort of amazing and masterful album 5 stars, I cannot give these guys better than 2 but, this album does have good qualities.This is an experience (of some sort). Worth a listen."
3,"Gump, Still In My Head","Yeah yeah, it's gump. The Presidents are a band that sound better on paper than they actually are in practice. Not exactly funny and not exactly quirky, what they really are is not real interesting. The devotion to hard Alt clichés does not help. Best tracks are `Kitty', `Boll Weevil' and the ubiquitous `Gump'. If your looking for loud, witty rock, try the Uninvited, they're about a 1000 times better than these guys."
5,good times,"I would just like to say that i am a very big fan of PUSA. I have been listening to their songs since i was 7 years old, when my cousin introduced me to them at that age their were some words on their that I wasn't supposed to listen to, but i loved the song kitty so much I would go in my room and lock the door and put the music on low so my parents couldn't hear the words. This group is just incredible! After many years i was doing an english project for school and i needed to pick my fav song, i pulled them out and now I can't stop listening to them. They are a great group and their songs seem pointless but are so funny."
4,Just 4 fun!!!,"I love this album!!! It's certainly the funniest album ever!! But what makes it so incredible is that its sense of humour is witty, tasteful, innocent yet ironic, childish and rebellious yet vain... it's quite an explosive mix!!! The lyrics are simple and so are the tunes, but one can't just help humming these songs all the time! They're so damn funny that whenever I am feeling a bit bored I just play them loud and sing along while jumping on my bed (like I did when I was a kid, a few years ago!)... that's the best of this album... it makes you smile and dance and sing, and feel like a happy little rebellious brat!!! This album is not only a celebration to music but also to all good things life has to offer!!! A true underestimated masterpiece!!"
5,Great!!!,"These guys don't even take them selves very seriously, yet they manage to sound ten times better than a lot of bands that do!!"
1,Pure Garbage,"What is this weak, drivel? These chumps think that people should pay money to listen to them screw around? In my humble opinion, it is lyrics which drive rock and roll. This band combines pointless, shallow lyrics with very mediocre music and tries to pass it off as some sort of rebellious statement. Hey guys, if you treat your music as a joke, it makes your band a joke as well!"
1,"Yep, I have to spoil the party...","Sorry to rain on the parade of 10-ratings here, but this is one of the WORST albums I have ever heard. These songs are so bad, so utterly talentless, and so IRRITATING...I just don't understand. Some of these songs are just plain offensive. Another really bad thing is that these songs are clearly meant to be funny, but where's the joke? If playing your instruments badly is meant to be funny, then I'm not laughing. If the mind-numbingly crap lyrics are meant to be funny, then I'm still not laughing. Whoever wrote the lyrics is obsessed with bugs and little animals, for some reason, which is why we get a bunch of terrible songs about insects driving buggies and fish playing guitars. Maybe I just don't understand what the Presidents are getting at. But you know what? - I really don't care."
5,"Great debut CD, the secon is even better","The best track on this CD has to be ""Kick out the Jams."" It is a must for all fun-lovin' music lovers who really want to annoy the hell out of their parents. GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW."
3,Commands in brevity,"3 1/2Straddling the line between jamming and joking is easy if, even with minimal compositional advantages, this silly and energetic hellbilly funk attempts full throttle trio synergy."
3,Stupid,OK. The tunes are absurd and very simple. But then its not pretending to be well thought out masterpiece that the artists spent months arranging and perfecting. Its a little rock 'n' roll throwaway thats a light hearted alternative not to be taken seriously because there nothing serious about it.
3,3 and a half stars for the silly trio,"I must admit, this is a very, very ridiculously silly album. Everything about the album, and the group (starting with thier name) is silly. The singer plays a guitar with only three strings for Christ's sake. Putting all the silliness aside, this album has some really great songs. It's a very fun and spontaneous album. Of course the lyrics don't say much, like ""12,000 monkeys rocking out guitars, nobody taught them how,"" or who can forget ""Millions of peaches, peaches for me. Millons of peaches, peaches for free."" Not the deepest thing you can hear, but they present these ridiculous lyrics in a very catchy, rockin way. They're like a more rockin Wierd Al. And the thing I like is how they don't take even themselves seriously singing a song called ""We're not gonna make it."" They sing ""Cause there's a million better bands with a million better songs."" Very true, but I'm still keeping this cd in my cd collection."
4,still like it,"This disk never got stuck in my cd player, but it still gets played a few years later, unlike most of my disks. It's good work music, a little predictable, but rocking along nicely. ""Naked and Famous"", near the end, is one of my favorites. Who could go wrong with a hook lyric ""making TV billboards, and green, 30 foot SMURFS""?Besides, other than ""Lump"", this disk never got wide airplay, and never will. So you won't get quite as tired of it."
5,A ROCKER OF A CD!!!!!,This is definetly better than there second cd. I have not listened to there third album but this is certainly excellent. The PUSA are a nice change to the usual songs e.g like love songs. What a great band. I mean who would write a song about peaches? Only the Presidents would!!!
1,Do not give him anymore money please!,"Don't give this thief anymore money. I am sick of ""deluxe"" editions and his books don't even deserve them. If he rewrote the book and changed the setting, plot, characters, and his writing style.....maybe but still most likely not. It sickens me people consider this good fiction. Original stories aren't getting the credit they deserve and instead we get more medicore fantasy books about Dragons and elves with pointy ears."
5,Eldest,A Great read. Perfect balance of fight sad. U will be mad at the end for 2 reasons 1 it's over. And 2 a former character comes into play and u will be mad.
5,Paolini is amazing!,This book is just amazing! There's so much extra stuff after the actual story that I still haven't made it through it all. I can't wait for Brisingr!
4,Good Book,"I read this book when it first came out, loved the series. I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. I'm waiting for the last book of the series to come out. My favorite book however out of the series is the first one. It's been awhile since I've read the series however but I do liked the idea about how Eragon and Murtagh found out there brothers. Who will win in the last book? Will they remain enemies or become friends?"
2,ouch,"It seems Mr. Paolini was just dying to SPOILER ALERT have eragon be anelf. if he wanted tohis so bad,why not just have eragon start out as one? i found the whole 'transformation' cheesey.also this also magicaly takes away all injuries. whee!! frequently,italso says eragons scar makes him a cripple.wth? the authors two dimensenol story is for the dogs.dont waste your time and money."
2,My God,"First, forget about his age. There are books just as bad or worse by adults, but now that that's out of the way, it was awful.Nothing happened except for Ajihad dying and the fight with Murtagh at the end. My God! Ok, maybe Hrothgar's death, but I find myself loving Murtagh all the more. It was all in all worse than the first.The run-on sentences have been getting worse, but at least there were less times of Eragon fainting, being knocked out, and falling asleep than that mammoth number in book one.The plagiarism is still present, and I supose that's all I have to say."
2,Would have been great if it weren't so boring and unoriginal,"I listened to the audible version of this book. While the narrator had an engaging tone, as has been previously stated by others, the book was a rip off of many others. I can't see why anybody would be blind enough to not see the plagiarism! Oh well - I don't have to let it affect me. I will not be purchasing the third book, although I probably will read the good and bad reviews so I can get a brief summary of the plot. That will probably tell me more than wandering through the banality of listening to it ever would and I will have an entire day of my life available to spend listening/doing something more worthwhile. I have nothing against the author. I hope he succeeds in developing original ideas in the future and that he does well, but so far he has not inspired my confidence."
2,I'm suprised he hasn't been sued,"I believe the title says it all the ""story"" is a bunch of re-hashes of beloved series and movies and ton of other with once again very little character developement and pretty nothing happening! I do not believe Christopher Paolini will ever be able to write original literature. But I do like against my better judgement the characters of eragon and saphira. But so many wasted pages! I will never be able to understand why he made such big books full of nothing! If he had at least made them smaller ( this coming from a girl who loves huge book) they could have gone so much farther. I will never understand the rabid fanbases for these books but at least I could somewhat like the first one (don't ask me why it just had a certain plageristic charm to it). But this jut went downhill from that. Overall I would not recomend this series because 5 pages in you will know exactly how it ends."
2,Almost painful,I only gave two stars because he must read Mercedes Lackey novels too. The first book was read as said before drawn out and I kept catching myself being drawn to other novel's scenes. That is disruptive to the flow of the read.
1,Amazon has this all jacked up - the wrong episode plays,and then they tell you they don't typically refund digital orders as if it's somehow my fault I selected an episode I was willing to pay only for something else to play. They did provide credit but be aware they are clearly in no rush to correct the issue that others will clearly experience until they do!
4,Enjoyed it,"I don't think it was quite as good as some of the others shows I have watched. Loved that program, sorry to see it went off the air."
5,Hilarious Episode. Great show.,One of the best episodes ever created for this show! I laughed the whole way through! Will watch this episode every Holiday season for years to come!
5,Good brand,I love Solaray. They are a dependable brand. I take Turmeric regularly. There are no side effects. Would buy again!
4,I really want to like it.,"When I first ordered this product, I was really excited about how well I thought this product would work. However, after several weeks of taking one capsule per day, I didn't really notice a huge difference. Some of my acne had cleared up a little bit, but not to the extent that I expected to see. I continued to get new breakouts, so I wasn't extremely impressed. Although, any improvement is a good thing, and mine is pretty bad. Perhaps it will work better for other people.My other main issue with this product is the way that the capsules are packaged. They're just little clear capsules around Tumeric powder, and they don't appear to be very secure. My entire bottle has a thin layer of powder on the inside, so it looks like some has been escaping."
3,ALL SCREWED UP,"I have 20,000 cds and I have 20 or 30 cds that have songs listed in the wrong order on the back tray card and in the booklet. This cd sets the world record for errors. Not one song title out of 31 is in the right order. NOT ONE!!!! And it's not that they are just one track off, Track #1 is actually track #28, track #2 is actually #29, track #3 is actually track #1, track #17 is actually track #11 etc.etc.etc. How can this happen!!! Thanks to Amazon for listing the songs in their proper order. I see Rev-ola is probably out of business, so I guess this will not be corrected anytime soon. H-bomb deserves better than this."
3,Wynnonie wantabee,"After a few good songs, you realize that it all sounds the same. Sounds like Wynnonie Harris was his idol. Did not have the talent or vocal range."
5,Awesome,"I like this cd 'cause it is a perfect mix between cuban and other latin rythms. Also, the lyrics talk about love and hope."
5,Very dark but very good.,"If you are looking for a novel that slams you in your face with what the ideals of society place in our easily modified brains, read this novel. If you want to have a nice, breezy read in the summer afternoon, look elsewhere. Palahniuk does not sugar coat his views on modern society. The characters in this novel all have some form of self-inflicted wound as a result of the world's idealism."
2,and I thought American Pyscho was weird...,"I love the writing style, but the story is simply to freaky to be enjoyable. I think Survivor is the best book of the lot."
3,Boredom through bizarreness,"This is my first literary jaunt through the mind of Palahniuk. I saw the movie Fight Club and was compelled to pick up one of his books. I chose Invisible Monsters because of the subject. How can you go wrong with a super model who gets her face blown off? I have to say that there were parts that made me laugh out loud. But those parts were so sparingly imbedded in this over the top, completely out there, novel that I eventually burned out on the bizarre factor and became bored. Being able to see the plot ‘twists’ from miles away didn’t help. There was absolutely not one character to like, respect or root for in the entire book. Everyone .... equally. I guess that was the point. I’m not easily shocked, and Palahniuk, try as he might, didn’t succeed. I give the book three stars for the Christmas chapter and for Shannon’s one brilliant and hilarious act of revenge. Worth reading? Sure, but you might want to pick up something by Harry Crews instead."
5,"One of, if not, his best!","For me, this book and Fight Club are my personal favorite of Chuck's. I still think that Fight Club is not everybody's favorite because the movie was so popular and well known that liking Fight Club is not 'cult-ish'. The rest of his works I like to a certain level except Diary which is kinda boring to me.Well, you can read most of the brief story plot from the others but I will say this much: A novel about lost-control models is not my idea of good novel but it turned out that I love the story and I actually found all of the the main characters, except Evie, charming (albeit in very weird ways).Enough said, this is an excellent and mildly disturbing piece of art. If you like Fight Club then this will surely not dissapoint you. Page-turner and full of twists and turn this one is!"
5,Great book~,"This is one of my new favorites- I even bought a copy as a gift for some one, must read if you haven't."
4,Chuck knows how to write,"Very exciting, twisting read. Has a certain quality found in Fight Club to it. Palahniuk exhibits his unique style throughout this piece"
3,A bit weird,"My son got this book for a high school lit class. He needed help with a paper, so I read the book. Hard to recommend it to just anyone. It was interesting to me, but I don't think everyone would enjoy it."
5,Please Read this Book,"Invisible Monsters is a very, very good book that delves deeply into the world of beauty and it's effect. It is your typical twisted yet undoubtedly exciting Palahniuk joy-ride that I actually just finished today, and loved. Though nothing IMO beats his Fight Club, Invisible Monsters is very well worth your time."
5,"Offbeat, charming, frustrating, and altogether unique.","As a huge fan of Fight Club, I was anxious to get my hands on this book. I was not disappointed. The central characters are as uniquely original as those in Fight Club, and in my opinion, Palahniuk has sharpened his storytelling ability to a dizzyingly sharp point. And for those of you who loved the twists Palahniuk took in Fight Club - have no worries. There are enough twists in this novel that you'll have whiplash and crossed eyes by the time you finish. I very eagerly await more books from Palahniuk. What a genius!"
3,"Not quite Fight Club or Survivor, but good","For a Chuck P. primer, check out one of his first two novels. Then, perhaps, move along to this one which is engaging but not quite on the same level as the previous two (especially Survivor.) Some of his writing devices will be very familiar (perhaps to the point of becoming cliche) and one is left wondering if the book was rushed to capitalize on the movie release of Fight Club (you think?) Regardless, Chuck manages to come up with a fresh set of darkly humorous oddballs and send them on another existential, out-of-control exploration of a hopelessly superficial, consumer culture that created them."
3,"A fun read, but not as affecting as Palahniuk's earlier work","Invisible Monsters had its moments. The characters were for the most part interesting, and the work is always witty and engaging... until the end. The ""final"" standing relationships of the characters feel extremely forced, like Palahniuk had to fabricate incredulous relationships between characters in order to validate his creating the characters themselves. However, I must say that the one thing I truly loved in the book were Shannon and Shane's parents and how happy they were at finally being ""hate-crimed."" People like this, who hypocritically turn their losses into their conceit, are so hilarious. In short, and fun read, but that's about all it is."
3,IT was o.k.,"This is the first book by Chuck that I have read and I wasn't sure what to think. The book was interesting and annoying at the same time as plot twists showed that no one is who/what they seem. *shrug* Not the worst book I've ever read, not the best. But it was ""good enough"", I guess, since I'm now reading Fight Club."
1,MTV does books,"This book was handed to me by a friend who I can only descibe as hopelessly urban-cool. Palahniuk's novel is catered to short attention spans, and its no surprise to me that his other novel was made into a movie. I think the author's hope is that if he throws enough edgy disjointed bursts into a book, the juxtaposition will make it clever. Is this where fiction is now? There was so little honesty in the writing, not one element I could identify with. At least with Douglas Coupland there is a sence of tapping into history (even if the nostalgia is dripping with sarcasm). Skip this one. Or just stay tuned for the music video."
1,good for what its worth,"This novel is the weakest of all Palahniuk's novels. I liked the whole transgender cover-up thing, and how most of the characters were not as they seemed. I thought this novel was the most nihilistic of Chuck's novels just because it deals with the subject so directly. I favor Chuck's satirical books more, especially his first ""horror"" novel- Lullaby. For first time readers, pick up Choke and then proceed to Survivor, Fight Club, and then this novel."
2,"...though ""invisible monsters"" does contain its witty moments...","...though ""invisible monsters"" does contain its witty moments, it strongly resembles the anti-corporate, chopped up style of ""fight club"" and ""choke"". in the end, i'd rather jump off a building than read this book again."
2,Palahnuk too fast for me.,"I don't like criticizing Chuck because I reallyenjoyed a few of his novels (Fight Club beingone of them). But Invisible Monsters is justso... so out there! In a bad way, I mean. OK,his social commentary is excellent and his styleis unique(whatever that means), but the guy writeslike a foot soldier under heavy fire! Maybe...maybe I'm the guy who's a little slow. But likeI said, the guy's too fast for me."
3,About as entertaining as bad books get.,"Palahniuk's third novel is easily his worst. No one disputes it (not that nobody likes it; it has it's fans). It starts out with a huge bang and never quiets down. It's never boring and oftentimes great. It's problem is the story. There isn't much plot. Basically just a bunch of twists (there are many more twists than in Fight Club, and they're just as surprising, but they're not nearly as good, some of them work against it this time) and a lot of characterization spliced up quite well. It works best when there isn't a plot, just a tight situation and a few good characters. Like always, Palahniuk has a message, but you've heard this one all before (though I'm sure a little less twisted). Palahniuk's sense of humor is still in tip-top shape. So that's good. All in all this is a very mixed book. I'd call it bad before I call it good, but I'll give it three stars because this is an interesting failure."
2,All style and no substance,"Reading this book was mostly a bore. It was easy to read, but now that I've finished I wish I had read a more exciting story with more substance. The writing style is annoying because it jumps back and forth every page. Palahniuk has his own explanation as to why he wrote it this way, but it seems like it's just so he can throw whatever he wants to in there. Practically the whole book is you wondering what the frick is going on and then at the end Chuck just throws in a few *gasp* shockers. These shockers are nothing on par with Fight Club's. It's just like Chuck writing whatever came to his mind that day and then being like, ""well, this is around 230 pages so I'd better wrap it up now"". He just throws whatever he wants in there at that point. Such a pointless read."
4,A personal favorite,"After I watched Fight Club, I read the book. After I read the book, I read Invisible Monsters. Both are favorites, but, perhaps, because I have a slight familiarity of Palahniuk's style, I found all of the plot twists in this story unsurprising, some even predictable. Because of that I gave this book four stars instead of five.The characters in the story are all vivid and believable. The setting work is pleasantly minimalistic unless the particular moment in the plot warrants otherwise. The plot itself is somehow meandering but also driven. If I were to give it one more adjective, it'd be ""gritty""."
4,Initial offering from the master,"When Kurt Vonnegut sadly passed away, there was a feeling that perhaps satire had died within the modern American lexicon. ""Invisible Monsters"" is here to prove doubters wrong and in a big way. Shannon McFarland is the girl everyone knows. The pretty (but not crazy pretty) girl in high school who has aspirations (but not huge aspirations) and an untapped sexual potency that is both highly attractive and innocent at the same time. She rebukes the world created by her model friends and (without spoiling the twist), creates her own Hell in which she thrives quite well. The book is without a plot, as most of Chuck's novels are, but when you dig this far into the character and you find how much you relate to them and how much they don't relate to the world around them, a plot is the last thing you need."
4,Loved it!,One of his better books. Great build up and suspense regarding what is going on with an awesome ending to finish it off. Highly recommend.
4,"Dark, and creepy..but such a grand read.","I fully enjoyed this book. His writings are filled with interesting descriptions that really make his style so wonderful. It is dark, and creepy,but that's what makes this book so great."
3,A little too surreal?,"I just finished reading this book yesterday after setting it down for a month. I enjoyed this book alot until I got somewhere near the end and things got so coincidential. I just think it went way over the edge, and there is nothing wrong with that- its just not my taste. If you are a Palahniuk fan I think you will really enjoy reading this book or at least the majority of it... but if you have never read any of his books try Fight Club or Survivor first!"
3,"Great writing, a little too easy at times though","This book is written in a wonderful fashion. I love the characters, the narrative, and the art of it all. My only problem is that, at times, the author seems to take the easy way out in terms of plot. I don't want to give anything away, but this book seems to have much of the Fight Club formula. I think that's where my problems with this book arose, I felt like I had been there before and seen it before.I will say this, however, he does a great job writing about people on the edge. I would pick this book up and read it, its entertaining."
4,Visible Talent,"First, I'll start off by saying 'Invisible Monsters' is my first Chuck Palahniuk book. Invisible Monsters isn't what you'd expect, to say the least... It's about a 'paid programming' model who gets severely disfigured in an car 'accident', and it leaves her depressed, and much more pensive than her old petty little worries. I don't wanna spoil anything, so I'll just say that its one of those 'expect the unexpected' books."
3,Tyler Durden Feminized,"Invisible Monsters is engaging and fast moving from the very first page. Palahniuk writes with schizophrenic brilliance, pulling the reader in several directions with a blink of an eye. The style is fresh and unorthodox. What Bret Easton Ellis has attempted, Palahniuk has achieved. However, we aren't seeing anything new from chuck here. Brandy Alexander, who stresses that the only way to reinvent oneself is to make questionable decisions, seems a little too much like Tyler Durden of fight club. ('self improvement is masturbation') Basically, palahniuk has delivered the same message as his previous novel with less engaging characters. If its vintage palahniuk you're looking for, read fight club instead."
2,Disappointing...,"After Fight Club, I was pretty damn excited to get my hands on this book. However, my joy was short-lived. Like other reviewers, I found the characters, and the plot to be formulaic. The only reason I stuck with it to the end, was because I refused to believe the book could be that dull throughout. I was wrong.Instead of allowing me to escape from the drudgery of my bar job, this book actually made me want to get back to work. My employer wishes to thank you, Mr Palahniuk."
4,Fast and Hard,"While not as themeatically important as ""Fight Club"" or ""Survivor,"" ""Invisible Monsters"" is a fast read with plot twists that rival ""Fight Club"". The story follows an ex-fashion model (who's jaw got blown off and can no longer speak), a transvestite, and a estrogen fueled male model on a cross-country road trip to stop the wedding of another model. Although this is billed as Palahnuik's 3rd novel, it's actually the first one he wrote. Publishers rejected ""Invisible Monsters"" for being too disturbing. These same publishing companies later accepted ""Fight Club"". Maybe that will give you some sort of idea on how jacked up this novel is."
4,Bizarre journey through fashion and disfigurement,"Most readers will instantly either love or hate this novel. To best determine which group you fall into, realize that this book was written by the author of Fight Club. You will likely feel the same about this book as you did about the movie based upon that book.In my case, I liked it quite a bit. The characters are as extreme as the plot. It is meant that way. The plot jumps back and forth and around, often confusingly. Again, this is a device. These devices are effective and done well, but many readers will be turned off by it. More than anything, this is an examination of the nature of fame, beauty, self-esteem, and desensitization to all of it. This is a book that has a point and it makes it effectively.I will probably not become a huge reader of Chuck Palahniuk because I think he is somewhat fixed on style over substance, but I do recommend this book."
4,Emily - PR,"Kay McIsaac, fashion model, is both irritated (because her fashion model best friend Evie Cottrell stole her boyfriend) and anonymous (she wears veils because half of her face was shot away by a freak accident). She's an ""invisible monster."" But her life takes an upswing when Brandy Alexander, a transsexual one last step of surgery away from becoming an entire woman, brings excitement and money back into Kay's life. They plan revenge on Evie, kidnap Kay's two-timing fiance Manus, and go from state to state, entering huge homes that are open for sale and rifling the bathrooms for drugs they can take in large quantities. This is a very odd and amusing book, with much witty and pointed commentary on the subjects of beauty and cosmetic surgery. It also has more plot twists than the average reader can follow."
5,Bizarre is an Understatement!,"Someone has blown the face off a beautiful model as she is driving on the expressway! Whodunnit? This question is almost ignored throughout this really weird and hilariously offbeat take on contemporary USA, its hidden and revealed horrors and pathos, its commercialized culture and highways, and its plain strangeness. Along this path, we meet individuals who may or may not be transgendered, all-American families with really off the wall Christmas celebrations.Think contraceptives in the stockings to Perry Como crooning Christmas carols. How to get drugs fairly easily, and name changes to match the current predicament. Like reading on high octane jumping back and forth through terrain best described as odd!"
4,Beauty Obsessed Society,"Palanhiuk takes us on a psychological journey of a former beauty model who has been transfigured into a demorphed alien. The effects and reactions of one's perception of oneself based on societies perceptions of another person's beauty and looks is greatly profiled here. In addition, the increasingly gluttonous consumer centered nature of our society and it's everlasting drive more more perfection, more beauty, usually by artificially enhanced means, and more dominance, power, and class, is lovingly, as well as sickengly portrayed here. Well worth the read concerning our fashionista oriented consumption."
4,Simply wow!,"Granted, the first pages of the novel are hard to read (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). But if you can hang on, you will be in for a hell of a ride, and at some point you wish you could read faster so all the secrets would be revealed at once.Palahniuk at its best"
3,An Okay Read,"Invisible Monsters is an okay book, nothing too special about it. Its saving grace is its ending, which is unique to Palahniuk's style. The fact that I don't have much to say about this book is a tell tale in itself because it didn't evoke enough of a reaction, either for or against, to create a lasting memory.Palahniuk is a good writer and can tell a story, which is a huge plus, but the storyline in this one didn't really amount to much. So, not bad, but not good either."
5,Brandy Alexander is my new Supreme Being,"This novel changed my vacation and my world! This book is written so poetically that it comes off as almost lyrical. The twists will hit you like a freight train. The look readers are given into the mind of this psychological car-wreck of a girl makes us feel both sane and entirely crazy. She's so twisted we feel normal by comparison, until she comes out with something totally warped, and we secretly agree.Brandy Alexander, one of the other main characters, is my new Supreme Being.Get ready for a ride, you won't be able to put this book down."
4,Oddly Entertaining!,"Ordinarily I'm tough on poor usage of the English language (or any language for that matter) but it was obviously intentional in Chuck's writing.He has a ""stream of consciousness"" sense of humor that I enjoy.The story is decidedly odd but I tend to like ideas that don't conform to the norm!Rave on Chuckles!!!"
4,Fight Club Loses Decision,"Personally, I feel Invisible Monsters to be the better of the first two Palahniuk books despite the hype generated by the film. This is Palahniuk taking on three extremely complex, yet tri-polar characters, and making it all work extremely well against an ever-changing backdrop. It may have it's small gaps and a few questions to answer (as did Fight Club) but we must give the man credit... he's only began writing since 1993!"
4,Be the detective with this one!,"This book for Chuck was drawn out. I read a review where it said the middle hundred pages can be dropped. Well I believe pages 150 - 200 could be thrown out. It is still a great novel but, there it some repetiveness with these pages.It is predictible but, he does have the natural twist at the end that no one would figure out. I recommend this book to any one who liked any of his other novel because of the way it is written. It has flashbacks and flash forwards. It keeps you focused on detail and you feel as though you are the detective trying to solve the case.Read it to solve the mystery!"
1,Ridiculous,"With each passing book, Palahniuk gets even stupider. He doesn't seem to be able to make his far-out premises work anymore, and this novel proves nothing but an embarassment to read."
1,Jump way back to my regretting the purchase of this book,"I bought this book before i realized how much i despise Palahniuk, so forgive me.The premise seemed decent, but of course, being Captain Submediocrity, the potential was never met.The whole non-linear story telling is great, sometimes amazing, but not when he does it. It's choppy, forced, and overall monotonous.This book is basically for the ugly kids who want to see a beautiful woman torn to shreds, because that's, like, so ironic and stuff."
4,Much was explained...,"When I found out this was the first book Palahniuk ever wrote (although it's the third to be published.) It certainly has the major Palahniuk theme; the two extremes, in this case of attention, either everybody loves you or no one will look at you. Duality also plays a role.When I first read this, I thought Palahniuk was slipping a bit; ""Fight Club"" is a classic and ""Survivor"" is pretty close. It's not quite as strong as those two, but since it's his first, that can easily be overlooked.If you go for darkly humorous fiction with a lot of potential shock value, this is the book for you."
4,"I don't know what just happened, but I like it","The way that Palahniuk sets things up seemingly at random right before your eyes without you realizing it is amazing. Then, when you think you're already lost, he sets the events off, one after another, until theres nothing left but this strange look on your face, and you're left saying: I need more.Read Invisible Monsters and you'll never stop wondering.Read Survivor and you'll never stop laughing.Read Choke and you'll never stop thinking.Palahniuk is the lunatic that we need right now."
3,Okay.,I am a reader by nature and I found this book extremely hard to get into. Once I did the twists and turns of the novel were mind-blowing. I would give it about a 70% on its attention holding capabilities.
3,ok,"invisible monsters is about a model who has an accident and is forced to wear a veil as a result of her disfigurement.she meets a drag queen who takes her on the road to spiritually find themselves.While traveling across the states,they stop at houses on sale to steal the medication from the medicine cabinets.at times the book is confusing but that's what to expect from the author of ""fight club"".there are a lot of plot twists and the story is very unpredictable.not for everybody but worth exploring."
3,Came Damaged,Book arrived within the estimated dates but has a cut on the back cover which cuts into a couple of the last pages of the book.
3,Not quite up to par,"I've now read Palahniuk's first three novels. I thoroughly enjoyed fight club and survivor but i felt that Invisible Monsters lacked the same gripping social awareness as the others. It was very funny and had some odd twists and turns, but just not quite there..."
5,Hitting bottom,"A popular them in all of Chuck Palahniuk's book. The idea that in order to move beyond society we must hit bottom and do exactly what we are not suppossed to. Whether or not this actully works for anyone (Chuck's characters included) - it's hard to tell. This book in particular uses elements of the fashion world and the famous. A product to the core, the narrator finds herself in search of a personal identity, beyond society and labels, but first she must confront tragety and sacrifice, she must do what she doesn't want..."
2,OUCH!,"... ok, this book might have been good... had it been told in some type of order... but as specified in the first few pages, it was going to be told like a fashion magazine, where everything kept getting switched and there was no chronological sense... this ruined the book for me, because it just ended up giving me a headache... sure there are the funny one liners Chuck Palahniuk's great at, but... the overall story just wasnt very involving... I've read all of his books, and this one is by far the worst... don't pick this one up till you've gotten all of the others."
2,Read his other work instead,I was a fan of both fight club and survivor (the latter more so) and was looking forward to this read. Howver I was greatly dissapointed. I was also unimpressed with Choke (I have yet to read his most recent). I just get the impression that Chuck is trying too hard. Maybe his time has passed.
1,"Too Many Tricks, Too Little Writing","In the immortal words of Sgt. Hulka, Settle down, Francis. While Fight Club made me laugh and feel immense paranoia at the same time, I think Chuck has taken to creating tricks vs. writing real stories. This is, in short, nothing less than a piece of paper put out to coincide with what will certainly be Fight Club mania as soon as the movie comes out. And good for Chuck. At least he's making money. Avoid this one and just read Fight Club again."
4,A Must Read,Amazing novel...in sync with his stunning collection of original and impressive novels. You have to read!
5,Simply the best.,"I've been disappointed by the disappointment that other fans of Palahniuk have displayed about this novel, and often can't believe the things that I've heard. Invisible Monsters is without a doubt my favourite novel. I found that I could relate easily to the characters (though one must wonder what that says about me), and that the words written there have stuck with me for years. I've often used Invisible Monsters to create new Palahniuk fans in my friends. Though it's unmistakably different than Fight Club, which is what most people think of when they think of Chuck, I've always felt that Invisible Monsters helped me understand Palahnuik's train of thought better.In any case, anyone who loves Chuck simply must read it, even if they don't appreciate it. I swear that once you get into it, you never come back out."
4,Invisible Monsters? Or merely monsters in drag? You decide,"This is the first novel that I've read by Chuck Palahniuk. I've seen ""Fight Club,"" the movie, but not had the opportunity to read Chuck's own words. His writing style is quite unique is very conversational, which makes for a quick, easy, and enjoyable read. And his twisted sense of humor definitely shines through his writing. However, I think this book is better for its parts than as a whole. The first chapter was EXCELLENT, but unfortunately, it's no indication of the quality of the rest of the book, in my opinion. The only other chapter which could possibly compete was one involving conversation around the dinner table with the main character's parents. This chapter could definitely stand alone as a short story. A very humorous, twisted short story.Would I recommend ""Invisible Monsters"" to a friend? Probably. If only for those two chapters. If only the rest of the book was as entertaining..."
3,Not My Favorite Palahniuk,"I'd read all of Palahniuk's other novels, but missed this one somewhere along the way. I like his biting style and the general tortured weirdness of his characters. He always surprises me. However, that's exactly what I felt was missing from this book. I really knew where everything was going in terms of the relationships between the characters. What's more, I was left with a general feeling of ""Who cares?"" I don't think that Palahniuk ever really us asks to sympathize with his characters, but I honestly felt nothing for Shannon, and she didn't act anything like any women I know. She's an eccentric stock character--and though that may be the point--I don't have to enjoy it. I don't have to like a main character, but I want to care about what happens to her. On the plus side, the book does have its very funny moments and wicked satire. I'd recommend this book to Palahniuk lovers, but it's not my favorite."
2,Not the best Palahniuk,"I was quite bored with Invisible Monsters and I was a little dissapointed in Palahniuk,although there are some excellent funny moments in this book. Survivor and Fight Club are much better reads with more solid storylines and better characters."
2,Visible Disapointment,"Palahniuk starts his third novel with the same structure as his two previous works, and, for someone who adored the first two books, this felt a little like Palahniuk had found a formula for writing a novel and thus decided to stick to it rigidly. Elements of the novel are good, there are some hysterical set-pieces (the best one being around the dinner table with the narrator and her parents), but otherwise the rest of the novel fell too easily into the same sort of pattern that 'Survivor' and 'Fight Club' developed. The predictability of the narrative also tends to annoy, and because my hopes for a third consecutive brilliant novel were so high, this novel really left me feeling a little cold. Thankfully, Palahniuk's forth novel (which I finished last week) is a masterful return to form."
3,Blandish Bee Gees,"""Mr. Natural"" follows in the tradition of previous Bee Gees albums since ""Two Years On""; nice but variable in quality. Unfortunately on this album there is a revisit of the bland MOR/country styled pop of the dreadful ""Cucumber Castle"" period, along with a few hints at what was to come with the next LP and the disco era. The title track is definitely the best of the lot here. It is excellent. ""Heavy Breathing"" and ""Had A Lot of Love Last Night"" are two more noteworthy tracks, but this album overall is something of a snorer compared to their art-rock masterpieces of the late '60s."
5,Diamond in the Rough,"I would put this album in my top 5 Bee Gees favorites. Maybe it's because some of their other albums were overplayed (like Children of the World). But I can't stop listening to Mr. Natural. This is as much of a transition album as Main Course. And really for a Bee Gees fan, Main Course only makes sense if you know Mr. Natural. While this got panned by their record company, it is not because it doesn't have great music. I would argue that it just doesn't ""fit"" anywhere--R&B, country, rock. That's what I love about it."
1,This book is just bizarre,"This book is organized in a very odd fashion. It's like a long, long, 237-page list of bullet points. It's divided into chapters, but while Barash is good at setting up lots of horrendous possible situations, she never provides suggestions, advice or solutions. That is, there are suggestions, but they're just one-liners that don't really make sense.In addition, there's a completely weird paragraph at the beginning of Chapter 3 that just turned me off to the whole book. I won't type out the whole thing, I'll just paraphrase: A woman is jealous of her husband's ex-wife. She starts following him around, and sure enough, he's meeting her at a hotel. Then she said ""My uncertainty was the demise of our marriage."" Whuh? Nooo. She caught her husband cheating, and HER UNCERTAINTY was the problem? This author must listen to a lot of Dr. Laura if that's how she thinks it works!I wish I could return this book. I hate it."
4,This book was very helpful,"It doesn't look like there are any other reviewers who really have dealt with the problems of being a second wife. I thought Susan covered all the bases pretty well. I have been a second wife for five years, to a man still dealing with the hang-ups of that failed relationship. I came to our relationship fresh and ready to make a life with this man, but found myself in a triangle instead - the other woman simply (still) refuses to move on - and feeling helpless. Ms. Barash's book gave me the insights I needed to save my relationship. She helped me focus on US, get my mind out of the rut it had fallen into, by simply validating the many fears and problems, but more - by helping me focus on the REWARDS. She made me see I was actually feeding the problems with my unrealistic expectations, rather than dealing with reality. Thank you, Ms. Barash - your book empowered me. You helped me get that nasty thorn out of my side."
2,What do you espect from nike,It's very poor watch. It has a horrible red button (and they don't show it in the picture). It looks nicer in the website.
5,Very original interesting music,"I heard about this band when I recently became interested in the steampunk genre of fiction, art, fashion, etc. Sometimes bands that cater to a certain group or spend a lot of effort trying to fit a certain mold end up not making very good music. Abney park however makes some really great music regarless of what they look like. It's kind of a unique mix of trance beats with interesting guitar, violin, and keyboard melodies. Many of the songs sound very unique and original, but they still have that catchiness that will make them stick in your head all day.The fact that they are very into steampunk culture is just a bonus (or minus depending on your preferences) that make them interesting to watch while listening."
2,Written for Kindegarteners,"And about as useful as a coloring book. ""Take Charge of Your Workers' Compensation Claim"" by Christopher A. Ball is a much better book with lot's of information and helpful worksheets etc. I suppose if this is the only book you can find, it might be a little helpful. Unfortunately, there are no pearls of wisdom here. Sorry Ava. The text is very simple, the content is barely more than what common sense will tell you. As I mentioned, there are other books that really have great info. I appreciate the sentiment here, but the author ought to look at competitive books and write a new edition with some meat."
2,I found it irritating,"Its pretty rare that I don't finish a book, unfortunately this was one of those cases. If I missed anything like a dramatic change in prose style (I stopped halfway through the book) then I apologise.I found the positioning of 'Ambient' to be (as other reviewers have mentioned) an attempt at lying somewhere between cyberpunk and Burgess's classic Clockwork Orange. However in terms of actual implementation, the prose irritated me beyond all belief. The characters speak like drunken yodas. Don't get me wrong I'm fully in favour of taking dialects to the extreme to make a point in literature (Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh being an exemplary example) but I found page after page of this annoying doublespeak too much to bear.When other reviewers say ""this is a hard book to read"" they are damn right. For me the return on investment wasn't worth it."
5,When stars were stars,"Moguls & Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood is an enthralling compilation of the birth of the American film industry. The birth of Hollywood was humble and almost temporary, early one reelers, hastily produced on low burgets and tossed aside. The collection profiles the creation of the studio system and the powerful businessmen who evolved into ""Demi-Gods of film"", solidifying films place in the modern age and art history. These men; Mayer, Selznick,The Warner brothers and more, transformed orange groves into the billion dollar industry we have today. They controlled the stars careers and personal lives, making and breaking those who displeased them. I found it difficult to walk away without watching it in one sitting! For the true classic film fan, this is a must have, offering insight into the Golden Age of Hollywoodland!"
5,Movies and Moguls,"This is an outstanding history of the movie business, from the rough and tumble, humble beginnings to the polished corporate world of today; highly recommended."
3,Disappointing Menu Management,"This is a wonderful series. It is interesting, entertaining, and fun to watch, but the menu design is tedious and annoying. There are 2 - 3 episodes on each disc but in order to advance to the next episode, you actually have to turn the machine off and turn it back on in order to get to the menu that allows you to choose which episode you want to view. This means you have to watch all of the beginning time suckage over and over again. If given the choice - I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Bloodfest,"OK...This was a blood filled, violent anger ridden, splatterfest kind of Book. I loved it. I thought the dialog was a little juvenile and dumbed down at first...and then the blood started to flow. Mr. Thomas has a sick mind. I think he may have practiced some of this on his neighbors before he wrote it. It just seemed like he knew what he was writing about all too well!"
3,NOT drm free!,"A little warning:This book is NOT drm free even though it says ""Simultaneous Device Usage: Unlimited"", so dont buy this if you want to use it on other ebook readers than Kindle."
5,Misery on Steroids,"I really enjoyed this book. Reading some reviews I was expecting a pure gore fest, but what I found was a story that was a page-turning suspense thriller that I just couldn't put down. I don't think I took more than 3 breaths while reading the last 50 pages. Disturbing? Yes. Horrifying? Yes. Entertaining? Absolutely yes."
5,Highly Recommended,"I want to preface this review by saying that I had never heard of the author, or really read into this genre before. I came by this title due to a friend recommending it, and she was quite adamant I not wait to read it. After finishing it start to finish in one sitting I can see why. The brutal realism spoke to how tragedy can strike at any time, and how an ordinary day can turn into a nightmare. The characterization was especially well done, and in the beginning I was easily able to slip into the characters shoes, whether because of shared love of geeky pursuits, or the adversarial relationship with a younger sister. Things like that made this book come alive, and stick in my mind. It's definitely one I'll recommend to my friends, and hope to be forgiven if they are a tad squeamish."
5,What a great book!!,"Loved this book, it was gruesome as the story unfolded, it reminded me a lot of the style of Jack Ketchum who I am a big fan. i really felt i got to know The character Roger and how he felt through all the torture. The only part that freaked me out was the last line! CREEPY!!! If you don't mind some blood and guts you'll enjoy this book!!!"
4,It can always get worse,"I can't remember the last time I read a book cover to cover in one sitting before, especially starting at 9:00 at night, but this book had me drawn in from the start.It starts of nice enough, lulling you into a false sense of security by dealing with the sort of thing that we can all relate to: going back home after a long absence and catching up with an old friend.Then, with one simple line describing the sound of someone screaming in the woods, the glass shatters and you're sucked through the rest of the book at a mind numbing pace.This book was very well written, very disturbing, and if you think you've got the stomach for it, I can't recommend it enough."
2,Difficult to read,"The two of us tried to read this book but none of us has finished yet. Quite boring to be honest and the repetitions make it difficult to understand. I think that the writer has a point but he was not able to translate it into words. As a lot of books nowadays it is so full of repetitions that after a while one doesn't even know what the goal of the book is. Saying the same thing over an dover again is not a good way to keep people interested till the end of the book. Sorry, I can't recommend it!"
3,An abyss of information,"The other reviewer was correct in saying this book goes to deep into how exchange 2003 works. The information presented in this book would be helpful to an engineer upgrading thousands of computers. Small to midsize businesses are not represented in this book. This book is good for reference only, do not buy this if you need a step by step guide for a small or midsize migration. Use the microsoft help, you will get more use out of it than this book."
5,THE UNIQUE,"We are very lucky to live in the same time with Nikolaos Ioannidis.He is a unique artist.He managed to combinate modern problems of human life and human feelings with the most beautiful music which reminds us the whole history of music.In addition,the womens' voices are so beautiful so that they give us the feeling of peace."
5,This is an outstanding textbook,"This book is pedagogically one of the best texts I've readon any subject. It is an excellent, clear overview of the field,together with many interesting tidbits and insights intoour own (English)language. The explanations of how to makeunfamiliar sounds is clear enough that I could understandeven without a recording. The author supports his viewpointswith acoustic research without getting bogged down. Highlyrecommended."
4,Interesting,"This book is very interesting, I am reading it for now, then I will go through every chapter and put to use the speech rules there and looking forward to improving my pronunciation. So far, I like what I am reading... Many years go, when I was taking classes to become an interpreter/translator we had to take a mandatory Phonetics Class, our instructor was great, made the learning of sounds easy. I am sure this book will take me a long way with phonetics..."
2,Good? Not so much.,"The author of this book spent part of his career in the British Isles and part in the United States, and it shows. Unless you plan to practice speech pathology in Scotland, I would skip this one. The best approach to a beginning phonetics class is to learn the basic phonemes in terms of their transcription and placement. This book, however, introduces phonemes with lesser-used (at least in the U. S.) symbols and unhelpful references. The inclusion of European examples is especially confusing."
2,too dreamy,"I was so excited to get this book, because I love the dance form Authentic Movement and this book is all about its founder using it for her own healing. But the book is written almost like a dream sequence, and I can't figure out what the author was learning during her process, or what it all means. I found the book a bit dark and confusing. I wouldn't mind dark if I could understand the insights the author got from moving through it. But I couldn't."
2,not at all what I thought it was,"I was experiencing a very scary kundalini spiritual emergency in which I would go into a trance and by body wanted to do spontaneous backbends. I thought this was a book of someone having a similar experience. If it was I couldnt tell. It appears it IS a woman's spiritual journey...and a large part of her experiences are visions which she describes. I won't say it's a bad book, but for me it was more like reading poetry and I did not find it at all helpful. I am currently cash challenged, so I have to say I regret buying it."
5,Next best thing to being there.,I have been to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City twice in as many years. It is a captivating place. This film brings that same feeling into your home. Highly informative and superbly done. A must see.
4,Good piece of history,Good piece of history. Wish there were more than 30 minutes to the video. Very educational and poignant. Everyone should watch it. A piece of history.
2,Really average,"I don't understand what everyone sees in this album. I have listened to a lot of metal and this does absolutely nothing for me. Maybe it's the production - all the sounds are smoothed over so much that there is no punch to the guitar, or anything other than Doro Pesch's voice. All We Are is pretty good, but everything else reeks of generic 80's metal - from songs about metal (""Metal Tango"") to lyrics likeI have no mercyI tell no liesI kiss the strangersAnd then watch them die(""Kiss Of Death"")there are a lot better 80's metal albums for your money's worth. If you are a fan of old-school metal or hair metal, and don't mind elements of the other in your music, then give it a listen. Otherwise, pick up something like Powerslave or British Steel for some good 80's metal."
1,If you like All We Are...,"Save some money and download it as a single track somewhere. Don't waste your money and time on the rest of the album. There's a reason that's the only song anyone even remotely remembers from this group.Doro seems to have made it her mission to come off as super-bad biker chick who can hang with the Boys, like a younger Lita Ford with less pop. Problem is, even Lita can sing better than her, and that's not saying much for Lita."
1,1 Star for Dora Peach,Hey people I read all your reviews and you forget to mention the very talented work of Mr. Tommy Bolan who really made this album what it was. Dora after not being able to handle the credit to Mr. Bolan promply fired him after the European tour and she sunk like the hag (HACK) she truly was.People think about it Warlock was nothing before T and A and was nothing after.Thank You
5,one of Warlocks best album,Doro's voice is so powerful on 3 minute warning and all we are.The video for the later is brilliant as wel.lThe album cover is great as well
2,there worst with richie,"The only reason i gave this a 2 stars is for respect to deep purple.This should not have been made.It has only one good song on it,anya.The rest of this utter junk is a throw away.With a great singer in ian gillan and a great guitar player like blackmore,you wonder how they could have made this joke.Deep purple fans stay away from this lemon,check out deep purple in olympia."
3,Just about what I expected from them,"I used to have this album. I feel that it was a far cry better than ""Perfect Strangers"", ""House Of Blue Light"", and ""Slaves and Masters"" combined. Ian Gillian is back at the mike to croon his usual fare. The title track, ""One Man's Meat"", and ""Time To Kill"" especially ""Time To Kill"" are the best. It was a shame this was overlooked in the days of grunge and thrash. This showed the group still had what it took to rock. As I said it's a far cry better than their first 3 post reunion albums, but it's not good enough to be a classic. The songs are recycled, but done in the traditional Deep Purple sound. Hopefully they'll continue to rock even though Jon Lord is retired, and almost 70. It's good to have them back."
2,rather weak album from Mark II C,"The album is not excellent, Blackmore lacked on his skills, because he felt very tired of Deep purple, Gillan is goin older he can't sing it again like for 20 years earlier,...Blackmore left DP after making this album,..the last testimonial DP ritual of Hard rock music"
1,This CD makes a nice coaster...,I gave this CD away. It was pure... and had little resemblance to the DP of old. Whoever said this album should not have been made was right.I got it free through a CD club...sure glad I didn'y buy it.
1,The battle was already lost...,After letting Joe Lynn Turner go(due to pressures from the record label)Deep Purple re-reunited for their worst album ever.
1,Truly uninspired....,"Ok, I am actually a big fan of the classic Deep Purple line-up but this CD ""The Battle Rages On"" is really BAD! It should be titled ""The Cattle Grazes On"" it is rumoured Ritchie Blackmore was paid big $$$ to make this album & re-hire Ian Gillan & it shows! Buy this at your own risk!"
3,Not a bad release,"I think some people were a little harsh when reviewing this album. The title track itself is the heaviest I've ever heard Deep Purple, it's has such great guitar-work especially around 3:30 when you hear the ""dueling"" guitars! ""Anya"" has a great acoustic opener, then kicks into some fancy vocal and guitar. ""Ramshackle Man"" is a great blues-sounding track, while ""Solitaire"" has some very haunting lyrics. ""One Man's Meat,"" is a great song, even through the stupid lyrics. I'm not going to say that this was the best Deep Purple album, because it really wasn't. ""Lick it Up"" is such a trash song, ""Time to Kill"" has an awful chorus. The songs that I spoke of kindly really more than make up for the other trash on here. The title track and ""Anya"" are really worth the money. Give it a try."
2,the last ritual with Blackmore on guitar,"this album is rather slow and narrow,...their hard rock sound is not hard as a rock! Blackmore lacked his skills on this album,...because he has no love and desire anymore to deep Purple,...he left in 1994, his place was took over by Steve Morse. the last ritual testimonial for DP with Blackmore....Anja is an excellent song,...the album track itself is also cool."
2,or maybe 2.5 if that matters...,"""The battle rages on"" is far from the heights Deep Purple reached earlier in their career, and some might even wonder if it's the ""same"" band that recorded ""Machine head"", ""Burn"" or ""Perfect strangers"". In comparison, ""The battle rages on"" falls flat since many of the songs are at best forgettable, with exception of the title track: ""The battle rages on"" and ""Anya"". Maybe the blues-boogie inspired ""Ramshackle man"" and the slower ""Solitaire"" are above average but there's too many fillers on this one."
4,Half my order was missing and I've gotten no satisfaction from the seller or from Amazon,"The story of the 1914 Christmas Truce is, without doubt, one of the only hope-filled stories to emerge from the carnage of the First World War. I was looking forward to receiving both the book, with its magnificent illustrations, along with the CD, as advertised and for which I paid.When the product arrived, there was the book but no CD. I've been around in circles trying to have the matter resolved. Amazon directed me the seller. The seller redirected me to Amazon. I've filed a report but, to date, no one has come back to me with a satisfactory resolution. So, on this item, I feel I have been short changed and I'm very disappointed with Amazon. Resolving issues like this should be much easier.The book is wonderful, the Robert T. Barrett illustrations are brilliant. I just wish I had been able to listen to the iconic Walter Cronkite read this worldclass story about a moment of humanity in an age of carnage."
1,The tragedy of war.,"The book is nicely done with pictures I think intended to soften the images of war, the dead soldiers, etc. I ordered the book to send to my children as my youngest is currently serving in Iraq. I found it too upsetting to read about the tragic loss of lives and it was not something I wanted my grandchildren, ages 1-12 to read. It is well done, but it was just too sad for me."
4,Old Nucci,"L'opéra italien, et Verdien, n'a plus de soucis pour Leo Nucci, d'ailleurs, si je ne me trompe, je crois bien que Nucci n'a jamais abordé ""que"" l'opéra italien; je me souviens de lui, jeune et pimpant, au début des années 70, dans un mémorable ""Barbiere di Siviglia"" avec la pétulante Marilyn Horne (énorme succès!).Trente ans après, la voix a perdu de son éclat et de sa brillance, mais le comédien demeure, habile et efficace. Dans ce nouveau Rigoletto, il est entouré d'une équipe formidable : le ténor et la soprano sont jeunes, beaux, et chantent remarquablement bien. Pour Nucci, c'est le Rigoletto de la maturité, et la mise en scène, les décors, les costumes, sont magnifiques. Beau travail, et belle retransmission d'opéra."
4,Bright and sunny!,"This is a great lamp. The bulb is fantastic, just the right wattage and very sunny. The clamp lamp itself is a little tricky to get to stay on a dome-top style cage, but it will work you just need to stretch the legs further apart or they will slip inside.Word to the wise: do not use this for extended amounts of time in the beginning as brand new bulbs that close to a bird can do more harm than good! I only use this a few times a week for 30-40 minutes and my birds really do seem to enjoy it. (I have an Amazon, Conure, and Parrotlet)"
5,RE; BUGGIN TUNE,"HI, THE TUNE THAT IS BUGGIN YOU IS ... JOE JACKSON - STEPPING OUT. IT HAD ME GUESSING FOR A WHILE TOO."
3,Why is Studio Tantrum on this??,"I bought this thinking the DJ Toni Studio Tantrum was gonna be something special. Turns out, it shouldn't even be ON HERE because it's not a tantrum. Just a useless sample of ""Self Control"" tied together with a sample of INXS's song. Thanks Amazon...for nothing."
1,Under - designed or poor manufacturing,"The product literature says it holds 250 lbs. I am 225 lbs and used this chair once at the beach. After sitting down slowly, the stitching ripped apart where the cloth arm rest meets the front metal pipe. I would not buy if you weight over 150 lbs."
2,"Not quite a recliner... Not quite ""auto"" either.","This chair is comfortable and convenient. Easy to tote, no doubt.However, the ""auto-reclining"" claim implies that the chair has multiple angles for the back. That perhaps the ""auto"" means the more pressure you apply with your back, the further back it goes, or at least provides some range of motion and more than one setting.Sadly this is not the case. The back has one position. It is a comfortable position, but only one position.If you are looking for added convenience, great range of motion/ reclining in the back, and even a handy cooler, I would recomend either theRio Ultimate Backpack Beach Chair w/ cooler - Blue Textilene,Tommy Bahama Backpack Cooler Chair with Storage Pouch and Towel Bar, orUltimate Backpack Beach Chair with Cooler - LayFlat 5 position. All are comfortable, portable, backpackers with more than one back position."
2,Strap broke,"I bought the Reclining Backpack Outdoor Chair for my seven day camping trip. I needed something comfortable, portable, and light to carry on my backpack. This chair seemed to fit my needs. It worked great for the first two days of use and I was extremely happy with it. But on the third day, the hand strap broke when I was sitting on it. What a disappointment! When I got home, I have tried everything to fix it. No luck! The hole that hooks the handle is ripped. Now, it sits in my garage and I may have to throw it out. The only reason that I gave this chair a two star rating is that it was comfortable for the first two days."
4,Backpack chair,"Took to Hawaii on a cruise. Was perfect for bringing on and off the ship as I explored a new beach each day. Fit as carry-on for the plane. Zipper bag is small, only big enough for one book, also topples over fairly easy b/c of tripod configuration. Other than that it was easy to use and comfortable."
5,A WINNER!!!!,"Strong,sturdy,comfortable. Lightweight, stores and carries like a backpack. The optional canopy is easy to add on and completes this chairs design perfectly."
3,Actually may appeal to non-fans,"Life in a Tin Can has been unavailable for many years and it's great to see it back. This album, for Bee Gees fans (and you know who you are!), is unique. It is unlike any other project they have produced and is worthy of a listen. Sometimes a bit too country for it's own good, but nonetheless, easy, sweet music."
3,"Ironic That It's Called ""Life In A Tin Can""!","This album is perhaps their weakest because it seems like it has no direction! One source called this album ""songs filled with sensitive ballads"". ""I Saw A New Morning"" is in the box set which will save most people from buying this album. Like ""Tralfagar"", I won't say ""Don't buy this album"" because you may like it. However, they had better albums than this!"
4,"Short, but ok","Other than ""While I Play"", most of the songs on this album are aight. The hit song ""Saw A New Morning"" is without a topic and too plain. The other extremely minor ""I Don't Wanna Be The One"" is fun to hear. ""My Life Has Been A Song"" is the only other good song on this cd. Barry's parts are great and the words in the song are very different than their usual routined words. ""Come Home Johnnie Bridie"" is weird, but somewhat catchy. Especially that chorus. ""Living In Chicago"" is way too long for no reason, just like the earlier Odessa. ""Method To My Madness"" sounds like a throw-in. They really didn't spend time on that song for sure. ""South Dakota Morning"" is boring. No melodies, no good voices, and boring words. But overall, not a horrible cd and put it together its a pretty good cd. Not a must have though."
1,Rejects from a rejected album,"I am a tremendous fan, and I hate to possibly ruin sales for this album, but you have to be a real diehard to elicit any sense of accomplishment on the part of the brothers. This album is nothing more than rejects from a time period when another BeeGee album was rejected by the record company. Unless you're a fan of Jim Keltner (who has done some great drum work for other artists), don't waste your time."
4,Passionate Wedding,"Blood Wedding by Lorca is an excellent book, full of excellent imagery and real images that leap out at you. The storyline holds your attention and keeps it till you finish it. The story is told in a beautiful, moving way and haunts you long after you finish reading the book."
3,Not a bad read.,"I have enjoyed this series thus far. The mixing of fantasy and real world 19th century history works better than I first believed. There are plenty of rich details about the life of the dragons and their riders as well as the society. The only problem I have with these novels is that they seem to follow the ""Mercedes Lackey"" school of plotting: big action in the beginning then a long, slow middle, with all the various plotlines resolved too quickly in the last 40 pages. With each of the novels I have had to backtrack over the last 2 chapters or so just to figure out what was going on. I will still read any further release in the series though as they are absorbing reads."
3,Easy Reading,"I bought the book originally because I read that Peter Jackson of The Lord of The Rings fame had bought the film rights to the series. The book and indeed the series are very easy reading and would appeal to anyone interested in this fantasy genre though if you are looking for anything particularly clever or challenging, look elsewhere. All in all I think it will make a better film than a book."
2,The logic is off.,"The premises of the book does not work. The author wants us to believe it is wiser to have Lawrence, the dragon, and the crew, walk across the dessert for 28 days to 30 days instead of fly it in 6 or 7 days. It states in the book that the dragon can only fly 100 miles a day.... come on! By his size and wing span he covers a 100 miles in less then 2 hours. Birds can fly 150 miles a day! The estimates of the distances, time, food, water etc. do not match mathematically. The author also wants us to believe that Lawrence is going to allow this ""shady character"" to lead them across the dessert even after realizing that the orders from command are in question because they would have been written before they had left China. The logic of the story falls apart and there is no depth to the story line. The first book was great, the 2nd okay, and this 3rd is horrible. Should I try number 4?"
2,I just don't care any more...,"I would have given the first book 4 stars for being creative and original, with decent writing. All of that went downhill in the second book, which would have rated 1 star. This book is 2-3 for me; ending with 2 because I had to force myself to read the last ~70 pages just to get to the end... only to find it doesn't really end.On the bright side, at least some things happen in this book compared to the second. And there isn't the disjointed pace. But the characters have no depth and you don't really care about any of them (quick, name a crewman aside from Granby), and even the leads have lost their interest by this point. The foreshadowing of the Prussian's military outcome is so heavily done that each battle is painful to read, waiting for the shoe to drop."
5,Breathtaking Adventure,"This continuing saga of Temeraire and his Captain, Will Laurence, thrusts them into the thick of Napoleon's march across Europe as they try to convey feral dragons and eggs back to Britain after their adventures in China, as detailed in Book Two of the series, ""Throne of Jade."" Temeraire's experience in China gives Laurence a devil of a time explaining the politics of why it's acceptable for British dragons to be treated as little better than serfs when in China they are revered, respected, and allowed to have their own warmed pagodas. The feral dragons are unruly and the hatching of one egg introduces a fiery little holy terror into the group. Battles in Prussia, daring rescues, and the horrific vengeance the great Chinese dragon Lien hopes to exact keep the action lively. A great read, and a great series."
3,Just ok. Not as good as His Majesty's Dragon,"I was really engrossed in the first book of this series, His Majesty's Dragon, and even found the second to be interested but the third was slow and disappointing. The book did pick up pace towards the end with the hatching of a new dragon during a battle and siege but that wasn't enough to make me move on to the next book in this series. A shame. I really enjoyed the concept but this book was too repetitive for me."
5,Incredibly Entertaining!,"This whole series has been a delightful read! I am a huge fan of all things dragon, but the way the dragons are involved here is wonderful. I have a friend who is a huge Napoleon Era buff, and he says that Naomi did an excellent job with that information as well. As a reviewer said below, the cliffhanger in Book 3 will make you absolutely nuts waiting for the next book! Write faster, please!"
2,Boring,"In the first two books, Novik did a wonderful job and exploring the relationship issues and prejudices existing, not only involving a smart talking dragon, but between people, cultures and countries. All of that was left behind in this attempt at war and strategy. I was bored and struggled to get through the pages at this attempt at military strategy - even with a dragon like Temeraire."
4,An enjoyable light read,"While not as entertaining as the first 2 in the series,it is well worth reading. The book is a little uneven at times but it 'feels' like a necessary bridge to forthcomming adventures. A good read."
3,Not as good as the first two,"I really loved the first book in this series, and enjoyed the second one a lot as well, but this third one I thought was rather dull. It seemed as if the author had gotten so caught up in the military/tactical/adventure elements of the story that she neglected the interpersonal factor. If you like Patrick O'Brien or Bernard Cornwall, this probably won't bother you, but my own tastes demand that the characters charm or intrigue me, and in this book there wasn't enough of that to keep me reading. I actually ended up skimming the last 150 pages, unwilling to slog through any more Napoleonic War stuff. I hope that future volumes of the series will get back to the really engaging business of dragon/captain relationships. Novik does it so well, it's a shame to see her skimp on it!"
3,"Very good characters, so-so novel and plot","Ho hum to the whole French, Austrian, Prussian war thing. There was no heart in it. The trip through the desert and the time at the Pasha's seemed so meaningless to the plot, I felt I was wasting time ""get to the good stuff"". The third book could have easily been entirely set in the Ottomon empire with the sultan and fire-breathing Turkish dragons.This third installment was pretty hard to get through both crossing the desert and the battle with the French. It got bogged down in the military/historical stuff. I definitely felt the plot suffered. I fell in love with the characters. For me, the most emotional moment of the entire novel was when Iskierka was born. She gave the rest of the novel LIFE. I skimmed a lot of the war strategy stuff, finding it wasn't adding anything.I can't wait for the next installment to go back to the dragons, the aviators, the relationships... what made me fall in love with His Majesty's Dragon."
4,Series remains excellent.,"Naomi Novik, Black Powder War (Del Rey, 2006)The third book in Novik's Temeraire series is just as much fun as the first two. The crew, waiting to head back to England after their odd, if successful, jaunt to China, are intercepted with a message asking them to go overland and pick up three dragon eggs in Istanbul that the Turks have just sold to the British. This involves a long trek across the desert (as this whole series has been a ""what if [x] had dragons?"" scenario, I can't help but think Novik had Lawrence of Arabia in mind here). But, of course, once they finally get to Istanbul, they find that their troubles are far from over...If you liked the first two, this one's a must. Novik has quietly carved a name for herself in an age glutted with fantasy series as a high-quality practitioner of the art; if you haven't encountered her yet, she's well worth a try. ****"
2,"dreary disappointment, just one long string of depressing battles","after the exuberance of the first book in this trilogy, His Majesty's Dragon, I found the 2nd book (Throne of Jade) to be a boring series of political arguments and this 3rd book to be a boring series of weary battles. OK, the feral dragons lightened it up a bit, but it was, overall, a depressing book with no satisfying resolutions. The author is obviously more interested in keeping the franchise going than in pleasing her readers or taking care of her characters. Enough already! If I hadn't fallen in love with Temeraire enough to keep slogging on, I would never have finished this book. Buy it used!"
4,Interesting Summer Read,"I enjoyed this book and it reminded me of similar Rosemond Pilcher books. The story is slow in getting started and at times I could not relate to the protagonist, but I enjoyed the story. Too often novels are bogged down in lengthy character and setting descriptions, but this was not one of them. The story itself and the journey that young Fede takes is what captivated me. I would recommend this novel and its story."
5,How To Paint Flames,"If you want to start doing flame jobs, here's the book for you. Clear explinations about design, taping and masking, painting techniques and tips, and a lot of close-up pictures showing exactly what's going on. All types of flames are covered: traditional, tribal, ghost, etc. Lots of tips about equipment, paint, and airbrushes and spray guns. This is a real valuable beginners guide to the art of flaming out stuff!!!"
5,Excellent. Great photos with lots of ideas,"I was not aware that there are so many varity,s of flames and related graphics. This is an excellent book to jump start your efforts. It also includes some great links to the many suppliers and artists that define the world of automotive art."
4,like the title says..........,This really does show you how to paint flames and in lots of styles. Well worth picking up if this area interests you.
5,Hot Book,"If you want a great overveiw of how to apply flames, this is the book. If you want to learn how to apply flames, this is the place to start. It gives detailed instructions, materials, and brand names, so you get started right, and getting started right gives you a great base for gaining expearance."
5,Great investment,"I needed a walker to assist me on my everyday needs. I can't walk very far because of anemia. I get out of breath too soon. This provides me with strong, stable assistance as well as a sturdy seat for rests. It really does hold the weight comfortably. The basket is a nice addition."
5,Lifesaver Rooter Scooter,"This thing was a lifesaver since I was in a non walking cast for an Achilles tendon tear for 8 weeks and couldn't get around. I was able to ride it on the seat even though it wasn't designed for that. I weigh upwards of 300+ pounds and the device had no problems shuttling me around in lieu of an expensive wheelchair. It is lightweight enough to get into the trunk of a car, but heavy duty enough to support well above even my weight when riding. Duro-Med will get future business from me down the road when I need products of this nature in retirement. Worth every dollar and more. And they shipped it to me over night. How can you beat that? Outstanding...."
4,Very Good Quality Walker w/Seat - Recommended,"We bought this Duro-Med ""Extra-Wide Aluminum Rollator"" for my aging and significantly overweight mother who has ""slowed down"" quite a bit in the last year. This walker is making a big difference in how well my mother gets around and she is very happy with it. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Sturdy; this is well made and easily supports my mother's weight (holds up to 375 lbs)+ Easy to Assemble; took less than 10 minutes to attach the handles, front bar, and basket+ Folds; collapses to fit in a car trunk+ Basket; the basket can be placed under the seat or in the front and is very handy+ Affordable; we shopped around and this was very reasonable in comparison to others with the same featuresCons -- Seat Height; the seat isn't adjustable so my 5'5"" tall mother's feet dangle about an inch off the ground when seatedMisc -* As another reviewer noted, this can actually be used as a makeshift wheelchairHighly Recommended!CFH"
4,"Finally, a Rollator","After ordering a similar rollator from another website, cancelling the order after 6 weeks of delays, then reordering it from yet another website which turned out to be the same source and realizing after another month of delays that it may never be shipped, I ordered this one from Amazon. It arrived within 4 days. The price was great, the quality is fine, my only complaint is that it doesn't fold as small as I would have liked it."
2,More than I bargained for,"After looking at many rolling walkers and reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this one. The seat is extra-wide to accommodate me, and I can even fold it up and put it in the trunk of the car. The BIG downside to this walker is that the overall height (the wheelbase to the seat) is NOT adjustable, only the handles. When I need to sit I must put on the breaks and then tiptoe up to shimmy onto the seat. Then, when I sit fully on the seat my both feet swing freely, I'm 5'5"" tall. Since this is extra-wide, I have found that it does not go through a few of the doors in my house. I would heartily recommend it to tall plus-size persons and you might want to check the opening measurement of your doors."
4,Nice Overall Rollator.,"A positive (90%) purchase experience. Three details prevent me from issuing 5 stars. Right hand brake does not engage the wheel. Adjustments are provided for, although no instructions on how it works. Seat is 22"" from ground, no adjustment provided to lower to 21"" which would make it perfect for me. Last, the screw heads for bolts come into contact with my ankles and calves. quite painful for me so I used some cut-down foam swimming pool noodles to cover the offending hardwear."
3,rolling walker,The only thing I am unhappy about is the descrition of color. The only thing titanium on it is the handle bars. The rest is a dull gray. I would not have bought it knowing that. It is too much trouble to return. In the picture it shows a blue gray color.
4,it is wide,"This item was easy to put together but when I tried to get it in my car, it would not fit. One of my neighbors was also in need of this item and it fit in her car so she has it now and it very happy with it. It is comfortable and a very good price."
4,Good Rolling walker,"Overall very pleased with this- my dad is a bigger guy and the seat fits well. Does not hold together though when you fold it up- you have to put on the brake to get it to stay. The construction is very sturdy though and he feels confident while using it. Due to the oversized nature, it it a bit of a tight fit in the backseat. But again, it gives him confidence in moving so that's the most important function of the Rollator."
1,Not Happy!,"This rollator came with the right hand brake missing. I called the manufacturer, the distributor and Amazon. None of them could supply the missing piece and wanted me to pack it up and they would pick it up and reship. I figured if it was that difficult to get an integral part for this rollator, I didn't want it and just told them to pick it up. I ended up purchasing the Nova Mini Mack from a different manufacturer and was very happy with my purchase."
5,Doing flips for Leonardo,"My 3 year old stepson received this for Christmas and he loves playing with it! That is when his dad and I aren't playing with it! Simply press him forward and he flips backwards, viola! I must say that we were surprised when he landed on his feet not only once, but over and over! The 3 year old wasn't to worried about trying to knock down the wall, but he loves making it flip backwards to hit the cats!"
4,"A brilliant, succinct, introduction to Orthodox Ecclesiology","I found this book to be a fantastic brief introduction to the ecclesiology of the Orthodox Church. However, it is not for theological lightweights. It is not ""ecclesiology for dummies."" Nor is it a defense for Orthodox ecclesiology. As a result, if you're new to the subject (don't feel bad, we've all been there) you may want to start somewhere else. However, if you've put in your time studying heavy theology (Protestant, Roman Catholic, or Orthodox) you'll likely find Christ and the Church to be a good introduction to the theanthropic ecclesiology of Eastern Orthodoxy. The only complaint I have about the book is its length. I could have done with 100-200 more pages. I personally like the Archbishop's writing style. In comparison to some other, longer, books on the same subject (e.g., The Mystery of the Church) I found the Archbishop's book to be very helpful. (Note: I'm a covert from Reformed Protestantism to the Orthodox Church.)"
4,Good DVD,Very good DVD to give tips of how to use a camcorder under the water and it is useful for any kind of shots.It helped me a lot
5,I wish that all parents would read this!!,"Most of the advice in the book goes against the currently trendy ""progressive/attachment"" parenting style so I'm not that surprised about a few negative reviews.However, the negative reviewers have clearly misrepresented the authors advice. It is possible that they have their own unresolved childhood issues and that reading the book may have triggered painful memories of fear and abandonment.The author sites 14 references including Brazelton and Ferber.I found this book to offer an excellent common sense approach that points out the importance of respecting your baby. If you want to raise healthy, independent, cooperative and emotionally secure children then Gerber's approach will surely help.Along with First Feelings: Milestones in the Emotional Development of Your Baby and Child ISBN: 0140119884I give these two books my highest recommendation."
4,Wonderful book!,"This book is by the Magda Gerber, who developed the Resources for Infant Educarers approach. I've heard of this approach before, and was eager to learn more about it. Admittedly, there are some chapters that are worth skipping, but nevertheless it provides much food for thoughts. I can't say I'll follow Magda's advice to the ""T"", but there's a lot of great advice on how to encourage baby to develop important life skills from the get-go and also for me to really think through what the baby's perspective might be like."
2,"Should be titled ""hands off parenting""","While I enjoyed parts of this book and thought SOME of the suggestions and advise were good, the overall tone of the book bothered me. She seems to be suggesting that we should be striving to make our babies as independent as possible, as early as possible. She claims that her philosophy is the most natural way to raise a child, but she encourages parents to stop relying on their natural instinct. For example, she is against picking up a crying baby. She is against cosleeping. She is against babywearing.However, her suggestions to observe your child and to let your child reach her developmental milestones on her own seem to be good ones."
4,"A great gift for ""new parents"" and ""parent-to-be""s","Gerber's book is a good start for everyone who wants to develop their knowledge on early-childhood. For someone who wants to do this, there are zillions of books on the subject out there. What makes this book different from most of the others is in its approach: it is more scientifically supported, rather than giving intuitive opinions only. Especially if you don't have too much background on the issue, this book will be a good choice for all lay-readers.After i read the book (partially though), I decided that this book will be a great gift as a baby-gift for friends and bought 2 more copies and gave it to 2 different friends of ours as a gift for their new babies.Perhaps it is not ""THE book"" on early childhood, but one of them among the published ones."
5,Peaceful Infant Care,"Do you worry if your infant is ""doing things on time""? Magda Gerber reassures parents that a baby will self-develop peacefully when parents follow her guidelines. There is no need to buy a lot of baby equipment or enroll in baby gymnastic classes. Babies will develop naturally when guided gently and given lots of time to work freely. Her words are so practical that one wonders why we have moved away from this method of infant care. This book is not only informative but also warmly reassuring for parents."
2,"Another Childrearing Guru, Sigh.","This is another baby-raising advice book that promises THE method to produce a happy, self-confident child. There is some wisom in it (I'm all for respecting children and giving them space to become themselves) but I found the book annoyingly preachy and, in the end, silly. The advice includes: don't touch a child unless you have permission first, don't give a baby any toys to play with on the changing table, don't pick up a crying child, don't let the child eat at the table with adults, don't use strollers, high chairs are off-limits--all that stuff seems a little cultish and ultimately sort of random. Since the approach is guru-driven (like most childrearing methods), there's no real evidence or research presented. Who's to say all this studied ignoring of babies won't produce needy, emotionally distant kids? Even so, if you're reading every baby book you can get your hands on, this one is worth adding to the pile."
2,Sort of a strange take on some things,"While the book has some great ideas and questions our assumptions about how we interact with babies, some ideas of this approach seem odd. Such as seeing the act of burping your baby as hitting? Or that rocking your baby is inappropriate? I very much agree with another reviewer who said this book is written in a ""know-it-all"" tone, too. I only tolerate that tone when there is research to back it up."
1,nefarious!,"When I was a teenager, there was a Grape Nuts cereal commercial that advertisers rated as the worst ad of the year. Did Grape Nuts cancel the commercials? No! They made even more variants. They must have decided that being the worst was more advantageous than being just one in the crowd. The same thing happens here. This sequel takes a bad first movie and makes it worse. The main character was not endearing from the jump, so the movie makers made him even more annoying this time around. It was understandable when he made bad decisions as a closeted man, but as an insecure boyfriend, he really scratches the chalkboard with his nails. Other people have noted that the men in this flick are not as hot as in the first one. I'd add that this sequel had fewer men, not just less attractive ones. I can only assume that the movie makers and the cast wanted to make something so terrible that one has to work hard to erase it from his memory."
4,Great stuff.,"Loved the remake albumSoft Machine, so I picked up the original. It is well worth it. Very pop-synth-rock. The originals are way better."
4,A slight twist on Teddybears,"I received this CD after first listening to ""Teddybears Slthm"" & was surprised at the difference of the band's sound. Different, but still good. A great followup to the popular hit."
4,Great road trip CD,"This was one of the better ""Glam Rock"" CDs of the era. Good mood swings and the album kicks off with the too cool Bad Seamstress Blues / Fallin' Apart at the Seams. Saw these guys open for Judas Priest in '88 and they kicked it off with that song. Awe inspiring. Since most of you who are reading this probably own the CD or have owned it in the past, I recommend you put it back in your rotation for a few weeks. Not every song is great, but you don't have to skip too many to enjoy it. You should buy this if you live anywhere it snows between October and April.Anybody remember when Britney Fox came out after these guys? HILARIOUS! Cinderella with bigger bangs, frillier shirts and mediocre songs. MTV used to be so fun!"
5,Brilliant,"This album is by far Tom Keifer's best songwriting. It's got just enough metal (Gypsy Road) mixed with a bluesy/southern thingy (Bad Seamstress Blues, intro to The Last Mile). Although, I'll admit he went overboard with the bluesy/southern thingy on Heartbreak Station, but this album is up there with Back In Black and Appetite For Destruction, if you ask me. It doesn't get much better than Bad Seamstress Blues/Fallin' Apart At The Seams or Last Mile or Gypsy Road or Don't Know What You Got 'till It's Gone...great from cover to cover. Even the slide work on Take Me Back is brilliant. I've read where Tom says he knows this is their best work and he wishes he could write another like this.Stay away from Heartbreak Station or Still Climbing--the only decent songs on these discs are on the greatest hits album.The only band to make the transition so far is L.A. Guns. Their 'new' CD, Waking The Dead is great, by far the best 80's metal album since the 80's--from any band."
5,What can I say?,"So much has been said about this album. So many positive things have been said of 'Long Cold Winter'. I don't often find myself agreeing with other peoples music reviews, but with this recording I make an exception. The riffs, the bass lines, the leads, the solos, the fantastic production, the excellent drumming--it's all here. All this in 1988, of all times. At a time when people where losing control of their bodily fluids for the ""hot"" single ""Bad Medicine"" and the legion of Jovi fanatics. And GNR can keep their 'Appetite For Destruction'.With 'Long Cold Winter', I get the hard rock and I get the ballads. There are actually GOOD lyrics on this record. While I am not a die-hard Cinderella fan, I do believe this very recording to be one of the greatest of its time. One of the greatest albums of the 80's."
4,Cinderella is not a hair band ....,"they are close but they are more blue's infused than any other rock band out there. I saw them in San Antonio last night and their live show, sound and setlist were over the top and impressive. Thier four release's ie Night Songs, SC, Long Cold Winter and HBS are above avg cd's and releases. See them live and you will not be disappointed."
1,Catholic schools in poor neighborhoods?,"Money does matter, but it is not the cure here. In inner cities public schools can spend up to three times the amount spent by catholic schools per student. Yet catholic schools consistantly outperform public schools across the board - reading, writing, social studies, science and math. For example, 80% of NY catholic school high school students are able to pass at least one regents exam, compared to 2% of public high school students. Come on, lets stop denying the obvious and focus on fixing a sick, cruel system failing kids whose only chance is education."
5,A great read for the sports enthusiast,"This book was a great read for anyone who has ever placed a sports wager in Vegas or at home. The ebb and flow of victorious weekens and buried ones is incredible. It also adds an extra viewpoint by following the guys who run the Stardust. Excellent, quick read."
3,Profiles of people for a season,"This book is about a few gamblers and their lives during a college basketball season. It does also cover some football including the super bowel. The people working at the sports book are also profiled. The gamblers profiled are full time gamblers at different stages of their life. This book doesn't glamorize the gambler, instead they are seen as leading a rough life.The book takes place when the Rams and Titan's played in the super bowel.You'll learn how the lines are produce.I did like that it had brief snippets on gambling laws."
3,"One Season, Three Gamblers, and the Death of Their Las Vegas",This quick read about what makes the world of sports betting tick from the perspective of the gambler and the casino reads like an extended magazine article (not surprising as the author is a former Sports Illustrated writer and now a contributor to ESPN The Magazine). What I found most enlightening was the world of the sports book managers of the casino's. The devotion to setting the proper line was facinating and speaks to the business of sports book - the odds are set by a person everyday and the books profits or losses are determined by how well the line is drawn. Also of real interest is how the on-line books have taken the major gambling action away from Vegas and is the death of old Vegas. Its not about action its about profits as Vegas has become a corporate entity. Interesting in the end but I would have enjoyed a little more analysis of the structure of what has brought about these shifts in the way money drives sports.
4,Flipping our for Raph!,"My 3 year old stepson received Raph along with Leo for Christmas and he absolutely loves them! Just press down and Raph does and instant flip! The only problem we have had with Raph though is that he doesn't seem to want to land on his feet. Although I don't think the 3 year old has noticed at all! It hasn't stopped him from playing with it! He loves pushing them both down and making them flip into each other, kind of as if they were jumping into the air and crashing into each other. Great toy for a TMNT fan!"
3,Greatest Hits ... LIVE!,"Yes, these are Kool & The Gang's greatest hits. No, they aren't the original hit recordings. This is, however, a very good collection of the band playing their hits live."
5,Good tunes and a fun romp through Shakespeare's canon!,"This album is really enjoyable and accessible. You don't have to know Shakespeare to enjoy this album, but of course, the more Shakespeare you know - the more you'll enjoy these songs!Their arrangements are quirky and fun and their harmonies are spot on!My favorites are - Sweet Viola, Irish Dement and A Lover and His Lass.Fun for all!"
4,Satisfied Customer,"Palm Merriam-Webster Dictionary/Franklin Thesaurus is a very good product. It gives clear, concise definitions.The only thing that I have to deal with is that I have an SD memory card that I keep in, so I must bring the dictionary card with me wherever I go. That is not too hard, though, because I carry a purse."
4,Mini dictionary,"Its not a bad dictionary, but its only 30.4 mbs and from 2003. It would be the equivalent of a small pocket dictionary, very limited collection of words. I would say get it if its under $10, but I would not say it is worth the retail $30 or so."
3,My Palm Dictionary do not work well.,"Of the Thesauros and Dictionary,the last do not work properly. Some times the software are not loaded and frequently block the entire device."
1,What is a MobiReader?,"Sure, the dictionary has a lot of words, but the problem is finding them. The search screen is extremely jumpy when using the graffiti interface. I can rarely get more than a couple letters in the search box before the program jumps off to the wrong word.Now my graffiti skills are pretty good; I don't have this kind of problem with other Palm programs. The dictionary's search program (MobiReader?) doesn't want to wait for t's to be crossed and i's to be dotted. So a search for 'tea' and you'll end up with the first word starting with 'L'. I've resorted to using the popup keyboard screen to enter words. Not what I've come to expect from Palm-based programs."
1,Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionar,"I got this for my new PalmOne Zire 72. The dictionary has lots of function but doesn't work well with my palm. Everytime when I try to write a ""t"", it will go back to the previous screen instead of having a ""t"" on my word. And the software itself is not easy to use. After I have used it for a few times, it started to crash my operating system everytime I try to open the dictionary or insert the dictionary sd card to my palm. If you own a Zire 72, my best suggestion is not to get this dictionary. I returned mine and got another different one; it doesn't have as many functions as the Merriam-Webster's, but it works great and easy to use. Most importantly, it's completely capatible with my palm pilot."
4,Good Stuff!,"Overhead hails out of Finland and is more proof that the best prog is still coming out of the Scandinavian countries. Overhead does a wonderful blend between heavy prog and symphonic prog. If you enjoy bands such as RPWL, Transatlantic, Knight Area then Overhead is for you! Switching back and forth, almost seamlessly between melodic symphonic parts and heavier guitar parts in most of their songs, their longer tracks are never boring or repetitive. They do not get quite as heavy as Dream Theater and are more melodic than Porcupine Tree, but definitely not metal prog. Vocals here are top rate (in English) which tend to be the bane of a lot of progressive groups. They have a nice well rounded sound that I believe will please symphonic prog lovers as well as those who want to rock out a bit more. Between ""Metaepitome"" and ""And We're Not Here After All"" I would probably choose the later, but both are excellent. Just buy both!"
5,Tranquil,"This cd is just lovely...so tranquil. Great for a little peace in ones life. I play it every morning, turns the mornings into sheer pleasure. It gives you a relaxed feeling and approach to your day."
3,Some Good Advice,"This book has good basic advice. Some of the tips however, are a bit over the top. ""Use a nonpunitive approach to discipline....nonviolent forms of punsihment (sunch as withholding privilges, creating artivicial ""consequence,"" or isolating your child) can also damage your child's sense of emotional safety."" Are you kidding me? As a parent, I consider myself pretty permissive, but this even got to me. There are consequences to every action and while this may have worked for the author's children, it will not work with every household or child.There is some good advice. A few of the tips I liked were about creating a climate of emotional safey, finding afterschool activities for your child, teach responsibility etc.. Overall, I felt there was a lot of good advice. I will use the book for some guidelines and trust my own judgement on other tips."
4,"a little abstract, but incredible","This is a very fun album that at times is a little weird, but overall very enjoyable!"
4,Too Eclectic,"Sure a little bossa nova is great, along with some great electronic songs, but then you have songs like Pink Freud and Pinkerland Becaina that just sound out of place. Lets just put it this way, the cd is worth buying for great tracks like Karma Hunters, Maybe Next Saturday, and L'Heros. You can always skip the ones that are not of your gusto like I do."
5,Shintaro Katsu: 1000 Oscars would not suffice.,"This guy's acting is beyond this world. The stories and landscapes are incredible. Maybe the film-making technique is a little rusty some times, but in the whole it is effective."
3,If you must have all of the Zatoichi films,A well priced collection of the less wonderful story lines. Zatoichi is always the great blind swordsman but there is less atmosphere and character development in the films included in this collection.
4,Zatoichi - The Blind Swordsman Box Set,"OK, this definately looks very promising. I saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago. It was good. If that is any indication on how good the show is then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should be better. I am going to purchase this soon. Once I purchase it, I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes .A month ago is when I really learned of this series so I am truly looking forward to watching this series.Goddess Anjanee :)"
3,good box,why not a 1-26 box? is this not available?iam lookong for theeseor comes a box out? later?does it exist in german language?
5,Saucy!,"What can I say about this? It was an all star line up of actors, and they were incredible! The lead ranger was HANDSOME...actually, that fox was downright sexy! His eyes drew me in like a vortex cyclone from the legend of zelda. Unfortunately, the I got lost in his eyebrows like fanghorn forest! I digress, anyway, the acting was incredible. It was like the lineup out of Oceans 11! The plot was incredible! The falls in Shiloh Falls were incredible! The actions scenes were incredible. The water tower was incredible. The sour warhead that Dalton was eating the whole movie was apparently INCREDIBLE!!! Did I mention the horses were very incredible? The gay cowboy artist was nice too. Was that Jake Gyllenhaal? Anyway, back to that plot! This was definitely the best mystic zombie possession romance western I've scene in decades! Ok, well I'm gonna go get some orange juice and play Fireblades for Gamecube!Fireblade"
1,Don't waste your money or time... a STINKER,"This was one of the worst ""movies"" I have ever tried to watch. Bad acting, bad directing, stupid story, just awful in every way. After I realized how bad it was I searched to the end, life is too short.Note: I had to give it 1 star, only because Amazon requires at least 1 star to post the review. It deserved no star."
4,What a Surprise!,"I took a chance on this movie, because I hadn't heard much about it, and boy am I glad! This movie was a fun adventure with Western flair that my whole family enjoyed."
2,"Poor story, bad script, bad acting, very slow, not really a western","I could not, or would not, watch this movie without the ability to watch and listen to it in fast forward. The story comes across to me like it was written by a high school student for a short story assignment. A very amateur story & dialogue. The story is a western only because it takes place in the late 1800's. The story could have been performed in any time period."
1,WHAT a disapointment,"With the likes of ""Seraphim Falls"" and the remake of ""3:10 to Yuma"", I had high hopes for this movie. DON'T EVER BOTHER!!! I don't know what most of the other people saw but they sure as heck was NOT watching this ""junk'! Bad acting, actors and just about everything else. The location was ok and if you take away the actors you would have an awesome movie.Great cover art, trailers and idea but the rest was just not good.For all you die-hard western movie watchers, don't even bother watching this unless you have a high dose of great westerns to watch to help wash the stink off of you because this movie STINKS!!!!"
1,whatever,"I'm a huge B2k fan or little fizz fan anyway but I can honestly say the only song I liked was Jhene-""Santa baby"" (And I'm not really a fan of hers) the rest was just bad and cheesey."
2,Was a fan,the only song that I like on there is santa Baby i think that is the best song. I think they should of work a little harder on the rest of the songs.
2,Funny & stupid at the same time.,"B2K as we known once as a popular R&B; group have got to fix this trash up because this album was nothing but for something to be laughing at and just to make fun of.The only reason that I am saying it is just that I know that I'm not a fan of B2K but,they should just quit trying to make something that ain't good for them.Better stick with The Gospellers instead."
5,Raising the Civil Dead,"Cathy Doyle (Spikes, Mikes, Slackers and Dykes) took me to see a screening of this extrordinary Austrailian produced film 15 years ago. The setting is a 'maximum security lockdown' in the middle of nowhere. Obviously, the theme is isolation. It's a classic. Performances by Nick Cave (The Bad Seeds) and Chris de Rose (Last Chance for Animals) are violently poetic. Leaving the lonely preview (Cathy, I and Wendy Hayes (Billy's wife) were the only attendees) , we shared a communal awe and agreed this was a rare treat, a 'one of a kind' experience. Cathy pitched, but both Bob and Harvey (Miramax) and Nelson Entertainment (Embasy) turned it down. It is available on DVD in Europe, but has not yet been released in the United States. I strongly recommend this disturbing film and urge a domestic DVD release."
4,"Crime and Punishment, the American Way","Here is a pretty gripping story of the modern world's standards after the fall of Christianity.""If there is no God, everything is permitted"".Probably not a masterpiece, but stays with you after you put down a book."
2,From the bizarre to the ridiculous,"This book reveals the most incredulous storyline I have ever read and believe me that says I lot becuase over the years I've read thousands of books. How could a mild-mannered, ordinary accountant be transformed into a thoughlessly cruel serial killer? How could his wife - a mother and seemingly kind and thoughtful person, time after time, condone his actions? It is a page turner because we want to see who he is going to kill next and what bizarre actions will follow-not because it is a well-written, positively thought-provoking read.Thumbs down x 5 for this one!!!!!!"
1,lame duck,"After reading The Ruines, this second book by Scott Smith, was a total failure. It was a total disappointment."
2,This book is preposterous and I hate it.,"The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a ""normal, good"" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along."
5,"Its written simply,powerfully,with shifting points of view.!","I don't like reading, but this book reads by itself. ""Warning"" Do not read A SIMPLE PLAN on a dark night if you are home alone.!"
3,Good read,"While A Simple Plan is not a great book, it provides a good read. The story moved along at a pretty good clip and kept my interest and provided good entertainment. Read it for fun and forget it. If you want something thought provoking or memorable, i suggest you look elsewhere."
2,a page-turner but gruesome and dismal,"A dismal gruesome tale of greed and stupidity. Although the writing style was engaging, the characters on the whole were not. The only truly sympathetic character was the dog Mary Beth."
3,You Can See Where the Author is Coming From,"I finished this book about an hour ago and while it is still fresh in my mind I would to comment on it. Basically, it is well written and an enjoyable read. I recommend it to anyone who likes thriller/suspence. The violence and brutality was overdone - but then in most American novels [and movies] it always is. It is what the public wants and what they get. Authors know this and remember their occupation is to sell books.One thing that became apparent to me while I was reading it was the emotional simalirity of this book with the rather long forgotten novel Teresa Raquin [sp?] written by Zola more than a century ago. The expression of guilt and survival seemed almost identical. I suspect that Scott Smith might have been influenced by this book."
3,"great book, they couldn't have made the movie without it","I had forgotten I had read this book. When we rented the movie, I became increasingly sure that it was something I had seen before. I saw the movie with my brother and the two of us began revealing developments to each other that convinced us both that we had read the book. That the screenwriters followed the book so carefully [rare these days] is a tribute to Mr. Scott's prose. The vivid images it conjured had convinced two of us that we had already seen a movie that we were both watching for the first time."
3,Entertaining but a little light,"I enjoyed this book. I found it, disappointly, light. Given the decisions the characters were facing, it could have been a much more substantive book."
2,"Exciting story, good development.","I read this book in just a few hours. After the first chapter I realized there was no need to read everything, so I mainly focused on the dialogue. It is an exciting plot and I enjoyed the little twists of fate which the author thought out quite well. However, I found the main characters' methodical planning and violent actions very disturbing, if not a bit unbelievable."
4,The slippery slope of crime illustrated!,"Scott Smith has written a twisted novel that serves as a warning to readers about the slippery slope of crime. What starts as ""A Simple Plan"" to retain found money turns into a very suspenseful psychodrama. The author aptly describes the seductive pull of big money, and the ever increasing repercussions of greed. His characters ring true until near the ending, as do their relationships. One reader caveat would be to be prepared for lots of people to die, as do in this first book from Scott Smith, and in his newest (see my review for The Ruins). By the end, I'd had enough death, and questioned if the author took it too far. But overall, this is a very interesting first novel and a gripping tale of a seemingly simple family man who, as Dr. Phil would say, digs himself a hole, then can't put down the shovel."
3,Great Book - Poor Ending!,"If this is Scott Smith's first book, the next/rest should be a lot better. This book starts out very well and carries the reader along, getting caught up in the web of greed and strange justification for wrong acts, but the end just left me amazed-it seemed like he was in a hurry to quit. I can think of several other ways to end this book that I think would have been better. The ending is the only part that really disappointed me. Still, it is a fast and easy read - you don't want to put it down. Worth the time to see how greed enables regular folks like you and me to do unbelievable acts of crimes, and yet find a sensible way to justify them!"
4,Masterpiece of understatement.,"The writing was excellent and the characters were not terribly likable. But that was the point. They were ordinary people who could never have dreamed of committing murder. The ending may be disppointing for some, but it is real life. There is no gripping conclusion. No living happily ever after. They just picked up their lives, had some normal hard times and went on living. HOWEVER, I kept wishing they would explore the option of ""laundering"" the money through a fence, like the professionals do! For that much money, big-time operators could probably have ""hacked"" into a system to find the numbers of the bills."
4,A simple plan of a book that falls apart in the last third.,"A Simple Plan is a great book -- up to the 2/3s point. The last 1/3 of the book falls apart, and does so quickly. It's too bad too, I really enjoyed the build up -- the ending is just a let down."
3,Nihilistic and somewhat depressing...,"There is no real point to this story except to expose the very worst in human nature. No good guys, just bad guys for whom the reader will have very little sympathy. Kept me turning the pages, but overall just made me feel depressed when it was over."
1,I just wanted this book to end.,"I feel the characters in this book were so unbelievable. There was no emotion involved in any of them. Sarah instructed her husband, Hank, to kill at the drop of a hat to save their skins. Here this woman has just delivered a baby and is so caught up her greed she doesn't give one thought to how her and her husband's actions will effect their newborn daughter. Every time there was a crisis Hank and Sarah came up with a plot to kill someone within minutes and carried it through without any forethought or remorse. The only thing I got out of the book was maybe O. J. Simpson could have been the ghost writer, because he is the only other person that could possibly have such little conscience as these two main characters."
1,I couldn't finish it.,"I managed to make it about three quarters of the way through A Simple Plan before giving up in disgust. I was truly incapable of caring less about this collection of cliched, selfish small town dorks. Maybe I'll watch the movie when its on cable, for free. I don't intend to read anything else by this author."
2,A simple mind,"I bought this book originally because it received a great review on NPR. Boy, what were they smoking? I can't remember a more unpleasant reading experience in a long time. There is no one in the book to like. The characters are simple minded and lacking in any real form of self awareness. Their behavior is inexplicable and stupid in the extreme. Given characters that one doesn't care about, the plot becomes irrelevant. One doesn't care what happens to them. Actually, one is only too painfully aware of what is going to happen, because these yahoos clearly can't think beyond the end of their noses.Very disappointing book."
2,"Good idea, weak story","A friend recommended this book to me, saying he thought the basic premise was pretty interesting. I have to agree with that much. The situation these characters find themselves in is indeed an interesting one. However, the story built around it is shallow and predictable. The main characters are simply too stupid to make this a plausible story. It is far too incredible and frustrating at times, which makes this a very tedious read. If you can, avoid this book and check out the movie instead...at least it's over in two hours."
2,"Had its thrills, but didn't deliver","The book started out with a great premise, but as it went along it was basically senseless murder and bloodshed. The characters didn't seem all that realistic to me because almost all of them handled cold blooded murder as if it was totally OK, as long as they got to keep the $4 million and didn't get caught.Yeah, it had its thrills and it was fun to read, but in the end, the characters were in the exact same position they were before they found the money. Nothing, when you think about it, happened, except for pointless murder.I personally think that this book was a waste of my time. There are a lot of better books out there that fall into this category. Read them instead."
1,"Tedious, violent, repetitive","The beginning is promising. As violence increases, so does boredom. A web of uncontrollable situations that never have a climax."
3,Twisted,I love how Scott Smith sets this up so that each decision the main character makes seems like the only good decision at the time. Yet each morally bankrupt decision leads to a darker and darker place.This book would be fantastic except the very ending is so hopelessly and relentlessly bleak. I felt like I'd been beat up for sympathizing with a character trying to improve his life. I'm sure that's what Smith was aiming for but it was just too much for me.
2,Smith gets it half right.,"I admire writers who put their characters in difficult situations, ones where they are not immediately ""likeable,""--and applaud writers who, despite these difficult circumstances, can create empathy (not to be confused with ""sympathy"") for those characters. Smith gets it half right. Yes, the situation is difficult, the protagonist morally bankrupt, but Smith fails miserably in his attempt to make us give a damn. Intentionally or not, this reader despised the protagonist (and pretty much everyone else involved in the ""plan"") from the moment he commits the first murder. The very weak rationale the protagonist (and Smith) supplies in an attempt to justify his extreme actions falls utterly flat in the face of murder. When a writer loses his readers so early in a long novel, he's got a major fight on his hands to win them back. Sadly, Smith loses."
5,A Simple Plan: Simply a great book!,"I am a 15 year old. I hate reading most books and they take me a long time to read. Not this book, though. Even though it was over 400 pages, I read the book in two days. You will be on the edge of you seat the whole time you are reading this book and you won't be able to put it down. I would recomend this book to all teenagers."
5,Best Thriller I've Read - Ever,"A SIMPLE PLAN and COLD MOUNTAIN, two of the best pieces of fiction I've laid eyes on - and both first novels! Scott Smith's characters made me literally angry at their mistakes, proof that I cared about them and what they did. Both books are journey pieces - one physical, the other psychological - with men as polarly opposite yet characteristically riveting as each other. Both books will be force-fed by me to friends un-read for years to come."
3,Not quite the gripping story I was lead to believe,"The cover of A Simple Plan states 'Simply the best suspense novel of the year' - Stephen King. Sorry, but I don't agree. A Simple Plan is, indeed, an excellent novel for a first-time author and it's certainly not a bad book, but it doesn't meet the standard to be called 'Simply the best suspense novel of the year'There are more deaths in this book than there are fish in the sea but the suspense fell away for most of the middle section of the story. Brief moments later on built some of it back again though generally I found it fairly flat."
1,"Not as good as the movie, by far","I couldn't stand to finish this book. I bought this book after watching the movie, and loving it, but the book took a completely different toll. The book started out great, until Hank went on a killing rampage. Sarah continued to egg him on, not seeming to care a wit about the death of Jacob. The ending was the worst yet. I thought it would be all over, Hank going home to burn the money, but he decided to claim a couple more victims. After the scene at Lou's house, I lost all respect for Hank, which I did have watching the movie. Maybe I'm just bitter watching the movie before reading the book."
1,A SIMPLETON'S PLAN would be a better title.,"Did the other reviewers read the same book that my husband and I did? NEVER have I read a book with such stupid characters, such a meandering plot, and such an idiotic ending."
1,completely devoid of entertainment,"Why this book became a best seller is beyond me. This has to be the worst book I've read in years. I plodded through hoping something interesting would happen but it just got more ridiculous and depressing. There were no twists, or anything that redeemed the initial plot idea. Hank is a weak, stupid, brutal, and boring one-dimensional character. I found myself hoping he would eventually get what was due him in some form betrayal, torture, death.. Unfortunately the end is just as boring and depressing leaving this reader throwing it in the trash."
1,Just Say No ~ It's That Simple,"I was looking forward to reading this book as the plot sounded really interesting. I managed to slog through one unredeeming chapter after another before finally finishing it. The plot was so absurd as to be laughable. The ""twist"" at the end was predictable from the very first chapters. And honestly, Hank and Sarah deserved everything they got in the end. The only sympathetic characters were the dog and the baby who, along with most every other character in the book, ended up in Hank's orbit of destruction. I actually thought about throwing the book away after finishing it but will donate it to a cancer charity bookstore. Hopefully, they will get a dollar for it which will be the only thing that will help save this from being a complete waste of time and energy."
1,ZzZzZz....had to force myself to read it,"i have to say this is literally the most boring book i've ever read. the plot is very simple. the author scott smith could have easily made the book 100 pages. he made, what should have been a short book, very long. i had to force myself to read the whole book. i saw so many good reviews of the book that i thought it was going to get better later on...boy was i wrong. he could have written that book in 25 pages probably. my god, i can't believe other readers rated this book so high. there are many other, waay better books out there. it deserves 1 star instead of zero only because i could finish the whole book. do yourself a favor, look past this book please..."
3,Story too predictable..,Definitely not a book to run out and get. Save this one for a rainly week. The entire story and ending was predictable. It took me too long to read.
1,DISGUSTING,"THIS BOOK WAS A WASTE OF TIME! SICK, BORING AND PREDICTABLE. THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK CHOSEN BY OUR NEWLY-FORMED BOOK CLUB AND ALL FIVE IN OUR CLUB FELT THE SAME WAY. INSTEAD OF HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME PUTTING THE BOOK DOWN, I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME PICKING IT UP TO FINISH IT. THE TWO, THREE, FOUR AND FIVE STAR REVIEWS AMAZE ME. ."
1,Read this book if you can not find your sleeping pills,"At the beginning of A Simple Plan, the book kept you reading more, but after Hank, Jacob, and Lou found the money, it became stupid and too long drawn out. After Hank's wife made him take back some of the money they found, it does not take a rocket scientist to know that he and his brother were asking for trouble. Common sense would have told a person, to never return to the scene of the crime. I was mad for wasting my time and energy in reading such a dull book."
3,A Simple Dark Story,"I can't say that I liked this book very much. It hardly seems like it was written by the same man as _The Ruins_. Although I suppose they were both books that basically consisted of one bad thing after another happening... I don't now. I thought that Smith did a good job of really getting into Hank's head, of justifying his motivations... but after what happened with Jacob, I just couldn't get reabsorbed into the story. It wasn't bad per se, but it certainly wasn't good! And the ending!!! Ach...."
3,"good, but","this is avery good book, but however this is one thing i could not ignore, there no way the cops could trace this all back to hank, mainly the one beack at the liquior store.Still, however a good read"
5,So much went wrong...,"I liked this movie, so I decided to buy the book. It was even better. The novel felt like a modern Shakespeare tale. The darkness just couldn't be stopped due to the greed of the people involved. The wife, coldly changing and directing from the back reminded me of Lady Macbeth, but in some ways worse. It's a simple story, but that doesn't mean boring, it's one of the best novels I've read in quite awhile."
5,Thin line between good and evil.,"The book starts out with a great intro, and from there there is no stopping to the madness. I like it when an uather takes the human condition to its extreme. How suddenly killing would be so easy compesation to our securities. how our inner dysfunctional conflict are burried deep with and would only arise for the most superficial thing on earth, in this case:MoNY.A lot of people will be skeptical. But it is a one of a kind thriller looking at people with a chance to change and reach their high castle dreams over night, discovering that it is not about the source of change. It is about who they really are.The line between good and evil is really thin.Great book."
4,More dramatic ending needed,"I was blown away by this book. Very dark and evil. However, because it was so evil, I really wanted it to have an ending to make it truly demonic. The ending was good, but I wanted more tragedy out of the end result. I almost expected a dual suicide similar to the way Hanks parents died, only inculding their daughter. THAT would have been more dramatic than the ending it had, although it does make you really evaluate your life."
4,Pulled me through in two sittings!,"Overall this book is a great read. The unexpected twists and turns kept me reading anxiously. It gave me a dark and overcast feeling the entire time I read it, which is obviously the sign of a good writer. Strangely enough I found this book after reading The Ruins, and I must say this is much better. The only reason I couldn't give it a full 5 star rating is that there was overall an element of unrealistic character development. The baser side of mankind was truly explored, but I cannot see how a man who has no history of violence suddenly becomes a robotic killer and his wife just goes along with it like it is a part of his job. The lack of compassion and total self preservation is something I hope isn't common just because money is the end result. BUT, don't let that stop you from reading this book. It is worth the few hours invested."
4,made me think,"I read this book a few years ago and let a friend borrow it, and I have not seen it since! I loved the book. It really made me think about human nature and what would I do if I found scads of money. I would hope I would do the right thing, but never say never. I thought this book was very well thought out and executed, details very precise, but a little on the gory side. I did enjoy it."
2,Kelsius missed the mark...,"The beach chair felt flimsy and cheap. The canopy straps were attached in such a way as to make it look way lopsided when attached to the chair. Was that designed in? Also the tear-down was not user-friendly although yes it was easy to figure out, just not very convenient. All in all, a disappointment for me."
1,"Might have been nice, but Amazon couldn't get it together","I ordered this chair twice, and both times Amazon failed to send the UV canopy with the chair. I eventually sent both chairs back. I did use one of the chairs at the beach and found it to be rather uncomfortable. The sling design is kind of cool, but you end up sitting right at the front edge of the chair. It might be different on a hard surface, but on the sandy beach, it wasn't all that great."
4,Pretty good chair,"This chair is sturdy and easy to set up. It's lower to the ground than I thought it was going to be, so sometimes it is hard to get up from. The shade is huge, so if you are planning to use the chair at an outdoor concert/event, plan to sit behind everyone else or way off to the side (otherwise you'll hear the complaints from people behind you!). We've used them at little league games and will take them to the beach this summer."
3,OK product,"It's ok for a person with an average weight of 135 lbs to 150 lbs. I am 135 lbs and it's small for me. The 2 shoulder straps that converts into arm rest are pretty weak and almost torn out when I put pressure on it. I am ok with the product, not so happy not so disappointed."
2,Useless canopy,"The chair is way too small for a grown adult. The canopy worked the first day, but not the second day. It flopped forward on to the chair for some reason. Others may have had a working canopy but mine is an epic fail."
2,Not so much.....,"These chair are too low to the ground, too tippy and the shade is too flimsy.I wouldn't buy them again, but expect I'll get 2 or 3 years of service from them."
1,Improper product description,"This item was made for Kelsyus in TWO(2) colors, blue and stone. Color was not mentioned in the description at all !! The item was ordered hoping it was STONE. The item arrived, blue. The chair was returned for credit and I took the hit for a reduced credit because you people thought it was my error that it was returned. Moral of the story: NEVER assume that Amazon can describe products accurately !! Future purchases at Amazon will be made only after alternative sources have failed. It makes one wonder what ever happened to integrity Amazon once had !"
1,"Nice design, terrible execution",This thing is junk. Looks nice and sleek but is really poorly built with plastic at critical areas. Broke on first use.
4,Lightweight and easy to transport.,The chair is really comfortable and lightweight. It is easy to take to and from the beach and is pretty small in regard to packing it. The UV canopy cannot be used by a tall person though....it just doesn't work if you are over 6'ft.
3,Chair Ok but Canopy Oil-spilled!,I was really looking forward for the delivery of my order and could not wait to open the box when it finally arrived. The chair is a neat little gadget; a little too low for my liking. The canopy had oil spill that my family could not stand the oil smell.Amazon sent a replacement shipment which also came with similar oil spilled canopy. Is this a factory assembly gone wild; with no quality control? I have never experienced anything like this before!
1,Women of Destiny Bible,This was not the Bible I ordered.The seller sent me a Women of Destiny Journal not the Bible I had reviewed.I was very disappointed
5,Fishpond Firehole Tippet Gage review,"Very handy item especially if you build your own fresh or saltwater leaders. Also handy if you need to repair a leader on the water, after a fish broke you off, and you need to know what size leader material to tie back on. Very well built and available in numerous brite colours to aid in finding it should you and it become seperated. The predrilled hole in the Gage is designed to make attaching it to a zinger easy. Use this feature and the chance of losing it in the water is greatly reduced. A very durable, quality product from fishpond."
5,You don't have to love his movies to enjoy this!,"I certainly enjoy classic poetry, but I also enjoy parody and fun poetry. This short book has some absolutely hysterical poems, and many of them parallel the classics. The title poem is actually making a great point about how the reckless people in life force the rest of us to yield to their desires.The more bizarre/extreme works in the collection might offend some people, but if you have a good sense of humor and don't get upset easily, then you'll certainly enjoy this work.A quick story: I brought this book into school and passed it around the English department ... almost everyone found a poem to read aloud, and we all had fun discussing them. The consensus favorite was the poem ""Reunion,"" where Coen perfectly hits what goes on at the 10, 20, or 25 year high school reunion. Pick this up and pass it on ... you'll laugh at the least."
1,Can't download,"We can order dozens of books about franchising, but the one digital item we want to buy has a geographical restriction on it. Why? Lame. There is nowhere on the item page that states it cannot be downloaded outside the US so I just wasted my time trying to buy it. Nice, no wonder there are no reviews for it. If you are the author, find out why it cannot be purchased outside the states, or continue missing out on your hard-earned royalties."
3,It is too much in some places,"I only bought this CD because it was about $1.50 for a used one on Amazon. I was interested to see what it sounded like, which the first half of the CD was alright. However, starting from ""He's got the look"" it went down hill a couple of levels. I must admit I really don't even listen much to the second half, and in fact I just finished listening to the second half to verify my thoughts. I'm sorry but it is as I remembered not very good in some cases, especially the off key ""Whatever Happens"". Overall, Vanessa Williams does have a beautiful voice and she can really sing, but this CD just is not, for me, very good. Now if you want to take a major step up into a better vocal and song selection, then Vanessa's next CD ""The Comfort Zone"" is one to get. Every song on her second album is good and on Amazon it is cheaper than this OK CD."
5,Nice Debut!!!!,"This is a nice album I like it I enjoy it and it contains some nice songs. I like dreamin', the right stuff, and Darlin I, I enjoy Vanessa's work she can sing, dance, and act. And she is beautiful also she has won awards for her work . This is a nice cd and a must have for any Vanessa Williams fan."
5,A voice as smooth as silk......,"All these years later and I still enjoy this cd. I think that Vanessa surprised lots of people when she proved that she could sing and then as time went on she proved that she had ""staying power"" and was not a one or two hit wonder. I love all of the songs but favs are The Right Stuff,Dreamin'and Darlin' I. I would recommend this cd to anyone, you will not regret it."
5,Quite good,"I thought this might be an interesting documentary but was very pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the dramatizations. The Hoover Dam and Brooklyn Bridge segments complimented, rather than duplicated, other documentaries I'd seen and the London sewer episode- which I thought would be a snore- was fascinating. I'm eagerly hoping there will be a volume 2."
3,Eh,Its beautiful music. But not very graceful and there were quite a few mistakes. If you are buying it to watch an old man play it is impressive.... if you want to hear beautiful music played beautifully and recorded so you feel like you are there in person... Try Kristian Zimmerman.
4,Istanbuls greatest band,"The first cd is even better!its called psy-belly dance and is produced by the mad proffessor like this new 2 nd cd..Guest musicians on this 2 nd cd include alexander Hacke (einsturzende neubauten)Its feel good music...strangely exotic...sometimes almost eroticly beautifull rock mixed with dub,club,bellydance and psychedelic cramps guitars and many other instruments.Higly recommended!I ll give the 1 st cd a 9 out of 10 and duble organtal an 8 out of 10A must have!Go and watch them live!!!!"
2,Story is all over the place...,"It's a good ""diversion"" for a quick read, but not nearly as good as The Straw Men. Definitely read this if you liked the first novel, but be warned that Michael Marshall is trying too hard to make a franchise out of The Straw Men. I can't really fault Michael Marshall for the effort to be like Nora Roberts or Jeffrey Deaver, but this novel just isn't very well coceived and lacks congruity. This novel really has two competing storylines that just don't work together (read it, see if you agree). Ward Hopkins is a compelling character. His rants and diatribes about society and the world alone are worth reading this book (I'd give his observations 4 out of 5 stars). Not a ""page turner"" like the first novel..."
4,STRAW MEN REDUX,"This sequel to Marshall's weird STRAW MEN is complex, oftentimes confusing, and a little slow at times; however, it continues its tale of a secret society of killers who feel civilization is not worth saving, with enough surprises and twists to keep you going. The leading characters of Ward Hopkins and Nina are given a little more depth this time, and the Upright Man himself pulls off some neat trickery. The subplot involving a bigfoot and a nice old lady are muddled, and not fully resolved at the end, either. The presence of Tom Kozelek as a man bent on committing suicide also tends to cloud the central plot.However, most of these subplots and twists come together in a susspenseful showdown in the snowy mountains of Washington state. Marshall also suggests a possible third entry in this unusual, if sometimes frustrating, series."
2,Murky and confusing,"The first thing about ""The Upright Man"" that any prospective buyer should know is that it's a SEQUEL! This is not mentioned anywhere on the book cover; I had absolutely no idea about that when I picked up this book on a whim. The author makes almost no allowances for this; he simply assumes that you've read the first book. It becomes very confusing when characters make cryptic, fragmentary references to the events in the earlier volume.Marshall is undoubtedly a talented writer; he has a good ear for dialogue and his social observations are interesting. However, that's the best I can say about this novel. There are too many characters and the point of view is constantly shifting. Marshall also includes some digressions that seem to go nowhere, such as a lengthy subplot about Bigfoot (!). By the time I slogged through to the big finale, in which characters are staggering around a dark forest shooting at each other, I didn't know (or care) who the ""bad guys"" were anymore."
1,A TERRIBLE Sequel,"The prequel, The Straw Men, was as Stephen King said: ""A masterpiece"".This one is boring, it has the cheesiest ending I've ever read, nothing is clarified at the end, and the reader is left feeling confused and irritated."
2,Violet and unfocused,"I was 20 pages from the end of the book and just couldn't bring myself to finish. I found myself picking up the book every day as if it was a homework assignment nd checking page numbers almost constantly. For a spooky read, check out Richard Laymon instead."
1,Not very humid.,I bought this product for my sons room and had the thing only two days before we were back out shopping for a new one. In two full days of constant use this 'humidifier' did not lower the water level in its reservoir but maybe 5%. Save your money and get your self a humidifier that works!
2,unimpressed,"I wouldn't recommend this. Despite what these diehard synthpop afficionadoes might say, I didn't find a single track with a hook worth listening to twice. Although the music is well put together and excellently produced, the melodies are mostly cloying and always unremarkable, attempts at new romantic opera that seem to have no musical knowledge backing them up -- exactly the opposite of catchy. The vocalist sounds like he phoned in his performance from a tanning booth. As someone who likes Covenant, Soviet, Cosmicity, etc. I still found myself thinking that ESH was just a little too soulless and half-hearted: compared to the Pop Robot tracks, even the most reserved Erasure song sounds like hair metal."
4,Dark City Zone (translated from Russian),"'Pop Robot' (Ninthwave)****Conceptual artists not only exist in Rock/Metal, but also in Electro-pop. Irish Trio Empire State Human have created this conceptual album, telling of the adventures of a POP ROBOT. ESH combine different elements of Deep House, Ambient Electronica & Modern Synthpop. Whilst adding 7 bonus tracks from their debut disc, resulting in over 75 minutes on CD. That's the priciple of 'value for the money' in action!...AH.K."
4,Impressive Electro-pop,"""Pop Robot"" is a very strong album from Empire State Human. Given its price and the fact that the CD has twenty-one tracks, it's also an excellent value, doubly so in that the CD does not become tiresome with repeated listens. It stays fresh and interesting, and is definitely one of the best synthpop albums I've bought in a while. Fans of synthpop will recognize a range of influences on ""Pop Robot,"" like Kraftwerk and early Human League, but the album does not sound at all dated. Some of my favorite songs are Paralyzed, I Work for the Government, Eastern Lights and Apollo. I would definitely recommend this CD to any fan of electro-pop."
3,"TO MUCH EVERYTHING , VERY LITTLE ESH","I'm giving this cd a 3 star rating for the simple fact that I still can not place the group, the music or the direction that they want to take in any place. There is way to much ERASURE, THE SHAMEN & HUMAN LEAGUE and not very much ESH. Lyrics at times come in as cheesy and way to pop and the high pitch voice of the main singer does not help at all. This would have sound great back in the 80's but it sounds hilarious now in days. I will say that if they have made an album based on the format of tracks 5, 6,7, 8 and 10 the cd would have been much better. There are some great melodies don't take me wrong, but, once the singing starts... it's just kills the momentum."
1,Don't use it for a Delorme PN series GPS,"This one-star rating applies only for someone who's buying the Lenmar CRV3 to use in a Delorme PN series GPS unit. The Lenmar battery's casing is thick enough to make the battery fit too tightly in the unit. It wouldn't take long before forcing the battery in, and then trying to pry it out, would damage the unit or the battery. Or both. In addition, it's difficult to get a good fit on the battery cover when screwing it down. Moisture is likely to get behind the cover. I sent the Lenmars back to Amazon and bought a pair of CRV3 batteries from Delorme. A little more expensive, but they fit well and nothing will be damaged."
2,Won't recharge,"Like other people, I also couldn't get this battery to recharge, albeit I didn't try buying other chargers so the one I had might not have been compatible (although it was specifically for this kind of battery), I wouldn't waste your money!"
5,Loved it!,Perfect is correct! Few people know the difference between a teaspoon and a spoon for tea! Well built and the service was excellent!
4,a lot for us to learn,"This is an awesome book. I am not an anthropologist and so cannot comment on its research methods etc. I can, however, attest that this book articulated a strongly post-colonial viewpoint and made me think deeply about the way we live in ""developed"" countries. The anthropological information is constructed around Maybury-Lewis's story of living with the Xavante people, and this biographical aspect of the book's construction helps to engage readers further with the ideological orientation of the text. I loved the photographs, the inserts about various historical writings on anthropological issues. My favourite part of the book is when David and his family witness a ""log race"" whilst living with the Xavante - we witness the beauty of a life lived without pointless competition and egotism. Maybury-Lewis' book is one of my favourite resources and I re-read it regularly for spiritual and intellectual respite."
5,I cooka Gourmet Sicilian dishes now!,"My wife & I watched Nick Stellino on Channel 8 in Az. We bought both of his cook books, best Sicilian style receipes ever found! We love them, Nick makes them a real pleasure as cooking should be, the Tiramisu is outstanding, the compiments are endless,delcious, best ever eaten!"
1,disappointed,"Well, I have the book and am not thrilled. I enjoy a ""little"" chat. However, Nick really goes overboard, I think. Some of the recipes are okay; but none thrill. Perhaps I just bought the wrong Nick Stellino book. I know quite a few recipes in this book already and others I'm not interested in trying. *sigh* ""My Mother's Southern Kitchen"" by James Villas is a totally different cuisine but his book is simply wonderful. Amazon sent it out right away when I ordered. I have made three recipes from it already. It is charming with just about the right amount of chat ( not much )."
1,Can't recommend this book,"I was so disappointed in this book. I don't find a closeness to God in the pages. Instead it seems intellectual. It contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with God face to face. Even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal God I seek. And though the author's prayers are included too, I feel the same about them. I expected more from Richard J. Foster."
3,Solid but not startling,"Recorded at a time when Fairport Convention were a fixture on the London hippy scene and the closest they'd got to folk-rock was listening to Bringing It All Back Home, the band's debut album nevertheless contains the seeds of what was to come. In comparison with their later, exemplary work, it's solid but not startling. Both Ian Matthews and Judy Dyble's vocals are rather weak (Ian's voice became stronger through the years); and Joe Boyd's production is on the thin side compared to the richness we usually expect from him. On the other hand, the perfectly balanced guitar team of Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol is already in place; Richard's gift for songwriting is on display; and the band's choice of cover versions is inspired. Best tracks? The chugging run through Emmitt Rhodes' Time Will Show The Wiser; the obscure Dylan track Jack O' Diamonds; and the jazzy blues of It's Alright Ma, It's Only Witchcraft. Dated, but oddly likeable, and well worth a listen."
1,If I could I would rate it a 0 star,"This is one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. The characters, especially the two main actors, have no common sense, no brains. This story is about lies, betrayal, selfishness. It justifies all these values in the name of love. Is that true love? The real victim in this whole film was the poor fiancée who had no idea that his girlfriend, Gabriela, was a total whore. How could anyone trust as woman who changes her mind ever 5 min?. I felt absolutely disgusting after the film. It's not romantic, its definitely not a love story, not exiting, intelligent, nothing, It offers nothings. It's cheap and I wasted my money by renting it. The only good acting in the film was by Lupe Ontiveros. She deserved more scrip time. So, please do not buy this film unless your into ghetto, cheap, lust stories."
1,Density Filter,The filter does not work well at all. You can not even see the shading on it when you take the picture! I am not happy at all with it but my husband wont let me send it back he said that it would be a waste of time so I guess I will not be able to order anything else from them again.
4,Booh hoo hoo hoo! *sniff* (Emotion!),"Emotion's one of my favorite stations from GTA Vice City, and Fernando is hilarious! But the choice of 1 or 2 songs for the soundtrack irritate me a little... Where did they dig up ""Wow""? I cringed when I first heard it! I'm not too crazy about ""Sister Christian,"" but it was pretty popular back in the days (wouldn't know, cuz I was way too into ""Jem"" at the time) :) Wonder why Journey or Duran Duran wasn't chosen?"
1,Worst Movie I Ever Saw,"I just remember these babes running into battle in slow motion wearing hats with bouncing ear flaps. And an ending where long-dead warrior zombies (the baddie's new army) carry off beautiful maidens to ravish, the heroes defeat the baddie with the help of about 6 farmers and their animals, nobody rescues the maidens, the bad guy isn't really dead (magical rules) and the winsome young hero gets both twins. Somebody tell me I misremembered.Sample of dialogue?Grizzled Warrior to Twins: ""Will you give your family to the fire or to the earth?""Twins: ""To the fire. It is our way."""
3,Not for everyday use,"First, this model had all the features I needed: Auto Reverse, (automatic), A backlit button, and megabass. However, in Amazon's description it said it included a clock function. Not true. The Battery case is difficult to access as you have to open the cassette door., plus Sony's poor design continues with the headphone jack on the bottom of the walkman. Thus, you can NOT stand the unit upright on a table, etc. The 4 way knob is difficult to operate, and you have to look at the display to see if you are either rewinding fast-fowarding or playing. Thus, design I give it 2 stars, and it's features 3 stars."
5,Sometin Sometin.....,Cool Track boyz.... Check out Eminems dirty dozen. They throw the best hook of the summer in a 62.6 BPM reggae like track... Talking about drugz and hoz. What else is there??? Wicked...
5,superb book,"I heard Professor Nielsen on NPR last week, purchased the book, and I really enjoyed it. The quotes from real people about their experiences with offensive public speech really illuminate how it feels to be in public for people of different social groups and how it differs.Professor Nielsen's insights about legal consciousness are innovative. She convincingly demonstrates how different people have different experiences with the law which lead to different expectations about the law and its capacity to solve social problems. This book is a must read for students in sociology, women's studies, legal studies, etc. You will both enjoy it and learn from it -- a rare combination in academic writing."
2,It's just so-so for me.,"I've used the product for about a month. It gets and stays warm, so I know it's there, but it doesn't really do much for my arthritis pain. However, there's not much that does, but I keep trying."
3,Para aprender lo basico,"Este libro nos muestra algunos proyectos que supuestamente pueden ayudarnos en nuestra tarea con Photoshop. Debo decir que el libro esta orientado a principiantes y en ese punto cumple con su objetivo. No pidamos mas. Va de menor y a mayor ; y sus guias son exactas, pero no reveladoras. Solo para principiantes."
5,Very informative,"This is a great book, very informative but simple and quick to read. Has real pictures which make it so much easier to identify the herbs and sums up the plant and its properites too."
4,Great visual help,"I bought the Smithsonian Handbook of Herbs because of it's exceptional picture helps to identify herbs. I have used the Peterson's Field Guide which has better written information and more herbs, but pictures are small and only in one stage of the herbs cycle. The Smithsonian Handbook for the most part shows the Herb from flowering to the seed stage, leaf formation and the whole plant, flower - fruit - seeds etc. In summary a very good visual help."
2,Unispired,"I usually loves Dilbert, but this book did not reach the high standard as I am used to with Scott Adams. It seems the stories never really folds out into the known and loved, Dilbert surreallity. Pointy Haired Boss as engineer is grest fun though."
4,Fighting the daily grind,"Adams does it again. One wonders where he keeps finding all the ideas, and they are so right on. Dilbert plods his way through seemingly useless existence lost in cubic space while his dog and garbage man seem much wiser. Wally never does any work, and we learn of the ""Wally period"" where you wait to begin a project in case it is cancelled. Dogbert sells nuclear warheads to the Elbonians and pointy hair brings in a man-hating feminist to harass the troops. Catbert the evil HR director thinks up new ways to torment employees. Classic Dilbert at its best. Send a copy to your own pointy haired boss for any occasion."
2,O.K But repeats,After reading the reviews I was excited to recieve this book. But when I got it I found that all the strips were old ones I had read before in other collections. Unfortunalty there is not much new material in this book.
3,Ventriloquism at its best,"As a boy, I loved Paul Winchell and company. However, I was probably too young to see this version when it originally aired. I think Mr. Winchell is about the best ventriloquist I've ever seen. The main thing that made me rate this 3 stars rather than more was the barrage of commercials for Tootsie Rolls. It was built into the skits and even some of the costumes. If you can overlook that, you can still appreciate Paul Winchell's talent both with the ventriloquism and his creativity. A better choice would be Stop, Look, and Laugh a feature film released around 1960. It showcases winchell's talent interspersed with portions of Three Stooges episodes. Much more fun !"
2,Mediocre annotated Bible,"JVI and his wife are marketing geniuses. With her soft, broken voice of adoration for her husband, she could sell ice to the eskimos. Over priced, personal interpretation of Scriptures, leaves a lot to be desired. Dispensational, pre trib, and bad at it...DONT LET YOURSELF BE FOOLED BY THESE MERCHANTS OF THE WORD OF GOD. THEY ARE OUT THERE TO PROMOTE A VERY DARK AGENDA. ASK FOR THEIR FINANCIAL BOOKS AND CHECK WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING BEFORE BUYING THIS BADLY PUT TOGETHER ABERRATION OF OUR HOLY BOOK. THINK OF WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM DISARTICULATING CHRISTIANITY! MAY GOD GRANT YOU DISCERNMENT!"
3,Group in desparate need of singer/lyricist!!!,"This group is talented in every respect except in vocals. Arne Schafer would do very well to stick to the guitar and find a new vocalist. His voice turned me off faster than any I have ever heard. As if his voice wasn't bad enough, the choice of lyrics for this piece of work was terrible. If I had the equipment to do it, I would remove the vocals from this CD and be very satisfied with the remains. Listen closely before you buy."
1,Not what I expected,"My daughter was real excited when Santa brought this toy, but was very disappointed that it didn't do what she expected. She played with it about 10 minutes at the most and now its in the closet. The scanner scans the codes but when it tells you what you've scanned its always the wrong item. The microphone doesn't work unless you are right up on it and the pad where you sign you name doesn't work at all. Not worth the money."
3,Great for Research,This was a great book. It is a wonderful opportunity to read for research on this particular area. I thoroughly enjoyed this as many others I interviewed did also. Buy this book...it's a good read!
1,Weak and Drawn out,"A friend reccomended this book, so I read it. He said it had really been changing his faith.Personally this book scares me, not because I think Jesus is mean or wild, but because this book really stretchs verses and implies to much. I been struggling reading threw it. I feel like he points to extremist as examples of what Jesus wants. I dont think that we should abandon are family and sell their stuff just to give to the church.Personally I would not recommend this book."
1,Whitewash,"What? Jesus curses a fig tree for not bearing fruit out of season or calls a mother seeking help for her child a dog? No worries. It's all good, a kindness don't you see. I believe a miracle is in order here. It's not so much turning water into wine, but the venom of brutish, nasty behavior into the milk of human kindness. Why start thinking now? To say it is to make it so!Once you throw reason out the window, you can let pretty much anything in the door.This is how faith evolves with timeAnd the sun turns even as your mind"
4,"Quirky but good, like everything about OpenBSD","First - I like the book and I think anyone wishing to get a better grasp on OpenBSD administration should have it, and should have Absolute OpenBSD and Secure Architectures with OpenBSD as well.The portions directly about building firewalls and about configuring pf are great, but the book suffers from its attempt to be all things to all people. Chapter 2 is a truncated version of something from ""Building Internet Firewalls"" by Zwicky, et. al. Chapter 3 and most of Chapter 4 could have been left to a more general administration guide. The rest is dynamite. There is in-depth coverage of NAT, CBQ and bandwidth shaping, and authpf. If you are building a firewall of any complexity, this book is a must have."
2,Not as pictured,Item is not as robust as pictured. Have not tried to solve it because it is a present for another. Actual item seems quite flimsy and may not survive the first attempt to solve it. The item includes a pictured solution. The solution does not appear to apply to the actual item delivered because of difference in manufacturing.
2,Midland 74-250 weather radio,"The Midland 74-250 weather radio is good choice for weather alerts while pursuing outdoors activities as it has many alerts and the S.A.M.E.(Specific Area Message Encoding) feature, but keep in mind some negatives:When I purchased mine, It was listed as having rechargable batteries and a wall charger. It apparently no longer comes with it. From the Midland web site (an older page):""Includes:Alarm ClockDigital ThermometerDigital Clock9 Programmable S.A.M.ERechargeable BatteriesWall Charger""and from the FAQ:""Q. What charger for the 74-250 Handheld Weather Radio?Ans. 200 Milliamp 6volt charger, and please make sure that the plug fits the jack.""Midland does not list a charger.The radio loses the date and time when the batteries are changed, but it keeps the county code.Programming is difficult, keep the manual handy.Both alarms are turned on when the batteries are changed.It requires a coin or similar item to open the battery door."
3,Great for emergency -- but of no use as a warning monitor,"Like others have said, this radio performs poorly with respect to battery life. The display is good, reception is fine, but put it in warning mode where it is just listening for alerts and batteries are lucky to make a week. The controls are not hard to use but the quality is poor and I have buttons that stick on occasion. So, you need something to dump in an emergency backpack for use after an emergency this is great but if you want to monitor for events you want wall power combined with batteries."
2,"Poor audio, poor directions",I was able to program the radio despite the confusing directions in the manual. I live in a city where the weather alerts are broadcast and the reception is very very poor. You can not hardly understand what is being said. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this to my worst enemy.
2,Works well but tak a pass on purchase,"This unit is difficult to set up as the functions are not at all intuitive. Once set up it performs well but battery life is short lived, about a week at most. After changing batteries you have to redo the complete setup again. There is an external battery charger port for rechargable batteries but no mention of how to purchase a charger.There are other units that are user friendly w/ chargers in the same price range. Purchase one of them."
1,Don't buy this Radio,"Living here in Maine weather counts and moves fast. Unlike those in the Midwest at least we do not have tornados. Thank goodness because the best thing this radio would be good for, in that part of the country, would be throwing it into the wind and hope that it's poor quality would come back and kill you cleanly. Why? Because a radio with dead batteries that is almost impossible to program is much less useful than all of our basic senses, sight, sound etc, so if you counted on the radio you would hope a clean exit from this world.If you want a radio that will help you make life and death decisions don't buy this one unless you have pockets full of batteries, the manuel and internet access. This radio will never go into the wilderness with me.My best from Maine"
2,"Hard to use, hard on batteries","This unit is difficult to program, and the buttons are hard to press. What may be the worst though is that battery life is very poor in the ""alert"" mode. The Midland units that run on AC power (with battery backup) are somewhat better, but still difficult to use."
4,Weather Radio,"I bought the Midland to replace an Oregon Scientific that would not trigger on SAME alerts. As a member of SkyWarn, I need to get alerts when they happen.I like the radio. It has a good feel and the weight is right. The nain push switch (on / off / speaker on/off / monitor) takes some getting used to. I keep it next to the bed at night and changing modes requires both hands. The set up was easy and the directions were easy to follow. I am thinking about getting the base unit for my Ham radio room."
3,Midland 74-250C SAME Handheld Weather Alert Radio,"Functions perfectly but operating system is very unintuitive, must consult owner's manual often, and even that is poorly written. Battery life not great, should look for AC adapter soon."
3,"Besides a few issues, a very good weather radio!","I received this as a gift over 11 years ago and it still works reliably. Most recently it has begun to chew through batteries quicker, so it could be aging a bit now. It does allow for rechargeable batteries and comes with a recharging plug, though. Could be more user friendly for beginners, but once you know how to program it, it becomes second nature. I guess one could look at the complicated programming issues as a good thing in that your settings wouldn't be easily messed up by inadvertent button pushing.Nevertheless, the unit gets great reception and is one of the better weather radios I have come across."
3,"Good for what I paid for I paid for it, You - not so much","I ended up getting this from Walmart on clearance a few years back for $10. It was a good bargain at that price. I wouldn't have spent any more money than that honestly for this radio, it's just hard to deal with. Reasons are -1) Battery door is a pain to get off without using a coin. But, if you do use a coin it can mar the plastic.2) Alarms are default on & it's a pain to shut them off.3) It's difficult to figure out how to set the SAME codes and, when you do, rarely will they activate. I brought this thing to my work because we were in a tornado warning. Not ONCE did it beep off or even blink. My other radio had been activated earlier that day.4) And the volume - the speaker is iffy when on full volume. The louder it gets the more distorted the voices sound. Bad enough the weather band voices are computer generated, when it gets distorted you can't understand it without turning the volume down."
3,It Works,"After a near miss by a Tornado, I was looking for a Weather Radio. I read enough reviews to look for the SAME feature, and even read some of the reviews of this radio. After buying the unit, I went back over the reviews and the most telling one I found was one that mentioned this was a good product for $20. I would agree! Since it costs $40, need I say more? As mentioned, this product does not come with a charger or rechargable batteries. You can't even find the ratings for a charger (I did find that in a review). My biggest complaints are the commonly mentioned short battery life (even in ""clock only"" mode), and the fact there is NO VOLUME controls. Also be aware this product is dicontinued by the manufacturer reducing a lot of information that is available about it."
2,"It works, but...","this is just about the most user-unfriendly radio I've ever encountered. Programming is anything but intuitive, and battery life is fair to poor. I have to keep the manual attached to it to be able to use the darn thing."
1,Other sources needed to stay alive,"This radio is great if you have a t.v. or internet to get your alerts. If the speaker is on, it'll tell you there is a warning. If not, good luck. The warning doesn't scroll across the screen and the light won't flash red like it says. Our whole state is in a blizzard warning, my light flashes green and it says there is no message! If you need a radio to stay alive, this is not the one to get."
3,poor instructions,the instructions were very complicated. if i had been previe to the instructions before buying i would not have purchased this item.
3,Interesting Read,"An interesting rather than a great read. Not so much a 'whodunit' more a how are Riley and Frank going to get out of this.Some nasty villains, which is always good in a crime novel, but Riley made a few too many bad or silly decisions, which is always frustrating in this genre."
5,Totally cool. The Lee Legends continue to be the best.,"Brandon Lee won the newcomer award in Hong Kong for his portrayal of a guy plagued with adversity, but a passionate will to overcome. Bruce Lee had advised his followers to ""try again,"" but by being his son, Brandon had no alternative but to ""try harder."" His Hong Kong martial arts style demonstated in Legacy of Rage is without equal."
2,might be for you,"I bought this after reading some of the other reviews and I must say I'm a little disappointed. I like Brandon Lee, and I like martial arts movies. But this movie really was more of an 80s action flick than a martial arts movie. The plot line and acting weren't bad for a movie in this genre. Fairly formulaic. And the dubbing is something that you are probably used to if you watch many hong kong movies. But the actual fight scenes tended to be very short, and involved a little too much gun play for what I was hoping was more martial art oriented. Over all I was kinda underwhelmed. If you are just a huge Brandon Lee fan and must own everything he acted in then by all means enjoy. But this definitely isn't on par with the Crow, Rapid Fire, or even Showdown in Little Tokyo."
5,good product,"from the beginning to the end of this movie was pretty simple, but If you are Bruce lee's Fans, you got to watch this movie becauce you would see Bruce's smile in Brandon lee's face."
2,Don't by it on its own,Waste of money if you don't have the actual theory book. Most of the cases are summary and result of strategy. It doesn't really tell how strategy was implemented
5,"Great quality, great fun!",Schleich's quality is unmatched for the price. Don't bother looking for another fence for your child's horse collection. Schleich is better than Melissa and Doug and Breyer as well. I am always bowled over by the level of quality for the price. This fence is such a fun addition to my 6 year old daughter's play time. It is so nice to hear the stories that she and my 10 year old come up with while playing with their horses instead of the drama that comes with playing with Barbies. Keep the Schleich coming Amazon!!
5,Excellent product,"This was ordered as a Christmas present for my granddaughter. The Schleich name carries with it a certain reputation of quality. I was not dissappointed. Everything about the fence was perfect, and better then it looked in the picture. My granddaughter has several Schleich horses, and I know she will have a great time using this fence.I reccommend this product to anyone."
1,Hmm...,I have no review for this product because it **never** showed up. Not even after I contacted the company - the Vitamin Shoppe - and asked what had happened.
4,Unjustly ignored until after the Woodstock movie came out,"Richie Havens/ Mixed Bag: This album was released in 1967 but was a poor seller until after Richie was seen (two years later) at Woodstock. This is a very nice album. Richie has a rich and unique voice which is always a joy to hear. Although this falls short of being a five star album, it is certainly worth having and enjoying."
4,Classic Havens!!,"If you dig the sound of Haven's soulful voice over smooth guitar, then this CD is for you! I love it!"
3,Pretty comfy...but narrow hips beware,"This is overall a fairly comfortable thong. But the ""one size"" label (which specifically means sizes 4-14) is a tad misleading. I'm small in the butt and hips, and usually wear a size 4 (5'4"" and 120 lbs). There's a lot of extra fabric in the front panel and it bunches in a pretty unflattering way (camel toe, anyone?). There's also a bit more fabric than I'd like in the actual thong part, so that's not especially comfortable. If no one else is seeing them, I suppose it's not that big a deal. But if you're on the petite side, you may have better luck with a lace thong that comes in an actual ""S"" size (there are lots out there that are even more comfortable than Hanky Panky)."
3,Second Best,"The 4911 is alright, but not as well fitted as it's predecessor, the 4811. Definitely a better choice for VERY low-rise garments, but not my favorite..."
3,One size does not fit all.,"Yes, these are stretchy. And yes, some women swear by them. And I used to be one of them, that is, until I got hips. And then the one size started to cut into them, making them more noticeable and unattractive when wearing form-fitting dresses. So if you tend to be on the curvier side, like me, you might want to take the ridiculous amount of money these skivies will set you back and find a pair that come in more sizes."
1,Better than the rest but still uncomfortable,Although the Hanky Panky thong is more comfortable than any other thong or g-string I've ever worn they're still not as comfortable as regular underwear. Not really sure they're worth the money. I could be uncomfortable for a lot less money.
1,Worst book for SPC users,This text is one of the worst in terms of technical merit and correctness. The author obviously does not have much of an idea about statistics and how to implement SPC....
4,Contempo soul meets slick old time r&b,"This Cd came out when I was 6. Needless to say, I still remember some cuts from it playing on the radio at the time. This disc is quite good. It doesn't sound like every other mediocre, cookiecutter R&B release of the early 90's/late 80's. There is a certain vibe flowing throughout the album that tells us that while these boys were serious music makers, they were having FUN doing it! This album's few foibles are overpowered by its strengths. ""Not Gonna cry for you"" is one of the most touching songs TTT has ever penned. This album was a solid blueprint for the other Tony Toni Tone albums to come."
1,Who? That's what i said because i thought they died,I don't understand this album! Toni Toni Toni had only ONE hit but even that was too legit to quit (hey hey). Sorry but they should've dropped out of the biz they lost their fizz.
4,Dirrs trees and shrubs for warm climates,"I don't know what the above reviewer expected...by way of clarification; bamboos are grasses, and agapanthus are herbaceous perennials NOT shrubs or trees. If you are expecting to find a comprehensive acount of all warm climate plants this is not the book for you (as the title clearly states)If you are someone who is looking for a good primary survey of trees and shrubs for this zone this is an extremely useful book. Professional and non-professional alike. It may not have every esoteric specie but it will serve as a solid foundation of what performs best."
3,Dirr&#65533;s Trees and Shrubs for Warm Climates,"Well, the name pretty much says it all for this book. There are some wonderful photographs throughout the book with small descriptions beside each photo. As a reference book, this is great but I would not recommend it if you are looking for a good book to read on those long winter evenings.Another drawback is that many trees that will thrive in warmer climates are not listed. It seems to list the more commonly known ones instead of the ones that very little information is available on.I do feel that this book will be a great help to those who either know or suspect which plant they have and want to make a positive identification. The photos are definitely the best part of this particular book."
3,Not good for Southern California,I am still waiting for a reference book like this for Southern California. This book largely ignores us. Virtually nothing on Eucalyptus. Half our palms aren't there. NO bamboo at all. No Agapanthus even. Lots of holes. Suprising that there is still only Gordon Courtwright's books.
4,Recommended!,"Colitis and Me is an excellent read. Raman Prasad's story of his struggle with, and eventual triumph over, colitis is a gripping tale. Prasad's narrative is such that I was able to identify with his experiences.After reading the book, I also accessed the web site (www.scdrecipe.com). Truly excellent - have tried a couple of recipes and they turned out very well. I urge Raman Prasad to continue his literary endeavours and publish a compilation of his recipes."
5,"A helpful, moving read--beautifully written, too","This book is not only a moving portrait of a young man's struggle with--and ultimate control over--colitis; it is also, as importantly, a helpful lens through which others can view and address this serious health problem. I would recommend this book for anyone battling this oft-misunderstood disease, especially those who think they've exhausted their treatment options. Colitis & Me may offer fresh insight and management techniques. It will most certainly offer hope."
3,comforting for those with IBD.,"This book provides a good resource for those suffering from IBD. It was a great comfort to know that someone else had gone through something so similar to my own experience. It was a little disappointing that the writer did not detail his experience with the SCD diet further (ie, problems he may have encountered etc.) However despite this I often reach for this book on bad days for some much needed motivation."
3,Theis story at times feels like its actually about me...,This story will make you feel uplifted and hopeful. It also goes to show that no doctor knows your body better than you do and that one should trust their instincts. You are not alone in your battle and I felt so relieved to learn I am not the only one with colitis who is searching everyday for answers. It is a personal adventure which highlights the shortcomings of the 'system' and empowers the individual to fight back.
4,Generally excellent sound; eclectic mix; plenty of songs,"On some songs there is a faint background hiss, but only on songs that probably weren't originally recorded as well as they could have been. Otherwise, the sound quality is excellent, and I preferred these tracks over tracks that I had on my computer from other sources. Sound volume is high relative to most of my other tracks. This enhances the impression of quality.Twenty five songs is a goodly number, but five didn't make the pop charts, and three of those (""Lullabye of the Bells"", ""Love You Baby All the Time"" and ""To Be a Part of You"") didn't make any charts according to my Whitburn books.The songs may all be by female artists in the fifties, but the nature of the songs varies significantly. There is the breathy night club sound of ""Cry Me a River"" by Julie London on the same CD with ""Alone"" by the Shepherd Sisters."
1,I hated this book!!,"I thought it was dippy and pointless. The only reason I read it was because I had to for school. I would recommend everyone to steer clear of ""Jane Eyre!!"""
1,gross,This is not even in the same categorie as Iris depeche mode etc. This is euro dance crap. I think that to much of this euro dance is being lumped into the same genre of music as the groups I mentioned and that is sad. Just because there are keyboards and its dance music does not mean its in the same genre as Iris de/vision etc.
3,lost already... :-(,"I bought the earrings for my wife for our anniversary. They came in the mail very quickly. She had them for three days. Then one of them fell out. She doesn't know exactly when and where, but one is gone. The back, she tells me, does not clip on too strongly, so they fall out quite easily. They are beautiful for sure, but to lose one only after three days was quite dissapointing."
1,Everything you already know about your Defender,"A more appropriate title would be ""A brief history of the Land Rover Defender."" Don't expect any useful information if you already own a Defender 90 or 110. This book provides nothing but fluff and a few pretty pictures. For example, the chapter on modifications will tell you a tiny bit about roll bars, snorkels, winches, lockers, and skid guards, but WON'T tell you how to install so much as a shock absorber. Written and published in Britain, so if your steering wheel is on the left hand side this book will be all but useless to you."
3,Turn it Down a Bit!,"I believe that all of the compositions on this album were written well up to Moody Blues standards. But I don't think they were executed very well.The album ended up sounding too ""loud"" with technology gone awry. The keyboards were too up-front in most of the mixes and really too noisy in spots, as if the band was stuck in a bad ""Gemini Dream"" mode. I'm sure that most Moody Blues fans will agree that after the Patrick Moraz departure, things quieted down on the subsequent releases.To summarize Sur la Mer: Well written songs recorded not so well."
3,Techno Greys,"The Moody Blues released Sur La Mer on June 6, 1988 and it includes the radio staples I Know Your Out There Somewhere, No More Lies and Vintage Wine. This is the second Moody Blues album to be produced by Tony Visconti as well as the second to not feature any Ray Thomas songs and no Ray backing vocals. With all the drum machines and synth sounds being handled by Justin, John and Tony there are some who wonder about how much involvement Graeme and Patrick had with the album. After the album's release, Patrick Moraz was quite critical of how the band's songs were becoming more ""simplistic"". The album bounces back and forth between pop friendly ballads and over-synthesized rockers. As a result, most of the album comes off as filler with very little soul. That's not to say that the album doesn't have it's highlights but even then it comes off as good filler. At the time of it's release, this was my least favorite Moodies album and I think it still is."
3,DON'T BELIEVE THESE HORRIBLE REVIEWS!!!!,"while this certainly isn't their best album,it's really pretty good for the late 80's.granted,it's not a full group effort,but most of the songs are good(exept perhaps ""love is on the run""). ""river of endless love"" is one of my favorite MB songs.give it a chance..."
1,Phew! A moody blew.,"I'm glad I Know You're Out There Somewhere is on a collection. Even i threw this one away, but for you who liked it, power to you."
2,Yuck,"The Moody Blues hit rock bottom with some of the tracks on this album. Songs like ""Breaking Point"" and ""The River of Endless Love"" make me cringe. There are a few decent songs on here, including the hit ""I Know You're Out There Somewhere"", but the rest is pretty dismal. Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge are nowhere to be seen (or heard)."
1,where's my product?,"I have been asked by Amazon to write a review of the product.Since it's been more than a month since I purchased it, and it still hasn't arrived, I am unable to provide any statement on the quality of the product.The service, though, leaves quite a bit to be desired."
2,Not great,"It's unfortunate that this album is this bad. I give it two stars for one song, and that's it, I Know You're Out There Somewhere, the only redeeming factor. Don't get me wrong; I love this band. But feel free to skip this one. I'm glad they made Keys of The Kingdom in '91: It makes up for this disaster."
4,"sur la mer, sur la systeme musique",i am updating my moody blues collection from cassettes and vinyl to cd. this was just what i wanted and expected.
1,horrible!,"I had liked the Moodies earlier 80's stuff pretty well, even the overproduced ""The Other Side of Life"" (at least they still had some pretty good songs on that one). ""I Know You're Out There Somewhere"" sounded fairly derivative on the radio, but it had a nice melody and lyric. But, I can still remember how sad I felt when I listened to this one. It really just sounds like generic 80's music, with very little of the Moodies sound. Even the melodies don't stick much. I'm pretty sure that Graeme Edge didn't play any drums on this at all (everything sounds like drum machines) and Ray Thomas isn't even credited. It's really a very disappointing album--luckily, they would get better after this."
1,Buy the 1st Track forget the rest.,Bought this second hand from a friends suggestion. The tracks are predictable with lots of random noise. The 1st track seems to be the one worth listening too more than once. Save your money and get track one off iTunes.
5,A most intriguing heroine,"Georgette Heyer is one of my favorite writers because her characters jump off the page. In this case, the best character is the daughter of a social climbing matron. The daughter dresses to match her mood for the day, being on occasion, Sporty, Modern Age, Mysterious Grieving girl, etc. Her joy in making life more interesting by openly adopting outrageous roles makes this mystery a lark to read. There are lots of other ""actors"" in this book, and the mystery revolves around uncovering who is acting and if they are acting, what is their purpose?The mystery itself was not all that hard to figure out, but the journey to the book's conclusion is fun. Plus, the book has a Russian Prince in it! Gotta love a Russian Prince!"
3,For completists,"Another cast of annoying characters and an inspector a little slow to grasp the central clue. Hemingway's first solo outing is not one of Heyer's strongest. The whole shifting of class and land is rather poignant, but with no one to carry either flag with real pride."
2,Not as remembered,"Tis is one of the earlie Heyer mysteries and not as strong as They Found Him Dead, or Duplicate Death. Just Ok"
5,Storey's Guide to Raising Sheep,"This is an excellent book for those interested in raising sheep and for those that are already doing so. Excellent addition to your library. Very good chapters on breeds and on gaurdian dogs. Really enjoyed the ""shepard's story's"" scattered throughout the book!"
5,Solid first read,"Though this is not an exhaustive reference, it is full of the necessary knowledge to get you started in raising sheep. Storey's Guide to Raising Sheep should be the first book in your library on the subject."
5,Great for 4-H and FFA students!,My fifteen year old raised her first sheep for the fair this year and I bought her this book. She did fabulously and it has a lot to do with the indepth guide this book gives...very impressive!
5,Very good book lots of information,For a none technical book this has a lot of information I am still delving into the book. I think this would be a very good book for someone thinking of getting sheep. It does point out the problems one may face with this type of livestock. I have enjoyed being educated by this book.
3,Doesn't make swirl marks disappear,"I give this product a 3 star because it's not true that would make swirl marks go away. Beware of this, swirl marks still can be seen, even if you apply it by hand or machine. The good thing, it's that it does give a brilliant shine, a wet look-like new."
4,Works as advertised,"No surprises with this product. Relatively easy to use, in combination with the Porter Cable polisher, this did a fine job removing swirl marks from my speed yellow Porsche.The polish was too fine / gentle for my wife's car that needed a bit more polishing action."
4,Swirl Marks,Users of this product...Please keep in mind that it works well on GEL (Boat) for which it is intended NOT PAINT (Cars)
3,its ok,it is very easy on my sensitive pits but it doesnt smell that great and it wears out quickly but i dont break out when i wear it so i spray some axe on my shirt all is good
5,Effective and gentle,This is the best natural deodorant I've found; I definitely prefer it to Tom's of Maine's lavender stuff (though I love their toothpaste). It's pretty effective for me and I use it and even on days I don't shower I still don't smell that much at all. The texture isn't too slimy either. I still use more hard-core antiperspirant some days but this does the trick most days.
1,Cheap Motel Soap Fragrance - What Happened?,"I've been a fan of JASON Tea Tree Deodorant for a while, but the stick I recently ordered smells terrible! It can only be compared to cheap motel bar soap or a tacky bathroom deodorizer. It is truly revolting. I have contacted JASON to see if they have changed the formula. I still have my old stick and the comparison is shocking. Normally, the stick has a very subtle, fresh, natural fragrance. This is so strong and disgusting - I had just showered and deodorized and had to shower again and throw my shirt in the wash. I really hope this is just one bad stick and that I can continue to purchase this deodorant."
2,My body shudders when I think about this scent,"Well, the product does naturally cover the embarrassing smell of unwanted body odor, but only by surpassing it with the hideousness of its own scent. I'd rather die young than deal with this horrible smell."
2,I Stink :(,"This was my time switching to an organic deodorant; I was pleasantly surprised for about the 1st week ...but now I realize that clearly had more to do w/ nice weather than the deodorant. I'm nearing the end of the stick and have been disgusted by my own B.O. for a least a month. After I shower I apply once or twice a day; if I'm understand the sun the funk kicks in/if I'm reapplying, it kinda masks odor for about 30 minutes. I'm in LA, it gets hot; sometimes I bike, sometimes I'm just walkin to the corner store, either way I come home reeking. I am woman, my body doesn't perspire a lot, most of my sweat come out from my head. My pits end up smelling better when I don't use any deodorant at all (instead of Jason's)!"
3,not strong enough for me,"just not enough deodorant power; allows ""breakthrough"" odor. Jason unscented stick works for me without the ""breakthrough"" the roll-on allows."
2,All Natural but VERY sticky,"I bought this deodorant at Kroger because I have recently tried to switch all my lotions and beauty care to all natural products with no parabens or alumanum. I was happy to find this and it smelled ok when I first got it. However, once I put it on it smelled like old lady perfume and it was so STICKY! It felt like I had put honey under my arms. I really wanted to love this but I guess I'll have to keep looking for a natural deodorant that has a powder texture to it with a better smell."
2,"Hardly ""ethereal""","Reviewers have discovered the word ""ethereal""! Heaven help us. They're going to suck all the meaning out of ""ethereal"", the way they did with ""alternative"".This is not ethereal music."
4,Good basic cooler,"Nicely made, does as expected. The 1600+ XP processor 1.4 GHz was lightly clocked up to 1700+ speeds at 1.48Ghz and it ran happily at 44c running F@H.Fan is a bit noisy but par for most budget-midrange fans sound levels."
3,To clarify the one bad review,"I saw the original research model of this monitor a few years ago, let me tell you, nothing else compares. Not even today. Hopefully the price on this technology comes down in the next few years (the original price was $22k). 200 pixels per inch is pretty amazing. If you don't need it, chances are it is too much money. :)http://www.research.ibm.com/resources/news/20010627_display.shtml"
1,Too Pricey,I highly recommend that you do not buy this monitor. First of all it is too pricey for what you are getting. It has no specs that you can look at to even give you a clue whether you are buying a good product or not. There are too many great products out there to waste so much money on this monitor. I would recommend getting a Sony 23 in LCD Flat Panel monitor for $5000 less than this one. Not worth it at all for the price you are paying.
5,WOW!,This product is well worth the money! Its filer is amazing. I noticed a big difference. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great product.
2,What a Gimmick!!,"I did not know which unit to buy for my Home Theatre, so I thought what the hell, I'll buy all of them, try them and see which ones works the best. Not being surprised with the results, I saw NO significant change in sound or picture on the 2600, 3600, or the 5100. But, I still kept the 2600 as it did look nice on my rack and it does protect from surges on your coax lines as well as your AC outlets. If you want a really good surge protector, then this is what to get, but don't expect any changes in your sound or picture."
5,good for the money,awesome handling while balling on this shoe. Great grip on the court and I especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet.
3,Flock of Seagulls fans beware!,"This CD has several great songs from the 80s, like ""Kids in America"", ""99 Luftballoons"", and ""I Wear My Sunglasses at Night"". But there are two flaws:1) ""I Ran"" by Flock of Seagulls is the 3:23 shortened version of the song, it lacks the guitar solo of the extended version. THE GAME HAS THE LONGER VERSION. If you really want to hear this song as it is in the game, search ... for Flock of Seagulls and buy their greatest hits.2) Around track 8 or 9, the DJ says ""And if you are copying this, may you burn in hell!"". This is the first music CD that's ever insulted me, that was real annoying. I bought it, I paid for it, and it's accusing me of piracy?! They could have stuck another song on there instead of that.So buy this album for the other eighties songs, you'll have to buy an actual Flock of Seagulls album to get the proper version of ""I Ran"". Very disappointing."
4,A GOOD CD.,"This is a good cd.I like almost every song.It is also at a great low price! I really like the song ""I Ran"". That is a great song & I like ""Fasination"",Also a good song. & I like more. Also If you don't have The good game Grand Theft Auto Vice City,you should get it. & get it from www.amazon.com-Andy"
3,"Wave 103, some of these songs are better forgotten.","I first heard these songs grouped together on Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Some of the songs on this album are fantastic and unforgettable. Other songs on this album are best left in the 80s vault. A good overall album, that goes well with any occasion. Just be prepared to skip a few tracks...."
5,An 80's Gem!,"I bought this on cassette when it was originally released in 1986 and I liked it. Seeing it had been remastered and available on cd I picked it up. I had forgotten what a great recording this was.Featuring the great prog-rock guitarists Steve Howe of Yes and Steve Hackett of Genesis with help with little known musicians; bassist Phil Spalding, drummer Jonathan Mover and outstanding vocals by Max Bacon this group may have released one the most underrated discs of its era.This album has great playing by all and some great songs including the hit single ""When the Heart Rules the Mind"" and the ""The Hunter"" written by Buggles and Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes.If you want some eighties music nostalgia get this disc pop it in your cd player and this will take you back to the era of the supergroups."
5,Flawless supergroup.,"This one-off from this supergroup belongs in any fan of Asia/Genesis/Yes collection. A superbly written and performed collection of great songs. Only 'Toe the line' falls short, I can live with that easily. My only complaint is the 'stadium-sized mix' which results in a big sound, sometimes too big reverb-wise. Max Bacon is a very capable front-man with soaring vocals. The band cooks relentlessly. Get this and then the King Biscuit live disc."
1,Fromage,"I figured that since both Steve Howe and Steve Hackett were on the album, there would be something good, somewhere. This is a disappointingly cheesy 80s album, with not an original song to be found. With tiresome lyrics, stale synth-heavy music, and silly 80s rock-star posing, they certainly were knee deep in the hoopla. The things that make Steve Howe and Steve Hackett such innovative players are just not highlighted here - the guitars are BURIED in the mix or else playing generic, beer-commercial lines. Listen to ""South Side Of the Sky"" or ""Dance On A Volcano"" and tell me this isn't a sellout.Updated - one reviewer commented that no one pointed out how embarrassing the lyrics were. My bad. The lyrics of this album deserve special vilification. At least Jon Anderson just had vague stream-of-consciousness new age-y stuff. This is very cheesy 80s lyrics, she said babeh babeh babeh, i said honeh honeh honeh."
1,Dreadful,"This mid 80's attempt to revival that particularly pompous brand of rock known as ""progressive"" after it had pretty much been killed off by punk and new wave in the late 70's and early 80's was even more insufferable than the stuff it tried to emulate and that's saying something. ""When the Heart Rules the Mind"" inexplicably made the top 20 on the US singles chart in the summer of 1986 and was so overwrought and over produced that it made band's like Asia sound like The Clash.Cmplt and ttl sht."
2,Not very 'Asia-like',"Since the group contains some members from the '80s band Asia along with some of the song writers, I expected an 'Asia-like' album. I am not sure what it sound like, but I didn't find it very 'Asia-like'.On top of that, the track 'When the Heart Rules the Mind' is not that good. The 'fog of youth' must have clouded my judgement, I remember that track being much better when it first came out."
4,Dr Hackett and Mr. Howe vs. Kansas?,"GTR - Ive always felt there must be a brilliant album somewhere under the over-ambitious mid 80's arena rock production. I am rating it by the vinyl because that is the only medium (besides the radio) that I have listened to GTR. Actually the more revealing your hi-fi system is the worse this record sounds, I could go on in detail about how bad that is but that's already been covered.I am not down on the writing and musicianship like some of the other reviews are because I really like the songs it's just the ""sound"" that is flawed. I think I am going to have to get the remastered CD to see if that really presents GTR as I always wished it could have been. The singer is really quite good he reminds me of those Kansas albums without Steve Walsh (Vinyl Confessions, etc.) it is not a bad vocal treatment and its a good match for the musical content of GTR."
1,Very 80's and Very Bad!,"I remember well when this record came out. It was hyped big time by MTV way back when, when they played videos. Of course I ran out an bought it because it was supposed to be the greatest guitar record ever made. Turns out it was not even close. There are a couple of decent songs on this thing but for the most part it is synth heavy with very weak, thin sounding guitar work. Nothing but bland corporate rock then and very dated sounding now. Lesson learned - just because some record company throws together some veteran rockers and records them does not mean that their product is going to be good. In the case of GTR they were pretty far from good."
4,Love it,"""THE HUNTER"" is one of the best songs to come out of the decade, it is truly amazing. Max Bacon's vocals are clear and the note he reaches at the end is unworldly. Mixed with the haunting baseline, the track is Genius. The rest of the album is also good, but nothing can compare to ""The Hunter."""
4,fantastic album but it's not Nico's best,"I love the album. O.K. maybe her voice is a little different, but what's wrong with that? To be honest, I love the way she sings. She didn't write or play an instrument on this album, but she did both on, I believe, every album thereafter. I don't think this is her best album, but it's definately better than 95% of the music being released today."
3,Pleasant,"Nico has a very interestingly different voice. In fact, I really disliked her voice for a long time, but there is something about it that makes me want to come back for more. This album is quite a pleasant listen, with both high and low points. The high points are the songs written by Jackson Browne (3 of them, 2 of which are featured in the movie The Royal Tennenbaums), the Dylan cover I'll Keep It With Mine (better than the original), and Lou Reeds song Chelsea Girls. However, soome of the songs are quite boring and give the album an uneven feel. Among these are It Was A Pleasure Then, Eulegy To Lenny Bruce, and Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams.If you like Jackson Brown and The Velvet Underground, and are not totally put off by Nico's voice, then you will probably enjoy this album. Otherwise look elsewhere."
3,Grows on you,"On my first listening, I really did not like her voice, her phrasing, or the way she interpreted the songs, which are beautiful. The more I heard it the more it grew on me. It's still not my favorite album of all time, or anything like that, but her deep, pained, melodic voice grows on you and absorbs emotion over time."
3,Into the Bleak,"Nico's contribution to modern music is undeniable. Drawing from medievil organ sounds and classical European orchestration, two of her albums (""Desertshore"" and ""The End"") were ingenious collections of songs that owed nothing to any musical trends that were happening at the time. ""Chelsea Girls"" is Nico's first album after the Velvets, and while good in its own right, the songs here are so far apart from her later work that I would be surprised if fans could stomach listening to it. Nico's voice seems to accompany the 60's folk melodies nicely; ""The Fairest of Seasons"" and ""These Days"" are a wonderful opening for the album, but everything afterwards felt a bit awkward. Her voice is sometimes overpowered by the constant violin stabs and flute playing. Bob Dylan's ""I'll Keep it With Mine"" surprisingly fits however with Nico's singing and the instrumentation isn't as overblown as some of the other tracks. The album's highlight is the title track, which is insanely beautiful and dark."
1,"Um...(don't hit me) this woman can't, like, SING. You know?","Now wait a minute: ""her deep contralto""? She attempts a deep contralto, yes, but her voice--to the extent she has one--is mezzo soprano. Her deadpan delivery might have its twisted charm if she sang in her true range and if she weren't consistently flat...but, hey, who needs it? There exist in the world real singers. Really."
1,for fetishists,"More to the point, the PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER of this record should also know by now that Nico couldn't sing (very well), especially more to the point because she does not attempt here to play an instrument, to write, to arrange, to produce, or to ride a bicycle; singing is it. ""Chanteuse"", by the way, is French for (female) singer, and thus to use the word in English is to evoke the French manner of singing: boisterous, exuberant: precisely the opposite of Nico's manner--or, I should say, MANNERISM. Merely to call that manner dry would be to suggest we might go swimming in the Sahara. If Nico were a wine, she'd be so sec she'd lower your blood sugar level--and so far from evoking the manner of a chanteuse, she sings with a heavy German accent (feigned or not I can't say, but it sounds to me like a caricature of a heavy German accent, Andy Warhol's idea of camp). Her style is the absence of style.Muss es sein? Es muss!"
1,Another Britney Spears wannabe,"Sigh. When will they Britney Spears wannabes stop? We have Patti Smith, PJ Harvey and now Nico. Dumb posers! Nico has such a generic voice and this album is completely overproduced. Her voice was completely made up from a computer! For real talent, check out her idols Katy Perry, Britney Spears or Lady GaGa."
4,A taste of Nico...,but after all these years why no remastering ? this comes from tapes made in 1990-18 years old at least-and thats assuming they didnt use the LP master-from 1967
3,Sociology for the masses,"Off The Books is a fine, readable description of one neighborhood in the south side if Chicago. The concentration is on the economic life of the adults, but of course ends up covering social, political, and legal aspects of the residents. There's enough gritty detail to keep up the reader's voyeuristic interest in ""the baddest part of town"", and enough highfalutin scholarly language to maintain academic respectability.The author has consciously used his ethnicity, neither white nor Black, to learn the deals, the arrangements, the profits and losses of participants in the underground economy of his chosen subject area. It's an interesting subject, honorably researched and respectably presented. Minus two stars for dragging things out, and sloppy English. Definitely recommended if this is your field. Might be good for a general reader."
3,"Interesting, but predictable","I admit, I have not finished the book. It gives an interesting insight into how impoverished families make ends meet, and the complex relationships that exist in these communities. However, I work in a similar community, and question some of the stories. I particularly question a lot of the dialogue that he seems to quote. It also seems that he is not an unbiased observer, and portrays some of the characters and actions as heroic, where as I have witnessed the how the behavior and actions he discusses and arguably glorifies leads to the break down of society and perpetuates poverty. A conservative might classify this as another bleeding heart liberal book, which is fine, but I think the book is sold as being a scholary/scientific observation and report of the ghetto, and that it is not."
1,Too Trendy,"This book tries a bit too hard to apply economic analysis and statistical research in a trendy way. It comes off as a ""neat study"" rather than the searing portrait of poverty that many live in."
3,Off the books,"It reads like a textbook, devoid of any of the light-hearted tones of Freakanomics, this book covers in excruciating detail every social, political, religious and econominc facet of what causes and sustains an underground economy. Unfortunately very little space is given to covering the day to day transactions of this community, of who does what, how they do it and how much they make. Overall it is an impressive, comprehensive and at times, touching study of what drives this community to live as it does, but unfortunately for me it was too dry. Infomative and interesting, but a difficult read and not entertaining."
2,A tedious 382 pages,"Mr. Venkatesh obviously immersed himself in the daily life of the urban poor, and certainly has an interesting five page journal article here, unfortunately he also has an addional382 pages of tedious, repetitive anecdotes from his time interviewing the urban poor. After reading a story about someone illegally repairing a car in an alley for the 100th time (probably not an exaggeration) you start to feel like you are not really getting the full scope of the story.The limited use of any facts or survey data make this book less useful than it could have been if it were not so focused on anecdotes with little contextual data."
2,"well written, but author DOES NOT care about working poor","In this book, Venkatesh uses his academic position to exploit the working poor's income mechanisms, supposedly to explain how these types of underground economies work and affect the urban economy. Even though it is well written, this piece just serves to help ""the system"" with finding ways to mess with people's income. He uses his position to squeeze his subjects to find out how inner city people make income (by pretending he is ""down"" with them... yeah right!) and write about those sources for his book, supposedly under the careful hand of being a sociologist. Maybe he should just work for the IRS, since he is evidently not a friend to the inner city, as well as a poser, looking for academic praise on the backs of others."
3,scratched up,the faceplate is really cool but appeared to be used because it was banged up pretty bad. I definately dont regret buying it but I wish it had been in better condition.
2,"Okay for the price, way too complicated to operate","I've had this shower radio for several months...maybe a year. My husband dropped it while changing the batteries (which seems to be required rather often) and it's broken -- we can't tune it. While the reception is pretty good and the sound quality acceptable for an inexpensive shower radio, it's way too complicated to change the volume or the tuning (as other reviewers have pointed out), and I'm not a big fan of the antenna wire dangling down. At least it stays on the same station when you turn it off, as some other cheap shower radios do not, although you do have to re-tune it and re-set the volume after changing the batteries. And the plastic hanging ring works very well for use on the shower curtain bar."
1,breaks quickly and hard to use,"I had high hopes and ended up being very disappointed. I like that the display is larger then most shower/clock/radios, because my vision is poor and I can't see it otherwise. But now I've have gone through 2 of these and they both broke within a couple of months. It is awkward to use as others have described, but that is tolerable if the freakin thing would work. Very disappointing."
2,Arrived broken,"I purchased this unit as a way to listen to music in the morning without blasting the stereo in my bedroom. However, when it arrived it only played music by pressing inward on the face of the devise. The instructions to program it were fairly complicated but fairly easy to follow. I've returned the product but have not yet received a refund."
1,Save your money,"Wish I had read the reviews here before I bought it (from another website). This is a piece of junk. Yes, the item is listed as ""splash resistant"" but it's also listed as being a SHOWER radio. One would assume that it would therefore #1) be used in the shower, and #2) GET WET. But God forbid you actually GET it wet. We've had this for ONE WEEK and it died - same as other reviews...poor volume (when it got wet) and it couldn't keep the volume at a steady level (we kept having to turn it WAY up and then all of a sudden it would be REALLY loud). And the battery compartment is now completely rusted. The buttons on this were also impossible to use and the display is hard to see (black on blue does not work). We bought digital so we could find stations easier. Spend your money on a regular ole' tuner...our previous one lasted 3 years."
2,Not Very Good,"This shower radio is rather complicated to program and went through batteries very quickly.It broke after about 6 months of my using it, before then, it worked fine but it wasn't anything special.I would recommend against buying this radio unless you find its inexpensive price very attractive."
1,Waste of Landfill Space - Do Not Buy This Product,"The radio worked for just six months before it inexplicably died. In that time, it went through a ton of batteries, which was particularly annoying, because a screwdriver is required to open the battery casing. And the memory buttons are a joke - you have to press multiple buttons to change the channel, then the on/off button twice to turn the thing off when done...after the first month, and after changing the batteries, I gave up on that feature altogether.Amazon should pull this product."
1,Would be great...if I could turn it on!,"The couple of times I actualy had this radio on, it sounded quite good and decently pulled in stations. The on/off switch was faulty from the start, however, and after a few days, I was no longer able to turn the unit on. I returned the unit several months ago for a replacement to Thomson, Inc., the new owners of Jensen. I did not hear back from them and recently tried contacting them again. I can no longer find a phone number for them. I called 411 in Socorro, TX where they are located and there is now no longer a number or listing for Thomson, Inc. I recommend that you save your money and buy a different brand!"
4,Shower Radio works well,"I am pleased with this product. The digital display is easy to read and buttons easy to push. Its a little complicated to program in your favorite radio stations in to the radio memory. The detailed instruction booklet is helpful.Overall it works great. It has many wonderful features. I only need a few of them. The radio comes with a 2 foot long anttena cable wire, which can be unfurled for better reception. I would recommend this product to a friend."
2,Not happy,Poor reception - volume control was an issue - Battery compartment rusted and the unit died within a few months....dont pay more than $10 for this.
4,Nice little number!,"This is a tough little blender, basic and dependable. We make iced fruit drinks and smoothies in it as well as use it shredding when cooking. It looks retro, which we like. No complaints. Nice little number!"
5,calendar,Fufilled my needs Want to give as a gift to my grandson who admired mine which is just like this
4,seal kit,this product was as good as any but the price was better. I had no problems no and I have complaints.
5,Simply Delightful,"This is timeless kiddie lit story: Ira is invited to his first sleep over. Ira's older sister, however, casts doubt in Ira's mind. Will Reggie laugh because Ira sleeps with a teddy bear? Should he go with or without his beloved teddy? His parents are supportive and Ira makes his decision, only to change his mind once again.Jim Trealease, of Read-Aloud fame, read this story, with appropriate voices to a group of teachers. I was so enchanted with it that later, when I taught high school, I asked permission of my seniors to tell them Ira Sleeps Over. They loved it!"
2,Ghost story climax too scary.,"Not having read the book nor able to check it out from a library, I relied totally on reviewers 5 star comments when deciding to purchase this book. Just about 1/3 the way into the book my parental radar piqued at the conversation between Reggie and Ira concerning ghost stories, ""scary, creepy, spooky ghost stories."" To my sorrow, no mention or even allusion of this was in any of the reviews.My youngest 3 children (two 5 year olds and a 7 year old) are from a culture that emphasizes ghosts, the boogie man, evil spirits, etc. in a demonic fashion. Prior to becoming part of our family, ghosts were used as a form of disciplne to terrorize them to comply and obey. Even after having them in our family for a year they still struggle with the memories of these demons. Since the ghost story is the climax in Ira Sleeps Over, I do not recommend this book."
5,My favorite childhood book,"I absolutely loved this book as a child. I am handing it off to my youngest niece this summer. She's going to kindergarten and just learned to read. Never has a slumber party been so much fun! It also has a great lesson about acceptance, overcoming fear and being yourself. I can't wait for her to read it and fall in love as I did so many years ago."
3,Compact and lightweight,"I have used this for one season on both my dirt bike and mountain bike. It works fine, but for being a double-acting pump it seems to be pretty slow. It's roughly the same size as my old single acting pump, but does not seem to fill any faster. I'm not sure it is made as well as my old pump either (wish I knew what the old pump was - it was a gift). The head works fine for presta or shraeder valves, but you do have to unscrew it and flip the fitting over. My old pump worked on both types with no modifications.I don't regret buying it, but I think when it goes out (likely after next season) I'll try a different brand. For reference, my last pump lasted about 6 seasons."
1,You can do better,"This pump doesn't fit onto a Presta valve very well, and you have to be very careful when inflating the tire or else it will become disconnected. Also pretty slow. Finally, the bracket for fastening the pump onto the bike frame is a little odd, holds the pump off to the side of the tube instead of directly in the plane of the bike frame, so that one's leg is likely to contact the pump as one pedals. I have owned two other Topeak pumps both of which work better than this model. Buy one of their larger, more expensive frame pumps, this one is a poor product."
2,Not as advertised,"Even though it looks almost identical to the one pictured, I must have received the wrong item. There is no way possible for this thing (the one I received) to be compatible with a Presta valve, as the description says it is. It works OK with Schrader valves, not great though, so even if that was the only criteria I was basing this review on it would still only get 2 stars... max.On top of everything else, the package was obviously opened and the item used before I received it.Nothing else to say about it. Just simply don't waste your money on this product, especially if you have Presta valves."
4,Bikes,Gave this to both my son-in law's they both thought it was good they have not used it yet so not sure how well it works
4,Nice pump,I have used this pump several times and it works like a little champ. I would much rather use my air compressor but in a pinch this works fine for my 29er MT Bike.
2,Not recommended for Presta valves,"It works, but I had a devil of a time getting and maintaining a seal on presta valves. It's very cumbersome to use and heats up quickly. But, it is affordable, small, lightweight and connects nicely to the frame (plastic holder bolts to the frame). So, I'm keeping mine for emergency use, but if someone swipes it I won't shed any tears, and will happily replace it with a pump that's easier to use.Note -- I haven't tried this on a schrader valve."
3,"good pump,but some parts missing","I got it several days ago and found it not fitting presta valve without a converting head,which was showed on the back of the box but not include in the package,whereI checked 3 times."
4,good pump,I purchased this pump to carry on my dirt bike for trailside flat repairs. It works as it is suppose to and is made with good quality components. I have no complaints and it does what I need it to do. It takes about 50 pumps for me to get my dirt bike tire pressure to 20lbs.
4,Awesome but no instructions!,"it says specifically only sold in bike stores, so it makes sense that there would be an associate to help with any questions. it would also make sense that someone buying this fine tool would know how to use it, considering the price. I however may be the exception. no included instructions and felt a lost trying to make this sucker work. after searching online I found what i looked for, but cmon, no instructions?"
5,Good buy!! as my first bike pump for my little folding bicycle!,"I got a small folding bicycle from my friend last week. Then, I needed to buy an affordable, trusted, doesn't take space bike pump. I checked 6 bike pumps on Amazon, reading all the review and I got this one. It was bigger than I expected and powerful enough to pump my small bicycle wheels. The size ( length ) is about 11 inch, when I pull the pump all the way, is about 13.5 inch. In the picture, it looked smaller than what it is. I am glad it is bigger than I thought. My bicycle wheels ( tires ) lose air little by little and I need to give air once a week. I use it yesterday. I just push 3-4 times on each wheels. I like this product very much already!"
1,Product did not come as stated in description.,When i received my pump it came without any adapters for a Presta valve. The packaging it came in and the description shown on amazon stated it was compatible with a Presta valve yet I'm still wondering how its supposed to when it does not fit my Presta valve.
3,Much bigger than I thought,"10+ inches long, much bigger than I thought from looking at the pictures. Next time I'll take the time to check the dimensions.Seems like a good pump, but I may as well ride around with an air compressor.Dale"
3,"Great for mountain bikes, fair for road",I ride a road bike with tires that need to be inflated to 120 psi. I have used this pump several times when I have punctured a tire and this was enough to get me home. However it is not possible to use this pump to inflate beyond 100 psi with this pump. I upgraded to the turbo morph with gauge (also by topeak) and I'm really happy with that purchase. However if you ride a mountain bike then this is sufficient.
4,Go to website for Presta Valve,"Maddening at first, but after reading the reviews I went to the website to get instructions.[...]There is a video there for the presta valve change that will make life a lot easier. Could be more transparent in the ""instructions""."
2,Several unreadable pages,"I got the Kindle addition of this book. Several of the pages had the print and illustration combined. The print was so small on these pages that I could not read them, and I couldn't enlarge the print either. Fortunately I got this book for free. I would not have paid for an unreadable Kindle book."
5,A great Christmas story,I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of my youth and my Christmas memories. It was a fast and fun read and a perfect story to read to the family or for a young reader to read to the family. I want this book to be my new Christmas tradition for this year and many more to come..
3,When Mother Was Eleven Foot Four,Many of us have been blessed with mothers who in our eyes are bigger than life; who faced tremendous obstacles in their lives and still made us feel that they can do anything. They really did do much more than we realized until we look back and see it from a more mature perspective. That is what this story did. The children came to realize what sacrifice meant and how much their mother had done. In this short story they find a way to return some of that spirit to their mother.
4,Nice Christmas Story for family,sweet Christmas story :) nice for family time Enjoyed the read.... thanks for offering it on Amazon for my Kindle
5,A Contemporary Christmas Story,"I had initially heard about this picture book via the author's interview and reading of the book on a radio show. What a treat it was indeed to read my own copy during the Christmas Season! It's a simple story of loss and heartache, and then the restoration of hope and the realization of a simple theme: being the giver of gifts.Along with the standard Christmas music and lights that I set up every year, a reading of this book will take its place as part of that tradition."
5,"Insightful, Highly Relevant, Well Written",Spurgeon's insights into the great chapters of the Bible are incredibly powerful. Tom Carter has done an outstanding job of selecting passages that are highly relevant and edifying for anyone seeking to tighten their walk with Christ. My favorites are John 15 and the Sermon on the Mount. My only regret is that there are not even more great chapters of the Bible included in this book. I was left wanting more; a sign of great writing.
4,The Original Sonny Boy,"As most harp players know this is the original Sonny Boy who recorded long before Sonny Boy Williamson II(Rice Miller). This is a good selection of songs that I've heard on other collections. Missing are the classics he wrote like Good Morning Little Schoolgirl, Hoodoo Man Blues. However in the liner notes on the collections I have he is accompanied by people like Big Maceo, Big Bill Broonzy(a close friend) and Tampa Red. Well worth a listen, try Elevator Woman. This man was a big influence on Junior Wells."
2,Waste of time,"If this is one of the best animes, the rest must really blow.I liked the animation, the colors, the mood...but, ultimitley, the lack of an ending, the stupidity of the plot, make this a failed enterprise. Few seem to realize, Lain does not occur on Earth! She seems to have the power to resurect people from the dead, and time travel ability as well! Sheesh. The best thing about the series were her creepy parents. Overall, it was interesting, but it all falls apart in the non-end. On the other hand, most amusing are the attempts by people to ""explain"" it, as though it makes the least bit of sense! Tired themes done before. Don't pay full price."
2,Dull Dull DULL,"After reading the highly praising reviews, I took the plunge and bought the entire series. Big mistake!Lain tries to be something its not, in a vain attempt it tries to be arty and intelligent. But it ends up looking like a first year film students F grade mess. It is incredibly slow to get off the ground and when it does, you really have to ask yourself was it worth wasting 5-6 hours watching it.If you are still intent on buying this DVD, then buy the last in the set, as it explains to some degree what has transcended.Dull and disappointing."
4,how much do you stay online?,"this is a weird anime, that had me off my computer for awhile. im stuck on my computer again though, but after i watched that it really tickled me bad. alotta schizophrenia and online chatting. hope you like it chatters."
1,don't waste your time,"Possibly the worst attempt at a movie I have ever seen. Must have been filmed by ten-year olds with a camcorder.Had to turn it off after 20 minutes.Unfortunately, our dog ate the rental, so now I'm forced to buy a replacement. Definite waste of money..."
5,good read,"If you are a fan of the classic fantasy/horror based upon times when science just began to mix with day to day life, then this is a good choice for you. Lovecraft does a great job making you think a little as well if that is something that you enjoy. Other writters that I would liken him to include: Howard and E. R. B."
2,Not as good as I expected. . .,"I was excited when I first saw this book at my library and immediately picked it up, expecting to read lots of great tales with Lovecraftian elements/themes. However, I felt that the majority of the first half of this book was trite pastiche of Lovecraft's earlier tales - which weren't even his best ones. In fact, in the preface to the edition I had the editor even admits this! There are a few decent stories in here (the Lumely, the Campbell, and King for example) but most of the stories either fall flat or only have a sentence or two that may mention the Necronomicon or an Elder God in passing. If you're a big fan of early weird fiction(i.e. - from Lovecraft BACKWARD) and Lovecraft you may enjoy this. In my opinion there are just too many stories in here that fall short in their plot, development, and attempt to contribute to the mythos to make it worth your time."
4,Good for a chuckle or a scare,"Lovecraft is of course the master of his own storytelling framework, but some of the other authors have an interesting take on his work. Others are a bit derivative and didn't hold my attention. I love the genre though."
5,J.K. Potter's Illustrations Are Rich (Eldritch),"Well done thou good and faithful servants. Especially you J.K. Potter! Much has been said about the stories and deservedly so, but Potter's ""photos"" of Lovecraftian creatures are also well worth mentioning."
3,del rey's best,"i was a little dissapointed because i had so many stories before. HPL great as always, 2 stories here. kuttner's story's kind of good. a well written one by Derleth, but the ending was too far stretched. Howard has a good one, though it doesn't go far enough to be really interesting. King's is great, rats in the wall-like. the most interesting new read for me was Wagner's sticks. i really enjoyed the concept."
2,Out of date and narrow in scope,"I read the Cthulhu Cult Lovecraft story by curiosity when I had the opportunity while taking a vacation at the beach; it is really short and took me less than an hour to read. The story is about extra-terrestrial creatures posing a threat to men via a voodoo type cult following. When I read the other reviews to this book, I wondered if indeed the readers are not under the influence of some voodoo Lovecraft cult. I found the style and the content somewhat outdated; these stories must have been written to captivate and frighten the young teens of the early part of last century before TV and the movies were invented. Without real violence or foul language it can be enjoyed by the older pre-teens or very young teens who still believe in fairy tales. Not a must read and there are a lot of much better and more current books for this age group."
5,Perfect! Couldn't be better!,Read this book and thought that it was perfect. The car was kewl and everything was written in a great way! Keep up the good work!
5,one of the best horror boks!,this is one of my favorite books in any categorie.its well written and the characters are really great.you have to read this book if youre a horror fan.
4,made me think twice about the old chevy!,"I read this book years ago and loved it. Only stephen king could think up a haunted car story and make it so believable! I consider ""CHRISTINE"" early king but ........ early king is great too. thanks mr. king!"
4,"Typical of good King, creative , nice tight writing","As a huge Steven King fan, I'd have to rate Christine as one of his better, definately not the best but good enough.The diference between really create Steven King such as Misery and Delores Claiborne and Christine is realism. Christine is creative but wholy impobably and, therefore,less wonderfully creepy(it is after all horror we're reading)while the events in Misery are frightingly possible. Still, Christine, as a well written thriller, is defiantely entertaining and worth reading."
4,I Finally Get It.,"I stumbled onto this book when it was left in a classroom at my high school.My mother has always been a Stephen King fan. She had yelled at me for a good ten minutes once when I had accidently spilled water on a copy of Dark Tower 5.I never understood why she liked his work so much(because the bottom of her closet was once full of his work) but I do now.Christine is admittedly not the best he's ever written. I've been told by a lot of my friends(who love this brilliant but insane author) to read The Stand because it's supposed to be one of his very,very best.But it was very,very good,especially since the premise( a crazy old car comes out of nowhere and starts eating peeople) sounds lame at first.I like a book that keeps me riveted and Christine did.Besides, it made my school day go a lot quicker.Four stars."
2,"The Car, part 1,098,456,376",Guy is geek. Geeky guy buys used car from dirty old man. Car is posessed. Car makes geeky guy cool. Bad things happen when bad car is around. Very creepy. Boo!
4,Oober Creepy,"This book makes me flip out when I see an old car. I think King dragged on and on about unnessesary items, like the history of Christine's killing ability. But other than that, it shakes the foundation of the word TERROR. Mr. King, bravo!"
2,It wasn't very good.,You can't SEE what the car is doing! You can't picture the darn car! Read The Dark Half. It's much better. Way.
5,Arnie loves his car - and she loves him back,"This fantastic novel lost much of its humour and terror in its transfer to the screen. When Arnie Cunningham, the archetype high school loser, buys an antique '58 Plymouth Fury from her unbalanced owner, his world starts coming apart. His best friend, wry Dennis Guilder, can see what's happening to him, as Arnie begins to lose himself to his new love, Christine. Not only does he begin to act like her former owner, LeBay, but Christine seems to have her own ideas about driver and driven ...Haunting, frightening and with occasional touches of humour. An unconventional horror classic."
3,Other Books,"A fair chance that Joe Lansdale had read this before he wrote Captured By the Engines, I think.Christine is one big car that really does want to do her own thing.A possessed demonic sort of automobile, nothing gets between her and her owner, or vice versa, or bad things happen to the in-betweener."
1,1 star is being generous,"This is complete tripe, and the sad thing is Stephen King wrote it. The really sad thing is that it was such a good idea; the thought of a demonically possessed car in Stephen King's hands should be enough to make anybody read it, right? Well, don't. You're wasting your time. The characters are an irritating bunch, none of them even remotely likable, and the best of the cast--Christine herself--is inexplicably kept out of the 'action' (we're supposed to be scared of her occasionally gunning her engine without a driver--ooh, save me!). Like this review, the book is much too long for its own good. Avoid it."
1,Item never delivered,"I would love to review the item, but the seller opted to take the $$ and never send the product. Just another reason not to purchase used items because of people like this seller."
3,Very boring at first gets better at the end.,I read much more intesting novels by King. This was the worst novel I have ever read by him. It is very boring at the beginning but it gets better as you read it.
4,Realizing what you loose ...,"I admit that the idea of a haunted car didn't really lift my skirt and, if that was what Cristine was about the book wouldn't have either. But it wasn't.Christine is about anger, and longing, and loss. The anger of two ridiculed boys, Arnie and Le Bay. Arnie's longing for acceptance by something, someone. And Dennis' loss of the best friend he ever had. And Christine who answered the anger with inhuman devotion, filled the longing with her desire for a mate, and caused the loss by way of the rest. Christine is about things that will eat people alive and are never satisfied.You may never look at cars the same way again, or the way you treat them ..."
5,A true page-turner!,"Christine is the story about a boy who becomes obssessed with his car. But we learn it is so much more than that. I won't give too much away, but what follows is a nightmare ride into darkness. I read the whole book in two days that's how great it is. Read it!"
4,Christine By a Mile,"The better by far of the two Stephen King ""auto"" books set in Pennsylvania (the other being FROM A BUICK 8) this is far from perfect. The odd shift to third person point of view in the middle section of the book is crudely handled. And while the characters are far better developed and more interesting than those in BUICK 8, there is nothing really very compelling about the narrative until near the end, when the novel gains speed and takes off."
2,Definitely NOT one of his best,"Maybe my problem was the fact that I saw the movie before I read the book. After I saw the movie I bought the book, but I was not impressed. Usually the book is so much better, but I found myself getting bored and skimming a lot of the time. There was so much mundane crap that had absolutley nothing to do with the storyline!! It was like good old Steve was just trying to fill up space."
3,freakie car,it's a good book. it keeps you on your toes. i like it. the charicters rock and i love it. you never juess the ending
2,"Nausiatingly painful to read, but slightly scary.","Reading through this book makes you want to get your teeth scraped.The premise is unimaginative, although somewhat origional. The thrillsont the other hand are not up to King's standards. The scares only comeabout when you realize that this is a Stephen King novel and it really sucks!!!"
4,Brandon Lace,"This book is very exiting. If you didn't know, this story is about a possesed car that murders people. If you want a scary book, then I reckomend Christine. I like it when Dennis has the bad dreams about the Christine. This book has a lot of amazing adventures in it. Every thing is normal until Arnie and Dennis find Christine. After they buy Christine strange murders happened. This is not a book for children because this book has a lot of profanity in it."
5,Fantastic read highly reccommended,Great book. I loved it. The story and characters and the way it's written is so believable and kind of made me feel like I was one of the characters. I wish the movie would have taken more from the book. Excellent read.
5,I hear you knockin'...,"I loved this book! Thick as it may be, I read it in two days, and it must have really interested me, because it took me five days to read The Green Mile and four days to read The Dead Zone! Hardly has anything to do with the movie, although I liked the movie, too."
5,THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL !!!!!,"'Christine' is one of my all time favorite Stephen King books. I thought this book would be really stupid because it is about a car that kills anyone who doesn't like Arnie, or anyone who gets to close to him, but I was wrong. This book is top notch story telling that only King could have done. It never really explains how Christine is Christine, but that makes it all the more scary. This is one of those novels you won't be able to put down. I have liked all of King's novels (except for 'Gerald's Game' and 'Carrie') and this one is one of the best !"
5,i loved it!!!,i read the whole thing in about 5 days.i couldnt put it down.that shows how much free time i have.that was one of the best stephen king book ive ever read
4,Good book,"Having read a few other SK books by the time I picked up this one, I was familiar with his writing style and work. I wasn't disappointed with this one, since most if not all of his older books are great reads. In highschool for my English class we had to pick a novel to read so we could do a couple of small projects based off that book, and I chose this one. Funny thing, another kid in my class chose 'Thinner' (a book I had already read at that point)The ending of this book surprised me a bit when I read it, but looking back now (after having read more of King's books) it felt more appropriate. It's really cool to read about an evil car, my only complaint was that there was no real back story for the car, where did the evilness come from, etc. Still, whether or not you have read other King books, you should read this one if you're into evil cars. :)"
4,Character driven story.,I've read a lot of Stephen King's books. In general he tends to have a lot of stories that are character driven. The major characters in this story have really great character development behind them. A reader will really get to know his major characters in this story. Stephen King really captured what and how a typical teenager thinks. It makes for a very rich love story and great supernatural thriller.
5,"Christine, The best book out","Christine I think is the best book out there, it is about a boy named Arnie and his car named Christine. Christine had a ""curse"" of who ever wasn't nice to her of Arnie she would go out every night and kill who wasn't being nice to them."
5,"""An Awesome and Scary Read""","Stephen King's novel ""Christine"" was published in 1983 and later in the year, on the heels of the success of the book, a movie version hit theatres.The novel deals with a young man who, in 1983, purchases an old run down automobile from 1958 for $250.00. Unknown to the teenager the car is possessed by evil forces and a series of wild mishaps and horrifying events eventually take place.To many ""Christine"" is the equivilent to ""Jaws on Wheels"" and the the main character is indeed the car who is one of the best villins King has ever written.The original hardcover edition is now a collector's item and is sought after by King's huge fanbase."
4,KING IS MUCH DEEPER THAN MOST PEOPLE THINK!,"This book is great because it hits 99.9% of all the readers, it touches in the matter of the passion for cars. The car wasn't born evil, the owner made it that way, and I would like to tell anyone that reads this review, the King lovers and the King haters, that King books are much deeper than they look, they're not only a scary story, or subjects for movies, but they touch our society, our manners and depths of our brain that is very unknown yet. So, people, start readink Stephen King with other eyes."
4,Bone Thugs,"I got this CD for easter when it 1st came out and to be truthfully honest i wasent real happy with it so i put it on the shelf. A while later after cleaning out my stuff i came across it and popped it in and listend to the whole thing. Right now this has been the cd in my car for the past 2 weeks. all this new rap out now is nothin, listen to the lyrics in bone thugs compared to some of these new rappers and you will know what im talking about. keep em coming BTNH.Top 51.Cleveland Is the City2.Set It Straight3.What About Us4.Bone Bone Bone5.Home"
2,Terrible Album,"I have every bone thugs album, they are my favorite group, but this album is just flat out terrible! My recommendation: Buy any bone thugs cd as long as it is not this one. Their other albums easily make the 5/5 mark."
3,TWO is alright,"they're loosing the thuggish ruggish, and getting mainstream. Even though all the mainstream is in this LP....its still alright, you just gotta deal with the conversion from thuggish ruggish style"
4,Welcome to The BONE,"I just realized something very powerful about Bone Thugs N Harmony. They rap about exactly what is going on in there life. It makes alot of sense if you actually listen to their lyrics from the beginning to the end.This is another chapter of their life. The only thing i wish was different in this album is the Background music is too loud and it is starting to overpower their voices.Bone Bone Bone gave me a head-ache everytime i listened to it. So all other tracks were off the hoOk.The Baby isn't MINE is one of the best SONGS bone ever made cause i can't stop listening or laughing when i hear it.""DADDY is an UNSOLVED MYSTERY"" Take it eZ"
4,Guess who's back?,"I went to the store early to get this cd and I must say it was worth the wait. Thug world order has a lot of nice beats and not to mention fine vocals of krayzie bone and avant. The phil collins remake of ""take me home"" is really cool. It is a little soft, but the lyrics capture you. Very well made! The rest of the cd is pretty upbeat with ""bone,bone,bone"" being the best song. They are back and you gotta love'em!"
5,another tight album from bone,"This a tight cd, BUY it now!!ALL THE SONGS ARE TIGHTNo way is this bone's weakest albumthen again they don't have one.incase ya'll didn't know bone ain't one ofthem rap groups that only rap about money and[stuff]like that, but they got a lot of meaningfullsongs on their cds as well."
4,Bone Thugs-N- Harmony Grow Up :),"Let me say this: Not what i expected but it's still bangin. No more smoking marijuana for Bone, this was strictly about everything that has been going on in the world and in their lives. No more hardcore beats, just them rapping in harmony. They keep the guest appearances to a minimum like usual.My personal favorite on the album would have to be What About Us. This song explains it all, what is going on in the world (with the war on terrorism, Iraq, etc). Other hit singles would have to be ""Get Up and Get It"", ""Money, Money"" and ""If I Fall"".Next June Bone is expected to release another album, i just hope we get another bangin album."
5,Its Awesome,you should get this cd i promise that you would love it there songs are stronger than ever.
3,a fan,what is bizzy tripping on? (...)if you ask me this actually a good cd if it was not for bizzy messing it up eveyone else sang thier parts kinda tight but when it came to bizzy's part he sang his parts with some kinda funny voice and saying stupid stuff no wonder bone booted him out!! .....i love u krayzie hee hee had to slip that in:)
2,I Don't Like Thug World Order too much,"I don't like this album that much. This album is more for r&b and slow jam lovers than real hip-hop fans. I only like 3 phat tracks. ""Bone Bone Bone"" is definitely the best song to start out the album. The first four tracks went good, till it kind of turned. ""Home"" has a good beat at the expense of the chorus. Phil Collins sings good, but I don't like slow jams or anything like that. My favorite track from the entire album is ""Pump Pump."" That song got the tightest beat I've ever heard from Bone Thugs. I would recommend this album for r&b fans only."
3,3 Stars,"Thug World Order is a good attempt to reglorify themselves, but it doesn't show any improvement or any growth. AVERAGE album."
5,My first BTNH CD (led me to get two older CDs of thiers),"What an amazing piece of art. These guys are serious. They tell it like it is, and they see more of the world than the world sees of them. Lyrically, musically, medodically A HIT. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony are the orchestra of rap, with more melody and harmony than a dozen pop stars all together in a room. These are more than clever words pumped out a million miles a minute over top of N*&%$ this and F&*% that. No, this is a MESSAGE. A message of love, a message of hope and a message of wake up and smell the black coffee in your micky ficky neighborhood. Get Up and Get Something. BUY IT, BUT IT. Make Money, Money, Make It. Everybody listen up and learn. What about us? The children? The homeless? The forgotten? The THUGS? From brutality to spirituality, listen and learn. You will respect the artistry, the talent and the message. The sound is POW, and smooth as butter at the same time. Love you love you love you BTNH. Now Take Me Home."
5,Guess Who's Back?,"alright, i'm a big bone fan and i just HAD to type up a review for my favorite rap/r&b/soul/hip-hop group of all time. and before you all say WTF is he talking about, check a back issue of XXL where bone SAYS themselves that they can never grow old because they mix all forms of music. this album right here proves it, they mix a little bit of singing, rapping, harmonizing, etc. and you all know. bizzy starts to rap on some songs and sing on some, if you a real bone fan you'll hear the difference. bone never fell off and this album is different because it's a more mature album. everyones talking about e. 1999 eternal but they forget it was when they were young. they are grown men now and this is just them giving us real bone fans a piece of their growth. i'd recommend this anyone who is looking for something new or an escape from pop-rap acts like jay-z and ja rule...no offense."
3,"not as good as Resurrection, but still alright","It seems Bone got caught up in this commercial crap we now know as hip hop when recording this record. I bought it the first day expecting some Eternal material. The Intro and Bone, Bone, Bone were great but after that it fell off and didn't pick up until All The Way which reminded me of Crossroads a bit.A Great song to get smashed and think back on. The problem is that was track eight. A lot of people like Get Up And Get It featuring 3LW I mean come on it's 3LW. Pump Pump is great but what was Bizzy on in his verse. Was it my imagination or did he mention masterbating with another guy. Don't get me wrong I love Bizzy he ripped most verses in The Art Of War but that Pump Pump verse was absurd. Most material here is too soft and I don't remember Bone ever being soft. In conclusion if you're a Bone fan then cop this record but if you're interested in a good Bone album pick up the classic East 1999 Eternal."
1,What happend to the BTNH we used to know?,"I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible. Bad beats, bad rhymes the whole nine yards. It seems like Bone went from Thug to Corny and thats coming from a true Bone fan. A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time."
5,Impressed,My favorite song is Home ft. phil collins it never gets old even after playing it hundreds of time i would buy this cd if it only had that song but it also has other tight/deep songs like not my baby
2,Thugs need to be put in order,"When I heard that Bone thugs were releasing a new album, I was on of the first people to buy it because I thought it would be like their critically acclaimed album East 99. But I was really disapointed when I jammed it in my car stereo.I've listen to bone thugs for a long time and this has to be their weakest lp they have released.There are some good songs like ""Get up & Get it"" and ""pump, Pump which is an intense song... I was orignally was going to give it a 1 out of 5, but their intro is Old School (the evil type voice that introduces them in their other lps) so I changed it to a 2-5"
2,"Better then resurrection, but still bad.","I'm a big fan of bone thugs. first rap CD i ever bought was e1999 eternal. Old-school bone thugs n harmony is still my favorite music.This CD sucks.I'm a fan.. i enjoy some of it.. but what about non-fans? I can say DON'T BOTHER with it.Pump, Pump and Bone, Bone, Bone are the only good songs.. bizzy, in both of these songs, sounds like crap. At one point in Pump, Pump he starts making farting noises? what?Home is a decent song.. i guess.. I love phil collins, but phil collins + bone thugs n harmony? sorry, no.Realized I hated this CD when I started listening to it and it made me feel like playing old bone thugs..Forget that new bouncy R&B crap, bonethugs cant do it. Stick to stuff like Bone, Bone, Bone and Pump, Pump (please, better names?). Drop bizzy bone as well, he's turned into an idiot. Let him sing in his own albums or something"
2,What The Fxck....,Aight well I'm a big BTNH fan since the begining..All I have to say is if it weren't for Bizzy on a few tracks I would have gave it 1 star. Bone fell on this album. I love all their shxt so I ran up to bestbuy the day it came out and I put this shxt in and I couldn't even bump it...I mean cmon' getting Phil Collins...Btch please. Dont buy this album they fxcked up big time. Sorry to say it but Im pist at bone for making this peice of shxt.
4,they're back,"I got this album a couple days after it was released and i heard some good things and some bad things. its definetly a great album but its not perfect. For example, bizzy was almost kicked out of the group because he was drinking a lot during a show and he wasnt going to any promotional things. thats what we were told. maybe it could be cuz he's run out of material. Two of the best songs are ""pump pump"" and ""bone bone bone"". both of the songs would have been perfect but bizzy pretty much ruined them. he ruined all songs except for like 2 of them. Besides him everyone else did a pretty good job. they cant compete with east eternal 99 or the art of war but their new style is still worth listening to. The only song i wouldnt recommend is bad weed blues but besides that, the album is great."
5,Wicked thug world order,"Fantastic new album from my favourite crew. tha original thugs, i miss flesh on this album though, but apart from his sad absence. bone thugs have proved that they can keep up with the times and continue to improve themselves. 1. unlike bonethugsressurction which was tight in its own way, this album concentrates more on tha lyrics than the beats.2. you can actually hear wot Bizzy is sayin (first 4 me) as well as other members of tha group. 3. Wish's new style is not too bad. 4. songs are not too much 5. Nice collabo/remix with Phill Collina. Songs to look out 4. r Pump Pump, Money Money, All the Way, What about us, Bone Bone, and wicked intro lyrics by Layzie Home. Pick up this CD and Enjoy!!!"
2,Worst Bone Album,"I've been a fan of BTnH since '95, and I have all of the main albums. Resurrection was okay (about a 3/5)- if they had changed the chorus in some of the songs (like Servin' tha Fiends) it would have been great. As for T.W.O., I was really anticipating this to be their true resurrection. After seeing them on BET and flowing on the show, I was pumped. Unfortunately this became their worst album. It teases you with the AWESOME INTRO and ""Bone, Bone, Bone"", after that it hits rock bottom except for the song ""Pump, Pump""- the only other good track. This is so commercialized- it has ADVERTISEMENTS at the END of MULTIPLE SONGS. They're promoting upcoming albums from their labels-and that is plain wrong. It lacks the goodness found in E.1999. It's almost like it's meant to tease their fans. Avoid this album, get Bizzy Bone's ""The Gift"" instead."
1,Thug World Disorder,"Ruthless Records ruined Bone by cutting about 9 hard tracks off this watered down album. What would have been a hit turned into a flop. We got slow, R&B; songs instead of classic Bone Thugs. The only songs were listening too are Set it Straight, Bone Bone Bone, All the Way and Pump Pump. For some reason Ruthless cut the following tracks that would have defined this album:Secret Agent Man (which would have followed Guess Who's Back)No Love For The LawI'm BoneThugging The MostRemember Yesterday (short song but great delivery by Krayzie and Bizzy)Not Dat NiggaEveryday ThugsCan't Stop usTake ChargeIf you can get a hold of these songs, they really complete the album and you will notice the difference between what we got and what could have been. I'd rather wait for Bone to straighten out their differences and wait for Flesh to come home so I can buy a complete 'true' Bone Thugs Album then get another release as weak as this."
3,Not Keats,"I'm perplexed by the choice of illustration for the cover. It's a nice painting, and well-known, but it's not John Keats. It's a minor poet named John Hamilton Reynolds, who bears no resemblance to Keats (who had a famously wide mouth).As ""deep-brow'd"" Homer might say: D'oh! Try a book instead, maybe; authors usually do their homework."
4,Liked part 3 better.,"In part 4 Erza's ordeal with her past finally comes to an end, just before the world was wrecked by the Etherion Beam. Upon their return Natsu's team is confronted by Laxus and his lackeys. Laxus is trying to overthrow his grandfather and take over the guild. He sets up a tournament to prove he's the strongest and qualified to be the leader.I actually liked the first 3 volumes better than this one, but if you like Fairy Tail then go ahead and check out volume 4. My opinion is just my opinion, and you may like volume 4 the best. Either way, I hope you enjoy it."
2,"Does not provide what it says it does, not recomended but some use",Material is an update for experienced users not for newbies. No information on how to structure the rograms to get the smooth transitions shown nor on how to get any real help. Definately needs more information on Premere. The material is well and entertaingly presented but doesn't really address enough indepth inforamation for the experienced user or enough basic information for a new user.
5,gunsmith kitties,"i like this small episodes one shot. The epsiodes aren't very long but the animations are very well drawn. I feel the animation still stands up today. The series is worth getting if you haven't seen this by some sake of bad luck. anybody into anime has this one. it's a no brainer. no too sleazy, yet not too mundane. based on the manga which was more raunchy.there's lots of action and blood in this one and even kawaii for those that like that, even a few guys for the chicks. pick up the comics and this title, now on dvd. good art from a early time in the anime eras.my favorite parts off the top of my head would be the opening animation intro and song and most of the tight car animations in this one."
2,POS died after 12 months,"I gave this HD 2 stars because I've been reading reviews of HDs lasting only days, so the 12 months of use I got out of this WD earned an extra star for its crappy review. I didn't even bother with the warranty, since it died exactly 1 week after it was up."
1,Perfect for catastrophic data loss,"This drive worked beutifully in the first 6 months in on of our school research laboratories, regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC. After they trusted it for work and research data backup, done just once every 2 weeks, it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working. After extended agony with the customer support, they simply got nothing. Surperisingly, when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University, they discovered that many of us, in defferent departments, suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives (USB/Firewire).After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk, I can say for sure, Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage. We've been there before."
5,Classic Live Albumn from Back in the Day,"This is the best live recording ever made, along with Earth Wind & Fire's ""Gratitude"" albumn. A classic for those who grew up in hte '70's."
4,the mothership has landed,"Overall, a good record of p-funk just before they ""broke through"". There was even a fine movie ""P-Funk Earth Tour"" based on these two concerts, which as far as I know, has not been released on video. Some fine musicianship on this and the extended version of Dr. Funkenstein is the best part of the album with many of the musicians contributing outstanding solos. Some of the songs don't work as well as the studio cuts -- the performers sound as if they're bored. Despite this ""negativity"", this is still the best live representation of the world's greatest funk mob and is recommended."
3,"Great Tunes, Lousy Mix","I was hoping for something that didn't sound like it was recorded in the upper bowl of an arena. Some songs are clear, others have overbearing crowd noise. ""Do That Stuff"" is stellar."
5,Greatest Of All Time !!!!!!!!!!!,"Bootsy,(bass on Night of the Thumpasaurus People} Glen Goins(vocals on Swing Down Sweet Chariot)and Mike Hampton (lead guitar solo on Dr. Funkenstein )set this live performance apart from any other ever . George Clinton is forever the master showman/producer out front , and I don't even have to mention Fred Wesley and the Horny Horns featuring Maceo Parker doing their thing . Every funked up home should have this .BELIEVE THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Live&slammin""","Ain't nothing Like Parliament Live from back in the day.Especially with the Original Crew.You Feel The Funk&Soul thru out this Record.Back In the day The Stage was where you were made or broke.the cuts Do That Stuff,Dr.Funkenstein are Bangin"".One of The Baddest Bands ever To Rock a Live Album."
4,When Live Music was Huge!,"The horn arrangements and the Bootsy truck drivin base creates a combination that tears the roof off the mother. Recording is through boom microphones so you here a lot of the audience. However, the sound of the instruments comes through. This is an incredibly exciting disc. History was made. Ellington at Newport / Revolution of the Mind Apollo III / Clinton in LA. They just don't make em like this anymore."
5,thr bomb live,"love this whole cd, glen goins singing swing down did it for me, that was a event the mothership, how come no one discussed the mothership being one of the most popular events in rock n roll, no one else ever did what parliament-funkadelic did before, and after the mothership, the mothership then parliament singing and dancing, summoning dr. funkenstein should be legendary but it was,nt hell george lucas created star wars after hearing about this concert. i love dr. funkenstein it is about 12 minutes, good solo's by maceo, fred, michael hampton, and bernie worrell does his wizardry at the end. a good place to hear p-funk live the horny horns were givenm more duties here then on the studio recordins."
3,Good History of American Indians,"Not so flattering picture of how we mistreated and cheated the native tribes.Also a good portrayal of how we idolize frontiersmen like Kit Carson and others likeWyatt Earp and many others who were either ""lawmen"" or killers depending on who paid them the most."
2,Disappointed,"I'm definitely in the minority here, but ""Blood and Thunder"" on CD did not live up to my expectations. The one saving grace would be the information on the great Kit Carson. That is the only reason why I would give this as much as 2 stars. In my opinion, this is a biased account that almost totally favors the Navajos and other Indian tribes. Yet again, the white man is the Devil even though most rational thinkers know that there were transgressions on both sides. The author always seems to have an excuse for the Indians cutting somebody's head off because they (whatever tribe he's discussing) were driven to do this.Obama and his pals would love this book, because it would be another reason to apologize for our ""behavior""."
4,Blood and Thunder - Kit Carson,"Good read in a time in US history that hasn't been covered in ""realistic depth"" as much as the events happening in that time period or immediately following.The book touches on the Civil War and the US / Native American conflicts and helps bridge the gap in timeline and especially in what was happening in the Southwest. While the Southwest was obviously a part of the Civil War, it has for the most part been treated in a secondary fashion.While many of us have read the fictionalized accounts of early pioneers such as Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett and Kit Carson, this book provided a more factual perspective, which still proves fascinating.Overall a good read."
5,An outstanding book on western history,"This book is not only about Kit Carson and his strengths and weaknesses, it is about the era and the remarkable events of the 1800's. In my opinion, this is the most well written history that I have ever read. It is hard to put down. Hampton Sides writes amazing non-fiction and tells it better than any fictional story."
4,Blood and Thunder,I like the book and it is interesting. I would like to read more Kit Carson biographical information. The book does cover a lot of the opening of the west.
4,Sprawling and Enjoyable,"This has everything you would expect from a history of the West: whites against whites, whites against Native Americans, Mexicans against Americans, Texas Confederates against New Mexico Federals and everybody against smallpox. The axis of all of this is the singularly humble, principled, enigmatic yet flawed Christopher “Kit” Carson. A man’s man in every sense of the word, expect the instance where he probably shot some guys in cold blood."
5,very best i've read,"This is one of the VERY BEST I've ever read. I like american history, especially western history and civil war history. I prefer non-fiction, but I like it to read as fiction with good prose and literary style. I want to get ""lost"" in a book and this one made me want to go to Ariz and New Mexico.The description of the land was so beautiful and awe inspiring and of the people of that era, especially the Native Americans. I wish I could find another book I like as well. I love the writing style of Hampton Sides."
5,Outstanding read,"Outstanding research! It is easy to follow the events by simply referencing the maps in the book.By enclosing pictures of the referenced individuals and sites (as they may have appeared in the 19thcentury) allows the reader to mentally visualize the life of the main characters and events.All the important conflicts between the cultures are covered. The reader is able to feel the hostilities thatpermeated the 19th century southwest and, in some cases, still exist."
5,Blood and thunder,Hampton Sides is a great author. This is the second book I read of his and you feel like you have lived during the time frame he writes about. He is very descriptive and seems to do a good amount of research of his topic. Highly recommend his books.
4,History brought to life,"I love history. I love the south west - I lived in what is sometimes loosely described as ""Indian Country"" in northwestern New Mexico for several years. If you love these two things as I do, then you likely will love this book. It weaves a number of parallel stories intricately woven together by the life Kit Carson. It also gives some frank insights into the nature and plight of people swept aside, often without any understanding or consideration in the American pursuit of Manifest Destiny."
4,Blood and Thunder:An epic of thr American West,I bought this as a gift for my husband but he is enjoying the book very much.
3,Sometimes One-Sided and Misleading,"As I read through this book, I was amazed that very detailed research had been done and that both sides of the many stories/events had been told. I was severely disappointed when I read chapter 40 - The Children of the Mist when the description and events leading to, during, and after the Mountain Meadows Massacre. The author would like the casual reader to think that the whole event was endorsed by the then President of the LDS Church, Brigham Young. In my personal research, this is far from the case - the presidency of the church at that time would have never approved an act such as that. I would like to note that Mr. Sides did not give any references for quotes by Brigham Young or notes to what happened to the actual ringleaders of the massacre. This was a horrible event and the story needs to be told in the right context. These missing references make me question the quality of the real research that went into the book on a whole."
3,Enjoyable read,"Blood and Thunder is a lively and well-written history about Kit Carson, the exploration of the Southwest, and the eventually pursuit and incarceration of the Navajo after the Civil War.Sides really knows how to make people and places some alive. The shy and loyal Carson, the preening and vain John C. Fremont, and the proud but somewhat sociopathic Navajo leader Narbona are all brought to life along with dozens of minor characters. Sides makes a point of showing the dark side of manifest destiny and how relentlessly the Indians were pressured to give up their way of life. This book really made me want to go visit New Mexico and Arizona and see the canyons, Anasazi ruins, etc.Blood and Thunder is an enjoyable read and introduction to the topic.Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel ""To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark"""
5,Gripping introduction to New Mexico History,"I bought this book on a visit to the Kit Carson Museum in Taos, NM. The docent recommended it as the best book about their hometown hero. I assumed it would be a typical biography, but it's much more. The author recounts the history of Western expansion through the eyes of this illiterate trapper, tracker, farmer, general. This makes it more of a narrative than a dry history. It gave me a much better understanding of what I saw when I visited New Mexico, including the tensions between different ethnic groups, and the story behind the small towns I passed on the highway. As the author paints him, Carson is no simple hero, but a man used by politicians and military leaders to shape history. The hardest part of the book to read was near the end, when Carson helps starve the Navajo people into a ill-conceived reservation.This book will make my next trip to New Mexico much more meaningful, I think."
5,"""Blood and Thunder""","Absolutely outstanding epic novel of the SW in the 1840's-60's. More thrilling than any fiction could be. The authors storytelling put the reading smack in the middle of the action. A balanced account of the Indian/Settler conflict. A clear and detailed coverage of the no-win situation of the American Indians in the face of ""Manifest Destiny"".Reviewed by Will Davis author of ""Bell County Bushwhackers"""
5,Blood & Thunder,Very well written. Highly interesting. Would recommend for those who like American history. Gives a good insite to the life of Kit Carson.
1,If only the writing were as good as the history,"There are many great works of non-fiction that manage to combine skills of writing with compelling, true information. This is not one of them.While the information is all here, the author lacks a fundamental sense of what it is to tell a story. Although there are staccato sections that gather momentum, the author never fails to get in his own way, bogging down in a style that sounds like a bad history textbook.The subject matter is fascinating, but it's WORK to plow through seas of tedium in order to get back to elements that flow."
1,Secondary source history,"The author's description of the California Bear revolt, especially his description of the creation of the Bear Republic flag was not the first indication that this author had let his left-wing liberal politics jade his storytelling. And, yes, this is a story book not a history book. During the first 30 pages Sides describes the Navajos as being a tribe that was not murderous but mischeiveous. Yet, by page 100 they've gone on a rampage and slaughtered every man, woman and child. Mr Sides politics seem to flog the same old tired BS: America was and is a evil country ruled by bad men."
5,American History,A great book about the life and times of our country in the SW during the late 1800s. Very informative.
5,I am rereading this wonderful book....,"I first read Blood and Thunder in 2007. Having read Hampton Sides' magnificent book, Ghost Story,I was thrilled that this superlative writer had tackled the American westward expansion in Blood and Thunder, another historical event peopled with fascinating characters. Mr. Sides captures his readers' attention from page 1 by including details that intrigue and language that is beautifully descriptive. With Hampton Sides' books, I read right through the end pages. Because Blood and Thunder's story stuck with me, leaving me yearning to revisit its beauty and majesty, I decided to repurchase the book."
5,in the place at the time,"Kit Carson was the right man in the place he was needed. Competent and resourceful, a man of his time. An interesting tale and a lot I hadn't known about his role in the Navaho story. Well done."
5,It is so different!,"Metal symphonic or progressive? It is all that but softened by ambient sounds. I think it is more in the genre of Arena (the Immortal). This album is supported by excellent lyrics.Singer (Alan Reed)has so much presence, his voice is a criss-cross between Mark Hollis (talk Talk) and Demis Roussos (oups! what a comparaison! not as harmonic as Demis).My favorite song is ""Towers of babble"" particulary when the organ solo starts and after. It is an excellent buy."
4,Flogging a dead lyrical horse with entertaining music,"Not a bad listen at all. Lotsa fanfares and all that fun stuff that prog rock folks like. At best, Pallas sound like Asia. At worst, they sound like... well, Asia! Lyrics are bad, though: utterly cliche indictments of science and religion (Rush should sue...) which may thrill libertarians and rebellious teenagers - and embarass more mature listeners."
2,Like a wet afternoon,"I am always on the look out for new prog. This looked promising. After reading a review from someone that seemed to share my tastes, I gave it a try. Pallace is.... How should I put it. Lucky to have found a label. I spent my evening going through this CD for the 7th time in hopes to find something I enjoyed. Occasionally I found a passage here and there that I liked. More often than not, I am bored listning to this. It smacks hard of a band that badly wants to be prog, and imitates those who have done it correctly. All I can say in closing, put on I.Q.'s Seventh House and listen to the title track. I'm not one for lables, but if you want excellent neo-prog, put I.Q. on. It;s imaginative and interesting. PALLAS sounds slapped together and forced. I tried, lord knows I tried to like it."
2,Sorry but I can't compare it to the best 80's/90's newprog,"Sorry but I can't compare this work to the best 80's/90's UK newprog (including the commercial success of ""The sentinel""), because this CD is without soul, even if it's well produced,by means also of many re-recorded synths and syntethic effects too.Perhaps the unique exception is the track ""Midas Touch"", this track being anyway quite far away, though, from their best stuff of ""The sentinel"".The problem is connected with the lack of fresh ideas, despite of my listening to this CD for several times I recognise a big improvement in comparison to their previous insipid and tepid works ... even if I can't remember any melody. This stuff-live on stage -works quite well,after all!!Recommended only if you like the newprog works lacking of complexity, otherwise listen to the best IQ and Pendragon's stuff or to Deyss' ""Vision in the dark"", by which you can find a major complexity"
1,This Book is a joke,"I read many similar books and this is the worst one yet. Don't buy it!I mean it's OK, but it's more of a book for a 10-year kid, with down syndrome.This book is a compilation of Self-Help basics ex. Write some goals out!, Read these super-duper Thomas Edison motivation quotes... It gets boring really fast.. Actually, about HALF of the ENTIRE BOOK are quotes from other great books and other filler. Hahahaha. I'm so stupid for buying this book.This is NOT a book for a serious individual looking to make money.Currently i'm reading Seven Years to Seven figures and it seems pretty good. Other ones i can recommend are Growing a business by Paul Hawken and The Millionaire Real Estate investor by Gary Keller.BTW: i don't know about the reviewer before me, but i have no financial interest in anybody's book sales.Also, i was laughing a lot from the completely random God references."
2,It's a matter of proportion,"Another work attacking a straw man. Yes, there are definitely extremists who say that it is impossible for us to know anything. But there's nothing wrong - indeed, everything right - with recognizing that everything we know exists in a context and the degree if certainty we can have about what we think we know will vary. Boyle's Law is not socially-constructed, for example. On the other hand, the idea that homosexuality is a great evil stands on very shaky ground. And the idea of absolute truth, the idea that truth can exist independent of *any* context whatsoever, is just plain dumb. Even Boyle's Law depends on the actual observed behavior of gases under varying conditions of temperature and pressure."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This product not only dried out my skin, it caused me to break out like crazy. PLEASE don't waste your money."
2,The worst of a very good bunch,"This album followed up the ""Strong Persuader"" LP (yes, it was that long ago) and hit the pop side of the Cray ouevre far too hard. It has several good songs (such as ""Your Secret's Safe with Me,"" and ""Across the Line,"" which are even better live) but also more stuff that sounds like a beer commercial (the title track) or ez-listening (""Night Patrol"") than any album by someone this talented should feature. You would be better served by _False Accusations_, _Strong Persuader_, or _Midnight Stroll_ for your first dose of Robert Cray. Then go see him live. While ""Young Bob"" is now ""Older Bob"", he's still well worth a night out."
3,"Bland, very average","I bought this album based on a recommendation and hearing the title track. Ultimately, this was a mistake. This album has nothing in the way of ""killer tracks"" on it and is overall a very bland offering. I personally found this collection rather monotonous. Yes, it's blues but it's neither raw nor lively. There is far too much of the worst of Eric Clapton's influence here, it's too slick, too practised and it doesn't make me want to sing along or get my air guitar out.There is no doubt that Cray and his band are talented musicians, but the material on this album is missing the vital spark that makes for a really good listen."
4,Was It A Woman Or A Bottle?,"Tough to follow up an album that catapulted you to stardom, but I still give this one 4 stars. I like to think of this as Young Bob's Guitar Slinger album. He's just squeezing sparks out of his Stratocaster all over the place. If you've ever encountered homelessness & thought ""there but for the grace of God..."", then Night Patrol is gonna speak to you. I can remember the first time I heard this song like it was yesterday. I think this song is Mr. Cray's greatest recorded guitar playing."
3,"Some good tracks, some great ones.","When Robert Cray is at the top of his game, his smooth vocals, stinging guitar work and clever songwriting put him on par with the best the modern, electricified blues has to offer. The title track, ""Your Secret's Safe With Me,"" and ""Across The Line"" fall in this category, in my opinion. Most of the other tracks are pretty good, the rest are okay, although if you appreciate a more soulful sound, you might enjoy this album more than I do. Still, I've had this CD for years, I play it often, and it has aged well."
3,Not so practical,The idea of having the directional control in the parents hand is very good. It can teach the child how to steer the tricycle.The build of the product is too conjusted. kids dosen't enjoy sitting in it.Also I lost one pedel very easily and totally lost the usability of it in the first 1 month. (so quality is not good)
2,cheap baby toy,"Little Tikes Grow With Me TrikeWhen I searched for tricycles this one came up. I was searching for a trike that could grow with my neice. Upon arrival, I noticed that it was reccommended for up to 24 months. It didn't say in the description that it was for such young children. She had outgrown this before we got the box open. It was cheaply made. I wish I could have returned it, but after putting it together, it wouldn't fit into the box, so I just threw the thing into the garbage and we went anf bought a real tricycle. I will never order toys from Amazon again. Their descri[ptions are misleading."
1,WAY too big,"i ordered the small for this shirt and it looks like an x-large. if you're considering buying this shirt pleas order a size smaller or if you wear a small, don't buy it because it will swim on you."
3,not bad!,"this was one of my text requirment book!so i have to get it!it has a lot of ideas in it, but not very interesting. good for text book!"
3,Superficial Information -- Good for beginners who are interested in Chinese History,"If you are a beginner who wants to study Chinese history (especially ancient Chinese history), this book will be a good choice. It talks about ancient Chinese rituals, Chinese myths and different dynasties. As a native Chinese, I am not really satisfied with this book since the information is too superficial for me. However, it is good for the beginners who want to know about ancient Chinese history."
2,Poorly Written,"This book isn't bad. It covers a large amount of facts. But it is so poorly written and organized that it is extremely hard to follow, and much less learn anything without just memorizing the text itself. Now I know why this textbook only cost $25."
2,A Mess of Facts,"This was the required text for a comparative studies course I took on Ancient China and if it wasn't for the help of my prof I would have been lost completely. Even he said it was difficult to understand and he has been studying China for decades. This book was simply a mess of facts. The author should have worked more on the order of the content he was stuffing into this book. I give it two stars because of the great images it provides. But, at the end of the day, images will not teach you about China. The author may have covered a variety of Chinese history and provided nice pictures, but it doesn't do any good if it is simply scattered over the pages. I am a deans list student but not after this book. A China lover would enjoy the overview but take some Tylenol with it."
4,Felt like a biography!,"I love good biography and though this apparently is fictionalized, it felt real. My family homesteaded in Oklahoma and I had a sense of knowing more about what my grandmother's life was like back then than ever before. Very readable, I went through this in one day and am ready to continue the series."
3,"Biased, but somewhat helpful","Despite a virulent anti-public school bias, Unger's guide to picking a private school has some helpful information and tips on choosing a private school. Frankly, however, anyone who needs this type of hand-holding to get through the private school application process, is probably not private school material. Unger's best tip is to buy the Peterson's guide to secondary schools."
2,Good looks but shabby quality,"I was really excited to receive this pair of gorgeous sandals, but upon a few hours of wearing them, the links broke! Needless to say, I had to return them - very reluctantly."
2,Not worth any price.,These slippers are very pretty and attention grabbing but with a few wears the links will fall apart and the rhinestones will fall off. Very disappointed I loved the design.
4,Nice little sewing machine for the price,"I bought this machine because I liked the look, and the price was right. It is a solid little sewing machine that works great and is also lightweight to carry around. I find the positions and adjustments for width and length and needle position counter-intuitive, and I have to check the manual to get them right (might just take getting used to.) Also I sometimes have to re-thread the bobbin to get it working smoothly. I love the big platform, and I am happy with all the stitches it does. A good value."
2,Looks good but...,"I used my newly purchased machine to straight stitch in the ditch of a table runner. After that, nothing I could do could get the top thread and bobbin thread to lock together. The table runner stitches were very tightly together(I couldn't take stitches out if I wanted). I checked everything again and again and the manual of course, but to no avail. Out came my 30 year old Pfaff."
5,en busca de la verdad,"Para entender mejor la gran hazana de la conquista que mejor que saberlo de un testigo ocular de los hechos, Bernal Diaz, quien acompano a Hernan Cortez y luego a Pedro de Alvarado durante la conquista de Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador y Honduras."
5,Great Pop Music!,"I was in Saint Petersburg, Russia last April 2002. I asked about some Russian Pop Music I should take back with me. My interpretor said this was the best of the best. She was not wrong and here it is 10 months later and finally America is getting a clue about this album. Sung in Russian it has a special charm but what really makes this a excellent album is the Production Values, Mixing and Musicianship. Played very loud, it has a dynamic range, power and impact beyond your wildest expectations.(And I'm a jaded, experienced musician of many years).Their first American TV appearance was on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on 2/25/03.Highly Recommended World Class Pop Music!"
5,Pure Delight,"I first heard the Russian album 8 months ago and I just can't stop listening to it. I think this is the best Dance/Pop album I've heard in the last 25 years. The music is really good, but the singing is something else. I might not understand a word of Russian but you can't help being entranced by the emotive voices of the girls. Even my wife, who hates 'dance music' loves listening to it."
5,A perfect pop album,"My Ukrainian girlfriend introduced me to the CD on the beach in Yalta last summer. Forget the English versions, even if you don't speak Russian. The remix English version is gutless, it has been ""Americanized"" with a lot of bass removed and highs cut out. There are no ""punch out"" songs on this cd. You will actually listen to the whole thing. I saw them perform last week in Saarbrucken, Germany. Excellent show. Power pop. I hope there is a follow up CD soon. If Amazon was foresighted, they would sell the Russian version of ""200KPH"" as sold in Russia, not the recut Dvesti Po Vstrechnoi version with the songs in the wrong order. Part of the cd's power is in the original ordering of the songs. There is a great flow."
4,Homesman,"If you have ever been out on the plains in the Dakotas, you can imagine why women went crazy. The men would draw straws to establish who would escort the crazies back east. Good story and slice of history."
2,THE SONG YOU'RE ALL LOOKING FOR,"While they're racing through the streets and whatnot they are playing a song called ""Trip Like I do"" by Crystal Method. Happy downloading"
2,"just asking,","does anyone know the title and artist of the song playing at the final race in detroit? it wasn't actually playing during the race instead it was playing while the drivers were getting kind of ready for the race, you know, getting into their cars and stuff. it sounded like it was from enya or something. help me out: lyts_olsen_17@yahoo.com thanks"
2,Driving in the slow lane.,"This is a movie about racecar driving. So, why does the soundtrack include LeAnn Rimes but not the movie's hard-hitting Chemical Brother's ""Out of Control""? Where's all the cool beats I heard in this... movie? Where's the Dub Pistols? Soul Hooligan? Filter? They were all in the movie. After all, the music was the only thing that kept me staring at Burt Reynold's bad face-lift, listening to Stallone's bumbling lines or even caring anything about the characters that the story never adequately developed. Sure, the driving scenes were good. But some screenwriter (Stallone) got lazy. And didn't even bother to make up for it with a great soundtrack."
3,"Missing two songs that I've driven to for many, many months.","There are two songs in the movie but not on the soundtrack that I have been driving to for many, many months. The two songs that are in the movie and that I drive to are ""Out of Control"" by The Chemical Brothers and ""Right Here, Right Now"" by Fatboy Slim. Both of these songs have been in TV commercials. The soundtrack would have been perfect if these two songs would have been included. I'd also recommend The Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. ""Out of Control"" is on the Surrender album and ""Right Here, Right Now"" is on You've Come A Long Way, Baby. Despite the less than special effects in the movie these two songs made up for quite a bit."
