2,"Better books out there for answering the ""why"" question.","This book immediately begins with, ""there are no answersto why a person commits suicide."" That is false.If the author would have educated herself on neurobiological braindisorders and their link to suicide, she would have found thatmany times, the ""whys"" can be answered.The book does give accurate information about suicide grief though, andwhat many people experience after such a tragedy.I realize this is a book recounting personal stories, but it also wouldhave been a perfect opportunity to explain why many suicides occurand this book fails to accomplish that."
3,Rahail's Secret,"not as good as I expected after reading other reviews, but still a good movie and worth seeing."
4,Nice change of pace,"Do you love hamburgers? Do you feel guilty about the fat and cholesterol of beef patties? Here's a suggestion--try bison burgers.More and more farmers are raising bison for their meat. It has less fat and cholesterol than beef, but it tastes pretty good! When making bison burgers, the key thing to remember is that they are quite a bit leaner than beef burgers, so you can't cook it as long or it really dries out.That said, the end product tastes fine and is better for you. Bison burger over a bun with some thin onion slices, tomato, mustard, and cheese, and you have a tasty treat!"
3,Float On!,"I have always liked the track ""Float On"" by the Floaters. Unfortunately, this is the only album that the extended version is on, and I bought it only for this one track! The rest of the tracks where not of interest. However, if you are a Floaters fan, you will be very happy with this album. This was cheaper on Amazon than from a downloadable music service."
3,nostalgic value,"This his CD is pretty cheesy and of marginal quality, but it has huge nostalgic value for me & I was so excited to find it on CD. (That's what happens when you hear something often enough as a child, no matter how aweful.) ""Got to Find a Way"" is a catchy dance tune. ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me,"" while overly dramatic, has a groovy falsetto. ""No Stronger Love"" is a nice mellow tune. The highlight is the title track. When they sing ""Aquarius, Libra, Leo, Cancer...Ralf, Charles, Paul, Larry..."" --it's a classic piece of 70's music and worth buying the CD just to hear it."
2,Float On!,The long version at that. Still enjoy hearing it: Partly nostalgia and also a great mellow groove.
2,it falls short.,"It's no wonder these guys didn't stay on top for too long. Most of this album is boring with the same tired vocal style on every song. However, the title track does make up for a lot of the shortcomings."
1,This parfum is NOT the Nina Ricci my wife has been using for 40+ yrs.,My wife has been using this fragrance for many years. In the past few years something has happened to this perfume. The packaging is the same in most cases but the same scent is gone. Wife wanted the Parfum because of its staying power but this was not to be plus the original fragrance is gone and not recognizable. I have purchased this product from others and have had the same results. Amazon has stood behind its sales.
5,The Best Gospel Group Ever!,I must say that it would be impossible to fit the best songs of Commissioned on one CD. I own all of the CDs that these songs were taken from and I must tell you that Commissioned has seen me through many days. One of the things that I like about Commissioned is that their message never changed with the changes in the Gospel industry. Jesus has always been the focal point of every song and praise that these brothers have made. I recommend that you hurry up and purchase this and all the rest of the CDs that Commissioned has done. Email me if you need a list of the albums!
5,Good no-none-sense product,This massage chair is every bit as expected. Very good price for an excellent performing product. The control is very intuitive and the auto programs are well thought out. You can also use the manual mode to focus the massage on specific areas. The warranty offered is relatively short however.
1,DOES NOT WORK IN ANY DVD PLAYER,"This DVD will not work in any of my DVD players, but it will work in my computer. I am, of course, asking for a refund."
1,Not all their fault,"I disagree. It isn't that obvious. First of all, it is not unheard of to have an English book with a spanish phrase as the title. Plus, there is no reason to expect Amazon to return a spanish book in a search. I didn't order it, but I clicked on it thinking ""ooh, a new book by Cussler""."
3,Stock pot,Ideal for boiling my Christmas puddings and you could make stock but don't boil too hot or too long as it's thin on the bottom and has burn stains now.
2,ss stock pot,"I ordered this product for a gift. It arrived with a large dent in the bottom, I assume from shipping as it was quite poorly packed. Thinner and less durable than I expected."
1,The lid is worth $5-the pot is junk,"I thought a $29.99 pot with glass lid should last more that just the first wash!! I didn't even use the pot for cooking - when I was drying the pot all these black spots appeared inside the pot. The pot arrived dented - but it was at the bottom, so you didn't notice it until you were going to use it. Very disappointed and feeling a big ""ripped off""."
1,Flawed Reprint,"I did not notice the problem with the images (Plates) in the back of the book at first. Here's the order of images; note many are duplicated:Plates 1-4Plate 6Plate 11-12Plate 5Plate 6 (duplicate)Plate 7Plate 9Plate 12 (duplicate)Plate 11 (duplicate)Plate 13-22Plate 8 was missingI immediately wrote my name in the book, so I was not able to return it, so I did not write a review earlier."
5,What a basic should be,"It has been a long time since a basic has been this good. First, its transformation is neither simplictic nor overly difficulty. Like the previous reviewr says, this is an Autobot ready for war, with a twin-barrel pistol, missile that have no springs BUT can shoot out by pushing them out, with an effective distance of 8 inches. Add to this twin shoulder gatlings and the cyber-key empowered missle rack, and he looks like a Transformer should look like: ready to attack. If his legs were more poseable, he'd be the perfect basic.Get him pronto."
4,Not bad,"This is a fairly decent scout class figure. Yeah, the leg articulation leaves something to desired and there is a sizable gap in the torso, but the rest of the figure is quite good. The color scheme works well, the head sculpt is show-accurate, and the vehicle mode is almost flawless(except for the visible robot hands). I definitely like this figure quite a lot. This gets a high recommendation from me."
1,My hair has fallen out because of this product....,"When questioning the company as to the allergic reaction I had to this product, the company said they would reimburse me $8! $8 for my hair falling out and me having bald spots. This product made my hair shiny, but it also made the skin on my head inflamed and even inflamed on my ears! Felt like I had a bad perm or something."
2,Not very good,"My son who is 4 yrs old loves pc games- he doesn't care for any of the 4 cd's. He didn't find them to be very much fun, he lost interest after a short time. I regret purchasing this!"
2,My girl doesn't care for these programs and neither do I,"My four-year-old daughter plays a lot of educational computer games on a regular basis and has fairly high expectations on graphics and entertainment value that a game should provide. These activities are educational but lacking high-end graphics and a competitive game-winning environment. She only plays these when I put them into the computer and tell her, ""It's time to try this one again."" I suggest you spend your software budget on other programs."
4,Preschool excelerator is a great program!!,"I bought this 4 cd programmes for my son, and I must say that he is having a great time with them. He seems to have Alphabet Express and Millie and Bailey's Preschool as his favourites. I bought this program while he was in preschool and now that he is kindergarten, he has a good grasp of many activites he is being taught now. Thanks to the preschool excelerator. The good thing is that he is still interested in these activities and I would recommend this program to anyone with young children....I haven't regretted buying it."
3,Good value if your kid loves learning games,"My 3 year old son adores computer games so I bought this thinking that four games for the price of one was worth a shot. He absolutely loves Alphabet Express as he has a passion for letters, so he has enjoyed playing with that one for many hours. He also enjoys Millie and Bailey, and Grown Up Gabby (which from the accents is obviously from England), though he found the Bugs in Boxes ""kind of scarey."" These certainly don't have the snazzy graphics and fast pace of many of the current games, but they are an interesting change of pace that my son enjoys."
3,This book was missing something ...,Beauty in Black by Nicole Byrd had a great premise but I found myself skimming. Marianne Hughes (widow) becomes a chaperone for her neice first season in London. The Marquess of Gillingham (Who is Gabriel Sinclair's Brother from the previous novels) has come to London in search of a bride. He starts to court Marianne's neice but really wants Marianne. I would pass...not her best.
4,Some Rare Singles,"Good collection of singles, some not found elsewhere on CD.Produced by Lloyd Daley, Bunny Lee, Derrick Harriott, Phil Pratt, Alvin Ranglin and by the man himselfGood sound"
4,A funny way of looking at lives in LA.,"A collection of short essays describes and shows Loh's experiences of living in LA. The essays will make you look at your everyday life differently. Loh utilizes some of her depressing moments and makes fun out of them. I found the majority of these essays very funny, delightful and also very detail in terms of context, but few of her works in this collection are nothing more than a story of an unemployed woman who is whining about life. An enjoyable book for any of us who spend most of the day stressing at work or frustrating of job hunting."
2,I was disappointed in this book.,"I have savored Tsing Loh's commentary on Morning Edition on NPR and have been impressed with her ability to dissect pop culture, so I was expecting the same from these essays. In my opinion they lacked the spirit and animation that Tsing Loh is able to convey through her voice. The pieces often seemed to ramble on and then fall flat and die. Much of it seemed like unedited journal musings. I am hoping that this is early, early work and that her later publications will be better."
3,Nothing wrong with L.A. that a tsunami wouldn't fix...,"This mid-90s collection of humorous essays concerning the Los Angeles 'burbs is holding up well a half-decade on. Our narrator is outwardly an exotic: a biracial performance artist, but underneath the multiculti veneer the material is familiar stuff. For non-Angelenos it helps to have a map handy, as southern California regional humor involves quite a lot of dropping of place names. And you still won't quite get it when some township or other is used as a punchline.The book gets off to a wobbly start, with some generational generalizing that was out of date before the original newspaper column got to the recycling center. But soon Ms. Loh turns to her career and personal life, and we are in familiar Fran Leibowitz territory. She jokes about her (comparatively) slovenly home life, dates from hell, brain-gnawing jobs, and such. Plenty of sharp observational humor keeps things hopping, and the whole thing is a good two-evening read."
4,This book is so funny I fell off my chair,This book contains many short essays -- the majority of them are excruciatingly funny and also offer thoughtful commentary on Los Angeles life. Reading this book has helped me understand why I find L.A. simultaneously alluring and repulsive. Also the essay on how to analyze someone by the type of earrings they wear has helped me greatly in negotiating parties and social gatherings. You won't regret reading this book.
4,Fran Lebowitz for the 90's,"What Fran Lebowitz was to the 70's Sandra Tsing Loh is to the 90's.Short humorous essays on a variety of themes from Club Med vacations, Temporary Jobs, Computers, Disney and more. Many have an L.A. or urban theme but you don't have to live in L.A. to enjoy this author's humorous style or writing"
3,The *kayters* review,"This book is a collection of essays from Ms. Loh, a sometime NPR commentator and freelance writer. While some of them just weren't my cup of tea - for instance we don't even HAVE Ikea in Atlanta - some of them were dead funny. I thoroughly enjoyed her essay on how she accidentally had cybersex - I laughed out loud - as well as her acerbic commentary on political correctness and multiculturalism. I also enjoyed the pathetically tragic essay on the California Riviera.I've already purchased a copy of her novel If You Lived Here, You'd Be Home By Now and plan to read it soon."
1,Valley girl whines about the universe.,"Do you want to hear a valley girl whine because the universe does not revolve around her world view? If so, read this book. It's an excellent example of the ""me generation"" in action(or inaction). I traditionally give the books I finish to charity, but this one was put in the trash, as a public service."
2,"Ashamed to say ""I don't get it.""","Maybe it's because I don't live in L.A.Maybe it's because I've never been to L.A.I desperately wanted to like this collection of essays. I expected to like it. I felt obliged to like it. And yet... I didn't like it.All I saw were a lot of words which really said nothing at all. There was no emotion I could grapple with, no real social comment. Just words.Maybe you shouldn't listen to me. This book has gotten many great reviews. But as a fan of David Sedaris, David Rakoff and other serious essayists, I found Susan Loh to be just another purveyor of useless words."
4,The other side of Los Angeles,"Depth Takes a Holiday takes you to the reality of living in Los Angeles on the immigrant side. Sandra Tsing Loh's essays portrays the adventures of a girl interacting in one of the most diverse cities in the world. Using a very fresh style Sandra Tsing Loh approaches daily life problems in a very funny way. Los Angeles, California is a synonymous of rich and famous, paradise and glory, and Sandra Tsing Loh sees the city in a different manner. She explores Los Angeles with the eyes of a minority group, where a good meal is a fast meal and cheap. Depth Takes a Holiday is fun to read as if you were in a rolling coaster in which you laugh and yell for every essay you finish reading."
4,A Comical View Towards LA's Changing Culture,"Sandra Tsing Loh's collection of essays called Depth Takes a Holiday is, ironically, an in-depth journey of common, every day life with Loh as our driver. A native of Los Angeles, Loh depicts the many social changes of this vast urban wasteland known as home to millions of other Los Angelinos. The reader gets a better, if not comical, idea of what is going on and where LA and it's inhabitants are from and where they are going. LA is demonstrated as an ever-growing melting pot, both culturally and socially, with its residents who are a people of a lost identity in both aspects. One of the many things I love about this book is Loh's lighthearted approach which shows readers the serious effects of living in a multi-cultural environment where English-only rules dominate. Anyone who resides in LA and feels the need to laugh at its harsh realities will enjoy this book. I did.Melanie Ulloa Cal State LA, Liberal Studies Major July 21, 1999"
3,Not Sure,I would like to know what the heck is on this CD because we are very interested in Tian's music. I am told that he performed during a Billy Graham Cruisade if this is the right artist we are looking for. But we are not sure and we have no idea because there is no list of songs or anything. So would the seller please put a picture and a list of the songs on Amazon so we can see it. Thank you!
5,biography of Larry Claxton Flynt,This is a wonderfull biography of Mr. Larry Claxton Flynt that will show you all about his personal life and all the problem that he had to face in life defending our right to enforced our first amendment of the United States Constitution. This video should be placed in every library. Mr Flynt is the owner of the Hustler Empire.
2,Your grandma would love them.,"Basically,they are soundless.I crank my system to the max and they whisper.AT first I thought I had made the mistake,to the point where I took it to a friends shop.Where he confirmed that they just lacked in general.The matching 6.5's are amazing.These,not so much"
3,ok,"I bought several times on this website and the truth that the quality of their prices is good, the price is very good and the attention to the customer is good, for he who seeks anything Informatica, appliances, toys, video games , and even jewelry, very nice by the way, I recommend this website"
4,Fun treat - especially for Narnia fans,"Before I lived in Turkey with the military, I never knew what Turkish Delight was though I'd heard of it in the Chronicles of Narnia (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe). If you've never had Turkish Delight, I would compare it to the inside of a jelly bean. It is served in small cubes and covered in powdered sugar to keep them from sticking together. The plain flavor is similar to a white jelly bean. I rated it a four because it is slightly fresher and softer in Turkey, but I was impressed with the taste. Enjoy!"
4,PAT TRAVERS PT TRIO 2-SOLID,"I have listened to the latest in PT's release pattern this one is titled PT POWER TRIO 2 and it really rocks. pat seems inspired, nice selections from 60's and 70's. people in their mid 40's on up will appreciate this more than some of the youth of today. this release is a great beginning for kids to hear and then go back to the originals. pat has done all of the songs justice while making them his own. I have been critical of pat's releases because of his lack of original songs but in all due respect to his talent, he seems to have gone back to his youth. he plays with renewed fervor. musicianship is top notch and this makes the listener feel good inside. its seems pat is releasing lots of material and that is a good thing-lets hope his search to his roots brings more original songs for young and old alike."
4,PT does it again!,"WOW! Boy does this guy still know how to rip it up.All covers this time out. From ""Green Eyed Lady"" to ""You Are The Music"", there is nothing but a good time to be had by all.Pat once again makes these cover tunes all his own, putting a fresh spin on some well known classics. I mean my God, he covers Queen & Led Zeppelin on the same disc. How cool is that..Fans looking for original material, check out PT=MC2 from 2005. Also very good.Fans craving even more Pat Travers doing cover tunes, check out PT Power Trio, Don't Feed The Alligators, Blues Tracks, and Blues Tracks 2....Rock On!!!!ps -catch this guy live if you can as PT live is even better than PT on CD. :)"
3,"It will grow on you, but only so far","A few good tunes:Track 1, You are the Music (yeah! who wrote this smokin thang?)Track 5, Green Eyed Lady (good except for a few mindless atonal licks)Track 7, GFR's Aimless Lady (really good)Track 10, Bad Co's Ready For Love (OK...just OK)Track 13, Queen's Keep Yourself Alive (good guitar & trading vocals)But the other tracks are just old-school rough'n'raspy standards, un-creative and featureless. The drummer has quite an unusual high-range voice; he could grab some attention in future efforts, with or without PT. One tune I just cannot stand, ""Swlabr"". The title clues you that this one is incomprehensible. And it surely is. Overall, I liked the first PT Power Trio better. This is an average effort."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"REALLY DONT KNOW WHY I BOUGHT THIS CD. THE REVIEWS WERE TOTALLY OFF BASE. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN P.T. UNPLUGGED! NO POWER IN THESE CUTS PERIOD. BETTER TO DOWNLOAD THE ORIGINALS. EVERY CUT SOUNDS THE SAME. POOR ENGINEERING, LEAD, BASS AND DRUMS. YOU WANT POWER BLUES/ROCK GO FOR INDIGENOUS, ERIC GALES, EVEN LESLIE WEST OR RORY GALLAGER. PUT THIS LAST ON YOUR LIST."
3,Seventh Star was really a solo project,"This album was never meant to be a ""Black Sabbath"" album. It was named as such late in the recording process. Fans were expecting a typical Sabbath approach and some were dissappointed. When you look at is as the solo project it was meant to be and give the songs a chance, you will discover a really tight well recorded album. Several tracks are very catchy. If you like a bluesy feel, then ""Heart Like A Wheel"" will appeal to you. No Stranger To Love is the real star here though several others are certainly worthy of a listen as well. Don't expect classic Sabbath and you will find an enjoyable album."
2,not worth the $$$$$$$!,"I remember buying this on cassette way back when and seeing the tour when it came through Connecticut. So when I bought this, it was mainly for the live cd. The live cd is from 1986. The set list is great but the sound quality is horrible! This live cd should have been remastered and cleaned up! It would have made the double cd worth the money. In my opinion, don't waste your money!"
3,SOME GOOD SONGS....,"Seventh Star got some good songs like TURN INTO STONE, HEART LIKE A WHEEL and ANGRY HEART, but it's really not a SABBATH album...It's not an solo IOMMI album, either...Maybe a Glenn Hughes project, but it's a strange unique album with the legendary SABBATH name on it...And it's BY FAR the MOST POP moment of all IOMMI career...It's not a bad album, but SEVENTH STAR is not a SABBATH album...it sounds like a good rock pop band from the 80's..."
2,No justice for Ray.,I bought the Seventh Star cd when it first came out.When I saw it reissued with Ray Gillen on it I ran for my credit card.Tony Martin is really talented but Ray is one in a million.He had incredible talent but his life ended before he had a chance to enjoy it fully.Back to Deluxe release.Sadly the live cd with Ray singing is beyond awful sound quality.If any knows where i can get rare recordings of Ray please post them!
3,Disc 2 is basically a bootleg.,All is well with the ongoing reissue program except for the fact that the live disc included here is of HORRENDOUS sound quality and prospective buyers should've been told so in the advertising and packaging. It's no more than an audience bootleg and that's a real shame.
3,I was just reviewing Eternal Idol,And I noticed that the review said that Ray Gillen was the listed singer on Eternal Idol and this one called Seventh Star but Glenn Hughes is listed in this review on this page as the singer so who is the real singer on this release? It seems that someone has gotten themselves mixed up with the reviews? The other review says that Eternal Idol's vocals were re-recorded over by Tony Iommi after Ray Gillen left the band two weeks before the release of the album in 1987.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this software (at Best Buy) thinking it was going to have many of the features that it advertised such as ""instant"" home design. I just wanted to have fun and build my fantasy dream house. Boy, what a lemon product. My computer froze EVERYTIME I tried to embark on a project. None of the disks worked. Directions were confusing. It was such a disappointment. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. (Note: Best Buy has the WORST return policy of all. Avoid shopping there. In addition, their credit card department is a sham. Bad customer service.)"
1,Do Not Buy This Product!,"This is a piece of junk. Like previous reviewers said, the packaging look impressive and the price is low. But all you are buying are four disk that will ultimately become beverage coasters. I spent money and now I still have to go buy another program! I wish I had read reviews first!"
1,Useless...,"I thought this would have more potential based on what the back of the box said and how this program ""compared"" to the other similar programs! I was so frustrated and disgusted by the time I was done! Not everyone out there has a big, sprawling house... I have a simple cape that I want to do some remodeling on and this program basically ignores any thing of reasonable/modest size - so if you have a modest size house DON'T waste your time or money with this you're better off drawing it yourself with paper and pencil!!!!!If I could I would give it ""0"" stars."
1,horrible software,Dont know who created this product. That team should be ashamed of creating such a good-for-nothing software. the pictures are very poor quality. Even the kids games have better quality pictures. DO NOT BUY EVEN IF ITS FREE
1,Don't Be Suckered In,"This program sounds like it will do everything when in fact you can barely get started doing anything. The help ""videos"" are all glitz and no substance. Save your money for something else."
1,Awful! Not meant for modest home owners...,"I thought this might help me with plans & ideas for remodeling my cape. Well, this program doesn't acknowledge modest, middle-class homes. I read the back of the box, and this seemed to be a good program. I was so disgusted & frustrated by the time I was done trying to use it for my home. I would have been better off trying to use the good old-fashioned pencil and paper approach.What a waste of my money and time."
1,Not worth it,I thought it sounded great....but I couldn't figure out anything. I am returning it to get something better. It's almost like you just take pictures of different sizes and try to make them work. If I wanted to do that I would just use clipart. Not worth it!
1,** LEMON AUCTION **,I'm putting this piece of garbage up for auction just too see how low of a price i will get for it.1 cent bid ? it's your's LOL.
1,Faulty Product,"After two months of use the motor is now making loud ""hammer drilling"" sounds when the window switch is applied. The motor sticks and will not advance the window assembly to close. Replacing."
2,Dorman 742-150 GM Window Motor,"The GM dorman window motors are a peice of crap. Bought them from Amazon, installed them 3 weeks ago in my back doors, worked great on installation. Used about four times and one of them is already burned out. I don't blame Amazon its GM/Dorman problem."
3,IT MIGHT NOT MATCH 1992 GMC,"The price was great and i got it on time.I install it fast in my 1992 GMC safari, but when I press the up/down switch,the motor just running but the window don't go up or down.when I take it out and match it with the old one,its gear looks smaller so it don't engage the gears on the door, so i was forced to swap its gear with the old one.if you do that, it work great."
4,"Window regulators, oh yeag","These were a decent replacement. They work great. No instructions included, but not too hard to figure out. I would recommend them to anyone."
1,junk,box came with no instructions. it came with screws but none of them would fit part. i had to drill out the holes and put in new screws of my own. this item might be cheeper but do not buy this made in china junk. you will be sorry.
5,power window motor for 1991 Z28,"I think this product is a great buy for the price. I looked everywhere and this was the cheapest I could find it. It came packaged nicely and had all the nuts and bolts needed for a quick installation. It is a little louder than the original but that's not really a big deal. If you need this for a 3rd gen camaro, do a little research and you can save yourself a lot of time and frustration because there is a short cut for installing this part that takes only 30 minutes. It took me longer to take the door panel off than it did to install the motor."
5,WINDOW LIFT MOTOR,THIS PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL AND TO MY ASTONISHMENT ALL THE HARDWARE WAS INCLUDED!! YOU DON'T GET THE HARDWARE NOT EVEN FROM THE PARTS STORE. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. IT CAME AS PROMISED.
3,Does the job for cheap,"It isn't a very strong motor, but it does work. I would suggest to anyone owning a Sunfire/Cavalier that they just go to the scrap yard and find a few manually operated systems to swap into your car. They are cheap cars and are not meant to have electronics that offer longevity."
5,Great price,"I haven't installed them yet it's for a restoration of my '84 Chevy K10. The Dorman motors are priced better then any others from LMC, Classic Industries and sorts. Dorman is a well know company so I am sure they will work great. Also bought associated regulators too."
4,A wonderful guide for anyone curious as well as experienced.,"I found this book to be extremely interesting and informative. I, being somewhat young, have learned much from this book. My partner, who is older and more experienced, also found this book extremely useful. It is nice to see that we are entering into a time where men can be open about their sexuality and comfortable themselves. I would recommend this book equally to younger and older sexually active people. A great companion to my other reviewed books."
3,NASCAR Revolution SE,"The game itself may have some bugs, but the extra ""NASCAR 101"" CD that comes with it is worth the retail price alone. Its beautiful! And its packed with cool videos, animations, interviews and information. The interface is sleek and awsome. If you love NASCAR and wanna know more about Americas #1 sport NASCAR 101 is a must have!"
3,Nice all-in-one dock,"It's nice to have a ""one size fits all"" dock that will not need to be replaced along with your iPod, if you ever upgrade or add another to your collection. The S-Video output will give you better picture quality, plus you will not need to buy the special iPod AV cable (not included with your iPod). The infrared sensor is nice, but unfortunately Amazon does not sell the remote that is required to take advantage of this feature..."
1,"Right image, wrong product","This product shows as ""Discontinued by Manufacturer"". However, Amazon will still accept the order and relay it to the original seller. They, in turn, will send you the NEW docking station that does not have the S-Video output. Caveat emptor."
4,Works as expected,Nothing great about it. Does what it is suppose to do. I was aware of it's limited functionality in regards to its remote from beginning. SO not depressed by it. I like the way it hold IPOD and charges it. Not worth money but a necessary thing to have if you have a 400$ ipod. Good part is it is universal and holds any IPOD.
1,Doesn't work worth a hoot. Remote stopped working. Absolutely not worth $50,"Was working OK as a dock. Remote skipped songs, pauses/play. No menu or ipod interface control, but we knew that going in. Bought it for the looks I suppose.But... recently, the remote stopped working. Only controls volume now. Tried everything, ""pairing"", ""unpairing"" etc. Now we have a Harmony for that room and it doesn't control the dock either.SAVE YOUR MONEY! Go with something that works."
2,Not the feel good movie of the year!,"""The Living and The Dead"" is a very bizarre movie. The premise is quite simple, a husband must leave his sick wife for some time, he calls for a nurse to take of her while he's away, but his mentally challanged son insists on becoming caregiver. So it's just mom and son in this insanely large, mostly empty mansion. The son stops taking his meds and before long goes completely nutty at this expense of his poor mother. The movie is just very weird. The premise makes it sound better than it actually is. I suppose if you are fan of the ""Something Weird"" series of movies (and you know who you are) you may find something of interest here, for everyone else, you can skip this one."
2,"Dark yes, entertaining no","I think I see what The Living and the Dead is trying to be, although it's possible I'm an overly generous type and the movie isn't trying to be anything but what it is. What it is is dark and dull, much like the mind of the main character.This flick is full of awkward cuts and grating noise. The psychotic mentally incompetent son destroys his family, although the dad plays a huge role in this process by not being there for the dying mother. The movie rambles on through predictable scenes that closely match what might really happen if you put a mentally ill dullard in charge of a dying patient's care. Except for the random descents into violence, which are strange and pointless, just like most real violence.I didn't really get the point of The Living and the Dead. Might be a good flick to watch if you're really a narcissist at heart."
2,"Maybe I was just tired, but it didn't make much sense to me.","I love horror movies. I even enjoy bad horror movies. But not this one.The premise was interesting: a schizophrenic son tries to care for his bedridden mother while his father is away, and things go awry when he dismisses her nurse and stops taking his medications (and later takes way too many). I expected it to be disturbing. Thanks to the description, I even expected it to be violent. But I also expected a clearer plot. This story was way too convoluted for me to follow."
2,"Not so bad it's good, just a bit pointless","Quite simply, I feel bad for some of the otherwise good actors trapped in this film. Their presence is a clear indication of the wasted potential here. In any event, please don't be fooled into thinking we're in ""so bad that it's good (i.e. entertaining)"" territory."
2,GREAT COVER ART BETTER THAN THE MOVIE?,"I am an Amazon Vine reviewer. I requested this DVD, but never received it. I wonder if the box art is as good as the movie? maybe I'll get a copy and revise this ""review."""
1,I was living before I watched this movie but I wish I was dead afterwards...,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I truly don't even know what to say, I actually thought this was a joke. Boring is putting it mildly but given I committed to review this movie for Vine, I refused to give up on it and watched it in it's entirety. My guess would be that whomever made this movie must have been on a serious drug trip when they made this because this movie is so out there and only someone who was heavily medicated could find any redeeming qualities in this flick. Boring, ridiculous, annoying and complete torture are words I'd use to describe the Living and the Dead. Let's put it this way, I had enough time this evening to either watch this movie and review it or clean out my son's guinea pigs cage, I wish I chose the latter."
1,OMG Awful,"This was a hallucinogenic nightmare. Bizarre does not begin to describe this. There was not much thought to making sense in this movie. (Mummy is ill and the ambulances arrive. Ah, she'll be whisked off to hospital and saved. Right? Nah, the medics will cart equipment into the decayed mansion and set up a private surgery. Mum is operated on and the equipment is promptly removed.) I gave it one star but WE (hubby and I)should get five stars for sitting through the whole thing. Chewing chalk would have been more entertaining. Do not waste either time nor money on this one!!!!!"
2,Awful. Just awful,"Well this is a nice little movie about a couple of people in a big house when the father's away and the son is crazy (I thought he was retarded but according to the product description he's schizophrenic) and the mother is subjected to the son's attempt at help. For some reason the father doesn't ascertain that the nurse is going to be there at the beginning to make sure that everything is set, so the whole thing goes very bad very quickly.The son is trying to help the mother or thinks he is. The mother is pleading for a real nurse. At the half hour mark the camera gets sped up and schizophrenia is a bad music video.Somewhere along the way everyone suffers and life is pointless.This movie felt like some guy with a very big house always wanted to be in the movies. So he rented it out and let the actors do what they wanted and got his kooky friend to direct and write. The actors are good (which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one) but they are working with ghastly material."
2,Not what I expected,"Reading the synopsis of this movie, I went in expecting a physchological thriller rife with horror. But what I got instead was a bizzare and weird movie (not the good bizzare or weird).The plot is that a man must go away for a few days and needs a nurse to take care of his ill wife. However, his son (who is on meds) insists on taking care of the mother and soon after the father leaves, he stops taking his meds. Interesting premise and start filled with potentials but the movie veers into some weird paths and takes a lot of unnecessary detours. The end product basically leaves you scratching your head and saying, ""what the...?""I am hard pressed to recommend this to anyone unless you are a die-hard fan of twisted horror."
1,The Living And The Dead,"I really, really hate to give bad reviews, but this movie was awful ~~ it actually sounded like it was going to be good, but it's hard to watch, poor acting and bad writing. I LOVE scary movies, even the B listed movies ~~ this wouldn't qualify for Elivra Up All Night, it's that BAD!"
2,Okay...,"I didn't care much for this movie, however I commend fact that it is an accurate portray of mental illness. I understand the concept of wanting the audience to 'feel' the angst but I think it could have been executed a little better. It was a little to 'weird' for me to even recommend it to anyone. If you want a copy, I'll send you mine!!!"
2,Can't Recommend This Flick,"I had high hopes for this flick after reading about it in a horror magazine. The premise was interesting but I found the execution overdone. We can tell from the beginning of the film that the son is mentally disturbed but there are a lot of sound effects, music, and silly camera effects used to further punctuate that idea which I felt were way overdone and it came off more comical than disturbing. Also, there is some foreshadowing in the film that is very very poorly executing and poorly timed. Pass on this one folks!"
2,Makes You Ask the Big Questions...,"...""Why am I here, or at the very why hasn't this droll and idiotic attempt at a more 'cerebral' horror film ended as of yet?"" Imagine the bore of 'Session 9' but replace the ghost with a mentally challenged person (who just happened to tossed into the plot for what appears to be less horrifying and more, well, comic relief)."
1,Not For Me,"This movie just wasn't for me. In fact, to put it bluntly, it was hands down the worst movie ever. It went straight from the DVD player into the trash. The acting was horrible, the directing was almost non-existent, the cinematography was depressing, and the subject matter was morose."
5,I love this!!,This is the most amazing conditioner ever! I've been using it for about 5 years and it works so well.
4,I thought this product was great. My three-year-old ...,"I thought this product was great. My three-year-old daughter has very long hair and sometimes if we just use shampoo she gets tangles. This product has a pleasant scent and she loves the packaging since it looks like a toy that she can use in the tub. The only thing that I had a problem with is that it's very easy to open, and she (being 3) squeezed almost everything out."
5,My two daughters loved this product! My oldest ...,My two daughters loved this product! My oldest daughter has long thin hair that's easily tangled and this conditioner worked great. It left her hair easy to comb and very soft. My daughters think the best thing about this product is its grape smell! I would definitely purchase this product again.
4,I love the smell of this product -- ...,"I love the smell of this product -- like grape candy. It really seems to help with the flyaway hair caused by winter static. My son has very """"unstylable"""" hair because of cowlicks and I was hoping this product would help manage it a bit, but it really didn't. But it does help with the static. It also made it easier to comb through after his bath. Usually we hit a few snags, but with this product, the comb slid right through. It smells so good, I was tempted to use it on my own hair!"
3,Sometimes more is less,"Yes, Harrison at his best is a sight to see and a joy to read. These stories start off wonderfully - a body preserved in the icy cold depths of a lake has risen to the shallows and waits submerged on a ledge. A woman and daughter wait for a train in the desert. Great beginnings. But the stories go on and on and on, spiraling slowly down until you somehow stumble to the point where our hero is drinking two bottles of wine for dinner, then hitting the road for an aimless drive in his beat up pickup while drinking a case of beer, finally ending up at a bar where he knocks back shots of whiskey ""to wake him up"", and you suddenly realize you've exceeded your recommended daily allowance of testosterone-soaked macho bulls*** so you put the book down and go find something better to read."
1,Doesn't hold a charge,"This is supposed to be a six-hour battery; after emptying and recharging it numerous times, it goes out within an hour."
4,WORKS WELL,I GOT THE PRODUCT FAST. THE ITEM IS ACTUALLY .5 cm LONGER THAT THE ORIGINAL BN-VF733 BUT IT WORKS GREAT. FULL CHARGE WILL GIVE YOU 310 MINS OF OPERATION TIME. I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE SLOW CHARGER THAT I BOUGHT WITH IT CUZ IT ONLY CHARGES THE BATTERY 3/4 FULL AND I HAD TO USE THE CAMCORDER TO CHARGE IT ALL THE WAY. OVERALL IT IS WELLWORTH WITH IT'S PRICE. BESTBUY SELLS SIMILAR PRODUCT FOR AROUND [...] ! THEY SHOULD BE CALLED WORSTBUY! AND AMAZON SHOULD RENAME THEMSELVES AMAZON-BESTBUY.COM
1,Initial battery delivered did not work properly; still waiting for a replacement.,"Battery will charge, work initially but after removing the battery from the camera and then placing it back on, the camera will not power up. The Factory JVC battery does not behave in this manner so its not the camera.I received a confirmation email from the company that they received my bad battery but I have yet to receive a replacement."
5,It Worked too!,"for the price I was not expecting this battery to last past the first charge. It has been good so far, and compared to the price in the mall, well worth buying!"
2,This thing collects dust like crazy,"and it's very hard to remove the dust - frequent washing is the only way! It fits Zen Vision: M very well, but the feel in hand is terrible, especially when it collects tons of dust on it."
2,Buy an IPOD instead,"This was an expensive mistake. It's difficult to add music to this P.O.S. and when it does successfully let you ad a song to it, putting it on a playlist is a different story. You have to alphabetize it on the playlist - it doesn't alphabetize it automatically. This means, if you want to edit your playlist and remove a song you have to search for it if you didn't alphabetize the list!Buy an IPOD - I just got one this past November and wish I had it years ago."
1,Humidity reading is inaccurate! Save your money.,The humidity reading on our hygrometer varies from 28 - 30% and is completely inaccurate (it is really about 16% - we're in Denver!). The temperature gauge is closer to the actual temperature. Don't bother buying it if you plan on using the hygrometer feature. We're returning ours.
3,Good collection.,"Very suprising, amid all the cd's full of remakes that are out on Merle Haggard, this one is full of the real versions!!Great price for great music."
5,"Finally, a good Paul Simon tab book--You'll learn *so* much!","There are so many guitar books for Simon and Garfunkel, and until I saw this book, I was convinced that they were all useless.This book has really accurate transcriptions, obviously done by someone who has a personal interest in Paul Simon's guitar playing; it shows in the song selection.If you don't know how to play Kathy's Song, Overs, Peace Like a River, 59th St Bridge Song, Scarborough Fair, American Tune (and some others), this is a great, great book. You will learn so much from this book. The two part vocal harmonies are transcribed too, for the relevant songs.I just wish the book could've been longer (keep an eye out for Brad Priddy's web page), but there was enough material in this book to keep me going for at least 9 months."
4,Brown Ale,"I read this after reading pale ale, and it is interesting how most ales were likely brown (and likely smoked too!) prior to the advent of porter. Then came pale ale, then bitter, then mild, then what we think of as northern and southern brown. Very cool bit of history. I like how Ray Daniels pulls some of the Brewing Better Beers bits in (like BU:GU) to help flesh out this style a bit. Also, liked the howto on making your own amber and brown malt. The recipes were good, looking forward to making them, and perhaps even making some of the food recipes. Very good book for the most part and very instructive on the style. And, it is interesting that quite a few experienced brewers would recommend starting with brewing a brown ale (as it is a bit hard to screw up) but this is fairly advanced, and the recipes are perhaps not good for beginners. Experienced brewers will likely benefit."
3,Not a textbook for the beginner but still good to learn from,"I bought this book to learn something about the subject, and I did learn quite a bit.The potential buyer should read the subtitle closely and be aware that this is not a how to book for the first time beer brewer, you'll have to go elsewhere for detailed brewing information. This book does give a lot of history and information, good book to have if you're thinking of brewing your own Brown Ale, or just think you might want to drink the stuff."
5,Sweet!,"We got two of these, purely for the fun factor. Just a lot of cardboard, but that makes it easy to set up and take down. Recommended."
5,So Fun!,"This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again."
4,"Wish it was better, but still worth it!","Well, some of the videos on the DVD were not that great of quality and the sound has a bit muffled, but as it's Hall & Oates, we can forgive and forget heheh.Still worth the buy as it's some of the greatest hits they had in their 80s..."
2,"Sadly, I agree - Not a great release","This DVD could have been so much, but instead we got so little.No imagination what so ever has gone into this release, no extras - nothin'! Of course the songs are great and the videos have a certain place in our hearts, but after 20 years we all had those on VHS somewhere in the collection anyway - so what is the point of this DVD ? I have added an extra star because the version of Familiy Man is the longer one as apposed the the single release."
5,7 Big Ones,Seven of the best videos of Hall & Oates. Old style TV type videos. I would have really preferred a live concert DVD but the price was right.
5,Everyone should own this,"Sometimes you have to listen to an album a few times to finally get it. With this album, you won't need to do that because it is so darn perfect. If you like melody and good lyrics, you should buy this. If you don't like melody and good lyrics, but rather prefer angst and aggression, you should really buy this. It might turn you around."
4,What a bargain!,"I paid full prcie for this Pack N Play and it was definitely worth the money, so I would say it's a must purchase at this low price. If you've ever assembled a Pack N Play this one works the same way - as long as you follow the directions, it pops up in a snap, but you have to do it exactly right or you'll fight with it for hours. I had a Pack N Play 15 years ago for my oldest daughter and they were much simpler then. Now they have a bassinet, changing table and mobile. Although I've found these ""extras"" somewhat useful, I did have to take off a star because none of the ""extras"" fit in the Pack N Play carrier.If you're planning to travel with the crib it packs up nicely, but traveling with the bassinet attachment would be a no go."
5,Graco Pack N Play bassinet/playyard,"As a grandmother, i was happy to find this well designed , reasonably easy to set up , bed for my grandson when he visits. It is just what I needed!"
5,Great deal for a Grandma,I ordered this to have for my granddaughter while I babysit her. It has worked out really well. The changing table is nice to have right on top. She likes the musical mobile as well. This folds up and will travel well for vacations this year too. The price through Amazon was better than anything locally.
3,Okay purchse,"I bought this for a newborn baby boy. The pattern is pretty. I put him to sleep for the first few weeks. He hasn't been in it after we put him on a hammock.I think the quality is good and it seem sturdy. I just wish we would use it more, felt like a waste of purchase."
5,"great product, great price!",I purchased this for my new granddaughter who is do anyday now! I shopped around for the best value and this was it! Great price and free shipping sealed the deal for me. This pack & play was very easy to put together. Just follow the directions and it's a breeze. It is very sturdy and is perfect for either a girl or boy. Just be sure to either attach or dettach the changing table BEFORE picking up your baby. You need two hands to do this. This one pack & play will last through my granddaugthers first years.
5,great baby gift,The graco Pack and Play is the perfect baby gift. It arrived very quickly and in great shape. The price was very good especially compared to other sites. Thanks
3,WONDERFUL MOVIE - GREAT BLU-RAY RESTORATION - BAD DIGITAL COPY,"This is very misleading of Universal. The digital copy is neither hi definition nor restored. It is the old, muddy DVD version. When one purchases a high definition movie, the digital is supposed to be high definition as well. It's not!"
5,Excellent!,"The picture quality AND sound quality on this DVD are excellent, not to mention the fact that this is one of the best movies of all time."
2,"Written by a Tax Collector, Exciting as a Tax Collector","I picked up this book and really wanted to enjoy it. I slogged through half the book and just can't finish it. A topic matter with great promise, written by an ex-tax collector who fails to write in any compelling way. The writing, to the contrary, seems very childish; as if it would be a reading selection on an elementary school reading list - the book that every kid hated. Overall, it's saturated with a littany of unimportant details, and as a result, the book never gets going.As to the reviewer that states it reads like a daily log - I couldn't agree more. The sense of time is totally lost. It just seems like a muddle of random days all thrown together with hardly any real beginning or end. There seems to be no real purpose to the book. This is like buying employment inside the IRS. You get all the boredom without the pay.Not recommended"
5,Not Just a Tax Book....,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I began this book. Not being a business major, but a liberal arts student I didn't have an interest in the actual workings of the IRS, but I soon learned this book was much more. Yancey explained the ""technical"" part of the agency's workings in fascinating but everyday terms. I actually enjoyed the personal tale that involved Yancey's finding his way home to be the best part of the book. I think either reader, the one most interested in this agency or the one looking for a book to entertain will be pleased. I agree with reviewer Steve Weinberg, ""Confessions of a Tax Collector is not just a superb memior about working for the IRS, it's a superb memoir, period. """
4,A PLEASURABLE READING EXPERIENCE,"I make my living as a Collections Manager, so I was very intrigued by the title. What we have here is a young man looking for direction in his life. He finds it in an expected place, a job with the IRS. As a Revenue Officer (tax collector), Yancey discovers success and personal growth. The stories and his personal development is an interesting transformation. The book is very easy to read and enjoyable. The characters in the book are outstanding. Anyone who thrives in the bureaucratic world can certainly relate to all of them. Very good book, not a masterpiece but more than enough to keep you turning the pages."
1,wasteful,"Everything about this supposed expose is a waste. A waste of words, paper, ink and customers' hard-earned money. I can't believe the publishing industry is so desperate they would pay for something like this. The author is a flashy, self-absorbed, eogtistic jerk, in love with himself and his writing but with precious little else. I feel sorry not only for the people who had the misfortune to meet him in his job, but his personal contacts as well, particularly the poor woman who ends up marrying him. My heart goes out to you honey, assuming you're still married to this creep."
2,poor construction,ties on pillow came off easily when my 86 year old mother-in-law attempted to tie it to her wheelchair. They certainly wouldn't have held it in place!
3,Riddled with postscript errors,"My copy of this book is the revision by Robert Bringhurst and it is simply riddled with what I take to be postscript errors. It's so bad that I wonder how they can get away with this. I didn't pay much for my copy, else I'd have returned it for a refund. It just cannot have been proofed in the exact revision present in my copy.I award this book a (5-2) star rating. If fixed it would be a five star book. I look forward to a third edition - the authors' combined words correctly typeset."
4,Check out updated version by R. Bringhurst,"The Canadian typographer and book designer Robert Bringhurst updated Chappell's (1904-91) history. He is also the author of Element of typographic style (which is also a classic)Althought I haven't yet read this classic by Chappell. I want to read it and would like any help in finding it too!I think the new version is by Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR"
3,Not what I expected,"First of all I haven't played any MK games since MK3 for SNES, so I thought that I would give this one a try because it had all the characters. It is very cool that it has ALL the chracters from the franchise. I was disappointed that it didn't have individual fatalities for each character, because that was one of the big draws to the old games.The game seems decent, but if you are a fan of the older games like MK2 and MK3 then this is a completly different game in that respect."
3,Sorry Midway,"As much as I am excited about Mortal Kombat VS. Dc Comics, even though I don't even own a PS3 yet, I am not excited to review this game. Alot of characters, really, but couldn't you at least made new outfits, Boon!?!? I do appreciate this game, after all, it's fair, but I think they could have done MUCH better, even if we had to wait longer for the release."
3,"""Half"" decent","Well, I was honestly expecting much more from this game. My hopes were too high. The character selection is HUGE however they removed the second fighting styles from everyone I have tried. The create a character function is decent as well but it still could have been so much better. Overall I honestly wouldn't recommend getting this game, but hey if you want to go for it. I got it just because older characters like Ermac, Noob, Rain etc... were in. Unfortunately they got pretty crappy fighting styles and with no second fighting style it just gets boring fast. There isn't much variety to it at all.Played it for one day, not even a whole day, and stopped. (not including the story mode)"
5,Got to love Mortal Kombat,"I have always been a fan of the mortal kombat games, but I hadn't played any of the new ones. I was very happy with this purchase. I love my new game."
4,Ok... not the greatest,"I'm a big fan of the Mortal Kombat series. I've been playing them for a long time. This one was alright, but not the greatest. I personally preferred Deception over Armageddon. Konquest mode was tedious and not all that fun. It seemed to have a lot of mini objectives that took a while to complete, but the whole thing seemed very short. And Arcade mode, well it wasn't very challenging and it seemed as though it was very short. It only takes beating a few characters to get to Blaze, and once that's done (and you will take you 3 tries at the most to beat him) there's really nothing left to do. The Krypt is very limited, I preferred Deception's Krypt. The Motor Kombat, now that is fun. That is 3 of the 4 stars in my opinion. It's cute, and fun, and it does take a while to get tired of it. But once you get tired of it, that's pretty much the end of it. So the bottom line is, they could've done better and once the initial fun ends, it's over and done."
5,Very good book for beginners in polymer clay!,"This small book has many cute and very well-executed designs for embellishing paper greeting cards with polymer clay objects. Molded and modelled or cut with cookie cutters or templates, the designs are easy to make.Instructions are clear and well-written and there are adequate photos/diagrams to illustrate the steps and some variations. Many themes included.I would think this book well-suited for a paper-arts enthusiast who wants to add polymer elements to their pieces but doesn't know where to start, or for any crafty person who is unfamiliar with polymer clay."
5,"Amazon, Thanks! A Welcome Change!",I love this book! It is a different way to make cards that I was not aware of! I can't wait to make them!
5,Unheard music,"This is a great album. I found it and knew I had to pick it up, not even knowing the bands on it at the time. It's fun. I loved playing it in my 1990 Jetta in the summer driving around town with the windows down. It has a great early 90's feel to it. Definitely check it out, especially if you liked the early emo / dc punk thing."
3,panasonic micro-oven,"one big problem with this unit,is the turntable.anything put on the turntable must be balance.otherwise make a lots of noise. beside that, the unit works very well."
2,"Interesting, But Too Much Room for Error","I have read two of Gaunt's other books and thought I'd do a little more research. In those other ones, and this, I often find too much wiggle room in converting Hebrew to numbers. For example, which old text do you use? What figure of this or that physical constant do you use? There may be some hits in here, and the Isaiah 19 verse is enigmatic, but there is too much room for interpretation. This particular volume has some interesting history on exploring the Nile and Gaunt ties that into the gospel message. God indeed imparts design in the universe (Signature in the Cell,The Creator and the Cosmos,The Cell's Design), but these gematria, while possibly right some of the time, leave way too much room for sloppiness."
4,Good shooting fun!,"I like the way it poses. Small problems with the gun, it can't flip out the barrel when it is pointing straight forward, but I can forgive that.Hardtop is a wonderful figure, and the first US exclusive in the Cybertron line. a little advance information, they'll be releasing a recolor of him called Swindle soon, and this will be his twin brother."
1,What were they thinking?,"Okay, this is one of those toys where the designers were very, very high. What is going on with the color scheme? It's bad enough he's teal and forest green and purple, but as you transform him there's gold and yellow and some grey thrown in. He's got a lot of articulation, but with his design I guess they had to come up with a reason you'd want to buy him. His 'cyber key' function is also a joke. Not recommended for anyone other than completists and kitbashers."
5,*chemistry student review,"This book is pretty good, skim some chapters then you can know more than the drunken idiot next to you during a lecture on developing an electrode with a long life span so you can do cyclic voltammetry on some river water. That way your questions can be relevant and stimulate discussion so the drunken idiot must stay for the full q&a session to get extra credit from a silly professor that made him go there."
3,Give me Edelweiss,"""Alpine biodiversity of Europe"" isn't just about the Alps. It covers all high mountain ranges in Europe, from the Scandes to the Urals and the Caucasus. Contain extensive presentations of vegetation types and invertebrate groups from various Alpine regions. Vertebrates are covered, too. Unfortunately, the book is very technical and unsuitable for the general reader. This is a book for scientists by scientists."
3,It Comes in 2nd from the 1st!,I think the film was very entertaining. I thought it was pretty much just as good as #1.
3,"Good, but not great.","This movie was unquestionably the worst of the Psyco movies. The film was not consistant with the other Psyco films. Perkins gave a good performance, but the camera was on him for less than half of the movie. Nobody knows how Norman Bates thinks or acts better than Perkins, so since another actor has to portray Norman at a younger age, Perkins would have probably been more qualified to direct this one."
2,Matricide is the most unbearable crime of all,"I can forvive bad acting. I can even forgive a terrible script (take a line from the first film and repeat it over & over, so the audience can remember which film this is supposed to be connected with). But the one thing I hate more than anything else is when a sequel negates those that went before it. This movie puts a murder in Norman's bedroom, which has been established right from the start as the one safe haven he had, the one place where nothing bad ever happened. The only reason I'm giving this thing two stars instead of one is because I can't see Perkins or that house without going all gooey. I'm funny that way. I try to forget about this film (and the lame Van Sant remake) and simply remember Psycho III as the last in the series."
1,someone must right the wrongs that are apparent in hollywood,"someday, i will be a film-maker. and when i am, i will not let the money men (and my own desperation) push me to destroy a work of art. the first movie was great, but when i look at the new ones, i can't believe they're in any way related to hitchcock. i know he didn't have anything to do with them, but still,... why did someone have to come mess with psycho? why can't art ever be held over money (not that they could've made much off this)? i do admit, by themselves, the sequals are decent movies, but the original had sudlety, both with the violence and the sexuallity. just don't watch any of the sequals and pretend they just aren't there."
5,A terrific ending to the PSYCHO series,"I am a HUGE fan of Psycho, and I was very impressed with this final sequel. It was very entertaining and it explained alot as far as why Norman turned out like he is in my eyes. I've watched it several times, and I kept saying to my self ""I'd killed the b---h long before he did."" It was sorta sad at times, it was a perfect way to end the saga. Anthony Perkins at his best."
3,'mmkay 4,"i don't think that making a sequel is at all detrimental or desecratory to the original. I think that sequels stand on their own ground and should not be judged on the high standards usually set by their predecessors. I think that all films have the potential to be good and whether it's a fresh new story or Halloween 100. Psycho 4 is an attempt to make quality horror using human drama. It may be melodramatic but it soars high over the contrived robbed-of-a-brain mass produced slashers. This film tells with graceful nostalgia the conditioning of a broken mind and how it's caused pain to so many and left our anti-hero wanting of love but unable to obtain it.It may not have the same suspense-based set up as the original Psycho but it did appeal to my emotions. This is not a Hitchcock, this is a salute to him. And in no way does a salutor have to be as good the salutee.(if those words exist) (but you get my point, no?)[laugh, cringe, vomit]"
3,Mick Garris' Psycho IV: The Beginning,"This was an ok sequel/prequel to Psycho. It is a made for TV movie. It is about a radio talk show host(CCH Pounder) who topic for the day is ""Why do boys kill their mothers?"". So Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins) calls up and tells about his life as a boy and what made him kill his mother(Olivia Hussey) and other victums. We also find out that Norman is married and his wife(Donna Mitchell) is pegnant. After the show is over, Norman burns down the Bates Mansion to get on with his life....."
3,PSYCHO IV : THE END AT LAST,"Anthony Perkins, a very fine actor indeed was pretty much like an alcoholic when it came to Norman Bates, so in 1990 when offered the role again he accepted.Psyco IV a cable TV movie is not bad, but compared to parts 1,2 & 3, it's the worst of the four. this time around, Norman is paroled, married to his shrink no less, and living an ideal life until past memories come back and haunt him. ET's Henry Thomas plays young Norman in the flashbacks, with Olivia Hussey as Norma Bates. both are mis-cast and unconvincing in their roles.back to adult Norman, he's planning on killing again.Can he be stopped ?The original 1960's movie score is back for this one, which makes you want to see that movie again after watching this one."
2,"good for laughs,but not scary","This movie was a joke.It was also inconsistent with the other Psycho movies.First of all ,Mrs.Bates was really Norman's aunt(if you saw Psycho 2)And also Mrs.Bates and her lover were found in bed(Psycho 1) but here they were found in the basement.And Norman was supposed to have killed them when he was 12 years old (psycho 2)but in Psycho 4 he killed them when he was 15..Those are just a few examples.They took a good movie(The original Psycho) and made a joke out of it by creating this satirical film.It was not scary at all,just ridiculous."
2,"So bad,they didn't dare put it in the movies","I knew this movie was going to be bad. What a diaster!I now know that the only reason Perkins did this was because he knew he was dying from A.I.D.S and he wanted to leave his family some money.Oh well.It was so bad that the studio knew not to put this in the movies so it first premired on cable.Then they just pretend that 2,3 didn't happen.What a shame.Each one got worse including the new Psycho which was worse than 4."
5,"Excellent Final Chapter- You've met Norman, Now meet Mother","Psycho IV- The Beginning explores both the past and future of Norman Bates. It starts off when the cured Norman Bates calls into his favorite radio station to discuss the nights topic, which happens to be matricide. He starts to tell his life story and past experiences with his mother to the radio talk show host- We get to learn more about Norman's mother and the way she treated him before he killed her. We get to see what went on before he killed his mother and why he did it. Norman is no longer under the control of his mother and has now fallen in love with a woman. She is pregnant and he dosent want to have a baby for fear of passing along his blood line. Then comes the suprising ending. Excellent acting by all. Great end to the series. The young Norman ( Henry Thomas) was also perfect for the role. You should definetly get this if you are a fan of the previous chapters or are looking to complete your collection. Highly Recomended."
4,You've met Norman.Now meet mother,"This made for T.V.movie shows us just how Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins)become a killer.While listening to a talk radio show whose topic is ""Why boys kill their mothers""?After hearing some of the people,Norman deiceds to call in and talk about his experinces with his mother growing up as a teenager and what led to Norman killing his mother.We also find out that Norman as a wife and that's she pregant and Norman is so scared that the baby will grow-up to be just like him.This was the last time we would see Anthony Perkins play his most famous character of all time.Psycho 4 is alittle bit better then the 3rd one but of course not as good as the first one."
3,mrs. spool was not normans mother,a few of the reviews say that norma bates was not normans mother but just his aunt and a person named mrs. spool was actually his mother as was stated in psycho 2. this was resolved however in psycho 3 when the reporter found out that mrs spool was actually his aunt. she was crazy and started to believe that she was actually normans mother. the reporter revealed this to norman at the end. that is why in psycho 4 norman talked about norma being his biological mother because she was.
4,Thank you for the criticism,"I'm the author of the book, and appreciate the criticisms and praises. I *would* like to let folks know that I wrote this book when I was 19 years young, and had a lot to learn. I wrote it in response to a very bad, and misinformative book that was considered the 'bible' of indigenous archery books at the time. Now, there are many books available on this wonderful subject.Jim Hamm's book, video, and classes are invaluable. So is TM Hamilton's book, and DC Waldorf as well.Don't miss my ""Voices of Native America"" music book as well."
3,A bit judging and little detail on important subjects.,"This book is overall pretty good, but does not offer much for the slightly experienced bowyer. He is very narrow in his writings and do not discuss options very broadly, but makes a rapid and narrow conclusion. I also missed a little bit on the thing I bought the book for, which was how to make the weapons the old way, with primitive tools. He mentions it briefly, but is much more detailed on the use of metals instead. For beginners it is ok, but there are many similar books that provide better and more detailed information on making bows and arrows."
4,The title is correct,"This is a book written from the heart by a man who wants to share his knowledge. It is a practical help with explanations and guidance on the correct materials and their applications in the makings of various catergories of indian bows and accessories. The traditions have been handed down through the author and he has taken the courage and effort to write it down. The narrative is perhaps a little naive, but the heart is in the right place. He has gone to a lot of trouble to learn his art, which is different from the glass and wood bowyers. His designs are good and well researched and my youngest now has a passion for a snakeskin bow and natural arrows. A true native design in simplicity and understanding."
5,"There is no ""right way"" to make a bow...","I've been flint knapping now for years. I bought this book way back when I started flint knapping but never really read through it. My focus was on stone tools. Seemingly out of the blue, my interest in making primitive weapons was renewed after watching a video on youtube about making a bow with only stone tools. Now I'm shifting my focus on making bows and arrows the old way. Doug gave an objective view throughout the entirety of this book. His fine craftmanship speaks for itself. I really enjoyed the section on sinew backing and snake skin backing. This book is perfect for the beginger, novice and expert bowyer (As long as one is open-minded for new learning and others ideas). There is no ""right way"" to make a bow, just different ways and this book will give you tons of ideas as well as igniting an inspiration and enthusiasm for making bows and arrows!Doug...please make a video to go along with the book. -James"
5,Great idea for the kids to do with Grandpa,"I have not read this book, bought it for my father-in-law - he wants to help the boys, ages 10 and 11 create some of the items in this book. The book was in great condition - looked brand new."
4,NOT EURO-CHEESE! THIS IS YET ANOTHER ALBUM WORTH BUYING!!,"Some reviewer called this album ""Euro-Cheese"". That is a totally wrong statement!! This album has a few flaws like any other album, but overall it is well worth buying!! This is not what cheese sounds like!! This is great tunes mixed together!! If you want to hear cheese, get ""Trance Addiction""...that is mostly cheese, not this!! This album is great for new listeners as well as experienced listeners...I should know, I've been listening to all kinds of Electronica for over 8 years!!"
1,Worst Trance CD,"Dont waste your money on this cd as I did. Worst Armin Van Buuren Cd made. I have all his cd's and this is the worst of them. Very simple and annoying trance songs. I think at the time the cd came out the sounds were ""cutting edge"" but now 5-6 years latter its just cheesy and bad. As always he did a good job mixing but this cd is just not good. I suggest buying all the other armin cd's ( very good music selection found there) excpect for this one"
5,Awesome Trance,"I was at this CD shop and they played this CD. I listen to it and saw the CD. It was only 1 disc and the price was a bit steep. But I kept on listening and I just must buy this CD.A extremely good CD. His trance music selection and mixing are just fantastic. The music really just flow through your head. I especially like the track number 5, 6 and 7. Just great. He move from slow trance to progressively hard.Trance Forever!!"
3,Works okay but the clip could be smaller,"This jacket fit the mp3 player nicely and performed as advertised, but that big clip on the back of the jacket constantly gets caught on things when you try to put it into a briefcase or pocket. After only two weeks, I broke mine off and had to buy a new one. But, as far as I know, DLO has the market cornered on cases for the Samsung T7."
5,good product it works,"I have normal hair, but its dry. I knew buying it that I shouldn't expect it to be a salon treatment- so I think my expectations were reasonable. It was great and it works like a charm on relatively normal hair.My coworkers noticed it as well. Big difference from before, lot of shine. I wash my hair everyday out of habit and i blow dry, flat iron. My hair is straight with a bit of wave. I recommend this to just about anyone. I think it is a great product to use instead of expensive morrocan oil."
5,great for the hair,It was easy to use and also nice for the hair. The price is also affordable for 6boxes with 2tubes per box.
3,hot oil treatments,"my hair's pretty dried/frizzed (from dye jobs, highlights, and straightening) so i thought i'd try the hot oil treatments bc i'd heard a lot of good things baout it etc etc. it was ehhh. maybe my hair's TOO beat up for this to have made any sorta effect on it, but it WAS pretty soft post wash...my hair just didn't lose much of its frizz if any...."
1,"Didn't work at all, don't bother",I tried this product on both my daughter and myself and it didn't work at all. My daughter has very long thick and wavy hair and we thought it would moisturize the ends. Nothing! so I tried in on my fine straight hair thinking maybe her hair was just too thick to notice a difference. still nothing. don't waste your money on this product. there are other cheaper ones that work much better.
3,"This is not a ""3 Pack""","Excellent keyboard, however the title ""3 PK"", price (over $200) and shipping weight (17 lbs) lead me to believe it was a ""3 pack"" of OEM keyboards, but this only arrives as one unit."
4,Nice keyboard,"I've used this model keyboard for the last two years. I very much like it, despite not being a fan of most ""ergonomic"" keyboards."
1,Misleading Name - Not a 3 pack,"This is just one keyboard and one mouse. Not sure what the "". . .3 Pack"" on the end of the product description is supposed to mean.Great keyboard, but you can get it much cheaper."
2,Musica de fondo,"El disco me pareció pésimo para los estandards de Fito Páez. Le falta vida, y mucho corazón. La canciones parecen seguir para siempre, indefinidamente. La época de Phil Ramone terminó hace tiempo, pero Fito se olvidó de éste hecho. El disco es bueno para música de fondo y basta."
2,Fito esta quemado!!!,"Me resisto a creer que Fito, creador de piezas tan finas como ""Si Disney despertase"", haya dado la ultima como artista. En general creo que al disco le falta el elemento sorpresa y aparte de que Fito ya no canta ni escribe como antes. El colmo es que la introduccion de ""Yo tengo algo mejor"" mas bien suena a Jeff Beck."
4,Exelente pero demaciado denso,"Es un disco exelente para oirse una y otra vez..... despues de oirlo en partes primero. Es exelente en cuento a letras, emociones y arreglos. Es mas descriptivo que el Fito habitual y uno puede encontar mas elementos en sus canciones con los cuales indentificarse. Pero el dicos es demaciado denso para escucharse de un golpe la primera vez, tien demaciados ritmos experimentales que al final se terminan comprendiendo pero al principio es dificil oir todos. Las mejores canciones son ""Al lado del camino"" y ""la casa desaparecida"". Esta ultima esta un poco larga pero el cambio de ritmo es exelente y despues de 5 oidas uno le entiende perfectamente de que trata. Uno de coleción."
5,Snuggle up with Snuggle,"Snuggle really softens and makes laundry smell great. The downside is that the bottle is so small. I use extra on extra-large loads. We especially like the white lavender & sandlewood scent...particularly great on sheets and towels! The scent is subtle, yet relaxing."
5,Snuggle Softner,"The Snuggle rinse is a very good product, however you need to find a better way to pack and ship it. The bottle caps were not on tight and it was a mess when I unpacked it. I had the same problem with the Tide, as did the last time I ordered it. I'm tired of complaining about this situation ( as I'm sure you are tired of hearing about it). In the future, Iwill not order anything that is in liquid form."
3,It Is An OK Choice,"I am not sure how they consider this to be 3x concentrated. I definitely do not use less of it to acheive the desired results. To be honest, I would have to say that it takes more of this product than Downy (my usual brand) to get decent, noticeable softness. I do like the scent though. It is subtle, yet pretty and is fine for menswear as well as women's and children's. It is not an overpowering scent and it does linger."
4,"Good product, not my favorite scent.","I like Snuggle fabric softners, my favorite is Melon and Lotus flower (the green one)."
1,Very poor quality/dry rot,"I bought 4 balls, and my dog has destroyed 3 of them in a matter of 2 days. The balls crack and come apart in pieces."
2,Soccer balls,I received two soccer balls and one had a hole in it and becomes flat when the dog puts it in their mouth! My dog loves these balls but I will not order them again. Too much money
1,Latex Balls,"I bought these balls for my 9 year old Doxie! The bill came to a little over $22.00! After given her a ballWithin 3 minutes it was ripped in half. The balls are paper thin and they should not cost what they did!They would be fine if she had no teeth. I just wish I knew how durable they were going to be. I wouldnot recommend them. For the cost of them, not worth the money at all . Very Dissapointed!"
2,"Right Size, not sturdy enough","We have a small dog who absolutely loves balls. Found one at Petsmart which was perfect and they lasted a long time. However we have since been informed at Petsmart that the manufacturer of that ball no longer makes them!! This one is the right size, 2 inch, but my dog would chew through this thin plastic in a few minutes!! Definitely overpriced for the short time it would last."
2,Dog loves ball - Hates certain colors - NO COLOR CHOICE,"My dog loves this ball and I use to buy them at a pet store until they no longer carried them. Now, I order them through Amazon (great company).BUT... The item description states assorted colors: RED - PURPLE - WHITE. My dog ONLY likes the white ball and snubs her nose at the other colors.I've ordered these in orders of three and out of 15 balls I only received one white ball. We should have the CHOICE to order the color we want.Seriously...If I order 3 balls... Why not send me all three colors? Today I received the order and got ALL three in RED! Geez!COLOR SELECTION SHOULD BE THE BUYER'S CHOICE NOT THE PERSON FILLING THE ORDER!"
2,A Let Down,Thickness of the latex varies throughout the ball. Some places are so thin you can put your fingernail through it just by throwing it for the dog. Very disappointed.
5,Similar to Petsmart ball,"This ball is similar to the tiny soccer ball we used to get at Petsmart. The ball is purple, but my dog doesn't mind. I'm going to stock up because my dog will probably destroy it pretty quickly, and I've had trouble finding suitable replacements for the Petsmart ball since they apparently don't sell it anymore."
1,Disappointed,This item is not as advertised. I did not receive a black and white soft soccer ball. I received three very hard ball in odd colors and one purple ball that was paper thin and barely ( I do mean barely) holds air! I would not recommend this product.
3,dog balls,We purchased the balls because our dog loved those kinds and we couldn't find any locally. We bought lots of them to last awhile. Half of them were low on air or almost flat. The others were fine. We hope to use a pump to blow them up when we need them. Haven't tried it yet but hopefully it will work.
2,Disappointment,I ordered two of these balls. They arrived yesterday. One ball was completely deflated and the other one was about half-deflated. Very disappointing.
4,A good kit,I bought this kit in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.I found the kit to be a great starter kit. It contains most of what a person would need to survive for 3 days. I would recommend using this as a base kit and add to it. The kit comes with a candle but no flash light or radio. I would recommend the kit maker include a flash light and a small radioin the future. Overall a good kit to start with.
5,Worth your $$ and time.,"Although written in 1943, very informative. B/c DeHaan was a physician, his insight is unique and eye-opening as he applies it to the Word of God. A book worth rereading and sharing with friends. I will read anything by Dr. DeHaan."
1,illustrations?,"I would just like to say that from the cover of the book, it is misleading from the Brothers Grimm version of Cinderella. There isn't a pumpkin, mice, a glass slipper, and there is only one horse. I think that the illustrator needs to check the actual Grimm story."
5,Everlasting Memory,"This gently illustrated book reflects a lullaby that I learned in 1956 at a Girls Scout Camp. It stayed with me throughout the years as I sang it to my children, their children, and now one great-grandchild. I have given this book to each generation for them to share with their offsprings. They have kept and cherished the book (and sing the song themselves to their children)."
5,BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND STORY,"My 28 mos old loves ""Baby's Boat."" He was 3 months premature and had a slight speech delay; but I have no doubt this book has played a part in his love of reading and sped up his talking. He asks for this book every night by name. Yesterday, I was stunned when I saw him holding the book and ""reading"" each page from memory by looking at the pictures. I'm absolutely amazed how far he's come in his development thanks to sweet books like this. I almost forgot to mention how beautiful the iluustrations are!"
2,Too much trouble,"Sadly, I have never assembled this house. Would it be impossible to produce wood pieces without 5 million splinters? Would it be impossible to have pre-cut pieces for the windows, door frames, etc? The instructions are pretty well-written..well enough for me to realize this would be a very time-consuming project. The biggest turn-off was realizing I couldn't just start assembling..every piece must be painted first, unless you like headaches later on. The absolute worst thing is the stairs..which alone would take forever to cut out and build! Some people with lots of patience and time on their hands might welcome this tedious project. Me, I ordered an already assembled house."
1,Defective DVD,"Although I have an excellent, nearly new DVD player, this DVD continually froze in the latter half hour and was impossible to play. I ordered a replacement and it had the same problem."
4,wahoo?,"very good, nice quality, the rubber boot holds the spark plug in almost too tight though, so basically it almost works too good. the double swivel action is a life saver"
3,Disappointing,"When I heard about the title of this book and the breed featured I ordered it. I was disappointed to read the book and discover that the riding school was not the Spanish Riding School and the horse featured really could have been any other breed. To add insult to injury it was not a dressage horse. If I had written the book I would have made it more historical and with a cavalry/dressage focus instead of hunter/jumper.I gave the book three stars because I thought that it was a cute story but I would have rather seen it not proclaimed as a ""story of a majestic lippizan(er) horse."""
5,links,"arrived quickly. reasonably difficult to get the old ones off (may have to cut them off), these are super easy to install though and they have a grease fitting which is nice."
3,Pretty heavy duty. Kit includes just 1 link,"This sway bar link kit is pretty heavy duty and has improved the ride on my 2005 chrysler town and country. I was unsure if the Kit included 1 or 2 links. I was hoping for $40 dollars that it included two, but alas it is only 1. Just wanted to let others know this, since I couldn't tell from other reviews or product description. Guess I'll have to order another one. Seems a bit spendy for just one link. Also, was a b*tch to get the old ones off. I ended up grinding off the old bolts, but very hard to get the grinder in the right place."
2,Beware - Audio cable is short!,The audio portion of the cable is short. I cannot plug it in when the VGA portion is connected to my Thinkpad T60.
2,Audio cord too small,The cable itself is good but the audio cord is too small and hardly of any use. It will only reach the video and audio on a laptop if both outputs are on same side. no matter how small the laptop or netbook is. Very bad design makes it useless!
3,So So,"In my personal opinion, this is a bad interpretation of Lyapunovs works. It is too fast and is constantly blurred. Hardly any pedal. It did ship fast, and it has what it says it has."
1,First CD Energy is superb - the other two are filler!,"I have to agree with the previous post - the first CD (energy) is simply a joy to play! Every cut on it is excellent! The music is uplifting, calming, and just plain fun. I have played this cd many times and have yet to tire of it. The other two Cds just don't have the same appeal - I played them once and never put them back into my cd player. I paid $9.99 for the three cds and still feel like I got a bargain. If I use the other two as coasters, I still have the energy cd. That alone was worth the $10.00 to me! It says 1 star, but I meant to give it a 4!"
2,The first CD is good. The other two...well...,"I just bought this 3 CD set a few days ago...and I'm somewhat disappointed. The first CD ""Energy"" is fantastic...all the tracks are guitar, percussion and other select instruments, but they are great. The second CD ""Positivity"" is strange. The music was just...not something that seemed ""positive"". It's not uplifting except for maybe 2 tracks. The third CD ""Sleep Well"" is not exactly what I'd call ""something to help you sleep better"". It gave me a headache.I purchased this CD set for $10 and I'm upset...but I'm still having a blast listening to the first CD. So, if you want a CD that'll make you move and get you to smile and be happy...buy this set only for the ""Energy"" CD. Besides...$10 for one CD isn't bad. I was just expecting more from a three CD set."
3,"Three Stars for ""Entertaining 1 2 3""","Although the concept is one that appealled to me, namely receipts with only three ingredients, I was a little disappointed because some of the required items were unfamiliar to me, and all but unattainable at my local market. I did, however, find a number of receipts that sound good enough to try with everyday ingredients."
5,Latex Puppy Pacifiers,I have two small dogs and they just love these puppy pacifiers. I senttwo to a friend who also has two small dogs and her dogs loved them also.They have had hours of fun playing and shaking these toys...I will be buying more in the near future.
1,A Flimsey Piece of Junk,"I was disappointed as soon as I unwrapped it. It's flimsey and hollow. No substance to it. My 18-pound Shiba Inu puppy was very much attracted to the color and the squeaker, and although he is not hard on toys, this one lasted about two seconds. I was hoping it would at least last long enough to get a cute picture of him with it in his mouth but couldn't even get my money's worth in that regard either. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,too weak and fragile for a real puppy who is teething,"I bought this item for my border collie mix pup who is teething and was also 'nursing' her bed. I was hoping she might suck on this thing instead and it would soothe her, but it's too weak so she ended up shredding it to bits. I couldn't even send it back because it ended up being ingested and I wasn't willing to dig the bits out of her poop. It might have worked had it been made of stronger latex."
1,Didn't last.......,My Westie puppy (16lbs) chewed through it in 5 minutes! Waste of money and we were so excited to purchase because we have a baby that kept getting his stolen...............
3,"Trail, not for eveyone.....","I don't know about you, but I won't drive for an hour just to go to some trails to skate. The ""How-to"" section is not great, you better be a pretty good skater to use this book. The trail map, none of them I can reach without driving for an hour. Maintaining section, I've seen better. If you like skating on trails and happened to live beside one, this book is for you."
5,A genuine masterpiece,"Tisto is a legend in this genre, and it's proven with all of his Magik albums. He has never disappointed me, and I was in awe when I first listened to this CD. It opens beautifully with the song 'Eternity' written by Tisto and the great Armin Van Buuren. I've often wondered what a song would sound like that was written by both of these trance gods, and this song was everything I could ever imagine. The album proceeds strongly, but I feel that it reaches its first peak at 'Open Your Mind' by Yahel. This is a gorgeous song, starting off with strong bass and a building melody, but then it slows in the center and becomes melancholy and almost angelic. The CD continues on without a dull song, and it finishes in a wondrous finale. Overall, this album is a must-have for any Tisto fans, trance lovers, or anybody searching for deep, uplifting music."
5,A wonderful trance album with no lyrics,"Finally, a techno CD that has good rhythms but no annoying lyrics! I'm a fan of a wide-array of sub-genres in the Electronica sphere, but I don't like lyrics. It is difficult to find good songs without lyrics, but Tiesto managed to pull it off with Magik 5: Heaven Beyond.This is one of the best techno albums I've heard, with tracks 2 and 16 being a couple of my favorites. If you want smooth trance, without all of the annoying moaning of modern-day music, then pick this album up. I have confidence that you'll enjoy it as much as I have."
3,Hawaiinan Paradise,"This CD is a good round exposure to Alfred Apaka. His voice is so soothing and deep, a wonderful Hawaiian experience. MY copy came in in wonderful condition."
3,A collection of rare stuff. For fans and collectors.,"This 22-track album is a collection of of previously released 7 inches, B-sides, contributions to compilations and live recordings made between 1991 and 1993, which are no longer available anywhere else. The quality of the songs varies greatly, with some excellent moments (""Flameproof Suit"", ""World Tour"") alternating with some pretty mediocre ones. I guess this is an album for fans and collectors. Other people might be a bit disappointed."
2,Mediocre 90's Indie Guitar Rock,"The compilation, a collection of b-sides and hard to find tracks from several years of Tsunami's career in the early 90's, is largely a collection of tuneless, squalling songs that have little regard for melody or structure. Even the more straightforward songs lack interesting hooks: most of the playing is very primitive, and not in a good way, in a boring way. The singer's voice is powerful, but very few of the songs do anything interesting, and they are not worth seeking out in this 70 minute mess."
5,"Yes, Yes, Yes","Delicious. Uplifting. Reaffirming. Intoxicating. Necessary. (In other words: Get it, sit down, listen!)"
2,A disappointment,"Coleman Barks may be a brilliant translator, but this CD was a disappointment, mostly because of the slip-shod music production. Something more rehearsed, with better sounds and creative energy would have been nice. The mood of the text is completely contradicted by the cheesy music. And for anyone that says, ""well, I bet you couldn't do better."" Try me. (I'm a music producer and Rumi enthusiast, and I have half a mind to see just what I can do. Give me a call Mr. Barks - w w w . m i n d s p e a k . c o m"
2,It's hard to take it seriously,"I LOVE Rumi's poetry, and I love Coleman Barks' translations. I've been a fan for a number of years now, but this was the first time I've ever heard him speak. He has a Southern accent and sounds like a ""good ol' boy"" reading these amazing, enlightening words. It really is hard to take it seriously as Middle Eastern poetry from the 13th century when the reader sounds like he's from Dukes of Hazard. It's pretty bad."
3,"I want burning:The Ecstatic World of Rumi, Hafiz and Lalla","Wonderful idea, good music, but Coleman Bark's voice just doesn't fit."
1,Abomination,"This was the WORST rendition of Rumi poetry reading I have ever suffered through-it was painful to listen to what sounded like a Native American Hick read in a monotone unemotional manner this beautiful poetry. I even shared it with three other very enlightened spiritual people because I thought it might just be my personal opinion, but they asked me to turn it off! It was Like drinking sour milk!"
2,Buyer Beware,The slate in this coffee table is not adequately glued causing damage to the table during shipping and it falls out when you invert the table for assembly.
5,I love the golfers christmas carols,Very Funny!!!!!! I loved the Mulligan song. i own the cd and it is grat to listen to. I don't play golf much but this is one exception to the golfers way of doing things
2,barely decent.,"This is good for the people that like the slow house groove, but if you are like me and you like fast Denzil Slemming type techno, the SDF series from AVEX Japan just doesnt do it anymore. They rarely have a decent techno or eurodance tune on there anymore, and most of them are now-a-days very easily attainable, making the CD less worth the money. If you want good CDs from the SDF series, Volumes 20-60 are much better than the 70s (Trust me, I have them all). Best song on this CD is (Gouryella)-Gouryella."
5,Wow!,"Brian Lumley really did a good job on this one. I couldn't put the book down until I had solved every mystery right along with the main character in the book.If you have loved Mr. Lumley's other books, then you are going to love this one just as well."
3,Less Thrilling Than Psychomech,"Hmm, espionage, esp, I wonder what Brian Lumley likes to write about?Book two in Brian Lumley's Psychomech trilogy. I found it a little less interesting than the first one. It started dragging and I didn't feel for the lead character Richard Garrison as much as I did in the previous story."
5,Excellent,"I didn't think I would ever be able to buy this limited-edition CD, but I was thrilled to receive a brand new unopened copy in the mail after I purchased it on Amazon."
3,NOT NECESSARY,"I'm a U2 fan, which means that I want every version of every U2 song ever made. This does not mean, however, that I'm gonna spend money on many copies of the same songs.I'm a kid, I don't make much money and I don't want to buy unnecessary songs.If you want these songs, by all means buy them. I want more songs, however.If one were to purchase ""The Complete U2"" from the US iTunes store, they would only be missing ""Stuck In A Moment..."" from this CD. That song was recently itself made available in the iTunes store."
3,complicated,The book was full of information that was very confusing. If you think you will get straight information from this book like if your horse is this or that then do this or that. You will not
1,a comedy classic,"""Cauldron"" by fifty foot hose is a 5 star classic if the catagory is comedy. I have yet to listen to this record (yes I own the vinyl lp.) without bursting into laughter. It is truly a product of the times, a time when major labels would sign ANYTHING from San Francisco in hopes of tapping into the new music scene. What Fifty Foot Hose does to a beautiful song like ""God Bless the Child"" is unforgivable unless they were going for laughs. They'er plenty of laughs on this collection and if a listener begins with that approach,....this is a riot! HIGHly recommended..............."
2,Neither worth the time nor the money!,"This is a poorly written book. In additon to its numerous spelling and grammer errors, its flow of information is diffcult to follow, and the author's bias in interprtation of events is mostly annoying. It may serve as agood reference for bibliography in a mediocre college papar about Iran, but that's about it. It most certainly did not woth either my tome or my money."
5,Celebrates big women's sexuality & sensuality,"This erotic short story anthology is about the sensual enjoyment of big women and those who love them. They're hot and full of delight and humour. There is lesbian and hetersexual content. Try page 95! Several of the short story authors I recognized from Hot and Bothered and Best Lesbian Erotica. A good read, especially for voluptuous women."
5,I wish...,"I wish the behind the scenes focused on Rich and Wandy rather then Marcus Davis and Dan Hardy, but other than that great for any UFC fan. Good stuff."
5,Wonderful movie,This was a great movie to watch . Its for kids and adults Very interesting and really put together well.
4,A Bargain!,"Arrived as promised and the movie has been enjoyed by all (perfect for my 10-year old Granddaughter)...great for family viewing, as are all the Hallmark movies I have purchased to dateArrived in a timely manner...have not viewed all the movies as of yet."
4,GOOD FAMILY MOVIES,"I GAVE THIS TO A RELIGOUS FAMILY AND THEY SAID THEY ENJOYED IT AND MOST WAS SUITABLE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, AND THEY ARE VERY STRICT WITH WHAT THEY ALLOW THIER KIDS TO WATCH."
5,What I expected,When I bought this item itwas explained the way I excepeted it to be. They were very nice and item was recieved on time.
3,Some repeats,"this was a good set, but repeated in one of the other ""pacs"" i got online. Wish they had listed the movie titles on the web so I could see that I was ordering duplicates the 2 orders...that was disappointing. but passed them on to the Library so they could be shared with lots of people!``"
5,nice,"brand new and good movies, nice family movies and heart warming. plays perfect and got it very early, thankyou so much"
1,Shaver Cord Review,This cord does not fit a Remington Titanium shaver at all. This was a bad buy for myself.
5,Power Cord a Perfect Fit,"I have used the same Norelco Rotary Shaver every day since 1991. After 20 years of bending, the power cord had problems carrrying an electrical current so I taped the sections together. The shaver worked for a few more days, but finally the cord gave out. I ordered this cord which fits perfectly and hopefully am good for another 20 years."
1,not quite universal,"When I purchased this item it claimed to ""fit most"" norelco electric razors. Well, the razor I have is about as standard as they come and it is not compatib5le. Now it is just a worthless piece of plastic to me. I think this fits models from maybe 7-10 years ago, don't be fooled."
1,Doesn't Fit,"Said it fits most norelco shavers...It does not. My family has 3 norelcos and they all have the same plug and this didn't fit any of them. I should have paid more attention, but this doesn't fit any norelco shaver I have had in the last 10 years. Be careful and look before you by."
1,waste of money,Didn't come close to fitting my Norelco QT4021.. Not even worth my time to ship back for a refund.. Not a good buy on my part
3,Cylob - Mood Bells,"It is what it says on the tin......pure mood bells..(im suprsed at the ignorance of the previous review who thought it might sound like Aphex Twin or Squarepusher just becasue it is released on rephlex records)...if thats what your looking for this is not like either of those artists....Definetly a record to relax too,very well constructed, the changing shape of the bells will have you hypnotised an retreating inside your own mind.. if you have the patience to listen to this record to the end..certainly not cylobs most accesable record but a good one for those of us who like a little something different..:)"
1,What did I waste my money on?,"I wasted my money on this CD. Please don't be another victim, read this review. Okay, first off, I'm a big fan of ambient music. Aphex Twin's Ambient Works Vol. 2 is one of the best I've heard in my life. Then I had the misfortune of picking up Mood Bells by Cylob while I was looking around for something new and interesting at the music store.This entire CD is just bells. That's it. Different sounding bells, being bent and shaped and warped into imaginative sounds, but unfortunately not any type of song I'd care to listen to for longer than ten minutes.In fact that CD began to annoy me at the ten minute mark so I removed it from my player promptly. If you like the sound of bells and bells only, then I suggest you grab this album. If bells don't tickle your fancy, I suggest you try one of Cylob's other albums or just about anything by Aphex Twin or Squarepusher.(On a sidenote, this album is released under Aphex Twin's record label.)"
5,Wonderful beautiful book!,I had already seen the IMAX movie on Dolphins and was amazed and more awed by them then before and I didn't think that was possible! Dolphins are my favorite animal and for good reason. Next to humans they are the smartest creature on earth and unfortunately us humans are killing them! The movie doesn't really go in to that neither does the book.........but had to say it. Anyways the book is large and beautifully illustrated! Covers several topics and isn't boring at all! The pictures alone make the book worth it!
3,Accuracy checks?,"I would have liked to rate this higher, but I came across 2 notable errors. On page 10, the author states that the Israelites had enough gold as slaves in Egypt to later melt for the golden calf. However, Exodus 12:35-36 states that the Egyptians gave them gold prior to them leaving Egypt.Secondly, on pages 24-25, the author says that a 12 oz. troy pound (5,760 grains) is equal to a 16 oz. avoirdupois pound (7,000 grains) in weight. Not so. A troy pound is equal to 14.583 avoirdupois ounces, not 16.Lastly, the author rather lightly treats the U.S. government's confiscation (no longer ""legal tender"") of citizen's gold coins in 1934 @ $20.67/oz. & then re-valuing gold at $35/oz., with private ownership restrictions finally lifted by 1975."
1,stable currency or unlimited printing of paper money?,"after reading it, two very simple questions popped into my mind... is Gold really that bad? a stable currency... or a paper money that can be printed unlimitedly as the government like, which eventually create inflation, or destroying value of other nation's reserves or the wealth of the world while for one nation's gains?"
2,Don't waste your time,"Written with minimal thought and a bare command of the language, and obiously published without the benefit of a competent editor, this mediocre book is irritating to read at best. Here's my favorite sentence so far (p.50 & I don't think I'm going to make it much farther): ""What with everything, Diocletian was exhausted by the burdens of being emperor."" Never mind the power of gold; if you value your time you won't waste it on this book."
4,"Dense, somewhat boring but will probably endure","It appears from the obvious publisher-placed comments that I may be one of the few people who has actually READ this book. With his no-doubt legions of researchers, Peter Bernstein obviously has his facts at hand, and they are plentifully strewn throughout the book. But this is not a business book, it is a history book about the enduring lure of the element Au. It took me about a week to finish this, and I found much of it interesting. But overall, I thought that it read like a well-researched thesis that will probably stand the test of time. There are some truly fascinating stories in it, and it is well written, but don't expect this book to tell you how to find gold or how to make enough money to buy gold. It is what it is: the history of a metal that has never lost its lustre."
3,2000 Edition has more text,"The older edition (Aug 30, 2000) has more pages (448 instead of 304) but costs more ($39.00). Comparing the table of contents between the 2 editions, it appears that the first 14 chapters and 207 pages are identical between the two editions but the new 2004 illustrated edition may have discarded or condensed some of the later chapters. The older 2000 edition is still available from Amazon if you look further down in search results for this title."
4,As good as gold,"Except for a brief explanation of what gold is, and a few of the major gold rushes, ""The Power of Gold"" is essentially the economic history of gold. That isn't neccessarily a bad thing, the only major flaw with the book in my opinion is when the Europeans/Americans wrangle over the gold standard. The last section involving how much gold is a dollar or a pound is just plain dull. However, most of the book a fascinating look at our fascination with the magic metal. My favorite history books are written by novices, since the author usually enjoys his subject enough to write about it, and Bernstein does have an enthusiasm over his subject that is infectious. So, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of gold or even modern money."
3,More a history of the monetary-gold nexus than that of gold itself,"The first part of the tape provides a history of gold per se. The remainder provides a history of gold backed currency (until the collapse of the gold standard). Very little, if any, history of gold is provided for modern times, especially regarding use in industry, in jewelry and as a form of wealth preservation in the third world. Very little on production in modern times."
5,Power of gold,"Very in depth book on monetary perspective of gold through the ages. Explains how the change in the supply of gold affected various European country economies thru the ages. The book is written from a Western perspective. The author explains how changes in the supply of gold/M1 causes inflation or deflation in Europe during the Middle ages and more recent times. There are one or two inconsistancies between early chapters and later chapters. Overall, a very readable book for someone interested in the economic world around us."
2,Disappointing,With such a rich subject matter I thought he could have done much better with this book. I am having to force myself to finish it.
3,Some Bad Pages,I just started reading my paper-back version and noticed a few pages where the printing is extremely light and barely there (printing problem).I will definitely need my reading glasses and a strong light for those pages.
3,ERROR,"page 44""A pound was equal to 20 shillings and a shilling was equal to twelve pence - a system that lasted from Norman times unntil the 1980's, when Britain finally yielded and adopted the decimal denominations long in use everywher else.""page 197""Britain .. abandoned their historic shillings and pence for the metric sysyem in 1969.""It was infact 15th Febuary 1971A date etched on my mind even though I was in short trousers !A good book spoiled by a silly error !!"
3,All That Glitters,"Here's a scholarly work that won't bog you down with technical terms but rather keeps you in stride with the author--whether he is searching for the whereabouts of Roman coins (Hm, where DID they all go?) or down in the bowels of Fort Knox eyeing gold bricks. The Power of Gold is a great read for science and history junkies. I predict it will be a much-talked-about (and cited) study for years to come."
1,shoddy research,"The Power of Gold is full of amazing and entertaining stories, so much so that I started to get suspicious about the scholarship of the work. I haven't got the patience to track down every story, but suffice it to say that the one story I did bother to research turned out to be bunk. On pp. 29-30, Bernstein describes a meeting between Solon and Croesus. I recall that Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in his book ""Fooled by Randomness"" (p. 10 of FBR) mentions that it ""was chronologically impossible for the two men to have been the same location."" Turns out, Taleb was right (no surprise there), but this casts serious doubt on the many wonderful stories that Bernstein blithely reports as fact. Bernstein should rename his book, ""The Power of Cute Fairy Tales about Gold."""
2,Dismal new illustrated edition of a great book,"Because the first edition of the Power of Gold was a best-seller, the publisher saw advantage in preparing an illustrated edition. In this latter work, the chapters have been hastily and mercilessly chopped up, shortened or eliminated, presumably to make the book more readable to a large public. It is so bad that at times the text has become ununderstandable. On a positive note, the images are nice."
5,A WHALE ON HER OWN-THE TRUE STORY OF WILMA THE BELUGA WHALE,"A WHALE ON HER OWN is a charming story of a young beluga whale who decided to make Chedabucto Bay her home for a while. Jim Johnson, an old time sea traveller and scuba diver got to be friends with Wilma and explained alot about beluga whales and their habits while describing their adventures together. Although told in a story format, the book is quite informative with definitions of terms at the end along with book listings and websites to pursue if this book has piqued your interest. Brian Skerry has done an absolutely striking job with the photography. It really makes this more than a good story and more than a way for young people to learn about beluga whales. It makes this book an exceptional treasure for library, classroom or personal collection."
5,Cool gift idea,This is a great phone. I scored big points with my wife when I got it for her for her birthday. She loves it and she wants to order one for her Mom as well.
1,Mislabeled product and we should have returned! DON'T ORDER!,"The product was advertised as for Fine Hair but someone had put a hand label on the box stating this. The tube said it was for normal hair and the cream was yellow and runny. I've been trying to find the Vo5 for Fine Hair for my 87 year old mother in stores but I don't think they make it anymore. She didn't tell me this until now and she just threw the product away. This was the last supposedly ""Extra Body for Fine Hair"" tube here and I should really have gotten my money back... If you see a product that is hand and mis-labeled, mail it back immediately!"
1,"Ugh, horrible!","I bought this product in store, thinking it was a cream conditioner I had used many moons ago. Little did I realize that it's essentially Vaseline and it won't wash out!!! Now my hair looks like an oil slick, and 6 shampoos later, my hair still looks like I was involved in a head-on collision with an oil tanker. Now I'm stuck googling ""how to remove vaseline from hair"".... be warned!!!!"
1,Battery Rejected by Camcorder,I purchased two batteries and neither worked in the camcorder.The camcorder (Sony DCR-PC10) rejects the batteries as not an InfoLithium battery.The batteries weren't expensive and I didn't try to return them to the vendor. I wrote off the experience as a bad purchase.
4,Very Original worth the rental,"I really enjoyed this movie. I never heard of it so it was a pleasant surprise. I don't agree w/ the guy who said it's a lifetime movie. It's an indie film....and if you have seen enough of them you should appreciate this movie.I did like the backwards to foward effect of the movie. However there is a part of the movie that is a little far fetched.Why didn't Page just follow through w/ calling Adult services? The extreme measures she takes to save Jacob did not seem realistic.However, I did like this movie, it kept my attention, and as I said it was Very original. Take the time to rent this one. If you are an Indie fan you should enjoy it."
3,No ending,"Previous reviewers have recounted the basic storyline quite accurately. Although the movie will draw you in very quickly, two things will leave you disappointed: 1) The decision by ""Paige"" to remove Jacob from his ""situation"" was completely unbelievable. It seemed to come out of nowhere and requires more than a suspension of disbelief. An otherwise good storyline went south. Another 2 or 3 scenes could have made it believable, instead it comes across as an 8th graders first attempt at writing a story. 2)I still have no idea what the ending is supposed to be. I'm looking for something I've missed to make this a little more interesting but have yet to find it. Either I'm really stupid, or there really is no ending of any kind other than the obvious. And if that was it...well.... then I think Parker needed to spend a few more days figuring out something more satisfying. Decent enough to watch. Maybe you can figure out what was supposed to be happening at the end!"
4,Something different,Entertainment for a slow Friday night. If you get through the first 17 minutes you'll enjoy this one. Different and engaging. Not for the comedy/big-explosion crowd.
4,Scalene,"Marlo Martindale, always love the people she plays,is great in this movie. Going from present to past and past to present and each characters view of the events was very different. This is a movie I would watch again because I'm sure I missed something the first time."
2,Scalene: Terrible ending nothing is resolved. Be warned.,"The movie was slow moving and ok, but the ending was terrible and did not resolve anything. If you like a movie that leaves you hanging, this is it."
3,"Not so Great, more of a 2 1/2 star","The movie started a bit quirky. Kinda reminded me of Harry Potter. At first I thought it was gonna be a comedy, how it started off but kept me interested. I guess its good to read what the movie is about before watching, otherwise you might be a bit lost. So knowing there are 3 different point of views, the mothers, the son and the caretaker. What was disappointing was the ending. I am not sure what happened to the caretaker? The decision the caretaker made was horrible stupid. She hurt so many innocent people, her parents, the disabled guy, including herself. She should have turned in the mother like she planned to do in the first place."
3,Weak Ending,"What happened to days when all of the story's loose ends would be tied-up by the completion of the movie. ""Scalene"" is an interesting movie, especially because it gives some insight into what it is like to raise a special-needs child. I watched this movie primarily to see how accurate those challenges would be portrayed. Unfortunately, when this movie is over there are still many unanswered questions."
2,Fair to Poor,I was leery of this video rental. I should have listened to my instinct. I found this video to be lacking in character development and a poorly presented plot.I still can't figure out what the story was about? Who were these people and why are we getting their story?
4,made to be good drama and it was,This was made to be entertaining drama. It is a traji-comedy. The comedy is driven by the character of Jacob's mother and the trajedy by her son. She brings a pleasing lightness to the tale by her voluable emotions. She is histrionic and wilful and a mother hen to her chick but all this in a deadly earnest so she still has to be taken seriously.However she is also self-centred and devious or are these negative traits an outcome of wishing she didn't always have to be mother hen.Whatever- the pleasing lightness does not derail the film by making it trite and the darker and sad undertones invoke empathy always through Jacob who is realistically acted. The care-giver was well played also.The film was made to be moving and entertain and it delivered.Otherwise it is not particularly sophisticated but many films aren't and it never pretended to be.
4,Wow...Good film!,"This was a very good movie!Unpredictable,well acted and engaging.I HIGHLY recommend it for either renting or purchasing.You won't regret it.Just watch it and see for yourself!"
1,Waste of time,"Slow pacing, poor acting ... why was this called a ""thriller""?I don't know why I kept watching, I think I was hoping something more would come of it. In the end, a total waste of time."
4,A Rising Star,"One of Zack Parker's biggest film influences is Stanley Kubrick and it shows in SCALENE. The film is about perspective and the director uses every corner of the frame to create unique perspectives for each character, and at times one is reminded of Kubricks ""moving pictures"" (as I like to call them) where nothing on screen is merely what one sees. Margo Martindale lends pathos to a seemingly unsympathetic character while Hannah Hall adds deep shadows to a character most actors wouldn't have given more than two dimensions. Adam Scarimbola does a superb job acting with very limited dialogue. The film was shot on a microbudget with a very talented, local crew (most from Indiana) and is evidence of this young director's growth since his previous film QUENCH. If you're tired of the same weekend box office premieres and would like to entertain your brain then I recommend this film."
1,The director's friends say they love it,"This movie is mediocre. The plot is no where near ""mind-blowing."" The acting isn't horrible but the characters are a little too amateur to watch for the length of the movie . The script could have been written by a 14 year old. I didn't find the camera work all that effective. The end was like finding out you've gone on a one way street with no outlet it . It was dismal, but not in any sort of artsy, intelligent, or believable way. If it was supposed to create an ethical dilemma, it failed miserably.The majority of 5 star reviews were all posted in August of this year. It's like there was an onslaught of friends promoting the film. Those reviews either don't really say anything substantial or they are written as if by paid movie critics. The most flowery review is the only review posted by that person. I depend on reviews, and for this film, I think they are bogus.I don't recommend this movie."
1,Junk,"Bought these at local Autozone - cheap and poorly made. Easy to break, tangs don't line up. Quick disconnect mechanism is light-duty at best making the stability of the tool very poor. I couldn't extract snap ring with this tool."
1,Snap-Ring Pliers,"Broke on the very first snap ring I tried them on.The hinge is a light-weight pressed piece of aluminum and twisted into a heapof nothing right away like a soda can. Very frustrating.Looked promising in the description, but I had to return them as they were use-less."
1,Worst quality: do not buy,"I had a horrendous experience. On the first try, one of the tips broke off. The package has an additional replacement for the straight ahead application, so I simply replaced it. The same result: on the first try, the tip broke off. I was attempting to remove the snap ring on my bicycle trainer hub, which is apparently equal to an industrial type snap ring. After two of them breaking on each of their first application, its obvious to me that a replacement would not have remedied the situation."
1,"Meh, not worth it",it's not well constructed. The material on the upper shoes is of poor quality. I bought this pair due to Rockport brand but is disappointed with this product. Hardly ever wear it now.
5,unique insights into football during the 70's,"An excellent review of NFL football during the 1970s. The chapters in the book are based on interviews with various players, coaches, and broadcasters from the era, getting some unique insights based on the questions the author asked during the interview. Also contains some photographs and statistics from the era as well. Very, very readable. If you are a fan of this era, this will offer a different perspective and be an interesting addition to other conventional works written on the subject."
5,Relive 70s football,The author brings you back to the era in a most interesting and thought provoking manner. A lot of research and effort had been put into this book. Keep this book handy.
5,Why Football in the '70's Was Super,"My introduction to the NFL happened in the late 1970's, during the great Steelers/Cowboys battles for the Super Bowl. I bought this book as much to remind myself of those days, as to get a glimpse of what it was really like in the NFL for the players and coaches. What I found was that there were great players on some really good teams that didn't get the attention those big name stars received. It wasn't just Jack Ham, Lynn Swann, ""Mean"" Joe Greene, Roger Staubach, and Drew Pearson. There was Larry Little, Cedric Hardman, and Bert Jones to name a few. Throw in a little coaching, some broadcasters, even a Director of Player/Personnel, and you have a well-rounded book that covers the highs and lows of one of the best decades in football."
1,Nope,"Sorry, but I must echo the reviewer who states this elevates this decade in football to a place in history it just doesn't merit. The Super 70s is analogous to a skunk wearing an Armani suit: flashy but in the final analysis more hype and fiction than fact."
5,Classic,"Classic album from one of Sacramento's finest, Mr. Hollow Tip Nelsiano. North Highlands, Sacramento, California, that is. very hard to find. Must have for a nice collection."
5,The real story,"Matt Brennan shows you the real war, the way it real was, not just what CBS wanted you to see."
4,Ok,"Yeah, it fixes the nocking noise from the sway bar but it always comes back when the bushing wears out."
1,Easily broken into!,"I bought this to keep people from turning the heat up. I thought it was working well until I noticed it was getting warmer! I checked the thermostat and to my suprise it was turned UP!! I asked around and found out that someone had simply ""popped off"" the lid! The lid is NOT fastened to the back part of the box! It comes apart in two pieces and the person popped off the cover at the top where it's not fastened together! I am not happy at all! I did not buy this from amazon but wanted to warn everyone! I paid $19 for this piece of junk and am taking it back to the store where I bought it! My advice is to look for one that is one whole piece-- so the lid does not come off from the back!IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK... unless you're using it to guard against children since they're not strong enough to pop off the top!"
1,who measured this?,"The item is advertised to be much bigger than it is. Here are the REAL dimensions (OD), which as it turned out were too small for my need, thank you very much: 9.75""L x 7.25""W x 3.25""D.What a royal waste of my time. Hopefully it won't be of yours also."
1,Dimensions not as advertised.,"The product description on Amazon clearly says that this thermostat guard is 12 inches by 11 inches.The guard I received is much smaller - 9.75 inches by 7.25 inches.It appears to be the correct product, as it has Honeywell part number CG512A on the package.Too small for what I need, so it is going back.The product description needs to be corrected."
4,Good Product. Not 100% secure.,"This product works as described, however if you apply a small amount of force you can open the case from the top without the key. For most people just having the case over the thermostat will serve as a deterrent but for the more determined something more secure will be needed.Worked perfectly for my needs and I would buy it again."
5,Amusing and sweet -- gentle send-up of Harlequin Romances!,"I discovered this old Silhouette Romance in a dusty used bookstore, and what a treat it is. Without giving away too much of the plot, it revolves around a young woman who is an employee (editor, I believe) of the publishers of Silhouette Romance books. (Yes, we're talking about the same company that published this book!)The hero is insecure and annoyed by the absurd fantasy of these books. His mom reads them, this woman he is interested in reads them, but these ""fantasy"" stories are full of strong, handsome, rich heroes with names like ""Thorne"" and ""Rock"" and how absurd is that? He is none of these things, he thinks, and so he feels that he cannot live up to this woman's expectations.I really liked this book. There is more to this book than just the fact that this woman works for Silhouette Books, however, that detail amused me no end. Only Debbie Macomber could pull off a tale such as this!"
3,Physicians Healing Therapies,"The book only mentions all herbs and natural remedies, for that it rates 5 stars but I would have liked a separate section for ailments and dissease referring to the herbs. The section on this in the book I would have liked it to be more extensive It is a good reference book to have.Regards T.G.Huygens Tholen ND. DC."
1,Looks great but sound's awful,"Violin, case and accessories looks great but sound is awful. I bought this violin for my son who has been renting for past 1 1/2 yrs. As my violin knowledge is limited, we asked his school violin teacher and also his private teacher to check on the quality. Both of them suggested to return the violin immediately as it sounds terrible. It is not worth. I returned it on 8/21 and did not get refund yet (over 30 days)"
2,meandering narrative,"This book was disappointing in that the author dwelt too long on less important sections of the history of the region. In examining the Eastern Counties Railway, I found a concentration on a couple of individuals and not enough on the overall subject. There are better studies, such as Cecil J Allen's Great Eastern Railway."
5,A rare find!,"I'LL BE SEEING YOU, by Joyce W. Glauser, is one of the most compelling novels I've ever come across ... it's certainly the most eminently readable on the usually complex subject of Reincarnation. This fast-paced story (with its absolutely inspired flashbacks) is peppered with characters the reader is unlikely ever to forget, such are author Glauser's clever casting and plotting skills. And speaking of casting, when you reluctantly turn the last page of this gem of a book, you'll probably swear you've just been to a movie ... and a good one!Jeb Ladouceur, author: 'The Palindrome Plot' - 'Calamity Hook' - 'Frisco' - 'The Banana Belt' - 'Sparrowbush' - 'The Oba Project' - 'Mark of the Zodiac'"
1,Dyango Latin Classics .Have the Cd. Pretty Good.,"Esa Mujer is a good song, Good Singer, Kind of disappointed that he performed in communist stalinst state. no longer going to be a fan of his, no matter how good."
4,A well written exploration of Art Tatum's genius,"This book does a wonderful job explaining Art Tatum's monumental talent and the almost mythic regard in which he was held by world class jazz and even classical musicians. Forty years after his death, Tatum is still seen as a towering and intimidating presence by pianists. The book relates, in great detail, one Tatum anecdote after another by jazz legends of Tatum's startling talent. Where the book falls down though, is trying to explain Tatum, the man. I learned very little about Tatum other than his gift for music and love of playing and drinking. Overall though, an interesting read about a little known genius."
5,No More words : JUST GOOOOOOOD .....,I will make short... this is the best CD mixed live for any DJ.It was release in the 1999 but I think that in the 2009 still will make you fly into the melodies track that it have.Is wonderful compilation and track selection.Tiesto is one of the goods.Go for this CD.;)
5,frozen in time,"This cd is well ahead of its time. In my opinion, this has got to be Tiesto's harder get your ass on the floor type mix...no doubt thats exactly the reason he recoded it live at a club in Amsterdam. Slightly different than the rest of his mixed Cd's. Favorite tracks in order...Viola, forever young, gothic dream, afterburn, cloudwalking and of course silence. These tracks are nothing less than amazing! Beautiful progressive flow with all sorts of melodies, riffs, and cutbacks. A masterpiece. Perhaps the best Live mixed Cd ever made along with Ferry Corsten's live at Spundae....No doubt most trance fans know or have heard about this CD..if you havent check it out, you have everything to gain!"
3,Not that special,"Dj Tiesto is a dam good dj, but i thought that live in amsterdam was missing something. On the surface, i could just say that i didnt think there was enough melodies on this album, but i think that tiestos skill as a mixer could make almost anything sound good. This album does get better after listening to it a second time, but after listening to the whole thing in depth and really analyzing it, i found that there was sort of a loop in the way he mixed the entire album. Its really difficult to explain with only words but if you make music youll hear it. Everytime i hear the album it is confirmed too. If you hear the last minute of the album as tiesto is thanking the crowd he finnally gets a superb melody but then the album ends. The entire album is filled with awesome mixes that never reach their full potential. It s worth getting though."
2,"""Live"" == extraneous noise","I like Tiesto, but this disc doesn't do it for me. The crowd noise is too distracting. If you have heard other ""live mix"" trance discs and don't mind the cheering and whooping and whistle-blowing mixed in with your music then go ahead, you'll probably like this one too. But if you're like me and find that stuff annoying, you'd be better off with something else (Magic Vol. 5, for instance)"
2,"Pretty damn old, there's a lot of better stuff out there!!","well guys, this is for the ppl that already have experience with trance, real trance, so i think u guys should start lookin' for the new tunes, like ""Nyana"" for exampl, the latest of tiesto, the #1 Dj in the world, like Paul Oakenfold, best U.K Dj, Paul Van Dyk, Danny Tenaglia, try to reach out for the latest, the best, the most groovy, and ofcourse the trippy, lol. Enjoy!! peace."
1,i thought tiesto wouid do better than this.,"i don't want to exagurate my judgment on this complation of "" tiest"":a remixer, music producer.first this complation was made for europen audionces only,seconderey first eight tracks was a repeated europen tracks then with he starts to kick up with better selection of tracks,my opinon is a suucessful dj is who plays a set of type of music with combining all elmments of it to come up stylish set with a print of his own style,but this d.j made his with bad quality music in beging then after you'r dissappointed allready he start to recover his set littelerly after track eight,my opinon if like euro. tunes and you'r begginer in the eletronica music go for it, if you'r mature in this type of music then thinck about it again."
5,The best Magik CD,"Tiesto's mix in Amsterdam is someting else. For all Tiesto fans....you gotta get this one....undoubtedly the best cd from the Magik series....I have all tiesto albums...this one surely tops the list...The only regret i that I missed seeing him last Xmas..Check out these trax...Surreal, Forever Young, Voyage."
4,Great live set from Tiesto,"This Magik volume is a live set from DJ Tiesto in Amsterdam. It, like his stage performances, are high energy. It includes the dancefloor anthem Delerium's ""Silence"" (with Sarah McLachlan). Tiesto is fine tuning his craft in this CD into a real gem. He has as much fun producing and playing the music as people have listening. Of course, you can hardly pass a Tiesto set without feeling the groove and music, and this is no exception! This one and the live set Magik 7: Live in LA are worthy CDs if you have never seen Tiesto live and wanted to hear what its like."
1,book disappointment,The wrong book was sent to me--it was Rahab. I'm only interested in Priscilla and Aquila. It looks like it must be by the same author--but I'm not going to bother trying again.
2,"Good, maybe even great, but they raised the price","This nice little distributor cap (made in Italy)for the 1985 BMW 318i was initially offered at $2.51 and I ordered one. To Amazon's credit, they honored the price, but then, immediately afterward, the price jumped to $13.44; a 535% increase. Talk about inflation!It's still not a bad buy. Incidentally id does come complete with the RF shield. I just wish I had ordered 5 at the original price."
2,A Little Worn,This book was more worned than I expected but the price is still unbeatable and rare in it's kind. Timely delivery as well.
4,Goldilocks,"It is a twist on the original Goldilocks and the three bears. The gold beads on her little locks or braids were an ingenious way to make this book work for African Americans.The story line is a bit stronger than what I remember the original to be, yet not harsh. There is a good message in it. It deals with selfishness, laziness, ego, manipulation etc. Yet all in a way that children will easily understand.Well done! My 4 year old daughter loves it!"
2,"Don't be fooled by ""plus potassium.""","It has less than 2% of the recommended daily allowance. Sure, I should have checked, but it didn't even occur to me that something that *specifically* notes that it has potassium would have only a trace amount. Seems downright misleading."
5,Super cute espresso cups,I ordered this set for my mom for her birthday. She had been wanting some espresso cups and I thought she would love these. She does. She also serves panna cotta in them and it's wonderful.
2,"Packaged Improperly, Arrived Broken","These cups are very cute and stylish, but Macy's did not package them properly. The cups are exposed through cut-outs in the original box and Macy's did not put any additional padding around them in the shipping box. Nor did they put ""Fragile"" on the box. Cups arrived broken in a very beaten box. Very very disappointing."
1,disappointed,I received 2 cups with the same design on & was missing another one. The set in the picture looks very nice but mine was just a cheap mismatched version.
5,my favorite album,"simply beautiful singing with a direct and personal style, no hype , no gimmicks. At first all i wanted to hear was ""Fields of Gold"" again and again. But after listening through the rest, i have to say they all are gems. ""Autumn Leaves"" is another favorite. It's amazing that the album is gold with no radio play that i know of, no huge investment in publicity, etc., just word of mouth and a spot here and there in the papers and tv."
5,Song Bird & Live at Blues Alley,"Wow is all I can say and I don't even like to listen to music! All I've listened to for years is ""talk radio"" and then I watch ""news"" shows at night... that's it. I watched ABC's ""Night Line"" several months ago and they did a story on Eva. Before I could find the remote, to change channels, they started playing a little of her music. I was stunned and completely mesmerized by her voice and found myself sitting on the edge of the bed desperately trying to soak it all in. I went out and bought 3 of her CD's the next day, which is really saying something for me... prior to this I had not purchased any music in over 10 years! Absolutely amazing stuff!!"
4,Eva Cassidy Is A Shining Star,"Kudos to Eva's family and friends to have the foresight to share her precious gift with those of us who (unfortunately) never had the pleasure to hear her live. Her music is a treasure for the ages. I can only imagine the delight of people stumbling into a live performance while out on the town in D.C. expecting just another ""wanabe jazz singer"" then to be completely blown away by such a powerful, dynamic voice. I would (in hind sight) loved to have been one of those fortunate few!"
5,Hauntingly Compelling,"From the first notes of Fields of Gold to the Last notes of Over the Rainbow, I was compelled to pay attention to nothing else around me. I have been listening to incredible voices and music since the 1950s and I cannot remember being more affected by a performer. Eva Cassidy's interpretations of standards such as Autumn Leaves and Wade in the Water make them her own. There are not enough superlatives to adequately capture her unique sensitivity and musicianship and I will not try to. After hearing the entire Recording, I had to do it again. I remain hauntingly compelled. I cannot accept the fact that her voice has been forever silenced."
5,Magic,Words cannot describe the emotions I feel when I listen to Eva Cassidy sing. She is a true artist. Her voice is like the finest Irish crystal.
5,Make someone you love happy,"Eva Cassidy, while virtually unknown in the States, is considered one of the greatest singers of all time by many in the United Kingdom and Ireland. What do the Brits and Irish know that the Yanks don't? Find out for yourself. Call your favorite radio station and ask them to play something by Eva Cassidy. (If they don't have any to play, you need to find a better station!) Better yet, buy one of her CDs and play it for someone you love. Lights some candles, turn off the phone. You'll either be making love, hugging each other, or crying (or all three!) before the third song. Trust me."
5,A Voice from Heaven,"Love it, love it, love it. I can't wait to order all her CD's. So sorry she left us so early."
5,"An Angel Sings, Eva Cassidy, Songbird",I found this CD by accident in the UK.. I found a voice that brings out every emotion in every track.. She crosses every barrier... so much depth.. a must for all serious lovers of the female voice... and music..
5,What an Artist!!!!!,"This CD is a true gift to the world!!! My cousin suggested that I listen to Eva Cassidy and I am thrilled I did!! Her vocal ability was astounding and extremely versatile. She had a special style which blended folk, jazz, blues and gospel. Her interpretations of previously recorded songs was simply amazing. She sang these songs as if she wrote them herself!! The song entitled ""I Know You By Heart"" has a beautiful arrangement and is particularly moving because her brother accompanies her on the violin. This is a fabulous expression of true talent!!!"
5,A CD Worth Fields of Gold,"I watched Michelle Kwan skate to ""Fields of Gold"" after the Olympics. I watched her cry while she skated, as this song surely was picked to celebrate a gold medal. She did not win, but held her head high with dignity. The song haunted me, first because of the beautiful voice that sang it and second because of the meaning for the skater who skated to it. I heard someone say that it was Eva Cassidy's rendition of a Sting song. I had heard of Eva Cassidy and knew that she was no longer with us. I was not disappointed when I ordered this CD. The song and the voice are still hauntingly beautiful as are the songs ""Songbird"" and ""Over the Rainbow"". I only hope that she is still singing her songs wherever she may be now as her voice is the voice of an angel."
5,Amazing,"I had never heard of Eva until the 2002 Winter Olympics. Michelle Kwan skated to Sting's ""Fields of Gold"" with Eva singing the most beautiful rendition I have ever heard. She was truly a remarkable artist. I share the thoughts of another reviewer feeling happy and sad listening to Eva's beautiful voice. I love the entire cd. I am in awe of her and glad she left her legacy behind for us to treasure."
5,Songbird,I love this CD. I felt compelled to drop what I was doing and sit down and listen to the music. Eva's voice and arrangements are incredible.
4,Excelente voz y buena seleccion de temas,"Conocía solo la versión de Fields of Gold de Eva Cassidy, y por eso compré el cd. Pues me gusto mucho todo el cd. Muy buena la selección de temas, variados y excelente la versión de The falling Leaves, no es facil ""rehacer"" un viejo tema con mucho sabor francés, pues lo renueva por completo, es estupenda su versión."
4,"If you like Eva Cassidy, you'll like this CD","I have a few CD's from this artist. Someone suggested me this one, and I can say it falls within the style of Eva Cassidy herself, so it's a good one. Smooth, easy listening"
3,"Great Voice, but .............","I was disappointed after listening to this CD - not by her voice - which is really good - but by the selection of songs on the disc. If you're a jazz fan like I am, you probably won't like it. The music is mostly country, with one or two gospel songs thrown in [even they had a strong country ""flavor"" I thought]. The one song I really liked was Over the Rainbow.If you want to hear Eve sing jazz, try ""The Other Side"". That is a real jazz album and includes Over the Rainbow - the one song I really liked. A shame they didnt do a more balanced collection here - this album sounds much better than The Other Side - they must have re-mastered the sound and you can really hear the difference. I wish they would do that to all her old albums.If you like Eve's voice, you might want to try Devon Sinclair - whose voice is similar in the high registers, but who greater vocal range and expressiveness."
5,I can't put into the words...,"... how I feel about this album. Simply put, incredible! I've listened to this album so many times and feel like there are still a few thousand times worth of listening mileage left."
5,Fields of gold,"I was so moved by Michelle Kwan's performance to this song I had to buy this CD. I bought it for the song ""Fields of Gold"", which I listen to about 10 times a day in my car, but other songs are impressive as well. She has this voice no one else has and the ability to transform any piece into her own. This Cd will be a favorite to anybody."
5,Great Voice,"This has to be the best out of all the Eva CD's...I must admit that I bought all of her CD's after watching a special on ABC Nightline.The special was a moving tribute and yanked on mt heart strings.I think thats why I bought all of her CD's.Her story is a sad one but the music does get a little tiring after awhile.If you must have a an Eva CD,this is the 'first' one to get.The Sting tune ""Fields Of Gold"" is better than Sting himself.No joke."
4,"Songbird, by Eva Cassidy",Eva Cassidy has a haunting voice that has different arrangements to old songs that hits big for me! I recommend anything Eva has recorded.
5,An undiscovered great of our time,"I had never before heard of Eva Cassidy until she was brought to my attention on Amazon.com. It is so tragic that her life ended so early to melanoma(I also just lost my Dad to this monster). Her voice is clear and pitch so perfect.When reading the other reviews before buying her CDS, I just knew she had to be good(which is an understatement).Listening to her songs makes you want to listen again and again.Over The Rainbow can bring tears to your eyes, it is so moving.If she had lived I truly believe we would have seen her picking up a Grammy for this album.I am sure she is in heaven in Gods own personal choir."
2,Same songs repeated on CDs,"Be careful when you order these CDs. Basically, if you're new to this artist and luckily found her, buy Songbird and Wonderful World and you will have a nice collection or avoid these two and buy earlier CDs. An honest packaging would let you know to buy these two as a set.She has a really great voice."
5,eva cassidy was a treasure,While I have not yet heard Songbird I have had the great pleasure of hearing some of the cuts on Eva's CD Live at Blues Alley. Eva Cassidy's death to cancer robbed us of a musical treasure
4,One Of My All Time Favorite Female Singers,"This cd has outstanding vocals. I love the soulful ""Time Is A Healer"". This cd also includes my favorite version ever of ""Autumn Leaves"". But my favorites are the beautiful title song and ""Over The Rainbow"". I have several excellent versions of ""Over The Rainbow"". I have this song by Sandi Patty, Linda Eder, Monica Mancini, and Jane Monheit. They are all outstanding singers. But none of those versions are as hauntingly beautiful as Eva Cassidy's version."
4,amazing,"I thought this CD was amazing. Eva has an intense, haunting voice. Be sure to read her story on the inside cover. It is amazing that she worked on this CD only shorlty before she passed away so young from cancer. You can hear in the songs she sings that she was anticipating this, and looking toward heaven."
5,The real deal,"This CD has been on my wish list for several years. I kept forgetting to purchase it, then recently received it as a Christmas gift. Now I remember why I added it to my wish list so long ago. What a beautiful, true voice. It's so refreshing to hear a real singer with no auto-tune in sight. Just beautiful."
5,No American Idol winner will ever impress you again,"Not after you've heard this posthumous collection of remarkable interpretations. Others have said what I have to say, particularly about how Eva's Over the Rainbow touches some emotional chord inside you that maybe you didn't even know was there. In my whole life I can think of only a handful of other performances by anyone, in any genre, that are capable of producing a similar response in me. And on this one album, there are two such life-altering tracks (add Fields of Gold). I'm only sorry I didn't learn about her until, like many others, I saw a rebroadcast of Dave Marash's piece from Nightline."
4,"A voice strong , but stilled","Perhaps the fact that there will be no more recordings make this all the more powerful, but this is a remarkable CD. Eva's voice soars and is better than all the material. The arrangements and quality are not always top notch, but her talent shines through. Who knows if she would have gone on to be truly wonderful or over-hyped? We'll never know..."
5,Wow isn't strong enough!,"Wow! This is a knock your socks off voice! Forget that she's on the other side of life! Eva Cassidy has a voice for all time and eternity. Thanks to her parents Barbara and Hugh for giving us the opportunity of hearing her sing at the stake of having their loss. Like all the great singers that any generation loses I'm glad Chris Biondo had the equipment to record all that we have the fortune to buy. And buy we should! Pick your favorite and wipe the tears away with a big rag! For this is a voice that covered lead, harmony, vocal and guitar unlike any other. Yea Eva you knew what you were handling girl! You did a great job!"
5,I wish there were more than 5 stars to give here...,"I bought this cd after hearing 'snippets' of it somewhere (can't remember where!). Her range, in both octaves and in interpretation, are unmatched. I have been listening to her nonstop since I got this cd and I still cannot get enough. Having sung with both professionals and amateurs gives me a good perspective on Eva's abilities, and I would give my left arm to be able to sing with as much emotion, range, power, and control as she does. Amazing! I highly recommend this cd."
4,Songbird - Eva Cassidy,"This studio album is more polished than ""Live at Blues Alley"" but the instrumentals sometimes overpower her voice at innapropriate times.There are only ten songs on this album as opposed to twenty on ""Live at Blues Alley"".Still, it is an excellent addition to anyone's library of her work!"
3,be careful!,"I love music. Trust me. But please be aware that just because there is a band wagon, you should not always jump on it!. Eva does have a beautiful voice, there is no doubt about it. However, so many albums with so many covers of other other artist' music or covers of traditional tunes wears very thin. She does two covers here that are good: Fields of Gold and Songbird. But the rest of the albums is just o.k. It is an album that you might hear in the background at a book store or at a frinds house and ask who it is, but the point is that it is good background music at best. I believe that alot of the hype is that the singer has passed away and that she did not get her ""shot"". IF you are a music enthusiast, search on. If you own a a business and are looking for something in the background that is pleasant and nice, it is a good choice."
3,Should Listen to Before Buying,"I bought this CD after reading a good review of it in People magazine. I wish I would have listened to it before I bought it. I think reviewers let the story of her death at a young age influence their oppinion of the CD. There are beautiful songs on the CD and Eva's voice is quite good as well, but her covers of most of the songs lack the emotional depth of the song's originators. It's a decent CD, but not one that I would keep at the top of my play list."
5,What a treasure!!!,"Her voice surrounds you, caresses your spirit, resonates within you, and touches your soul. A new voice in my pantheon of great artists."
5,"""Fields of Gold""","Eva's ""Fields of Gold"" is the most beautiful song I have ever heard in my life and I'll always consider it a personal gift from this wonderful singer I never knew."
1,disappointed listener,"For a much praised CD I was sad to discover a woman with a thin voice who attempted to sing beyond her abilities. She would have benefitted from staying within her limited skills and singing in a simpler fashion. She doesn't have volume or control and, I think, lacks interpretive skill. She tries to sing many styles and masters none. I will stick with Sting for Fields of Gold, thank you; Paula Cole, Cassandra Wilson or (staying local) Rebecca Parrish; there is far more soul in Aretha or Ray or the Commitments!!! I found Eva's renditions to drag annoyingly, and her attempts at emotion far too whiny. It is a sorrow to lose anyone at a young age. That doesn't turn her into a great singer."
1,One good song - forget the rest,"I bought the CD because I love ""Fields of Gold"" and thought that the rest of the songs would be of similar caliber. Wrong. I just did not like the rest of the songs. It strikes me as an album that has one good song and the rest is ""filler"". Try it out before you buy - maybe the other songs will suit your taste."
5,What a voice,"I learned about Eva Cassidy from a friend. He said that if I didn't like this CD, he would buy it. He didn't have to buy the cd. It is excellent. Eva's voice is given a chance to show itself on many of the songs. It's too bad that her life was so short, but I am thankful that she made these recordings. The CD has a jazz flavor, and Eva's voice shines throughout the cd."
5,Best compilation EVER!,Eva Cassidy was an amazing artist. This is one of my favorite albums that I go back to again and again.
3,Eva Cassidy,"Eva Cassidy had a beautiful, clear voice and sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow like I never heard it before! Some songs were unfamiliar to me. A good cd for easy listening."
5,Simply some of the best singing I've ever heard,"""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" on this album is a wonderful jazz vehicle anyway, but Eva's version is SO GOOD, you will be blown away. I promise.Eva Cassidy was able to do jazz, contemporary pop and gospel with equal and outstanding talent. We heard her CD in a music store, stopped in our tracks and immediately bought every one of her CD albums we could find.A voice like Eva Cassidy's only comes along once a generation. (Think Mario Lanza, Karen Carpenter) And she is no longer with us, sadly. Her few CD's are real treasures."
2,Lounge singer?,"I bought the album expecting something original and heart-rendering, but I found the album less than exciting, I must say. The person who recommended it to me did so after I had purchased Shelby Lynne's album and Lucinda Williams' _Essence_ album (which I love, as I loved _Car Wheels on a Gravel Road_). I have yet to understand why he thought I would like Eva's album(s). There are no similarities at all. Both Shelby Lynne and Lucinda Williams write their own music and both have much more of a ""down and dirty"" style. Eva's album is ""nice"" and would easily fit into the easy-listening category. There's just something lacking in it--perhaps the reason is that the album is a ""greatest hits,"" culled from other albums. I've listened to it several times, and I just can't get excited by it. I'm very sorry I bought it without listening to it first; I would recommend that folks listen to the tracks of any album before buying it, even if the recommendations are unusually positive about the album."
3,Dissapointing,"Eva Cassidy certainly had a magnificent voice, but in many instances here she is hobbled by poor arrangements. I was most interested in her folk interpretations and can't recommend them at all. The Hammond on ""Golden Thread"" overpowers the song. Compare Cassidy to Clarence Ashley on ""Wayfaring Stranger"" and the limits of her emotional interpretation become very obvious. There are some fine efforts here such as ""I Know You by Heart"" but overall it's overhyped."
2,Great voice but....,"absolutely plodding song selections and arrangements. What a waste of a great voice. I really wanted to like this album, but it's just not a pleasant album to listen to. Even my daughter, who adores ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"", was bored to tears. She asked me why the singer was singing so slowly. Unfortunately, I couldn't give her a good answer. Same for ""Fields of Gold"". What could have been a wonderful rendition of a great song turns into something to listen to while you're getting a root canal. It's so unfortunate, but it's not the artist's fault. It is the producers who botched this album so badly."
5,Natural Beauty,"After reading about Eva Cassidy in a Washington Post article and some of the wonderful reviews here, I decided to just go ahead and buy most of her original albums. While her music covers a range of styles, I prefer the simpler melodies with a quiet strength. Like some other people, I had to cry when I heard her sing ""Fields of Gold"". I wondered last night, how could I describe this beautiful voice? I decided it flows like a river, with a natural beauty that is both immediate and timeless. I also felt that the eventual success of her talent says a lot for her listeners. When I looked at the credits for ""Live at Blues Alley"" this morning, I wasn't surprised that she thanked ""the creative spirit that flows through everyone"" along with her family and friends. Imagine how she would have sung some other great songs."
5,Eva Cassidy Songbird,"If I could give this CD 10 stars, instead of just five, I would. I think it is the best compilation of Eva's songs out there, although Live at Blues Alley is also great. Her version of ""Over the Rainbow"" is extraordinary in its beauty. The longing of the lyrics is brought out by the deep emotional connection Eva makes to the song. Such a shame she lived such a short life and that recognition only came after she passed away. She is on a different plane altogether from Today's Hot Thing."
5,eva's songbird,"Early last year, I happened to watch NIGHTLINE which I had not seen in a long time. The show was about Eva Cassidy whom I had not heard of prior to that night. It had been a long time since I had been moved by any music and I simply thought that those days were over. I was absolutly, totally blown away. I heard the most beautiful voice and the next day tried to buy SONGBIRD. It was sold out everywhere. I ordered it and continue to be touched in the deep places in my heart by the beauty of Eva's voice. IT is golden!"
4,Fields of Gold,Eva Cassidy's CD on Fields of Gold is excellent. She is marvellous in her voice quality and pitch. I enjoyed the CD very much.
4,Happy-Bluebird Cassidy Takes Ownership of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow',"If Eva Cassidy were to play Dorothy in a modern day Wizard of Oz, I say she would have received even greater reviews than Judy Garland on ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" Ive listened to many renditions of this hit, but never before has it been sung with so much personal meaning. If you had never heard it before, you would think she wrote it. It was almost as if while singing this song during her little-recognized career, she knew her life would soon fall short but would be taken ""somewhere way up very high."" And she indeed has.To other fans out there who are Sirius-XM Radio Listeners, please continue to provide feedback and requests to the Siriusly Sinatra Channel at SIRIUSLYSINATRA@SIRIUSXM.COM and other Satellite Channels which have begun to play her music recently.Eva Cassidy, you are now flying far above even the ""Happy Little Bluebirds."" Thank you and God Bless you always."
4,Poignant and haunting,"Because music is so personal, I hesitate to write a review of this one. And I hesitate yet again because Cassidy's premature death has focused a spotlight on her, a spotlight that could distort the true worth of her songs. But her voice is so full of yearning, passion and a certain haunting grace that I can't help but recommend this work. Listen to Somewhere Over the Rainbow, for instance. Her version didn't grab me at first, not until a little more than halfway through, when she began to build in strength and fervor and then...well, I was hooked. Don't compare her to Judy Garland but take her on her own. She isn't a singer to be categorized into one genre but takes various types of music (traditional, gospel, folk) and makes them her own. To all accounts, Cassidy was wary of the limelight, somewhat shy and definitely stubborn...and long overdue in getting some attention."
5,Eva Cassidy Song Bird,"One of the best CD's ever recorded. I placed the song ""Song Bird"" on my wife Annie's on-line memorial, at [...]. The CD is like a breath of fresh air, but in particular the title song, ""Song Bird,""is a grief buster. It will help you more with your loss than you could ever imagine. Truly beautiful!"
2,"Beautiful voice, poor accompaniment","I bought this CD because I was told that Eva Cassidy's voice was truly wonderful. It is a beautiful voice, but the accompaniment definitely sounds like it was done on the cheapest electronic keyboard (one that can do all instruments in poor representation.) The background music is best summed up as ""UCK."" And this is sad, because the voice is truly lovely. But after a couple of listenings, I probably won't listen to it again. It's cheap and nasty. I also clearly hear the echo put onto the voice to make it sound fuller, which can't possibly be necessary."
2,Beautiful voice - getting a CD that skips NEW - not so much,"My mother and I are huge Eva Cassidy fans and I was so excited to get her this CD for Christmas. We opened it a few days later and loved everything about it - until it got to Somewhere Over the Rainbow and it SKIPPED!! Brand new CD! I have never had that happen to any CD I have ever bought except this one which I ordered directly from Amazon - not a 3rd party seller. I am very disappointed. Unfortunately, I did not keep the return sticker because I knew we would love it and not need to return it. So my mother is stuck with a CD that gets to her favorite song and skips repeatedly. Shame on AMAZON!"
2,standard stuff,"honestly, I didn't like this album too much. I bought it because everyone raved about it. But it was somewhat banal covers of standard jazz and soft rock songs. And I got really tired of the Hammond organ and airy, overproduced sounds. If you're looking for Ella and or Billie, pass this one by."
5,Awesome Book.,"This is a Good Book ON Corvette, And Corvette Ads. Nicely laid out.This book however has A lot more than 11 pages as described on Amazon,and it a good book,updated up until the time it was published with the then latest cars,I recommend this book along with Terry Jackson's Corvette Catalogues,1991,The Apple Press,128Pages,A Quintet book.Hopefully someone would do a similar book that showcases even more and All the Corvette Ads,memorablia."
3,Works Great but...,I bought this to do some labeling to organize my movie collection. While the labeler seemed cheap to me it was later when I looked for the printer tapes. The ones on this printer cost more then the labeler itself. Had I known I wouldn't have bought it. So for those that are looking for a labeler take a look at the price for the tape too.
4,one of the best ufo compilations to date,"Phill Moggs unmistakable voice combined with Micheal Schenker awsome guitar playing makes this album an essential to own for anyone who listens to hard rock/heavy metal.The guitar riffs in the songs Lights out,Let It Roll,Only You Can Rock Me,have a raw sound that sounds like something from a bar band.This album is a must for anyone who plays guitar!"
4,Essential UF0? Maybe,This recording is really great for a first listener. I have been a fan of UFO since I was introdueced to them with Strangers in the Night(LIVE). I say there's more to UFO than to what is on this recording.
2,Annotations Unnecessary,"I rated this specifically on the annotations, since the novel itself is widely available without them.I liked the overall package - it's a truly beautiful book with many illustrations and pictures showing the way that Uncle Tom has been understood and portrayed in the United States since it's initial publication.On the other hand, I found the annotations to be irritatingly most unhelpful. There were a handful of comments that truly brought insight, but most seemed to be commentary on style (see other reviews for examples), or definitions for obscure words, some of which I found to be, if not inaccurate, not really providing the nuances of the term. More often than not, I found the annotations to be irritating and to detract from my enjoyment of the novel. I had hoped that Skip Gates would share the depth of his academic and intellectual talents, but found a rather cursory approach was used instead."
3,A very heavy book,"Never having read UNCLE TOM'S CABIN or GONE WITH THE WIND, I thought I should do so while I'm still upright and checked out both at the local library along with J. G. Ballard's complete short stories. Together these three made a terrifically heavy bag to drag to my car. (I am no longer a young woman.)I enjoy having notes on the pages to which they refer, especially when they are substantive, as those in UTC are. They make a nice break in the reading of a long and sometimes tedious text. Maybe someday someone will write the annotated GONE WITH THE WIND. There are surely many references in GWTW that must be lost on readers of today.No one would argue that either of these books is a great work of literature, but each has its interest and, for the most part, keeps the reader turning the pages, if only to learn why so many people have read them over the years."
3,Read the Story - Avoid the Notes,"I side with the earlier reviewers who found many of the annotations immaterial at best, distracting and offensive at worst. The novel has stood the test of time and needs no further accolades. It remains a classic and the uneven editors notes cannot detract from it. I heartily edorse an earlier recommendation...if you have not read ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", read the novel on its own. Then if you want some nit-picking and innane comments on the story come back to this edition."
4,"After all these years, they're still Vocally the best group!","Waiting patiently for 4 yrs, after Masterpiece Theatre, I was surprised to see where their music would lead them. I was not dissapointed, as a fan of their musical style, I love how they do not conform to what is out there. Granted they do not have the backing of a big multi million record company since theyre on their own at 33rd Records.On to the album, vintage EN VOGUE is showcased on Losin My Mind. Listen carefully to their harmonizing and background vocals, truly amazing. Best tracks that focus on vocals are: Million Different Ways, Heaven, I do Love You( Piece of My Luv).The rest of the songs are great 2 bump in da car n listen over and over again, but they did stay away from the harmonizing for which they are internationally known for. That is the only draw back if your a die-hard fan. Even so it's great to have them back and hopefully here for a long time!!Karl Sean"
3,Mellow,"Well, I love Envogue, but was not truly inspired that the group still has that fire like they used to by this joint. The opening track had me me saying okay but it sort of went down hill from that point. I still think they need that fourth vocalist, it was what made their presence so poignant, and forceful. But, I am still a supporter. I mean what true supporter of R&B could ever forget ""You never gonna get it"". Much love EV3."
4,Soulful Return,"When I heard that EV were returning without Maxine and with a new member--Rhona Bennett--of MMC Fame along with Britney, Justin, Christina, JC, bla blah--I was a bit skeptical but I am so amazed by this cd, they really have returned to the soulful feel that all music should have.They truly possess something that most groups/singers wish that they would have right now.Highlights on this album include:Losin My MindOoh Boy--first singleDissed HimCarefulNew Day CallinDefinitely pick this EV cd up!!!!"
3,Soulflower - a rare and lovely bloom,"I was just thinking the other day that I wished En Vogue would release a new CD and I happened to come across Soulflower. As expected it is better than anything else out there from R&B and hip-hop girl groups. This time the music is more spare, with more live instrumentation. Only two of the original members remain but the new girl blends well with them. The harmonies are masterful (also as expected) and there are some excellent melodies. Lyrically the album could be better but that is a complaint that I have had of all of them. Many of the phrases are cliche and some awkward. The first six songs and the last four are outstanding, well-crafted musically and vocally. Songs near the middle are less impressive. There is the usual refreshingly eclectic mix of styles with the voices and amazing old-style harmonies to keep it all familiar and centred."
2,Highly Anticipated Sorely Disappointed,"Like those listed below i was overjoyed to know that EnVogue was coming once again to grace us with their stellar heavenly vocals, amid rumors that the original 4some were possibly gonna get back together before this album was cut (yet the other 2 members that are absent from this album wanted to use outside producers...so with that conflict the 2 remaining members opted to add a new girl and put out this sorely disappoint of an album). With the lead single sounding more like redundant filler with the monotonus hook ""ooh boy"" i expected more from the remaining funky divas. I was not impressed in the least by this album...which sounded more like a demo, for now i'll opt to listen to divas previous works rather than to this upsetting body of work."
4,"EN Vogue still reign ""Supreme""","I have been a fan of Envogue's since their first Album Born to Sing. I have watched the line up change and stuck with them through it all. When i heard they had a new album out I immediately ran out to buy it without hearing any singles. I am pleased i did. This is one of their best records, its up there with ""Born to Sing"", and ""Funky Diva's""The stand out songs are:All You SeeOoh BoyEverydayLosin My MindStopThey even did a remake of the old school ""Guy"" jam, Piece of my love. Its not as good as the original but its good. The new singer is a fantastic addition. Her voice blends very well with Terry's and Cindy's. If you were ever a fan, get this CD you wont be disappointed."
3,same same,It is a pity that the ladies of En Vogue did so much work for an album with tracks which sounds the same same same...
5,They're back...,"What a fantastic record!! It's so good to see the girls back with a new singer. My favorites are ""Losin my mind"" with has one of the bounciest, most clever hooks i've heard in years, and ""dissed him"" which is a killer old school slow jam. A MUST have for anybody who thought there wasn't life before Beyonce'."
5,Thank you!,"First listen... hmmm... wasn't quite sure. That has changed dramatically. For me there are 12 great tracks out of 15 which is much better than the average nowadays. (Beyonces album 2 out of 15 in my opinion)Vocally this group is still untouched. I know.. there are unfortunately just two original members. Doesn't change the fact that they sing particularly well. Great harmonies, super sexy voices. New girl Rhona, my opinion, weakest voice... but its far from being weak!Best tracks for me: All you see. Please release this with a sexy video. You would be back on top. Track ""heaven' is supersweet. 'Ooh boy' is funky and uplifting, 'A million different ways"" sounds dramatic (chorus), 'Piece of my heart' is amazing. Follows 'giving him something he can feel' Its superb and I swear I hear all original members... :-)If you like soul and R&B; its right for you... really right for you. I just hope there will be another album to follow this.Again... thank you"
3,A disappointment,"When I heard En Vogue had a new CD out....I ran to the store. I thought this one would knock my socks off. My socks are still on! I love En Vogue, but, I found the voices bland (I KNOW those girls CAN sing!), the songs mediocre/boring. Hmmm. Something is missing here. Maybe Maxine and Dawn? I've listened to the CD about4 times now and after the first 3 songs, I keep wanting to hit the ""next"" button! It's like ALOT of filler material. I'm glad they're back and hope they do well. Only wish the CD was more interesting."
1,Sorry EV !!,"Have been a fan from day one and have all your CDs, but Soulflower has no soul. Tried to listen to it 4 times since I bought it, only to skip through it each time. Maybe a few more club dates, talk shows, studio time and you'll bring the funk and soul; until then I'm playing Funky Divas !!!! Keep on Pushin'"
1,It's like 'Finding Nemo' on both sides!,"I'm not a big fan of transformers Cybertron and this toy is a prime example of why. First off, I have to make him lean at an angle in order to stand. It looks like he's trying to limbo. Secondly, he's got these teeny tiny little forearms. I call them his lucky fins like in 'Finding Nemo'. Third, his transformation is a little difficult to keep together. His little forearms don't like to stay in place. Just not that great a toy. Only recommended for completists."
2,Cool but complex.,"You need a PHD in physics to put this thing back together. Believe me I've tried, my 5 year old doesn't stand a chance. It's small and complicated. I'd pass on this one."
3,"Make my day, old man","This is great and all, but his real name is Brakedown, OK? So Amazon, if you get his name to Scout f96, you will be sorry. Thank you."
3,SHOP STOOL ADT-81056,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A GOOD STURDY SHOP STOOL FOR MY WORK BENCH AT HOME ,AND CAME ACROSS THIS MODEL ADT-81056 SHOP STOOL. I DID HAVE A WOODEN STOOL WHICH I HAD FOR MANY YEARS ,AND HAD TO KEEP GLUING . THIS STOOL IS ONE THAT YOU CAN SIT AT ,AND ROTATE YOURSELF FOR ANY CAUSE YOU MAY HAVE. THERE IS ONE FAULT I HAVE WITH THE STOOL,IT IS TO HIGH. I DID TRIM THE LEGS SO IT WOULD NOT BE TO HIGH,BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A GOOD HANDY MAN ,AND DO SHOP WORK. I AM AT MY BENCH WITH A STURDY STOOL ,NOT TO HIGH AND ENJOYINGING IT. CAMB,MA. A.A.DAVIS"
4,"Too high for me, but a good stool","The seat height is 29"", which is too high for my 34"" work bench. But it's a sold stool. I did swap out some of the fastners with longer screws, added some washers, used lock nuts, etc. to make the stool more secure. The seat rests on two of the legs, I was worried that it might wobble but it's hasn't. The seat spins, which I didn't really want. It takes a bit of effort to spin it, so it's not uncontrollable."
5,stool,"My husband love it I bought it for his birthday, I would recommend highly! It even swivels which he loves."
4,"Good quality, could use better instructions","Easy to install, holds firm on the projector. Instructions could use some improvement as it's not entirely clear which mount systems it's compatible with."
1,NO,"Got it, Started to watch it, made it litterally 30 minutes into the movie, and I could tell it was horrible, not a smart purchase, but SHIPPED FAST!!!!"
1,very disappointed..,"I live in the South, and I think it would be better if actors just stopped trying to imitate the ""accents"".The story line was boring, we watched the whole thing hoping it would it better, but I would suggest passing on this one."
3,Mostly for die hard fans,"Stephen King's novel ""Desperation"" won't let any old fans down. The beginning is pure and clean horror which is Mr King's trademark (there's not a doubt in this world that the enormous cop is the evil himself). The violence is gory and not an easy thing to handle for ""weak"" ones but things get out of hands halfway through the novel. I didn't like the religious tones that you can read between the lines. Everything gets too obviuos when the end is near and the result is that you get a little bit disapponited but you WILL continue...Finally I would like to say to all the people who haven't read anything by Stephen King (probably a very small crowd): If you are about to read something by Mr King, start with ""The Shining"", ""The Stand"", ""It"" or ""Cujo""."
4,Definetly a great book,"I've have read this book twice, and I enjoyed it more the second time.It has some of the best imagery of any of his books. I think Tak is a brilliant creation. I can't stand it when people criticize his recent writing. I think all of his books are ingenious. Most of the people who talk S**T about his books speak from positions of ignorance. I admit that not all of his novels are created equal, but they are all good."
3,King's work keeps you reading-but is so predictable!!!,"This is one of Stephen King's better novels. I did enjoy it, but sorry to say-I don't like much of Stephen King's work anymore. It's predicatable, and with this book he dragged you along, it took him 3 pages to explain one thing. He's making me feal like an idiot!"
3,Disappointing,"I have been a long-time King fan, but Desperation is incredibly disappointing. The end was an absolute joke. I couldn't wait to get this book over with."
3,"Entertaining, but where's the payoff?","Desperation maintained my interest and kept me flipping ahead trying to find out what happened . But by the end I found myself saying, ""That's it? That's the end?"" For sheer pleasure, Desperation is a good, fast read and worth your time. But it does have flaws: not enough character development, a fizzled ending, and it was a little too much like The Stand (my favorite novel of all time). Call it ""The Stand Light"". I hate to call it a hack job, because I do like King, but a good read nonetheless."
4,"Not his best, but very good","This book was gripping and given the length, anyone can read it in a short period of time. it pulls you in and won't let go! I recommend it."
5,It doesn't get any better than this,"I read this book last June, and I am still afraid to be home alone. No one has ever spooked me the way Collie Entragian did! What an awsome job Mr. King has once again done in literally scaring the living daylights out of me. Because of this book my husband can no longer leave the house at night without me. Please read this book."
4,Horror..... You've got to love it.,"Desperation and The Regulators were given to me as a christmas present a few years ago. I've re-read them both since then. Desperation is one of the darkest books I can ever remember reading, and I have read a lot of horror storys. Not for everyone, but definatley for me. Read it and love it."
4,King at his (Christian) Best,"I have always wanted to say, when asked what type of Christian I was, that I was similar to that of Stephen King and the Indigo Girs. King constantly engages with Christianity in ways that realistically explore our faith and times. He does not ""sugar-coat"" the fact that we as Christians live amid unreconcilables. Desperation, like The Stand before it, explores what faith truly means. King is dealing in Desperation with the question of how we can reconcile a God who loves us and yet allows us to suffer, many times without giving us clear reasons as to why. This strikes me as significant and important in ways that didactically ""Christian"" novels (such as, most notably, Frank Peretti) never get to the heart of in any way nearly as truly or richly as King."
3,"Long novel, needed substantial editing/condensing","This book took forever and a half to read.Did anyone notice Stephen King's factual error on the Chinese brothers' names? They were supposed to beLushan, Ch'anandLushan, ShihKing probably discovered the name An Lushan, who was a Tujue general and an emperor for a brief Dynasty in China, Yan. But his family name was ""An"", and given name is ""Lushan"", instead of the other way round. It is an error common for people not familiar with Chinese naming schemes. There is no one with the surname ""Lushan"" in China.Just surprised this wasn't fact-checked or edited out by the time it made it to print."
2,good ideas but lots of plot wandering,A typical Stephen King book. A bit different from the movie. He wanders around in the plot a lot and gets lost sometimes in side stories (verbal diahrrea). If you can scan past the excess there is a good book in here somewhere.
2,A great premise turns out to be a letdown,"This book had a great premise, but it ended up letting me down. First off, it took King nearly 700 pages (in hardcover) to tell this story when he could have done it in 300. There's literally 30 pages of back story for every character. Overblown, in my opinion. This could have been a much stronger read if cut in half.Overall, I have mixed feelings about this book. There are some great moments here that are a pleasure to read, but there are too many where I was left tempted to skip pages and a few times I did (which I hate to do) and didn't feel like I missed anything. The whole God thing got tiring after awhile and the end left me scratching my head.I'm torn between giving this 2 or 3 stars. I've given other King books 3 stars, but I've also enjoyed them a lot more than I did this one, and I felt this could have been a lot better, so I guess I'll have to settle on 2."
3,"HUGE book, but worth the time","This book was sitting on my shelf for years before I decided to tackle it. While I'm not one to shy away from a long book...this one, especially in hard cover, is a BIG book! Either way, it took me a bit of time to get through, but it was worth it. Having bought it on clearance, I felt the story could even stand up with some of King's most famous works.Overall I enjoyed the plot, I felt it was well thought out and written. I also enjoyed the characters, finding them interesting and diverse. With the ending, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleased with how it all worked out. Not quite predictable.I would definitely recommend this book to King fans. It's probably one of his most unsuspecting books. And now...it's time to see if it's sister book The Regulators, matches up!"
3,Middle Of the Road King!,"I am an avid fan of King's good and bad books. This epic was strong in spirit and weak in finish. The premise is based upon a mythical god of evil that is entoumbed in an evil mountain. More time should have been spent on definition of the god ""Tak"" and less on his gruesome exploits and carnage. King needs to provide more explosive endings and not leave you trailing in the wind.The cosmis fight between good and evil is always tempered in King's novels with less than perfect real life human beings. But many of his best works incude the less than ordinary and more than normal.This book deals with a tragic hero and an unworthy hero. There is no closure to the tale and as in the past, king leaves the tale open for next generation stories.I like to use of King's past bit players in all of his books. The easter egg's are easy to spot for King fans in this book.It sums up to a long drawn out tradgedy and only woth the wait for real diehard fans. Wait for paperback"
3,"He thinks it's one of his best, I say it's so-so.","Not that bad of a book, I find the tie in of The Regulators a much better read"
2,Very disappointing,"I am a big Stephen King fan. I really admire his ability to create real characters and how he gets inside their heads. He really does have a gift, which is evident in tales such as The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, The Body, etc.Unfortunately, Desperation reads like it was written by somebody attempting to ape King's style, and missed all of the depth. This is a very superficial and messy story. I did not care about these characters, they did not seem real. That's rare for King.I have read his brilliant book 'On Writing' - the sad thing is that he breaks many of his own rules in Desperation. It reads like a second draft - with still many unnecessary sentences, smelly adverbs, etc still in it. In fact, it reminded me of the story in 'On Writing' that he provides as an example of an unedited work.I guess that if you merely want a fast-paced horror tale with a lot of action, then there's a lot for you to like here. But that's not why I read King."
2,One of his Worst,"I am a huge Stephen King fan. I usually buy his new books the first day they're out and read them within a few days. If I were to rank his work, I would put this novel somewhere near the bottom. I have also never understood its strange relationship with The Regulators, in which many of the same people who lived and died in Desperation are unaccountably present for a nightmarish confrontation with a bunch of cartoon characters. Huh?But I digress. Desperation is one of several glaring examples of Steve's inability to find an editor who can be honest with this huge genius. He has rolled these characters out from his giant basement of stereotypes, with the plot jolting along from one head-scratching sequence to another. This was the book that almost made me lose faith in Stevie, and that's really saying a lot. Avoid at all costs. Jump ahead to the more mature, thoughtful, altogether inspired Steve of Bag of Bones, Lisey's Story and Duma Key."
1,I will never buy a Stephen King novel again,"I enjoyed ""IT"" very much, but I feel disrespected when a writer turns on the ""book writing machine"". The book is not even worth ist weight in paper."
2,Not very good,I've read a few of SK's books and I've liked most of them. This one I didn't like too much. It was way too long considering what happened in it. The characters were not interesting enough and I kept mixing them up. As one of the reviewers mentioned; how can the good guys loose when you know that god is on their side? The end was a let-down and where was the suspense?Enough said.
1,"Comical, un-King, and overall desperatingly mind numbing...","This book was rather comical at parts...Whenever someone would yell ""Tak!"" it was rather funny...but it got old too soon. This book was not horror however, for it didn't incite even the most minute amount of fear into you, unless you happen to be a ten year old. I could not even finish this book, as it was not aimed at mature level readers. King intwined a tres numb Judeo-Christian value into the novel which absolutely degraded the level of the book. This book was not King's forte and should best be left alone."
2,"Weak writing, not scary at all...","Above all, the book is poorly written. The plot is formulaic and forgettable. The author's attempt to be suspenseful and scary fell flat. I'm not a Stephen King reader but I was sorely disappointed by this book."
2,Poor showing for King in Desperation,"Definately not his best work. If your a fan of Stephen King you may enjoy his very untraditional charcters in this book. Definately a change (but not a positive one) for Stephen King. If you've never read King don't pick this book, instead try ""The Stand."" Desperation read as a desperate attempt by King to simply complete a new book."
4,Good read,"This was a good story, however....not the page turner as was Cujo or Needful Things. I enjoy more suspense and a ""surprise"" ending."
4,i read it while driving thru NEVADA...creepy...,"i thought this book was pretty good. it was, at least, about a million times better than it's partner, 'the regulators'. and the few boring parts (for instance, johnny marinville's little daydreams about his life) are easily outweighed by the really great ones. the book gets a bit slow near the end but for the most part was chilling! i should add that it takes place in nevada, which i was going thru at the time i read it. probably added to the realism, if anything!"
3,gory hard to follow tale,"So far I've read 5 sk novels and this is my least favorite. It has gory details and parts that make you shiver(from the gore) but thats about it. That cop gave me the creeps at first but then it wore off fast! There were to many things to remember, like con tas,can taks,can cans, & can tamatoes. good details but it dosen't make this one a top contender with other ones i've read"
4,Desperation,"This book is thrilling! I am a Floridian, 13 years old. I was awake past midnight, not concerned about the test the next day at school. I was to in depth of Taks evil plans and plots! THIS IS A MUST READ!!!"
4,WOW!!! I couldn't put it down!,"I am not an avid reader...but, I couldn't seem to put this book down. The book is 690 pages...the longest that I have ever read, and I read it in six days...that is a world record for me. Well worth the money!"
3,Doesn't give King's reputation accurate justice,"For the average author, this book could be the pinnacle of their career. It shows deep character depth, a highly developed imagination and just enough realism to lend it credibility.However, this work does not live up to the potential the author has shown in works such as Dolores Claiborne, Cujo, and Pet Semetary. King does not give us a chance to become personally acquainted with the characters before horror befalls them. We, the loyal readers, do not care enough about the poor victims to quickly turn the pages, crying out ""No, don't go in there, don't do that!"".Sorry Mr. King, perhaps your next story could include the death of a book critic."
4,"Slow start, but great finish!","I read the first 50 pages, then it sat on the shelf for a month or more. I picked it back up (out of boredom) and discovered that shortly thereafter it was difficult to put down! This book is like an onion - the plot peels off in layers as you go through it. If you find yourself having a hard time with Desperation, stick with it - the end is worth the effort!!"
1,WEAK! I love Stephen King but enough of these whiners..TAK!,"After reading the jacket and sizing up the cool cover for King's latest book, I thought I was in for a real treat. Unfortunately, what began with a bang later developed then died with a whimper. King was grasping at straws and trying to incorporate far too much of the ""God is Cruel"" garbage into young David Carver's character. How I yearn for a return to a book like ""The Shining,"" ""The Stand,"" even ""IT"" far surpassed this piece of garbage. No wonder my friends have stopped reading this stuff, with all the genuine horror in the world, why does King involve us with evil fake insects and animals possessed by lesser demons? Please tell me ""The Regulators"" is an improvement"
5,Good Stephen King,Read this back to back with The Regulators to see the difference in King's personality split. Same topic very different treatment. Would recommend.
5,Desperation,Stephen King should be best author of the year. He has a wild imagination. I enjoy reading his novels because he is very detailed with his writing. Its like a mini movie screen in your brain while you are reading. This book is very interesting and confusing at times but you need to know whats going on. This novel switches scenes and writes about dreams people have. I would recommend this novel to people who have strong stomachs because it will blow you away. People with a great imagination should definitely read this novel.
4,Very visual...very King,"Desperation is no Stand, but not many works are. With that said, I liked this book. King gets too wordy, but he has been doing that for about 15 years, so I kind of expect it anymore. What he does well, however, is develop scenes that stick in your mind, and characters that you really feel you know.Some of the stuff in Desperation is truly creepy, and he throws in the kind of gore that makes your skin crawl. The first hundred pages or so legitimately freaked me out, and I was hooked from there. The plot doesn't have that 'epic' feel a book this long should, but I still don't think you will feel let down by the end...worth reading if you like this kind of stuff."
1,This book is too long,"I got so confused reading this book I had to go to the Encylopedia to figure out what was going on.It was a chore reading the entire book and tgook three days, I picked up a copy used at the library for a dollar. It was way overpriced IMHO"
1,Desperation is a Dud!,"This book starts out interesting enough, but then gets bogged down in hundreds of pages with very little happening. Near the middle it becomes very predictable and boring. Remove the meaningless ramblings and the book would be half the length. No more boring Stephen King for me. This book is more dull than ""The Stand"" if that is even possible."
2,Disappointed reader,"This was my first book by S.King. It was also my last.Lots of snakes, rats, blood.Sorry Stephen, you sell millions of copies but you bored me."
3,Vivid imagery but annoyingly political,"King is the master of imagery. No matter how bizzare the setting, the monster, the dream, he manages to make the reader see, hear, and smell his surroundings. I enjoyed the story, particularly in comparing it with its companion THE REGULATORS. However, before the end comes, Stephen King twists this novel into a kind of weird political, anti-mining, wrath-of-God, destroying-Mother-Earth, left-wing, environmentalist tripe. If this kind of blatant political stridency annoys you, don't read this book. If you're calloused to this popular trend in modern art culture, though, you may enjoy the vivid imagery."
3,Mediocre King,"This book started off very promising. I really loved the idea of a small group of people being chased through a ghost town by a psychotic police officer with a hint of a bit more than madness behind his eyes. Suddenly, it degenerated into a bizarre monster story as King tried to turn it into another story of ultimate good vs. ultimate evil. I think King just doesn't know when to stop, especially now that he's written so many better novels. Perhaps he just feels he has to top himself with every book. Here's a tip: less is sometimes more."
5,Welcome back to the Maccabe SK!,"I have been an avid fan since 5th grade! I have been waiting for SK's books to pick me up and really scare me again! I haven't been scared this bad since I read IT or The Shining! I really loved the gruesome details that this book goes into. If you're really looking for a page turner, and something to keep you up all night, then you MUST read this book!"
4,Desperation and Regulators,"I am not sure if it is wise to compare these two books. The evil spirit Tak seems to be the common theme in both books, but I suppose, King could author many more books based on this Tak. Individually both books rate high on plot, action and readability. Desperation though seems to bring out the true essence of Tak via transformations and symbolism. In desperation, I found an uneasy comparison between Christianity and Islam through David and Tak--""tak ah wan- tak ah lah?"
5,DESPERATION,"This is the best book I've ever read. It's a mystery a drama and every thing else rolled into this book. My best part is is when Jonnie went into the cave to blow it up. I won't tell the whole story, especially to the people who have't read it yet. To sum it up you have to read this book."
2,Skip this one...There are other worlds than this!,"Before I say anything, let me begin by saying that Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and that IT may very well be my overall favorite novel (although I'm reading Jane Eyre right now, and it is climbing the ranks quickly...) These facts cannot, however, preclude me from critisizing Desperation. If you are the type of Stephen King fan that I am - one who appreciates his honesty, understanding of working-class America, and ability to brew characters to cry for - then you will want to skip Desperation, which ultimately plays out to be a blood bath broken record of Tak, tak, and more Tak (you'll understand if you don't heed my advice!) If you are new to King, and looking for a good book to start with, please consider 'Salem's Lot, IT, Hearts in Atlantis, Insomnia, The Stand, The Talisman, Different Seasons, The Shining, Tommyknockers, Bag of Bones, and, of course, The Dark Tower series (all representative of why we love Stephen King!)"
4,Desperation you could feel in each character,Excellent book. Couldn't put it down. The characters were interesting and there were smooth transitions in plot between them. Completely unpredictable and intense. Stephen King at his best!
3,An Up And Down Ride,"Having only read one King book (""On Writing"") before this, I was looking forward to it. Desperation was engrossing at times and tough to get through in spots. Many times it had the feel that the author was rambling to fill space. There were passages that filled pages and didn't add value to the story at all.Desperation is a very good story that could have been better told.In ""On Writing"" King recounts a lesson he learned early in his writing career; it is something to the effect of: ""Rewriting is writing minus 10%."" He was saying that, during a rewrite you eliminate 10% of what you have written. Desperation seems like he ignored his own advice. It was a very captivating story that could have used another rewrite."
3,A bit disappointed,"This was not one of King's better books. There were parts that kept me glued to the pages, but overall, I wasn't terribly intrigued. The end was hokie, but I guess that's sometimes expected with horror books."
4,This book was filled with horror and suspense,"This book was the first one that I have read by Stephen King. I found it graphic, scary and mystifing. The plot was well written the the ending was very surprising. Once I got into the book I coundn't put it down."
4,It was very thrilling.,"I love the Stephen King books. I never wanted the book to end. The excitment throughout the entire book was great. I usally get bored reading, but this book kept me on the edge. I hope there is a sequel to this one."
1,Couldn't finish this book...,"As a long time SK fan, I was disappointed by the premise that fans want to read about sick, twisted events before gaining any insight or emotional investment into the characters. I tried, and tried to get into this book, but just found it too depressing and sick to go on."
1,Blah...,"I read this book about a year ago, and I still can't figure out the plot. My advice to you is to save your precious time and money. Even Judy Blume can write a better book."
3,"OK, that's my honeymoon idea blown...","A spiritual trek down route 66 through the state of Nevada seemed like the perfect honeymoon to me until I read this book. King sparkles with some of his past magic in this terrific return to form. More graphic than past King, but not without reason. However, I too was puzzled by what point King was attempting to make about God and religion. I think he's pretty undecided. Anyway, no trapsing through the desert for me. Nevada is creepy enough without these images in the back of my mind."
3,Not up to his usual brilliance,"I was disappointed with this book, as well as The Regulators. These are the books from Stephen King that I read and promptly forgot. They were good entertainment while I was reading them, but they were just not ""unforgettable."""
5,Wow!,"This book was the best one I've ever read. It was exciting from the first word to the last and it was impossible to put down. I would recommend this book to everyone. No one should go without reading this, especially the Stephen King fans."
5,....on the edge of my seat.,"This book is absolutely amazing. It is a true testament to the writings of Stephen King. From the first page, the thrills are evident. Not a page was turned that I was ""NOT"" on the edge of my seat. There aren't too many books that make me lie awake in bed after reading it, wondering what was waiting for me in the darkness.....but this one did. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering reading a King novel for the first time. It will definitely get you hooked: without a doubt."
4,"Great Book, Far Better Than The Regulators","This book was much better than I expected. King managed to create great characters and a great plot. This book also managed to achieve something very rare: a couple of parts actually sent chills down my spine. There were a few instances of humor, and plenty of horror. As you might imagine with a book this size, though, it was a bit over written,though not until the last 250 pages. Other than needing to be a bit shorter, my only other problem with this book was the exessive Godly/Heavenly/Christian angle of this book, though that is a personal bias. Other than that, it was a great read."
1,His worst.,I think this is the funniest book King has ever written. Too bad I wasn't in a laughing mood.
2,How can you compare this to The Stand??!?!?,"It was awful! Boring. Contrived. Stephen King is an expert writer. He can whip out his signature prose right off the top of his head, and you can tell. The only problem is that he has absolutely no interesting story to tell in this book. He gets a good idea...""How about a crazy psycho sheriff"" and then he starts adding really stupid stuff just because he can't explain the original idea. Read Kathe Koja. Read Poppy Z. Brite. Stephen King will always be the master of horror, but there's new talent on the horizon. Move over Stephen, the new kids are coming in. You have gotten stale"
4,"Liked ""Desperation."" Hated ""The Regulators.""","I felt seriously disappointed, let down, and cheated by ""The Regulators."" But ""Desperation"" evens the score. I don't think it's among King's _very_ best. I'd say, don't miss it--but it's OK to wait for the paperback.I think this is the first King novel that has dealt so explicitly with an almost conventional Christian/religious subplot... King talks about God in this one, not just about generalized vague forces of good and evil. Have to go back and read ""The Dead Zone"" again... Well, I'm not a conventional Christian, but if I can accept it in C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien I can accept it in Stephen King."
2,Great beginning but King should stick to short stories.,"Desperation started out fast and it showed a lot of promise, but halfway through it turned from a horror story into a crazy supernatural yarn. By the time the book starts to drag you've read 350-400 pages so you've sort of feel obligated to finish it. The ending is really lame. It's like King ran out of ideas but had to submit the manuscript to meet a deadline. It you want to read some good Stephen King try The Bachman Books, Different Seasons, or Four Past Midnight. King writes great short stories but his novels are too long and have lousy endings."
1,SOMETHING STINKS,"This book is hard to put down once you start, due to King's style that just sucks you in. But by the middle, you start to realize that it just plain sucks. It's like King tried to parody himself, glueing plots from It , Tommyknockers, you name it, together. Save your money."
5,If only there were 6 stars....,"This book was my life for two weeks, and I must say that they were very entertaining! I LOVED Desperation. It made me feel good reading a book so thought provoking, with that classic King element of good vs. evil. I truly cared for David, and that young man had my sheer admiration from the moment he was introduced into the story. Desperation has to be one of the best books that I have ever read!!! Faith is a beautiful thing, and Desperation examines it in the heart of a boy, and how his faith affects others. King has outdone himself by writing a beautiful, yet totally gory epic. You totally captured me King. I read the Regulators afterwards, and was letdown, but Desperation is what my standards are measured by. Bravo and keep it up!!!!!"
4,"Not bad, kept my attention....but not his best work.","This book didn't have the power of THE STAND, or even SALEMS'LOT (which really scared me all those years ago!) If you're a die hard SK fan, go ahead and read it. His best works for me are still LOT, CARRIE,THE SHINING, and THE STAND!"
2,not the best Stephen's novel,"of course this book's better than Regulator but it's still doesn't make any sense. i know it suppose to be scary but it turns out to be boring. from my point of view, this book seems like just repeating itself and Stephen King's just adding words, phases, sentances, paragraph to make the story longer and fill in those pages."
2,Thank God Bachman is dead,"The book was good. Only one problem, all the characters sound like the same person. Very dissapointed."
2,Desperation,"This book was pretty descent. Nowhere near as good as some of his others,but moderately entertaining."
2,Another boring King offering...,"The first third of Desperation is actually pretty good (that's why I gave it two stars). A crazy cop hunts down people and murders them. But then the ""bad cop"" disintegrates into the Tak monster and the book goes downhill from there. The story starts off in suspenseful realism, but King clumsily turns everything into a supernatual bloodbath. He tries to offer deep religious symbolism to the grand fight between good and evil, but I just didn't care.King's best days seem to be in rear-window. Dead Zone, Different Seasons, The Shining, and The Stand (bit too long, but good stuff) were superb works, but virtually everything King has written in the last 15 years pales to those early books."
1,You'd have to be desperate to read this one!,"This is the only book that I have ever actually read one third of the way through and threw in the garbage. I couldn't even conceive having it around much less read another page. Stephen, the old ways were the better ways."
1,"stick to short fiction, stephen, my boy","As a writer, I absolutely hated this book. You must have an incredible suspension of disbelief in order to even begin to like it. Using the ""God"" device became highly repetitive and even more highly predictable, even worse than the Wesley Crusher syndrome. The rest of the book was fairly well constructed until it came to the end, when it looks to me as if King suddenly realized the deadline was tomorrow and had to tie it up too quickly. He has the potential to be a classic author if he'll only stick to short stories."
3,Gory details???,"Gory details??? Maybe some of his images are sickening to the soft bellied mother of 2 suburban children, but my grandmother, a diehard king fan, and i do not see them as unnecessary. If you dont like it leave and leave the rumors that King is a horror novelist behind as well. He does not write horror novels, he tells tales and brings characters to life. Desperation was only saved by its dealings with a form of ""evil"" that are a bit different than the classic forms of it and by the characters. If it had not been for the personalities and the normalness of the characters i would have stopped reading a long time ago. Had king not written the book i would have called it a triumph, but i expected much more from him."
1,This is bad,I was really disappointed when i read this book. How could anyone call this trash a come-back to Mr.King puzzles me. Reading this makes me think King has a major problem with God and faith. If youre confused King keep it for yourself. And Tak isnt what id call a grade A bad guy
2,I almost gave it one star ...,"And then I started reading The Regulators! What rubbish! Only by comparison does Desperation seem to have any worthy quality to it at all! The plot is drawn out and stagnant, and seems deliberately over-gross (a King trademark, I guess). And that title! Is it a new thing now to try so hard to mislead potential readers? I guess not; I did enjoy Salem's Lot after all. But this ... this ... ugh, just as well I give up hoping that King's more modern books aren't all the same kind of let's-feed-the-audience-some-left-over-ideas or just-for-the-heck-of-it-my-name-is-King-after-all second-rate story lines. Oh well, back to Cook and Grisham and Palmer and Cornwell and Koontz and ....."
4,"Great book overall, although some parts could be improved","This was one of those books that I had trouble putting down, that is, after I got past the first couple of chapters. There are some parts of the book that at times get a little slow, but King makes up for it by throwing in a whole lot of imagination and making the characters seem very real."
4,Great Book,"From the first page down to the very last, was excellent. I usually don't read his books, but this one belongs up there with Misery, Salem's lot, and the Shining"
3,OK but have seen better from King,"This movie deals with another good vs. evil plot, set in the remote town of Nevada with the same name. It starts out at a reasonable pace then drags in the last third. I'm an avid King fan and much of his work is variable. I would not recommend against buying this book. Just don't get your hopes up too high."
2,"Okay, but...","I only gave this novel 2 stars because I wrote a previous review on this King novel and bashed it unnecessarily. This book is a great one indeed, while being a bit long for the subject material, it is a deffinetly great read (if you like horror, that is)...sorry for the low rating."
2,I recently tried to read this book.....,".....but, after about 10 chapters I remembered why I quit reading King's work (after Misery), and put it down. Unbearable silliness. You would think that a mature author whom has mastered the art of the horror novel would eventually allow his sense of humor to mature also, but Mr. King has one of the most juvenile senses of humor of any author, in any genre, and it appears to be trapped in a 9 to 12 year old age bracket with no signs of ever maturing. So silly and unfunny is his humor, that it destroys any horror, suspense, or drama that he masterly brings forth. I don't consider myself to have an intellectual funnybone, but jeez, I do know the difference between silly and funny, and my ability to detect between the two caused me to put the book down...with no intentions of ever picking it (or his future work) up again."
5,King at his best,"I really enjoyed this book.To begin with all the characters are interesting and are introduced in an endearing manor. King demonstrates that he truely has a gift for dramatic writing and the book is a real pageturner.Without giving too much away King does a good job of putting the characters in the middle of a battle between to forces. The characters of ""God"" and the ""Tak"" are mysterious and mystical and add a deph to the book not found in some of King's other works.What this book really does well however is makes the reader feel as though he(with the characters) has been thrust into pure Hell. The reader really wants the characters to escape the town of Desperation but at the same time wants the book to continue."
4,All in all...a pretty good book,"Definitely a very insightful book. I'm not one for reading ""Cristian"" books, but it added to the story. Especially with the war between the two Gods. I encourage everyone to read this book whether they like King of not!"
5,King is king!,"Desperation was...well, GREAT! Stephen King has really written a page burner here. He returns to his old grounds with a supernatural horror/thriller but that is by far too simple of a description for what Desperation is. The book has a really great cast of characters who you really begin to care for and see some of each one in yourself. Also the way the King has set this book up is magnificent in that it fits together perfectly and delivers the story in a grand way that produces the great reading that I have now come to expect from King. I have read a handful of King's other books and I would have to say that this is my favorite. I enjoyed the Green Mile but I loved this one even more. I can't wait to get my hands on The Regulators. If you have ever read Stephen King and liked it then get this one. If you have never read one of his books this is a great place to start. Enjoy the addiction."
3,Average King,"This is not the best that King has written (The Stand is), but it was still okay. I diddnt really think the plot was great in the begining, but towards the end it got better. Steve and Cynthia were my favorite characters."
3,Great Up To The Half Way Point,"This was the kind of horror I knew Mr. King was capable of. He was raising the bar in fact. But as it progresses to the finish, King knows exactly how to take the horror out of horror with the mindless detail and tedium he is so expert at. Who is minding the store? Is anyone giving him honest feedback? I mean ruining a horror novel like this one is really a tragedy. I just wish I could write as good as his worst attempts though.Lots of religious dogma slung around so fundies should find this very paletteable. By the end I was just glad I made it through it. Better than Lisey's Story at least. This was my 24th SK(sick?) novel. FYI"
2,Not even close to King's best,"This may actually be the worst King I've ever read. I'll grant that it keeps you turning pages early on. But after a while the obsession with sex gets a little annoying. Even if not his worst, it's certainly his most vulgar. Additionally, this one wraps up in what I've found to be usual King fashion. Far too quickly and with little of the suspense and fear that the story starts with. As is often the case with his stuff, I found myself just wanting to get through the last 100 pages. Just to get it over with. It left me feeling cheated."
3,"Good book, but confusing with companion book","I can't recall which King (Bachman) book I read first, The Regulators or Desperation. The first one I read was good, interesting and a lot of action. The second one I read was confusing as heck. It's like King took all the characters, put them in a blender, and came out with the new book. The story is the same, the characters names are all the same, but now their characteristics are all different. A hero in the first book could be the bad guy in the second book. I couldn't seem to keep track of what was going on because I kept trying to reference the first book. I would give the first one I read 4 stars and the second one 2 stars, so they average 3. Not sure why King took this tack for these books. Strange. Overall, each one is a fun King story. If you like King, you should enjoy them. I just wouldn't recommend reading both. Stick to one or the other, and you should be happy. I wish I had."
3,Scary stuff!,"This is one of King's more graphic, horror books (like Pet Semetary). It surrounds a bunch of characters that were driving down Interstate 50 in Nevada and were unfortunate enough to be pulled over by a menacing cop. They are then taken to the town Desperation and all hell breaks loose. I thought this book was really good and pretty scary, some of the images are truly frightening. The reason it doesn't get more stars is that in the middle (for me) it was a little slower compared to the begining and end. But I still did really enjoy it. There's some religious overtones as well but not so much that it becomes cumbersome. Overall I think this is really interesting and scary book and I think it's a must read for horror/King fans!"
3,Alittle quarky,"This book, though interesting, was not a real hit with me - I'm used to Stephen King books with a little more pazazz, and then this idol being a sadistic aphrodisiac? it just wasn't working with me. Usually, Stephen King novels add more of a punch and...I can't exactly put my finger on it, but something was missing that needed to be in this novel. It may have kept me on the edge of my seat, but I wasn't about to fall off."
2,Is King a writer or a missionary?,"This is only the fourth King book I've read, and I'm sick to death of him. The first half I enjoyed. Tightly paced and very readable. There was just way too much Jesus-babble in the second half for my liking, and I grew extremely weary of the characters, all of whom I recognized from other King books and movies. I don't mind religion or spirituality, but King's world view is so narrowly Christian oriented that it alienated me. If I'm reading a horror yarn, I don't want a sermon."
4,Creepy and spine tingling!!,"A great book to pass your free time and be prepared to get goosebumps and tingles all over when reading (especially at night)! Stephen King's books are a true work of genius and this latest one rocks! Be sure never to pull over when a cop car has its sirens on when you are driving in the middle of the Nevada desert...the copy might just be Entragian,the psycho and main character of this novel!"
5,So real,"Stephen King is horrible in this book. Well- let's talk first. He makes the characters so likable and real, that when he kills them off; it's like losing a friend. Their personalities are like normal peoples. Wicked good book! But if you're kinda of soft, you might not like it. There's a part were Steve and Cynthia find a whole mess of dead people hung on coat hangers and a hand in an aquarium. Kinda gross, huh?"
5,"Great book,couldn't put it down,as all of his books.","I love stephen King books and movies.I collect them all,he is my favorite onlong with Dean Koonez.I have most all of his movies and books and some audio tapes.I perfer the audio tapes but are to expenive....I would love to met King,I think he is the greatest,I will be moving to New Hampshire soon,and I know he lives in Main.hopefully he will have a book signing or something ,then I can met him..good going Stephen King,keep them books coming.I get them as soon as they come out.and can harldy waite for the next one."
4,Bold move on King's part to actually make God an active part,"This book is one of many of King's about good versus evil, however, it's the first of his that I remember that actually gives God an active part. In THE STAND, the old woman represents the good. In his other works, the good is represented by other characters, but in this one, God is actually represented with Biblical quotes and parables. I like this bold representation of Spirituality, and applaud Mr. King for it. The story was suspenseful, and all of the things I have come to know and love in the works of my favorite author!!"
5,Superb! A refreshing change from previous stories,"If you read Rose Madder you may have been disappointed. I know I was. Desperation is Stephen King at his Horrifing Best! The story is an adventure in terror. Desperation is a town literally in the middle of no where. Here the evil Tak has escaped from its prison only to possess a police man and take his own prisoners. There are some very intense moment especially Taks transformation from person to person. This book is step in the right direction for King, especially after such bore fests as Rose Madder and Insomnia."
2,I finished it!,"And it was a bit of a struggle.After an approximate 10-year hiatus (I enjoyed several of his early novels, up to and including The Stand, as a teen-ager) I decided to go back for another thrill escape, but was disappointed.The novel does start out fun, but once I finally figured out what was going on, it was a labor to get to the end (which, however ballyhooed among my fellow reviewers, I did not find so great.)Of the two main characters, the writer stands up better. The boy was too good. Couldn't he have any bad traits at all? I'd have been grateful.Maybe I'm just not in the market for apocalyptic struggles of supernatural good vs. supernatural evil, as I was when I was a teen-ager.I do, however, still remember The Stand very fondly."
1,LAME,"This book started out with a lot of promise. And then, someone hit the autopilot button and we get a mix of boring, bogus characters who are either fated to be on the side of god, or servants to the evil ""Randall Flagg."" OH WAIT that was the evil guy in the STAND! Gee, it seems to be the EXACT SAME BOOK with even less reasoning behind the good/evil clash! It even has the same stupid ending the Stand did! *yawn*"
1,Put up your laptop and dust off your Royal Mr. King,"I'd like to believe that this piece of work was written by someone other than Mr. King but put under his name. Apparently gone are the days of ""The Stand"", ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", and ""Pet Cemetary"". I did enjoy the first few chapters but then it just bottomed out. One of two Stephen King books I put down as a waste of time. The other one was ""The Regulators"". My advice Mr. King is to take a vacation, put away your laptop, dust off the Royal typewriter, and give us some of that vintage King we all know you still have in you."
2,I've found better endings lurking inside used tissues.,"I admit I'm not a fan of Stephen King, but I will say Stephen King is very talented at bringing his characters to life. In all his novels I've read he has masterfully delved into the psyche of his characters; creating a very original and believable cast.HOWEVER, this book, like all his others, had an ending that made me feel cheated out of two days of my life.A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!"
1,Awfull !,"I have read a dozen of King's books, and, although all his books are different and sometimes have flaws, this one was simply a loss of money. Delirious characters, ""pure evil"" that finally appeared when I was half through the book (I must say I even didn't finish it at all), blood-bath instead of a plot. I am amazed how many people found this book interesting - or are they all under 15 years old?"
5,"Very realistic, I couldn't put it down!",Makes you feel that this could happen or is possible. King has a way of writing that makes you feel like you are actually there experiencing it yourself. I get so absorbed into his books. King mixes accurate facts and fiction together. It's a must for any Stephen King junkie. I couldn't put it down
1,lousy,"I was very disappointed in this book-I was so bored I didn't even finish it. Doesn't come close to his best work, ""The Stand.&quot"
5,Best book I've read this year,"I really like it when all the characters look prettynormal but you're not sure who's human and who's not -- who's gonna offer you a bag of potatochips and who's gonna take over your body to do the devil's work. Sorta like real life. I finally finished reading Desperation last night. Next thing I read will be something exceedingly light, like Dave Barry in Cyberspaceor something with Dilbert or Dogbert in the title. Here's a tip for you: Read Desperation. It's great. When you finish it late at night onyour favorite couch or reading chair, you can go ahead and put on all the lights leading up toyour bedroom and then turn them out one by one as you exit each room. That way you'll neverhave to be in total darkness until you get to bed. If you have The Clapper, you're in luck. Leave your bedroom light on, hide under the covers, then clap to turn the light off. Ignore any whispers or guttural soundsuntil you fall into a deep sleep."
2,What the hell was that?,"I've read a lot of Stephen King books and enjoyed most of them, but this is his worst one yet. You can tell he's running out of ideas when you read his most recent books like ""Gerald's Game."" Mr. King, either start writing good stuff again or retire with your fame and fortune but don't torture us with this crap!"
4,King says he's not a deep read and he's right,"I never understand people who say King is to dark, bloody, or just not deep. If you want a deep read, go away from the horror section and go get some political essays.(had to voice frustration) The book is pretty good, not his best. It's worth paying 7 bucks(if you're really cheap, to the library)."
5,"Inpseration, joy, respect for religos intervention, great","The book was one of three Steven King books that i've read. I personaly was thrild to read a book that was so inspiering to my own reilgos interest. Desperation was the first book that I've read that has ever done that, and I am glad I had a chace to have experionsed it. The insperation that the book gave me was one I will never forget, it both interiged me as well as arosed my thouths, and interist"
2,Read The Regulators instead,"I'm shocked that Desperation is rated higher than The Regulators. Granted, I did not read the entire book. However, I read nearly 200 pages and got to the point where I considered reading further to be a waste of time that could be better spent with better books. Desperation started off like it was going to be a real page turner, and I wanted to stay up all night to read more. But it peetered out as soon as the Carver family came into the picture. Bits were very entertaining, but wholly unsatisfying. The villian started off as quite frightening but his stupid, ridiculous dialogue and that of characters like Cynthia got on my nerves. I have to say I was glad to see the reference to Rose Madder (highly recommended), though. The Regulators was great, Desperation I couldn't get through."
2,Desperation - does well as a title and the author's motive.,"The first 2 chapters and vintage King. Stop there, and you won't be dissapointed. As far as the rest goes, I can sum it up in four simple words: repetitive, boring, predictable, and repetitive."
1,Bring on the editors!,"What is it with the publishers of King's books, that theyseem content to let him go on and on? Like other reviewersI enjoyed the start of the book, and the initial storiesof the highway travelers being pulled over were gripping,because, it could happen to you! (characteristic of manyearly King novels). A hundred pages in or so and we're backto King on automatic pilot where the verbage comes thickand fast. I couldn't be bothered to finish this, making thisthe second King book I have read to die of boredom (Insomniabeing the first, and if anything, the cure). King's earlierworks, Christine, The Dead Zone, even IT, were page turningthrillers. Lately he seems to be just a page churning filler.Mr. King, get a good editor, and stay away from 'uncut editions.'"
4,An amazing novel,"Desperation is a town in Nevada; it is also how people with unbelief feel. Something frightful and wicked has been released in the Nevada desert that had lain dormant for almost 150 years. How do you describe a force that takes joy in evil for the sheer pleasure of it? The plot moves fast from the beginning, with the horror starting from almost the opening pages, and the suspense grows with the turning of each page (I stayed up past midnight reading multiple nights). Once again King mixes story lines from past and present to reveal all the facts. The story grows and the scope of wickedness widens as you read. I found the novel to be very entertaining and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Stephen King."
1,The worst,"Awful ,B rated writing, I can't believe King let this one fly as two novels. Now if He were to have done The Green Mile under the Bachman name I for one would be joyful. This is garbage. Sorry Steven."
1,TERRIBLE!,"Stephen King is one of the worst authors in the field. I wonder how I even finished this one. There is no character development (frankly, the book would've been much better if every character within died) and no story. THE STAND, THE SHINING, and PET SEMATARY were equally terrible. Read Richard Laymon instead; stay away from this guy."
1,arrrrghhhh,"arrrghhh...i love horror stories but arrrghhh...this one was too predictable,and too too much of everything.There's a limit for everything you know?Stephen King may be the King of horror but..sorry..i couldn't finish this book...enough is ENOUGH!!!!"
5,INCREDIBLY PACKED BOOK,"I never read a Stephen King book before The Regulators, after which I was referred to this book by a friend. I picked up the book and saw that it was almost twice as long as the Regulators, so I waited a while to read. But once I started, I couldn't put it down. King's totally original idea for the villain (Tak) makes for the best storyline in any novel I've ever read. If you like Stephen King (which I suddenly do), this book has it ALL. And as for the ""left-wing paranoia"", it exists only within the mind of Johnny Marinville and is not an attempt by King to inject some of his politics into his novels. This book rises far above that with a moral that is stated over and over in the book itself."
3,well planned,"a policeman stops people on the road. there is something very wrong about this policeman- and his small town. something has happened. an evil force has presented itself. the people captured by the policeman must escape and stop it. first they have to find out what's going on. a boy seem to have closer contact with divine forces. this is a very ""planned book"". there are no irrelevant figures introduced, no sidetracks. very unusual actual. that part is great. good description. good writing style. a touch of psychology. frankly the touch of divine forces irritated me, and the author's sudden ""change"" really annoyed me. all in all this book wasn't very inventive. the ending must be considered an anticlimax. the characters ended up being a little too stereotypical. but hey, there was suspence here. and the plot just continued, without sidetrackes, admirably. so it's a good read."
5,The Author's Toolkit,This book was very helpful on a lot of things I did not know. It provided webs sites and other potential help books.
1,Smells awful!,"I prefer the original scent. Not a viable substitute. Smells like dirty old person. Do not buy! Great vendor, horrible item. Might be a hit in Indonesia...."
5,little notebook,was perfect for the project that I needed it for.. Lays nice and flat so can keep your page open.
3,Good but Expensive,"I purchased this product because I wanted a small notebook that I could add pages to as needed. This product arrived on time and in good condition. The quality was less than spectacular, and just above fair for the price I paid. In fact I would not recommend this product to anyone due to the cost and the average quality.I will be buying a small spiral bound notebook in the future at a fraction of the cost and just use multiples as an alternative. A very expensive lesson for me."
2,Bogus and biased,"They come up this kind of cobbling of old footage and ""computerized matchups"" every several years (remember ""The Dream Season"" from a while back?). Sorry but it is all bogus, even if morbidly fascinating.It is not only impossible, but horribly unfair, to compare teams of different eras, not to mention the dramatically different brands of football played in different eras (think of the dramatic changes in rules, differences in training regimens, technology, etc). Joe Montana and Jerry Rice could not have survived a pre-1980 style beating. Herb Adderley would have been booted out of the ""modern"" NFL for his vicious clothesline hits, and don't even talk about Dick Butkus and Ray Nitschke. The examples are endless.Such ""greatest ever"" debates always rage among sports fans as well as ""authorities"", but ultimately they cannot be settled. Undoubtedly, this new package will introduce new biases, favoring whatever today's fans want to see."
1,HAIL TO THE COWBOYS,"ANYBODY THAT KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL WOULD TELL YOU THE 90S COWBOYS WERE SIMPLY THE BEST DYNASTY EVER.IF THEY LINED UP AGAINST THE 60S PACKERS OR [THE MOST OVERRATED AND JUICED UP ON ROIDS TEAM EVER],THE 70S STEALERS,THEY WOULD GET STEAMROLLED BY THE BIGGEST BADDEST OFFENSIVE LINE EVER.AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THE ONSET OF FREE AGENCY,THAT TEAM WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS NO OTHER TEAM WOULD EVER MATCH,PERIOD.AS FOR THE 49ERS,THE COWBOYS BEAT THEM UP IN THE 90S AND THE 80S VERSION WOULD NOT HAVE FAIRED ANY BETTER.WITH TROY,EMMITT,MIKE,JAY,MOOSE,ALVIN AND THE DOOMSDAY 3 DEFENSE,NOT ONLY DID THEY TALK THE TALK,THEY WALKED THE WALK."
3,"Useful, but dated","At the time this book was written, it was a fabulous work of scholarship. The author was himself a staff officer in the Japanese Army and therefore knows his subject. He also sticks to it: the book is entirely an operational and strategic history, as opposed to a tactical one. In other words, if you looking for exciting stories, look elsewhere, because this is a top-down look at the Army's decision-making and strategy.Unfortunately, it's been over 40 years since Kogun was published. Nevertheless, surprisingly, it remains one of the best books on the Japanese Army in World War II. In contrast to the Japanese Navy, the Kogun has not received nearly as much historical attention as it probably should. Hopefully the topic will receive a more updated and detailed treatment, but until then this remains a useful book."
2,TOTALLY OUTDATED,"This is space rock [stuff]. It did not survive the test of time. The musicians are great, but the music sounds slow, tired and cold."
2,Couldn't make this diet work,This is a diet plan made up of eating nothing except for the last five hours starting at five. I really tried to make this diet work because the idea of the simplicity of it appealed to me. I just couldn't do it and feel mentally o.k. If you are like my husband and can go hours without eating and have minimal effect then this might really work but if you start to get shaky and bad headaches from not eating I wouldn't recommend this book. I felt like I was going to pass out one day that I got busy and did this diet plan. Maybe this would be a better plan for men than women. Just a thought.
3,A Dream Diet?,"The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the StartIn this modern age where everyone wants quick solutions, this could be a dream diet. I found the information interesting and credible and believe this lifestyle could work for some; the author is quick to point out that it's not a diet for everyone. For myself, I had too many unanswered questions and would have benefited from a longer, more documented read. Even though the author is a medical doctor (retired), the book seems light on research. I want more ""meat"" to convince me before giving this plan a try.I recommend, for the low price, you get a copy and read it for yourself. What do you have to lose? Either a little bit of money or a lot of weight!~ Brenda Nixon, M.A.www.brendanixon.com"
5,Works for me,"This diet while not for everyone, works just fine for me, I have tried many different diets, like counting calories, but all of them where hard for me to stick with over a long period of time.. Unlike other diets this diet gets easier after a few days when your body adjust to not eating for a few hours every day & you do not feel like you are starving yourself. I have been able to lose 1- 2 pounds a week to get down to my natural weight. I also run & walk but running alone will not take off weight without some sort of diet. I also think that this is a more natural way to eat. I try to eat healthy for 90% of my meals. The way I use it is like this, I don't eat anything until 2:30 pm and then I eat healthy food on an off until 7:30 pm, then I stop eating until 2:30pm the next day."
2,AVERAGE AT BEST,"This book had some interesting moments. And I love the idea behind the necroscope series. The problem is that Lumley does not do a good job at developing characters. They are all 2 dimensional. And there are no surprises, very straight forward and boring. The book is not fun, I do not reccommend this book."
3,A little better than the first book but still pretty lame :(,"3 stars! And this is because I am now sure that Lumley couldn't write a good book if his life depended on it :(Sadly - the book would be good if someone else was writting the parts concerning the 2 main characters. The ""supporting"" ones are rather good but this petty dwarves (Keogh and Bodescu) are really destroying the potential this book had. The guy simply can't write.Since I read a comment from one of the readers that this is his best series (out of many he created :D) I don't think I will waste the money on his books any more. Of course, I will read the third part but I really doubt that it will get better than this - and this is lame. Let's face it - Harry Keogh sucks (and not in the vampiric kinda way)My gift to Lumley (just for the effort of keeping Keogh's presence in the story minimal) is the third star for a book that should not have more than 2 stars in any rating system (which considers 3 stars better than 2 :D)"
1,LAME,The dialogue in this loser reminds me of the Nigerian solicitations I get via email. Its about as bad as an American tourist vacationing in China. I suppose awful English is supposed to make the Russians seem authentic. Do Russians speal pidgin english to each other in private?
3,Not as good as the orignal,"The Necroscope series and the saga of Harry Keogh continues in ""Vamphyri!"" sequel to Brian Lumley's vampiric masterpiece ""Necroscope.""This book covers some of the plot holes left behind with the end on Necroscope and covers new ground, including the story of Thibor Ferenzcy and how he ""created"" Yulian Bodescu. However, while reading this book one cannot help but get a feeling of déjà vu. The story is remarkably like that of it's predecessor. Once you get to the last chapters in the book, the ending is almost predictable since you've already seen what happened to Boris Dragosani in the first in the series.Told with Mr. Lumley's flare for weaving words, it is a quite enjoyable book. Once you start reading the series, it is one you don't want to stop. But the original Necroscope still reigns supreme in this reviewers opinion."
3,Not my favorite,"Its my least favorite book of the series, I did like the back story of ""the thing in the ground"" who will become quite a major character in the future."
5,Excellent Vampire Novel,Brian Lumley's ability to create such a brutally powerful world within our own is phenomenal. Never once did I feel like I was reading a book geared towards `young adults'. This the second installment in Brian Lumley's vampire series and it leaves you craving more.
5,Read the entire series,"This being the second book in the Necroscope series, it would be a good starting indicator that the series starts off pretty well... enough to get the second book.I read the entire series... and I'm not much of a reader. But this series is the exception to all rules. It's a completely new take on the vampire legend/mythos.Strangely erotic at times... horrific at other times... these books are like nothing I've ever read before. And some day I plan on re-reading the series a second time."
3,A Good Followup,"After having recently reading the first book again, I couldn't help but read this one right afterwards as well. I really liked it but not as much as I remember. While the story does pick up, the beginning is really a little slow. Lumley has a compelling style though that carries you through the lack luster parts and keeps you interested even when I thought the story lagged a bit. I was worth reading over though, if for no other reason, his spin on vampire lore."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"This book is a strange combination of advice for beginning sewists and advanced tips on finishing garments. A large portion of the book is devoted to making vests, which seems outdated. Styles featured in the book, in general, seem very 1980s or just odd and unflattering. There is also a lot of product pushing.On the positive side, there are lots of clear photographs and detailed instructions, so if there is a particular technique you are interested in that is covered in this book, you will find it helpful. The discussion of pattern sizing and ease is also good.Overall, I think this book could be useful, but it wouldn't be my first choice for someone getting started with the craft of sewing."
3,Not what I was looking for,"This book has some great tips, but it is for a rather advanced sewer. I'm certainly not a beginner, but I was hoping for some basic instruction, like how much fabric you should buy to make your own bias tape. I did like the zipper techniques, and have used them successfully. I thought way too much time was spent on vests. If you like Betzina's style and want to emulate it, you will probably get more from this book than I did."
4,"Not a intro to sewing book, plenty of great tips and tecniques","This book is not a learn to sew book. This book is to refine the sewing skills that you already have. This book is what would turn a beginner into an intermediate sewer.This book is hard to categorize. It is not a typical reference book as the topics included appear to have been selected at random, it appears to be an assortment of loosely related tips and techniques.I love the creativity this book encourages."
4,Firefighter Revolving Bookcase,This bookcase is just darling. Our grandson loves books and his room is all decorated in a firemen theme. It looks like it is very well made. He even wanted to store his fire trucks inside. I am very happy with my purchase.
4,Just a good album.,"You ever listen to something and think ""this is good, not great and not bad, just good"". That basically sums up the selections in this mix. I listened to Tiesto's In search of Sunrise before I got Space Age. Maybe I like Tiesto better alone. The mix progresses pretty quickly from the beginning. This is one of those cd's you can just put in the cd player, press play, and before you know it, it ends. That's a good thing, there aren't dull parts where you want to skip a track... but also there weren't really parts I wanted to go listen to again right away. I did enjoy the slower beats of this album. I do recommend this album."
3,It's what he wanted,"My four year old wanted this, and we've had it for 7 months now. He plays with it whenever the chalk is the toy of choice on the driveway. I think it's a little flimsy, but he gets the entertainment he wanted out of it, so all in all, money well spent and I'd buy it again."
2,"This is a Pilot, Not Star Trek","As Season Two was coming to an end, it was believed that Star Trek was going to be canceled. So what did Gene Roddenberry do? Did he stick to his guns and go down with his ship firing? Nope. Instead, he wrote a pilot for a series called Assignment: Earth. The show was not picked up and for good reasons. Gary Seven is so boring and the story is kind of lame. So basically, Shatner and gang are guest stars on their own show. This is not Star Trek; it is a pilot for a crappy series that didn't get picked up."
4,A music drama before its time,"The Salieri revival continues with this very strange opera - in some ways way ahead of its time. It is a play with music. The only real aria is the Barcarolle in Act 3. The rest is ""endless melody"" in service to the text. And the plot is pure Enlightenment - character counts above rank. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it enjoyable? Yes. This is a wonderful production. The singers are good. The staging is in character. If you want to see what music drama would have looked like 50 years before Wagner, let Salieri and Beaumarchais - yes, the creator of Barber and Figaro - be your guides."
2,Winsome Wood Valet,"While it looks likea nice product, the actual construction of this unti is virtually impossible. The screws do not fit and the allen wrench is made if a soft metal thatquickly strips out. I will likely need to tkae it to a place with a power drill to construct it."
2,not very visible,"you can not see very well the number because it is very dark and there is no light in this watch, but for the price i thjnk it is ok"
3,Audio cord too short,"The video connector works fine but the audio cord is too short to allow a hook-up to a PC (I have only a 10"" notebook) that has the audio output on the opposite side of the laptop from the VGA PC connector"
5,Amazing Value,"HD15 (SVGA) Male + 3.5 Stereo Male / HD15 (SVGA) Male + 3.5 Stereo Male, D / Shield, 10 ft - looked for this item and was amazed to find this great value from this vendor. Other vendors charge alot more money. This is an exceptional value. We use it for our Sony 46"". Works Great!!!Shop them for all your cable needs. GREEEAT VAlue!!!Will shop them for all our cable needs!!!!God bless you."
1,Bad audio quality cord,"We hooked this up to a computer tower, located protected In our entertainment cabinet. We hooked the other end of this cable to the back of our big TV. Video is great. Audio was great for a few weeks, then the low buzzing sound started. Since then, when we switch our TV input for use as a computer monitor, the audio has a buz sound that has consistently gotten louder. It is so loud now! So yesterday I fiddled with the cord finally. Hooked up fine, buz sound got worse. We threw the cable away. Don't buy."
3,A hard one for Van Vogt avid readers.,"I'm afraid i did not enjoy this book very much. The MASTER is known in his fluctuating quality of works ,and this one is not of the better ones.Not a bad book at all , BUT - somewhat slow ,the action-level is way down than the usual ,and the book is not as idea-filled as many others.Though written in '72 and being late Van Vogt ,it's not that. After all ""Battle of forever"" is from '71 ,and demonstrates perfectly the MASTER's simple ,almost naive ,yet ultra-imagenative ,and overwhelming ,never-read-before-and-since ,powerfull style.I would recommend it only to true Vogtians ,that know what he's capable of ,and just have to read whatever he wrote ,like me. Don't worry too much guys ,it's not as bad as ""Book of Ptath"" ,but no ""Silkie"" either."
5,Outstanding Product for the Money,"Great tool for the money! There are some higher end curb keys made for daily professional use but this one is very well made and good enough quality, and inexpensive enough, for the homeowner who may need emergency or occasional access, to a recessed valve. I have dearly wished I had one of these twice now and only bought after the fact. If you think you could ever possibly need one of these, get it now before hand - an emergency call to the Fire Department may be your only other option. Check local ordinance before using on utilities, such as a water main, other than in an emergency."
5,Movie that seems like a book.,"This is a quiet little movie that is very engaging. Very realistic I really liked the characters. Just when you think you know whats coming next, you don't like, ""didn't see that one coming"". All the characters seemed true. NIce ending."
4,Just Okay,"It is hard to rate a movie because everyone has differing opinions. I did think this was just worth the rental price. I didn't get a message from the movie except that people can be crazy, mean and wounded with no hope. Good thing that I kept in mind that this was made in Hollywood and not based on real life. Not a feel good movie, just a movie"
5,A truly wonderful book from a great Russian wordsmith,"In the introduction to this book, some compare Chekhov's writing to lace: the beauty of his stories are as much about what's left out as what's left in. Indeed, to a certain extent, that is true. In this book you will find some of the most gently funny and heartbreakingly poignant stories ever written. His writing is almost that of a parish priest recounting the tales of his town, in that he passes no judgement on even the most vile of the characters he has created, but instead allows us to judge each character for ourselves. It's a wonderful glimpse, not only at late-Czarist Russia, but at humanity in general. I highly recommend this book."
5,A Cuban Oldie but Goody,"Havana in the 1950's. Nobody recited Afro-Cuban verses like Luis Carbonell. Is it true that he was shot by Castro's people while trying to escape? Go back, go back and hear the rythm in his voice. Why am I writing this in English? Because he said ""I'll Try"". Los Quince de Florita-- Espabilate Mariana-- Coge el chicle la menta... Recuerda tus raices. Amen."
3,I used this product and it didn't really ...,"I used this product and it didn't really change the color very much. It might be because I have very thick hair and it's medium length. What I did notice is that it made my hair a lot softer then it was. This is very good for me -- I live in Florida and am in the sun a lot, and it has helped my hair very much with the dryness. I think if I'd used two boxes it would have helped with the color."
3,"I found that the product worked well, but ...","I found that the product worked well, but I had to buy the toner afterwards for the ultimate golden effect. If you plan on buying the toner, then this product is definitely for you. If you don't want to spend the extra cash, then it would be better to get your hair done professionally."
5,"A good read, just as good when reread!","I recently reread The Cutout and was completely awed by Mathews's command of pacing, dialogue, and story arc. It is a thriller that is meticulously crafted with abundant and authentic detail, and yet it grabs you by the collar and pulls you along for a genuine roller-coaster ride. Even though I ""knew"" the story, I was still so absorbed by the it that I read the book in two marathon sessions. It is a rare modern thriller that is written well enough to stand up to the scrutiny of a second reading and that reveals new nuances and discoveries to the returning reader. This is one of them that repays a return visit. As a writer of thrillers myself (Web Games,The Dome, andBashert), I have high standards for the genre. Francine Mathews sets the bar and is one of my heroes."
2,OK but give it a rest!,"Interesting writing with a quirky viewpoint at times. I liked the book till she started throwing in negative comments on males. Every so many pages we are treated to more examples of female persecution,at least in her mind.Could have been a great read if she just dropped her political agenda."
4,Captivating,"It was a pleasure to find myself engrossed by the characters and believe the fiction. While I truly enjoy books with swashbuckling heroes, somtimes they can be unbelievable. This was very believable. There was no superhero here, just a number of characters who were seemingly real and motivated by defined principles. I will read another book by this author."
4,Bangin',"I think that this album is great. I've been a fan of her's for years. My favorite song is ""It's all about you( Not about me)"".I would recommend this album to anyone."
5,Still In My Heart,"I love this CD. Still In My Heart is my fave song, i lsten to it all day long. Its super!"
1,dissapointed,"I was dissapointed in this book because it gives a lot of data but not any practicle application, no diet plans."
1,complete waste of money and time,"This book is a complete waste of money and time. It reads like an ad for the latest diet craze with primary reliance on anecdotal personal stories. When it is not being repetitious, it's going off one on one of it's frequent tangents. It never get specific on it's title theme and often seems to contradict itself. I'll give this one to the library so other people don't have to waste their money on it. Try one of the other books on this subject, it's got to be better than this one."
3,very good for people who are new to a healthy diet.,"It seemed to me he was just trying to get people to eat a healthy balanced diet of 2,000 cal. Easy to read and understand. I wanted more."
1,The longevity diet,"Did not like this book - other readers may enjoy it but having studied nutrition, I found it hard to digest."
5,Looks don't matter; HEALTH does!,"Trying to ride Brian and Lisa's coattails, Mr. Elixxir... I mean, Mr. Spence? That's a pretty pathetic way of promoting your own book, and also your business of preying on desperate rich people who will believe anything you tell them. Both Walfords and Delaney are not writing about how to make yourself *look* younger -- that has more to do with the Sun than anything. They're writing about how to keep yourself functioning in a healthy, youthful way for as long as possible.Roy Walford gave his life helping humanity learn how to ""reach for the stars"" -- by participating in the Biosphere 2 experiment, and suffering a toxic poisoning that ultimately killed him. His CR practice kept him alive longer than most people with his diagnosis. To insult his heroic effort is to insult all that is good and noble about humanity. You should be ashamed of yourself."
2,Long on anecdotes short on new research,"There was little new information compared to the original CRON diet book. The original Walford book provided a better detailed explanation of how to follow this program as well as the scientific basis for his theories. That book was a little harder to digest b/c of its technical language, but it is far superior to this latest book. I got much more out of the CR Way by Paul Mcglothin and Meredith Averill."
2,wouldn't buy this again,"This book was very vague with the information it provided. I researched the diet on-line for free and was able to find as much if not more information than the book provided. As far as the diet itself...they aren't preaching anything new or enlighting. Just your standard, consume fewer calories...make those calories nutrition packed...yada, yada, yada. I would recommend saving the money you will spend on this book to buy the healthy foods it will suggest...like salad."
3,Much to Appreciate,"Even if one does not follow any of the recipes in this book the reader will get a good feel of what kinds of foods are most important for proper nutrition. But the bottom line is simply that the reader can improve their chances to live longer by eating high nutrition foods but, with less calories then you burn, until you are real skinny. Then diligently stay skinny by eating the right amounts of the most nutritious foods. Severe exercise programs are discouraged."
5,complete and easy to follow,"delaney and walford really know their stuff. like any good book, ""the longevity diet"" is hard to put down. seemingly complex information is presented in a very reader-friendly way. when you get halfway through the book, you are instructed to put the book down and record what you normally eat for one week ... your normal eating habits of when, what, and how much. honestly, it was hard not to keep on reading but i put the book down and focused on the task at hand. now, i'm on the second half ... the part where you design the diet that meets your lifestyle based on ""how"" your body tells you to eat. i'm actually excited that the recording week is over and i can get into the design phase!!!"
1,Didn't explain much,"I thought this book would be the most informational since it's written by the president of Calorie Restriction Society but instead it talks about Calorie Restriction in great platitudes and vaguely references any real steps, there are no directions or practical advice.Worst of all, in every chapter, nearly every page, there is a mention that ""Calorie Restriction may not be right for you"" or ""If you're thinking this may not be right for you..."" which is really annoying. I had already thought it was right for me before I picked up the book, why would the author keep trying to talk me out of it?"
1,ok,It had the one song I was looking for and I was thrilled to find it! The other songs didn't thrill me!!
5,Works Great,The HDMI cable works great and produces High Definition video over a 75 foot distance from our overhead projector to the receiver. Works great as expected !
4,Love the book,"Another item bought as a gift, unfortunately doesn't have Hawaiian translation in the back as the other James Rumford book. Beautiful story and pictures."
4,Childrens Educational DVD,"We love the little Einstein series, we own them all but one. Very easy to watch over and over without getting bored. They use big words with such excitement and there's so much to learn. You pick up on something new each time. Highly recommend!"
5,My 4 year old grandson loves it.,I bought this for my 4 year old grandson's birthday and watched it with him. I was as delighted as he was. I was especially impressed how classical music and the sciences are interwoven and loved the lack of violence.
3,Not as good as 99,"When I first bought this game I could not wait to get it home and start a season. However, I was a little disappointed in some aspects of the game. The graphics are a little better than the previous version, but the play is eratic. The passing game is three times as difficult to master as the original, and even then the quarterbacks seem to throw the ball differently every time they drop back. Also, the receivers give up on their routes too easily. Most of the time you try to roll out the receivers stop their routes and come back to the ball. Lastly, the game is penalty happy. Good plays get snubbed out due to holding calls, and if a receiver decides to run in to your safety he will get flagged for interference. Don't get me wrong, this is still a very playable game, but for pure playing enjoyment I still recommend NCAA '99."
2,When playing at the Varsity level this game cheats!,"I like the graphics and sounds associated with this game. The problem is when you play against the computer at the Varsity level it cheats in order to win games. It is unbeatable. For example, if I score a touchdown it calls a penalty and nullifies it. On defense, no matter what type of deep coverage I call, it continues to complete passes against me. If I play against the computer at Varsity level it is unbeatable. If I play it at Junior Varsity level then I destroy it. The game needs a middle-of-the-road level."
3,989 Did a Better Job,"After playing 989's NCAA Gamebreaker 1999 for a few years, I thought that I would venture out on the EA Sports side and see what they had. I choose this game because of the option to play in a dynasty mode. It was a year newer then my current game and I expected it to be a tad bit better then NCAA Gamebreaker 1999. I liked the dynasty mode and the announcing on this game. The rest of the game didn't strike me as anything overly good. The graphics were worse then my NCAA Gamebreaker 1999 game. I expected the game to be a lot better then what I ended up with. I am disappointed in EA Sports."
2,Doesn't work,"I've used this product for months on several dark marks on my body, and scars in particular... to no avail. I'm going to try something different. I selected this product because it is supposed to be beneficial for black/African American skin tones, but I haven't been successful."
5,"Well written, researched and titled","This is a fascinating read about how understanding hacking, from gathering the data, to the forensic analysis. The second part, on the forensic analysis is very detailed and well written.The root idea is very simple, put an attractive target on the Internet, wait until it's hacked (and it will be), and then analyze the attack. The first part of the book covers the construction of these attractive 'honeypots'. The second part covers how to analyze the inevitable attack. The third part, which is the most high level, is about the culture of hacking and hackers.I would recommend this book to anyone involved in securing systems on the open internet who has a good understanding of the technology behind networking and operating systems."
1,not enough information,I was disappointed when the shoes arrived and they were leather. I was hoping they were canvas. The product description did not specify and only stated that they were stretch. I had purchased a pair of stretch Keds before in a different design and they were canvas.
5,"this is a good book, but what is even funnier is that...","this book is on sale for .01 of a cent. That is less then a penny. meaning, that you could by ten of these books for a penny."
1,How does work like this get published?,Above and beyond boring. I cant believe that writers like Ms Hawkins are taking up bookshelf space.
3,Confessions of a Scoundrel,Amusing but shallow. Love the interplay of the brothers.Confessions of a Scoundrel (Avon Romantic Treasures.)
3,"It's ok, I've had better","It's not bad, I've just had better. I can't get to specific because I haven't heard it in so long. I'm not using it, if that helps. I listened to it once."
5,Am I the only one who has heard tracks from this FIERCE CD?,"Okay boys and girls, this CD is jam packed with fierce gay themed music that will keep your feet tapping, butt shaking, and help remind you what true diva style is . . . attitude. Recommended to anyone who can appreciate every aspect of who they are, whether butch or fem . . . don or diva . . . straight or gay . . . this is a CD to dance along to . . . or in my case . . clean my house to . . .(I need that kind of fierce motivation)"
4,THRILLING!,It was very cool how the aqua apes came aroung in this book. One of R. L. Stine's best yet. Ending is shocking!
4,Great book!,Great book! It is a story about two boys who want sea monkeys. Suddenly a sea monkey ate other sea monkeys and grew large!
3,Not A Scary Book it's an adventure book!,"I rated this book 3 because it's not a scary book it's an adventure book. Scott and Glen used the water in Fear Lake for their aqua apes to grow. Scott notices it's teeth, it grows sharper."
1,Can't they make a bubble blower that works?,"Got the toy yesterday, followed the directions exactly and not a single bubble. The motor blows air but I don't see that the wand is coated with solution no matter how much we try. Piece of crap, which is a shame b/c my son was really disappointed."
2,Okay,"Like so many other books written by corporate presidents selling creative thinking, it is full of how I did this job at this prestigious company. A marketing exercise rather then a book to advice you how to do it.I found that it had few ideas."
5,Laurel & Hardy Quiz Book,Big Quizness (Laurel & Hardy) book is informative & good fun with rare amusing info.It is big book for a paperback it's 400 pages.Highly recommended and slightly rare.Petet
5,Perfect for everyday,I bought these earrings a couple of months ago and I love them! They came in a beautiful velvet pouch and gift box. They are simple enough to wear every day and go with just about anything. I plan on ordering another pair to keep as a spare in case I lose one.
3,"NOT BAD, IF YOU TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS","This movie was not meant to be ""scary."" It is more of a suspense movie with a plot that causes many sex scenes to take place. That is the type of movie it is. If you like that type of movie, go for it. You will get your fill. If you want a suspenseful horror flick (with less sex), try one of my personal favorites,""the Unholy."" It is a lesser known movie that will definitely be worth a look."
1,Should Be Swept Away,"Scenario: Friend wanted a movie with sex and I wanted a horror movie. Compromise: Stormswept...supposed to be erotic horrorResult: We were both disappointed...very disappointed.The basic premise of the movie is that a group of people end up in a creepy old mansion which is haunted by a ghost that periodically takes over members of the group and thereby causes them to get extremely horny. Sounds intriguing but it is absolutely awful!!! This is as scary as a Disney movie...aside from the creepy house, nothing is remotely frightening. The erotic/sex part of the movie is anything but erotic or even arousing. The picture quality is bad, the acting is worse, and the plot is the worst. Stay away from this wretched flick!!!"
4,Great Reading,"My daughters ages 9 and 12 really liked this story. This is one book that I've seen them read on their own and I didn't have to ""force"" them to read. We can't wait for book two to come out!"
5,Works great,"Other reviewer had problems with typing, but I speed type and it works great. Only thing that takes getting used to is the trackpoint for the mouse control, but after you get the hang of it, works well.Been using media center since it was first introduced, and this works great with it. I'm about 15 feet from the TV in my great room, and have no problems with control. All the media center functionality with the buttons to jump to functions quickly."
2,"Nice design, poor function","I saw this at a friend's house and was impressed by the nice layout, keyboard & mouse functionality, and light weight. I didn't try typing on it. I should have.This product is fatally flawed, in that even with new batteries and pointed right at a nearby receiver, you have to type very slowly (S L O W L Y) and deliberately, about 1 keystroke per second, because if you type faster, it will drop keystrokes. That's in the best case. If I try to use it normally, not pointing it straight at the receiver, it's even worse. I've used other wireless IR keyboards which were much better, even older ones."
3,maybe to old?,"I wish I could listen to the CD's before purchasing them. I have the most recent ""DJ Tiesto"" CD's and I love them; a lot of energy, but this is a little slow. Maybe because it's an old one, but still great quality."
5,A+,"Another great tiesto collection, it's not like in search of sunrise's, has a different atmospeheric tune to it. It's awesome if you wanna kick back and have trance/house beat through-out your day. Would recommend"
2,Ho-Hum,"I love music, and I divide it into two broad categories: music that I devote all my attention to, and music that I'll put on the spin if I want something in the background while other stuff is going on.This CD falls into the 2nd category. Very generic stuff when, given DJ Tiesto's name, I was really hoping for an experience. A good album should make me feel like I've been somewhere, sort of like reading a book. Didn't happen for me."
2,Tiesto's weakest CD,"I am a big fan of Tiesto, esp. the ISOS series, but this CD was truly disappointing. I found it to be bland throughout, with no particularly inspiring melodies or peaks. By far the weakest of the Magik CD's, and the worst Tiesto CD that I have heard.Save your money and buy any of the ISOS series or Magik 1,4, or 5 instead."
3,Broken by a toddler... twice!,"Great book, but it was entirely too easy for my pint-size Hercules to pull the sliding parts all the way out, breaking the book in the process."
4,What a cool book!,"My son became fascinated with this book around 10 months, and 14 months later, still loves reading it. Over that time, he has used the book to learn colors (the freight cars are different colors) and things like the items that freight trains carry. He now loves watching trains from our back porch and knows more than steam engines than a lot of adults.But alas, the book has not held up well due to repeated abuse at the hands of a toddler. Several patch-up jobs with clear packing tape have given the book a stay of execution."
3,inside freight train,"The book wasn't quite as it was discribed. It was in a little poorer shape than I was expecting it to be. I needed to make repairs to it before I was able to use it. Now that it's been repaired, I'm happy to use it."
1,Please learn to spell CALVES properly before publishing a book!,"It is $10 wasted for me because my younger son tore the cover into 3 pieces the first time he got his hands on it, and before I had a chance to look through all the pages. Yes, it was that durable! This book went to the bin a week ago when my older son started sounding out words and we didn't want him to get the wrong start. Can't someone spellcheck a book before it is published? I'm surprised that noone has caught that mistake in the 4 years since it was published. Shame on the author and the publisher!"
4,Rain Bird SST12000,"Unit received as promised and was easy to install with stab-in wire connection points. Worked as stated, and easy to program. Wish that it had a way to set a three or four day schedule, but this is only a minor problem. Goo product for the money."
3,Facts on Rats,"I had read an earlier edition of this book and thought the book needed updated. When I bought the recent edition and read it, I was disappointed. The facts are there, but as previously noted, there are no citations.I grow weary of the same old 19th century drawings of rats that appear in this and most other books dealing with rats. I guess real photos just don't look menacing enough. Rats get lots of bad press. These old illustrations just add to it. The book is history, however and these are presented as such. If a book is about rats, all I ask for are illustration that look like rats.The book is a good read. Packed with information, humor and insite, it has a lot to say. The title is very appropriate. With an animal that is as cunning, diverse and adaptable as the Rat, genetic engineering needs to appoach with a bit of caution."
5,Interesting,"What an interesting non-fiction read. Our family owns pet rats so we know what funny and intelligent creatures they are. So, we're naturally interested in rats. Read this book and learn how rats shaped history in ways you cannot even imagine."
2,Cheap Product (But Not in Price),"I purchased these Dominoes versus others because I wanted the ""traditional"" look. These look like plastic, not wood. The dots are small and painted with such a thin coat of white that it is not that easy to see the white against the black.Not at all recommended."
4,"Wow, They Still Make These",I really couldn't believe Amazon was carrying wooden Dominoes. Haven't seen them for years. I got them for my little boy who loves to line them up and knock them over. Sooo much nicer than the horrible clincking sound of the porcelain ones he's been using(I hid those). Quality is decent. Only found one that was not cut to the same height as the rest. Great price and oh so easy on the ears!
1,take off of many other artists,"In most of the songs you can tell the writer has taken bits and pieces of many other songs and has put the music into his own words. You can pick out music from other groups such as Bon Jovi, Alice Cooper, the Beatles as well as others. The words may be original but the music is not. The lead singers voice is out of tune and raspy and hard to listen too in most of the songs but the musicians themselves sound pretty good. Save your money."
1,lament,"I wasn't received this item so far, is more than a week delayed, due to I can't have an opinion on that."
2,Alright For a Best Of But...,"A good greatest hits album for Cowboy Junkies but really not the best representation of the groups' early career. All their top hits are here to be sure but there are songs on this album that doesn't fit the catagory of ""Best Of"". They're not bad songs just not really worthy of being included among their best work. Plus there are a couple of legitamate hit songs by CJ (""Powderfinger"" and ""A Horse In The Country"") that are not included on this CD. Why? Also from what I have heard and what has been mentioned in a couple of other reviews this is an album that was made without the blessing or contribution from Cowboy Junkies. Having said that I recommend if you want or need a greatest hits album by Cowboy Junkies your better bet is to buy ""Studio"". In my opinion it's just a better album that is much more complete in keeping with the idea of what is the ""Best OF"" CJ."
3,Morning music,"This is what I call Sunday morning music. Nice cup of coffee, paper and this music. Lead singer is Nora Roberts (slow), Paula Cole (key), and Melissa Etheridge (throaty) all in one."
5,Great collection,"This is a great collection of their songs. I don't own any other of their discs, so this one had a lot of their work that I liked on one disc."
1,Don't buy on principle,"This CD was put out without the blessing of the band. In fact, they would prefer you to download their tunes off the Internet instead buying it. And besides, so many of their albums are so good I can't imagine being able to pick a handfull of ""best"" songs. CJ fans, for sure, would not be interested in this CD. Neophytes would do well to explore in my order of preference Black-Eyed Man, Miles from our Home, Open, the Trinity Sessions, etc. Really can't miss with this fine group of musicians who deserve and merit the respect of their devoted fans, me among them."
3,It's alright... I suppose,"Even though I have all these songs on other CDs of theirs, I decided to buy it just to have in my collection. However, I find this 'Best of' disappointing because there are very few songs here I consider the 'Best of' Cowboy Junkies. If you really want to hear the 'Best of ' this group, go buy ""Lay it Down"", ""Black-Eyed Man"", and ""Trinity Sessions"". To me, that is the best of the Cowboy Junkies!!"
1,SUPPORT CJ'S: DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"Go to cowboyjunkies site. They have asked their fans NOT to buy this album in which they were not involved in any aspect of its making and are highly insulted by these producers making their ""best of"" behind their back. They would rather have you download mp3's and burn your own cd. At least that's what Margo said at the concert where I saw them live this summer. BMG has pulled out to honor their request, but RCA has not."
4,Good Starter For New Junkies Fans,"This is a nice collection for anyone not familiar with Cowboy Junkies. However, any best of without ""River Waltz"" or ""Bea's Song"", two of their best, is incomplete. But this is a great listen and I would recommend it to any new listeners. Kind of like Cowboy Junkies with training wheels. If you like what you hear, move on to some of their other albums, all of which are great!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD!,"This is an inferior product not endorsed by the band. It was released by a music company which owns the rights to some of their old music. The band told them they were not interested in participating, but BMG made it anyway."
5,Mature Movie,I have never seen the series but I still loved this movie.It deals with emotional difficulties very well particularly love triangles.The movie didn't have much action but it was still impossible to stop watching.The ending was perfect they showed exactly the right amount of the main characters first time and didn't exploit it like most shows do.I would recommend this to people who like romance shows but be warned this isn't like any other romance anime I've ever seen.This is not too soppy but more realistic and deals with the important things in life.
4,Whimisical Romance,"Picking up where the OVA and Movie left off, New KOR has our hero jumping in time. it neatly shows what the future will hold Kyosuke. the character design is not by Akemi which is a bit of a negative, but the story makes up for it. KOR fans should definately pick this up"
5,Great parrot toy!,"Lucky the Red-Lored Amazon is still chewing on the remains of this colorful toy and it's two months since Christmas. The beads are strung on leather so it's tough enough to last a while, while maintaining his interest. Buy several items at once from this company and you can save on combined shipping. Doesn't your little guy deserve a special toy now and then? Prices from this company are excellent!"
3,I wish I had known it was a Christian book!,"Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I was expecting something more spiritually rounded with stories from all different faiths. The stories are short, but the photography in this book is excellent. The pictures are of beautiful scenic backdrops. I would recommend this book even for just the pictures. The stories were nice, but as I said I was hoping for something more..."
5,Good Book,"I am a professional financial advisor. I use this book with clients. When I have a new client that starts with me I typically get them a copy of this book. It is the most consise and easy to understand book on money and investing that is available today. I believe that everyone that has to deal with money should use this. I promise that you will take something away from it everytime that you refer to the book. You should keep this book near a place that you watch tv or read. This way when you here or see something that you may a question on, this book will be an easy reference."
2,Not an applicable book,"This book shows a reader what investing is about but this wasn't the type of book I was looking for. I was actually looking for a book that shows how to invest excellently in the stock market. I think the authors of this book didn't want to dissappoint certain investing approaches, thus didn't give their opinions on what type of investing is a way to go. Rather, they just showed what investing was about. If you want a book to improve your investing skills, don't buy this. But if you want a book just to understand investing, buy it.Personally, I'd rather have a book that shows the outlined techniques that show how to apply the information rather than to just understand the broad spectrum of it."
5,The title explains itself!,"This is a great guide to help in teaching you about money, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, futures and options. You will learn how each of these instruments works with clearly defined terms and definitions to guide you in understanding the financial markets and how they correspond to your money. All relevant financial terms are defined in this easy to read guide that serves as a great book for a beginner, and will help clear up anything you may not understand about the financial world."
2,A young and confused reader.,"I'm 15 and I read this book. What I have to say is that this book is confusing. If you do not know anything about money and ivesting, do not, and I say do not, buy or read this book. Now if you want to define some financial terms, this will help, a little."
2,If you were raised in a cave this book has lots to teach you,This book should be given a pass. It covers items so basic that one would have to have been raised in a cave to not know 90+% of what is covered. I was very disappointed.
3,a good reference,"This book is a good reference book, but it is very difficult to sit down and read through. If you really want to learn about stocks, it might be better to get a book that has more examples and real life applications. This book is great for looking up terms, but I wouldn't recommend it as a textbook for learning about investing."
4,"OVERALL, A FINE MONETARY GUIDE","The entire five sections of this book are loaded with rich financial information. They are well-illustrated too! In fact, the only correction I think that the authors should make is to expand the information a little bit.At just 160 pages, I felt that a lot of important issues were overtly summarized. Though useful, the ubiquitous pictorial illustrations consumed a lot of space. (Potential) investors are no kindergarten kids, and I suggest that in their next review/edition, the authors should replace most of these pics with write-ups. Readers enjoy the gists more!Well, it remains a fine book overall."
4,Excellent Value. Slow delivery though.,"I got this book for less than $1. So excellent value. It was shipped within a week, but it took about another 2 to 3 weeks to deliver."
3,"A Nice, Concise Introduction to Finance and Markets","As a starting point for someone unfamiliar with finance and financial markets, this book is excellent. It uses plain, simple language to explain the workings of money, finance, and the stock market. However, beore you run out and invest the farm based on what you read here, understand it is only an introduction.If there is a criticism of the book, it is that it is somewhat lightweight on financial advice, but then again,it is not a financial advice book. It is essentially an introduction and primer on how the stock market works. And that is all it should be used for as some of its discussions of what the ebbs and flows of the stock market mean are highly generalized.So, if you need to understand the jargon and obtain a grasp of how the markets work, start here. Just don't let this be your first and last read before you dive into the financial markets."
4,Investing for Dummies,I cant believe that I went through college without taking business or econ classes (except for political economy). This is a way for me to catch up.I like this book because it is easy to read and understand. So easy even an elementary school kid could understand....ok maybe junior high.Eventually I would hope to read the Intelligent Investor.
4,A good start,This was a good book for me to start with. The subject is presented very lightly and easliy to digest. I realized that there was a lot of things I did not know about finance/investing and this book gave me a general explanation of them. Definitely a good starter book for total beginners.
4,"Good Book, Loads of Information","This is an excellent book for beginners who want to learn about the Finance Industry and how money is minted and floated around. Now that the Finance Industry also have ETFs and several other new funds from what they had in the 90's it would be nice if the Author's wrote another edition of this book which includes all the latest information. But, in all this is an excellent read and the images and graphics make it more attractive to read."
5,Guide to Understanding Money & Investing,"It is a short comprehensive guide to us investment dummiesto understand the terms and functions of stocks,bonds, commodities etc.Looking to see if newer volumes have more info. This is a good start."
2,Disappointing--I didn't like any of these people,"Sly, conniving, unfaithful --I didn't sympathize or agree with any of the characters actions at all.Felix is apparently falling in love with Manuela Malliende & popping round to see her all the time despite being engaged to Sophia. And Manuela appeared to have set her cap for Felix too. Lord Manville, supposedly horribly disfigured but amazingly in perfect health takes advantage of all the tangled feelings so he can advance his own suit to Sophia - disgusting. And Sophia, finally learning of Felix's faithlessness, is caught in a passionate embrace with Lord Manville! So much for true love.I guess they all deserved each other in the end. No Beauty and the Beast story like I thought it might be with a wounded war hero. Other Rachelle Edward's books are wonderful -- this one disappointing and definitely not a keeper."
2,"Boring, skimmed through to the end","I haven't read any books by this author before, and would not be inclined to except that other books have better reviews. The book cover was misleading--the hero was wounded in battle but is totally healed so there isn't really a ""beauty and the beast""/wounded hero aspect to it. The author continually sprinkled in regency phrases like ""in a fidge,"" ""cry roast meat,"" etc. to the point that it annoyed me. The story was slow moving. I never grew to care for the characters, and I didn't see why any of them felt love for another. This went into the trash."
3,For the sale price - worth it.,"The cabinet is sturdy, functional, and a decent piece of furniture. There were two issues relating to finish and condition of the product. First condition - while it was well packed and the box had no visible signs of damage, there was a splinter of wood broken off the back edge and two areas where the finish was rubbed a little raw. Secondly, the top decorative edge on one side had what appeared to be an overuse of glue or putty and restained without properly sanding. Because the splintered piece was in the back where it wouldn't be seen, the two raw areas easily touched-up, and the top edge seam looked a bit like the older, distressed furniture surrounding this cabinet, it was not worth going through the hassle of a return. If not for these, it would be a five star."
3,Good enough but not stellar,"I was looking for something that looks nice but still had a nice drawer action. This didn't make it, yet. The cabinet was easy to put together. I don't have a power drill but it didn't matter. The problem is the top drawer will only open out three inches. It gets caught on something in the rail mechanism so I have requested a replacement piece. We will see if the new piece fixes the problem. As another owner reported, there is a gap between the top drawer and the bottom drawer, which, if I think about it too much, will really bother me.Received replacement tracks for the drawers and now there is a little hitch when the wheel in the drawer passes a screw that won't go flush. This is an improvement of getting completely stuck on the screw."
2,"Difficult Assembly, Poor Instructions","As others have noted, the use of high quality wood abounds. However, installing the 2 metal brackets--meant to provide stability to the entire structure--is an exercise in futility. The holes are too small and, due to their placement, there is no room left to maneuver. I gave up on them, which leaves me with a wiggly file cabinet that, while functional, inspires no confidence. Additionally, I could not get one of the cabinet pulls to thread all the way, so it's loose. Finally, the instructions were poorly written, forcing me on one occasion to backtrack (the drawer wheels were reversed)."
2,"Poorly made, but works - kinda.","I wanted a file cabinet that looked old to go with my antiques. This looked kinda old so I bought it.When it got here it arrived in a beat up box, the instructions were not the most clear.The screw that goes into the knobs on the front are too long and you have to force the screw in.The factory forgot to drill multiple holes, and made two holes WAY to big, making it impossible to assemble. I ended up having to use tie strips to hold it together.The bottom drawer does not fit and roll correctly, plus the drawers are crooked.I would return this, but I could never get it packaged back up. Look for other buying choices."
1,Very poor design,It is hard to square the other glowing reviews of this file cabinet with the one I received. My one has a patchy finish which makes the whole cabinet look old and cheap. The drawer sliding mechanism is primitive with the result that the motion is not at all smooth and the drawer almost falls out at the end of its travel. The resulting file cabinet is so bad it is barely useable.
2,What a Shame!,"The only reason that I gave the file cabinet two stars is because the person I spoke with at the company was very helpful. However, I received the product fast, but one piece was broken. I contacted the company and they were able to fairly rapidly sent out a replacement part. Only problem was that once I started putting the pieces together the pre-drilled holes were not aligned properly to allow the pieces to fit together. I would strongly recommend NOT purchasing this product until they have better quality controls in place. There are several other reviews with the same complaint. I usually take reviews with a grain of salt, and you should too, but this product is not made well. It is unfortunate because it is solid wood, it is very attractive, and seemed very sturdy (from what I could tell not being able to put it together.) I would have loved to have had this in my home office."
5,Perfect for Need,"Wonderfully crafted and heavy construction. All holes were precision cut. Instructions are a bit brief, but sufficient. All wood construction, except for back of drawers and back of cabinet, which are wood veneer in the same finish. Looks and performs like a product costing three times as much."
1,rails missing,"This file cabinet is sturdy and very good looking. My complaint is that it was missing two of the drawer rails. I now have to go to the hardware store and buy replacement rails and a drill because there are also no holes drilled. Or use a hammer and nail to make holes. Both a pain in the tush. It's so annoying when you're assembling furniture and there is a bit missing, a hole not drilled properly, or in this case a critical part of the mechanics is simply not where it should be. There was no way I was going to return the cabinet because it weighs more than me and repacking it would be a nightmare."
4,Looks Great,Looks great. I think a good deal for the price compared to what I saw at the furniture store when I was shopping around. It is sturdy enough for filing.
1,Not very effective,"I was looking for something that would really help enforce my posture, but this was pretty uncomfortable and not very effective. The arm wraps were scratchy again the skin and it didn't do much to help push your back into a neutral position. You are more aware of staying straight, but only because it's there; not because it works.Very disappointed...."
5,JADE COCOON COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"By far, JC is the best Playstation game I have ever played. It is my personal favorite game. I am completely in love with the Eternal Corridor. After you have beaten the game, it is accessable to you. It features all new minions that aren't featured in the original game. The storyline is OK, but where this game really shines is the graphics. This game is quite possibly the most detailed playstation game out there graphicwise. The only thing that can match it is probably the Spyro series. As you may know, the greatest feature in gameplay is the ability to merge minions into your own creations. I have one minion with the frame of a bird minion, but the skin of a turtle. It has a lot of the status ailment special attacks. Jade Cocoon is the best playstation game I have ever experienced."
3,persona revisited,"The graphics were great, but the plot was thin and the game to easy to beat. Reminded me of a higher quality version of the Playstation game Persona, but with better creature creation."
4,A Spiritual RPG,"I liked being a Cocoon Master. I liked hearing old legends told by the voice of the old wise man. And I liked a RPG who deals with respect for environment. When I accidentally slayed some minions I really felt sorry. And I had a lot of fun merging those funny little beasts. Buy it, if you are tired of the usal 'fight the evil one' RPG."
4,An inventive Twist for saving space on a disk,"The best part is the price. The game play was interesting and entertaining. Good intro graphics and sound manipulation, especially in a one disk game, which did not sacrifice game play to make attractive. The game saved space and research by re-using several of the dungons but with different color schemes and monsters. It took me aprox. 17 hrs to beat, at a leasurly pace, and I considerd it well worth the amount I paid for it retail."
3,"bleh, spiced up pokemon clone","meh, this game isn't too great as far as RPGs go, just about average. Just really a dressed up Pokemon, and when ure playing a system featuring games like Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy IX and Breath of Fire 4, this is very inferior. Really just for the fans..."
2,REPETITIVE,"At first the graphics and the whole monster transforming idea was quite intriguing... Unfortunately, every other level looked the same, too many of the monsters were too similar. The plot had little effect on your decision making and the whole psuedo spiritual theme was annoying. I beat the game in three days, and I haven't picked it up since then. You'd be better off renting it."
4,"This is a Great game for Role player, who seek adventure...","Great game and for half the price the game can be your's. I enjoyed it. Now when you play it, it's like FF VIII with all of the people. Enjoy and have fun"
3,It rules! At first at least.....,"I saw a video demo of this in my OPM Mag and was blown away! So, Almost a year after, I bought it..., I played it 3 hours straight....and beat it...The game is super-short, but its like Pokemon without all the little cute cuddly thingy's. Buy it if you kinda like Pokemon, but the game is WAY too short. Graphics are good, but i really do wish it would be longer, but it gets boring and repetitive after a while....Catch Minion....fight minions....build up minions.....catch minions....etc."
1,"I haven't seen a movie this bad since Manos ""The Hands of Fate""","Everyone that rated this movie a 5 owes me a few pennies and a small fraction of my life back.I like a good B-Rate movie now and then, but this title offered only faintest bit of humor to keep me watching. The acting was beyond bad, even for a B-rate title. Just a bad, bad movie."
2,Positively horrible....,...and that is what makes it a true b-movie....and memeber of MST3K working on the movie pre MST3K...WONDERFUL!
3,"Funny, Wisconsin humor",Being from Wisconsin this movie horror comedy is really funny. It was filmed in Hayward Wi and originally titled MUSKIE MADNESS. There are plenty of humorous digs about those Flatlanders from Illinois. We cheeseheads would understand. I plan on buying this movie. I had no idea anyone still had it available.
1,A Must-Have-NOT for wood-stove virgins!,"This book concentrates on how to purchase a wood stove, the differences found among brands. We recently purchased a home that had an existing wood stove. I had never even lived in a home with a fireplace. I was looking for a book to direct me in how to start a fire, how to put out a fire if necessary, what to do if ""something goes wrong"", and how to maintain the fire once started, etc., this book gave me none of this. It had two pages on the topic of starting a fire. Wood-stoves are very dangerous things and I feel that this, or any book on the subject should address the dangers and these concerns.I warn against buying this book. Don't waste your money!"
3,The Ultimate Halloween book this is not!,"Any book that bills itself the ""Ultimate"" had better be at least very good. This book doesn't fit the bill. A beautiful book, but the contents are reworked ideas most crafters have seen before. You'll get more bang for your buck buying a Halloween crafting magazine. Most projects are much too difficult for kids. Cute food ideas."
2,Beautiful to look at- Impractical to work,"The title sounded like it was going to be the most, ultimate, wonderful book. And at first blush it is colorful and seemed great. But then when I really sat and poured through it I figured out what is missing. Halloween is a one night event, albeit, one of the most fun for kids and adults alike. However, many of the patterns were for things that would take way too long to make, if you even knew how to crochet- which I do. I just wouldn't take the time to make something that took that long for a one night event. If you want to totally sew and craft and decorate your yard there are some good ideas, and there are some cute plans for getting a bit creative with your pumpkin. The recipes were just so-so, but the jack-o-lantern pancakes was a cute idea. The costume ideas were supposed to be easy, but were a little time consuming, so I only gave this book 2 stars."
1,A little better than the yellow version,"This library is not the best investment. Not only can this be found at reduced cost elsewhere, a significant portion of the content of this release is public domain. At the very least I would recommendPC Study Bible Version 5 Reference Library Plus. The BibleSoft website has good literature comparing the differences between libraries.As a PC Study Bible users since version 3.0 I currently consider this software to be ABANDONWARE. While they continue to add books for sale to the library, I would not recommend this product until new development is forthcomming. Though I do not use it, the BibleSoft user community currently recommends Logos (most major operating systems / devices supported, followLogos Bible Software)"
4,An obscure Tipico/Son Montuno/Conjunto album well worth getting.,"This obscure album which was issued by SAR Records (presumably) at some point during the 1980s is credited to Monte Adentro (the conjunto that backed up the Peruvian sonero Melcochita on his 1970s and '80s albums) and is a gorgeous set of classic Cuban music-inspired jams. Interestingly enough, most of these songs are not as long as one would have expected but there's not one weak track here. Melcochita himself is featured as lead singer on several tunes and his improvisations are witty, lightning-fast and at times utterly hillarious. As is the case with most other SAR CD reissues, virtually no information is given about the musicians, recording sessions or anything else but (on the plus side) the sound quality is quite good. NOTE: This CD reissue lists the release year as 1994 but I truly doubt it was released then."
3,Broken on arrival -- replaced within 2 weeks,"The first dispenser that I received arrived broken. The box did not contain any packing materials and the plastic broke in the corner of the dispenser. After contacting the seller and speaking with UPS, I got a replacement after 2 weeks. The replacement had no issues. The device altogether is very light, so if you don't want someone to walk off with it, it's best to mount it to something.Positives: reasonably cheap and works. The mechanical construction is simple and I would expect it to last many years.Negatives: getting the money out of the dispenser is a bit tricky. The way it is constructed is that the key acts as a screwdriver when inserted and unscrews the top of the dispenser. Once the top is removed, the plastic container can be lifted and the quarters are stored underneath it. I wish the design was not as clumsy."
4,All-Around Good Harness,"This harness is great; it's comfortable, functional, and looks good. The leg loops easily fit most legs, although if you have particularly large or small legs, you may want a different harness. The plastic gear loops are great because they keep your gear in place without a lot of sliding around while you climb, and they're strong enough to hold all of the quickdraws, pro, Nalgenes, and other junk you'll be clipping onto them.Two drawbacks:First, if you plan on wearing this harness for more than a few hours, (i.e. if you work in a climbing harness, like I do, or you just think it looks cool) you might want something with more padding.Second, the leg loops aren't the best when it comes to adjustments.Still, this harness is a great harness, and I would (and did, to my roommate) recommend it."
1,Wow...,It never fails to surprise me that S Club 7 can deceive so many credulous listeners... This overplayed bubblegum pop song simply is unlistenable...
4,Great but might not work for everyone,"This is a nice video cable, especially for the price. As some others have reported, the incorporated audio cable isn't long, maybe 12"". I bought it to use my 42"" TV as a display for my laptop. I was able to hook up both audio & video at the TV since the inputs are right next to each other. However, on my laptop the VGA connector is on the back and headphone port is on the side, so I can't make both connections on the laptop because the audio cable is too short. Another 3""-4"" would have made all the difference. As a solution, I'll order an audio cable extension, with one end male & the other female. That will give me way more than enough extra reach on the audio cable."
5,Great VGA Cable 2 in 1,This is a great product at a great price and accomplishes two things in one. Because VGA only carries video the accompaning 3.5mm audio jack allows sound to be connected to your output device as well. This is very convenient. The cable is also very thick and durable. I originally bought this to hook up my old desktop pc to my HDTV however I failed to measure correctly and the cable was too short. I was going to return it but decided I keep this cable as a backup and use it for my netbook/notebook when necessary. You will not find a better product at a better price at any of the retail stores. Good buy in my opinion.
4,HD15 (SVGA) Cable with 3.5 Stereo Audio Cable,"I do a lot of computer system re-configurations, and this cable has worked for all my configurations, the Audio cable works great for those monitors that have built in speakers. The Thumb screws are easy to use and access. I have had installations where the cable was mixed and laying with AC cables... And no RFI or EMI effects were seen on te monitor. or in the audio stream."
3,Not as described,"When i got this cable in the mail i was supprised to find out ther was no 3.5 stero male connector with the package, just the vga cab cable. The cable worked gread and seemed good quality. This product my be mislabled or they sent me the wrong package. Either way before you order contact seller to make sure the product is adveretised corrrectly."
1,"Missing pins, won't support HD resolutions","Construction on this cable is just ok - the screws on the connector are not well aligned. You may notice that the cable is a bit thinner than you have usually seen for a VGA cable. There's a reason for this - this cable is missing a pin and some of the pins that are present are not connected.Pins 4, 5, and 15 are present in the connector, but not connected. Pin 9 is missing altogether. Pin 9 and 15 are critical to the VESA DDC2 monitor communication protocol. Without these, you won't be able to achieve decent resolutions (I couldn't get more than 1024x768).In short, if you want to do HD, look elsewhere."
1,"Great Video - Works as described, HOWEVER. the audio portion provides HORRIBLE interference","The cable is of great construction as mention by others. However, I do not use the audio portion of the cable because I have a separate cable that plugs into my speakers. The second I touch the VGA part of the cable to my laptop and insanely annoying and horrible interference sound on the speakers can be heard. When the cable stops touching, sound is back to normal.EDIT: CABLE HAS NOW STARTED TO BREAK DOWN! When moved the color is drastically changed from normal to a dark greenish color. It is definitely a problem with the cable as the connection part is completely fine (no pins messed up) July 22UPDATE 2: Completely broken, blues/yellows/etc fade in and out when cable is jostled just a little bit. Practically impossible to get perfect balance anymore. August 1. This cable is shot. Horrible excuse for a VGA cable."
4,I used to highlight my hair a lot ...,I used to highlight my hair a lot when I was younger so I was happy to be able to Test Drive this product. I have to say that I really liked knowing that I didn't have to use a plastic hat. It was so much easier to just paint the cream on the hair itself. The color was great and the product was easy to use. I've already told my sister about it!
5,Kate's Secret Plan - GREAT BOOK,I love horse books and this is one of my favorites. I liked it because it showed how you can do whatever you want to do even if you are a girl. Girls can do equally as well as boys when they put their mind to something. I like it when people do what they want by putting their mind to accomplish something. Kate showed her courage in this book. It is also fun to read and you can learn a lot about quarter horse
3,Only okay.,"This new book in the Treasured Horses series was not one of my favorites. It was set in Canada in 1926. It was about a girl who wants to compete in the cattle cutting contest at the fair with her horse, Chinook. But the contest is only for boys. The ending was way too perfect and neat. Overall, I was very dissapointed by this book."
3,A good start; somewhat helpful; you'll need more,"This is a very short, easy book that will get you started in reading faster. I am well educated but an exceedingly slow reader (195 wpm). After I read this book I was reading much, much faster. But, the book is somewhat deceiving. It requests the reader to adopt its methods while reading the book, but the later chapters become very repetitive and include little in the way of challenging vocabulary. So, the book unfairly inflates your speed increase.I later purchased Kump's Breakthrough Rapid Reading which is more thorough, includes drills and assignments for reading material other than the text provided. I would recommend Kump's book as a follow-on."
2,I found NO 7-DAY Program! Just wave your hand & read faster?,"The book is clearly geared toward students. You learn early on how many words-per-minute you read and then you learn some of the hand motions used to push yourself to read faster. The ""practice makes perfect"" philosophy is endorsed.There's a section on how to write term papers, faster. I got my degree in the sciences a couple decades ago so this was of minimal interest to me.Basically, I learned that if you push yourself to read faster, you'll increase your reading speed."
3,Remember everything you read,I didn't really like this book because it made you feel like you had to read really fast on everything! Not true!
3,Speed reading and learning Program,"In the beginning of the book explain the first step, use your index finger to underline sentence as you read.In which I tried to keep up with my finger. That cause me to read faster and then I started picturing the text as I read the book. I might have to read it again to really complish my goal or better yet comprehend it fully."
2,Unhelpful,"I found this book pretty dismal. It may be somewhat helpful for people who read very slowly because they mentally pronounce each word, but I doubt it will be much use to those who want to improve an above average speed.The book starts with the exciting claim that speed can be improved by up to 50% just by using the most basic underlining motion. My speed increased from 400 words per minute to 480, which I regard as no improvement at all given that one of the rules is not to back up and re-read anything. Obviously you can read faster if you hold yourself to a lower level of comprehension!The author then introduces a series of complicated hand motion diagrams. When following those motions, I retained only the vaguest impressions of the material.Most of the book is only tangentially related to speedreading. It's padded with success stories, commonsense advice about study skills, and a chapter about a mind-boggling system of diagrammatic note-taking."
3,Helped a little,"Decent book on the techniques used to achieve faster reading rates. Aside from underlining hand movements and just plain common sense things there was some substance in here. When we read it's natural to sound the words in our heads. True speed reading aims to bypass the auditory section of the brain. By keeping your vocal chord busy, by talking or humming, you can achieve this with some practice and dramatically improve your speed."
3,"Good, but only 1/2 the story.","This book carefully tells the reader how to do the first method of speed reading called ""Sub-Vocal"" reading: Using your hand to underline the line you are reading. That part is great. I increased my speed from 233wpm to about 350wpm on my very first attempt. It really helped me focus.But the the next method to really do fast reading (Upwards of 1500wpm), well, it left me a bit flat. The method involves ""vertical reading"", and also gives some tips on other hand movements that help speed things along. I understand the concept. But I think the book could have gone into much more depth about how to be successful using this method.Admittedly, I was trying to do this on a commuter train while attempting this. Not the best of environments. I will try again, however.Also, I'll be reading the ""Photoreading Whole Mind System"" next."
4,Very good introductory book,"This book is quick and to the point, but it lacks depth. Dr. Frank goes through the basics of the Evelyn Wood method (basic hand motions and read-training exercises) in a concise manner. You'll get great pointers on how to increase your reading speed and comprehension, as well as how to study in the most efficient manner.Overall it is a great book to introduce one to speed reading."
1,Don't buy this garbage,"The only semi-useful text in this book was the beginning chapters where the underlining method was described. It added about 100wpm to my current speed, but requires you to have your hand involved in reading AT ALL TIMES. Totally worthless.I am currently reading/studying Wade E Cutler's 1988 Edition of Triple Your Reading Speed. This is quality speedreading material."
4,"It does work, if your willing to put in the effort","The techniques shown in this book as well as the effort you put in to using them. There are alot of success stories, but they are motivating and, well, it's the perfect way to practice what you are taught! I liked it."
1,Infomercial,"This book reads like an infomercial. There is very limited practical advice, but plenty of long descriptive stories about people who have benefited from the live course taught using the method described in the book. General principles are stated--such as Don't Pronounce Words, but we are not really told how to go from sounding words to simply seeing them."
3,"Whets your appetite, but it's not enough","The book was excellent in the sense that it gives you an appetite for developing speed-reading skills, but it doesn't take you very far. For example, why does the title have `7-Day' in it? Other than claiming that it will double your reading speed in a week, it has nothing to do with 7 days. One would think from the title that the book is setup as a set of exercises - one for each day. Anyhow, in favour of the book - it did increase my reading speed by more than 50% almost immediately after starting it, which is what it claimed it would do. However, there are only 3 speed-reading drills in the book - I had hoped for more testing and practice drills. If you want an intro to speed reading, study skills, and test taking - buy this book. It goes into academic skills quite a bit. However, if you're looking for a book solely on speed-reading, consider another one."
3,Helpful,"This book has given me tips to improve my reading-speed, and I have improved it to some degree. But to get best the sub-vocalizing, so that I just absorb the words like a computer-scanner and read REALLY fast seems impossible to me! I hope I'll be able to get to that level, but....And, since it is required in the technique recommended, that you scan the words with your fingers, I wonder if such a method will be useless, with the advent of so much material being read on the internet. It's not quite the same scanning your fingers under words on a computer screen, as it is a book! I'd be interested to see if how-to-read-fast on computer screens is addressed in future editions."
1,Forget This Book,"If you're looking for a well organized and effective tool to increase your reading speed, you're better off trying Tony Buzan's Speed Reading book. You should come across some useful suggestions every now and then, but most of the time, the book is just blah. But I suppose that's what you have to expect from a book promising to 'open the door to new realms of intellectual power and potential success.'"
2,Book-sized Infomercial,"Maybe fourty percent of this book is devoted to the ""success stories"" of Evelyn Wood students (who took the program, not read the book) without teaching reading methods. These stories can be quite belittling as they show the incredible (perhaps incredulous) results of EV students.The actual methods contained in this book are inflexible and outdated. The slash-memory system ,is a good example, because it is hard to use and limiting. Try mind-mapping instead. As for speed-reading, I have yet to find a book that lives up to its promises ...(I'm willing to take recommendations ;)"
1,Speed Reading or Sales Pitch,"The book does have some good techniques ,but about half the book is made up of success stories of the EV system. The book just barely describes how to read vertically and the same goes for block reading. Other then that the book is basically an advertisement for the EV system. Don't buy this book!"
2,Enter At Your Own Risk,"Before buying this album heed this warning. What this album is NOT...An album full of heavy, sludgy doom/metal like ISIS. What this album is...A soundtrack for a sojourn through the dark recesses of your mind.I bought this album because I saw that it was a side project of Aaron Turner, frontman for ISIS, expecting something heavy. There is barely any music on this CD, it is mostly swirling and fading effects with a random slathering of guitar or bass. I would not even venture to call this music, more like an experiment with sound effects for those heavily dosed on hallucinogens.For what it is, this is interesting...but NOT something you can casually listen to EVER."
2,Stilted and repetitive writing. Pass this one by.,"I am a big fan of fantasy and romance. My favorite thing about both these genres is the nice escape from everyday life they usually provide. This book did more to annoy me than relax me. Editing (if there was any) was an obvious failure - in an exchange between two main characters, one uses the other's name immediately after she's refused to tell him her name. The prose style is belabored and switches between ""fantasy"" and modern style intermittently. Characters are hollow despite the repetition of supposedly meaningful backstory. The author uses the same expressions over and over again, especially during sex scenes. Dialogue feels inauthentic and is ultimately unconvincing. A very unsatisfying read."
5,Seasons of Pleasure: Summer and Autumn,Great BOOKS! I can't wait until the next book in this series is released in Print!
5,Terrasson of the better times,Here Jacky Terrasson plays a Steinway and thus all the subtleties of his playing come out. The ensemble is tight and it's a balanced album with even more energy than his first blue note release that came few years later.
2,Ordered 2 of them. Neither worked.,"Left my original charger in a hotel. Could not recover. Old model cell phone, and no local stores carried my model charger any longer. So happy to have found model on Amazon. Ordered 2...just in case I lost one again. They arrived promptly...nicely packaged.BUT, neither worked. Cheap imatations. Experience made me feel like a sucker.Found another source on the Internet, and bought one there. Arrived OK...and it works!Bad Experience Here. BUYER BEWARE."
1,Please don't buy this,"Ok look, I read a few bad reviews on here and bought this anyway because I was desperate and thought it would work well enough. It honestly doesn't. So don't waste your time buying this when it's a sure bet that it won't work. All it does is light up my screen over and over again, bouncing back and forth from ""Charging Battery"" to ""No Charger"", which actually ends up draining my battery even more than it would if I just let it sit there. Just don't do it."
1,It doesn't work for the U540. A worthless purchase.,This charger just does not work on the phone it is supposed to work for. DOn't waste your money.Martin S.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I though i got the best deal EVER when i was able to purchase this item at $ .01... Well After the first 2 uses, i realized just why it was practically given away! Too bad i lost out on the shipping costs...."
2,Took a shot,"This charger does not work that well. My phone flashes and blinks when it is plugged in, and charges to one bar at best. My 3rd party car charger still works normally so I think this one was a bust...update: seller sent me a replacement, A for service. replacement charger is slightly better. worth the dollar if you're in a jam"
4,Lordy! This is tough but good :-),"If you want a good workout - you got it with this. This is tough and challenging but WILL give you results for sure.There are three super challenging workouts here and each targets specific body area using heavier weights than normal, but slow repetitive movements. This is done to really fatigue the muscles and make them work harder. You aren't using momentum but instead concentrating on intensity and that's how you get the results. There is a Legs and Shoulders workout, a Triceps and Biceps one and a Chest and Back. There is no way possible you won't get results if you do this often. It is tough but it's worth it and worth every penny spent. She is an outgoing and motivating instructor and you are bound to love this dvd."
5,"Japan, Iron Butterfly and the Temptatons!",All in a row and it works really well... Very interesting combinations but moves and grooves... Super Choice!!! The GU Miami was great and this may actually be better...
1,An Important FYI...,"Just in case you missed the fine print (as I did) this is the UNMIXED version. That is, the tracks are not blended together as in usual DJ mixes. They are standalone, and separate.The page notes this at the very bottom of the text description. It's very easy to miss if you're not paying attention.1-star just to make sure that it's clear. Otherwise Danny Howells is an incredible dj. One of the best in the world. And this is a great CD. The mixed version is also available elsewhere on the site, with an interview DVD."
2,"No ""Tiffany Glass"" in this product","I think the item title, ""Black Tiffany Glass Path Light"", is incorrect. I purchased this item at $19.99 and what I received looked like PL-931650-WBO but in a black finish. There was no ""Tiffany Glass"" in this product. They are well built, and may be worth their current price, but they certainly did not meet my expectations."
2,"Poorly written, brilliant analysis","Poorly written, brilliant analysis. To bad the publisher didn't hire an editor to clean up his grammar and sentence structure. Lots of double negatives, double and triple qualifiers and sentences without an easily identifiable subject. Over all it is worth the effort, strictly for the history. I would hate to take a class from him."
2,Poorly written but worth the effort,"Poorly written, brilliant analysis. To bad the publisher didn't hire an editor to clean up his grammar and sentence structure. Lots of double negatives, double and triple qualifiers and sentences without an easily identifiable subject. Over all it is worth the effort, strictly for the history. I would hate to take a class from him."
3,Folly,This effort would have been better in a shortened form as an article in a serious magazine. The book reads much like notes from a university lecture series that have been rushed to print to capture the public's current interest in Iraq. Nonetheless it will be of use to those who desire some political background on how modern Iraq was formed in the post-World War I era and why the decisions made then still reverberate today.
1,not worth the paper it is printed on,"I did not like the book, which is fundamentally flawed from the concept and proposition. Sorry to have wasted my time going through it."
5,Barbara Apoian,This book should have been required reading before we attacked Iraq. It demonstrates how a lack of historical research can result in repeating the same mistakes. It is extremely well written and brings reality to the many false myths that led to the division of the spoils and the creation of present-day Iraq. I recommend it to all readers who really want to know the de-mythologized account of what happened after World War One.
2,Cotton Gloves - white,Much too small; and no larger size was listed on this website. The fabric is OK but the fingers are much too short.
4,"Basic item, doing their job","I bought these gloves because of dry skin on my hand and I wanted to give that hand extra protection. You get 12 pair, but there are no true left or rights; all 24 single gloves fit on either hand. This was a big advantage for me because I only use them on one hand. Don't expect them to last forever. About a quarter of them started to unravel after the first use. Others have been through the washer a few times and are still holding up.Since this review, I did try another company's gloves. They were similar except they were a little less expensive, but more importantly, they were bigger. This means they fit over my hand more easily and were less likely to split at the seam. For neither company did I see a size listing in the product description. I normally wear a large, male glove size. If you have small hands this company might be your best bet. If your hands are bigger, you might want to look at the other company I reviewed."
4,"They work, with a few comments",They are suitable for cosmetic use. It would be better if the fingers were not so narrow and long and the wrists were hemmed.
1,Too big & thin,"I used to get cotton gloves at Body Shop to heal my dry hands at night. Body Shop does not carry these gloves anymore, so I bought the gloves from Amazon.com. They are too big and do not fit my hands well. I also found that they are thin and not made of good material. Quite disappointed."
1,Worst gloves ever!,"The seller shipped quickly and did describe the gloves so I don't want to give him a bad review. However, these gloves were the worst! I compare them to ""Cara"" brand I purchased before AND after these gloves. These are VERY thin and even size large barely fit to my woman's med. size hand's wrist. Then I washed them and they literally fell apart and shrunk so much I threw them away.I need gloves that can be washed and stretched back to shape while laying flat to dry.(Don't put in dryer!) I also need the gloves to last for awhile. Of course, eventually all gloves of this type need replacement. Please don't waste your money-this is not a good deal. I recommend Cara brand, which are hemmed. Wash & dry as I said and they won't shrink and will last through many, many washings."
1,Did Not Work For Me,"Not satisfied with product, they were very, very thin and did not hold up at all. They smelled like a machine shop - washed them and they fell apart."
5,Best Of Beyond Real,"For people who like hip-hop from the ""indy-age"", this is a great pick-up. Listening to this makes you wonder how rap changed to the garbage that is out now...."
5,Just a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down...,"In a few words, that is how I experienced this book. The medicine Dr. Habib presented was honest and truthful, thoughts about life and love; yet the way he delivered it was with sugar, fun and practical. I appreciated his openness and desire to share his experiences in an approachable manner. Even though I am not yet married nor do I have children, I enjoyed the sections on these topics as they gave me some ""heads up"" things to consider. This is an enjoyable and awakening read!"
5,"Excellent book, for layman or professional",I was impressed with the depth and insight this author has and found the book extremely well-organized and thought out.Each story has a different problem or a different angle on a problem so there is plenty of material that any of us can identify with and find useful. I liked the fact that it omitted a lot of technical talk yet was specific enough about the sessions that the reader got a clear picture of Habib's therapy and his approach.
5,Love It,I have so many brushes its ridiculous but now that I have this one i dont need any other brushe. Im very happy with this brush. i highly recommend it.
5,Best brush I have ever had,"I cant say enough how happy i am about this brush, I love love love it. If you want a brush to last and give your a nice feeling on every stroke of the way, this is it."
1,not consistent with reputation or cost,"This brush helps detangle, but the part with the bristles keeps sliding off the part with the handle. Therefore money down the drain. I am so angry because it took a lot for me to buy a brush at that price."
2,Something has changed.,The bristles on this brush are much sharper than an older model we have. Hard to comfortably brush.
5,Love This Brush!,"I have thick hair, so this brush is perfect for me. The 9 row Denman brush has a strong handle and is a much heavier brush then other brushes that look similar. I've used knock-off brands of this brush before, but the knock-offs aren't made as well - I either break the handle while brushing through my hair or the rubber part of the brush comes apart. The Denman brand holds up very well to daily use with a hair dryer and always last for years. The plastic bristles are kind of sharp to start with but it's only noticeable the first week or so. This brush slips through wet tangled hair faster than a comb, without causing damage. Everything about this brush is made for thick hair, be it short or long, curly or straight. If you have thin hair, you don't need this brush, it's way too much brush for thin hair. The price of $13.48 on Amazon is good, I paid $17 + tax from a beauty supply store at the mall."
5,Excellent For Curly Hair,"This brush is designed for thick, long or medium length hair. When I was naturally curly I used this brush all the time to smooth and shape my hair into perfect curls. The trick is to put conditioner or gel onto wet/damp hair and to section it off before you use the Denman brush. Since you're brushing your hair while it's wet, it's important to take your time using the brush. Also, the brush does well with straightening your hair while you blow dry. I never had any problems with my hair being tangled in the brush. As for durability, it depends on where and how frequently you use it. If you use it in the shower, the pink rubber will loosen, making the pins appear shorter and therefore less effective. I've been using the Denman brush for 6 years and it's the only brush I'll use for my hair."
5,I have used the Denman 9 row brushes for 30+ years,"Eventually the red rubber part comes apart but it does take many, many years to do it. The first one I bought in London - maybe at Sassoons (?) - and I've been hooked ever since. When the first one wore out, we didn't have the internet then so I had to really do some searching and then I ordered four but two were immediately confiscated by my teenaged son who also has long, very thick hair. My Mom (same hair) also took one. Now we have wonderful Amazon and the net where you can find anything and today I am ordering two more. I LOVE these brushes. They feel good, they work wonderfully! I think I've used this type of Denman brush almost 40 years as I think I bought that first one in 1972..."
2,wrong for me -- very heavy in weight,"This brush is quite heavy and would be great for thick-ish, long hair since the hair does tend to stay smoothed down once brushed with this. Maybe even for a man with thick wavy hair (this will be a great gift to someone like this that I have in mind)."
4,Pleasantly suprised,I read many reviews about this brush prior to purchasing. I have spent tons of money on other brushes that just ended up pulling my hair out after 6 months of use. I am so glad I purchased this. I bought one for me and my daughter and she loves it as well!
3,"Mediocre, at best","This is a weak product, possibly because it tries to do too much. It will supposedly open and close jars; however, the design that makes this dual use possible compromises its effectiveness. It is very awkward to use even for me, and I have good vision, am not elderly, and do not have arthritis. If your main goal is to open jars, try something else. There are many open-only products that excel. If you are in any way handicapped, this product will prove frustrating."
5,"Very well made, heavy gauge steel, not a bit of plastic.","Very well made, heavy gauge steel, not a bit of plastic. Should literally last a lifetime. The kind of thing you will unscrew and take with you if you move. The chrome is very nice, not cheap sprayed-on type. It has ridges for both opening and sealing jars, a bonus they don't advertise(but should). And it's the same price as molded plastic openers that maybe will last 1 or 2 years."
3,not like i remembered,I grew up in a home that had an opener under the cabinet...but it worked so much better--this one is okay...but it just doesn't work as well as I remembered.
2,jar opener,"Conceptually, it is a good idea; however, ""gripping device"" should be wider. One has to "" eyeball"" the jar for proper positioning there is no guide that naturally positions the lid. Since it is an under counter device it is awkward to use. A friend has a different model that works splendidly."
5,The full picture,"At last an entertaining and vivid picture of the history of Miami University, one of the oldest universities in the US. Not only does Prof. Shriver delve into the fascinating history of Miami, but he gives us the big picture by providing an overview of where and why colleges were formed."
4,A Revered Miamian. An Interesting Book,"This informative book on Miami University is by no means a prolific body of literature, but merely relays factual information about the history of the university and important events. I would definitely recommend and encourage anyone interested in attending/working at Miami to read this book as it will give the reader a good impression of what the school is like."
4,"Short, Harrowing -- Still Plenty Good Enough","This remarkable short novel sat in the author's files for years before it was published, as Fugard wondered if it was good enough. It recently gained attention as the film adaptation won the 2005 Academy Award for best foreign language film. Like Rohinton Mistry, Fugard focuses on the underclass in his adopted home of South Africa, but unlike Mistry, the boundaries of his world stop there. Violence, redemption and fate all take turns in this story of a young thug's rediscovery of his past and development of his future. A harrowing, yet somehow very satisfying read."
2,"Death Mask: Slasher Flick, Not Kung Fu","There seems to be some confusion among the Amazon reviews about this product. ""Death Mask"" is a low-budget horror film starring James Best (of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" TV show) as Wilbur, a socially awkward carnival geek who nurtures a frustrated love of women. Although he finds himself falling for Linnea Quigley, romantic feelings that are at least partly requited, Wilbur simultaneously becomes attached to a beautiful death mask that forces him (liberates him?) into becoming a killer. I can't say that I have an objective opinion about this film -- I'm not a fan of the genre and only picked it up because I went to high school with a cast member -- but it struck me that James Best had some real talent and I don't know whether to be impressed or saddened that he put so much of it into this sort of movie."
4,Mississippi Squirrel Revival,I wanna to replace it when I bought it on Cassette He thinks he's Ray Stevens.
2,"Starts Well, Then Goes Downhill","I had heard good things about this book and started with high hopes. The first third of the book was excellent, as you follow Mia and her family as their life as Jews in 1939 Poland slowly falls apart. The interlude in 1941 Brooklyn was OK, but then Mia returns to Europe as a spy/Resistance fighter and I felt it was totally unbelievable. The war seemed to be nothing more than background noise for Mia's sexual escapades. She liked to talk about her passion for music, but the plotline revolved around her expertise with whips and chains and blubbering Nazi SS officers.Very disappointing, overall."
1,Factually incorrect,"The infamous concentration camp, Treblinka, did not come into existence until 1942. The resultant plot is predicated on it being in existence in 1940 which changes what happens to the characters. Whether this was done deliberately or totally in ignorance, does not look good for the author and researchers involved in authenticating major facts. There are such silly and juvenile scenes; such as a letter sent to daughter Mia from her father while in Treblinka asking for blankets and pillows, a French boyfriend unexpectedly found in his luxurious Paris apartment while Germans are tramping around and his dry cleaning is being delivered. Skip to 1941 Brooklyn and our heroine falls in love with an Italian clarinetist, then Pearl Harbor, her rejoining an allied group to go to France and help the cause, her subsequent adventures as lady of ill repute at a brothel and so on. It's been a long time since I have read anything as shallow as this and I hope it is the author's last try."
5,Software Requirements,Writer is great! Very good explanations. Book received quickly and in perfect shape. I recommend the seller.
4,A good complement to Software Requirements book,"This book is easier to read than the book that it is the sequel to and has specific topics. They may or may not add value to your life, but does add value to the original book to get a little more insight into how real life works on software projects."
4,Good Book On Requirements,"This book addresses specific topics related with software requirements and the section ""10 cosmic truths about software requirements"" alone is well worth the read. The definitive book on software requirements remains the ""Software Requirements"" by the same author."
4,Very practical book - good advice,This is an excellent book which discusses the practical aspects of requirements engineering. Is a good companion to the original Weigers book.
4,A new look at a very old and tragic behavior,"After learning that this book was ""required"" reading for the faculty at my daughter's school, I too wanted to read the book. This is a very poignant look at the life long effects of bullying. If you were the bullier or the one being bullied this is a ""must read"". I was so saddend to read about Frank Peretti's life as a child. What an encouragement to see how he overcame his childhood! The pain and scars from your childhood can be overcome."
1,Not original artists,"This is a great collection of songs, but it is done by the countdown singers not the original artists."
2,"Inexpensive lights, bad connectors.","I purchased a number of these lights last year to use on the face of a retaining wall. They installed easily and look good. However, after just 6 months, the ""fast lock connectors"" have completely corroded through on 3 of the lights. Unfortunately, this means digging up the buried line, finding the connector and re-doing it (I'm just cutting off the fast lock connector and splicing the wires together with waterproof wire nuts). I will probably just dig up all 47 lights and replace the connectors all at once before I lay down sod. Otherwise I will have to replace the lights one at a time over the next few years until they have all failed."
4,VERY GOOD ON PLASTIC SCRATCHES,"GOOD FOR REMOVING SCRATCHES FROM VINYL CD'S AND DVD'S. JUST DAB A LITTLE ON, SWIRL THE CLOTH GENTLY TO REMOVE SMALL SCRATCHES. THE DAMAGED CD OR DVD WILL NOW PLAY WITH LITTLE DIFFICULTY."
2,"Temp scratch solution, you have to keep repeating it","This did reduce the visibility of some scratches. Visibility is the key word. Most scratches are scratches in the clearcoat which mars it making it white, thus more visible. If you dab a little water on it, it will darken it and thus make less visible as well for a very short period of time. This is like that other than it will last longer, like days. The idea is to treat it then wax it then it will last as long as the wax.I only gave it two stars due to it's only a short temp solution you have to do repeatedly. That doesn't appeal to me in the least.As someone else said, this might be a good thing for CD/DVD scratches as it won't really wear off that fast."
5,this book touched my heart,"I seldom write reviews although I am an avid reader of a wide variety of books. This book, however is one which has inspired me and motivated me to make necessary changes in my life.Rabbi Gafni has the gift of making the stories of the Bible come to life. I have read or heard many of these stories before, but have never been able to relate to them in a way that actually touched me emotionally. I enjoyed the Soul Print Practice sections of the book particularly because they helped clarify areas of my life that needed healing and a perhaps a new perspective.This book is about living your truth, no matter what your religious background or beliefs."
2,Author Integrity?,"The austhor has a lot to contribute, but misses the mark by claiming two stories that are not his own. Two stories in this book come directly from Robert Fulgham. And while Fulgham describes them as generic stories, the author claims they happened to his family (one, his son and the other his wife). Considering the material of the book, it is very disappointing that the author describes them as original. One, could be considered a coincidence ot rare event, but not two. This was very disappointing."
5,"Love it, But Disappointed","I love this book with all my heart. I was very disappointed when I finished and did some research only to find there was no sequel following Seb, Charlie, Em, Cass and Lyd. Still, I love the book."
4,A Kick Arse Book,"I love this book! I couldn't put it down the whole time I was on the trip my class took to Washington D.C.! Even though in some parts it couldn't hold my attention it makes up for it with some great characters. I love Lydia's character. Mainly because some of the stuff she does and the things she say's made me burst out laughing on the plane. I loved how when you read more and more of it, it started to make a lot more since. Like when the (...) Never mind! You have to read it for yourself! This is a must have book for all!"
5,An awesome book!!!,"The Yr. of Secret Assignments is a great book! It's about 3 private school girls writing to 3 boys, who they cannot relate to at all. My favorite characters were Emily and Charlie. The ""Date with a Girl"" was really funny. Cassie was a little bit boring to me and Matthew was...read the book to find out! But in Cassie's and Matthew's letter exchanges, Matthew changes really suddenly. Lydia and Seb are fine, but you can't really tell what Lydia's really thinking and doing.I recommend this book to girls from the ages of 13-17. It was awesome and I could not put it down!!!"
4,Year of Secret Assignments Reveiw,"The Year of Secret Assignments is a very entertaining and funny book. When I first read it, I thought it was really weird but I as I read on, I began to like it. The characters are really interesting and made me not want to put it down. It's kind of an unusual book, the way it's written in letters to and from the characters and in the character's diaries and notebooks. But that makes it interesting and original and it helped me to keep reading. It's nice that the book is really funny but is also kind of sad. I don't really enjoy sad books, but the funniness helped. I also like how it was fast paced so the reader won't get bored. This book was a pleasure to read and very original. I give it a nine out of ten and I can't wait to read the sequel!-Louisa H."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This book was just absolutely amazing. It's made up of letters, notes, diaries, and emails. Two rival schools are doing a pen pal program. As you get further into the book, you see each person's relationship with their pen pal develop-or worsen. This book was very entertaining, but it does have some adult language. You should still read this book!!!!!"
4,Good book!,"This book starts out with 3 girls from Ashbury, a private school, and 3 boys from Brookfield, a public school filled with bad kids.Well, the 3 girls are supposed to be penpals with the 3 Brookfield boys, who are by the way a rival school, hated by all Ashbury students.The boys of Brookfield are Seb, Charlie, and Matthew Dunlop. Seb is a soccer loving artist, Charlie is a car theif and also a great guy with a great personality, and Matthew...well, Matthew is a jerk.The girls meet with the boys in person, and Lydia and Seb and Charlie and Emily (i think) go ""steady"", while Matthew and Cassie are not.1st the book is a romance getting to know each other...but later it turns into fights, locker raids, and even ""courts"""
3,Pretty Good,"this was a pretty good book. the way it was written made it intresting. i didnt like how it ended, it was like a sudden end. i would recommend this book if you enjoyed reading the sisterhood of the traveling pants. this book is similar to traveling pants."
2,Blah Blah Blah,"That's how I felt throughout this whole book. Blah blah blah. Sure there's a story there, but it takes so long to get to it!! There's way too much other junk going on that doesn't really matter...and when you finally do get to the story it's sort of depressing and mean. I don't really agree with the people who thot there was too much profanity and sex for the audience it's aimed at. I just thought it was pretty boring. I'm really glad I got it from the library. Don't waste your $$."
3,The year of secret assignments,"_the year of secret assignments_ by jaclyn moriarity is story about three friends Emily, Lydia, and Cassi. These three friends go to a school called Ashburey high and don't get along with brookfield high, the school across the street from their school. At school, their teacher Mr. botherit assignes them to penpals from brookfield to help them understand each other's diffrences.When Emily, Lydia and cassie get their penpals they are not happy at all, but as the year goes by they start to feel really strong about each other and end up going out with each other"
4,Fun Read,"I thought that this book was pretty good. I liked the letter, list, journal, etc. format a lot. I also liked the idea of the ""secret assignments.""I very much enjoyed reading the letters between the 6 students of Ashbury high and Brookfield High. I thought the letters were hilarious and fun to read. The only boring part was reading Cassie's diary. I had to try very hard to keep reading that part.Well, all in all, this is a fun read and its well worth the time."
2,Not Finished,"I'm on chapter 5 and I'm thinking of giving up on it. The one girl Cassie is SO annoying she reminds me of an escapee of an insane assylum, I don't blame Matthew for wanting to rip her eyes out! The only part I'm interested in is Emily and Charlie.I can believe I bought that book I should've eithera) borrowed it from the library (or my friend)orb) just not have read it."
2,Bored me.,I bought this book thinking it would be good. The characters are hard to realte to and it moves back and forth so quickly you dont know what is happening. It just bored me even though i finished it and the ending was terrible.I dont recommend it
1,Unexpected,"Well, I should have listened to the majority of the reviews posted on Amazon about this book. It was terrible. To me, the worst parts were the terrible language and explicit descriptions of sexual encounters. The sex was unexpected; this is supposedly a suspense book, so sex isn't really needed. But beyond the offensive content, the book just wasn't written well. The story never really grabs your attention, and the characters are dry and stereotypical. To conclude, take the advice of most reviewers and skip this book. O'Reilly's a smart man, but he needs to stick with news and leave fiction to the experts!"
1,Novel from a lying journalist? hmm...,"I got this book as a gift. First of all, I was curious whether the author is that Bill O'Reilly (It was). This was indeed the worst fiction of all time, tied with ""the Campaign"" by M.T.Quayle, et al.Indeed, it was so bad that I recycled the gift at the first chance.At least this time ""O'Really"" have an excuse to lie this time. If I had to draw a conclusion from this novel, I'd say that the murderer 's character is actually based on Billy boy himself."
1,"Poor Billy Boy, you are a sorry soul!","Good grief! I think ol' Bill forgot that he wrote this pathetic excuse for prose. The book writes more like the porno films he must have watched so he could fantasize about what to write.And after his criticisms of the 2013 Super Bowl commercials, he must have forgotten to take his ""MEMORY"" PILLS, having written this book.Bill O'Reilly is a cynical, miserable, lonely, insecure, groveling, whining & whimpering, impatient, wretched, second-rate, pathetic, despicable, depressed, and finally psychologically troubled individual. Oh yes, and a woosey CRY BABY!His book sounds like the fantasy world he wished he lived in but can only write about.BILL, YOU ARE A SAD EXAMPLE FOR HUMANITY. THANK GOD FOR PEOPLE LIKE CHRIS MATTHEWS. Between you, hannity and limbO, this world would definitely go to hell in a hand basket. But we have MSNBC and the Democratic Party to rescue us from your insanity and cheap pornography!Get a life Bill, leave the DARK SIDE of politics."
2,Fast-paced but uneven,"O'Reilly did a good job of confirming what most of us have suspected about the world of television news. But the story is uneven and predictable. The dialog is stereotypical and amateurish. I did enjoy the first half of the book where he did a good job of building the characters. However, the story took too many predictable or unexplainable turns, ultimately leading to an unsatisfying ending. This book goes straight in the trash - something I rarely do. I wouldn't want my friends to waste their time."
2,Should Probably Stick to Non-fiction,"I enjoy some of O'Reilly's non-fiction work as well as his conservative news show. However, I found this fiction suspense novel a little sub-par. Perhaps some of it was that I had trouble reading and turning off my preconceptions of him as a news commentator. the negative was that it was a bit shallow with the character development and story-telling. on the positive side though, it does give a layman a glimpse inside the cutthroat world of mass media and prime time news."
3,This book was previously published...,"I haven't read this book but readers should know this book was published back in 1998 or so originally. This novel wasn't written now when O'Reilly is at the top of his game. If so, I imagine it would have been held to a higher standard of quality based on the bad reviews it is getting."
3,Pretty Good First Effort,"This book is a pretty good first effort from Mr. O'Reilly. He does a really good job giving you an idea of what each character is like. The main thing that bugged me was the dissapearnce of the David Wayne character, what the heck happened to him? I was expecting some sort of big twist with him at the end, but the guy never returned. What's up with that?"
1,Incompetence,"If you like lame, sophomoric writing, with a strong dash of personal bias and enmity thrown in as poorly disguised faux-narrative, this is just the book for you.Ostensibly written by a second-rate intellect, (but surely 'brushed up"" by a scrivener with at least a B.A.) I found the prose stupefying, the plot manipulations childishly tedious, and the less-than spectacular ending deducible by the 25th page.It is, however, an accurate commentary on 21st Century America, an island of stupidity in a sea of trivia. A perfect symbol for O'Reilly."
2,Only moderately interesting,"This book is ok for light reading, I suppose. You learn a little about the world of media ambition, but since human nature is no different in different professions what you learn is hardly surprising. The sex is pedestrian and the murder plot not very exciting. I like O'Reilly because he is a right-wing talk-show host who is not a crazy Fascist like Hannity and Limbaugh and Gallagher and the rest, but a reasonable man. But he should stick to his radio and t.v. programs and give up writing the great American novel, which this is hardly."
4,O'Reilly a factor in suspense thriller,"Buy it at Amazon.com288 pages - Bantam Press(April 1998)If you like watching Bill O'Reilly on Fox News, you will be delighted by this novel. You will wonder how O'Reilly ever kept his career in the industry when you learn that the novel is about a crazed newsman who is killing the people responsible for hurting his career and that the story has scathing images of venal, corrupt, cowardly, and dishonest newspeople.This is a very entertaining book in which nasty careerist, anti-news journalists manipulate and cheat their way until they meet with deservedly bitter consequences. It is a double-edged mystery with a clever New York detective and an attractive New York columnist, who, of course, fall for each other (actually told with more subtlety than I associate with O'Reilly). But the real entertainment is in the devastating description of television news and the maneuvering, commercial/careerist values, which dominate the profession. A good read."
1,Terrible,"If you value good writing, stay far away from this book. Highschool students could easily top this in terms of literary style and cohesiveness. Aside from that, the story isn't even interesting, just a ton of sex and swearing. Bad effort from a bad writer."
1,"I'm a writer, not a leftie","I watch The Factor on a regular basis and listen to the Radio Factor frequently as well. O'Reilly's hectoring of his guests sometimes turns me off, but not nearly as much as this book did. He's an intelligent man and, I assume, well-read, but his prose is nothing more than amateurish. Some spin-free words of advice, Bill: Show, don't tell."
1,"Poor guy, someone should've told him","I don't know much about Bill O'Reilly beyond his being a controversial ""personality."" I picked up this book in an airport because I like mysteries and it looked interesting. Trust me, it's not. I guess the problem with being a ""personality"" is that people can't separate you from your work, so people who like you give everything thumbs up, and people who dislike you give everything thumbs down. This is definitely a case where Bill's friends should have told him to stick with the day job. If you just want to put a couple of bucks in Bill's pocket, buy this book. If you want to read a well-written, gripping mystery, try Dennis Lehane, or Patricia Cornwall, anyone but Bill O'Reilly. Don't believe me? Just read the first sample page!"
1,Laugh out loud funny . . .,"oh wait, he was serious? I have read many books in my life, but this - what can I say? I wish that you were able to get into the book from this site, because you could see how horrendous it is. I imagine that would largely decrease the sales though. However, if you want to see the ""infamous"" O'Reilly's less-than-mediocre attempt at fiction for a laugh - go for it. If you want a decent bit of reading material - keep looking."
1,Vile as a pubic hair on a falafel,"Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon."
1,You have got to be kidding...,"Is it not obvious to everyone who sees this book that the murderer is supposed to be dear old Bill? I mean, come on! Someone really needs to watch out for this guy. when he's finally taken down, loses his TV show, and is shown to be the worthless dreg of society he is, he's going to get a gun and go after people. Dan Rather better have good bodyguards.And beyond that, this book is badly written, sopilistic, and contains a lot of filth. i've seen better porn on the internet."
1,O'Reilly style,"Just more of the same old nonsense from Bill. He shows us here how he is completely out of touch with mainstream views and does not support freedom, liberty, or the US Constitution and has no respect at all for the founding fathers of the USA."
1,It's a murdered book,O'Rielly has no imagination. Everything is very predictable. You'll know the ending after a few minutes.BIG waste of time and money. I'd rather read a children's book than something by this guy again.
1,Freaking Hilarious,Pathetic. Better than reading the book is to hear him (in his own pompous voice) read for the audio edition. OMGoodness.
4,Could not put it down. Fun reading.,Tells a great action-suspense story about ego-ridden TV press corps
3,Gee...I wonder who the killer is,"Bill has turned out to be a relatively suspenseful fiction writer. His set ups and intertwining story lines build up the tension that make for a good murder mystery. What would make it better murder mystery is if he did not give away the identity of the murderer early on in the story. So many clear give-aways!!Bill turns up the heat a couple of times so discretion should be observed when recommending this book to others. That being said, I hope he writes another fiction book soon."
4,A Good Fiction Novel Worth Reading,"O'Reilly made his bones as a respected television journalist, but he may just have a calling in the literary world. This is formulaic fiction from jump, but it's also a captivating story centering around issues of revenge and tyranny in the corporate world of network news.... All in all, this book is well worth reading and not the general waste of time that so much popular fiction is today."
1,The Truth Shall Set You Laughing,"When I read Al Franken refer to this book of Bill O'Reilly's, I laughed, almost not believing it could be true. Upon finding that it is, I laugh more; the truth, this time, is a joke: the absurdity of O'Reilly's reality, which could be called O'Reiallity (a parallel universe, we must assume), is enough to fill a head with happy sounds."
1,"O'Reilly shares his own ""Good Vibrations"" !","O'Reilly has really outdone himself this time, and that's no exaggeration! He is obviously an author who is capable of probing his own deepest recesses in order to come up with such a literary treasure.True, there will always be those naysayers who would counter that O'Reilly is only ""plugging himself"" his books. However, I feel that plugging himself (with a book or anything else) is something that Mr. O'Reilly would only dare to do in the privacy of his own home, at least until that pesky lawsuit goes away..."
2,"Bad writing, bad editing, OK plot","I threw this book away when I finished, something I reserve for opuses that I'm disgusted with myself for getting through. (I've done with Grisham, too, so I suppose that augurs well for O'Reilly. The basic problem is that he can't write. And yeah, the TV business is cutthroat, but we already know that. So ... wooden characters, wooden writing, a wooden (paperback) book."
1,Are you kidding????,The professional spinster of news/pathetic short-winded commentary has done the same with the sad attempt for a romance-ish murder mystery. Can't say too much else because it would be a waste of space.
1,Is this guy looking out for my kids?,TRASH. Someday he may fall off that moral high horse if he keeps this up.
1,The only good thing about this book,"is its hypocrisy. Sure the writting is mediocre and the story simplified. The good part is that it's filled with sex, profanity and murder, all three such moral aspects to put in a book, writte by such a moral man as O'Reilly. It would've gotten 2 stars if he had added a loofah."
1,just stick to intimidating petite women bill...,"o'reilly seens to have channeled all of his past revenge fantasies into this cockroach infested tome. o'reilly's writing style is a cross between travis bickle of ""taxi driver"" and those creepy guys in sticky raincoats you see hanging outside Britney Spears concerts."
1,My opinion,"Bill O'Reilly's book ""Killing Lincoln"" was an amazing read. I couldn't put it down. I put this book down before I got through the first chapter.The profanity, in my opinion was completely unnecessary. Bill is too good at what he does to need the profanity. Once again,""Killing Lincoln"" proves that."
2,For Diehard Fans Only,"Believe it or not (and far too many people will not) this review has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with my love of the mystery form. O'Reilly, known primarily for his television and radio shows, decided to branch out into the world of genre fiction and has crafted a functional, but not very interesting, mystery in which TV network execs are getting clipped. It includes some fairly typical characters such as the ubiquitous tough-but-tender Irish cop, a hard-drinking veteran journalist, and an ambitious tabloid reporter.The interesting part of the novel was Mr. O'Reilly's description of how ruthless TV politics can be. Because of this, I thought it would be far more interesting as a work of nonfiction. O'Reilly, apparently, is not crazy enough to bite the hands that feed him just yet.My guess is that if you're a fan of Bill O'Reilly, you will enjoy the book. However, if it's a good mystery you're after you've so many other choices. Give this one a pass."
4,Those Who Trespass,"kept my interest, O'Reilly does surprise me with his talents in the writing department, a very competent Author who does his research."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Didn't quite know what to expect, as O'Reilly is not known as a novelist. Contrary to its sales record and O'Reilly's bloviating, I was not that impressed with ""Killing Lincoln."" So my expectations for ""Those Who Trespass"" were not high. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a pretty solid mystery with a good bit of ""inside baseball"" about network television. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to those who like mysteries."
1,Total Garbage,"Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed."
1,Wow this is BAD!,"I got this from a friend who bought it at Goodwill for a dime. She spent a dime too much, but at least the money went to goodwill. The style of the writing is that of a fourth grader, a sexually awkward fourth grader. HIs writing style is wooden, mechanical, stiff, and dull. The sex scenes are disturbingly stilted, the suspense is non-existent and the main character is OBVIOUSLY some fantasy that the author has of himself. This book is a joke! HIDEOUS!!!!!"
1,Aweful,Further proof that not everyone who can write a novel. This had to been published solely on his reputation.
4,The story pulls you along,"I don't believe in speed reading, but I read this 374 page paperback in just over a day. It has a momentum of its own.I suspected that the broadcast world was full of back stabbing. This insider confirmed it. I couldn't sympathize with the victims. Apparently, neither could O'Reilly. If you have ever wanted to systematically kill off everybody who has stepped on your head on their way up the ladder, I suggest you do what Bill O'Reilly did: act out your fantasy on paper and look for a publisher. I sensed some very real grudges coming through this story.Some of the events were a bit far fetched for me, but I suspect O'Reilly had to tone down what he really wanted to see his anti hero do to these executive jerks."
3,Cheesy Brain Candy but not bad for what it is,"And in case that title doesn't give enough detail... The looks behind the scenes at the television industry are interesting, though folks who aren't fans of the author (myself included) may feel the need to take some of it with a grain of creative and dramatically licensed salt.On the whole, it's a decent, if slightly cheesy, mystery and good for killing a few hours of time. I'd receommend a library or used book store. While it's not terrible, it's certaily not worth the cover price. Reads a little like a bad 40s PI novel sometimes (ie a bit on the pulpy side)."
2,Fond of Money,"Bill O'reilly wrote this book a while back before he began his Fox-fueled ride into greatness. I became aware of this book (a book-lover friend told me about it). She said it was ""unbelievable"". I read it. It was. It reminded me of the soft core porno I tried to write for money in college. My girlfriend at that time read my work, laughed at me, and told me ""Irish guys cannot write porno.""Now, post-Fox grandeur, O'reilly not only admits he wrote it, he goes along with reprinting ""Tresspass"" and re-releasing it. Jesus, has the man no sense? Or as I fear, has his love for $ consumed him? I think it's the later. (I think, underneath the bully persona, O'reilly is actually pretty smart)Re the book: Well, as the woman said, ""Irish guys can't write porno."" O'reilly claims that this is a ""thriller"", but ,even by that genre's standards, ""THT"" doesn't make it. I just hope he's giving the profits for this book away to somebody worthy. The ACLU?"
5,Excellent Book,I could not put this book down. It's that good. Bill O'Reilly could easily be one the best mystery writers of our times.
5,Great addition to our soccer ornament collection!,We decided to do our tree in an all soccer theme this year and this little guy was a great addition to it!
5,excellent christmas story,"Very nice story to tell to young children for Christmas, especially from a Christian viewpoint. Text is simple and the illustrations are nicely done."
5,"A wonderful, colorful book for preschoolers.","I love this book - my children love this book. We bought it several years ago for my first child; it is now well-loved and well-worn. I teach at a Christian preschool and I am buying each child a copy for Christmas this year. I read it to them last week and the pictures and the suspense of ""Who is coming to our house?"" held them enthralled and quiet through the entire book...A high recommendation from 12 four-year olds!"
3,Forgetable Book,"I bought this book for my 2 y/o daughter based on the rave reviews and it really fell short of expectations for me. It is a cute book with lots of animals, and my daughter does like the animals. However, the purpose of buying this book was to teach the Christmas story and this book does not do that. The whole book, except the last couple pages, are animals in the stable saying ""Who is coming to our house?"" and cleaning the stable. Then suddenly Baby Jesus is there and the animals know Baby Jesus is coming to their house. That is basically the whole story. It doesn't teach anything about bible story of Christ's birth. I gave it 3 stars because of the appeal of the animals, but I do not recommend this book if you want to teach your child the story of Christ's birth. Don't believe all the rave reviews, buy something else."
1,Disappointing,"Picked this up in the store after a very cursory glance through - and wish I had spent more time looking it over. Honestly, the rhyming is dreadful and there's no real rhythm. The story concept is great, and I was expecting the story of Jesus' birth, from the point of view of the animals, but the entire book is the animals saying ""someone's coming"" and then on the last page Mary and Joseph show up on a donkey."
5,Excellent First Text,"A very good book for someone that has never studied this subject before. It's clearly written, and has very good practical examples. I was able to easily work the problems in the end of the chapters using the equations and examples in the text. To use this book, you need to have elementary knowledge of mechanics of materials, basic structural design, and matrices. There is a very good appendix on matrices, which helps you work through that part of FEM."
3,Problems in the details,"More than likely you are looking at buying this book because it's required for a class. First things first, the book itself is chock full of great examples, with more examples for the more challenging sections. It explains several types of solution methods for each type of element. The only problem with this book, and I feel it is significant, is that there are a fairly large number of mistakes. Answers are provided in the back of the book but are regularly incorrect. Some of the examples also are off because they randomly multiply by a constant that shouldn't be there or raise a term to the third when it should be the second. The book also suffers slightly from formatting when it reduces the size of a matrix to make it fit more easily, leaving you to wonder what happened to the rest of it."
2,Not Yet Shipped!!,"Hi,I have ordered this item almost 5 days ago and it is not shipped yet! If you don't have it just put it as out of stock and do not steal people time.Thanks"
2,Appalachian Journey is Fabulous!,Excellent music! A treat to have such talented musicians joined by Alison Krauss and James Taylor. Pure enjoyment!
4,A Beautiful Simple Introduction,"The beautifully illustrated small booklette in French is a collection a few dozen wise sayings from Norse epics. Each saying is present on one page with an opposing full color page of an appropriately themed ancient stone & wood etchings or monkish manuscript. What is so delightful, is that the difficult-to-appreciate stone etchings have been carefully chalked and colored so that it is powerfully moving.This is more of an eye-opening ""sampler"", rather than an in-depth look at the topic of ancient Scandavian thought. Hopefully, it will encourage further study."
3,"Pronunciation guide is a little off, but ...","...at least it HAS pronunciation listed for each phrase! Most books and reference materials leave this part out. However, the phonetic spelling for each phrase or word leaves a bit to be desired. The pronunciation for Gracias is listed as gras-yas. Depending on where you live and whether you use a long a or not, your diction could be quite garbled.The phrases are useful, but the page set-up is not very clear. I would say this is a pretty decent text, but not my first choice for a travel or phrase guide. Not great, but not terrible. This is directed more toward traveling rather than actually acquiring language or forming original sentences.Sra. GoseAuthor of Spanish Fun Activity Calendar& Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 (Book + CD)"
5,Wooooooo!!!!!!,"""These shades are the millenium!!!! I look gorgeous wearing my KD Biker Shades!!!!! I got the red lenses! It is just like I said before the ladies are gonna be lining up to talk to PeNName in these KD Harley Biker Shades!!!"" I put em on and shut up and drive!!!!!"
1,"Avoid - Brooks' ""Anthem"" is a fragment","I bought this CD just to get ""Rewriting The National Anthem - Albert Brooks"", from an out of print vinyl LP that I remember from my old college radio station days.The CD started of well enough with the Brooks routine exactly as I remembered hearing it, but then the track inexplicably faded out about a third of the way through. At that, I stopped listening and relegated the CD to my give-away/trade-in stack. I have no faith that any of the other tracks are complete.Avoid this one, unless you enjoy being frustrated by comedy routines cut off in the middle."
2,It's OK not Good,"Grabbed this tool as I had a few outlets to replace around the house. It worked perfectly at first but after 5 or so outlets it became noticeably harder to strip the wire and it had a tendency to twist when cutting the copper wire. In the end, I'd buy a different tool."
3,Wheelchair Fleece Arm Covers,I was looking for some arm covers for my mother's wheelchair. They are nice and soft. They are a bit long and do not fit a standard chair well. Velcro is good on them.
3,Turned colors right away,"The first day this had water in it the brass look was gone. It's white and gray now. Not completely a bad look, but when the water is gone it looks white and powdery. Birds don't use it but animals drink out of it. As long as they aren't getting sick from whatever is happening to the metal..."
3,Too shallow for birds,This is a very nice garden sculpture at $9.99. It is attractive and well made and is actually nearly black rather than bronze in color. The problem with it as a bird bath is that the bowl is far too deep for birds to actually use as they prefer very shallow water. The item would be better as a bird feeder.
2,Not haunted enough,"Aidan Quinn, with his unearthly pale eyes and great handsomeness, would seem perfectly cast as a university professor exploring a case of a ghost haunting in a great English mansion; unfortunately, his harsh American voice seems wholly out of place in this period chiller. Though the movie is redeemed in part by its great wild ending (blunted in part by poor special effects), the director, Lewis Gilbert, seems to have little feel for the Gothic mode: the house itself isn't terribly scary (and doesn't even seem very large), and there's very little sense of atmosphere. All the nighttime scenes seem unusually well lit, for example. Perhaps to convey the decadent ""Brideshead"" atmosphere, Anthony Andrews is bizarrely miscast as Kate Beckinsale's brother, despite their twenty-five years' difference in age."
3,Not what I expected,"This book is almost identical to ""The Coaching Starter Kit. It is mostly forms to be used in coaching. The good thing about this book is that all the forms are on a CD."
1,No substance,"I purchased this book as my very first coaching book. I do addiction counseling and life coaching and was hoping to find some valuable assessment tools and resources for life coaching. The forms are very contrite and lack any substance. I don't talk or think the way the author does. I would never coach this way, nor would I ever pay anyone to coach me using these forms or ideas. Poorly written and poorly developed! Not much going for this book from an academic or professional viewpoint. I found the book helpful only in that it helped define what I will absolutely NEVER do as a coach."
3,"Good, not great","There are some great forms tucked inside this book, but it is buried in a lot of ""fluff"" that doesn't lend itself to a form layout."
2,When too much is too little,Very disappointing book. The very generous invitation to adapt to one's own practice was relatively empty. So many questions just thrown out there. It is good food for thought but not a great toolkit
1,5 stars!,"When I received the potty chair, I almost missed the mini book! It was sculpted into the outside of the box and I almost threw it out! They are not kidding when they say mini, it is about 2 inches tall! Otherwise, no complaints. I want to give 5 stars, but it won't let me edit this."
3,no so perfect potty,"Cute idea -- little book is the perfect size to motivate baby to sit on the potty. It has a good sized splash guard and support for the back. Mine came cosmetically defective (picture on the front is incomplete), but the hassle of sending it back wasn't worth it. Not very easy to empty out -- I like another one I bought with a removable potty part better for this reason. Ok as an alternative potty in the 2nd bath on a different floor."
4,love it but hate to empty it,this is an awesome potty and the kids really like to use it- it's designed with their comfort in mind- I just wish there was a spot on the side that dipped in alittle to make emptying it easier- it ALWAYS drips on the floor- no matter how slow or fast you turn it over- just keep wipes nearby to clean up! they loved the book and video though!
5,A Great Potty!,"This is a great little potty seat. My son, at 27 months, was ready for potty-training, but really wasn't ready to go on the big toilet, even with a child seat. So, after some research, I ordered this stand-alone potty seat. It was just his size, and we could have it nearby when he needed it. Within a few days, he was accident-free, and three weeks later, he was ready to retire the little potty chair and crawl up on the big toilet all by himself. It was a great way to introduce potty-training, and even though we didn't use it long, it was a great investment. Like most potty seats, little boys can easily spring a leak if not seated correctly, so we did have a spill now and then, but relatively few in comparison with other seats. We are very, very pleased with our purchase."
4,Why the non-Christian philosophies of history don't work,"Well, this book is all about that, so I won't tell you why. But, if you are interested, you should read it. Unfortunately, Nash seems to waste some of his time discussing the authorship of the book of Hebrews. One wishes that he could have expounded a little more on the Christian philosophy of history. But, I think that Nash did a great job in introducing the main philosophies of history of the Western world. Note: the ""cyclical,"" ""linear,"" ""spiral"" stuff, in my opinion, is all about the ""One"" and the ""Many"" (i.e., the Trinity). You see, we need just as much of a Trinitarian philosophy of history as we do a Trinitarian epistemology, metaphysics, etc."
5,AMAZING with Fat Free Frozen Yogurt!,"I love this stuff! When paired with my favorite low cal, no fat FroYo -- I am am in TOTAL heaven. I discovered this one day in Bloomingdale's 57th Street Cafe -- I saw all these thin and attractive ladies eating Vanilla yogurt with Melba drizzle. So delicious, SO VERY satisfying and SO much better than a fattening dessert. LOVE THIS STUFF!!"
1,EXTREMELY limited in size and scope!,"Very tiny book- 94 pages and about 3.5 inches sq. with around 4 words/ phrases per page. I dont feel it would get you terribly far eg: looking at the food section, it tells you how to ask for an apple juice but not the more common orange. The shopping section lacks the (in my experience vital) words for batteries and postage stamps. OK it's cheap and lightweight but I would ABSOLUTELY go for a Berlitz phrasebook or similar- much more useful"
3,Quite a nice song...,"Though I'm absolutely not crazy about boybands, I really like this track, but the lyrics are just... you know, the typical boyband whining. Melody and vocals are nice."
5,A wonderful recording,"Dave Brubeck and his Quartet join with symphony and choir to record some of his major choral works. Based in biblical and religious themes, for the most part, this is the first occasion for many of us to hear these amazing compositions. The recording is pristine, the performances are beautiful. This double CD is a feast for the ear and the imagination. Don't pass it up."
5,The title of the album says it all,One of the true geniuses of the jazz age. This is a decent collection of his liturgical compositions. Probably not to everyone's taste but it shows another side of the man that is just as interesting.
1,The Nazarenes,Poorly written book. The subject (Nazerene) matter was vague and poorly studied. Authur made poor attempt to get the message across by not staying with the theme of the book. While the other area of the book could of have tided it in nicely. Mr. Gibson failed to grab or keep me interested on the topic. I have read and I am a believer of the Nazarene movement. Mr Gibson I am sorry to say did a poor job on the subject. The book also had several misspelled words. I would not recommend this book. While I would say capture by the cover and title. The book does not do any justice to the subject.Sorry and Blessing in the name of the true Nazarene (Yahshua the Nazarene from Nazareth).Robert
5,Safe and easy to use container for insulin needles,"Today I ordered a new BD Home Sharps Container for my insulin needles. It is my third order of this product, because it contains the needles safe and easy.There are similar containers available, but this one suits my limited space. I like the lid attached but out of the way during use, and it never gets lost."
2,"glib, facile, and disappointing","I really enjoyed Kurt Andersen's Turn of the Century,so I was looking for more books by him. Not 100 % sure this is really by the same person, but it was a total waste of time. Granted, not a lot of time, entire book can be read in one (boring) hour, but this is still time that would be better spent counting your toes. Glib, over-the-top heavy sarcasm that has all the wit and grace of a Soviet tank, and absolutely NO funny, interesting, or insightful observations. Nothing like Stanley Bing's Rome or Paul Fussell's Class."
5,"Charming, funny parable about tolerance","My kids, ages 6 and 3.5, loved this charming book almost as much as I did. It's the story of the Bottle family, who moves to a town populated by humans living in can houses. But the Bottles are not well received.""Those bottles! Why can't they be like the rest of us? Why must they always go around acting like bottles?"" When the Bottles save the town from destruction, the humans finally see the virtue of glass neighbors.The wry narrative is accompanied by wonderful 1950's-style illustrations. This is the best children's book I read this year."
1,Must have gotten the last reviewer's returned set.,At least the last reviewer's set worked for a while. Got mine out of the box and the thing would not work at all. The power supply lit and made an annoying high pitched hum but nothing more. The way the manual is written in poorly translated English reminds me of the electronic junk I used to buy as a teenager at flea markets. Think I'll try a name brand I recognize next time.
4,Good nang for the dollar,"Bought it since my daughter needed to set a tv in a rather crowded, space-constrained table. This was ideal since the price was right. Have had it for 2 weeks, works great. However, the picture tends to be on the dark side (btw, i know to make all the adjustments needed etc). Also, 3-4 cable channels had to be manually ""fine"" tuned for better picture. A truly good buy for the $. Let us hope this thing lasts for a while."
1,Color problem,"I have this LCD/TV for slightly over 1 year (1 yr 4 mth) and has been using it as a TV. And right around the time waranty is about to expire, we start seeing what is supposed to be black color is replaced by green. Other colors are displaying properly. This problem would come and go: sometimes going to ""Fine Tune"" set it all the way down and bring it back up would fix the problem for 10 minutes before it comes back again.Since it doesn't happen consistently, I made the mistake of not sending it back to the vendor. Now the warranty expired, and I am stuck with a ""green"" TV.Watch out for color problem on this TV."
3,right for the price,"for the price, this lcd is not bad at all. as others have said, the picture tends to be a bit dark. but as i found for myself, you have to set the angle of the screen to allow for best viewing. then the picture is just fine. the remote is a bit small. and the volume controlles are not that easy to deal with. but i keep the mute set to ""ON"", and use the audio from my surround system anyway. all and all, i can't complaine. it's well worth the price paid."
2,Good concept/price - Bad quality/picture,"I was looking for a small LCD TV to replace my 19"" Sony in the bed room. After I reviewed the spesification and reviews of this LCD TV, I thought this product served my needs well (cheap too) and could be my monitor's backup (good concept) as well. I had connected with TV cable and tried so hard to adjust every possible adjustments - brightness, contrast, HUE, saturation, etc. to get better picture. It failed on me (not even close). Now I am returning the TV. Amazon says that I have to pay the shipping and handling for the return because it is not their fault (which is true). So if you are looking for quality LCD TV, please go somewhere else, don't waste your time and money. I still give two stars because of its concept and price."
5,Beautiful music,I bought this CD after hearing a few of the recordings on our local NPR radio station. I was not disappointed in any of the selections. Very beautiful.
3,Not sure what to make of it,"Three well written stories that were, however a bit obscure, and not very erotic to me."
5,It was like I was reading Judy Blume for the first time...,"This book blasted me back to the past of my awkward, [...] times. I have been a MAJOR fan of Jill Soloway's for forever. The book as a whole is a lady dream, super smart and super sexy! And Jill Soloway, once again, is anything but a dissapointment. Love this book!!!!!"
3,Shorter than one would hope for.,"I received this book as an anniversary present and as I looked through it I asked my spouse ""is this a gift for you or me?"" as I pointed to the overwhelming number of naked and semi-naked images of heroines. The biggest question I had with this book was: What is the definition of heroine that both Miller and Sargent are using? Next I wanted to know why the book was so short. I've read several books about women writers, women characters, and feminism even in science fiction and fantasy. While the number of characters and authors they address is usually fewer they are more detailed. I can't say after reading this book that I understand why some of the characters are listed as heroines at all. Instead, the book seems more focused on starting to look at the changes in female characters over decades -- a topic that deserved at least twice this number of pages even if the pictures had to be a much smaller part of the concept."
1,Good idea badly executed,"This book is an interesting read on the changing roles of women in Sci Fi and fantasy, but the artwork really lets it down. It looks as though Ron Miller was in one hell of a hurry to produce enough pictures for the book and the quality really isn`t up to much. OK so I`m being critical and I freely admit I could`t do better, but that isn`t the point, there are those that can. Save your money get ""Transluminal"" or ""Chiaroscuro"" Jim Burns & Tim White show how it should have been done.Having read so many positive reviews I gave the book another chance, was I wrong ? Sorry but no, it isn't that I was expecting Boris type archetypes of perfection. I just prefer paintings where perspective and proportion have not been sacrificed in order to achieve quantity. I stand by my original rating one star only."
3,Good Service poor shipping on the part of UPS.,I love the shoe but don't agree with the picture. The picture makes them look like they are nubuck for which they are not. they are a shiny smooth leather. I ordered them because I thought they were nubuck and the shoe is made in a nubuck option. Need to change the picture. I'm going to keep them because they are so comfortable. If you're going to keep the picture then spell out in the description that they are not nubuck.
1,Airaleave did not work,I recieved the product on time. But when I tried to use it on my down spout it simply did not work. It didn't fit tightly enough in the spout and the air escaped around the sides and never developed enough power to blow any leave clogs out of the gutter. Total waste of my time and money
1,Check your downspout size.,This is a good idea and it might work if your downspout is large enough to accommodate the cleaner. My downspout is not large enough. I was able to collapse the tip enough to shove it inside the downspout but it leaked so much air around it that it wasn't effective. If they redesigned this it would be great. As is...not so great!
3,Meh,"It worked okay but not great. It opened up 2 lightly plugged downspouts but could not unplug 2 others. Also, this is a good example of a product that cures the symptoms but not the cause. Sure it can unplug (some) downspout clogs, but unless you get up there and clean out the gutters, the downspouts will just clog again."
2,Did not do the job,I bought a couple of these but it does not do the job ... There are a lot of air leaks and just slightly bloew the leaves in the down spout.
5,safest way to clean your downspouts,"I have found that the product ""Airaleave"" is all that the advertisement claims.Simple. Attach to your downspout, insert your leaf blower and the downspout iscleared of all debris. You can't find a product that has eliminated the dangersof climbing onto your roof and cleaning your downspout. I recommend this productto anyone who prefers simplicity and a time saver in maintaining their downspouts."
1,Disappointed in Mfg changes,"I purchased this item after purchasing the exact ""model"" a year earlier and found that there have been some minor mfg changes that have changed the properties of the item and thus changing it's ability to allow food stuffs to unstick themselves from the mat. The difference I noted between this mat and the identical model, mfg'd mat I purchased last year was: the border is black, the previous was a terra-cota color (I do NOT believe that this had any affect on it's properties), and the internal ""weave"" in the silicone mat seams different."
3,not totally great,"I was really excited about this coat when I orded. The material is good and acceptable quality. I loved the concept of layering so my son can wear thru the spring. However, Within the first month two buttons have come off (not a good thing for a 14 month old). The zipper is sometimes hard to zip and you need to check that the sleeves are in place each time you put the coat on - the sleeves do not stay in place when you remove the coat."
2,What should a tenant's notice to terminate tenancy look like?,"Overall the book is good but there is a huge omission that has to be corrected. While there are sample forms in the book there is no sample notice to terminate tenancy. In fact, there is no information at all about what a tenant's notice to terminate should look like. This is an enormous problem and has to be corrected.The Landlord's version of this book is much more complete. It includes a CD with PDF files for printing notices, etc. This Tenant's Rights books needs a CD with forms, including notice, to be included."
2,This version of guide is the 10th edition - published in 1989,"If you cannot purchase the latest edition from Amazon -- not something that is as out-dated as this one -- then go to a physical bookstore and buy or order the latest edition from it. California's state codes for tenants and landlords have been amended several times since 1989. If Nolo cannot keep up with the changes, it should get out of the business of publishing books about California tenants rights (and for landlords, as well)."
1,Do not buy this book! It is 5 years outdated and should not be for sale on this site,"Do not buy this book! It is 5 years outdated and should not be for sale on this site.Read the detailed description of this book, it is from 2005, so save your money and make sure you buy legal books that are current from 2009-2010 only.They should include the 2005 date in the book title so buyers can clearly see how old this book is."
4,Siberian Tigers (In the Wild),"This book was refreshing. The writer of this book has it figured out..take care of the creatures now while we still have their beautie. Really good book with close up and personal photos. Great, informative book!"
4,Definitely worth it,I am new for leasing commercial properties - but it definitely gave a foundation on the required check list and clauses I should look for. I am going to use this to crosscheck my attorney's final draft and to make sure the attorney did not miss anything important.Would definitely recommend as a reference.
4,Negotiating Commercial Real Estate Leases,"This book is very informative and well written. Mr. Zankel offers a number of excellent examples and some very well written and usefull clauses. I enjoyed his writing style and sense of humor. The only negative is that I was hoping for a more step-by-step plan that was offered. It is a fine book and should be in every leasing agents library.Adam P. Von Romer, CCIM"
2,Not particularly helpful,"I am an attorney who regularly handles leases for a large company. I had hoped that this book would be a practical guide to negotiating commercial real estate leases, but it seemed more like a theoretical tract than a useful tool in my practice."
2,A virtually worthless book,"I sat down to read this book one night and had the most difficult time reading it (I am well-educated, for any doubters).The analogies the author uses to explain things are so poor and quite irritating. He uses this same mode in explaining everything so that the entire book is completely obnoxious to read. I came very close to throwing this book away! Do yourself a favor and get a book that will clearly/logically explain things with creating gross irritation."
4,"No problems, just as expected","This is the carb kit for my carb, but it still came with way too many pieces and it didn't have one gasket, which I had to order from another company. Annoying, but that seems to be the way of these rebuild kits (for older carbs)."
1,J.U.N.K.,"I'm a woman and I made two attempts at turning off a shutoff valve (correct direction just in case anyone's wondering) and the handle snapped off the top of the key. Sturdy steel? I think not. It snapped easier than a candy cane. A little resistance while attempting to turn off a valve and the thing is rendered useless...got it at Lowe's not Amazon otherwise it would be sent back. I did notice on the label that it had check boxes to indicate which of the several countries listed that the tool was made. Mine had Mexico, USA, China, and somewhere else listed. The ""X"" was marked by China."
3,a documentary and not much more....,if you are a hardcore collector and have all the tcm films than pick it up other than that just pass along by it. its a good sidekick to the pioneer special edition.
5,That family will always be in meat!,"This video is not released in UK but only now have they released TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE -THE SHOCKING TRUTH which is basically the same documentary as this. It was really good to hear cast and crew talk about their parts in creating horror history. We also see some footage of the sequels that never lived up to the original film. If your a fan of TCM then you really should get this gem of a video. And to all the UK fans, buy the vid at HMV and you get a free CD featuring a song from the film ('Fool for a blonde')."
4,for fans who love and appreciate these amazing actors,"Yes, it was made on the cheap and shot on tape, but so what? Could be that was the best the filmmaker was able to do.We're grateful for the privilage of seeing these exemplary actors interviewed. Not only are they superstars of horror, but so talented, in my opinion, that they could have done terrific work in any genre. And I have been saying this for decades.Why hasn't it happened? Why haven't they been given work in mega-budgeted ""mainstream"" films? Simple: because the horror genre (I state this appreciating almost every genre, with the exception of the romantic comedy, which I loath with a passion) is cinema's black sheep. Mind you, not to those who revere it and know it takes just as much hard work and sweat to make a great scare flick as it does any other type of flick, but to those who not only can't relate to the horror tale, but refuse to in any shape or form."
4,Well written,"Even though the graphics in the beginning leave something to be desired and could easily be updated, this is my favorite beginning drum book. For one thing, it contains the 'rudiments,' which I find an important part of the learning process. The rhythmic concepts and technical aspects (flams, drags, etc) are introduced in a logical order that the student can easily grasp."
5,Excellent,"This pudding tastes identical to Stallone's Instone brand, though it sells for a lot less. Just like Instone, this has 100 calories, and 20 grams of protein. It's creamy and very good!I've tried the chocolate, as well, and although I almost always prefer chocolate to other flavors, the vanilla is actually better tasting than chocolate, but the chocolate is good, too, though not quite as flavorful."
5,Great stuff,"Although the Instone banana flavor is the best tasting in my opinion, the Snack & Slim appears to be identical except for the label at only two thirds the cost, so it is really hard to beat. I am on a reduced calories low cholesterol diet, and this pudding is a great way to get some healthy soy protein as well as calcium without a lot of calories. I enjoy both the vanilla and chocolate flavors. I have given it to friends and some love it and some hate it, so it just depends on the individual. Probably a slight sucralose (splenda) aftertaste, although I don't notice it. I love this stuff and am hooked."
1,Disappointing,"I love desserts so after reading a couple of reviews about this protein pudding, I was all excited to try it. Now I'm trying to give this stuff away. I do think that it is better at room temperature than cold. The flavor reminded me of sweetened glue (come one we've all tried glue as kids; right?) I do not like it at all. It was also pricey and the amount is such that I'll be sneaking it to leave at friend's houses for awhile."
2,Star Wars Economy Darth Vader Adult,"The quality of the costume matches the name - ECONOMY. Cape made from thin fabric, edges didn't hemmed, chest piece has chemical odor, the only good thing is mask. Economy costume should cost less than 32USD."
4,Ultimately Uplifting,"Though often filled will speculation, Lucado does a wonderful job of getting us to think about what it will be like when Christ returns, but also what this return means to how we live now. The difficult issue of Hell and eternal punishment is attacked head on, leaving little room to wonder about the truth of this doctrine. Overall, an uplifting book that takes a while to get started, but once it does, it will hold your interest."
5,"His ""Very Best"" Yet","I've read almost all books by Max Lucado and he outdid himself on this one. They keep getting better. Any time you want to be uplifted or need to feel closer to God, just pick up a Max Lucado masterpiece. His writing is so mellow yet his teachings are adapted perfectly from the Bible. I could write 5,000 words and not be finished. P.S. If you are a new convert to Christ, Lucado's books will help you understand lots of questions immediately!"
4,The Second Coming,"Max Lucado gives an easy-to-understand explanation of the Second Coming of Christ in this book. He uses Scripture, along with examples from everyday life, to show what it will be like. He advises the reader on what his attitude should be while ""waiting forwardly"" for Christ. He tells us what Scripture means when it says we will be raised to Heaven at our death and will be given a new body when Christ returns. He tells us about the difference between being saved and then about appearing before God on Judgment Day. He emphasizes God's grace and the defeat of Satan. This is a clear and concise book which will give the Christian a positive feeling about the Second Coming."
5,It is wonderful !,It is a must read for all. This book will be a comfort for all Christians who have lost loved ones.
5,Walk yourself Fit,"This is a great DVD easy to follow, you work up a good sweat quick. A nice addition to my DVD's My wife loves it!"
5,"Great, easy-to-follow exercise DVD","I really like ""walking"" exercise DVD's and have purchased quite a few over the years. This is the best one I've purchased to date! The routines are not too hard, they're fun and easy to follow. Chris Freytag is very likeable and explains each move before she does it."
1,AWFUL!,This is terrible to follow. She changes steps with little or no warning! She doesn't describe what is coming up and the steps change so fast that there would seem to be no benefit from it! The music is dull and annoying and I don't like looking at her belly button for the whole work out.
3,No more Prevention exercise tapes,I have bought several exercise tapes through Prevention. I have not liked any of them. The moves are not smooth or go together well. I usually end up with some injury after I have done one of Chris' tapes especially the knees. She tries to be different but it doesn't work. There are too many other good dvd's out there without wasting your time and money on Prevention's! This is not a walking tape like most walking tapes where you stay in one place. It is more of an overall workout.
1,Prevention Fitness Systems: Walk Yourself Fit,Not enough time walking. I thought this would be walk aerobics. Instead it is only 20 minutes of walking. Also no proper warmup and cool down.
4,Excellent reference,"If you are at all concerned about environmental impact on health, this is a must read. Perfect reference when considering a move to a new city."
2,Not up to par for Metheny,"Look, if Pat Metheny is your religion, you'll like this album. I'm sure the music worked quite well in the movie. It's very atmospheric but it just doesn't do justice to a full CD. It's too long, there are sections that are mostly strings or synthesizers and very little Metheny. But if you like this, and even if you don't, you'll like the soundtrack of The Straight Story better. Lots of Metheny-like guitar, pastoral-like scenes and overall better melodies with much less aimless filler. If you insist on buying it, I suggest heavy editing to a cassette with The Straight Story on the reverse. Good for a quiet drive in the countryside."
4,Great Soundtrack,That's what is intended for and that's waht it is. It has by no means the strenght of Beyond The Missouri Sky. It is also not another Secret Story. It is a sound track and based on that it is very nice to listen to. Acoustic guitar with a Chamber Orchestra. The basic melody is lovely!
5,Worked great,"On a motorcycle trip to Helen, Ga, my Garmin 550 just stopped working. When returned home I contacted Garmin and they said that I'd need to figure out if the problem was the 550 or the battery. To do so, they said remove the old battery and then plug the Gamin in. If the unit came on, it was a battery problem, if it did not come on, the itself was the problem.Well, thankfully, the unit came on (without the old battery) so it was a bad battery. I bought this one, put it in the Garmin and it fired right up. Have had no problems at all.At least, in the future, if the battery goes out again, I'll know that I can still used the ""down"" Garmin by just removing the battery and plugging it in."
3,Don't expect to quickly swap out batteries,"This is really a criticism of the Zumo, and not the battery. I purchased this at the same time I ordered my Zumo 550, expecting that I'd be able to charge multiple batteries and swap out batteries if one ran low. No such luck, as the Zumo's design doesn't allow for quick and easy battery swapping. Fortunately, it ended up being easy to wire the Zumo up to get power directly from my motorcycle's battery."
3,SENSELESS but the sex is great.,"I'm not even goin' to lie to you. MISTRESS FRANKENSTEIN is the most senseless film I've have ever seen! ALthough, I would say, that it is far better than a MAX after dark special, the MAX after dark films at least have a storyline and a plot. The lesbianic scenes are fantastic. The first, second, and fourth are my favorites. But that's just me. If you decide to buy this film, buy it for the sex not for to sit through and watch because that would be torture!"
2,Hot lesbians and nothing else...what'd you Xpect,"Frankenstein spoof by guys who probably watched the original Frankenstein high on weed! These guys have an almost gleeful contempt for things like plot, humor, story, etc...Never mind that, this company is at its best when it just focuses on its cadre of hot babes pretending to get it on together - love Darian Caine and Misty Mundae! All of these scenes are hot, long and will ""get you there"" if you're into it. They should really add a DVD option that allows you to play only the sex straight thru w/ no story, or put out a compilation DVD of the sex scenes in their roster of movies.If you want something erotic with at least an attempt at story, get Warhol's Frankenstein, or The Bride w/ Jennifer Beals if you want something thoughtful (though not super hot)."
3,horse before cart,"I admire Dershowitz a great deal and wanted to like the book. However, his major thesis is fatally flawed. Since most serious scholars agree that Genesis was writtem/compiled/edited after the Exodus experience (i.e., ranging from the Davidic monarchy to the post exilic period), it's more than a little disingenuous to suggest that the 10 commandments stemmed from these 10 stories (especially in their finished form). Furthermore, I think Dershowitz grossly misuses the evidence, forcing the narratives to answer questions they were never concerned with."
4,Provides a new way to appreciate Genesis,"This book has a fascinating premise, and I enjoyed reading it. I was familiar with many of the stories discussed, but Professor Dershowitz places the people and events into a very interesting socio/economic/political/legal context. I am reading Genesis again because of the book, and I am enjoying it much more."
2,Disappointingly simple,"Dershowitz is a great legal mind, but he doesn't appear to be much of a biblical scholar. While the analysis in this book is fine as far as it goes, each of Dershowitz's examples is fairly straightforward (e.g. Cain kills his brother and is punished only with exile), and any reader could find similar ones on their own. His discussion of each example is superficial, rarely going beyond a simplistic discussion of why it is unfair that Cain gets off lightly, or why God sends the flood and kills virtually the entire world. He rarely offers any useful insight into how these stories are more or less than they appear or how they have affected our views of justice."
1,I can't-I'm laughing too hard!,"Oh this is rich. That indefagitable giant of the Bar Alan Dershowitz waxing eloquent on justice. Oh well, I guess this is par for the course- embrace your failings as if they were strengths.When I stop laughing I suppose fear will set in. Fear that this master of constitutional de-construction will actually be taken seriously. Go back to chasing ambulances and defending celebrity murderers. But don't expound on justice as if justice ever meant anything before you wrote this put up job."
2,Extreme(ly) Dated Material,"Even at the one cent price paid for a second hand copy, this title is not a good value for money. The book's tag line says ""what they teach at Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program,"" however, the content covers only a small number of the program's topics with chapters with topics that are not cohesively presented. Aside from presenting an unofficial potted history of the AMP, there is little--if any--original material presented.The book offers a small collection bullet lists of lessons learned by several program participants from 1996. Material also includes simple and inconclusive Q&A; interviews with program staff and students from the same timeframe. Even when originally published in 2001, the material was very dated. A book with this tag line should produce an executive summary of the now eight week, $60,000 program, and provide insight to future participants what to expect from their participation."
5,The only guide to Wyoming you'll need,"I shall be visiting Wyoming later this year, and this book (and its accompanying website) has proved to be invaluable in planning my trip. Everything you'll ever need to know about the state is here - maps, accommodation, restaurants, shopping and much more. I particularly like the detailed histories of the various Wyoming towns that are included - not something that you'll find in the usual guide books.I'd definitely recommend this book to anybody planning to visit Wyoming, and even if you're not planning a visit but are just interested in the state it is still well worth reading."
3,ultimate wyoming atlas and travel encyclopedia,"This book does have a lot of information. I was hoping to find out what each town was like today, not back in the 1800's. I was interested in finding out what each town offered as far as shopping, schools, hospitals, etc... Instead it is more of a history lesson."
4,The Ultimate Wyoming Atlas & Travel Encyclopedia,"This book has everything about the whole state of Wyoming. I has been useful for information to the surrounding town near Yellowstone for me. I believe I can say the information is almost endless, the book is large, so lots of info."
2,Sweet and light reading...,"Christmas is just for children, God's children, that is. In these five, four classic and one new, stories, Mary Balough reminds her readers that the true gift of Christmas is love. A shaky marriage is almost broken by a loss, then mended by the same thing. Lonely hearts are pried open to let love in, families are patched together, and children tie lost souls together.** These stories are quickly read, and lightweight, but with a sweet profoundness. You can read them all at once or just have one at a time for a mental snack. Fans will enjoy them.**Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,Simply Beautiful Christmas Stories,"My only issue with anthologies is that just when you are getting into it, and falling in love with the characters and their story, it all comes to an abrupt end! That never seemed more true than with this anthology. I loved each and every one of these stories and fell in love with the characters that brought them to life. I wanted to know more about them and I wanted their stories to go on and on. One thing I love about Mary Balogh is how true to the period she is, the manners and customs of 'the Ton' and society. She didn't stray one iota and it's very refreshing. What's more, even though the stories were told separately, there was a point where it felt as though the characters each could be experiencing the same Christmas simultaniously, they blended so well. Thank you, Ms. Balogh."
4,Light-hearted Christmas fare,"Five Regency Christmas stories, one original and four previously published, are contained in this collection by Mary Balogh. I consider Mary one of the best writers in her genre. Her stories are character driven rather than plot driven. I alternated read one of the Christmas stories with other books so I would no be overwhelmed with all the Christmas good cheer. I worked out nicely. All the stories are good, but the first and only original story in the book is the best one. Fans of Mary Balogh won't be disappointed and new fans will be in for a treat."
2,A disappointment,"It's not easy to tell from the description that only one of these stories is new and the remainder are republished stories. When Mary Balogh is ""on"" she writes as well as Georgette Heyer, and I can't praise anyone more highly than that. Unfortunately she doesn't have as high a batting average as GH. This anthology is particularly disappointing as I consider Balogh to be one of the most gifted short story Regency authors. This is definitely not her best work."
4,Very Nice to read,"Hat mir Gut gefallen, in typischer Mary Barlogh Manier geschrieben. Leider sind alle Geschichten sehr sehr ähnlich. Trotzdem hat es mir gefallen,ich habe es ja auch in der Vorweihnachtszeit gelesen."
2,failure after 2 months,one wire started arching after just two months forced me to replace the whole wire set. i purchased these for the name brand looks like that was a mistake.
4,Such a great remake,"So I didn't think it was possible for such a young group to pull this off. But Jump5 has been able to do an amazing job with ""We are Family"" I just got this single and play it over and over. I recently used it for a family function. Everyone should have this in their collection."
5,Both Of These Songs Are Awesome!,"We Are Family And Summer Song Are Total Awesome Songs With A High Energy Beat!I`ve Seen Jump5 In Concert One Time And They Sang Both Of These Songs!1.We Are Family-A Great Dance Song!Love It!From The 2003 Realease,Accelerate!2.Summer Song-From The 2002 Realease All The Time In The World!Another Wonderful Jump5 Song!Get This Cd!God Bless U All!!!~~~~"
1,Don't Bother!,"I sure hope my new Holley Double Pumper is better conceived and built that this damned fuel rail! It came to me vacuum packed on a card....ALREADY BENT! That should have been a warning, but of course I went ahead and straightened it, since it was the 90 degree end and not the branch coming out of the fuel block which need the adjustment. Still.....leaked like hell via a pinhole on the long branch on the down stream side of the fuel block. It's going back and I'll build my own system....sure hope that double pumper is better built!Gary Weldele"
1,Leaks all over,"I put it on following all directions, not tightening too tight, not bending it, the whole shabang. First of all, that thing was the toughest son of a gun to put on the carb, you start one end and try to start the other and it wasnt cooperating, it took a good hour for me to get lined up to start both ends! Second, when i finally got it on and started up the car it was a dang gas geyser!! It was leaking pretty bad and i tried to tighten up the fittings and they were already almost as tight as they could get! so i took that junk off and went with the hose fittings that came with my carb, not as cool looking but at least i dont have to worry about a fire!"
3,Sudden Origins,I found this book very tough going after the fifth chapter and was completely bogged down by chapter seven. The author gives an almost more-than-you-wanted-to-know account of the history of the theory of evolution and the various personalities involved with shaping it since Darwin first introduced the concept. It's definitely for the died-in-wool devotee only.
2,Funny,Nice set of laughs. Old TV version of medieval subjects are nearly as good as the new ones. Do any of the script writers do research on the original works or are they too intent on putting their own mark on traditional stories?
3,"Cute, but kinda silly...","This is a cutesie little 50's offering, but no Robin Hood or William Tell. This one strays even farther from any possible connection with history...I think the main difference is that this one can't decide if the protagonist is a hero or a comedian. The Round Table is presented pretty much as a collection of characters, none of whom are particulary outstanding in any way. None of the crises that arise are particularly interesting or important. One gets the feeling that England is a sort of medieval Gillegan's Island...but without the laugh track...which sounds like a plus, but if you had it, you'd at least know when they were TRYING to be funny...I recommend Robin Hood and William tell, and even Buccaneers, over this series---still, it's better than what's being turned out now..."
1,Diva... what were you thinking???,"I bought this DVD after reading a review in Diva magazine which describes it as 'Witty and vivacious' or something similiar. I have to say that it is the biggest load of drivel it has ever been my misfortune to watch. It is in equal measures, irritating, unappealing, self-indulgent,unintelligent and DULL. It is the story of two women, the two main actors, and how they got together, told by them in pseudo theatrical, and intensely annoying monologues, interspersed with ridiculously voyeuristic sex scenes that are about as titillating as cold pizza. Do yourselves a favour, don't bother with this rubbish, buy a nice book!!!!!"
2,All over again...,"The actresses are absolutely hot but their acting... not so much. The chars in this are so stiff and fake, the righting is poor, and the plot is see completely through. This movie is a cut out of every other for bidden love story I've ever seen all they did was erase the guy and replace it with a lesbian. I love love story but half way through I was praying for this one to end. But on the up side plenty of sex and skin but they do seem choreographed. I couldn't force myself to watch this again and strongly advise anyone else not to bother as well unless you can borrow it and really have nothing better to do."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I was never so bored with a movie. I could not wait until it was over. Thank God, I didn't buy it before I watched it."
2,A disappointment,"""Girl Play"" is a drama about two actresses falling in love. One of them is in a relationship with another woman. The story is told through lengthy monologues with flashbacks. Although the cast did a good job, I didn't like the way the story was structured. The monologues got boring pretty quickly and the story was much too thin even for a 70 minute movie. The one really good thing about the movie was Mink Stole, playing Robin's mother."
1,"Bad, Worse, Want 2 buy It","This is the worst lesbian movie I have ever seen - way worse than Claire of the Moon, which was pretty bad. I read the reviews so I bought it but I won't do that to some other sucker. Bad acting, bad story line, unattractive women, no hot scenes whatsoever.Don't waste one red cent on this one."
4,Girl Play,"I was amased at how very well acted, directed and written this movie was. The dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips. Everyone was well cast. It is great movie for anyone and transcends the lesbo-film cliche. It transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it's a ""gay"" movie. If you hated ""Go Fish"" like I did, you'll love this movie and go ""whew"" for this film - it saves our lesbian cinema souls! Buy it! you won't be sorry"
1,"Mink ""stole"" the show","I could barely make it through the dvd the first time I watched! I haven't looked at it since. This is, in my opinion, the worst lesbian dvd I've watched (and I've seen Family Affair and Late Bloomers, this is FAR worse). Mink Stole was the only bright spot, she did a lovely job. Dom DeLuise wasn't bad but was totally over the top and out of place in this video. I'd just save myself the trouble, steer clear of this one and keep looking."
1,Reconsider before you buy...,"I rented this movie for about six dollars and I have to say even that was a waste of money. I thought this movie was incredibly over acted, boring and hard on the eyes. The thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did. They were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial. For the superficial people out there I wouldn't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won't get it. When I found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible.I have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment."
2,another one bites the dust,"I feel that the lack of quality lesbian movies over the decades has caused our standards to drop to record levels. I couldn't believe the enthusiasm contained in some of these reviews, which is why I'm writing my own. This movie is terrible. I saw it on Logo, and it did not sustain my interest for more than ten minutes. First of all, the acting is beyond poor. Secondly, the series of badly acted monologues overshadows the overall storyline, which is weak. Are we still so hungry for any reflection of our lives that we'll settle for so little? C'mon, girls, we deserve and should demand better."
2,Review,"This is an okay movie, but it's more like a play. The girls are basically telling the story of how they came to be.The girls aren't very hot in the movie either. I wouldn't buy this movie at least not new anyway."
1,"A contrived, boring, stilted and unerotic lesbian movie - BAD!!!","I had such high hopes for this film and was sorely disappointed by it!!To start off, I didn't like the two leading ladies, who play two gay woman who earn parts in a play. In this play, directed by Dom DeLuise, they are supposed to play lovers. From the get go the two women are attracted to each other and one ends up dumping her long time girlfriend for the other woman.I thought this movie, which is really a play that is filmed, with LOTS of scenes with one the two lead actresses monologuing directly to the camera, was contrived, poorly written, unsexy, and boring. I was didn't think either of the actresses was portrayed as a likable or interesting person.Frankly I could hardly wait until was finished and was seriously angry that I paid over $20 for this movie!!! I give this film the lowest rating I can, which is a zero, which Amazon won't let me do. DON'T BUY THIS FILM!!!!If you still want to see it, buy mine!"
1,Hated It,This movie was a waste of time and money. I keep waiting for it to start. It was not waht I thought it would be at all. I would not even give this movie 1 star if that was an option.
3,not funny,Very disappointed. Did not like the format... very disconnected.Saw less than half of the video then stored.
2,Girl Play,Unfortunately I cant actually watch this movie as the coding is wrong for Australia! I am in the process of purchasing an DVD player that plays all international codes.
1,another bad lesbian movie,"this should never have been made into a movie. this movie remains a stage play, which happened to be filmed, to which they added a few additional cinematic scenes. if the writers wanted to make a movie of their play, they needed to take the time and effort to write a screenplay -- and actually adapt it for the screen. the direct address is painful. when we finally are shown scenes, the voice over during the scenes ruins any chance we might have of enjoying those scenes. there are lots of better ways to spend 64 minutes of your life (it's very short!)..."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is not for everyone because I got it I heard that it ws so good and then I watched and was not happy! So Im just gonna say watch it before you purchase it! Proceed at your own risk!!
1,This film sucks.,"This is a bad movie, plain and simple. There are few films more boring and badly acted than this one.Rent it or borrow it if you must but save yourself the money, you'll regret purchasing this film.This is just a self-promotion vehicle gone bad."
2,Doesn't live up to the promise,"Although on paper this receiver is great value for the money, it demonstrates the same flaw as a lower-end Pioneer receiver that I own -- namely that there's a quiet but perceptible hiss from the speakers whenever the unit is powered on.When sound is going through the unit this hiss is obviously masked, but it's annoying that it happens at all.No more Pioneer amplification equipment for me, I fear."
1,"CNA's Exam, Question and Anwers for Long Term Care Cert","It was not very helpful for my review for the CNA state exam. The answers for every questions should be on the other page, not every after each question."
1,very poor quality,"I was very disappointed with this resource. First of all, very poor editing, very poor representation of the questions anticipated on the CNA Exam. Grammar was atrocious. Some questions were even answered incorrectly. Not anywhere near worth the price I paid for it. There are other resources available which are written by more capable, more knowledgable, and more professional people. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND purchasing this book!Advice for the author ... go back to school to develop the necessary qualifications to publish a resource book. The information you included was not professional, not helpful, and not presented professionally, as I would expect from how it is advertised."
3,Excellent Accessory for Terrible Vacuum,"The vacuum they fit is a complete piece of junk, but if you insist on continuing to use it (or somehow it hasn't broken down on you yet), these bags are what you need. And you'll need lots of them, because they're really, really small. They're kind of hard to find in the store, probably because Electrolux disowned the Intensity vacuum (model EL5020A) after having come to the realization themselves that it was terrible.There are six bags and one motor filter in the box. This product is made in China."
4,Daddy's got a brand new bag,"Hey. It's a vacuum bag. What else is there to say. It fits the Intensity vacuum and works fine. I wish Electrolux would drop the price, or a lower-cost generic version were available, but as they say, ""If wishes were horses, dreamers would ride."" Buy it, use it, clean up your life."
1,Terrible vacuum,"This machine is very difficult to use. It is heavy with large stiff wheels. If you loosen a wheel as per other reviews, it will then fall off continuously. The screw is not a slotted or Phillips, but some sort of weird hexagonal which is hard to adjust unless you have special tools. The machine is a bear to work with. The suction is great, as everyone mentions, but you can't get it where you want without much labor. I went back to my old Dirt Devil after 2 weeks of wrestling with this pig. It may be fine for large homes and deep cleaning, but horrible in apartments.The low price of $88 will make it less painful to throw out with the garbage, where it belongs."
3,beautiful but...,I really love this vac other than the fact that it is hard to push. I have only had it about a month so I think it needs o be broken in but that is about the only negative that I can find. I had readall th reviews before purchasing this and the biggest one I found was the size of the bag but honestly I have used it multiple times and the bag is still not full. It came with 10 extra bags so that was really nice. It is a really pretty vac and folds up very nicely. Overall it is a wonderful Vac. The suction is really great too.
1,Time and Again DVD,I purchased the DVD thinking it was based upon Jack Finney's excellent tale by the same name. Was I ever disappointed!
5,As good as any Go West release.,"If you're a fan of Go West then you're gonna want this one. The lead singer of Go West shows his chops in his first solo album. It doesn't take much time before you're humming the melodies to the songs. Not much longer for the lyrics either. It's probably my favorite disc that I've picked up in probably a couple of years. Try not to get too hooked on the first song or you'll never give the rest of the album much chance! I found this out the hard way. As catchy a ""pop"" song's melody as any. Pick this one up!-e"
1,Not worth the price,"Not worth the price. Very limited and out of date, if it was ever in date. Poorly written."
2,This is a slide presentation pretending it's a book,"I have never seen anything like this before. A slide presentation (with minimal notes) is all this is, folks. Very disappointing. I wouldn't have minded if there had been some useful information, but I imagine that King supplies the ""missing meat"" when he gives his slide presentation. As it stands, this book leaves me as in the dark as I began. I was hoping for some illumination (puns intended) on the workings of the energy machine. Perhaps the sparse notes included here are sufficient to an electrical engineer. To a mere lay person, the book is opaque. Too bad! I hate to write a negative review like this, since I really do support the man's work and this type of research. It's just unfortunate that this book does little to advance the cause of free energy research, in my opinion. I'm returning it."
3,inspiring in poor quality,"the book is informative and opens your mind on the subject however it is not organized pretty well, the reader has to jump across pages to make links, i don't recommend the book for people not interested in new energy topics"
4,"Good, but running out of ectoplasm","Season 4 of A Haunting was good, but you could tell they were starting to run low on story ideas. Although based on actual true stories, this is just re-enactments of what people claim happened to them.In season four, some of the shows were saddled with poor acting. It also seemed to want to use ""monsters"" rather than ghosts. Some of the stories seemd a little too far fetched to be a real ghost story like they were in earlier seasons.Although still good, and I would have liked more seasons, it's kind of a blessing the show ended on a high rather than sink to an embarrasing low."
5,Great for halloween parties,I think its the anouncer voice that make sthis show so spooky. He reminds me of the unsolved mystries guy. This season has some great episodes and since they dont show this show on tv anymore this is the only way to get em.
3,"Lots of Info, a little hard to navigate","This atlas contains tons of information in several different languages. Each page in the atlas is a different retangular section of this region, but the only key that helps orient each page in the bigger picture is a small map of the entire region in the front. It is difficult to follow, say, a certain highway across Germany without flipping back and forth to the front of the book several times. In addition, the pages are not split very well according to regions of interest - i.e. several metroplitian areas are split between two pages, and not even necessarily on successive pages. There are maps of each country in its entirety, but they are not very detailed - most don't even include the names of major highways.All in all, this is still a useful atlas with tons of information."
4,WELL ILLUSTRATED REFERENCE.,"More a picture book with some 200 photographs, than an in depth text. Nonetheless, after a brief Historical Introduction. There are ten chapters that give some insight into the talents and preferences of a flexible people.1-Interior Design,2-Crafts,3-Cuisine,4-Fashion,5-Architecture,6-Art,7-Film and Literature,8-Music and Theater,9-Invention and Sport, and 10-Travel."
4,The Voice Of Accept Rocks On,"For those who want to know what Udo has been up to since he left Accept (and came back again) this cd gives a pretty good overview of his solo carreer up until 1999. It contains classics like Heart Of Gold, In The Darkness, Independance Day, Faceless World, and Love Machine (cover song). I give it four stars because it's missing We're History, Sweet Little Child (from Mean Machine), and Blitz Of Lightning (from Facelss World). Also, I could do without another version of I'm A Rebel. For studio albums I recommend Faceless World and Holy!"
3,I've read better...,"I bought this book because I read several good reviews about it. I was disappointed with the book. I've read many, many self-help, motivating books, and this is by far is a book that I would not bother to recommend. You can find the same info in a million other books, that are written in a lest simplified, more interesting way."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR TEENS,"I see that some people think this book is TOO easy. That's what makes it so great... there's no fluff here. Everything is simple and straight to the point. I've read all Tolly Burkan's books, and this is a good intro to his life-changing insights. I have given several copies to teenagers that I know. This is a great gift to give just about anyone, but especially teens. It will help get them on the right track sooner and make the rest of their lives easier."
2,Poor Package,"This is not a good collection of Bill Cosby's best. Such a compilation is pointless for a standup comedian anyway, especially one who's original albums were so fluent & consistant. Here, you get only fractions of the classic bits, and out of context they loose much of their charm.His classic albums are a MUCH better idea. This is a disjointed listen with no flow to it."
5,Love Bill Cosby,Bill Cosby is my all-time favorite entertainer. Purchased this cd to get a taste of his old comedy routines. So hilarious! I put this cd in when I need a laugh.
3,Ennis and his duck and his 300 flies....funny,"This recording has some great one-liners and funny concepts but is lacking as a total performance. His skits do not flow into one another as well as in some of his other performances. If you are a Bill Cosby collector then buy this CD but if you want Bill at his best - then go for ""Wonderfulness"" or ""Himself."""
5,Extreme III Green 3310,"Excellent value, i especially love the design of the chain/bracelet.Going to get the Wine colour definately."
2,December stillness,"This CD was very uninspiring. The songs were alike in that each was was the same tempo, same coloration. It was very tedious to play it until the end."
1,what size,"Why can't anyone tell you the size of starter bolts???? Would it be all that difficult to say whether it is 3/8"" or 10M, what its length is, someway of knowing if the bolt would fit your application. It is a good possibility these might be the bolts I need, but no useful specifications given. I guess they want you to buy ever possible starter bolt, measure them yourself, and return those that are wrong."
3,Quality depends on the supplier,"We have an older home and rewiring doorbells was not an option. We chose instead a wireless doorbell system. It has always worked well, but the door buttons eventually will go casters up after 5 or 6 years of service. Each button uses two CR2032 batteries and, when buying a new one, it's easy to test if they work by pressing on the button through the plastic bubble pack. We ordered three (one for each door, plus a spare) from Amazon's featured vendor AntOnline. We received all three in short order, but only two worked. Problem: returning one doorbell worth $11.00 costs over $1.00 in postage. Plus, I instructed AntOnline to REPLACE the bad doorbell; instead they issued a refund. So, as I said, quality depends on the vendor. Do they test before shipping? Can they follow instructions?"
3,I love this book but...,"It's about time someone put out a book on Japanese popular music and this is a great starting point to explore. My complaints do not deal with performers that aren't covered in the book, though I would like to have seen something on Shiina Ringo or even Ayumi Hamasaki. My complaints are that almost 80% of the performers covered are no longer available on CD and that the author supplies no internet resources to purchase them."
4,It's A Time Trap!,"Prisoner Of Time is the third book in a trilogy that includes Both Sides of Time and Out of Time. However, in this book, it follows the lives of Tod Lockwood and Devonny Stratton, instead of the characters in the first book, Annie Lockwood and Strat. When Tod is up at Stratton Point refueling on its natural spring water, he is unwillingly taken by time. Once Tod realizes what has happened, he is in the year 1899. Time has dragged him here to rescue the wealthy Stratton girl. I really liked this book a lot but I was slightly disappointed in the fact that it wasn't about Annie and Strat, because I'm anxious to see what happened to them. I also hope that Caroline B. Cooney comes out with an addition to this trilogy soon! This book is great if you like Science Fiction/ Time Traveling stories with a great plotline!"
2,I didn't like it that much.,"I read both Both Sides of Time and Out of Time and was psyched when Prisoner of Time came out. I was disappointed when I learned it wasn't about Annie and Strat, but I decided to buy it anyway since the other two were so good. It was horrible! I thought it was interesting that she put Devonny and Tod together, but she should have stuck with Annie and Strat. I hope the author writes another book to this series, because I really want to know what happens to Annie and Strat."
2,Just not all there,"When I read the other two books I felt like I was there........kindof like a watcher of all that's going on, and I set myself on hearing about Annie and Strat that when I saw that it was about Devonney and Tod I was deeply disapointed and couldn't get into it as I could with the previouse two books in the series! If you read this Ms. Cooney I hope you won't keep the readers wainting too long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"It was fine, but it wasn't much, a ending to the miniseries.",The book was a page turner but I expected it to talk about what happened to Strat and Annie. I personally thought it could be much better.
3,I didn't like the fact that it wasn't about Strat and Annie.,"I was so excited when I heard that Prisoner of Time was finally out on the shelves, but then, extremely disappointed to discover that it was about Devonny and Tod. I think that more girls were able to relate to Annie because she was a modern girl. Another thing, I was really wrapped up in Strat and Annie's story, so it upset me to see that Ms. Cooney had abruptly ended their romance with only a few references to them in her latest book. I hope that she reads these comments and sees that Strat and Annie are in demand. Then, maybe, she might even consider writing another book continuing their romance, which would make many fans extremely happy!"
4,it was a good book,"Prisoner was a good book and everything but i thought it was going to be about Annie and Strat. I wanted to see if they ever ended up together or what. I'd like a book about all four of them ( Todd,Devonny,Annnie and Strat)"
3,"Certain to be good, but not as I hoped","I'm a tad older than most of Cooney's readers, but am just as disappointed by the abrupt end of Annie's story. The first two books were page turners, and there are supporting characters I'd also like a follow-up on. I don't care for the notion of Devonny in the 20th century. I'M in the 20th century! I hope Ms. Cooney will bring a satisfying end to Annie's story."
2,How Disappointing...,"I found Prisoners of Time very disappointing- I thought it was going to continue the story of Strat and Annie. Plus, I think more people related to Annie because she was from modern times. I was pretty upset when Ms. Cooney brought Tod and Devonny in Annie and Strat's series."
2,hmm...,"I loved the first two books before this one and she seems to make it a filler book. Like the author needed to get this part of the story out of the way so she could write the rest. I see how meeting each other changed Devonny and Todd, but it really was sort of a waste because Devonny ends up marrying Lord Winden anyway, and Todd...well he does whatever. and where was there father in this book? because in the next and last book it says that their parents had gotten back together, so shouldnt they have been talking in this one?"
3,I want Annie & Strat backk !,"Ok this book was alright.... I thought the point of this book was Devonny & Tod, and their romance. But then, it spent a lot of the time, focusing back on Devonny's time. This bored me greatly!!!I also didn't know what to make of Lord Windon, Devonny's fiance. In the book it was stressed that he was evil, but then towards the end it was showing a gentler side of him, so I was kind of stunned. I do admit, I wish Annie and Strat were more in this though!Also, I thought Devonny and Tod would have more of a romance. It was kind of like Tod fell in love with her, and Devonny fell in love with him. But there wasn't any words or emotions to back their statements up!! And when Devonny left, it seemed like Tod showed no emotion. I wish it was better, and I can't wait to get my romance-lovin paws on the final one!!!!!!"
3,weak for a third book,"I have read the whole series by Ms. Cooney, but to me this one's the weakest of the four. The story of Anne and Strat was going good, and then she has to bring Devonney and Tod in to the scene. But I do believe that she had her reasons. During the period, women were suppressed by male, and Devonney was way ahead of her time. It did both Tod and Devonney good to learn about the past and present(or future) and realize their potential as a human. Although it was an odd-one-out from the Quatret, it was a good read."
2,No where near as good,"This Book was definetly not as good as the first two. I very much wanted to know what happened to Annie and Strat! I also think there was too much exaggeration, It made the dawn of the 20th centurey seem more like the Dark Ages."
1,"Good book, bad ending (Beware it shows the ending)","I have never read any of the time books before, i've read the Janie books and they were good. I was completeley into the book and i thought i knew what was goingto happen but they whole thing with not putting Tod and Dev together, that just sucks and then i here how earlier annie and strat don't get together! My God, i want to see a happy ending, once and a while!"
1,not anything like the first two,"The first two were really good. This one sucked. Nothing about Annie, nothing about Strat, no true romance. The English Lord hates Devonny, only wants her money, and then when she is gone, he turns into a wonderful person? I want to know what happens to Strat. Where did he go from Spain? Did he ever make it to Egypt?"
1,Not up to expectations,"If you read the first two books of this time-Trilogy, you would have to agree that it's not much of a romantic plot and such a dissapointment for me to see that it's not at all about Annie and Strat. a true let down. The book is good but if you are looking for real romance get the first two."
1,It SUCKED SO BAD,I Loved the first two books! So I was soo excited to see the new one had come out! I bought it its frist day on the shelf. And it sucked. At first I didn't care that it wasn't about Annie and Strat. But as I read the plot line got weaker and weacker. by the end i was ready to gag. The story desperately trys to cling to the concept of the first 2 but just cant handdel it. The main Characters were just too weak!! Trust me and don't wast your time or money on this one! Stick to the good ones! AKA the first 2
3,I gave this book 3 stars cause it's not about Annie & Strat!,"I haven't read this book yet either because I am dissapointed that it isn't about Annie and Strat. The end of ""Out of Time"" was a total cliff-hanger, and I want to know who Strat ends up with! I also want to know what becomes of Annie's family! Please Ms. Cooney, you have to write another one! We all want a happy ending!"
4,This is my one-line summary. I have none.,LOOK OUT! I havent read this book yet but I was kind of disapionted when I found out that this book wasn't focused on Annie and Strat. But I look forward to reading more about the younger of the siblings. A friend told me about a new book and I couldn't wait to find out what it was. Let's have some more books about Annie and Strat!
3,?,"What do you mean, it is not a continuation of Annie and Strat!?! I mean they are the main reason why I believe romance is still alive! I have not yet been able to purchase this book(mainly because I can't find it in the book stores I'm searching in) but already reading these reviews, I'm disappointed that it's not about Annie and Strat. There should have been a reunion of somesort and satisfy our curiousity. Maybe Annie would've have fallen in love with Strat's descendant's or something. You know like how generations of their love lives on, kind of like Sweet Valley High Sagas. I loved that! If Ms. Cooney should read this, please consider making this trilogy into a quartet!"
3,It's Better if you haven't read the others.,"I admit i have not read it. Warning! if you were wondering about Annie and Strat, prepare for a bit of a let down. I am glad to see that there is more of a focus on Tod and Devonny. It would be nice to see the four reunited and live happily ever-after is a future sequal. Maybe another book on mostly Dev and Tod. In the first 2 books, Tod wasn't paid attention too enough, while dev was crucial but secondary. I'd like to see a little follow up on Bridget and Shwartz (the servant girls)."
1,What happened to Annie and Strat?,"My friend and I have waited forever for this book to find out what happened to Annie and Strat. Though the book was good, we gave a poor rating because our questions weren't answered. We sincerely hope that Miss Cooney will write another book to tell us what happened to Annie and Strat."
1,Pioneers Best,"After 3 years of ownership Pioneers Best just quit, repaire cost [is expensive].There are better Quality Equipment out there I would never ever buy another piece of Pioneer Electronic gear."
1,Specifications,"Description does not give enough information on the specifications, ie...video in/outputs, # of s-jacks, etc...."
3,pop rock fans will like it!,"ok, if you're into stuff like goo goo dolls or third eye blind, or anything pop rock-ish, this will be an excellent cd for you, in fact, i recommend it to you if you like that genre of music.BUT...if you don't like pop rock, steer clear, this isn't for you, and, unfortunatly, it wasn't for me!"
2,Sounds of Dunk,"Well, this cd isn't quite what I expected - but it's quite enjoyable. Most notable on the cd is Crowd Surfing, which is quite catchy. I think that the problem is that this group sounds a bit too much like a cross between oasis, third eye-blind and other groups of that genre of music."
4,BRIGHT PERFORMANCE!!!,"If you're a fan, this video will be great fun for you. If you're interested in rock & roll (the real one), this is a document. If you're an electric guitar player, you'll be amused and amazed!This guys really rock!!! People tend to focus in Alvin Lee, who's without any doubt a great GUITARIST (yes, with capitals), but the whole band is first class.Tom Compton has been a favorite drummer for great names such as Johnny Winter, Kim Simmons' Savoy Brown, and Robin Trower. Mick Haksworth, an amazing bass player comes from the legendary european jazz-rock band Andromeda, and latter on part of The Flying Pigs.The power of pure high-voltage rock & roll, and the performance of these guys, not only raises your pulse, but leaves you with yelling for more.PS: Mr Fine's commentaries are disrespectful by all means. His review doesn't seem written by a rock music authority, and even less by someone who loves rock & Roll. An obscure reviewer?"
2,disappointed!,"I'm a big Alvin Lee fan, but was somewhat disappointed with this DVD. Video and audio quality are average at best, and what happened to Choo Choo Mama? It's like the first 30 seconds of the song was cut off! I guess I'm just so deperate to see some good, old, live stuff that maybe I was expecting too much from this DVD. Surely there must be some good Ten Years After footage out there somewhere. This DVD just leaves a little too much to be desired........."
4,Alvin Lee's Ten Years Later - Rockpalast Live DVD,"This Is so Great! Alvin & Co Shred from start to Finish! Do not Hesitate Just Buy It, you'll Agree. I wouldve Rated it a 5 But if a show from 69 or 70 ever becomes available and is Professionaly done Im certian I'd give that a 5 cause TYA Smoked then.dd"
3,"One of rocks best guitarist,","I have seen Alvin Lee 11 times over the years live, this DVD is very poorly made, the sound is bad and the video itself is poor.It is not a complete concert and is kinda boring. The Woodstock DVD has a better"" I'm going home"" than this . But to have anything with my guitar hero will do. Plus it was made in 1978 so an up dated DVD would be better."
2,You can (usually) never go back...,"First of all, Marshall Fine (who wrote the Amazon review) needs to lighten up. He evidently writes from a strictly negative (tries to be cleverly sarcastic) perspective on Alvin Lee and wastes no time in getting in vicious hooks to trash Lee. That being said, Alvin Lee does himself no favors by participating in this DVD escapade. I prefer to listen to the CD versions from the original material and leave it at that. Lee stains his image by this release. It is sad. Some music groups from earlier days still do themselves proud, Lee is not one of them. Even guys like Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) knew when to hang up the codpiece (his hallmark of earlier days) for image more befitting his own later years and wider paunch."
2,"Just ** for the production of this DVD,not for the content!","Well, the sound is supose to be Dolby Digital 5.0 but is only kind of stereo: the rear speakers are not used almost at all.The IMAGE...what a HORROR...sometimes is like a bad TV broadcast with lines and bad pixels all over!! Sometimes is just OK.The content is amazing, one of the best concert I saw of Alvin Lee:) a must have for any fan!!I realy don't know how they could produce such a bad DVD, shame that this is the only Alvin Lee DVD available(beside the Woodstock DVD)!!"
5,Great local runner!,"Well lets start with the build quality, low on detail but theres enough where it counts! Great loco for the 6-10 yrs old range enough detail to be a big-boy train but enough durability to survive a crash unscathed. My biggest problem is the weight, theres not enough of it, poor on grades more than 5% and low hauling capacity on level track 4 Walther's 50' plugs and a caboose. Surprisingly good low speed performance for such a cheap model. For those buying this as a switcher BE WARNED! the front coupler is non-operational. So its good for branches and Local passengers, and freights.BTW if your looking for good passenger cars cheap to go with this I suggest Model Power heavyweights, cheap and durable, and come in a good ammount of road names."
3,engine,This engine had some problems. The cab or cover comes off all the time.It is not secured.The front and rear wheels are poorly designed. The rear wheels wore out quickly. The front are hard to align on the track.
4,CAREFUL- THIS IS HO not N Scale,"I either missed the scale designation or it doesn't show, but this train is HO not N scale. I am now returning it."
2,Poor quality locomotive,"Locomotive looked good but very poor design as the front leader wheels simply would not stay on the track. In addition the ""bump"" mentioned in the prior review caused the engine to derail on switches and road crossings. Not what I expected for $72.00. Returning to seller and looking for a new manufacturer."
3,Not made for old style track sets,"The train and tender seemed to be well made but someone at Bachmann didn't catch the fact that their manufacturer had added a plastic ""bump"" under the train to allow for the motor placement. This plastic dragged and ""high centered"" on all the switches on an existing train setup. When I called Bachmann's customer support manager, she was aware of the problem and suggested either I lightly file off some of the plastic to allow for the needed clearance OR exchange the engine for a different model. Apparantly, the engines with six drive wheels were the only ones designed with this problem. I opted for a different engine and returned this model to Amazon. Both Bachmann and Amazon have excellent customer service in my opinion. If you have the new style track and have no switches, there shouldn't be a problem with this engine."
1,Arrived with bent corners,it was perfectly good black posterboard but it arrived with the corner of every single one of 25 sheets bent.It didn't really matter to me b/c I was cutting it down. But they were all bent.I'm not sure how you could ship posterboard without bending the corners. But there you have it.
4,Pretty good :),"The first two chapters were made available for the public to read for free at Books-a-Million. I read them and wentback and bought the book. It is a great story, a book that is hard to put down. Some advice though, be patient with it. It can get slow at times. FOLLOW IT THOUGH TO THE END THOUGH!!! :)~"
1,Incompatible,"Bought these and tried to use them but the printer refused to recognize them. I contacted Amazon and got only platitudes. Printer broke later and so disposed of them. With all the patent protections printer manufacturers put on their printers, I have stuck to brand name cartridges since rather than deal with the incompatibilities."
4,An early release from Seduction Cinema,"Vampire's Seduction is an early release from Seduction Cinema. This short flick showcases the hot brunette erotica actress Tina Krause (aka Mia Coppia). It's filled with lesbians, bad humor and even worse acting. But it's all in good fun and I highly recommend it. Watch out for Misty's sister Chelsea, too bad she wasn't in more movies."
1,Do not waste your money on this one!!!!!!!,There is less than 2 minutes of the Vampiress. A real Dog
1,This one really bites!,"""Vampire's Seduction"" is a major disappointment from the Seduction Cinema people.... Another major problem is the lack of quality production values: this film is so poorly lit and filmed that it does the seemingly impossible by making lovelies like Tina Krause and Debbie Rochon look bad.... Hard to believe it comes from the same folks who did ""Girl Explores Girl"" and ""Mistress Frankenstein."" Skip this one!"
1,AVOID THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!,"This is a terrible ""movie."" (I hate to even call it a movie because there's no plot or storyline - forget acting.) It was shot on digital video and looks like it was done in one night. A complete waste of time."
2,Not what I expected,The book is very thin with much less detail than I expected. Also the ads for it implied there was an enclosed DVD but there was not one with the book. Very disappointed and not worth the money
4,A very good introduction to Ando's work.,"Very comprehensive with a lot of good photographs, although too many of them are monochromatic. To someone who's familiar with Tadao Ando's work it emphasizes important aspects of the architect's work such as the penetration of light and the feeling of his transcendental spaces, but to a ""novice"" it may be a little bit hard to swallow. The presentation is excellent with some additional information about the sites, time of construction etc. The last part includes instructive articles written by critics and by Ando himself. Tadao Ando's own writings are a must to anyone who loves architecture. A good book on a stupendous architect!"
3,Lumley should have given up after the first 5 books...,"which were OK, but the series just keeps going on, and on, and on, and now he's beating a dead horse."
5,Makes Dracula's Castle look like the Red Roof Inn,This book provides a description of the forementioned aeries that was not seen to this point in the series. The depth of the foreboding Lumley uses while painting his picture is galvanizing. The horror of each level is only surpassed (yet amplified) by the malevolence present in the interaction of its inhabitants. When you step back and realize that this is only one (indeed the last) in a line of larger and perhaps even more hellish structures..you really begin to appreciate the world Lumley has created and the mind from which it came.
1,"Arrived broken, still haven't shipped replacement","I ordered this for my husband for Christmas in November. The frame was not packed well & arrived broken. I have requested a replacement and sent the original back now two weeks ago and still they have not shipped a replacement. Furthermore, they have not even indicated when they will ship the replacement. Horrible. At this point I am in limbo as to whether he will have his present. Amazon shows only 4 left in stock - I wouldn't count on this company to actually get it to you in one piece. Buyer beware."
2,Storyteller,"""Failing Forward"" is mistakenly presented as the solution to overcoming hip cups in one's life. The problem is that the book retold random stories of prominent individuals from history who have finally accomplishes their goal. It fails to provide concrete tools to help move forward. Anyone can retell someone's else story."
3,Typical,This was an ok book but it got to be the same thing that you may have read else where in motivational books. Some have said this is the same as others of his.
4,Leveraging Failure into Success,"Maxwell takes the reader through a series of steps to learn and grow from the mistakes, adversity, and failures in our lives. Much of leadership development centers on professional skills, Maxwell helps the reader focus on the personal side of failures, and how failures are defining moments in our lives that either take us forward, or take us backward. The book contains many stories of successful leaders including their failures and the lessons they parlayed into success in business and life. Having experienced a series of personal failures in my own life, the book resonates with me in terms of what I have learned from those mistakes. Affirming."
4,decent stuff here,"Maxwell is a former minister and the founder of a company that offers support services to religious organizations. As such, his book's upbeat, you can do it tone may be off-putting to some. But there's some interesting stuff here and the real life examples he uses of people of have learned from failure provide some good hands-on advice. The book is organized into 15 steps that will help us make the most out of a failure. These are designed to help us 'fail forward.' Some of them include: find the benefit in every bad experience; work on the weaknesses that weaken you; change your response to failure by accepting responsibility. There's not a lot of analysis or depth to Maxwell's observations, but there's enough here in the way of examples to ground his practical observations to make this a useful motivational book."
3,"Good premise, strong beginning and ending, but weak in the middle","The idea behind this book is very original and relevant. We all make mistakes and the exploration of how to learn from those and improve ourselves is a noble task. Maxwell begins well with insightful thoughts on what failure is and is not, how success is born out of failure and how to reframe our perception of our failures. Then the book quickly turns to largely extraneous stories and weak supporting points. The book drags on in this vein for some time. It is not until near the end that things pick back up again. The book ends on a strong note, with practical suggestions of how to ""fail forward."" This book is worth reading, though be prepared to do some skimming in the middle sections."
5,Truly Inspirational,"The fundamental message behind this book that inspires me the most is the fact that we as a human being should not be afraid to fail as failure is a part of life that will teach us things that wouldn't work, and thus we would eventually know things that would work well.Perseverance is one of the essential character that should be possessed by people to fail forward. I personally believe that another character called humility should come into play in order to successfully fail forward as it puts us into a balanced perspective that we are not perfect, we need others around us, and everyone of us would go through the failure phase in order to ultimately reach our personal goals."
5,Failing Forward is a book that everyone should read!,"This book supports and encourages ""failing"" because it is an unavoidable part of life. John Maxwell teaches you how to use failure to your advantage!"
5,Great perspective on Failing,This is one great motivating book. It gives an awesome perspective on why it is accepted and necessary to fail. Most people think that doing it right all the time is the correct way to do it but that's not true and this book explains why.If you think failing is a bad thing then you need to read this. Every entrepreneur should have this on their book shelf.
