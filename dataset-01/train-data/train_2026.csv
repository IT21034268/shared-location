5,Always Entertaining!,"I love this show. I am not a fan of their newer spin off ""Ghost Hunter's Academy"" but this show never fails to entertain my family. Let's face it, there is not much out their to watch. In a world of ""Reality"" television, this one wins hands down."
5,ghost hunters,my husband is a big fan of ghost hunters watches the show every wed. now he owns the collection and loves it and is happy he can watch and rewatch
1,What a waste of money!,"Honestly, if I could give this ZERO STARS I would. Don't waste your time or money.This show should have been cancelled several years ago as it has really gotten boring. People always write how exciting the so-called 'big reveal' is at the end of the show. What big reveal? All that's ever talked about are personal experiences and noises that were heard!!! Needless to say, their 'evidence' is ALWAYS crap. Find something better to do with your time! WATCH GHOST ADVENTURES AND SEE THE REAL THING!"
5,"Twas the Night Before Christmas, Best Christmas show ever!","I used to watch Twas the Night Before Christmas all every year when I was a kid. It brought back so many memories of my childhood watching. My neice loved it also, so its great to start new memories with her. Honestly I watch it even though it is no longer the Christmas season."
4,Wonderful Christmas Stories!!!,"Frosty Rules of Course!!! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the stupid trailers for other shows.As far as I'm concerned there should not be trailers of other shows on any specific DVD period! Otherwise, these are Great Christmas Classics!!!"
3,"Two specials: One good, one bad","I always felt that ""Frosty the Snowman"" was not near the top of the ladder of all Rankin-Bass holiday specials. So a sequel would of course be much lower, and that adequately describes ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland."" Besides being ho-hum all the way around, this one isn't even Christmas-themed, so I'm trying to figure out why anybody would go out of their way to watch it.""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" also is included here, although it gets second billing which to me is a mistake. This is perhaps the most unsung and overlooked of the best Rankin-Bass specials, with lots of heart and very good music (""Even a Miracle Needs a Hand"" is one of the best songs in Rankin-Bass history). On its own it probably would rate higher.Another negative is that the DVD has absolutely no extras. Why don't ""making of"" specials exist for the extensive Rankin-Bass library? Would love to see something like that."
3,not the original,"i bought this movie just to get the ""twas the night before christmas"" movie that is included, so i really wasn't looking for a new frosty story. my nephew enjoys it though."
3,Ok.....,"frosty is really good. it's a classic!i hate watching twas the night before christmas.it's all about clocks and mouses and liers.if i were you, i would buy frosty alone, not twas the nightbefore christmas. rankin/bass has never dissapointed me before,except with this movie! these 3 stars go towards frosty."
4,Frosty's Winter Wonderland DVD Set,Excellent product! I grew up watching these classics on TV at Christmas each year and it's nice to now have them in my own collection for my nieces and nephews to view when they visit me. The quality is excellent and the collector's case is very nice also. Worth the price paid when I see my siblings' children enjoying the same classics I grew up watching.
2,Frosty's Winter Wonderland ~ NO!,"Frosty's Winter Wonderland is definitely a bad decision! It takes away from the classic Frosty the Snow Man, in a bad way. Twas the Night Before Christmas is good. Just buy the Twas the Night Before Christmas and skip Frosty's Winter Wonderland to save a buck."
5,Brings back great memories...,"When I was little, I remember watching Twas the Night Before Christmas on one of the major networks.It stuck with me for 20 years before I finally found this dvd. And even though I'm older, I still cherish this cartoon for reminding me that you don't have to be a kid to enjoy cartoons!"
3,'Twas the Night Before Christmas,"I don't know about Frosty's Winter Wonderland, but I'm buying this for 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, alone! I've been waiting for that one to come out on DVD."
3,"Good historically, but what about now?","I have learned quite a bit from the book, but it disappointed me in that it's mostly a history of the Rasta movement in the 1960s & 1970s, and doesn't really tell you much about what's going on wih the Rastas today. Most of the parts describing ""present day"" phenomena were obviously written at least 20 or 30 years ago, which I find a bit sloppy, if not misleading, from the editor's part. Also, the author seems to be struggling a little too hard to impress the academic world with fairly unnecessary references to unrelated authors. It has been entertaining and informative, but certainly not the definitive book on Rastafarianism I was expecting."
1,False advertisement,"Cardiris's software has problem exporting all information to Outlook, contrary to what they advertise. Their technical support is very slow in responding (they would not pick up the phone, and would not respond to your message sometimes for days), incompetent (constantly answering the wrong questions), and eventually they blame Outlook for the imcompatibility. If you buy their product not directly from their website, they will not refund you although the problem arises from their own false advertisement and their slowness in admitting it so you pass the period so that you can not return their product to the vendor that you purchased from. Be prepared for a long technical troubleshooting battle with them, and be aware that you may not get your money back even after they admit that their software can not do what they claim."
1,"No errors, Poor accuracy","I had no problems with installation or errors when scanning.The results of the scans were very poor. Its supposed to take the information scanned from the card and fill out corresponding fields, it accomplished this with something like 10% accuracy. That makes it easier to use a different program to manage the information and type it in yourself."
1,"Zero ""customer support""","I received a free copy of this software with my Fujitsu ScanSnap (a great product, BTW). The Cardiris software wouldn't activate. After 10+ emails and webform posts, no response. Some months later I purchased a business card reader and...you guessed it...another copy of Iris' software that, yup, didn't work.I am a very skilled computer user, and have interacted with numerous customer service departments over the past 30 years. Most are not very helpful, but these guys are the WORST. They appear to have absolute contempt for anyone stupid enough to have purchased, or otherwise gotten stuck with, any of their software products.My advice: avoid all of their products."
2,CardIris Sucks,"1. CardIRIS 3 is error prone2. It lacks the ability to Scan a two sided card.3. The OCR is really poor.4. It's ability to determine fields is sorry, you might find the address in the Company Name Field or the Company Name in the Contact Name Field, etc.5. I have not figured out how to add Fields such as additional Phone NumbersThe only advantage CardIRIS 3 has over my CARDSCAN 6.0.6 is CardIRIS is in Color."
1,The Harris Hawk: Management Training and Hunting,"International Falconer magazine gave this book a rare poor review. Why would and American buy a book about and Training American hawk, written by a British falconer? The book contains a map of where Harris Hawks are supposed to live in the wild. He's way off. International Falconer says the author doesn't even train Harris Hawks. For a much better book try, Desert Hawking with a little help by Harry McElroy!"
4,Great Book,The information given in this book is written in a manner that is easy to follow and quite detailed in respect to anyone wishing to pursue this venture.
3,Sweet story.,"This book was okay, not my favorite though! I thought the illustrations were very good! I use picture books with my middle school students to help them make inferences and make predictions."
4,Good clean Jazz fun...,"This is such a great CD to put on if you're going to clean the house or wash the car in the driveway... perfectly safe to turn up loud as it has an extremely high (near 100%) approval rating and joy factorif you can't enjoy this recording session... you're broken inside..(in other words: seek help)what it is:a series of medium speed slightly funky grooves (with a few ballads) that never fail to entertain. This is a kind of ""zero dissonance"" playful jazz that lifts the soul and brightens the mood... Again: The grooves are happy beats - the solo work is solid, active and upbeat with a kind of easy going confidence that can be had only from jazz masters, everybody can really play...a must have for any musical collection..."
3,tight Jam session,"I enjoyed the Groove element involved here between Less Mcann,Jimmy Smith,Joe sample,Ray Brown&others. Quincy Jones knows how to Assemble&Brings folks together.I dug the Soloing&Riff exhanges but some of the Material didn't get a full kick.but the cats playing Grooved though."
3,Hikky Burr!,"This music was recorded forThe Bill Cosby Show. This was a show where he played a bachelor gym teacher, not the more famousThe Cosby Showwhere he played a married doctor. The music was produced by Quincy Jones. The original master tapes for these sessions have been lost, so this album uses whatever tapes were available, with most of these recordings being alternate takes. These are jazz-funk jams, which are pretty groovy. The biggest treat for me was hearing Cos scat the show's theme song, ""Hikky Burr"". Interestingly, Cosby released ""Hikky Burr"" as a single back in 1969, but that is a different version than the one featured here."
3,A moose adna bearll,"The Morris and Boris books are another set I was introduced to by my husband and his family. I personally don't enjoy them as much as either the Frog and Toad series by Arnold Lobel or the George and Martha series by James Marshall. Morris and Boris's friendship doesn't make any sense in this book. They never seem to like each other and they are always arguing.In Morris and Boris at the Circus, Morris decides to join the circus. Before the Ringmaster will hire him he has to prove himself during a show. Boris tries to help Morris do a variety of things (acrobat, lion tamer, performing dog, etc.) and he fails horribly at each task. Part of Morris's problem is he's an idiot and a lot of story is wasted on Boris having to explain things to Morris repeatedly. Morris does finally succeed at the expense of Boris. You can probably guess how."
2,low quality,"Upon first shot the whiskers flew out of the biscuit. Also the plastic is flimsier than expected. It's not the sellers fault, it's the manufacturer..."
3,Wrong size,Product great Wrong size. Actual size medium covered up with a size small sticker. Size small is what I was ordered.
5,"Works well, I made a sling shot bow with it.",I zip tied this to a sling shot so I could fire arrows through it. It works well at close range. You will need to glue the inner ring down before firing it.
1,Terrible after-taste and smell!,"These ruined my dinner. I bought these croutons for a special poultry dish. The croutons smelled ""off"" when I first open the bags (I bought two), but I didn't think anything about it. However, when I tried a couple, they left a really bad after-taste. The expiration date was okay; I thought maybe it was just a different type of seasoning and proceeded to use them in my dish.However, when I served my guests, some took a few bites and didn't touch it again, filling up on the bread and side dishes. After one bite, I was disgusted with the taste, which was definitely the croutons, but much more potent--they took over the dish! I took the unused portion of the 2nd bag and took it back to the grocery store for a refund. I must have gotten a bad batch, but won't buy them again."
5,Excellent-Should appeal to all Charlie Chan fans.,"This is an excellent set of six movies made in the late 30's and early 40's starring Karloff as detective Mr. Wong (except in the last movie which stars Keye Luke as Mr. Wong). The first movie was actually remade as the Charlie Chan film ""Docks of New Orleans"". The quiality is very good and I would recommend this series to any Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto fan. Very entertaining."
3,OVERPRICED,"This set is good, but not worth what Amazon is charging. At the Big O I paid a quarter of this price. In fact, all the Roan titles the Big O carries are at a significant discount from Amazon."
4,You cannot go Wong with Boris Karloff,"If Peter Lorre (Rosenberg, Austria-Hungary [now Ruzomberok, Slovakia]) can be Mr. Moto ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939),"" then Boris Karloff (Camberwell, London, England, UK) can be Mr. Wong.Actually, these six films are quite entertaining. I paid a little less, but they were on VHS. The DVDs being a set will save on shipping. They may last a little longer also. So put on your thinking hat and buy the set."
2,Wong Pwice....!,Ya Can Get All Six Mr. Wong Films For Free @ Prelinger Film Archive/Films/Mr. Wong/............Don't Pay Those Rip-Off Morons..! The Grande Kazoo Has Spoken..
1,Not usable,"I had purchased this item for xmas (12/06) and to date (05/07) the website has not been created to download the instructions. The product is very cute and the radio works but until the website is created you cannot use the mp3 player. Would not recommend this item, unless you are looking for a mini-radio."
4,The Plates are the thing...,"As the title of this book suggests, the subject matter isprimarily reproductions of many ladies fashion plates from the higheststyle journal of the English Regency. Sadly, too few of the plates are reproduced in color, however, the editorial choices made by Stella Blum (at one time curator of the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Collection) about which plates to reproduce, and which ones to print in color are intelligent, and her brief essay of introduction is highly informative. This book is a must for people wanting to see what Regency Fashion looked like, or for people who wish to identify Fashion Plates. People who need a more through text on the subject should also buy ""Jane Austen : In Style"" by Susan Watkins, Hugh Palmer. People who want guidance on how to make these clothes should also seek out ""Federalist & Regency Costume : 1790-1819"" ed. by R.L Shep. END"
5,Good source,Well done illustrations with enough detail to be a help to the costume maker as well as the casual viewer.
5,The Best of Capstick,"Having read all of Capstick's books. I think this one ranks at the top. Wally Johnson had an extremely interesting life. Capstick writes the book as if they are having a conversation. Wally has many grest stories and Capstick injects his own observations on each subject. This book, especially the first half is probably the best Capstick ever. I have read this book many times and never tire of it. A definite must read for anyone interested in Africian adventure."
5,Old Africa,"This is a book that takes the reader back to the Africa of old.. This is the Africa of the great white hunter. Capstick tells the story of the last of the great hunters, Wally Johnson a man's man. This is one of the best of the entire Capstick collection. A book that is a must read for anyone who loves Africa"
5,Great entertainment,This is a wounderful addition to my Africana library. It is interesting how the stories are told in the words of both Capstick and Wally Johnson.
4,mmmmmmmm....nice,"It's beautiful. Arrived fast. Installed quick. Only one side comment regarding water. Without putting a liner in, it can 'seep' with water where it touches the tub. Just make sure that the magnets are working and that all the curtain is on the inside of the tub. No seeping. We were using it with a transfer chair and where the curtain had to lay on one part of the chair, it would seep water on the floor. Not really the curtains fault. But without the chair, it worked fine."
5,It may be small town LA EMS but it is really EMS Everywhere,I read a lot of this type stuff and this is one of the better ones. No he is not on Boston EMS or FDNY but he tells it like it is and I really like the unique format of the book. Short stories with what he is really thinking in italics. The book is a little pricey but for the money a real bargain.
3,NOT SURE,WE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO HELP MY HUSBAND WHO WAS EXPERIENCING SOME HEALTH ISSUSES. AND FIRST FEW TIMES THAT HE TOOK ONE IT CAUSED HIS HEART TO RACE AND HE FELT NAUSES. BUT AS HE CONTINUED TO TAKE THEM HE OVERCAME THE SIDE EFFECTS HOWEVER I AM NOT SURE THAT HE HELPED HIS HEALTH ISSUES AT ALL.
3,"Cute Shirt, but very cheaply made.","I ordered this for my niece for Christmas, I ordered the medium. When the shirt arrived it was a lot smaller than I expected and it was a very thin material, almost see-through. Also since it was a very small shirt I was very surprised at how much they charged for the shipping. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I loved the movie and the artwork on the shirt was very good."
5,"Engaging, Enlightening, Excellent!","An engaging, enlightening and throughly entertaining Bible, especially for teens or adults who wish a fresh, new perspective when reading the Old and New Testaments. The chronological format, expansive, introductory overviews ( providing rich revealing historical backdrops of the Biblical texts), excellent charts, timelines and footnotes, offer readers ... both the scholarly, familiar with the Bible, and novice ... a fresh, appealing reading experience. This Bible is divided into nine epochs, and each stands alone in detailing brief glimpses into 'Geography & Environment, Arts & Literature, Religion & Worship, Cultlure & Society, Beliefs & Ideas, Politics & Government, as well as a comprehensive concluding Index of Scripture Passages and Cultural & Historical Topics. An excellent first Bible or simply a companion Bible that invites new interest on a timeless book."
4,A Bible that chidren can better understand,My 5th grade son uses this bible for his bible class and it makes more sense to him and me. It was teacher recommended. The bible is not in book order but chronological order. This may seem like an obstacle but there is an index to look up the books of the bible so it is still easy to locate information.
5,WONDERFUL!,"Chronilogical order really helps for getting things in order that they happened in your mind. Everything about a certin act is all together yet tells you what scripture it is. There is a index in the back of the book if you want to look up where any scripture is. The notes are really nice, you learn avout life at that time."
4,So that's why Bible,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas , she was asking for it . My hubby saw it and really liked it so same daughter got him one. I haven't had a chance to really look it over good , but they like it so there ya go."
5,Talking Heads mixed in North Africa,A very well known Italian Singer/Songwriter - Singing in his own Genovese dialect - With strong influences from across the Mediterr. David B of Talking Heads would like this one!
2,incredibly...,"HORRIBLE! wow...I bought this after hearing ""Body and Blood"" thinking ""yeah it's a little bit of a Phil anselmo rip off"" and I was OK with that, seeing that Pantera are my favorite band. I think this albums biggest downfall is the singers attempts at clean vocals, he sounds like he's constipated. The music gets boring after a while if you can even see past the horrendous vocals to get that far. Download ""Body and Blood"" it's the only stand-out track. Next please!"
3,"Okay, Needs better guitarist","The vocals on this album are great. This guy sounds a lot like Phil Anselmo. Most of the songs are based upon vocals, and that's a weakness. Another mistake that A Perfect Murder made, is saying that they can be compared to Pantera or Metallica. This guitarist is at the bottom of the list compared to Dimebag Darrell, or Kirk Hammett. Get a new guitarist!!!"
2,Slightly Above Suck,"Someone said earlier that when you album sports a sticker comparing you to pantera & metallica, you had better back it up. Well, this donesn't.There are definately some killer riffs, but I picked out quite a few blatent pantera rip-offs, the main riff for the song ""Wake up and die"" is almost exactly the same as the verse riff or pantera's""Living Through Me"".Had I previously been able to hear the album in it entirety, i most definatly wouldn't have paid any money at all for it.The vocals are absolutely an obvious Phil Anselmo rip off, the lead work is a different story though.The guitar solos are damn HORRIBLE. The guy shouldn't even bother. It sounds like a 6 year old who's only played for a week tried to play them. Spare yourself the $15 and go buy a 5th of Jack Daniels instead. I guarantee you'll have more fun with that."
1,Jumbled Mishmash,"Poor clone of Doom. Bad controls, bad information, bad lighting, unimaginative story. Maybe it gets better, but after 30 min I decided life was too short for this game."
4,Very Scary,This game is much scarier then anything I have played well of course until Doom 3 comes out. The noises and the atmosphere it creates is very intense. The zombies and creatures move extremely fast so you have to be on your toes. I have never seen water look as amazing as it did on this game with it dripping across the tv screen. The boat rocking back and fourth on the raging sea made you feel like you were at the seas mercy. When you fall you slide to the edge of the boat and you can pull yourself right back up! While shooting at zombies you can hold onto a rail and shoot so you can get a good shot. The controls are a little crazy at first but once you figure it out it is very addicting! I wish the boss fight at the end lasted longer it was very intense! I just hope this title is not kicked to the side by all these other games coming out it is a great game.
2,Problems of Cold Fear,"Cold Fear looks like a really fun game, and probably is! I don't know for sure because I can't play it. I can't play Cold Fear because it is NOT supported on the Xbox 360 console. If you have an original XBOX console, Cold Fear would be an excellent purchase. However, if you have an Xbox 360 console of any kind, Cold Fear will not work on it. It is one of the few original XBOX titles that won't work on Xbox 360."
3,Feels like they realeased the game too soon.,"I really enjoyed the game. It feels a lot like playing Resident Evil when you are running around in the game. When you shoot you hit a button to enter a first person mode which makes shooting easier. I liked the enviroment a lot, it was spooky being on the boat. The game did make me jump a few times as well. However the characters were poorly developed story mode wise. They do give a basic gist of what is going on but leave out enough information to make you crave more. Also I found to game to be short. I beat the game within a couple days and that's because I'm not that good with video games. I enjoyed the game but wish they had done so much more with it."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Don't even think of buying this collection-while they list some of the 60's greatest hits ever; luckily I heard a few samples-ALL ARE NEW REMAKES!!! These are not, REPEAT, NOT, the original recordings done in the 60's. Not even the same arrangements either. A waste of your time and money! You'll find several collections of 60's tunes, just look carefully!"
3,Mediocre amount of input,Definitely would love to hear more Portuguese. Too many sequences where there are no words said at all.
4,Very good beginning Spanish book - Fun to learn,"Along with my tutor, using this book has made me want to learn and the way the educational materials are presented are logical and challenging."
3,Textbook,The textbook was a little more used than expected. All pagesare in tact. So the textbook is usable. It was a good deal.
1,"""All selections are new stereo recordings"" says it all!",No original recordings. I find it hard to believe that they got all of the original members of these bands back together 21 years later to rerecord. No comparison to the originals. The description should have the same disclaimer the CD does. Severely disappointing. Stick with Billboard. They use all original recordings (that's why they cost twice as much). Two thumbs down )-:
4,Not Disappointed,"Have had this unit for a couple of months now. I am using it with a 47"" Akai rear projection 1080i monitor. I am totally satisfied with the quality of the picture it delivers. I did not have many choices as the Akai is an earlier model with only component inputs. I do have a couple of minor complaints. 1. When I reverse the movie I have to hit stop, then play to interrupt the reverse mode. 2. When you pause the movie, then hit play, the sound gets out of sync. You have to hit stop, then play to get it to sync up again. These are minor inconveniences. I am not sorry I bought it."
4,Does 1080i upscaling over component video out!,"This is one of the few players that does HD upscaling of DVDs for HDTV-ready TVs (and also LCD projectors) which work over HD component video inputs (HDCVI) but lack HDMI sockets.It works very well, plays MPEG4 (XVID / DIVX) movies as well.The downside? it doesn't show long filenames while browsing CD-R / DVD-R data disc contents. Also, MP3 playback and the file navigation interface could use some work.On the positive side, it features a ""hard"" power button, in other words, it's a switch in the back that cuts the power to the unit completely, that's unheard of in today's world of ""always on"" electronics. Not only it includes Composite video, S-VIDEO, HD COMPONENT VIDEO outs, but also a VGA OUT port!. The remote is really nicely sized (big) and its keys glow in the dark."
4,Very Inspiring!,"Great read, very inspiring to hear their story! If you are from the ""finished work of the cross"" or ""grace"" camp (John Crowder, Ben Dunn, Georgian Banov, etc.) like I am, you may find some of the theology in the last two chapters a bit frustrating which is why I only gave it four stars. But I did give it 4/5 because I thoroughly enjoyed and was inspired!"
4,"Great book, great service",This is a fantastic little book that is connected to an article in a recent Christianty Today. Encouraging to all Christians.
3,Always Enough,"I truly believe there is always enough when God is in it. I am fascinated by the Bakers. However, the book was too vague for me. Needed items poured in. But from where? They raised $$ to go where needed. How?"
2,A Banal Booklet,"Not much substance to this 'book.' States and restates the obvious between a bunch of short, randon, anecdotes. Provides no practical advice - let alone insight - that would help parents."
3,ESTE LIBRO ES LA REPETICION DE LOS OTROS LIBROS,"ESTE LIBRO NO FUE ESCRITO POR DON MIGUEL SINO Por Mary Carrol Nelson ella es estudiante de Don miguel ruiz y el libro se trata de lo que ha aprendido , me parecen Mas Interesantes los otros , escritos por Don Miguel no por sus alumnos ."
5,"Author Booth breaks back, spirit in attempt to convey music","Stanley Booth has always sacrificed something for his work; whether it's his health or his sanity or his relationships but never his sense of humour. Rythm Oil takes its shape as an overview of Memphis, living on through yellow fever and famine, the death of all its musical heroes, who as it happened, came to Memphis and died there or who were born there and who left never to return. Even Booth, who today lives in Georgia, his home state, can't seem to find it in his heart to repudiate this strange and fascinating town with its greasy river that recently claimed another musical hero, Jeff Buckley. Memphis is a town of contradictions: its streets run north-south and its avenues run east-west, something Priscilla Presley never knew. ""It's like she lived in a cocoon,"" remarks Booth, talking to his mother who replies ""She did, it was on top of her head."""
5,Chilling to the Bone,I'm about forty pages away from finishing Flicker as I write this...I had to take a break...never before have I been scared to finish a book. The previous reviewers have provided excellent description which does not need duplication...this is truly one of the great works of American fiction.
3,"A good supplement to his earlier books, but not a primer","This is not a good first book on camera repair, a distinction which has to be noted in contrast to his first book which is far more suitable as a primer. For the somewhat experienced phototechnician working on the classics covered in this book, it's a useful title. I would start with either his first two titles (Camera Maintenance and Repair 1 and 2),the classic Ed Romney text (Trade Secrets:Basic Training in Camera Repair), or if you can find them the old National Camera correspondence materials.That said, given the proliferation of specific books he has produced, they are informative and useful within their scope."
5,Adorable!,This was a Christmas gift for my friend who is the proud mommy of pugs. She just loved this tote purse!
1,Couldn't get over the problems.,"I'll admit it's been a couple of months since I tried to read this, but I remember quite vividly the problems that made it impossible to finish. Spelling errors on every page. Butchering certain phrases by using the wrong word or the wrong form of a word, thus completely changing the meaning of the phrase. There was no attachment to any of the characters who die right off the bat, and I just couldn't ever fully sink into the story because of the technical errors. Much as I was looking forward to liking the novel, the style seemed off and by the time I reached the end of the second chapter, I gave up trying to make it through the book."
4,Not a bad effort you have a new fan,"This is a book that should tickle any horror fans fancy. Although there were a few errors that I found in the book (not every page like the last reviewer would want you to believe) there's no more than I've seen even in bestsellers, and the story was very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to receiving Kevin's latest novel, I have to see whats in store for us now. I am proud to have Kevin's book on my shelf, and it will remain there until I'm ready to read it again. This one is a keeper!"
4,Perry Masob-The third Season,"For a show this old, the quality is very good. Even the audio is above average. The black and white recording is very clear. Thanks, Paul"
2,Defective DVD,"I started this DVD with the first episode, and in the middle it stopped and could not be read by my DVD Player. I'm sure it is not my DVD player because I have had no problems with other DVD's."
1,Refuse to buy!,"I love the Perry Mason shows. However I refuse to pay for a half season at these outrageous prices. I have given up the idea of seeing or owning the Perry Mason DVDs unless the price gouging stops. Signed, disgruntled Perry Mason fan."
3,"Great episodes, inconsistent packaging","I wonder what the morons at CBS-Video are thinking when they decide to package a season one way and another season a different way. All they think about is the pennies they could save on each unit so their CEO's can earn salaries that nobody is really that good to earn. How about a little pride in the product you put out!? It would have been 5 stars for the episodes, but the packaging sucks."
5,Della Street....no~ Perry Mason!!!,"I think Della Street was inlove with Perry Mason.Oh I just thought they were so wonderful together,and of course that handsome Paul Drake.There will not be a better Lawyer TV show thanPerry Mason...not ever~"
5,Review of the Perry Mason season 3 vo. 2 DVD,This rating was choosen because the DVD that I ordered was in very good condition. I liked it very much. I was surprised that I was able to find it at all.
1,Boy Scouts 101,"If this is intended as a training DVD with visual intructions how to build a fire, move rocks and climb over fallen trees it has accomplished its purpose. I found it boring and extremely slow paced. There is no talking. The action - if you can call it that - is painfully tedious. The only reason I continued to watch this horrific film to the end is it was with hopeful anticipation that there must be some exciting scenes forthcoming. They never materialized and this was a HUGE waste of time. I have never been so extremely disappointed with any purchase - until now! Not only will this never be viewed again but is the very first DVD I have ever thrown in the trash. Don't waste your money."
1,0/10,"Whoo boy! What a badly thrown-together load of rubbish!If you enjoy ponderous shots of badly video-taped, uninspiring men wandering aimlessly through equally badly videoed backdrops, here's one just for you.Sadly, even the case containing this shoddy production (and I use the term ""production"" under extreme duress!) is not worth the plastic it's wastefully made from.Nil for effort.Don't waste your time :)"
5,A Fabulous Collection of Michael Parkes' Paintings,"I am a big fan of Michael Parkes' paintings. They are captivating because of the way the surreal imagery is blended with a realistic landscape. The earth tones mixed with the fantastic are breathtaking. His color usage is what makes me love his paintings. This book is a great collection of some of his best works. (There were, however, only a few of my favorite paintings missing, like Unwinding, Moonstone and The Old Ways) The best thing about this book is that it is up-to-date with the latest paintings as of 1998! Each painting comes with some words to help get a better understanding of it. It's not a wordy book, which puts the focus on the paintings where it belongs. Parkes' paintings have struck me deeply ever since I discovered this brilliant artist. If you have liked Parkes' artwork and you are trying to find an up-to-date collection of his paintings, then this is the right book for you and it is well preserved in hard cover!"
5,A Must Have for Michael Parkes fans,"This is a magnificent book. The large illustrations and text that accompany them are beautiful to look at and insightful. We all interpret his work in our own way, it's nice to see how the artist himself interprets his work. I have several of his books and like them all, but this is my favorite."
2,could be improved,"The case itself is nice, but the single belt loop is too narrow (it wobbles) and the stitching started seperating after only two outings. I think it could be forcibly ripped from my belt."
5,A terrific read,"This book, written by my husband, Bill Hoover, is tops on style and content. I recommend it without reservation."
4,Great book for CBT focused Clinicians,The book is solid and practical! The information is very useful in its applications and techniques in the therapeutic process when working with clients! I really enjoy the examples of CBT focused techniques used within this book. I use this book when I work with clients in order to develop treatment plans and utilizing CBT techniques. This is a great foundation in learning CBT for evidence based practice in psychotherapy!
2,Boring and NOt worth it.,"You're better off learning from other sources. Do your research before buying this book. I sold it and got some money back, but you may not be so lucky . . . ."
1,Tries to do too much and fails completely,"This is a terrible book. It is neither good for learning ASP.NET or learning Web DB application development. The author is not all that knowledgeable about .NET. He makes some completely wrong claims like where he says roles are not used in forms based security or .NET can't do comparisons against null (he means DB field nulls but doesn't make that clear). A third of the book itemized code ""the 17 steps to upload a file are..."" Just padding. Put in the relevant code and refer to the source on the CD.If you want to build web DB apps with ASP.NET and ADO.NET, first get a book on ASP.NET which will include some ADO.NET anyway, then, when you master that, get an ADO.NET book. And get a book on VB.NET or C#, whichever you prefer."
4,Is a new edition due soon?,"This was very helpful book, full of examples. I like the writer's style, which is concise and moves right ahead. However, I wish that Jim used an increasingly popular method to reference the code-- with colored numbers or something to help call out which line he was explaining. His explanations got bogged down a bit by the way he referenced his own code blocks. Visually beefing this up, would have been welcomed.I found his brief notes and tips to be useful advice- delivered from an experienced programmer to a beginning to intermediate coder. The majority of these were useful points. Authentiction and ADO stuff was good, but I needed more sources as well.It took me some effort to find this MSPRESS edition. I do hope that MSPRESS hasn't discontinued this and that a new revision is in the works. Reccomended."
2,"Should start slower, reference material should be separated","I really loved chapter 1. Chapters 2 and 3 had way too much reference material without opportunity to use it. I was trying to memorize too much detail. Many things were mentioned with the idea they would be elaborated on later. They could've been saved for later. I'm only on Chapter 4 but I am really struggling to keep going and I have read many books like this cover to cover. Because I do not do development in my current role this is a very challenging book for me. I look forward to getting to later chapters but it is rough going. I like that examples are Access based, not SQL server-based."
2,SOON TO BE 1ST HAND EXPERIENCE,"HE IS NOW A FUGITIVE FROM THE LAW FOR KILLING HIS WIFE, SO IF HE DOES NOT KILL HIMSELF FIRST, THEN HE CAN WRITE HIS NEXT BOOK FROM BEHIND BARS."
4,Exciting Read,This book really is amazing! I can not believe how different the movies change the truth. The author really did a great job getting these people to talk!
1,"""Never Received""",Received only a portion of my merchandise. Seller assured me that the other DVD was forthcoming which never came. I didn't appreciate being sent on a wild goose chase when the seller knew that the merchandise was never sent. Don't know if I'll recommend or use this seller again.
5,perfectly frank,"loved this series as a kid and it was good to see an old friend,frank cannon! this is great! just to see the old cars and some of the styles of the 70's was great to see again. the quality of the dvd is very good i gave it five stars because the audio and the video was top notch. i highly recomend this to anyone. i'm going to purchase season 2 next so i can continue to be on the job with frank."
4,The 70's Personified,"This show is a great example of 1070's popular culture. From the far-out plots to the funky hairstyles and clothes to the big Detroit cars with velour upholstery, this series can't be beat. And William Conrad as Frank Cannon is icing on the cake! He definitely doesn't fit the normal image of a suave, handsome private eye like Mannix. Just a plump guy who's on top of everything and is quite athletic to boot. You will enjoy every minute of these well-produced DVD's."
4,Great Classic Series,"This is one of the best series of the '70s. My only complaint is Paramount didn't remaster the episodes. However, they look quite nice played on my HDTV with a Blu-Ray/Upconverting DVD player. The best thing Paramount could do is start remastering all their classic TV shows on Blu-Ray Disc. I've heard the original Star Trek looks terrific on Blu-Ray."
3,Something is Missing,I am a huge fan of the series and own the other VHS tapes. I had a hard time watching this one. It seemed that I could not stay awake. I attempted to watch it two times (on different days) and both times I fell asleep. I watched it a third time and actually managed to stay awake (only barely).
5,An excellent CD set to enjoy and share,"Fun With Teachers: Music For The Classroom: Volumes 1 & 2 is an impressively produced and wonderfully ""kid friendly"" two-cd set filled with excerpts from classical music composed by Bach, Mozart, Vivaldi, Handel, and other great geniuses. With each piece carefully selected specifically appropriate for young listeners, Volume 1 compositions were chosen specifically to develop concentration; while Volume 2 offers music to help young ones calm down and relax. An excellent CD set to enjoy and share, featuring themes with appeal that has withstood the test of time, the Fun With Teachers: Music For The Classroom series is an enthusiastically recommended addition to family, preschool, classroom curriculum, school and community library CD music collections for children."
1,New candidate for Worst Book I've Ever Bought,"Unreadable tripe. This fellow actually made a living writing? Unbelievable. Cardboard characters, no real hero, no sex worth mentioning, strictly awful."
4,Killer death metal EP,"DC area melodic death metal band Age of Ruin followed up their 2002 EPAutumn Lanternswith another EP in 2003, titled The Longest Winter's Woes. With this EP, the band continues to perfect their brand of At the Gates inspired melodic death metal. They also seem a bit harsher and more aggressive with this offering (sort of likeSkydancerera Dark Tranquillity), and have the potential to appeal to hardcore/metalcore fans as well as death metal fans.All told, The Longest Winter's Woes is another impressive release by a band that deserves far more attention from the metal community. If you like At the Gates, Soilwork, In Flames, and Hypocrisy, you need to check out Age of Ruin.s, Soilwork, In Flames, and Hypocrisy, you need to check out Age of Ruin.The track listing is as follows:1. the Harlequin's Kiss2. the Silver Tongues3. Dimmer4. Passage of Winter's Woes5. the Crimson Fails Forever6. Bleed For Better Days"
3,Lots of ads...,"I'm not sure how much use the average person would get out of this magazine. It is sort of nice to read if you are dreaming about retiring, but the actual information is more extensive and useful on the internet. Try findyourspot.com instead and save the $18 for six issues of advertisements. If you are looking for retirement communities, it might be worth subscribing or just buying one issue at the news stand."
3,"Somehow, this was not particularly good","I was hoping for more in-depth articles than what I got here. The towns listed were mostly resort-types, and there was far less on living in regular places where one might retire and live on a fixed income. I think I expected more from ""Where to Retire"" than I got out of my subscription, so I didn't renew."
2,Lacks Content and Depth,"I used the subscription for one year.None of the 'Retirement recommendations' had enough depth, pictures or information.The articles rarely told you where you could get additional information, and if they did, they usually only listed one source.The articles do not consistently tell you about the benefits/penalty of retiring in a particular area, as I hoped they would. In other words I wanted to see each article include information about taxes for retirees (do they tax Pensions ? social security? State taxes for those over 65 ? Property tax reductions ? Homestead exemptions ? ...)If you know what region of the country you are interested in, you might be better off grabbing a couple of regional magazines to help you find locations that fit your needs or meet your criteria. Then do some online research. The retirement suggestions in this magazine are all over the place, and all over the financial budget.The magazine is filled with lots of sales and advertisements."
2,A bit too dated,"I haven't read much on options, but wanted a book about trading options (with all complexity that involves). This book feels a bit dated. It does a fair job describing different strategies; straddles, butterflies, etc. But it doesn't do a good job describing different technical measures. It does cover the put-call ratio, but you do not get a feel for how useful the measure is. Implied volatility is hardly covered at all and ditto for VIX. That is just not acceptable. Note that this is a second edition so the original book is quite old. I don't think there is much change between the editions.I don't have a better suggestion because options are not really my thing, but I would love if somebody has a better book to recommend. Please add in the comments section."
3,Purchased as a reference,Not too much math covered here so an easier read for most. Practical advice throughout. The implementability or feasibility of the ideas are areas where I have some reservations about the coverage provided.
5,Great Book!,Excellent book on options. Talks about trading systems in which to use options and what strategies to use.
1,McMillan can't trade his way out of a paper bag,This is all theory and no application. McMillan's broker states that he loses money and makes money from his books. Show us your trades and not the theory.
4,A lot of valuable information on practical options trading,"This book is quite easy to follow if one pays sufficient attention. The math content that is present in most books on options is kept to a minimum in this volume.There is a lot of great practical trading advice, especially in the section dealing with locked-limit moves. McMillan also shows the reader how to dynamically interpret the put-call ratio and implied volatility levels.Good information on OEX and SPX options trading as well. This is great book for both futures and stock traders and of course, for options traders."
3,"Very comfortable, but too pointy","I used this bra when I was pregnant and it was very comfortable for around the house. However, it has a very pointy/cone shape that does not match my body, so it looked funny through shirts. I did not wear this out of the house."
4,Playtex Cross Your Heart Bra,The Cross Your Heart Bra seems to no longer be available in major department stores. I was glad to find it online.
5,Just what I needed!,"It's good to know that this item is still being offered. If I need it again in the future, I can count on Amazon.com to have it for me."
5,I love this Bra !,"I have been wearing this style of a bra for over 10 years.Everytime I try a different style, I never wear the bra.This is the best everyday working womans bra ever made !"
5,Love it!!!,I'm like the other ladies who like this bra. It's a hard size to find and I've been wearing style 4210 for many many years. Hope they never discontinue these. Just enough padding for privacy and not too heavy. Fits great!
1,Playtex Women's Cross Your Heart Foam Lined Heart Jacquard Soft Cup...,"I will not recommend this product and certainly I will not buy bras online again. I was excited because it is difficult to find a bra in my size, so when I saw it in the description and just click and bought a couple. As often happens, the sizing was wrong. Now I have a bunch of bras with a label that says one size but in fact they are a different size! disappointed!"
2,size doesn't run true,"Bras may vary in size about 1/4"" like jeans, but this A cup was a B in any other store or brand. Had to return it."
3,CrossYour Heart Bra,"This Bra was well made -- nice padding, but it did not have sufficient support under the bra for a size D. I found that the straps cut into my shoulders since they seemed to be the only thing uplifting the bra in place."
5,Playtex Bra,The service was very good. Price was better than in the store. The fit was very good. Would order from them again.
5,Great Idea,"This product is a great idea for those folks who find it difficult to start conversations. Pick one card, and the topic most often leads to another topic, then another. Very handy and entertaining!"
4,"Some cards create conversations, others don't","Some of the cards in here really aren't conversation worthy- and a little boring, but some have some interesting information that is worthy of further conversation. My kids (ages 11-18) don't seem to think they are that great, but my husband and I enjoy them!"
2,Table Talk Conversation Cards,"My opinion of the Conversation Cards is that they are perhaps appropriate for younger groups. I have not used them, my guests come up with more interesting conversational topics than I am finding on the Cards. I would not recommend them for groups older than high school age."
4,Nice Quality but you are paying for the tray.,"Like all Melissa and Doug stuff it is high near-heirloom quality merchandise. However, with this one I feel like I am paying a premium for the wood storage tray. Which, while nice, will only hold the 6 vehicles and makes it impractical to keep."
2,Not 100% Kona,I thought it would be all Kona coffee. Instead it is a mix from HI and other tropical islands. They should mention that in the description!
2,I wish it tasted as good as it looked,"We received this as a gift. We were excited to try it, because it looked pretty and the descriptions were so appealing. Sadly, it made a better decoration than beverage. We tried a few, and tossed the rest, just couldn't drink it."
1,Fake cheap ripoff. Buy gas station coffee instead.,"Received this as a gift. Wish I could return it. DO NOT buy this garbage. Nowhere does it say 10% or even 1% kona coffee, because it is not. It is equivalent to a garbage brew at a gas station. I lived on kona for 10 years and know what I am drinking. My mother sent this as a gift and I want to throw it in the trash. Buy from a more reputable seller for this is not one."
1,Buyer BEWARE!,BUYER BEWARE! This is not 100% Hawaiian coffee! But a Blend of coffees stated right on the front of the box.
2,if u really love dnb dont buy this!!,after hearing a few tracks by aphrodite i thought i should check him out and picked up this cd to my surprise his beats were repetitive and annoying i would not reccomend buying this cd if u like real jungle with hard hitting fast beats if u are looking for that kind of drum and bass i would suggest picking up AK1200 MIXED LIVE that is a great cd and i have seen him live he is great!!
5,Great listening!,"This CD is pretty wild... its a continuous mix, so it seems like a one hour song, and the songs lead into each other really well! You will not be disappointed."
2,Simply dull,"Very little to add here, pretty hum drum stuff with little imagination and artistry require ...much of the time the clarinet is a bit out of tune as well."
3,Very cute interactive touch and feel book but...,"They pull out easily, but at 20 months he still can't slide them back in by himself... which leave the pull out pages and the tabs that keep the pages in the book prone to damage. There are four Magic window books, two of which I bought new and two used. They seem to only last through one kid, before the tabs that keep the pull out page from sliding all the way out rips. And once the pull out page has been taken out of the book, they DO NOT go back in easily!So yeah, adorable books, fantastic idea... but not sturdy enough like other board books to be left alone with your toddler."
2,Hard Levels and Different,"I bought this game, and there were hard levels. I struggled through it. For example the charaters are only given 4 hearts so If you get hit 4 times you die. Also there's is barely any heals to restore the hearts. If you watched the series, it is slighly different from the game. There are only 20 levels by the way."
3,Above Average,"I found myself really enjoying this album. I have to admit that I don't know much about the band, but they were classified as prog-metal so I gave them a spin. The approach they take is guitar-heavy and subtle. Just enough solos to show you the ablilities without degenerating in show offs, and enough variety in the songs to mix things up. Grudge is tremendous, a standout track."
4,"Works well, looks nice",I wanted something more substantial than the clear factory sticker on the chainstay of my Surly Long Haul Trucker and this does the trick.
1,Garbage,"This would be the kind of thing you get as a freebe in a promotion. 50 cents is an appropriate price, any more is a definite rip-off."
5,Awesome ADO examples!,"I passed the exam, so I can't complain. There was plenty of ADO in the book, and that really helped on the exam. The MTS coverage also helps. The book was a little light on IIS objects (Session, Application, Response, etc), but with a working knowledge of IIS, you can pass the exam after studying this training kit."
4,Very Good for the Exam Only!!,"This book is very helpful when you think of it as a study guide for your exam preparation (70-152), I've already passed the exam with a score 800, I also recommend that u download all the brain dumps available on the internet. But if u want learn ASP I recommend this book : ""ASP 3.0 Professional"" from Wrox Press"
2,Expected Delivery,"This book will do the trick for a good overview of Interdev and distributed applications. It touches on MTS, SQL, DHTML, and ASP. However, as with all the other MOC Training Kits, don't rely on this book to give you exam success. For a more thorough look at VID, check out the Microsoft ""Mastering..."" series. If you're expecting to pass the exam with this book, then I give it two stars. If you're just looking for an overview of distributed programming/Internet applications, I give it three stars."
3,Mark of Fitness MF-90 Wrist Blood Pressure/Body Fat Monitor,"Ok. I wanna say that the Blood pressure measurement is easy, and i think the result is reliable. However, the Body Fat Monitor function like a joke. You need input several numbers and check out with the chart. And you also need keep your hands in a funny pose. I'd like to buy a product w/out this Fat monitor at a lower price."
3,"Good for BP, not fat","I had no trouble figuring out how to use the blood pressure device. It appeared to be accurate.The bodyfat measurement, on the other hand, was not easy to use-- you have to hit ""start"" while your hands are in a bizarre position. Then I got a different percentage using the device 10 times in 5 minutes. (from 19-24% as a female)Also, there is no way to input your activity level, which affects your bodyfat readings."
3,Wrist Blood Pressure,"I have a hard time with it fiting my wrist. I have an 8"" wrist.I particularly have trouble when I measure the body fat etc.This product is for an average person not an overweight person.I am able to take my BP, but it is not easy."
4,Worth for the price,"Checked the blood pressure reading from Doctor's office against the MF-90 and it's was very close. Pretty good for the price. I would also have liked to buy it w/o the Body Fat function. Overall, very useful and handy."
2,Fragile,I really liked it at first. It gave consistent readings that were clear and easy to understand. I wouldn't say I was rough with it at all but somehow it broke. The tab that holds the little door closed for the batteries broke off without any misuse.
3,Honest review,"I love this series, though I was disappointed. Despite its super cheap price, I was hoping there would be some more then what there was. Not a bad price you would pay more, in a store, but am going to look for box sets next time...considering how many seasons there are. If it was just a couple seasons of it, I wouldn't think twice about buying it, but there are about nine or ten and I might as well look for it in bulk."
1,Ignorant,Don't Buy this.It's bean one YouTube for years and isn't even worth watching.Just some Moron Halo players moving around and saying stupid Stuff.
1,WTF.....this is crap!,I was always told that this series was funny and great but I guess I'm just not that hip because Red vs Blue stinks. It's stupid and pretty lame. It had my attention all of 10min afterwards I could not belive I had acctually purchased this. It's a bit to immature for my tastes BUT to each his own!
5,WOW,This has got to be the funniest thing ive seen since we made our own videos here in iraq...most people wouldnt get those anyway they are inside jokes. But wow....i couldnt believe after the few online episodes i saw that they were selling the DVD for as much as they are but for the simple factor i have never laughed for an hour straight in my life ill pay 25 bucks...great buy for halo lovers improv comedy lover and just random laughs all around.
2,Kinda sad that it was a digital copy...,"I ordered this for my boyfriend who loves the Red vs. Blue seasons. Whether by my own fault or because it was never printed, I never say that it was a digital copy instead of an actual copy. We could only watch it on my computer and that was after the issues of trying to download the video player."
2,Only for the True Halo-Heads,"Be very discouraged. If you were expecting some inventive mech-anime, this definitely is not it. The novelty of those goofy amateur vids was entertaining, but this is boring."
3,Chaos Theory Explained in Simple Terms,"This is clearly written and concise non-academic attempt to explain the chaos of economics. The author does not mire the reader down in economic equations. He simply describes what is occurring in an easy to comprehend manner. His general theory posits that we can not understand how economies work - human actions are just too complex and chaotic to model. Because we can not accurately model these economies, we can not make determinations about the consequences of actions taken to ameliorate short-term economic problems. The consequence is that governments must focus their policy efforts on the long term and avoid intrusions in the market to correct short-term problems. The author also explores the connection between what is happening in society and economic trends. In an easy to understand example, he uses ants with two choices of food placed equal distance from their home to explain what he means."
2,One hit wonder cheese-fest,Don't be fooled! Original artists but not the original recordings. It sounds as if these 1 hit wonders all got together for a twenty year reunion to put on a cheesy lounge act. Maybe I'm a purist. I like the original recordings that I remember from my youth.
1,UGH!,"I agree wholeheartedly with one of the other reviewers of this CD--don't waste your money! The songs are nothing but cheap and lousy imitations of the original hits with the one exception of "" Treat Her Like a Lady"" by the Cornelius Brothers and Sister Rose. So, if you're buying this CD for that song, I'd suggest you continue shopping for another CD."
1,! CAUTION - NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS!,"!! CAUTION!!Re-recordings by the original artists.Almost as disappointing as if recorded by non-original artists.Deserves no stars.Please, do NOT buy this album as we don't want to encourage the powers that be to make or sell remake albums. scottie"
1,Book,Home made book. The price was way too high for what I received. It did have the necessary information needed.
3,Toxic Churches: some what helpful,"I purchased Pastor Dupont's book because I've been through some abusive situations in the Christian community over the years. ""Toxic Churches"" is good at explaining some of the problems, but it doesn't do much to help folks who've been hurt to heal."
4,Toxic Church,"It was good, Educational. So many churches have hidden agendas that aren't serving and worshipping God. This broke down the dysfunctions in our churches."
3,Our mistake,"This video did not live up to our expectations. We were seeking a hip-hop dance instructional dvd (our 7-year-old grandson loves to dance, move, jump, etc.). This dvd was more a story about hip-hop dancers than it was an instruction video."
4,Fun game. Takes some time,"We played this game at a friends house. enjoyed it so much we decided to buy it.This is a social game. It needs a family (or families) Not for little kids to play alone. There's not a lot of strategy or thinking in it (its not chess!) Its starts a bit slow, which is good as the instructions are a bit difficult to figure out, but once you find out what to do, it can be fun. I especially like the way the game is set up so that at the end, the person in the lead is not necessarily the winner. Think of a pack of hyenas descending on a lone wolf with the meat! Enjoy!"
3,Valley of the Pharaohs boardgame,"The game is visibly outstanding. The ""board"" is silky material and the games pieces are nice. The problem we had was playing by the stated rules. We played for three hours and still were not near the end so we amended the rules as we went to make the game more interesting and fun. It is basically just moving around the board collecting three game pieces and avoiding the mummy."
3,Defective Unit,I read nothing but good reviews on this toaster and decided to purchase one when my old one quit. I really liked the appearance and settings of this unit plus the easy access crumb trays. I was VERY disappointed to receive one that did not work due to damaged heating elements.
2,Darn,"I really wanted to like this. Love the styling. Love the features. But, ultimately, it's a toaster. And it doesn't do well at that basic function. Doesn't toast both sides evenly, not consistent between toasts. If I look in the well when it's on, I can plainly see the problem. Unequal heated elements. Such a simple and basic first step. Equal number of elements, all on, equals perfect toast. And as some others mentioned, it's turned WAY down, otherwise black toast."
1,Another broken toaster....,"I bought this toaster because I had tried a friends and loved how it worked. I wish I had taken the time to read other reviews BEFORE buying. Less than one year later the lever won't stay down, and it shorts in and out even then. This is the most I have ever spent on a toaster and I have to wonder why I didn't stick with the $20 models as I ended up wasting my money on this one. Pathetic. Go buy 2 cheap ones, they will probably last a heck of a lot longer!"
2,"Nice looks, but mediocre quality for a critical feature","The DeLonghi toaster looks good and has some good features. However, when it wore out after only a few years, I took it apart, and found what I consider a major design defect. The darkness control mechanism is based on a small plastic V-shaped part which slides between two sets of high-power electric contacts. One side of the V melted off completely, so the toaster only does the warming cycle. It may be that this part took a while to melt off, but it also seems inevitable when you put a plastic part against a hot contact. I wonder how you say ""planned obsolesence"" in Italian."
1,Looks Great...Broken Toaster is Your Fate!,The brushed stainless steel finish is exactly what we needed for our new kitchen. And a high priced toaster should equate to high quality!? This toaster would not toast after three months use. Can't get bread to stay down in slot long enough to toast. Also bought stainless steel DeLonghi coffee maker at the same time. In three and a half months it stopped making coffee. Now no coffee and no toast. DeLonghi promised to send replacements but they never did. These products did not last and there were just two adults using them once every morning. We've ordered new coffee maker and toaster from AMAZON made by another manufacturer. Thank heavens AMAZON that is always dependable!
1,Stopped toasting both sides of bread after 2 weeks,"Beatiful to look at, function of toaster quite disappointing. Stopped toasting both sides of bread within 2 weeks, but have still been using it, due to a job loss and need to cut expenses. Have requested to exchange item and am awaiting reply."
3,DO NOT BUY!,"I need to amend this review. This toaster is even more disappointing than I originally thought. Putting the dial up to 6(the highest) pre packaged sliced white bread comes out toasted lightly on one side other breads are warmed and not toasted. I would never recommend this toaster to anyone. DO NOT BUY!!original review: This toaster was a replacement for one from much simpler times that finally gave up. I am very happy with the features (haven't tried the bagel feature yet). Its rather big and bulky, takes up a bit more space than our old one. Toasting is sometimes uneven and one time a slice of bread, not exceptionally thin, got stuck below the part that should hold it up... what a mess... but it generally does its job, just not as well as I expected from DeLonghi"
1,RT-200 - TERRIBLE,"We purchased this toaster in 2007. 2011 problems. 01-2012 nothing.I am in my mid 70s and purchased a lot of stuff in my life, this toaster is among the worst. I have pd a 1/3 the price for toasters that worked well 4 times better."
4,DeLonghi 4 slice toaster,"This is a fabulous product that looks great, works well, and should last a long time. It seems to be well-built, although we have only had it a month or so. I only give it 4 stars because I find that well toasted bread takes 2 toasting cycles to complete. Have not tried the bagel feature."
2,Okay for the first couple uses but didn't meet expectations....read on,"I was really excited to get this toaster. It had replaced once that I had used for many years. At first it worked great. By ""at first"" I mean the first couple of toasts. Then the distribution of heat changed. The toast didn't toast evenly between sides of the bread, It would burn or get darker on one side then the other. The defrost selection didn't work as well...and, to top that off, some toast started to slip and fall to the bottom. I am very dissatisfied with this toaster. I wish that I had the box that it was shipped in, I would return it. It went in the recycling bin. The toaster will soon follow the same fate as its box."
2,Broke after a year!,"We bought this toaster to replace a 15 year old Black and Decker toaster that finally broke. This toaster worked well until about a week ago, when it stopped toasting. I think the wiring must have shorted out somewhere, because I see the blue ""on"" light flicker a bit when toasting, and the toast pops up too soon to actually be anything beyond barely warm, no matter what the setting. We have had this toaster for almost exactly one year. Totally ridiculous. I would expect a decent toaster to last longer than this."
5,Toaster,Searched high and low for a decent toaster that actually toasted both sides at once. This is it. I love this toaster. I used to return toaster after toaster when i previously bought them. What a breath of fresh air to finally get one that works and works well the first shot. I highly reccomend this unit !! Wonderful !!!
2,"Waited a long time for a Dented ""Brand New Toaster""","I waited almost 4 weeks for this toaster to arrive, and when it did, the box was crunched and the toaster was dented! Now I have to exchange it and wait again for a new one to arrive. What a dissapointment compared to prior transactions through Amazon. Lets hope they send me a new toaster and soon..."
1,Terrible Product,"This toaster after a week or two sltarted toasting on one side, then after 7 months the one side strtes ignoring the number dial so hs to be pushed down several times and soon thereafter would not hold the bread at all. The other side of this toaster simply locked up so we trashed it."
2,disappointed,"I thought that this (a 2 slicer)would be the answer to ""my prayers for a perfect toaster."" it isn't. I thought that it had long slots for bakery bread, it doesn't. the wide slots do not toast both sides the same on ""regular"" width bread. It does toast, sort of ok. But it is not up to what I expected from my experience with other DeLonghi products I have purchased. Really disappointed."
2,Does not toast evenly,"I have always liked Delonghi toasters. But, this one does not toast the bread evenly. One side of toast is not toasted when the other side is ready. I have to change bread sides during the toasting process and this is cumbersome."
5,Fantastic Color,"I'm a natural Red Head; so in the winter, I prefer to go a shade darker.I have never seen this color in stores; so I figured I'd give it a try and make the purchase off of Amazon.My final take on this product & color is great! Perfect spice and deep cinnamon coloring, and a very all over natural look.I'd highly recommend this product."
2,Surprise!,I order this for someone who is unable to get to a store. The subscribe and save. Price was two boxes for $12 every two months. The next shipment? $36! Read any notifications completely and don't trust you are getting a fair deal. The price for two in most stores would not be more than $16. The amazon new price was a 300% increase from past orders. What a shock!
3,WORKS GREAT IF YOU DO NOT PICK IT UP,"This is the same organizer sold by GM and Cadillac, but without the respective logos and for a lot less money. Fits perfectly in back of my CTS Sport Wagon. Only problem is when you try to pick it up with stuff in it, it comes apart...which is why the manufacturer says not to use to carry stuff around in it. Got it to hold grocery bags and keep them from sliding around, which it does perfectly."
1,Horrible quality and flimsy,"This is a horrible product. It is flimsy and does not stay in place. There are some velcro straps that you are supposed to use to secure it. There really isn't anything to secure it with in my 2010 Town & Country anyway. It broke when I placed it in my van and opened it up. This is going back to the seller. I also realized that even if this thing did not break, it still isn't a good option. It is heavy to take out and you can't remove it with things in it. I'm going to try the Chrysler minivan tote, which I think will be a much better solution. I fold the seats a lot in my van. Having to remove all my stuff from the van just to fold the seats down would be silly. I think a tote makes more sense if you fold your seats down a lot. You can just pick up the tote, fold the seats down and place the totle back on the flat surface. I wish I had thought of this earlier."
3,Good but can be better....,"The cargo organizer came on time and was packed well enough to withstand rain for a few hours that it lay outside my front door. Assembly was relatively simple and the product has been quite useful in my car. It comes in extremely handy for Costco shopping when there are no bags - it allows me to stack items nicely in the trunk of my car.The hinges to keep the different plates in place could be better - they are a bit flimsy. Given this, the price is slightly higher than what I would pay if I had seen the product physically before purchasing. However, it is much better than a $15 organizer with netting that I had used earlier.Overall, I am reasonably satisfied."
5,Fantastic product for my cargo area!!!,I use it to put food shopping bags in it as the cargo organizer hold them very well without any spill over!!!
1,Piece of junk,I was expecting for the price that this product would at least be relatively durable. It's far from it. The plastic sides and dividers easily warp and become bent out of shape. Then it collapses in on itself. Basically useless. I'd return it but I threw out the box already.
4,Random reviews.,"Another purchase I don't own anymore. I've watched it though.I'm sick of writing, so here's the gist.It's ""Lord of the Flies"" in space. Except lamer because it has fewer deaths and a terrible ending. KILL THE PIG! CUT HIS THROAT! BASH HIM IN!...er...what was I saying again?"
3,"A little too ""Cosmo,"" not enough Gyno","Guess I should have done my homework. I was looking for some pretty specific info when I ordered this book, and as the author is not actually a PhD or medical doctor, I should have known better. Granted, there is good information, but if you saved up your year's subscription of any generic womens mag, you'd have it all there anyway. Good variety of information, informative diagrams, and straight talk. Accessibly written."
3,*** Not The Slasher Film ***,Please be advised that the video listed here is not the horror movie which stars Jack Palance and Martin Landau. The video 'Alone in the Dark' listed on this page is a 28 minute teen scare video about drunk driving.-Bob
4,Excellent Sleeper South American Western,Great story. Excellent acting. Beautiful cinematography. Not sure how I missed this when it first came out. Paul Newman would be happy with Sam Shepard's depiction of Butch Cassidy for sure. Definitely recommend.
4,Moves slow but keeps you interested,"Great acting by Sam Shepard, wonderful cinematography, and a moving soundtrack create an emotional experience from start to finish. Life can repeat itself, and Butch Cassidy finds this out firsthand."
2,Slow and Boring,I consider flashbacks a device that is often used when a straight plot line isn't interesting enough. Even with the frequent flashbacks this movie was very slow and boring.
2,"Pointless western, waste of good actors","Production values are good. I love even okay westerns. Struggled to finish this one. Rather slow, completely pointless, and the direction of some quite capable actors is either non-existent or awful. Real shame. Underlying it all is a terrible script. I do wonder what the makers of the film though was worth making about this movie. Don't waste your time."
4,Excellent,"This is not a typical shoot 'em up fast action style western. Nor is it a historically accurate western. It's a 'what if' story about a western character, Butch Cassidy (Robert Parker).The cinematography is wonderful. Shot in Bolivia and you can certainly tell that.Sam Shephard's acting is great and I think the acting of the mining engineer is also very good.I'm usually good at predicting the ends of most movies. This one I was still able to predict, but only because of a reaction by one of the posse. Many people might have missed that & would indeed be surprised at the ending.I thought it was a good plot.I purchased the DVD & am glad I did.It's a movie I could enjoy again.I think you'll be pleased if you enjoy westerns."
3,Turn on the subtitles...,"Eh. Had high hopes for this due to the viewer ratings and the fact that I love a good western. BUT...maybe it's me but they mumble a lot. And my spanish isn't good enough to keep up with what they were saying. The scenery was awesome, the premise was good, the acting a little sludgy."
1,Not what you'd expect from good old Butch,"So... you're telling me that Blackthorn can shoot out oil lanterns at 20+ paces, in a dark mine shaft, but he can't shoot a fat, black rabbit from three feet away? And, when he misses, he picks up a rock?And... you're also telling me that his horse would run off, never to be seen again?I got 30 minutes into this melodrama and had to shut it off. You'd have to be a simpleton to appreciate this flick."
2,Same old western,A poor western with a typical story and typical acting and typical action. This was a waste of my time.
2,Watch before you buy!,"This movie was a great disappointment. It is not one of those great westerns that occasionally pop up out of nowhere like Seraphim Falls, or The Proposition. Instead this film comes with a breathtakingly beautiful trailer and the rest is rather mediocre. In my opinion the film looks and feels a bit amateurish. I know this is a harsh critique, but in between the gorgeous landscape shots there is very little story, with a lot of repetitive, awkward dialog, continuity errors, and some scenes with lighting issues. Unfortunately I was so impressed with the trailer that I bought the Blu Ray, and now after having watched about half of the film I'm ready toss the disc. Save your $$, rent the movie and see for yourself."
1,this movie sucked,this was a crappy movie dont watch itwatch butch cassidy and the sundace kid if you want a better western movie
2,not as good as hoped,"thought this would be better with sam shepard,very slow,just leaves you hanging in the end.not even worth a second view"
1,The plot: Butch's horse runs away from him. The end.,"So Blackthorne/Butch Cassidy decides it's time to mosey on back to the States twenty years after he was killed in Bolivia. He cashes out (he's a successful horse wrangler/trainer) and sets off across the barren wastes to America, a leisurely three year ride. He finds a dead horse, with empty saddlebags nest to it, an obvious bushwhack scenario, but he's oblivious and and follows the tracks and BLAM, he's bushwhacked. He's not hit but his very well trained horse takes off for the horizon, along with all his money of course, never to be seen again. Did I mention he's the most renowned horse trainer in Bolivia?From this humble and ridiculous beginning comes a boring and unnecessary movie, about nothing much. But it's free with Prime so find out for yourself."
4,Very good!,"It was a very nice surprise to discover this ""Bolivian"" western made by a Spanish director. Sam Shepard, Stephen Rea and Eduardo Noriega are very good, the action never decreases and the Andes landscapes are superb."
3,"Ok, but nothing special.",It wasn't what I thought would be. It started off good but slowed and became tiresome. I would have like it better if it were a tale of a winner but instead just left an empty feeling. Nothing special.
3,Blackthorn,"I actually rented this movie and downstreamed it through my blu ray player. I watched it with my son because the overview sounded good. I was really disappointed in the movie. It started out good with a sound plot, ran for awhile without any lagging, but then just fizzled out. Very disappointing movie. Lacked drive, substanance and an all over drizzled out plot. Don't waste your money!"
1,It's paint,Aaaand it isssss the slowwww drying kind. My three dollars paid for this fair warning. You're welcome. Turn back. You're not welcome in this town. You would not like it here any way. Now git. Yawn!
5,Great newer western,I really liked the story and the acting in this western. Probably the best to come along since the Unforgiven.
4,A surprisingly good western I never heard of before,Enjoyed this western a lot. Easy to watch and enertaining.Worth the fee to watch it. Hope you enjoy it too
2,can I get a witness,"I/m giving this western a low rating, It was slow, boring ,and very little action,sam sherpard is a good actor, this just didn/t cut it for him,his best we all know was the right stuff,as chuck yeager,I own a lot of westerns, sad to say, the last really good western,to me was tombstone, silverado,and pale rider in the 80/s.90/s unforgiving,quick and dead. before that, it gets even better. Is it hard to make a good western today ,someone please tell me,rent it."
4,Good western,Sam is very good in most of his movies and this one is no exception. Well made and entertaining. Well worth watching.
4,Worth you time.,"Interesting movie. Good story. Well enough acted. Beautiful scenery.Not all movies need to be rapidly action packed, imho. Sometimes a good story is enough, and this one is.Reminded me a little of the old Westerns...It's worth your time, and with Amazon Prime, it's free to stream, so give it a try."
2,11 month olds not very interested in it,Maybe my 11 month old boys are too old for it... this toy did held their attention only a few seconds and it got tossed away.
2,Puzzled.,"My son got this for his first birthday, but neither of our boys have ever shown any real interest in it. I thought it would a great in-car/travel toy since all the pieces are attached, but they've just never wanted to play with it."
5,Melissa & Doug Wiggling Worm Grasping Toy,"I purchased this item for my baby when he was 5 months old. He is now 9 months old and its still one of his toys he plays with the most. I love it because its so cute, durable, and eco friendly. Worth the $!"
5,Love wooden toys!,"Sometimes the simplest is the best. I bought a bunch of wooden toys for our son's first Christmas because I wanted him to use his imagination, be curious and most of all I wanted to play with him too; not have a bunch of flashy lights and loud sounds babysit him. That said, we bought a bunch of Melissa & Doug toys (and Wonderworld) and I love EVERY SINGLE one of them!This little worm is very durable and although it might be a little wide for some babies' hands to grasp, it wasn't a problem for our 8 month old. He likes to chew on it and watch me contort it into various positions (I love toys as much as any kid!). I love that it's simple enough that it will be a long lasting toy; he could play with this all throughout his childhood as an action figure, for instance."
2,Wiggling Worm,"The quality of this product is great. However, my 9 month young daughter could care less about this toy. I can play with it, show it to her, and she moves on to other toys."
2,"Cute, but . . .","It is adorable and a good quality, but my son was never interested in this AT ALL. I gave it to him when he was about 9 months and we kept it around for a year. Maybe younger babies?"
1,Avoid this chair.,"This chair is heavy and poorly made with brittle plastic parts, is really something that companies buy by the hundreds as promo items with their logo on it. Avoid. Oh yeah - the return policy - 15% restocking fee and no refund - credit only - avoid this company - Variety International as well."
2,Heavy and not very durable,"Overall I was disappointed with this chair and hope to return it. One of the arms did not snap/lock into place and the other pieces of plastic on the chair seem like they will fall apart under the slightest use. It does not seem durable at all. But once set up, it is comfortable and the cup holders are nice (even though one arm did not lock). It seems to me that you would be better off buying a chair that does not have plastic because it will be lighter and not prone to breaking."
3,you can find better chairs for cheaper,"this chair does the job, but i am definitely glad i only bought 1 instead of 4 like i had originally planned. I like the fact that it has 2 cup holders, but they are very shallow and i doubt it would hold a drink if the chair got bumped. I prefer the other folding chairs that have a deeper mesh fabric cup holder. I thought about using a dremel to cut out the bottom inside the cup holders but then i realized it wouldn't be able to hold cans if i did that. However, on the plus side, i didn't have the problems some of the other reviewers had with the arms not locking and the fabric tearing. it *seems* sturdy enough, but i don't know if such is the case with someone that weighs more than 200lbs.Overall, it works for what i need it for i guess, but i am going to go to walmart or something to buy the other 3 i need, since i have seen better chairs that only cost $20-$25."
2,Didn't support my weight,"It says it supports up to 250 pounds and I weigh only 185, but after about a month of use, the fabric tore and couldn't be repaired. Not worth it."
2,Clock,this is a pretty nifty clock . Nothing to bad here - just DO NOT count on the projection - it is VERY diffieculy to see.
4,a very nice clock,"My 11 year old daughter loves this clock. The design and colors are modern and beautiful. The projection works great, but only at night and only at a distance at about 8 feet (from bedside table to ceiling). The only thing we don't like is that setting the time with a dial is difficult for accuracy -it's not your typical buttons."
1,"Flimsy, hard to use","My kids love the way this clock looks and the idea of it, but it is flimsy, and the controls are awkward and hard to figure out with or without the manual. Consider another model."
2,Unhappy,"I expected the projection feature to be a bit better...It is hard to see in terms of brightness and size. Also, I do not know if it is standard in these clocks, but you cannot change the direction of the projection, so that the projection can be upside-down or side-ways depending on where the clock is positioned relative to the bed. I have to put my clock away from the bed (too snooze happy) and so the projection is upside-down. Sure, I can just look at the clock, but the projection thing seemed kind of fun. Also, I was a bit surprised at the size of the clock...very bulky."
4,"So, you think your life is hard to handle?","Believe it or not, Robert Morgan may be the first man to be in touch with his ""feminine side"". The Truest Pleasure illuminates life on the farm, motherhood and the complexity of marriage, all too well. This book is a rare gift, which gives the reader an excellent view of how a woman may feel in the everyday life of her marriage. If you are stumbling in your own marriage, bored with a relationship, or tired with the daily grind, give this book a chance to open your eyes."
5,"Moving, magnificent book not to be missed.","This book is a must read by everyone with a soul! Ginny and Tom become a part of your being as you read and live through their struggles of life in the early 1900's. I have reflected many hours about Ginny's revelation of 'The Truest Pleasure' at the end of the book. A wrenching tale about love, spirit, and inner reflection."
4,A BEAUTIFUL STORY!,"Robert Morgan is one of my favorite authors. Having been born and raised in the mountains, he knows the people there; their way of life, their dreams, their passions. Although I enjoyed this novel tremendously, it was just a wee bit of a let-down after having read Gap Creek. I hope Robert Morgan keeps cranking out more novels about mountain people."
3,"Good, but not outstanding","I thought this book was good, but it wasn't great. I have also read Gap Creek and I would recommend reading that book rather than The Truest Pleasure. This book was well written and clear, but it wasn't very interesting."
2,I can't believe I read the WHOLE thing. . .,"but I'm glad I did. Morgan redeemed himself in the end. Otherwise, the plot line was just a string of disconnected events. If I hadn't been a fan from Gap Creek, and impressed with his sensory language usage and creative descriptions, I would not have finished it. For example, Pa lost his wallet on the way to church, and Tom found it under the wagon seat. I was suspicious of his behavior, but nothing ever came of it, so what was the point in mentioning it?"
3,"He said, she said","I just finished reading this book and enjoyed it for the most part, but there were a few things that irritated me. For one thing, everything was ""he said, she said, Tom said, Joe said, Pa said."" Surely the author could have been more expressive than that. And also, Ginny was not an ignorant woman. For someone who supposedly read all the time, her grammar and spelling should have been more educated. The ""hisself"" and ""set down,"" etc. was just a gimmick to make the story more homey and hillbilly, since that's what all southerners are, right? A southern accent doesn't equate to ignorance, but I guess he had no way of portraying the accent without corrupting her speech. One more thing, something as significant as a person's commitment to a particular religion should be well understood BEFORE marriage. Tom should have married Florrie, and Ginny could have married David, but, of course, Ginny was the one that inherited the land that Tom wanted so badly."
3,Makes you appreciate what you have.,"The book itself irritated me because I'm not religious and the protagonist is extremely spiritual, as most were in the late 18 and 1900's. However, the ending was uplifting and humbling, causing me to really appreciate the people in my life."
4,Masterful and Beautiful,"The cinematography in this film is breathtaking. The fight scenes are spectacular in that ""people are flying around the room"" sort of way. The plot twists are unexpected and interesting. Fans of movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers would enjoy this film."
2,What did they do to this movie (and why),"I saw an asian import of this movie on DVD about the same time it was hitting the theatres in Denver. Other than the fact that all of the menus were in chinese and I had to follow pretty odd instructions to get english subtitles, I was impressed with the underlying message of the movie. I also thought the use of color shifting really added to the whole experience.I just got the american version of the DVD this week and the subtitles SUCK. They completely changed meanings every chance they had and the finished product looks NOTHING like the movie that originally caught my univided attention.I hope Miramax NEVER chops another chinese movie. If you don't mind a little extra work for a much better version, find the import."
4,review,"Its was great I lost my original copy and wanted to replace, but couldnt find it at all let alone at a good price. And here it was at a great price I love it."
2,Boring,"If your a Nartial Arts fan this movie is ok, the fighting is ok. But the directing is bad so is the script. I can be hard to follow at times. I think this movie was very boring and cant understand how it has 5 stars"
2,Communist propaganda,"This movie is basically communist propaganda. It is about how the center of the country dominates the provinces and the value of having a strong central leader. In other words, it is a paid ad for single-party dictatorship in China. Artistically, it is good, but from the point of politics, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Also, the director seems addicted to showing different colors (entire rooms of yellow, entire rooms of blue, etc). It got boring after awhile."
2,support your local emperor,"That was the point of the movie in a nutshell ---- and that the individual's needs are not nearly as important as the group's. Not really all that surprising; it is a Chinese movie.My care for the story slowly disintegrated as the movie plodded along, with fight scenes that were half-hearted --- some just pointless.No amount of color filters could save this film."
1,What did I miss?,HaikuVery high ratingsFor a terrible movie.Many critics suck.I have never been so baffled by so many boffo reviews. This movie is essentially an exercise in art house cliches. Movie-goers will look back on this phenomenon years from now and scratch their heads in amazement.
1,A Waste Of 99 Minutes Of Life.,"Scenario and showmanship are good and entertaining, if you can overlook that people walk on water, walls, and fly around. The storyline is schizophrenic and nonsensical. I got frustrated waiting for an end that took too long to come.SPOILER ALERT:No sequel here, everybody dies. Some several times."
1,"I have been fooled by IMDb rating, just wasted my time to watching it","I picked it to watch because of its high rating. The movie is awful.15% of the running time, the heroes were flying like birds. I got tiredto watch those flies. I am not talking about reality but they alsokilled any sense of poetry. Actors acting is nothing of acting. Nofacial expression, no body language, just dummy's martial art playaround the clock. You call that a perfect movie? You're kidding me!"
2,"great visuals, awful story","Ok let me just say that the special effects for this thing they call movie is great, probably one of the best ive ever seen, but the story is just not interesting enough and the fight scenes arent even that interesting, I think it tried to hard to be like crouching tiger,hidden dragon and it failed miserably. Chinese martial arts films are not supposed to be like this, and thats that."
2,HERO- HUH,Well it was a great copy. Picture wise BUt.and I do mean but. There were no english subtitles. The movie I bought gave me a choice of Mandarin and A mandarin subtitle. I got to watch the fighting scenes without knowing what the hell was going on. That really sucks because i love Jet-Li
1,Horrible!,I am a huge Jet Li fan. I've never seen a quinton terantino film that I've liked. I think he is a horrible director. This is the only movie with Jet Li that I didn't like. Everything about it is terrible.
4,"Great movie, disappointing BR transfer","Hero is one of my favorite movies, so when I got a new TV and BR player it was one of the first ""updates"" I bought. Watched it last night and was very disappointed to NOT see any difference in the picture. The DVD was gorgeous and so is the BR, just not any better than the DVD. After seeing such an incredible difference in other BR-over-DVD movies, I was expecting the same here. Poop! What's worse, I just happened to see the review that mentioned how this transfer is a lot better than the House of Flying Daggers one -- which I also bought and haven't seen yet. I love wasting money replacing movies I already have with movies that aren't any better........"
5,A True Masterpiece!,"This is by far the most beautiful movie I have ever experienced. It was a great plesure to enjoy the delicious combinations of colours with each person's side of the story and not to mention the wonderful martial art being performed by some of Asia's hottest Martial Art Artists: Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. And not to forget the charming caracter of Ziyi Zhang (who had her breakthrough performance in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon). This movie is a true masterpiece that carries a sweet sadness through its charismatic story. If you decide to watch this movie, and please do, don't forget a package of tissues! Enjoy."
3,Sumptious propaganda,"Hero is a visually impressive production on a grand scale. The cinematography and visual effects are worth watching for themselves, as are exquisitely choreographed fight scenes (including many flying dance moves). The plot is for the most part effective (comprising three different versions of the same events) but lacks the emotional depth of ""Crouching Tiger."" But by far the worst element of the film is its feebly disguised Chinese propaganda, in which a tyrant is allowed to go on conquering because his destruction and war on neighbouring provinces ultimately unites China into ""one land,"" i.e. the good of the many outway the good of the few. This is little more than a weak justification for China's contemporary geopolitical designs and sours an otherwise entertaining flick."
5,A 6 stars movie,"This film is a masterpiece of all genres. Please try seeing the movie before reading too much about it. It will surprise you. Other reviewers will tell you the ins and outs of the plot, the making, etc. DO NOT READ THEM BEFORE YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE. And enjoy!"
1,Yet another poor movie from a rotten director,This movie not only requires you to open your imagiation but to forget all sense of reality. So far EVERYONE I talked to that has seen this move thinks it's just as bad as Kill Bill 1 & 2 and this is one director that really should stop making movies!
1,...,"THIS MOVIE WAS EVERYTHING I HATE IN MOVIES! AND NOTHING OF WHAT MADE ME LOVE A YIMOU MOVIE! I SEE EVEN YIMOU CAN SELLOUT WITH A BIG BUDGET MOVIE! THE ACTION SEQUENCES WERE SILLY, AND THE MOVIE TRIED TO DAZZLE THE VIEWER WITH ALL THE COLORFUL BACKGROUNDS, BUT LACKED THE HEART AND THE PLOT OF A YIMOU MOVIE! THIS WAS AS [BAD] AS CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON! THIS MOVIE MADE ME PUKE! IF YOU WANT A GOOD KING OF QIN ASSASSIN FLICK WITH MORE REALISTIC ACTION SEQUENCES MINUS THE SILLY FLYING, GO SEE OR BUY THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN! POOR YIMOU!!! I LOVED EVERY MOVIE IVE SEEN OF YOURS, BUT I DESPISE THIS ONE!! HORRIBLE!"
1,Uhm . . . no,I'm a huge Jet Li Fan and this film was incredibly disappointing.Enough said.Sorry Jet.
1,Rubbish,What is this 1914? I shouldn't have to read a movie. The effects are lame an innapropriate; this movie is complete rubbish. I feel guilty for even attempting to sell it to someone on ebay. Horrible.
1,i love jet li's movies except this one,"ok i love action films except this one... the previews fooled me really badly, i thought jet li would somehow take down all the arrows like how the previews showed it...but...*spoiler*....no, he dies. that is a tragedy. if ur marketing a film and setting an expectation, make sure u meet it otherwise people get angry, like me."
1,SUCKED!,"It may have had good fights and effects, but I found this show to be quite boring! I was too busy trying to keep up with the subtitles to figure out what the heck was happening during the movie! If I wanted to read, I would have waited to order the book!"
4,"Gorgeous settings, score, story, but what an ending","Not going to ruin the ending for people, but even with the sad ending, this is one of the best movies with Jet Li. It reminds me a lot of Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince. From the philosophy of how to become a good king and betrayals thereof. Everything about this movie is pure aesthetic, and art for arts sake. The backdrop is so illuminating and dreamlike. How in one moment, the scenery is very green, then very red, that it gets really fun to guess what the next color will be. Overall, an awesome movie you don't want to miss."
4,Hero,"Visually spectacular. Heart moving and Inspiring. If you loved Crouching Tiger, hidden dragon, you will like Hero."
1,Audio Is A JOKE!!!,"The movie itself is fantastic, and I have been looking forward to this release for months. Today I got online and started reading some reviews on this release and come to discover that the English dubbed version of the film is the only soundtrack that is in a lossless audio format. That is ridiculous!!! It makes no sense since on every release of the film the mandarin audio option is the default format. I will not be buying this film and hope that enough people notice the audio formats before wasting there money on this crap. How can an independent movie company like miramax let someone butcher the blu-ray of a great movie by releasing a version like this...."
4,Gives your HT audio system a workout!,"As entertainment and spectacle, this film shines. I loved the powerful soundtrack and beautiful visuals.Also as a work of art, ""Hero"" rises much above most visually impressive movies of this genre---the plot does require a fair amount of concentration and thought to really understand, and during the last 30 minutes or so a strong Buddhist subtext arises unexpectedly. This was a pleasant and remarkable surprise.The subtext is Buddhist, but also very nationalistic and politically convenient from the Chinese perspective---I'm sure that the still-totalitarian Chinese government must've been very happy to see this one come out!The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt that many of the fight scenes were a bit overboard, and things got a little melodramatic towards the end between the main characters.But it was a very fun way to spend 2 hours!"
5,"Colorful, inteligent, nice M A movts. takes.","I'll recomend it. It is more drama than action, but still a good movie to watch. Very good camera takes in the line of crouching, Matrix, etc.."
3,Fantastic action but did not hold my interest,Well the action is good. It pretty much left me cold story wise but lots of people get the crap beat out of them and the action is fantastic.
4,Great action movie,"Hero is another story along the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon theme featuring many of the same characters. It is the story of an orphan called nameless who is presented to the emperor of Qin as the man who killed the most notorious assassins in the kingdom. Namely Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow. The story becomes more convoluted as the movie progresses when we discover the hero is not all that he appears. There are some spectacular special effects in the fight scenes. My only dislike was the overuse of coloured filters in one of the fight scenes between the two female leads. Otherwise a great action flick with a really moving ending."
4,Jet Li - Hero,"Jet Li pulls it off again. One of his better, epic films of 2000, this film has a very deep plot. While action and fight scenes are a little skiddish, the film is action packed overall and is filled with talented actors. Definite keeper for your Jet Li Collection and also one of his last 'epic' films to be created."
4,Stunning,"Excellent movie, lots of action scenes to thrill the eyes. A must have for Jet Li and Zhang Ziyi fans."
2,Boring and Unsubstantial!,"I was really excited to watch this movie. I thought it was going to be some kind of masterpiece based on the reviews and word of mouth.Wow, was I disapointed.A) Slow motion was used way to much.B) The way the told the same story five (or however many) different ways just bored me to death. I almost fell asleep a few times while watching it.C) A few of the early fight scenes were good. Most of the others, again, relied too much on slow-mo!D) Some of the large army scenes were too CGI'd for me. You don't even have to look closely to see that the people are duplicated.E) Each time a character in the movie is stabbed, they show the victim's face and you hear the sword go in. EVERY SINGLE TIME- How trite!Comparing this to ""Crouching Tiger"" is a joke and I feel bad even mentioning them in the same breath.I'd give it one star but I did enjoy the first half hour of the film."
1,A piece of junk,"Besides the colorful of screen, there is nothing worth to watch.The story is ridiculous, the kung-fu is full of fake action.Do NOT waste your time and money. Find something else."
1,Overdone,"With a cast like that, I expected a decent film...I could never get into it, though. I felt like I was having ""art"" shoved down my throat...each flashback has a color scheme, like red, green, etc. It gives the movie a great visual appearance, but ultimately distracts and removes the viewer from the experience...it reminds the viewer he/she is watching a movie, rather than relating to the movie directly. I've never had that sensation in a Hong Kong or mainland movie, even those for which I had no subtitles and had only the images to tell me the story. Plus, I can see the same person die only a couple times before I get fed up and say, ""just kill the guy, already, and get on with it!""Odd thing...almost all of the people I've talked to in mainland China hated ""Crouching Tiger"", but loved this movie."
2,The truth,"This film does indeed look good, sound good, and has some nice aspects to it. But, come on. All of these glowing reviews ignore the fact that this movie is a rip off of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is shown to us in slow motion (most of the film is in slo mo). It also is basically a propaganda film spouting communist themes (""one land""...""one party"", sound familier?). Jet Li's character won't kill this terrible, brutal tyrant, because a united land under a evil dictator is better than 7 different kingdoms? Get real. This is one boring movie, and all the wire fighting and color schemes in the world won't change that. See this movie for what it really is, mellodramatic cheese."
2,A work of irony?,"Gorgeous cinematography, but pretty boringly told. Excessive use of slo-mo detracted from the action sequences. In repeatedly borrowing from Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, Zhang may have intended this as a work of irony. It certainly slipped past the Chinese censors. Most Chinese audiences are, of course, immune to irony."
3,"liked the cinematography and color, but..","this movie was fine, however there was not enough ction and the storyline was too complicated. this movie was so boring to me that i watched it seven times, in parts, because i didn't want to have to try to remember every little detail when something new happened."
2,overrated,"Hero can be appreciated only for its artistic vision and execution. It is beautifully shot, with sweeping camera angles, vivid costumes, and well choreographed fight(s). However, the movie is flawed at the core. The script is confused and loses its original goal. It becomes a schmaltzy, over-the-top display of colors and costumes with no point to it. It does have a nice little action sequence in the beginning with Jet Li and Donnie Yen but that is about all. THe other fights are just dramatic scenes that end up being slow motion shots of the actors faces as they fight."
1,"Masterwork movie, very poor quality DVD","If you have an HDTV, this DVD looks awful. A stunning movie that simply looks terrible on screen."
4,Visual Tour de Force,"This movie was a visual tour de force that I will have to see several times in order to take it all in.The symbolic use of colour is stunning, as are the action scenes, and photography.I did get lost a couple of times reading the subtitles while trying not to miss any of the visual story. This is another reason I'd like to see the film a few more times.Hero, legend, myth - all very well told!Sorting it all out is the viewers job..."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"Zhang Yimou's first action film is a masterpiece. The cinematography is amazing and the use of colors creates a unique tone to the film. This film was perfectly casted. Maggie Cheung is wonderful as always. Zhang Ziyi also does well, along with the rest of the cast. I cannot wait for this to come out on dvd so I can add it to my collection. A must see!And by the way, I think this film should have won best foreign film at the oscars. (But the oscars are political anyways, right? Shouldn't pay to close attention to their picks.)Zhang Yimou is a god!!"
4,Stunning visual feast,"This movie far exceeded my expectations. It is possibly the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen and, unlike many martial arts films, it has an engaging story. The character interactions were touching and the film's message was powerful. I loved that the entire film was in Chinese with English subtitles - it gave a much more authentic ambiance to the film.It only lost 1 star for me because of the 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' style wire acrobatics - I just find that style distracting because it is so obviously not real it breaks the spell of the movie."
2,Not a great addition to Blueray,"I just got it today. Its one of my favorite films. No doubts about its visually stunning scenes. But i should say this Blueray version doesnt seems to be that great compared to a dvd version. If you have a dvd then dont buy this. If you want to save some money, then buy a dvd instead of Blueray disc."
4,good movie,"I have seen better martial arts movies. However, the cinematography is fantastic, the story is good. The fights are great! It is worth a watch, if you like Croucing Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or House of Flying Daggers."
4,"A visual stunning movie, that's it!","""Hero"" is an eye-popping,jaw-dropping visual feast of martial arts, it has nothing to do with Chinese politics or Communist propaganda, period!"
3,The good and the bad,"The good:Beautiful cinematography, interesting plot, good acting.The bad:This movie is way too stylized. Too much slow motion and special effects. The fight scenes are so scripted they look like ballet, not fights. And the last time I checked, humans can't fly.If you can totally check your disbelief at the door, you might love this movie. Even though this movie has some major positives, I prefer films that are believable."
2,"may the NAMELESS, BROKEN SWORD never fall from the","SKY like FLYING SNOW on your sleepy head! an old chinese proverb. this movie is boring, ridiculous and sleep inducing. it may be a chinese cure for insomnia except you'll probably be tired again an hour after you wake up. and i thought hollywood movies were bad. chinese movies are worse. much worse. maybe indian movies are better. yeah sure. oh well, i also ordered rob zombie's ""house of a 1000 corpses"". maybe that's good. p.s. always remember the very honorable story of the (chinese) emperor's new clothes and look for what's really there, not what some pompous jackass tells you is there. and may the QIN be with you."
3,A good movie.,"After reading some of these reviews I was not sure I saw the same film. As far as the politics and history of the movie are concerned, it is irrelevant. At that time of civilization most of the earth was in conflict. I believe this movie was intended to show the transformation of Nameless as a bitter assasin driven by human rage to a man of ideals. No more no less. I have read about some of the ancient history of China and it is as complicated as complicated can get.This movie compares with Gone With the Wind as an historically based novel. Just like Gone With the Wind we see character transformation instigated from the outside events. Don't get me wrong, Gone With the Wind has no comparison in its genre.I would have given this 3 and 1/2 stars but as you all know that is not a choice. I recommend this movie as a good movie but not as a history or idealistic movie. Jet Li is a good actor."
4,High quality,A great tale of revenge and redemption. Excellent battle scenes. A must have for almost any collection.
2,Not down to earth,Too many wire act acts and way too may big blowing fans.Did not care for the phony action in film.
3,Ziyi Zhang gotta be used to those cables by now....,Another artsy martial arts movie with matrix style special effects(been there seen that)and 10 minutes sword fights..what was the point of that fight between Moon and Flying Snow?(it looked cool)..and how many differant ways can Broken Sword die? And that gay fight on the lake..what was that?..YIKES
4,To fight violence with non-violence,"After the movie,I was wondering whether the emperor could be interpreted as Saddam and stability be taken into consideration in the present war.If US did not kill Saddam and just whispered in his ears like in the movie what he ought to do,what would things be like now?The directer had said this was a anti-war movie and that it should have had a good chance to win Oscar.(It didn't win.Obviously,he had no idea how Oscar is given out.)"
1,Colorful Propaganda,"The message of Hero is quite clear: the idea of Greater China is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's ""sanctimonious traditionalism"" and its ""glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness."" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than ""fascinating fascism."""
2,"Great graphics, but what a dumb movie.","I know it's a movie but it has some ridiculous assertions.SPOILERS!!!1) Two ASSASSINS did a FRONTAL assault on the Emperor and was able to hold off his entire army just by twirling their swords.2) When Jet Li's character kills the Emperor's targets, non of the Emperor's men bother to double check that his targets are actually dead.3) No Emperor is stupid enough to give the reward of letting people drink 10 paces from him.4) If the Emperor did give out such a reward, no assassin would be stupid enough to take it up, because if anyone really got that close to the Emperor, it would have turned out to be a decoy."
2,Hero,"I waited excitedly for another Jet Li movie to come out. After looking at this movie, I was very disappointed. The same killing scene kept repeating iteself. I didnt like the movie at all. I wanted my money back. I am a big Jet Li fan. Hopefully his future films will be much better."
2,Two Stars only !,"A nameless warrior (Jet Li arrives at an emperor's palace with three weapons, each belonging to a famous assassin who had sworn to kill the emperor. As the nameless man spins out his story--and the emperor presents his own interpretation of what might really have happened ,each episode is drenched in red, blue, white or another dominant color. Hero combines great fighting scenes to many dry scenes.I can't even say I liked this movie.It was terrible.Even w/ Quentin putting some work into this movie it still isn't worth watching ,buying or even renting.I wouldn't by this movie at a flea market."
3,"My Review Based On the ""Original"" film","A friend of mine gave me the original, subtitled version of Hero, and I liked it... sort of.It is a very pretty film and some of the fight scenes are of Jet Li quality (really good) while others are ""Crouching Tiger""-style high-wire acts (not so good). Jet Li stars in this big budget film as a soldier/assasin who starts questioning the motives of his king. He is the main reason why I watched this film and I was not disappointed by his stunt work, nor his acting ability.There is alot of talk about honor and Zen philosophy, a whole lot. People who went crazy over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will probably like this film more than me, it is much better than that dreck but I wish that it more wireless fight scenes in Hero.I recommend that people rent the original version, I'm sure this edited version has a different ending tailored for American audiences (a bad idea)."
1,Hero,I felt robbed and all i did was rent it where was my war epic its odd boring and simply just a bad movie
5,"Great film, very Taoist","The spectacle was great. (If you're not big on wuxia -- the credibility-bending bits where the warriors fly around -- it helps if you think of the story as mythology, which it is; accept that, then sit back and watch the interesting spectacle of two swordsmen jumping across the surface of a bright green lake.)Other than the spectacle, what I found fascinating was the Taoism. There's a lot in this movie about the proper role of an assassin, the purpose of kings, the importance of a noble goal, the structure and order of society (especially reiterated in the ending) -- all very Taoist ideas. It's something I find a lot of people I've spoken to have missed completely because they don't know squat about the Tao. It amazes me that the nontheistic Chinese government allowed the director to get away with so much of it. You can actually use this movie as an introduction to that philosophy. Plus (and not to take anything away from the philosophy) it's a very cool action movie."
3,DVD is Disappointing,"As another reviewer mentioned, the video quality is extremely disappointing with grainy, desaturated, blurred imagery like a pirated copy. How could this slip by in production? This is a spectacular and beautiful film treated in a disrespectful manner. While it does retain some of it's beauty, much is left to memory and imagination to enhance the visuals."
4,"Worth seeing, but only one side of the story","""Hero"" is a visual feast and a well-done movie, but if you see it, you must see ""The Emporer and the Assassin"" as well. For those who aren't familiar with the link between the two movies, they are stories about the same people. However, ""Hero"" is the Chinese government approved version, while ""The Emporer and the Assassin"" is actually banned in China. Both are superb, well done, and well worth seeing. [...]"
4,"beautiful, thoughtful, very Chinese","I watched House of Flying Daggers and liked it so much that i rented this the next evening. Good choice, the visualness of the movie is breathtaking. Moving from one dominate color to another to normal, as a technic to saturate your mind with one theme at a time.I like the highwire and swordplay, since that i the genre it doesn't feel fake but as expected. There is a twist were the emperor guess that he setup the whole thing and is there to kill him. I missed it until it was explict, having been to wrapped up in the details to see the big picture.The scenes are beautiful, moving around in China to get different places, something that might bother someone who knows where things are, in my ignorance i don't mind. There are lots or extras and a black sky of arrows, technics that overwhelm the senses, making the director and the camerapeople tops in this movie.watch in Chinese with subtitles, it feels better, to hear it right. worth buying and re watching."
3,Pretty good,the scenary was Beautiful. it was very stunning the direction&sights throughout the film. however some things dragged&the story was kinda slow in spots. still it was a cool film in many ways. Jet Li was on point. it's worth checking out.
3,Not what I expected,I was very disappointed to find that the village people were not sitting on benches. I normally receive what is pictured on the box. Since it was a gift it was a little embarrassing. I would have been happy to purchase benches as well had I know that they were not included.
1,Couldn't finish.,"I so wanted to enjoy this book. I really did. One must give credit to Ives for all of his research but I found the book impossible to read. Most annoying to me, he provided information, then disproved it, and finally argued that it might, in fact, be true. I reread several passages trying to understand what on earth he was trying to say. Other authors have done a better job of speaking about the people of the court - title changes, multiple names, it's all a big confusing mess here. Reading this, I felt like I was slogging through a textbook I HAD to read. So I quit. I will find another book about Anne B that is more to my liking and doesn't leave me so muddled."
2,Not enough biography to be worthy of the book title,"The book is tirelessly researched, which is its main problem. Insteadof telling a cohesive story, the book is mainly an exhaustive (and exhausting) analysis of source material. The narrative thread is totally lost. Very disappointing."
3,The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn,Plenty of facts it reads like a history text book. I was disappointed and then finally bored. If you want just the facts this is the book for you.
5,You MUST read this book if you're interested in Anne Boleyn,"I just loved it, the author has researched her life so much that I'm pretty sure you won't need another biography of this woman after buying this book.But, this is NOT a novel, so if that's what you're looking for, you shouldn't get this book.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a historical, accurate and serious biography of Anne Boleyn. Brilliant!"
5,The best Anne Boleyn biography!,"I have been reading about Anne Boleyn since 5th grade and I couldn't put this biography down. Her life and times come alive. Dr. Ives has a gift for detail and drawing one in that has only gotten better with each book. I couldn't wait for this book to be released and I wasn't disappointed. He was very balanced, letting the readers draw their own conclusions. His writing style is lively and highly readable, not always the case with historians. If you have any interest in these people or this era, this is the book to read."
3,Kindle Edition (for iPad and Kindle Readers) Unfairly Priced,"The stars (only three) are not because of the quality of the book, but because the hard- and paperback editions have 64 illustrations, but the Kindle edition (for both the iPad and the Kindle) omits these. Given the lack of pictures of the important people written about in the book, it is ridiculous that the Kindle edition costs about the same as the paperback.If publishers are going to leave out important parts of their books when formatting them for e-readers, they should lower their prices for their ebook versions."
5,Fantastic...!,"Always intrigued by the Tudor Dynasty, this biography offers insight to Boleyn's world.It's hard to imagine what she went through growing up, being manipulated by her Father and her Uncle, and the ensuing tragedy.She did make her mark in history as well as her daughter Elizabeth I.If she could only be alive to look back at what her life contributed to history."
4,Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII,"I am also reading, ""In The Lions' Court"" by Wilson. Was Anne Boleyn really that involved with decisions or was it all Henry? Did she along with others become an obstacle to Henry? No one will really ever know."
5,Best Study on Anne Boleyn,Eric Ives new edition is the most valuable study on Anne Boleyn. It also is an entertaining and easy read.
2,CONFUSING,"I was so excited to get this book, but only 30 or so pages in, I'm worn out. The author jumps back and forth and there are so many names and ranks of nobility mentioned here and there and everywhere and back and forth, it's hard to keep up. Or maybe I'm just slow or something. I am so fascinated by Anne, but I truely hope I can get through this book, for I love her and I love to read. I'm hanging in there."
2,"Lots of Facts, Boring Read","I bought this book along with Alison Weir's ""The Six Wives of Henry the VIII"". I have to say after forcing myself to finish the first chapter, I gave up and opened Weir's book. Ives focuses too much on small details, names, relations, and lineage that he ends up creating a cumbersome and mundane read. I was bored to say the least. Weirs on the otherhand engrosses you with her storytelling of facts. Save your money and purchase one of Weirs books instead!"
1,unreadable,"I was really looking forward to this book - however it ""reads"" like a dry dissertation. It is NOT for the lay reader - rather scholars. There is so much minutiae and detail, something like 40 pages of endnotes; this is the kind of book that gives history a bad name - dry and intimidating. The author spends several paragraphs presenting evidence from various scholars on the every possible inane detail including the ages of Anne's siblings. He can never just say something, EVERYTHING is qualified - X evidence suggest such and such while Y evidence suggests such and such, but then Z evidence would suggest such and such. It is maddening. I couldn't even scan it for a coherent story."
5,An exceptional approach to learning about leadership,"Drawing on Grant's memoirs and other writings, the author presents 250 valuable lessons about leadership and management from the life of this famous general. The conclusion offers a dozen overriding management principles. The book is an ingenious approach to providing insights about leadership interwoven with glimpses into the life of this colorful civil war leader who greatly shaped history. The events of Grant's life give this work a vivid quality and make it enormously absorbing as well as informative. If you seek knowledge about the nature of leadership and also enjoy the adventure of history, this book is for you!"
2,Big disappointment,"This book highlights the only drawback of ordering on-line: You can't pick it up and thumb through it. If I had, I would have put it back on the shelf. The book consists of 1 or 2-page anecdotes from Grant's life, and then (sometimes loosely) connected to a business principle. While I found some of the anecdotes mildly interesting, the business lessons were sometimes insultingly simple. A couple of examples: (1) Don't swear. (2) Interview people in person if at all possible. I was looking for a book with a narrative that provided insights into Grant's strategic thinking, his psychology of leadership, etc. Instead I received fortune-cookie truisms linked loosely to Grant's life. I think what I was looking for may be found in Tom Wheeler's book."
4,"Well written book, with good advice.","I found it both intertaining to read, and thought provoking. It is full of logical advice, and real-world examples."
4,Interesting Lessons from General Grant,"In ""Cigars, Whiskey and Winning,"" Al Kaltman breaks down the autobiography of Ulysses S. Grant and offers lessons on leadership. Kaltman is shrewd enough to rely on heavy passages from Grant's book which rightfully ranks as an American classic and lets Grant do most of the speaking. Kaltman does not shy from Grant's rollercoaster life, highlighting both the highs and lows though his take on Grant's presidency is rushed and could have been better. Still, there are certainly lessons to be learned from Grant's dramatic life and Kaltman does a solid job of illustrating them."
4,Interesting reading...interesting information,"This book is a quick read. I particularly enjoyed the author's focus on Grant's ability to react, adjust and adapt. Staying away from Grant's presidency was a good idea until the end. Even then, the author contrasts Grant's leadership style as a General to President and why he failed (at least historically) as a politician. What I didn't like about the book was the lack of reference to God. I understand that not everyone is firmly rooted in ""the Word"", but its absence leads to more questions...at least for me. Overall, thought provoking, mildly insightful and interesting. I heartily recommend Lee's Leadership Lessons. It is the best book of this style I have ever read."
1,Refund....,"I was dissapointed when reading this book. Total waste of money.I bought this on Kindle.Too much faithToo much presumptionNot enough details about the mystery or possible science of the events.God this, and Jesus that......blah blah blah. If I'd wanted bible lession I would have downloaded it onto my Kindle.Total sham."
2,"I was generally disapointed in ""Light and Death"".","This book is written from the perspective of a conservitive Christian with extensive knowledge and access to NDEs. Scripture is used to interpret NDEs. When NDEs agree with the Bible, they become prof that the scriptures are inerrant and when NDEs don't, it is because evil has tainted the experience. Purely from a Christian point of view.. Not recommended for those looking for a more universal or balanced perspective."
3,No Episodes,"Oops. I didn't realize these were just some clips of the guests in the office, doing just their routine. I was hoping for the whole episodes. Should've read better.But- good guests, funny stuff."
3,"Not really ""The Best""","If you're a fan of Dr. Katz and just want to get one DVD, supposedly this is the one to get. But it really isn't the best bits from the show's long-ish run. More accurately, it contains the bits with the comics or celebrities who are most famous now. Certainly not any kind of criterion for determining ""best."" But if you neeeeeeed your Dr. Katz and can't afford the 3-figure pricetag of the full box set, then I guess this will have to do!"
3,ok,"It certainly isnt the best skits in my opinion from the show, but if ur not into collecting every seoson it wont disappoint u."
3,Could be better,"I don't think this is a good book for learning from, but if you know the material, it is a good reference."
3,D.E book,"The book is fine. At the beginning it look very complicated, indeed the vocabulary use was be a bit complicated. But after reading some chapters one can see that overall it is easy to understandable ."
1,"Basically worthless, not worth the paper it was written on.","I have begun my semester with a rather poor professor at the University of Michigan. In fact she explains many things under her breath, and the only way to get it, is through psychic powers. Therefore I am required to read this drivel on my own and try to understand the topics. Most of the problems have squat to do with the section topics. Additionally, the problems are vague, worded improperly, and essentially devoid of any learing value. I would recommend that you save your money and purchase a decent copy and get this crappy one from the library."
2,Meteocre level text,"I was required to use this book as textbook. It really doesn't help much but if you're the type who doesn't like to sit in during college lectures of a course such as Differential Equations, this is the book for you. It is hard to understand the text for this math book becasue it might ask you to refer to something in the previous chapter. I would definitely go with the first edition of this book. It was much better, and I myself have used the first edition. It is easier to understand. I have not completely read the book, but from what I have read (most of it) I can atleast say that this is not the ""best of its kind"". Chirag"
1,Vague and Confusing...,"When taking an introduction class to differential equations, I found this book to be completely unhelpful in not only mastering the material but simply learning it as well! The explinations in this book are completely confusing and quite wordy. The examples and figures shown within these explinations often times don't even relate to the problems contained within the section. If a concept was not explained clearly, or not at all in lecture, it was very difficult to go back through the section and learn it with the book. I cannot express in words how frustrated and disappointed I am with this book. I am very upset that my professor selected this book because I know there are better texts out on the market. I also had to waste a lot of money for this wordy pile of drivel."
2,Very confusing book,"Used the newer edition of the book, which appears to be exactly the same. Found the book very confusing and hard to understand any of the concept without having someone else explain it to me."
3,"Average, Could use more worked examples","Luckily I had a very good professor for this class, so I didn't need to depend on the text as much as I might have to in other classes. As an engineering student, I don't ignore theory, but I do need a few more worked examples for the text to be really useful for me. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate rigor and I do like mathematics for its own sake, but, I could have used a little more emphasis on applications than this text provided."
2,Disappointing and unclear,"This book was used in an introduction to differential equations, and was of very little reference value. The theory is extremely distant from application, and the scientific and engineering motivations for solving differential equations are not apparent. If a concept was missed in lecture, it was often an ordeal to attempt to learn from the book."
2,Professors: Beware!,"I had to drop out of the class because of this book. Calculus was always my favorite subject, but this book just made it too confusing. Too many theorems and definitions without any examples. College professors, have mercy on your students and choose another book for your differential equations courses!"
4,Very realistic and fun,"My 4 year old daughter received this as a gift and absolutely loves it. It's durable and easy for her to get her baby in and out of. We put the base in our minivan and now her baby is able to travel with us ""safely."" Plus she loves that it's just like her baby sister's car seat. Even my 2 year old son enjoys playing with it."
4,excellent condition,The book came as promised; the problem is/was that I ordered the wrong edition! It would be unfair to review the book because I'm not using it! But it is beautiful and I will keep it as a reminder to pay attention to the edition when ordering textbooks! Lesson learned!
1,Truly Moving,"Paso a Paso 2 is truly amazing. I wasn't even taking Spanish class when I accidentally bought this book. Reading this book is so emotional, inspirational, and heart-warming. The pictures included in this book were so meaningful and full of life. I felt as thougth I was reading National Geographic and John Steinbeck's The Pearl mixed together. This wonderful textbook has changed my life completely! If you need a book to read, Paso a Paso 2 is the perfect book. I recommend this book completely!"
4,Not color,"I chose Season 3 Vol 2 because product description says, boxed set, color, dvd, fullscreen. It is NOT in color. This is the second western series I have purchased that was listed color but was actually black and white. The quality and sound are good, but I would not have purchased it had I known it was not in color."
5,Head'em up and move them out Classic,This another great volume and Season of Rawhide hope more seasons will be release soon i want them all !!!!
4,Great Value / Quality,"Not much on words but this Microscope is a great Value for my needs. Easy to set up and seems to be working great so far, used only a few times."
3,Insecure pitch,"Just got this after hearing that Opus Kura had secured a superior master to the more widely circulated version by among others Music & Arts. Very disappointed as there are serious issues with wavering and incorrect pitch. For example, the 3rd movement has wavering pitch, and is overall slightly flat. As a result, the movement is 1.5% longer than it is on the Music & Arts CD (20'22"" vs 20'07"" from beginning note attack to decay of final note). Also, there is an odd compression during loud passages, that by my taste sounds better less compressed albeit a little distorted on the Music & Arts CD. This is arguably the greatest recording of this work, and I would have to recommend the Music & Arts remastering."
5,This was truly an inspired manuscript!,"I only wish that I had the talent to articulate the profound impression that this book has made upon my life. The author utilized every literary avenue to assure that the reader was drawn into the environment of all of the characters. The only other stories that could compare to this (in my opinion) is the biblical account of Joseph and Jesus Christ themselves. To exemplify Christ in the midst of that kind of bondage is awesome. I only pray that in the freedom (although still a slave to sin) that I now enjoy, I can do the same as the character Joseph. You can be sure that the next book by this author will be on my shelf next to ""The Dark Sun Rises."" This book will be a ""must read"" for my children."
1,Awful Packaging,"(The Walking Dead Omnibus Volume 1 & 2 HC) The books are awesome, the poor rating is for the packaging only.Just received replacement books for the first ones that were damaged (Omnibus Vol 1 & 2), Volume 1 is damaged AGAIN. The binding on the first 2 were cracked on the corner, one of the replacements is also cracked. When I pay $60+ for collector books they better be in new condition.The books were just laying in a box with large loose bubble wrap, they were free to move around and damage the corners. I normally have good experiences with Amazon, but they have no freaking clue how to package books. Very frustrating."
3,"Book is great, shipping methods are terrible.","First off, I would like to say that The Walking Dead comics are amazing. I have all of the hardcover books and decided to order the Omnibus editions to add to my collection. I will say, Amazon has a great price on these books, and that's what caught my attention. The problem is the shipping. It was posted on their website that they were planning on improving this. They have not. The corners of my books were all smashed up and the paper was peeling off. The only thing that makes me want to keep them due to the awesome story and the fact that they were half price. If you are thinking of ordering the books because you have watched the TV show, I would highly recommend it. The comics are better. Amazon has ruined the experience for me though. I've spend $200 dollars on books form them and this is the worst I've seen."
5,Awesome,"I am ordering another one as my husband hogs this one in his car. All great songs - queen delivers in this one. If you are a queen fan, get this."
5,Queen - Mskye,Freddie Mercury is one of my all time great singer. His high octave voice will never be replaced. Now I have this music on Mp3.
3,Very good collection... but not sure about the mp3 quality,I bought the mp3 version. The music quality unfortunately is not as lively as I had hoped it would be.-I'm listening to it via amazon mp3 cloud player on my laptop with v-moda 80 head phones.
4,The best single disc greatest hits.,"""Queen"" have had numerous collections through the years, but whether they were released in the U.S. or the U.K., they were always short a few essential songs. Well as far as I can tell, this is finally the collection most casual fans have been waiting for. It's 20 remastered tracks, including ""Another One Bites The Dust"", ""We Are The Champions"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", ""Killer Queen"", and many others. Plus a live version of ""Under Pressure"". Of course there's good songs missing, but the main hits are here, so I suggest you buy this in a ""Flash""."
5,Great Album,This album is a must have for any Queen fan. The songs are just great tolisten to. I love to listen to it after a long day.
4,Tie your mama down,"It is all Queen, good selection of their work and well put together. Only one song that I am not too crazy about. Got it on sale so it was even better. I would recommend if you like rock and if you like Queen"
5,awesome,This is a classic MP3 CD to own. I purchased over thanksgiving for only $3.99. Money well spent. I love this cd.
3,what's not to like.,I can't believe it is asking for a review. This was a music see download I wanted and it is what I expected.
4,Marred by 2 live cuts,"This should've been a slam dunk, but the compilers decided to stick on 2 live cuts of Queen classics, ""Under Pressure""(live 1982 WITHOUT David Bowie), and a 1982 live ""Tie Your Mother Down"". So my suggestion: download those and eliminate the 2 live ones, and you'll have the ultimate single Queen hits CD. But shouldn't the compilers have done that instead? Sneaky record company Greatest Hits CD tricks. Song by song info are the only liner notes. A good starter for those interested in Queen. But take my advice on the 2 live ones."
5,Has all the songs I love on it.,"All my favorites in one place! I still want to cry every time I hear ""Who wants to live forever?"", probably always will."
4,Queen Rules,"How sad that this group broke up because of the HIV tragedy. The harmony and emotion in every song is astounding. There probably is no one on earth who hasn't heard some of Queen's music. The ""We Will Rock You"" theatrical performance is now being heard around the world. And this particular compilation has all the best; plus, the live version of ""Under Pressure"" is not to be missed. Beautiful, rhythmic, and incredibly harmonized music. Long live QUEEN!!!"
5,"Great, but a few omissions","I bought this version of Greatest Hits (there are lot of them, aren't there?) to replace my red Greatest Hits album. Overall, the We Will Rock You edition is a solid set of early Queen songs (from 1974-82). And unlike the red covered Greatest Hits album, you don't have to be subjected to the awful song Body Language.Unfortunately, there were a couple omissions. Tie Your Mother Down and Keep Yourself Alive should have been added, along with the studio version of Under Pressure.The live versions of Under Pressure and Tie Your Mother Down should have been dropped. Those versions are on On Fire at the Bowl, so why did they need to be added to Greatest Hits: WWRY?But forget those problems, this is a solid CD. If you want a CD of old Queen songs, get this one."
4,good price,"I have always liked their songs and am saving this for my grandson, along with other older rock bands that I like"
5,Great show.,I really enjoyed the concert footage and the behind-the-scene interviews. It is a very well produced and sounding blu ray disc.
2,Won't always play,"The songs are great and sound very good, but the CD must have a strange format because not all CD players will play it. I have also seen it crash at least 3 different computers when you try and play the first track. All and all I'd say buy the other greatest hits CD's from Queen instead. I forget the names but one has a blue cover and the other is red."
3,"""We Will Rock You"" edition?","First, I want to admit I have not listened to the CD. I just got back from seeing the We Will Rock You show in Las Vegas. The show has songs this disc does not have, and the disc has songs the show does not have. The WWRY tag on this disc is just marketing. Two essential songs missing are Radio Ga Ga and No One But You, which the show uses as a tribute to Freddie. I will buy the 3-disc set."
1,I'll use itunes from now on!,I can't download the songs to my iphone. Itunes is easier for me to use so I won't buy music from Amazon again. Proved to be a waste of money :(
5,this games is cooool,this game is alot of fun... i've only had it for 18 hours and already i've played 12 hours all together... i love to take the engine apart and all that stuff...
1,Not compatible with modern systems,Why continue selling a product that isn't compatible with Windows XP Professional? None of the movies would play with the most recent version of Quicktime and the application crashes frequently. Not recommended.
4,The Secret Camera,It was an interesting first hand account of how prisoner's were handled during WWII. The camera was actually a small part of the story. I would recommend reading this book.
2,Not sure who this book is for.,"Like much of the rest of the Power Japanese series, this book does a good job of introducing vocabulary that you may not find in other sources. However the vocabulary is so high level that beginning and intermediate learners will have a hard time memorizing it and using it in conversations. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the book covers such a wide variety of specialized fields that the terms may be inadequate for an advanced learner. Advanced learners may be better served by reading books written for Japanese people about a particular subject. If you find books written for adults too difficult, books written for children and teens may be helpful. Beginning and intermediate learners might impress some people by reading sentences out of this book, but you'll probably never use a lot of this vocabulary, and hence will probably forget it. There are better books to spend your money on."
2,Waste of Monetary Funds,"This book will teach you how to sound pedantic and insincere in Japanese. It is basically a list of buzz words that stupid people throw around in the states to sound smart. It teaches absolutely no grammar, so you will spit out words like ""radioactive waste"" in broken, incorrect Japanese."
4,A FANTASTIC READ,"Xaviera is definitely an extremely interesting lady who has lead, and continues to lead, a very exciting life, as is obvious in this great book! The parts about the girls in her life were quite poignant!"
5,Proven success,"I was given this book in 1976 to read. I had just bought my home and promptly broke my ankle moving in. I was off five months and during that time a friend (a true friend) gave me Mr Nickersons book to read. Within 18 months I had my first rental. Over the last 25 years I have accumulated six homes in the San Francisco North Bay. The real estate values were behind when I read the book and off by 20x now, but the principal don't change. I owe my success to this very basic book. I am sorry to see it is no longer in publication."
4,What can I say?,"This is a ""hard"" charcoal soldering block, which is what I wanted. They neglect to mention that in the description. If you are doing any kind of soldering on precious metals then you should have one of these. Don't forget to quench after you solder or you'll end up with a really expensive, smoldering mess. This is a ""hard"" block so don't try to press soft metals into it. If you have to hold something in place then get a set of third hands. This block reflects heat well and allows one to finish the job efficently. It is charcoal so it will leave black marks on your work surface. This is the best product I have used for soldering jewelry."
2,"Mediocre product, miserable support","The stroller is a great concept, looks uber cool, and has some very nice features, but it is under-built, flimsy, and breaks easily.One of the selling points is that it folds nicely for air travel (with $120 accessory travel bag). Unfortunately, the seat angle latch broke on our first trip and the latch to fold the wheels broke on our second trip! Stokke told that this happens 'often', and charges $250 for the repair! The latches are made of flimsy plastic, so are easy to break (and the travel bag has no padding to protect them). The weak latches should be re-engineered and failures covered by warranty!Considering the premium pricepoint, I expected better engineering and support. Stokke 'Customer Service' is profoundly disappointing."
2,God is smarter than this,"I was looking for help teaching this subject to middle schoolers in a Christian school. I find the discussion questions far to broad to prompt actual discussion in the older end of this spectrum and too deep for children in the younger part. From Chapter 12 ""Do you think Moses will be happy in heaven becasue he made this decision? Why? (yes, Moses will be happy because he did what God wanted him to do. He will be able to enjoy the Lord forever in heaven."" Yikes, I can hear the crickets already.Not enough practical like balancing a checkbook, how credit cards work etc. and way too many softball discussion questions."
5,Loved it!,The interactive stories really helped my kids understand the concept of how the Lord views money. They enjoyed the challenge of looking up the bible verses that they had read in the story and getting a bigger concept of money rather than that it is fun to spend. It was a book we all looked forward to sharing together.
5,replacing my used up falling apart copy.,I used this wonderful book so much my hard cover fell apart and is missing and soiled pages. It is my #1 go to book for comfort food. Now I have to replace it..can't live without it. Reading the stories is also comforting.

2,Broken,Watch broke in first month. The crown failed and it does not keep accurate time. Sent it for warranty service and they say they are fixing it but 6 weeks later I still don't have a watch. It was nice while it lasted...
1,Not even close to what I was expecting,Wasnt ready for english subtitles that were totaly off time and made no sense and almost no action.
2,More Misses Than Hits,"Every trite WWII cliche and plot is trotted out in this one. The leads are woefully miscast. Michael Shannon is simply awful. Susannah York is not credible as the glamorous doctor, mother, aristocrat, socialite. I guess the producers wanted the Susannah York part to be Susannah York, which is too bad because she was a fine actress and her part seems to deserve a better script and direction. To be sure there are some good moments among all the stories (the grocer, his wife and her brother are pretty good), but most of this stuff has been done before and has been done better."
4,Cosmic ark.,This game is kind of werid but fun. U r in a ship that lets this pod out and u r in it and u try to avoid bullets coming at u and each level u beat it gets harder. The graphics and sound is the same as any other atari games and the control is easy. I would tell more but it still has been a long time since i have played it. It is a fun game.
2,Hypocritical like all Christians,"Forget what all these other pantywastes say. This release of drivel is nothing but substandard Darkthrone worship wrapped in a chritian cloak, even further wrapped up in a Blackmetal blanket to fool kids into thinking that it is actual blackmetal.When this cd came out it was concidered a joke within the Blackmetal scene and still is to this day. The only ones who rave on this album are little sissy mallrats who only got into Blackmetal when Cradle of Filth started selling shirts in Hot Topic. These same kids who did not have this when it was actually released now try to say it is a benchmark of Blackmetal. What a laugh.This is not Blackmetal by any means. Do not be fooled. This is nothing but a sheep in wolves clothing. Like I said above, substandard Darkthrone worship."
3,Needed a good editor ....,"While filled with interesting details of the interplay between Abwehr, Gestapo, and SD, I personally found it difficult to follow in spots. It could be a much better book with good editing. Nonetheless, you get the flavor of the brutal ruthlessness of many Nazi personalities who flourished in a criminal regime."
1,"Fascinating subject, horrible writing","David Yeadon's book on his experiences in the Outer Hebrides is unfortunately rather dull. The style is bland, riddled with clichés, and the only truly interesting descriptions we get are in the form of quotations. There are some bright spots; his conversations with local residents are intriguing. I only wish that he would have allowed them to speak for themselves; virtually every interchange with the residents is punctuated with David's insipid observations and framed by his own rather portly ego."
4,"Great, burnished voice","My own personal favorite here is ""White Ginger Blossoms,"" where Alfred Apaka's voice is perfectly phrased and a precise, deft, delicate touch. Some of the faster party music on the record is pretty kitschy, but especially in the slower tunes this is some of the very best Hawaiian vocal music out there. Overall, this record is a real trip down memory lane and a great pleasure."
4,Nautical New England guy mystery,"This is a very solid read. I'm a little surprised it won an Edgar but it was almost 20 years ago. Standards may have changed.What stands out about this mystery is the nautical/Cape Cod element. Boats and ships and ship building are the core of this novel. I found this interesting. The plot is a little far fetched, but I'm not a bored guy trying to get through a mid-life crisis by poking my nose into a murder. My middle aged husband has gotten quite a kick out of this book - so maybe it's a guy thing.Bottom line: a good read - easy to imagine the reader on the beach with this story. I'll check out at least one other Boyer book."
1,What am I missing?,"How this book won any type of award is beyond me. The main character's wield of power over local law enforcement authorities is about as unrealistic as they come. I gave this book 164 pages to ""grow up"" but it let me down. Adios, Mr. Boyer."
2,Pass this one up,I had high hopes for an Edgar award winner. I gave it 120 pages but the motivation of the protagonist to find a missing boat is unbelievable.
1,Information,"I chose this rating because there is one fact in the book that I know to be untrue. There is a part where he talks about a young guide on the Brule River in Wisconsin, named Steve Weyandt. Steve Weyandt was not the name of the guide, it was Maxwell Weyandt. Steve is Maxwells brother. He guided 3 U.S. presidents down the Brule River. I believe he got this information through a book that was penned by Steve's wife Dorothy Weyandt. She wrote this book back in 1976. If you go to Brule, Wisconsin and ask around you will find out the correct information. I just wanted to point this out."
2,Not Rewarding,Not much of a book. Could be a research paper from which a Hoover biographer might lift anecdotes and background material. Unless the reader is an avid fish chaser much of this chronicle cannot be appreciated.
5,"Great read, great idea!","Although my baby isn't born yet, I really loved all the ideas in this book. Before I knew there was a whole diaper-free movement, I knew there must be an alternative to diapers...who would want to sit around in one of those all day?? I was really happy to find this...it makes a lot of intuitive sense. Of course, I don't know whether it'll work for me yet, but I'm trying to read all the baby manuals I can while I still have time! I'd definitely recommend this one."
2,sethsmom,"The other reviews were right on in that this method is so important to understand. But my lactation consultant gave me a Pediatrician's book (Dr. Jill Lekovic), and it was truly better (and totally different) than any of the other things out ther (I've read them ALL). She truly educates you about this topic in a holistic, worldly, historical and very knowledgeable way. It makes this book useless and was a much smarter and funnier read."
4,Great Guide,"This book was broken down into sections (basics of EC, and then EC'ing for different age groups) which was very helpful. I started EC'ing at 10 months so it was great that i didn't need to read everything starting at the newborn stage. Very easy reading - important when you are trying to catch reading time during nap time. Also not 'preachy' - it allows you to feel good about trying this without doing it 100% of the time.Not for the parent (caregiver) who wants a very detailed formula on elimination communication. Great for the parent who can trust their instincts and can generalize information.This is not about potty training. EC is about learning to read and understand the signs that your baby is giving you. This book does a great job of explaining the philosophical perspective behind elimination communication.I would definately recommend it."
5,Works for us,"This is the only book I bought on ECing and it has worked out well for us. We started at 1 wk old and after about 3-4 mos a poopy diaper was rare, and if it happened we knew immediately. At 9 mos he wakes us up to use the potty at night and many mornings has a dry diaper. We don't EC all the time, it's pretty much if we can we do.I read an article by this author in mothering magazine, previewed this book and found it to be the least expensive so I went for it. I have no complaints.The information was clear, informative, and relevant. Any repetition just helped me learn the info better."
4,Question conventional ideas about nappies,Highly recommend a read. If nothing else it will get you thinking in another way. Easy to read and follow with great practical tips and real life examples.
4,"Good especially for parents new to the idea, or ASL users","I got this for my son and daughter in law for their baby. She was exposed to American Sign Language so this was a good adjunct so she could indicate and communicate more of her needs and signals.I am strongly opposed to the recent trend of letting children go in diapers, without intervention, practically to the kindergarten years. I think it is a misguided notion that guiding the child to use the toilet will scar or harm them, on the contrary I think getting out diapers will add to their sense of mastery ,and confidence, if done in the gentle manner the author suggests.If cats can be trained to use a toilet, why can't a toddler?"
5,I wish everyone knew about this,"I like how this book is so very laid back about this practice. My daughter is diapered in disposables and I am more of a ""part-time"" person as described in the book. At most I've gotten my 3 month old to EC 4 times a day outside the diaper, with minimal to NO effort. It has there for saved me up to 4 diapers a day, you do the math! I like to think I'm having less negative impact on the environment, saving money, and preparing my daughter for real potty training later on down the line.I get odd looks from my mother and a few friends, I feel like they are really missing out. It's so sad in this country people don't more often question things. People used to do what this describes even here in the USA! It's more of a lost art, and it really doesn't take much effort at all. I truly believe it is of great benefit to your child, my girl smiles every single time she uses the potty."
5,Great book!,I purchased this book after learning about elimination communication. It was a very easy read. It has inspired me to continue using EC with my 6 month old son. I know this book will continue to serve as a reference in the future.
3,Disappointed in this book,"Maybe my expectations for this book were too high. I'm a big ec supporter and was so looking forward to it but felt let down when I finally read it. I found the books by the more established authors BouckeInfant Potty Training: A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Livingand BauerDiaper Free: The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygienefar more complete and informative, so if you only plan to read one ec book, go for one of them instead.I do like the writing style of this book (same goes for the other two ec books) and applaud the author for providing another book in this genre. A strong point is that this book urges parents to take things slowly by using ec part time or just occasionally, however this point and some others are made over and over again.I didn't find much original material in the book. In short, a rehash with a slightly different emphasis and flavor."
5,Great Book!,I loved this book! Very informative and yet simple to read and understand. I am excited to try the things i have learned when my little girl is born in April.
1,I returned it...,"I'm disappointed. I downloaded this through itunes so I could not look at it first. I see two fatal characteristics of this recording.1. It says it is the unabridged version of the New Testament. So, I expected it to go from Matthew to Revelation. But what I got started in Luke. Disappointing because my students are studying Matthew...2. 5 tracks for the whole new testament! How are we to search through to find the portion of scripture we need in less than an hour!The kids/drama/music are cute but Zondervan should not be advertising this as unabridged and it has to be user-friendly."
4,Great value,"I've had the duvet cover for well over 6 months now, but have only used it regularly in the past 3. And after several washings and nights of rough sleep, it is still like new. I'll admit that a few loose strings have emerged thus the 4 stars, but none that compromise the integrity of the cover. It fits an oversized king down comforter easily. Keep in mind that it is not a luxury duvet cover, but is a viable option if you're on a budget."
4,I Like It!,"I was surprised at how much I like this duvet cover. I have a VERY white goose down comforter that gets dirty very quickly! I've been looking for a cover for it. I didn't want to spend alot of money, but still have a decent thread count. This seems to fill the bill. It's soft and cool to the touch. The blush color is very pale pink, matches my sheets and curtains. The only thing, it's a bit large for my full size comforter, but that's better than too small!"
3,Blush is Peach!,If you are looking for a blush/pinkish color do not order this item in the blush. It does not look like it does in the picture. It is a light peach color and not a blush at all. And it completely clashes if you have a pink room with a pink theme.
3,Nice price......,I bought this duvet cover and was pleasantly surprised by the inexpensive price. The only thing I would change about the cover itself is I would make I from a thicker fabric. It reminds me of two bedsheets sewn together. Overall it is nice for the price.
3,"Bad color, noce quality","The duvet is a great quality, very soft, but not at all near the color in the picture, in fact not a very good color at all; a better color would easily earn a 4-5 star rating."
1,complete junk,"NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED. Even for its price, I could have found an equivalent item at the nearest Bed, Bath Beyond. It is not even soft. My current spread feels 100% better than what was ordered. Disappointed, yet what can you expect online?"
5,one of the greatest prog metal CD`s,"This is a six star CD, its true and if your into progressive metal I`m sure you will agree. The material on this CD is so strong that for me it was life changing, very few CD`s can I say that about. The songs are brilliant and varied , the music just splendid with emotion and execution that has to be heard to be believed. I love the label Magna Carta (who these guys are on) they only sign up the best artists. If you want a CD with a huge concept that will provide a life time of entertainment get this.Thank you Shadow Gallery for providing us with one of the greatest Prog Metal CD of all time !"
2,Terrible,"I purchased this cd because it came highly reccomended by other customers. I could hardly wait to get it! With the anticipation of a young child on C-mas morning, I ripped open the cd and anxiously put it in my player. Just imagine my dissapointment when the singer began crooning out the worst vocals ever! The music was ok, but my God, the singer reeks. Do not buy this cd. There are to many other good prog bands out there."
5,buy this cd,"After hearing parts of Shadow Gallery's ""Carved In Stone"" cd, I had decided that this was a band that I would ignore. But I borrowed ""Tyranny"" from a friend. And it has lived in my cd player ever since. It has all the elements of a prog. classic. It starts with the Dream Theater inspired ""Stiletto in the Sand"" and ""War for sale"". From there, the band mixes styles of hard and soft rock, while keeping a prog style intact. There are really no over the top, complex odd-time signatures. The song writing is very good and mysterious with ""Hope for us"" and ""Christmas day"". All in all, a very good and impressing album from Shadow Gallery."
3,"Good album, but somewhat overrated.","I'm going to get some stick for this review, but what the hell. I got this album after reading the reviews, and while I am not sorry I bought it, I am a little dissapointed. The music is generally well played and the vocal harmonies are great, however there is hardly any bass present, and just too much singing! I was really looking forward to complex jams and lots of odd time sigs (big Dream Theater/LTE fan as you can tell). My stand out tracks would be # 4,5,9,11. Overall this is an enjoyable album, which is relatively easy listening, with a good concept."
5,awsome.,"i really enjoyed this shadow gallery album. great arangements.its allot more progressive then there debuit cd and their 2nd album. guitar work is great, and i was blown away by the drummer in this album. great album."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I wanted to like this book; I really did. I wanted a book full of doctors' stories that showed human concern for patients. To my dismay, I found that very few of the stories are like that. It seemed that most of the stories were just Dr. Boehm's tales about his own family, growing up with his father, raising his kids, etc. Very few of the stories are actually about his PATIENTS. That's why I really found it tiring to read after a while. It was not at all what I wanted."
2,"Stinky scent, GREAT BRAND.","NATURE'S GATE IS ALWAYS AMAZING THE BRAND HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN. Except for this one shampoo. I'm sorry but this smells disgusting. Super dissapointed I payed for this. This is a wonderful brand, but this particular scent is awful."
2,Disappointing,"I am a shampoo fanatic, and I love natural products, so I was excited to give this a try. I really wanted to love it.This shampoo does have a wonderful texture. It's thick and lathers beautifully. It cleans well, but maybe a little too well for my thick, wavy hair. My hair was so tangled after I used this shampoo that I couldn't comb through it even after conditioning.I bought this partially based on the reviews that say it smells nice, but to me it smells like flea treatment. I actually had to double-check the label after I used it to make sure I hadn't accidentally bought a pet product. The fragrance lingered after my hair dried and even through my next wash with a different shampoo.I hear the other formulations are better, so I won't give up on this company. However, I've used and loved other Nature's Gate products (theC for Yourself facial serumis wonderful!), so I think this one just didn't suit me. On the bright side, I bet this would make a wonderful pet shampoo."
1,Product doesn't match with what they say,I asked for nature gate regular and that's what is shown in the product descriptionBut I got the tea tree shampoo which was leaked when I opened it
1,who changed my kuuduk???,"I agree that the ORIGINAL kuuduk was a wonderful, challenging, intelligent card game, but this new one from Mattel...Let me just say that when the game switched over from available at starbucks to available everywhere, the rules were changed and the game became an idiot game. Whoever at mattel decided that kuuduk had to be dumbed down clearly has no faith inthe intellect of the consuming public. BRING BACK THE OLD RULES!!"
3,B.B. King,"Outstanding musician, but this is not one of my favorite concerts by this legend, sounds to jazzy. Don't get me wrong, B.B. plays his guitar amazingly. Sure, buy it, every B.B. King's fan must have it!"
5,"Brilliant, insightful theorizing based on data","A very informative theoetical examination of what works in development based on thoughtful analysis of what has worked and what has not worked. Breaks the stereotypes of polictics and ideology that have been so central to development. Combines economic, political and social perspectives that remind me of the best of Max Weber. Wonderful book! A must read."
5,An extremely moving story,"I, too, could not put this book down once I started reading it. This story has a most authentic ring to it and moved me to tears quite a few times throughout. The story of Loyd's childhood is delivered without fanfare, yet it seems almost lyrical all the while effectively depicting rural life in the Midwest during the 20s, 30s, and 40s. Terrific and insightful characterization, too; I wanted to hate Ma and Pa but, as Loyd eventually did, I ended up feeling sorry for them and could forgive them in the end. I felt as if I had actually met most of these people described in the book. I'm grateful I picked this book up and recommend it wholeheartedly!"
2,nothing like ABBA,"Saint Etienne have never managed to create anything remotely complete as an ABBA song. Their wispy, fey sound might fool the casual listener into thinking there's a connection, but their appeal lies largely in their postmodern appropriation of pop traditions. And while Sarah Cracknell is a reasonably competent singer, she lacks the style and range of any number of vocalists. Try as I might, I couldn't find anything on Good Humor (sic) that resembled a great pop song: it's all so pale (like their earlier single Pale Movie). I hope the music fan from Rio wasn't too disappointed."
2,Not great,"I bought this album based on the fact that it had a neat cover and I had heard they somewhat sounded like Belle and Sebastian and Air. The cover is neat, but they sound nothing like either of those fantastic bands. I would say Saint Etienne sounds more like the Cardigans meet ABBA. Although I enjoy the Cardigans (not ABBA) I found this to be very annoying. Woodcabin is good, as is Dutch TV, but that is all. I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,Saint Etienne's best,"This is perhaps the most 'traditional' of Saint Etienne's many releases, and by far their best. Their other albums before and since have their strengths and very few weaknesses, but this one is essential. On some of their albums the various influences they throw into the mix don't quite work, but this album is a perfect mix, and the sound that comes out of the blender is completely cohesive. I don't really know how to describe it, but 'international pop' seems like a good phrase. That doesn't describe the sound as much as it does the sensibility. I guess all I can say is that every tune on this album is perfectly conceived and executed, with incredible vocals by Sarah Cracknell, and some really wicked and cutting and touching lyrics. If possible, I recommend hunting down the out-of-print two disc edition, which comes with the CD Fairfax High, which works on its own as a fine album. One of the best albums of the '90s."
4,Uneducated critics,"Any critic who would compare this group to Abba obviously does not have the mental fortitude to compete in an elementary school spelling bee. All Swedish music does not sound like Abba. The band is not Swedish, but the producer of this album is well-known to Cardigans fans...another band oft compared to Abba that sounds nothing like it."
3,"a nice album but a bit too ""sugary""","I read all the reviews for this album, and since I had enjoyed some of the songs on ""Tiger Bay,"" I thought I might try out the CD. There are some nice songs here, easy on the ears, but overall it's just a bit too ""sugary"" for my taste. Of course, if you like that type of music, then you'll probably really like this CD (I kept expecting to hear ABBA's ""Dancing Queen"" on this CD; that gives those who haven't heard this CD an idea of what the music is like). The best songs, in my opinion, are The Bad Photographer and Erica America."
4,Retro-licious!,Reinterpretation of retro groovy music with a nineties twist. A must have for twenty-somethings.
3,Saint Etienne go Americana,"Not as special a cut as Foxbase Alpha or So Tough, but seems a natural progression from Tiger Bay, with more emphasis on nice tunes and real instruments, and little use of the clever samples, sweeping soundscapes and North London-isms that made their sound so unique. It seems they've been spending less time back home and more on the road. The Americana references are sometimes embarrassing, but there are a lot of sweet tunes here. Mr Donut and The Bad Photographer stand out on that account. Others verge on insipid (Been So Long).Leaving the now over-populated euro-disco sound behind was probably a good move for them as far as preserving their own ""turf"". This album is no where near as original as the first two, but ought appeal stateside where the folks can't resist a good tune and traditional instrumentation."
5,TOP RECORD,By far one of the best records that I've heard in the last year. Imagine the Cardigans watching Austin Powers with Belle and Sebastian. A must have.
5,Put yourself in the best of humour!,"This is truly a charming, refereshing album, meant for you to soak up the enjoyment.All though it is by no means a ""heavy"" album, the lyrics do not insult your intelligence, and are especially thoughtful in the last song.Each song has a memorable melody and spiffy, sort of 60s-sounding arrangement.Fans of the Cardigans earlier work should certainly fall for this album as have I!Treat yourself today :]"
5,this CD is the bomb,"Do you dig the Cardigans? Do you believe that Pizzicato Five is the cat's pajamas? Then 'Good Humor' is the CD you've been waiting for. sounding eerily like the Cardigans at times(thanks to Cardigans producer Tor Johansen) and having learned from their friends in P5 to stop taking themselves too seriously, Saint Etienne and Johansen have concocted an elegant sonic soufle. If you like your pop music sugary sweet and smart, then BUY THIS CD!"
1,Not what I expected.....,"I read a lot of reviews on Bosu DVDs. I will say, after reading reviews for this one, I thought it was going to be very challenging, just I was looking for. It was completely the opposite. The reps for each exercise are way to few to have any effect and I thought the moves would be more challenging and even doing the workout along with the person in the DVD who is doing the advanced moves, it was still a very beginner workout. Maybe not beginner in the sense of getting used to the bosu, which really doesn't take long at all. I would say if you are someone who is just starting to workout or getting back into working out after being out a long time, then this would be ok. But for intermediate and advanced people, I would look into another DVD."
3,A little easy for those in great shape,"To many breaks and stretches. She stretches at the end so I worked through the stretches. And if you're in good shape, you don't need the rest periods. But if you work through them and always use the most challenging example, it's a good workout."
2,Bosu Reactive Strength and Power,"I've been meaning to reat this DVD. It's okay. I think the instructor teaches a little to fast for a ""home fitness DVD"".I wish she had more moves using weights.You'll want to have enough space in order to do the cardio moves."
3,So-So,This is an OK product but be careful. If you think you are buying a reading game or a read and answer learning tool- this is not it. This is merely a video lecture with some humor thrown in. It is not at all interactive.
5,"Millennium ""MANTRA"", A Game for the ENTIRE Family!","Finally a game for everyone ! No guns, no killings. There is nothing disturbing,frightening or repellent in appearance or aspect. MILLENNIUM MANTRA is a relaxing, fun, beautifully illustrated game. I find that playing, I feel peaceful energy and I feel invigorated! This has been played and enjoyed by everyone. From my grandson, to my 90 year old father! Thank you for finally making a fun, rewarding game for the entire family! I highly recommend. Join me and all the others who have gained positive energy while having fun."
2,"Disappointed with ""Huddle Fever""","As a life long resident of Lawrence, I was looking forward to reading an objective account of a place that I know intimately. Instead I found ""Huddle Fever"" to be offensively condescending. Particularly irksome was Ms Schinto's musings of how fortunate she was that her immigrant family ended up in Greenwich, Connecticut instead of Lawrence. The term ""huddle fever"" is itself a grotesquely contorted expression of what most people would describe as a tradition of strong families. Strong families, common to immigrant communities, can at times be oppressive, however, they are more often supportive and nuturing. ""Huddle Fever"" did not depict the Lawrence I know."
3,Good take on difficult subject,"The topical outline for this book is excellent. The problem is how do you create self-paced demo exercise files for such a complex product. Unless you have access to a SharePoint site (you can get free access for 30 days online), this book will be of limited benefit. Also, it is difficult to present end-user material without also presenting the administrator function of creating and configuring. If you are interested in learning just the features of SharePoint there are better books. If your company has SharePoint implemented or you can access a free site, then this book will prove helpful."
2,Not good enough,"I'm afraid that I was not as impressed as the other reviewers. The book failed to mention that you need to have InfoPath installed to run some of the exercises. There is little of how a real world configuration might look. It does give some ""click the screen"" simulations of what the program might do. But then, you could get the same thing by installing it yourself.It would have been a worthy effort by discussing the structuring of a business collaboration project, then explaining and expanding business information storage, retreaval and search to tie it all together."
3,NO CD,"This book arrived with no CD in it. The CD envelope in the back was unsealed and empty. Since I am in the middle of a project, and could not afford to wait while the book was sent back and the CD inserted and returned, I chose to try using it without the CD. I hope I made the right choice."
4,Good starting point for share point services,I think this book provides a good starting point for getting to know share point services. It really helped me to get started.The book is easy to read.
4,A reason why it may not be available,"I love this movie, one of my all-time favorite rock & roll movies. This is just a guess but I suspect the reason this movie is not out on DVD is the cost to the rights to the music used in the film are way too high for the studio that owns it to pay for those rights and to make a profit releasing it on dvd.Musical usage right were much less expensive 25/30 years ago then they are now. The original rights to the music may have been negotiated for film release, broadcast and VHS rights but since dvd's did not exist back then it may now be impossible for everyone involved to agree on a fair price for the rights. Too bad, no one makes money and we the viewers lose!"
3,Really excellent movie.,"This movie really needs to be put on DVD. I've seen it in the theatre back in the late 1978 and hadn't seen it until it appeared on HDNet on Sunday night (6/12). For those who have HDNet on their cable or Satellite system, here's a chance to catch the movie in it's pristine state during the month of June."
2,Not good,The picture was really grainy and it looked like maybe it was a copy of the real video. I paid 42.00 for it and I am pissed. This was such a great movie I should have known it would not be god because it's so hard to find. I was really disappointed. There were no credits on it saying who the actors were either.
5,Rave Review - and it isn't even out yet!,"""American Hot Wax"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I have a marginal quality VHS of it taped off the TV. I have been trying, literally for years, to find a legal copy. It was issued on VHS, then taken off the market with only a few copies sold.It's the story of Alan Freed and his first Rock and Roll Concert at the Brooklyn Paramount. The music is wonderful!: Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry...Lorraine Newman as an aspiring teen-age songwriter, Jay Leno as Freed's chauffeur...A must-see if you are into original rock and roll.Tell 'em to get that DVD out!!"
1,A Big Dud,"The acting is horrible. The guy who plays Alan Freed is a total bore! The movie seems to go on forever, putting you into a deep sleep until the final appearances of Jerry Lee & Chuck. Their perfomances lack any kind of enthusiasm. The only reason to watch this flick is the scene in which Alan has no money to pay Chuck and Chuck decides to go on anyway! What?? Are you kidding me?? What a crock! Any true Chuck Berry fan knows that Chuck doesn't go on unless Chuck gets paid.. and it better be cash! Why should the IRS get theirs? What bullshhhh! Leave this one on the shelf!"
5,OMG!!! To Die For...,I had these in France and I've been looking for them ever since. They are incredible.
4,Amazing stuff,"I feel about Melody Unit what I felt when I first heard The Pixies, Or Radiohead, or any band which made me think that there were still beautiful sounds which had not yet been recorded. I saw their show while visiting Seattle this winter, and Ive been forced to dub numerous copies for friends who couldn't live without their sounds after hearing them while walking past my dorm room or while driving in my car. I'm ecstatic to know that I now have somewhere to direct them to purchase their own copies of this fantastic CD which you should buy right now. Plus, I hear they're really nice people."
5,For those sympathetic to the cause of... truth,"This is an excellent book for concerned parents who preferfacts and reason to propaganda and hysteria. Unlike thedeprogrammers or ""exit counsellors"", Professor EileenBarker has no vested interest in attacking ordefending the ""cults"". She does not draw her conclusionsfrom ""discussions with current cult leaders"", either(anyone who can say that obviously has not read any ofher books). We're talking here about a lady whose researchinto the Moonies was perhaps the most extensivework ever done within the field - and ""discussionswith cult leaders"" hardly featured in it at all.Any thinking person will be impressed with thescientific rigor of Barker's work (""scientific rigor""being something Steven Hassan would not recognize evenif it came up and bit him on the nose), andher findings are made even more trustworthy bythe fact that she remains so obviously unimpressedwith the cults' doctrines.Highly recommended!"
1,"very poorly researched, don't bother","As valuable as it may be as raw documentation, the author should have spent more time researching a little more about the society she was visiting. It is impossible to avoid societal preconceptions, but the picture she paints of Venezuela from the moment of her arrival (or South America, as she interexchangeably refers to it) is shallow and uninformed, like a grotesque caricature.Key sources of such lack of research are demonstrated in mediocre references to Spanish (most words are incorrect in spelling, use and context), and incredibly poor information on population distribution in Venezuela or the true socio-economical situation at the time of the study. It is unfortunate that so much bias goes into what could have otherwise been an interestin study.I tried picking the book back up time and time again, but it's hard to read through the condescending, uninformed background of the author."
5,I wish I had bought this earlier,Covers all the bases as far as what you need to do to get into graduate school. I really wish I had bought this book at the beginning of me junior year at least instead of the beginning of my senior year. Very helpful!
3,Helpful resource,"While I found this book helpful in teaching undergraduates about graduate education in psychology, I also found much of the information out-of-date. In the 8 years since the last revision of the book, much has changed in the application process."
2,An esthetician's viewpoint....,"There is a lot of useful information in this book; unfortunately, Dr. Murad promotes HIS products at the expense of others. That said, this book was written by Dr. Murad and is ""The Murad Method"" for ageless skin. I am sure the folks who sell his line find this book helpful to those purchasing his products."
1,I was expecting some solution not catalogue,I think buying Dr.Murad's book is wast of money and time.I was expecting some solution to the wrinkles by buying the book. But is only a catalogue to Murad's products he sell.You have to a buy a chain of products mentioned in the book.
1,Wrinkle Free Forever: The 5-Minute 5-Week Dermatologist's Program,Buyer beware!!! This is just a written sales pitch for the doctor's expensive products. I felt tricked. It was a waste of money and I was very disappointed.
5,Great Story,"This is one of the greatest humanistic stories of all times. It is the very beginning of what college sports represent today and I am thankfull for the inovative thinking of Coach Haskins and the young men of Texas Western University (University of Texas El Paso), if it wasn't for them, I would have never received a basketball scholarship and earned a degree."
5,Number One Grade A,"Like all his other recordings I see no Mistakes.He's a very talented person with what ever he set's his mind to do.Weather it's writing,sanging,picking the guitar or playing the fiddle,he's a super gifted super star."
4,A winning historical effort!,"A winning historical effort proves that storytelling magic translates easily into contemporary tales. Rich with emotion and complexity on issues and situations where authenticity is a must. There is some smart, dedicated scenes about trees and if you enjoy more depressing historical truths, you'll find the arms sales to Israel which was met by chilly Ike-Dulles stern efforts a bit dishearting. If you like true historical facts, and a writer being a bit gutsy, this will be your cup of tea, it was mine. This wasn't read for film prospects, but for my own personal enjoyment. I do recommend it for a solid read."
3,Kindle edition has too manymistakes!,"While I have enjoyed this series verymuch, including this book, I wasdisappointed to find so many mistakes in the edition. There were somany words run together that it became distracting. Toward the latter half ofthe book, there was nearlyone per loc/page. I felt like wincing every time I cameacross one. Notonly that, but there was a chunk of text missing. Beyond sloppy editing!As for the story, it is funny and entertaining. The Poor Relations partners assist in a romance, of course, and Sir Philip comes up with another of his clever solutions. Not quite as complex a story as some previously, but still fun.Two stars knocked off for the terrible editing and missing text."
5,A rich collection The great masters are here,"This is a wonderful collection. The great masters of modern Jewish story-telling are represented here. I could quarrel with some of the selections, and would for instance prefer a different Bellow story. But there are also some of the great , great stories here including one of the masterpieces of the writer who I personally consider the greatest of all modern Jewish storytellers Isaac Bashevis Singer.The selection here is of one of his greatest stories, 'The Spinoza of Market Street.'Each of the fifty or so selections is briefly and competently introduced.A truly wonderful anthology."
3,"odd choices, but good overall","The memoir by Jerry Stahl that this movie was based on was first published in 1995, but most of the events described in that book took place in the 70s and 80s, thus I found the musical choices for this soundtrack to be a bit odd, if not inappropriate for the time frame. What you get here are typical late 90s electro-dance and alternative tunes. I suppose the producers/compilers wanted a relevant, hip and timely soundtrack for the year that this was released, but it certainly doesn't evoke any memories of Stahl's drug years. The songs on here by Moby and the Prodigy have already been done to death, so they don't have much appeal for me. I like most songs by Gomez but their contribution to this soundtrack, ""Get Miles"", is a yawner. But tracks by BT, Art Alexakis, and the Crystal Method are more welcome offerings. If you can find a cheap copy of this CD, go for it; there are enough interesting songs on here to justify the purchase."
3,"Great Movie, Not so good Soundtrack","Only Very good thing about this cd is art alexakis' song overwhelming, which is GREAT..."
4,Un buen disco para quién busca pop en versión salsa,"Saludos desde México.En realidad compré este disco por las canciones de Obie Bermudez y Thalia, y son buenas versiones salsa de sus originales pop. Otras canciones interesantes de este CD son la de 3-2 get funky y la de Ilegales. El resto no me importaban tanto. Sucede que existen otras tantas canciones ""salsa-pop"": las de Chayanne (cuidarte el alma, te echo de menos, y tu te vas que son de mis favoritas), de Ricky martin (tu recuerdo, tal vez), Sin Bandera (suelta mi mano, mientes tan bien y entra en mi vida), Luis Fonsi (tu amor, nada es para siempre), entre otras tantas. Pueden ver los videos en youtube. Los CDs relacionados son Baladas en salsa (o ""la salsa de hoy""), pop salsa hits y del pop a la salsa entre otros. Me pareció este un buen disco, aunque empezaría por los demás. Si buscan un CD del genero, este es bueno."
5,Queen of the Legal Tender Saloon,"An intimate portrayal of a young woman's pilgrimage to small town rustic Montana. Ms. Clarke captures the essence of this close knit community with endearing characters in search of good times amidst their struggles. A lively story with true grit, heart and soul."
4,Montana honestly,"What a wonderful idea: Montana through the eyes of a dental assistant. The Big Sky State is, after all, comprised far more of civil servants and teachers and CNA's and truck drivers than the cowboys and far-sighted writers that we tend to idolize. Thank goodness for a well-spoken author who looks at Montana's foibles through the eyes of a believable character. Thank goodness, too, for a fine portrait of a Montana town and valley. And bravo for the cover artwork. What a relief to find a bold artistic cover statement--as opposed to another look-alike muted dust jacket!"
1,Did not fit my Ipod shuffle.,"I bought this Item as a way to charge my Ipod shuffle my way to work. The part that plugged into the shuffle was so much smaller than the port that it wouldn't even click in. It would just slide in, and slide out. There was no friction what so ever."
3,Just OK,"The serial killer is one of the most twisted I've ever read about, but the plot didn't really pull me in. I did like the way that Matt is just a regular, flawed guy. He's not the kind of detective who pieces together unbelievable intricacies, and he doesn't use brute force to subdue anyone! Unfortunately, it's just not that good of a story. I would probably skip further Scudder books unless people tell me they are way different than this one."
2,A Disappointing book,"I am a Lawrence Block fan, I have all of his Matthew Scudder books in hard copy, but I had a hard time reading this book. He went into the mind of a psychopathic killer too much, where he used to let us into Matt's mind instead. A real disappointment all the way around. It's too bad too. I hope his next book is not made just for shock value as this one seemed to be."
4,Much better than Hope to Die,"This is a sequel to the horrible Hope To Die, and, fortunately, it's a huge improvement. Instead of using first person, Block tells the serial killer's point of view through third person. I'm not sure why it works so much better, but it does. The plot in All the Flowers are Dying is also much improved. It's a compelling story with lots of tension.The weakness continues to be the character of the serial killer. First of all, I'm not going to go out of my way to read about serial killers--not my cup of tea. But I don't think Block did a good job of making the character believable. He is totally evil. This makes him one-dimensional and not interesting.Still, this is a good entry in the Matt Scudder series. I'm glad Block revisited Hope to Die because the sequel is a worthy addition."
2,Not One of the Better Matt Scudder Novels,"Although I am a huge Lawrence Block fan, I completely agree with a few of the other online reviewers here who have stated that Block is not at the top of his game in recent years. ""All the Flowers are Dying"" was a big disappointment to me. Block is very choppy in his transition between first and third persons, and Scudder's narratives in this novel do nothing to help move the story along. Heavy focus on the killer's thoughts might have worked better had the killer been a more believable character. Much of the plot felt contrived and forced to me. The novel did pick up a little momentum toward the end, but even at this point the final pages had to rely on unlikely coincidences. I highly recommend going back to any of Block's earlier Matt Scudder Novels (""When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes"", ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" etc.)."
2,Matthew Scudder is dying a slow death,"I used to buy Block in hardcover but after the Turkey ""Small Town"" I just read library copies if I see one. ""Flowers"" here was on the ""New Arrivals"" shelf so I didn't have to spend a dime. Good thing too because Scudder is gone. Instead of the fascinating read of gumshoe evidence gathering via interview, we only get a psychopathic killer's mental ramblings. I think Block is simply tired of Matthew. He is killing him slowly by running off his loyal readers with the graphic murders, when what hooked us in the first place was Scudders logical process of uncovering the perpetrator. So Long, Matthew."
1,Book was a gift - Glad I didn't spend my money,"For Block's reputation and slew of awards, I was disappointed.I read a lot of crime novels, and enjoy the masters -- Leonard, Parker, the MacDonalds, Westlake/Stark, Healy, McBain, Emerson, Kaminsky, Dobyns, Mayor, etc., and none of their novels I have read included the blunders made in this one.* * * Spoilers * * *Just for example:The bad guy is a forensics savant, capable of teaching the writers of the CSI programs new tricks about leaving a crime scene evidence-free, yet he kills 2 victims on crowded subways and the author doesn't mention blood once -- not even on the knife the killer takes with him. The climax reads like a made-for-TV movie, where the intended victim hasn't been left alone for weeks, and, yet, just after Scudder and the intended victim agree that the killer is still in town and still after her, he leaves her alone to get the newspaper! And guess who is just down the hall at that moment? Please!"
3,"Black, Block","As opposed to film noir, this is definitely a book noir. A psychopathic killer with whom former police man, Matt Scudder, had previously tangled, is back on the scene and more dangerous than ever. An innocent man is executed for the sadistic torture, rape and murder of three young boys, unable to convince anyone of his innocence. The murderer who is a master of disguise, visited the man in his prison cell, just a few days before the execution, merely to gloat over how clever he had been in setting up this totally innocent man, just for the thrill of being able to do so. When the murderer decides to kill Matt and his wife, they are put in a siege position, in constant alarm and forever on super alert. The scenes in which the murderer describes what he IS doing, or plans to do, are horrific in the extreme...graphic beyond need and left me feeling quite sick. If this is the path that Mr.Block intends to follow, I won't be subjecting myself to any more of his books."
2,UGH!,"I have the highest respect for Block. He is a master. Maybe I am just getting old and cranky, but really!! The mind of a sadistic serial killer can never be a comfortable place to be, but this trip was over the top. We get it--without the endless sickening details. I finished it because it is Block-even if I think it is his worst in more ways than one."
2,Serial Killer?,"I have a lot of respect for Laurence Block, and I think he's done some great stuff. That said, I wish he'd do some more of it instead of grinding out books like All the Flowers are Dying. To begin with, the whole ""serial killer"" thing is a cop out. Although this one appears to tie in with the past, there doesn't really have to be any motive or reason or connection, just a ""crazy killer"" out there! Makes it a little easier to put together the story.Also, Matt's become something of a holier-than-thou pain in the neck since sobriety. Now he's started on smoking. I couldn't believe the subplot wherein a woman who wants her man investigated appears to be attracted to him mainly because he's a smoker. Kind of ridiculous. Of course, as Matt confides, he does plan to quit for economic and long-term health reasons--he just thought she needed to know that. Tongue in cheek or what?"
5,Scudder blooms brightly,"I had been disappointed in the last Scudder book. Well, not this one! Block creates a dual level of emotions. While Scudder seems to have taken on a fairly routine, non-threatening case, you know there is another level much more threatening and suspenseful. I did like that Scudder realizes he's not as young or quick, now that he's in his 60's, and that all my favorite characters were there. I will warn that there are some descriptions of graphic violence. My thanks to Mr. Block for an excellent read."
4,"Sit back, relax, he's a pro","Scudder is aging, but hasn't lost his edge. Neither has Block. A great bad guy. Enjoy."
4,Arguably his best Matthew Scudder book,"I have been hooked on Lawrence Block since the very first book I read. Since then, I think I have read every one of his books. The Matthew Scudder series has been a bit of a hit or miss. Some good and a few fairly bad, especially some of the latter ones. But this one is excellent. Quite possibly his best.I never read a book's or a movie's review before reading or watching it, because inadvertently people mention something that takes away the suspense. So I'll just end this by saying that the book has twists and is wonderfully dark."
5,"samsung dlp 50"" slim 1080P","just bought this tv a couple of weeks ago and the system is outstanding, color is unreal, shipping was ontime and the guys were great, my daughter says out of all the lcd's and plazamas she likes the dlp the best, i will buy from amazon again and i would recomend this tv."
4,Great TV,I can't wait till they start broacasting in 1080P. This TV is amazing. Sports and my PS3 look amazing. Notice what I can only call..Shiny faces with some Primetime shows. I don't know if this is because of upscaling or what. I still need to fool around with color settings to get things just right but so far I've been super pleased.
4,Had it for 1.5 years now... it's great!,"Pros:- Fantastic picture. Very crisp, colorful, and the blacks are black.- Great value. 50"" 1080p plasmas and LCD's are much more expensive (in 2008).- Horizontal viewing angles are surprisingly good. I can get at 45 degree angle before I start noticing a decrease in brightness. So, unless you have an extremely wide living room, no viewers will usually be sitting in the poor brightness zone.Cons:- Vertical viewing angle is not very good. If your head is above the top of the TV or below the bottom of the TV, you notice a significant decrease in brightness.-SLIGHT bow at top of screen. I can only notice it during letterbox movies. I thought this was a big deal at first, but then I realized I have more important things to worry about in life."
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY!,"DO NOT BUY THIS TV.... it is plagued with problems but the biggest problem is Samsung's customer service (which is non-existent). They are rude and refuse to back up their products. This is the second Samsung we have owned - both have been serviced numerous times. Granted, the picture when we purchased the tv was good and the selling point. If you purchase a tv every year, you'll be ok with the Samsung; however, if you intend to keep more than a year -- do yourself a favor and buy another brand. They only last 1-2 years MAX! The latest problem is thousands of white dots/pixels spread all over the screen. Apparently there are some class action suits for this problem but (go figure) our set is not in the list of class action suit serial numbers.I cannot stress enough to stay away from this company!!!"
3,"Good TV, but Viewing angle problems","I moved from 37 inch LCD TV, so this was big screen size change for me. Also I got it for about 1175, so it was good deal. Picture is good , blacks are really black.The only problem is that you get the best picture only when sitting directly in front of TV. Also one side of my living room is windows, that dims the picture if blinds are open. So to get best experience one has to directly sit in front of TV( about 20 degree) and close the blinds. This might be good for watching movies , but if you watch a lot of TV during day this is deal breaker. You cannot darken room for whole day or viewing time. Also we watch TV from variety of angles. Vertical angle picture dimming is worse.My earlier LCD did not have these angle and light problems to this extent. I think the problem is generic for DLP TV's and not specific to this model.Finally decided to return the TV as it had some defects also , and am getting an LCD.Samsung LNT5265F 52"" 1080p LCD HDTV"
5,What a bargain,I purchased this set from Amazon a couple of months ago and I am thrilled. no problems with the order or the shipment and i saved a bundle over the box stores. Advantages: bargain price; true 1080p resolution; light weight; long life led's; runs cool for longer life; beautiful picture; attractive cabinet. no sign of the 'hot spot' noted by pc world or the edge 'bowing' noted by one reviewer. speakers are better than i expected. only disadvantage i've noticed is common among dlp's: you must view the screen at no more than about 30 degrees off axis. no problem in our basement family room. feed this set a true 1080p signal and you'll amazed at what a gorgeous picture you can enjoy at such a reasonable price.
5,Samsung HLT5087S,"I trusted what I read of the review at Amazon.com plus my buying experiences in the past year, and wanted to give it a try for this my biggest buy at Amazon. All I can say is ""Amazon you can trust!"".The delivery is within the date of promise and the movers opened the box and put it where I wanted it and asked me to check if the TV set wasn't broken at all."
5,Great TV!,"I am very happy with this purchase. Amazing picture, amazing price! Sold for WAY more at local electronics stores, so it was worth the wait for delivery. Delivery was within a couple weeks as promised. TV was unpackaged and setup by the delivery crew."
5,"If you want an amazing tv for a small price compared to lcd/plasma, this is it.","I've had this tv for almost a month now. All I can say is wow.. Amazon shipping was amazing, shipped more than a week ahead of schedule. Amazon shipped through a 3rd party handler called Eagle. They were very nice and friendly bringing the tv in, unpackaging it, setting it on the stand, and connecting all the wires to it, and making sure everything worked before they left. The tv itself is amazing and is everything I could hope for in an hdtv. Easy tv menu to scroll between the inputs, multiple inputs for a variety of formats (3 hdmi inputs, multiple components), has a VGA connection to plug my laptop into, etc etc. The quality of the tv is gorgeous and actually looks very decent with regular cable broadcasting. I had people over for the superbowl in hd and got tons of compliments on this tv. Looks and feels like an lcd, but much cheaper in price. Trust me, buy this and you won't regret it."
5,"Amazing TV, Amazing shipping, Amazing deal","WOW! What a TV. I picked it up from the local hub (got there earlier than expected, and it was hard for me to set up a delivery due to MY schedule). My first Super Bowl in HD was awsome! Great price from Amazon, with free DVD player. I too did a lot of research and it all paid off. Picture quality is great even non HD (a small amount of adjustment is necessary to set up for individual situation). All around very happy."
4,LED DLP is the way to go,"I have always loved DLP televisions. However, the idea of replacing a bulb (and the price involved) did not appeal to me. Prior to this I had a Sharp 46DU. I went through four of those (banding issues) with no luck. So I got my money back an purchased this set. This DLP offers over 20,000 hours of life, and that's if you watch tv 8 hours a day, 7 days a week.Everything looks better on this set. The colors are vivid and alive, the blacks are deep and true, and the brightness is better than the previous LED model. My XBOX 360 looks amazing on here. Films, even classics such as Casablanca (HD-DVD) are true to life.Get this set like your life depended on it."
4,"Great TV, but didnt last very long",I purchased this TV in December of 2007. Love the TV. Fortunately I bought the 2 year extended warranty because I needed it right before the two years was up in 2009. The color wheel went bad and it took at least 2 months to get the replacement part. Here it is May of 2011 and now the color wheel appears to be bad again as well as a bad power problem. Every two years something is wrong. I expected a little more life from this TV.
4,Great TV at a nice price,"I have had this set for about a month now and I could not be more pleased. Amazon has a great price on this set! EGL delivery was prompt, no problems there. This tv has a small footprint in my viewing room, with the matching stand. I would recommend this set to anybody with light control problems, the anti-glare on the screen is outstanding! This a great set for movie buffs, virtually no motion blur and the colors are bright and vivid. The black levels are good but not great. The dislay can be a bit bright at times, otherwise i would have given this tv 5 stars. HD looks great, cannot wait for HD DVD!"
5,love my TV,I have had my tv for some years now and I would recommend this tv to anyone I have not had any trouble at all with my tv
4,Good product overall,"Good TV overall... some of the pros and cons:pros: great picture if you take the time to adjust it, very user friendly menus, no glarecons: sound could be better, viewing angle is very limited but i suppose that's common among rear projections."
3,Good TV for the price,"Got my 5087s on 10-17-07. Delivery was great and they set it up for me. Everything is great, even the sound since my apartment is small. HOWEVER...I thought I'd be lucky and not get bowing like other reviews stated, especially for the 5076s. I thought it would never happen to me. Well...there it was--Bowing!!!. It's the line on top when picture mode is on 16:9 and vertical bowing at 4:3. It is no more then 1/4 inch but still, I wish it was never there. I'm having the technician come over and see if something can be done about this."
3,Fan problems,"Yesterday i would have given this unit 5 stars, today we are at three.I ordered it from Amazon late on Wednesday (almost Thursday) It arrived in good condition on Tuesday. The picture was great and everything seem to be good. Saturday morning a message is on the screen ""Check The no. 1 fan."" I called Samsung and there was nothing they could offer but to set up a service call. So I have a three day weekend without my new toy.I haven't connected it to my stereo yet, we were waiting on a new cabinet we have order. Now I'm going to wait a few more days to see if they can fix this."
4,Great !,"A fantastic buy for the quality! It glows in the dark and matches any decor. It came with a very handy suede carrying case, which I really appreciate as I'm on the road a lot. There was a wide variety of screws and fasteners for installation, almost too many! The exterior solar paneling made placement on our deck a plus, without having to worry about running dangerous extension wires from the kitchen. My dog loves it!It's very porous however, and I would not recommend purchasing it in humid locales. The only drawback I've found to this wonderful TV is that it has no cable, uhf, vhf, S-video, USB, HDMI inputs or internal antennae. I use it primarily for a snowy ambience during the summer, as I'm a huge fan of cold weather. The picture is so clear, sometimes I sit outside in 90 degrees with my winter coat on! Brr!"
3,Great TV except when the scene is dark,"I bought this TV several months back from Vann's for $1200 including (no)tax and delivery. Price was good, delivery was prompt and the TV has been free of defects. The picture is fantastic when the scene is bright. Outdoor documentaries in HD are matchless. However dark scenes sometimes appear too dark. Though last night I watched The Departed with the TV set on Dynamic and the picture was quite outstanding throughout. I wish I could give it 4 stars instead of 3, but I can't seem to make that editorial change."
4,A great introduction to papermaking.,"I could only find one review of this book when searching on the web, which was pretty off putting, however I was pleasantly surprised with it. As a novice papermaker, with an interest in making paper and objects out of paper I found this book light hearted, interesting and an easy read, as well as being a good introduction to the craft of paper making. The photography and styling are beautiful, the projects may be simple, but they are also very inspiring. I think the concept behind the projects was to inspire with colours, textures and shapes, what you can acheive with all kinds of paper- to give people ideas, rather than challenge experienced paper crafters with complicated and unachievable projects. If you are looking for an easy intro to the craft of papermaking and some stunning and simple projects to make then this is the book for you"
5,Goes to the heart,"The best Ska/rock band in the world.Excellent on stage and the audience seemsto worship mr.Clean on tours.Favorit songs are: Mr clean / Dance craze / and all the othersHere's a little list of great scandinavianbands if that is something you seek:Him / Hellacopters / Turbonegro / Jens Lekman / Sahara hotnightsElin Sigvardsson / Nightwish / The Hives / Ace of base / AbbaRoxette / The Ark / Secret garden / Yngwie Malmsteen / The SoundsLene Marlin / Bjork / The Nomads / Entombed / Glucifer /Truckfighters ( only availible in sweden,i think ) /Little chris ( only availible in sweden,i think )....then the list goes on,and who cares..."
3,Just OK,Pennybridge Pioneers was the first Millencolin album I bought and I absolutely loved everything about it. The next album I bought was Same Old Tunes. I didn't think it could even compare to Pennybridge. I almost lost faith in Millencolin because of it. The reason why I gave it three stars was because I'm sure those of you who like more of a ska sound instead of a punk sound will like it better. I just bought For Monkeys and I felt that was alot better than Same Old Tunes and just under the quality of Pennybridge Pioneers. For Monkeys is making me look forward to buying Life on a Plate.
2,I think I got the wrong software............,"This software is a bit ""kiddish."" You have a limited number of editing options to choose from. If you are a true professional or semi-professional photographer, I would not purchase this software. I tend to be on the frugal side so I guess I got what I paid for."
2,Sidewall cracks,"First let me say, I've run a lot of Conti Gators, and love them. The Conti Sport contact came on my recumbent, a 20"" front and 700c rear. I clean my tires fairly often and last week notice the sidwall rubber where the logo is was detaching. I took the rear tyre off, and upon flexing the sidewall, noticed a crack in the rubber exposing the casing runing the circumference of the tyre. So I then took the front 20"" off and it had the same cracking in the rubber..These tires are less then 2 years old and with less than 900 miles, and have been kept in a dark garage out of the sun. The tread has held up well, and few to no glass cuts and no flats, and the tyre rides well, but boy am I unhappy with the cracking sidewalls! I've never had this happen with the Gators. I want issue free tyres on my bikes, so these have been replaced with other brands..."
3,not the best flat protection but it does have a good ride.,I commute to work (30 miles round trip). I wanted the best protection along with a good ride. I also use tire liners with the tires. After 300 miles of riding I had a flat. I used Armadillos in the past and i feel those tires offer a supierior flat protection. But the continental tire has a much better ride. So it seems to give up some protection for a better ride. Ill stay with the continental just becasue I prefer the ride. For the price its seems to be the better deal.
2,beautiful tire,"Unfortunately it is only 85 psi which relates to 85kg max weightor 185lbs. Go with the serfas tuono if you weigh more than 185lbs, it is rated at 100 psi which generaly translates to 100kg or 220lbs load capacity."
2,Does not fit 80GB iPod,"I've been using this case for 6 months despite the fact it doesn't fit the 80GB: there's a 1/16"" gap between both halves which doesn't allow them to click closed securely. Even with that gap, my iPod has at least been protected from being knocked around in my purse. Also, this case has allowed me to lay the iPod on my desk at an adjustable viewing angle, which is nice. What really annoyed me, more recently, is that the viewing area got badly scratched just by being inside my purse. At least it wasn't my iPod's screen that that got scratched... but I'm now back at Amazon shopping for a replacement."
2,Wrong Anchor size for bases.,"These are MacGregor bases and I got them with the anchors. These are great looking and durable bases. That being said, I coach a youth travel baseball and bought these bases and anchors to be put in ground at 65ft bases. When we went to 70ft distance, the anchors were already in ground. However, these bases DO NOT fit into any other anchors beside the ones that comes with them. For some reason MacGregor made these base poles at a slight larger thickness and anchors wider. So, these bases does not fit any other anchors in the market. Since the anchors are a little wider, any other bases will be a little loose. Keep that in mind when you purchase these."
4,Yet another D&D supplement?,"Well yes, but this one is actually good.Some interesting new character classes and some good takes on the existing core classes.The obligatory collection of new feats and spells, but these are actually pretty good.The latter part of the book deals with roleplaying and character building and complements the material in the DM'g Guide II on teamwork and organisations.I think this book will be good for my campaign, but what slightly dissapointed me was the space it gave over to classes from other supplements.I think the book should have stuck to core classes but that is fairly minor niggle."
2,Where's the Ninja?,"The book is pretty good. Except for one thing. I thas enhancements for all of the classes from the PHB and the ""Complete"" series- except the Ninja. What happened there? Book would get 4 stars, but I'd deducting 2 stars because of the snub."
5,THE QUINTESSENTIAL CHRISTMAS STORY,"This is my favorite Christmas story. It speaks to the hopeful child in all of us, who wants to believe in the unseen magic of a jolly old elf. It touches me every year since I first discovered this gem. Its power comes from the fact that it's a true story. Do something nice for yourself and read it."
4,WAY TOO BIG FOR LACIE 160 GB Rugged Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWire400/FireWire800 8MB Cache,"THIS CASE IS WAY TOO ROOMY FOR LaCie 160 GB Rugged Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWire400/FireWire800 8MB Cache PORTABLE external HARD DRIVE & ACCESSORIES.I exchanged the case for the SMALL CASE LOGIC portable external hard drive case and it is a great fit, secure, no jiggling about and bouncing around in the small case. Storage area for all of the cables and leads inside, too. The SMALL size is perfect for the LaCie Rugged!!!!!If you have a lacie Rugged drive, choose the small Case Logic--the medium case doesn't hold the lacie drive in place at all. Even with all of the cables and leads stuffed in beside the drive, it rattled around in the excess room.I'm sure this medium size is great for larger accessories like KINDLE. The Case Logic products I've purchased have all held up well. Nothing against this case. Just match it to the correct product to be stored inside."
5,great item!,"totally happy w/ this case. i use an external hard drive to hold all of my media. I.E. Movies/Pictures/Music/large files. so i am often carrying my external w/ my laptop. i had a 320gb lacie external that fit well, and i just upgraded to a 500gb lacie that's slightly bigger and it still fits well. keeps my external well protected while it's being transported and there's plenty of room for usb and power adapters! thanks case logic/amazon."
4,it's easy to use,"i'm very happy with this product, i can use it into my computer'bag and use a little space."
5,Great carrying and storage case,"I bought this because of having to transport my external to various places and in between storing it in my room. One of the problems is that in a hurry I tend to forget the USB cable or the power pack. With this I keep everything together so when I need to go I just grab it and toss it into my backpack. The case does not offer the best protection but it fits in my backpack along with school books with no problems, the bigger cases I can't do that.I just got a second external hard drive so I'm going to be buying a second case in the very near future."
4,Works perfectly for Amazon Kindle,"I'm very happy with the Case Logic Medium External HD Case...I purchased it for use with my Amazon Kindle.Kindle (in it's standard issue cover) fits in the main compartment of the case as if the case were made for it. It feels very snug and safe. I also like the smaller compartment in which one can put the charger and other accessories.Since this is a soft case, without any type of protective shell, you still need to be sure Kindle isn't crushed while traveling.All in all, I think this is a great product for use with the Amazon Kindle and I can heartily recommend the Case Logic Medium External HD Case."
1,Zipper failed after 2 tries,Two pieces of advice:1) For WD Passport hard drives this case is too big.2) This is a low quality case. Zipper failed just after two tries.
3,The Case Looks OK but....,Got this case for a 500Gb IOMEGA hard drive. It looks good but I never got to use it as the drive died.
2,Not a Hard Case,"Case Logic calls this case a hard shell case. It is anything but that. Basically this just a sleeve to cover the hard drive when transporting it. There is relatively little padding and the the shell, though rugged, is not hard. Its more of like you would get from a laptop case."
5,You'd swear it was made for the EEE,"On the recommendation of a website, I bought this as a case for my EEE subnotebook and it fits PERFECTLY. Unlike the official EEE cases, they don't have a compartment for the power brick, but this one fits the machine as well as many other goodies (power brick, mini mice, SD cards, flash drives). I can't recommend this enough if you're a EEE owner."
4,Nice Case,This case is well built and handy. Solid construction protects the contents and I like the side pockets and space for cords.
2,Too big and bulky for small drives,"I returned this item. I bought because it was a suggested companion item for the LaCie 160 GB Rugged Hard Drive USB 2.0/FireWire400/FireWire800, which I purchased for traveling. The case was far to big and bulky for the small hard drive for purposes of traveling. Because the hard drive was ruggedized, there is really no need for the case other than to store cables."
1,an insult to the computer world,This game defines bad. I would not except this game for free. It is one of the worst games I have ever played. If you get this game burn it it's much more fun than the game.
1,Don't waste your money,"This game contains minimal level choices, and campaigns are very short. There are no options for multiplayer, and you can't do a single match. Also, the graphics are very choppy. This game definitley went way below my expectations. Don't waste your money on such a terrible game, i am sorry i wasted money on it myself."
1,Worst game yet...,"Presentation The two page manual proves that there's not much here. If you're idea of fun is rebooting your system every three minutes, then this is the game for you. Now that's extreme! 1.0Graphics Extremely blocky, extremely outdated and extremely mediocre. 2.0Sound Sparse smattering of tiresome sound effects. The music is best described as ""Hobo Techno."" Big, phat beats with a synth harmonica. Look out kids, here comes DJ Boxcar Willie! 3.0Gameplay Game? Play? Those two words never entered my vocabulary after I booted up Extreme Watersports. I've seen free games that were better than this. 0.5Lasting Appeal Just like Joey ""Three Fingers"" Carpaducci, Extreme Watersports sleeps with the fishes now. 0.5 OVERALL SCORE (not an average) 1.0"
1,this game is a joke,"This is the most pitiful game i have ever played. I cannot even explain, or know where to start with how bad it is. save your money people!"
2,Okey Dokey!,"Short campaign, easy campaign, no multi player, and stupid single battles. Im a paintballer and this is definitly NOT realistic. It caan be fun sometimes i guess. But some stupid stuff is the fact you can have the best gun there is and the enemy will have the worst gun there is and theyll still win firefights! This game is fun for maybe a couple of hours but after that its all downhill, no wait its all off a cliff! Dont waste your money"
2,"Dumb game, but not a total loss.","In a way, this game kinda reminded me of tomb raider 1. The music is so catchy that you'll never know what will happen next. I mean, I was wicked amazed by how the AI come out of no where. Talk about dumb team mates though, when you tell them to go assult or defend, basically you're asking them to run into a brick wall and just stand there until getting shot. You're only chance to stay alive would be for them to follow you. Still, they tend to get lost and run into brick walls! And the fact that there is no multiplayer really makes this game suck. I have to say that paying 5 bucks for this game wasn't so bad, considering that the music is quite catchy, but overall, I wouldn't buy this game if you are a paintball fanatic."
3,Size Matters,I was somewhat dissappointed when I received this sugar because of the size of the box and the price. Wish I could purchase this for cheap in town. Ukrops a store in Richmond use to sell this. :(
4,perfect for my needs,"I needed something to keep my hair under control while driving my convertible. It works perfect for that. It fits snugly enough to stay on and doesn't give me ""hat hair"". Plus, my husband thinks I look sexy in it! Ha! Ha! I'm thinking about ordering another one in black."
2,didn't fit,The hat was cute but was way too tight on my head...even though it's one size fits most...so beware it may not fit if you buy it..I am disappointed because of that.
3,Cute hat,I got this for my daughter who is 10 and she really likes it. It's a little big for her head but is very cute!
2,Soiled,"The hat arrived with what looks like a pencil line across the brim. I tried erasing it, with no luck. Rather than deal with the inconvenience of returning it, I bought a few cute buttons and sewed them across the line. The hat is also advertised as 100% cotton but the lining is definitely not cotton; it appears to be polyester."
4,great,"its exactly like the picture and just wat i wanted. only negative is that its not adjustable. its slightly strechy but if u got a big head u may want to reconsider, it fits tight on me."
1,Not a cotton hat!!,"Although it indicates that this hat is cotton, it is NOT. I don't even think that there is one cotton fiber in this hat. After reading the reviews about the ""great quality"" and how people received compliments, I was shocked at the poor quality. It is a thin, flimsy, polyester hat. I actually laughed when I opened the package! My husband says that it should sell for 50 cents! Anyway, I probably won't send it back as it's not worth my time. Instead, I may use it for a costume. If you want a cute hat, don't buy this one."
2,"Good camera, until it broke","I bought this camera and was very happy with it. It took clear pictures and was very easy to use. Although it was small in size it got the job done. Then, after less than a month of using it, it simply stopped working. It wouldn't turn on, the LCD screen wouldn't show anything, and when it rarely did turn on, weird sounds came from it. I took good care of it, didn't drop it or anything of the like. After repeatedly calling Mustek customer service and finally getting help from them, all they said was that it had a malfunction and to ship it in, but we never got a new camera. It was horrible service, and a cheap camera."
5,It's a great mini-DV.,"I am using this as a substitute of my tape-DV.The good side of it is you need DV tape nomore,and also the size of the machine can be reducedto a minimum. Mmmm, the possibly downside of itis DV3000 didn't offer high resolution film mode-640x480, it's a pitty!"
4,Good for quick digital camera pictures,"I only use the digital camera capabilities for the Mustek DV 3000. This small digital camera is great for quick pictures that are going to be used for digital purposes and the software that comes with the camera is eay to use. Even the novice computer user can upload pictures with this camera. The downside if no flash and the video capabilities seem to capture very dark video unless outside or in a very extremely high light area. So I use this camera to take quick pictures of my kids or for items I am selling online, so this camera is very functional for it's quick digital camera functions."
2,Rubber straps worthless,The rubber straps that hold down the gun are worthless. They pop off easily and are lost. Not a product I would purchase again.
3,Not as good as some of the other Melissa and Doug furniture,"Although we have really liked most of our other Melissa and Doug dollhouse purchases -- we were a little disappointed with this set. After very little use the fridge is now unusable as the door has broken. Several chips were in the paint upon opening -- and, while this is subjective -- it just isn't very attractive. This is one set I wouldn't buy again."
1,very cheaply made,"The set came packaged very nicely, but upon opening the package I saw that the refrigerator door was unhinged and cracked. The kitchen table was chipped, the legs were uneven and I would not buy from Melissa And Doug again even though they very promptly replaced everything. If it was intended as a gift and the child opened it in that condition the child would have been greatly disappointed."
1,poor quality,"very disappointed in the kitchen set..was opened at a birthday party.the back of the hutch fell off,then we discovered that the door to the sink was cracked and then to top everything,the peg to the refrigerator was missing...very poor quality"
1,Not worth it,"My daughter got this as a gift for a dollhouse we made. Within a few hours of opening the set the table top fell apart. Additionally, one if the doors feel off with very little playing. Not worth it."
1,Their worst,"We're huge fans of Melissa and Doug stuff, but this set is junk. Broke immediately and is pretty ugly, too. Avoid."
3,Melissa and Doug's kitchen,"This was given as a gift, so it was opened before realizing the hutch was in many pieces. *The warranty is void after opening. It will have to be completely glued together. One refrigerator door did not have the pin that holds it in place, therefore we will have to improvise this as well. I believe that this was all caused by shipment method used. I would purchase this again, but only by personally viewing and paying the extra money to insure the pieces were intact."
3,gift for grand daughter,Bought as part of the Melissa &Doug Deluxe Doll house for gd that lives a couple thousand miles from me. They like the furniture and adored the house.
4,Realistic kitchen furniture,The kitchen furniture is great value as there are 7 pieces and they are all very realistic. The kitchen table arrived broken but i was easily able to glue it. My son loves playing with it.
2,Doll-House Kitchen Furniture,This product has not proven durable at all considering the doors on the furniture. The doors came off too easily but we've kept the remains as our daughters continue to play with them anyway. Too expensive for little durability.
2,"broke quickly, huge","I was so dissapointed that this set was HUGE. It also broke right away. Way over-priced too. Not so sure about Melissa and Doug. Some things are great, but a lot have broken or have some issue."
2,Poor Paint Quality,Price and shipping times were great but product was not the quality we have expected from Melissa & Doug products. The pieces in the collection were different shades of color and the Ice Box door was warped. Return policy was great as usual.We bought the set locally where we were able to see the product. Even then there was a large difference between some sets.
2,Melissa and Doug kitchen for Victotian dollhouse,This was a part of a birthday gift for our Grandaughter. It arrived with the refridgerator door cracked off with the hinge exposed and falling off and the top of the hutch separated from the base. There was not time to get another set so I had to glue it and use touch up craft paint. Not an easy fix! Very disapointed---the price far exceeded the quality!!!
4,kitchen set,"This set is cute as can be, but the refrigerator was broken when it arrived. I did not return it, I just fixed it so the door worked. All the other pieces were in good shape and so far have held up to my 5 & 7 year old granddaughters."
3,Good cookware set Missing cookie sheet & damaged pan,"This is great cookware but the set arrived with only one cookie sheet instead of two and the biscuit /brownie pan appeared to be second hand it was missing the label, dented and with a scrape in the non stick finish which drops it from a 4-5 star to a two three star in my book"
4,"If you can understand some french, it will also be funny...!","If you can understand the meaning of the lyrics of ""la lecon de Francais"", and ""ma langue au chat"", you will see how adorable those songs are, and even love her much more! And her voice...! She is awesome."
3,"PRETTY WHISPER-LIKE VOCALS,sadly not loud enough in the mix.","Her whisper-like,pretty soft vocals are the best and most appealing I ever heard in music,which sounds like pretty candy-girl pop.BUT THERES A MAJOR PROBLEM to this recording. The recording of her ultra-pretty-whisper-like vocals should of been much louder in volume.(not changed in anyway but louder in the mix). I found it very disappointing that the volume of her vocals were NOT AT ALL loud enough in wonderful emotional tracks like CANDYMAN,MIKE ALWAYS DIARY,ZOOM UP! and many others. Didn't the producers of this cd realize that her vocals were the MOST important element in this music and should of been considered as the lead instrument???(my heart is broken). That is why I gave this cd 3 stars."
4,ASIAN POP GOLD FROM A KKKKUTIE!,"Good to hear this album making the college/indie radio circuit. Soon it will make grand appearances at scenester parties. (Warning)There is a Sheryl Crow-like song on the album. But all else is 'all good.' Better than Cornelius, Capsule Giants, or anything else you are listening to from across the Pacific, so be about it and put some quirk in yer boogie!"
1,Annoying,"I really enjoy the Japanese pop-revival thing that's been ahppening lately but this was truly disappointing. The reviews were good but the music is, at best, ok, and the vocals get old fast. I am not a fan."
2,Information but not analysis,"I think the writer failed to pull through what he intended. This book does not depict the reality. Islam is the fastest growing religion and there are certain fundamentalist movements in different countries as authors explain. However, after careful analysis I came to conclusion that the situation is blown out of proportion. There is not such things or idea as Islamic Threat. Islam believes in peace and tranquility of all. Unlike Pax Romana, Pax Islamica clearly dictates the tolerance for coexistence for different religion. I do hope that authors pick title for their book more objective rather then to aim at high sales to meet the anti-Islamic sentiment created by the media in the west."
4,If you're an East Coast Jew you should read this.,"I never really understood the environment that my eastern European immigrant relatives lived in in the early 20th. century. This book, composed mainly of first person accounts and period photographs, has opened up their world to me. Focused mainly in the Northeast, it is a great historical document. I give it 4 stars because it could have better layout and organization."
4,the last place to go,"this documentary is one of eerie beauty and desolation. it's comforting that there are people who, on their own volition, choose to live in dutch harbor, alaska. i bought this video from Atavistic after reviewing the excellent CD soundtrack titled Dutch Harbor: Where the Sea Breaks It's Back. i am looking forward to seeing director Braden King's next film. his sense of visual aesthetic is rare. i agree with the reviewer from Canada that this movie is not for the attention deficit sufferers. the best thing about this film is that it ponders the sadness that here was a place on earth that was not ""civilised"" for centuries (possibly the last place in the continental US) and now is defiled by our need to exploit. it was truly the last place to go."
3,Useful product.,We moved to a bigger house and were able to unstack the set. It fit our W/D and raised to an easier level to change out the laundry.
5,Excellent,Excellent music done by David on his experience living an early dream of homesteading in Alaska. This is a fantastic album. The bear song is precious.
1,"please dont get these guys confused with ""the unicorns""","its sad that this ?band? shares their name with a great lo-fi band, the unicorns. i almost killed myself when i thought for a second that my beloved canadian indie band might have something to do with this crap. this kind of music is bull, go and listen to something better."
1,????,"this is so dumb. i thought that this had something to do with the unicorns who i listened to with my friend the other day. thankfully it doesn't, but sadly, i still had to endure listening to this."
1,Awful. Absolutely Awful.,"The kind of awful that makes you wanna travel back in time to a more pleasant moment.More seriously, all I can say is, wow. Ummm...Flossie and Unicorns, I could understand producing this weird crap while intoxicated. But then you packaged and listed to amazon. Really? No critical thought at all prior.....?Must be nice to be able to throw large sums of money down the toilet as will be the fate for this CD for anyone who purchases.At least we all know, objectively, what 'bad' music is now. Thanks, I guess."
4,Teen Digital Diva Rocks!,"This new software by Teen magizine and Girl Games is awsome! You can do makeovers, make your own fashion styles,review music, make you own magizine issues. It's all about you. This will make a great gift!I have it and use it everyday. If you know a teenager that needs a unique gift this is it baby!"
4,Great Picture Book,"The stories and jazz history are not as indepth as other books. But, in combination with another book, you get a better view of the history of jazz from the great pictures that this book contains."
1,Was not happy with seller.,"Love the book, but two pages within the book are unreadable due to excess ink from the original printing of it. This should have been disclosed before I purchased the book. Not happy that this information was withheld."
4,Pleased with Ask Your Angels,I had good service.This book arrived in acceptable condition.It was what I ordered. It was a good price.I am pleased.
3,weakest effort yet,"This album deserves 3 stars only because of Fulks' consistently superior songwriting. As a recording, however, it is easily his weakest effort. He has abandoned his nostalgic-country sound for a nostalgic 70's-80's punk/pop sound...not really an upgrade. I'm not really a big country fan and I prefer my music to rock, but Fulks' vocals and songwriting are perfect for country and his first 2 albums were some of the best work in that category for the last 10 years. His incessant screaming and over-usage of the 80's guitar sound do not serve him well on this last album."
3,Glass candies,"The product is nice, but two of the ten pieces (including our favorite one) arrived broken. Despite efforts to protect the fragile pieces, the ends snapped off in shipping/processing somewhere."
3,"World History, etc.","The Book:Very brief; but OK for an overview:Pros: Covers all know human historyCons: As the text rambles a bit describing a sector of history, frequently events are mentioned in name, without sufficient - or any - description.Overall: The authors are trying to cover too much with too little space. Nonetheless, if one wants to know about an historical event or period, this book provides that. For a generalized overview of World history, the book is valuable."
2,Outdated!,"Originally written in 1966, ""revised"" a little in 1979. Just a little bit of history has happened since then!"
3,nike men's oregon watch,"Watch looks good, but we have already had to replace it after having it for only 2 weeks. The battery just died. They sent a replacement the very next day after calling...very prompt!! However, the replacement watch has had one ""incident"" of stopping. After we re-set it, is has been fine. Only had this one for about a week...Hopefully, it will be OK. All in all, I would say this is not a watch that is made very well based on our experience with it."
5,Great little toy to keep in the diaper bag,"Lets start with I LOVE Melissa and Doug toys! Always so well made and I don't worry about all the lead and cadium paint problems that keep popping up with toys made in China. I bought this for my 1 year old and he loves to open and close the barn door. He is so happy everytime he opens a door and sees the different animals. I love it because its small and quiet so I can throw it in my diaper bag as an ""emergency toy"" to keep him busy while out and about."
4,"Put this one on your ""to read"" list ....","Wow!!!!!!! A Fool's Paradise is captivating, heartwarming and certainly ""takes you there"". Ms.Wilson did a remarkable job of allowing me to enjoy my own memories as each related to different events in the story. For my fellow Jamaican's and other Islander's this story will make you home-sick with it's wonderful reminders of ""island life"". For the rest of the world, this will help somewhat to enlighten you as to what our beautiful island and natives are like. It was hard putting this book down and definately leaves one hoping for a sequel. Thank you Ms. Wilson..."
4,Sites on Jamaica,"Although the book starts off slow, it becomes a page turner. It was difficult to put the book down. The calloquial flavor was refreshing, there is glossary for those who may need furhter interpretation...you go girl...Thank you Nancy for taking me back to a nice part of my youth."
5,Don't sleep on this Island novel!,"Where do I begin???? This first novel of Nancy Flowers-Wilson should not be taken lightly. Not only was it a page turner from front to back, but it made you feel like you were really there. You could almost reach out and touch the characters as she made you feel exactly what they were feeling. The descriptions were so for real that I could even begin to see the characters. In no way was I ready for the ending that was in store, so please have a box of Kleenex handy as things can get very emotional. Being of the Jamaican decent, this book really took me home, and for those who are not from the Island, you too will feel what it is like there, and will be able to relate in many different ways. The author has to eventually give us a part II to this in the near future. Good work Mrs. Flowers-Wilson, I can't wait for the next one."
5,Hot,"I couldn't put this novel down..The smell of down home jamaican food and the sounds of reggea filled my head as I read. Each of the characters reminded me of family members and friends...and ho, the drama!! The ending is definetly a surprise..this is a must read."
5,want to have fun? read this book.,"I think Mr. Vilk knows his genre very well and has executed it perfectly. I was hoping for a good action-adventure story and that is exactly what I got. I absolutely loved the central idea of the Golem itself. Not just the history behind it but the imagery the author creates with it. This supernatural element is blended very well with the tried and true aspects of a ""dirty dozen"" movie. In fact, it's very hard to read this book and not imagine it as a film, simply because of the imagery created and the pacing set by Mr. Vilk. I actually wish the book was longer but maybe I shouldn't have read so fast. (I couldn't help it). I hope the author writes more stories of this type."
2,Reads like a bad movie,"I can't believe how many good reviews this has. This also taught me to stop buying anything based on a Rollins recommendation. Horrible character development, accelerated and undeveloped plot, cheesy writing; the only reason I gave it two stars is that it was less than 200 pages so my suffering was limited."
3,Pretty Good,I purchased this book on a recommendation and I was impressed because the action comes quick and the story has a decent ending.
3,Nice book but nothing special.,"I enjoyed the book, the story or a variation has been told many times before. Entertaining but not ground breaking. I believe the author could have developed the characters much more."
1,MISLEADING!,This program DESTROYED my computer. It is a destructive program that wipes out your hard drive completely. My computer died and ended up in the shop.
4,"Great Program, but FREE version available","It is true that your data or files are not completely deleted when you format your hard drive. You can actually retrieve some of the files or datas even in DOS-mode. But this WipeDrive 3.0 actually erases all the data in the hard drive. It is indeed impressive. Even so, because it meets the standard of Department of Defense (DoD).BUT, if you are a casual computer user, just want to sanitize and clean your hard-drive more than just a FORMAT level, you do not need this program. You can get FREE utility via download. Try free Active@KILLDISK version 3.0 (www.killdisk.com). But if you absolutely have to destroy all the data because of its sensitive materials, you should get this program. Note that FREE versions do not meet the DoD standard, however, it does more than regular FORMAT.In sum, WipeDrive 3.0 indeed does what it claims. BUT for casual users, FREE utility in the web is more than enough."
3,Folks - it works,"Most intermediate users will be fine with this Hard Disc and Storage cleaning utility. No it's not super easy and bug-proof - yes, it does take time to completely erase/clean media storage to DOD standards (12X overwriting!!!). However, if you have some really sensitive information on your computer that you want removed, this software will get it scrubbed clean - no worries. Warning: if you are a beginner user - take your computer to a shop and pay to let them do it. Also, if you use a really old and outmoded operating system (Windows 98?) you may want to try something else. I used it on an XP and a Vista computer and had no problem."
2,Can't say if it worked...,"Can't say for sure if this program worked, because the old computer that I tried it on ceased functioning after I started the program. Well, it did destroy any information on the hard drive... but a hammer would've gotten the same end result."
1,CAUTION!! Could be an expensive experiment,"I bought WipeDrive to completely remove data from a laptop that I intend to donate to a local charity. I didn't want anyone to be able to find personal and financial data that had been on the computer. I was able to download the program and when I had difficulties (the first attempt at creating a bootable disk failed), White Canyon responded to my inquiries in a timely manner with the suggestion that I just discard that disk and try again. However, after successfully making a disk and using WipeDrive, my computer cannot be re-booted. I have tried all remedies given on the White Canyon website knowledgebase and the repeated instructions from their techs. They eventually suggested that I contact Microsoft or Dell as they could not offer additional help. After much run around from all - I am paying a local computer company to fix the problem. I'm sorry I didn't just start there!!"
2,A missed opportunity,"The book (third edition)is a treasure for those who like to scan the views of well-know public figures (Leon Trotzky, George Kennan, Winston Churchill, etc.) and scholars (H. Stuart Hughes, Walter Laqueur, Francis Fukuyama, etc.) on topics of general interest (Bolshevik Revolution, Holocaust, European Unity, etc.) pertaining to the 20th century. The book's title is ""An Age of Conflict."" The perhaps most traumatic conclict in the know history of humans is World War II. Reading the book can leave one wonder whether it ever occured. The war receives mention in chapters entitled ""The Nazis"" or ""Resistance or Collaboration,"" but the contributions by the various authors lack overarching coherence because there is no overarching plot to be found of this event in this rendition of the age of conflict. As a result, the book should generate much confusion among students of history who are not familiar with the subject. Others may indeed learn from it."
4,A Great Microscope for a beginner/intermediate,"I had not looked in a microscope for 40 years, but I was fascinated by them then, and I guess it carried over to middle age.This microscope could be stronger, but it is adequate for my purposes. Let me just warn whomever out there that wants this microscope; avoid looking at pictures from microscopes that are out of our league, like the electron microscope. You won't look at this microscope the same way.I do regret not splurging and buying the microscope with the 100x oil immersion objjective lens, but this microscope does its job, is easy to use, and it's great that it comes with its own illuminator.Bottom like, this is definitely the microscope you want to start out on."
5,"Substantial, easy to use","Great scope for the money! This scope works just like the one I used in high school and is durable, easy to use & worth every cent. There is no light source (good b/c I would forget to turn it off), but a mirror, so good lighting is needed, but doesn't pose a problem. You should order it with a set of blank slides b/c you will definitely want to make your own. My kids in 1st/2nd grade love it, altho I do the focusing (otherwise they'd crack the slides). Comes with a heavy plastic cover. Fine focus knob works well."
1,Unable to see anything clearly...obviously defective,"After spending a lot of time reading all the reviews, we selected the 500x Celestron. Shipment was quick by Amazon. We were so excited to view our ""puppy seeds"" (sperm from stud dog).. but, alas, the quality of the lens or something in the microscope prevented any clear picture. To cross check, we set up a borrowed microscope of similar power and could see the little guys very clearly. We packaged up the scope and are sending it back. Looks like you get what you pay for....Poor quality."
2,Fire Hazard,Well I was hoping the review about Fire Hazard was wrong when I ordered this as I read all the reviews that were on at that time. However my experience was that the slides arrived damaged and the electric illuminator had the burning smell and was defintely overheating. This is the only item that I've ever actually returned to Amazon in the history of all items I've ever ordered from Amazon. Without the damaged slides and the overheating problem I think it would be a wonderful item however. Damaged Slides are easy to replace however the overheating issue is a very serious issue as it could catch on fire and cause your house to burn down or wherever you are using it. I hope to one day be able to afford one of the $500 - or above Microscopes as I'm still very interested in a microscope. But in the meantime I will choose to live without as this microscopes overheating problem is too dangerous.
3,fire hazard,"I was so excited about this microscope. I read the entire manual and set the microscope up... and it almost caught my house on fire (luckily however, I could smell something burning and quickly shut it off and removed it from where i was working)... I used the electric illuminator provided with it... it gets so hot it poses a fire hazard! there are no warnings regarding this on the product or in the instruction manual... so beware of what you have the light source near or touching.other than the fire hazard light source... it seems to be a great microscope..."
5,Amazing Microscope!,This is an amazing microscope for the price. I looked at other microscopes and similar ones start at $300. It is actually just like the microscopes I used in college. Great for those who want a good microscope but don't need a fancy expensive one for more serious use. Very solid and durable. Excellent buy.
5,Powerful Microscope,I bought this as a gift for my grandson. I wanted a sturdy yet powerful microscope that he could use all through high school even. I believe I found it!! This microscope has a metal body and is hefty. It is well worth the cost. This is a powerful microscope that will follow him through high school and maybe even into college. It also came with many accessories..slides and tubes and an instruction booklet that was very informative. Overall...most excellent!!
2,Not as good as I hoped,I hoped this would have common language and translation on one diagram but they are the medical terms with one poster in English and the identical poster in Spanish.
4,Jointer,Works good. I use it to reset the knives in my jointer. The requirement of additional words is not necessary.
2,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD,These finger things are really bad. You can't keep them on your fingers they keep slipping off and they give you horrid calluses.
1,These suck,"They hurt your fingers, slide off, and give me the heeby jeebys!This is beacuse they're like claws and they're really strange. I like the plain old stylus much better. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on these."
1,Total waste of money,"This was a total waste of money, one size was to small , another to large. My order was duplicated and no return label was included."
1,One Star For The Idea.,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR HER BIRTHDAY. I HAVE WATCHED HER TRY TO USE IT BUT LIKE ME, BECAUSE I TRYED IT, IT DID NOT FIT ANY USABLE FINGERS AT ALL. EITHER TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL. NOW FOR ANY INVENTORS OUT THERE. THIS IS A GOOD IDEA BUT IF THE FINGER PART WAS RUBBER ALMOST LIKE A GLOVE AND JUST THE END WAS PLASTIC OR A HARDER MATERIAL , THIS PRODUCT WOULD WORK MUCH BETTER. ANYTHING LIKE THIS SHOULD BE MORE LIKE AN EXTENSION OF THE FINGER OR HAND NOT LIKE THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC NAILS YOU WEAR FOR HALLOWEEN."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"AFTER WAITING FOR NEARLY TWO MONTHS AFTER I ORDERED. THE VENDOR INFORMED ME THAT IT MAYBE A FEW MORE MONTHS BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE ANOTHER STATUS ON MY ORDER. I'VE SINCE TALKED WITH OTHERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND THEY SAY, ""THE STYLUS' ARE ABSOLUTELY USELESS"". I CANCELED MY ORDER THE NEXT DAY."
3,Printed on,"I wanted a flag for my kayak that was light and dual sided. I like the design but I was a bit disappointed to open the package and find that the manufacturer of this flag doubled up on the fabric, so it's stiff and a bit heavy. The design is printed on both sides with a rubbery paint, so it's not part of the fabric. I was hoping it would be silk-screen dyed into the fabric and only one layer. Oh well."
1,Cookie Cutter Bio,"This book reads as if were written in a week. It is truly a cookie cutter biography, full of copious quotes from old movie magazines. What a disgrace to the memory of the great Bobby Darin. Awful."
2,"Okay book, but I was disappointed","If you're a huge Bobby Darin fan, you will probably find this book more interesting. I liked some of his songs, but wasn't necessarily a huge fan. The book has a lot of quotes, but I would have preferred more narriative from the author."
4,"Decent, albeit slightly dry, bio of the great Darin","Any bio on Bobby Darin is welcome and inherantly interesting, and this one is respectable if a little dry. Not the best, Dream Lovers has that honor, but still recommended."
3,Bobby Darin: A Life,"Bobby Darin: A Life reveals the rollercoaster ride that was Bobby Darin's Life. Born Robert Walden Cassotto, May 14th, 1936 he truly came from humble beginnings in the Bronx, to a career in popular music, the movies and headlining in Las Vegas. The stories are all here. His marriage to Sandra Dee to his last days in Vegas, doing shows with an Oxygen tank backstage so he can catch his breath as he struggled with his heart condition which would lead to his death at the age of 36. Some very intersting stories with some of the biggest names in showbiz. Well worth a read."
4,The best biography of Darin so far!,"This book is well-written, insightful and the author did a great job of giving us a glimpse of this complex man's personality. Well done!"
4,Comforter is Pretty Nice for the Price,I got this on sale and it is pretty nice for the price. It is not quite as fuffy and full and some comforters but it is light and does a good job. I just like comforters better than heavy blankets!
3,Ran very large,"Moccasin was very plush, and seemed well made, but I wear a 7 1/2. I ordered an 8 as the instructions said to order up. But it was so big I couldn't walk in it."
5,YEAH!,Yeah my daughter wears them all the time even with jeans to school! She has always liked this brand as they last!
3,pointy toed slippers,These slippers didn't work for me. i need a wide toe box. i can't say i have ever seen such pointy toes on a slipper.
5,Minnetonka moccasin,"These moccasins are very comfy and warm. I bought these to replace my other Minnetonkas that I had for over 20 years. Yes, they are a little more expensive than a lot of other slippers. However, it's been my experience that the $10 or $20 slippers last maybe a year or two. I expect these will last 20 years, just like my last pair."
2,"Too much waffle, not enough meat!","Did I listen to a different tape from the one that most listeners awarded five stars? I found it full of new age waffle that certainly wouldn't help me prepare a speech. I did find a few useful tips on tape 2, but it was a long time to wait!"
4,This is a beautiful coat but it runs very small,"I truly wanted to keep this coat but it's too small. I ordered a size ""L"" and I normally wear a ""M"". I could barely zip it up. The zipper was stressed. Forget about wearing a sweater under it. There's no room! I'm 5'6"" and weigh 155lbs. It has two deep zippered pockets on the sides and two deep pockets inside (one of them has a zipper). I don't want to return it but there is no way I'll ever fit into it. I can't exchange it because they don't have this color left in a larger size so I must return it. Be forewarned, this coat runs very small, especially in the chest. This coat was made for someone with a very small bust."
1,Worst Downproof,"I brought this coat for my wife two months ago. I have to say the qualtiy is really disappointed, expecially downproof.I really doubt that it passed physical downproof test. Goose down came thought interior fabric and sticked on all over the cashmere sweater. I would like to post a photo for this when I figure out how, so everybody can take a seriouly consideration before you buy it."
4,Fun Stuff,"This program works as advertised. I bought it because in addition to warping still images, it will create videos with varying degrees of multiple warps. This feature allows a series of key frames with the (multiple) warps set as desired, and also adjusting the duration between successive key frames (number of frames).I was happy to learn that it uses a standard video format, *.avi. This is better than the Kai Power Goo prgram which uses a proprietary format, so the KPG videos can only be played back within the program, rather than being available for mixing with other videos.I held back one star because of the non-standard interface - it works, just takes some getting used to and referencing the Help file."
3,Content fine - printing terrible,"I've never written a review of a book based on the quality of its of printing before, but here I am compelled to. It looks it a 1942 first edition was scanned at low resolution and then printed with a clapped-out inkjet. Every letter on every page has a little flaky shadow below it. Weird thing is on the imprint page is says ""Manufactured in the USA"" - sigh.I suppose it shouldn't stop one from buying the book as it's obviously not going to be read like a novel, but it wasn't cheap so the quality can't be ignored. Shame on Simon & Schuster for putting this in customers' hands.Edition info: I ordered this in October 2010 and it is the edition copyright 2002."
5,A Helpful Guide to Men's Health,"I got the book to restore peace to my health club workouts. As my friends have turned 50, many have been asking ""Dr. Joel"" about prostate cancer. I'd be glad to answer, but it's not exactly my end of the body, since I'm a dentist. I read the two chapters on prostate cancer, but then I went back to read the rest of the book. I don't want to be an instant expert, but I now have a quick answer to all of the questions: read The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health for yourself. It's really an excellent book."
5,Great DVD,"This DVD is great. I am so happy that S club is getting more stuff in the US now. This dvd is great. The music videos on here include Don't Stop Movin, Have You Ever and You. So if you haven't got the singles of these cds with the music videos on them then go out and buy this dvd. It also has live performances of Don't stop movin and Reach from the s club party live 2001. Then this dvd has got an interview of S Club and it shows clips from the 2002 Carnival tour. This is really a great dvd and if you are an huge s club fan or just an s club fan you should definetely pick this up and add it to your collection"
5,S CLUB In the US!,Ok I went out and got this the first weekend it was out. And I just have to say that it is really good. I think that it is awesome that S CLUB is bring their stuff into the US. But even though Paul Left the Band And they now call themselves S CLUB they are still going strong. Dont Stop Movin the Video is really Good. You is kinda cheesy but its ok then have you ever thats probably the saddest S CLUB song yet but the video is really good. Then there is Dont Stop Movin (Live) that is taken from S CLUB PARTY LIVE: S CLUB's First Tour in Europe. Then theres Reach (Live) thats also Taken from S CLUB PARTY LIVE. Thats a really Good Song.
5,S Club: Don't Stop Movin' DVD,"This is the S Club DVD. It features videos for the #1 singles: Don't Stop Movin' and Have You Ever, and for the #2 single 'You' it also features a performance of Don't Stop Movin' and Reach from the S Club Party 2001. It also shows behind the scenes of their second tour, S Club Carnival 2002. Buy this today, for 10 dollars it is deffinatley worth it. Dont miss S Club's new series: Viva S Club premieres September 20th. And their new album out this fall. and their movie premiere Easter 2003 also in April their third tour S Club United 2003, their first tour as a 6.. unmissable"
5,WOW! GREAT BUY !,"I totally recommend this DVD, the videos and live performance bring da house down !"
1,black chain,"THE WATCH PENDANT IS JUST FINE, HOWEVER THE CHAIN TURNED BLACK WITHIN TWO WEEKS. YOU MAKE THE CALL ?"
2,Kindle edition is a mess,"The book, as it stands, is fine I suppose. But it's difficult to determine this with all of the typos and formatting errors that exist in the kindle edition. Words were spelled wrong, there was poor grammar, and formatting issues that separate text for clarity that exist in the printed book are all gone and corrupted in the kindle version. There doesn't seem to be any other way to address this on amazon, so here's my review."
5,Each one a morsel to savor,Excellent stories - Gay has the rare ability in his writing to divulge a person's core. Sometimes we may not like what he shows us but seldom do we find it inauthentic. He shows us the truth in all its forms and never blinks. So we don't either.
2,waste of money,"I got this chuck to use in my screwdriver gun, this chuck is way out of center, you can't drill straight with it and drill bits smaller than 3/16 are probably going to break due to the wobble, dont waste your money unless you don't care if the holes are out of center"
3,Learn to love it?,"""For The Kids"" gets a mixed review in our family. My husband and I love it (5 star) but my three year old daughter and my two nieces (age 3 and 5) do not like it (2 star). I am hoping that my daughter will like it once she is a bit older but for now we will be listening to Raffi...over and over again."
4,Lovely music,"Not just for kids, this CD boasts some of the loveliest music we've heard in ages. My 2-year-old is especially fond of BNL's ""La La La La Lemon"" track (although she still prefers Bert & Ernie's original rendition)...but this CD isn't just for kids; my 15-year-old loves it, too."
1,A real disappointment,"I've purchased several kids disks by adult artists for our daughter. This one was really bad. It had two good songs on it; the rest she always asks me to skip over. Sarah McLachlin's entry ""The Rainbow Connection"" isn't good enough to be called whiney, it is simply pathetic. Ivy's version of ""sing"" is if anything worse than the saccharin original.Barenaked Ladies LA LA LA Lemon was alright; Five for Fighting's ""Hoppity Song"" was really good. That's it. I love Tom Waits; he doesn't belong on a kiddie disk. At least, not with the song he had on this one.Go with Garcia and Grisman's ""Not for Kids Only,"" or They Might Be Giants ""NO,"" both of which are excellent. Skip this one."
2,Dull and bland,Barenaked ladies was the only fun song that my daughter liked. Otherwise we both were underwhelmed.
5,Keep your kids singin!,"My 3 year old son received this CD as a gift. I love it, he loves it and our 15 month old loves it (or at least all the energy generated by everybody singing!)I love hearing some of my favorite artists lend their talents to such a great project and my son loves the kid oriented aspect of the music. The Hoppity Song is our absolute favorite - being replayed over and over..... and ...... over.There is a great variety of music styles on this CD and should have at least one favorite song for everyone. I would recommend this CD to anyone with little tykes rolling around in the car with you....OR for anyone that just likes fun, entertaining music."
2,Not as great as I had hoped,"I bought this album because I like a lot of the artists that contributed. I ended up only really liking a few of the songs. My daughter, who is five, thinks it is ""sad songs."" Maybe it is geared for older kids. I recommend listening to all the clips before buying to make sure it suits your taste. I clicked on one, loved it, and found out it is the only song I love on the whole thing!"
5,The BEST cd we own!!,We have *many* kids cd's (I have 3 boys under the age of 7) and this is by far our favorite! I can't imagine how anyone could give this a bad review. My favorite is The Rainbow Connection--the most beautiful version of it I have ever heard--it almost brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to it. You know a children's cd is good when you listen to it even when the kids aren't in the car with you! My boys love the La La La song and also #7. I highly recommend this cd!
3,It's a good one!,"This is a really good cd but not my favorite kids cd. You can only listen to Sarah McLachlan sing ""The Rainbow Connection"" so many times. On the other hand, my 7 year old daughter and I could sing ""The Hoppity Song"" all day! It's great, as is ""Mahna, Mahna"" and ""La La La La Lemon""."
3,lots of lullabies and slow songs,"it puts my 1 and half year old to sleep--but only by the end of the CD since the slow songs are interspersed with the more upbeat songs. Kind of an odd mix, really. All of us, my little guy included, like They Might Be Giants 123 way better--both for their catchy, clever lyrics and upbeat music."
5,"Kids love it, Dad loves it","Bought this for Dad, from kids who has reached him limit in listening to kids songs in the car. They all like it!"
5,Great gift!,I bought this as a gift for a one year old with a 6 yr old sibling...they drive a lot with mom and so far it's a crowd pleaser!
5,great CD,"I love this album! The songs are done well,with musicality. So many kids' albums kind of dumb down the music arrangements, which is what makes gorwn-ups nuts listening to them over and over. Not so with this CD."
2,"My kids say, ""No!""","My kids (2 and 4) say ""No!"" when I try to put this on. The music is sweet but a lot of it really isn't for kids - ex Sarah McL's version of the Rainbow song, lovely, but rather sad, actually. I don't mind listening to it, but they will have none of it."
3,Not as annoying as most little kid music,This CD is not a high-pitched kiddie CD. It has great artists and is quite enjoyable.
2,Really Weak Compilation,"There are very few songs I like here, and my kids always groan when I put it on, they like it even less than me. I was really excited to see songs by the artist I like, but the kids didn't like any of those. (Except Cake and Bare Naked Ladies - the two good songs we all liked).Every time I buy a compilation album with different artists I regret it. THere may be a few songs I like, but also a lot I don't.I would recommend THey Might be Giants for people who are looking for songs kids and Adults will both like."
2,snooze fest,"I'm sad to say that Suede has hit rock bottom with ""New Morning.""There's just nothing here that moves me. No edge to the music or lyrics that I expect from this band that was so darn good in the early 90's and that desperately tried to carry the torch after Butler left. Brett Anderson's voice sounds pretty good. I just wish they had better songs to show it off. They had mixed success on Coming Up and Head Music but this just falls flat IMO.If you are planning to sample Suede for the first time after reading or hearing about them I would recommend the Bernard Butler era albums ""Suede"" and ""Dog Man Star"". The double album B-sides ""Sci Fi Lullabie"" is fantastic too and lets you taste great tracks full of promise even after Bernard Butler split."
3,Sad goodbye,"This album is not Suede at their worst (I keep that ""honor"" to Head Music, an album with three excellent songs, but plenty of filler). But it's not definitiveley Suede at their best, for sure.Since the band doesn't exist enymore, is a really sad goodbye to one of the best bands in british history. One album serves that pourpose: ""Dog Man Star"". How far is Another Morning"" to that album!If you think Suede is just the band that brought us 'Trash' or 'Beautiful Ones' this album won't dissapoint you (you might find 'Obsessions' and 'One hit to the body' good tunes).But if you know what Suede is about (that amazing glam feeling!!), well, 'Astrogirl' is a good effort. Something else? Yes, after all is a very listenable album if you forget that this band is the one that wrote ""The wild ones"", or even ""Saturday Night"" or ""The Chemestry Beetwen Us"". But, as Brett Anderson has said, he's lost his demon... And this mediocre album is the complete domonstration. A sad goodbye."
1,This Stinks,This is one of those compilations that appear to have songs done by original artists and are done instead by some third rate lounge band. I think the sale of these CD's should by illegal. I also think that Amazon should not carry this kind of forgery.
3,could have been better,i loved mark fidrych. the choice of words is not appropriate for younger ones at all and some adult subjects. would not recomend for a younger reader at all and will not reread myself.
5,Excellent,"This was the first time I purchased anything on Amazon and I will definitely try it again. Couldn't find this set of Western DVDs anywhere else for my husband who is a big western nut, but found it with no problem and Amazon and the price was right. Got them in no time and he's enjoying them as I write this!"
5,A favorite!,Was happy to find this. Enjoyed The Virginian on TV growing up and can now watch it when I want.
1,The stories are great but the digital keeps skipping and jumping to the end,The dvd's are hard to watch because they jump to the end and sometimes it freezes and u have to wait for it to unfreeze. I keep going back till I get to catch the end of episode.
2,Not new,I was very disappointed when I got the 1st Season of the Virginian which I ordered new and it wasn't. It wasn't a sealed package like the other ones I ordered so I knew it had been opened and used .I got it as a gift so I had to keep it and buy another one for the person I was giving it to. It cost a lot more money but I had no choice since i couldn't give a used one as a gift. I paid extra to make sure it was new but it wasn't.
4,Too bad ...,"Hello !I'm just a french western lover and I knew these movies since I watched TV, in my teens .I used to hope I (and other ""little frenchies"") could see (at last) all these great and complete ""Bonanza"", ""The Virginian"", ""Wagon trail"" and may be those we didn't see on French TV (""Gunsmoke"", ""Have gun, will travel ...). French subtitles would have been enough but we won't even get those English subtitles . Too bad we're still waiting ..."
3,Poor Quality on LCD or Plasma TV,"My husband had been waiting for decades (no joke!) for this show to come out, and I must say he is a little disappointed at the picture quality on our 46"" Samsung LCD TV. The DVD picture is perfect on a conventional screen, but on the LCD screen it is blotchy, faded in spots, uneven, full of artifacts and washed off at times. He says he would rate it a 5 out of 10. He has only watched the first disk, but if the rest of them are the same, the quality is only slightly better than standard definition copies off Encore Western Channel. So, if you have a large screen LCD or Plasma, you may be disappointed. He did play the DVD on two different players, a Bluray and a regular player, both upconverting. The picture is perfect DVD quality on conventional screens though."
2,Seems to be a fake copy,"Some of the DVDs are corrupted. It just feels like they are pirated DVDs. Some of the 10 DVDs work, some don't. Very sad. This was a gift to my mom for Christmas. She loves James Drury. Wish I knew how to get my money back so I can get her something that works."
2,Not a happy cowboy,"The first product contained a disc that skipped. Amazon replaced it quickly and easily. I received the new product in two days and a credit for mailing the faulty product back. I have never seen such a quick, easy and undisputed return. Unfortunately the new product has two discs that skip. I was not aware of the faulty discs since there are 10 discs in the product and it took a while to watch the Virginian episodes (each 90 minutes long). The time frame to return the product has expired. If I could return it, and ask for a refund, I would. However 8 discs are in perfect condition, but I paid for 10 not 8."
3,"Another great collection of songs, but beware...","This is yet another of those big ""collections"" of some really cool, heart-and-soul-of-Country party songs...done by a no-name cover band! These are NOT the original artists. I'll even grant that the ""Country Dance Kings"" do fairly decent covers, but if you're actually looking for Alan Jackson, Tracy Bird, Confederate Rail Road et al., then you'd best look elsewhere."
1,Don't bother,Pitiful--don't waste your money--you can get more information from an online encyclopedia entry.
2,Falling Apart after 4 Months,"I am using this as a primary back pocket wallet and it is not even close to filled but the bottom of the ""pouch"" is ripped and I will need to purchase a new wallet. I wouldn't buy this product"
2,Disapointing shook experience,"My wife and I purchased this ebook to read to our son on his first Fourth of July holiday. We read the positive reviews and we only partially agree. The story and images are great! But, as an ebook for the iPad, pages are displayed multiple times together, requiring you to zoom in on each page to read the text and appreciate the drawings. The ebook just lacks a professional quality in it's finishing. So, please don't take my rating as being against the authors work, but rather those who translated it to the computer.Go and buy yourself the hardcopy, you will appreciate it so much more."
1,do not waste your money or time!,"I cannot say enough horrible awful things about the Actiontec G-series modem.I am now on my 3rd replacement modem (same model)!!!!! And it's on the fritz already (I'm looking for a new model right now and thought I might save a few users from the frustration). If you want it to crap out from unreliable parts every few months, than this is the modem for you. If you want something reliable that doesn't quit working randomly [...]"
1,Unexpected,"Worked on first try but when machines rebooted next day, DHCP gave wrong IP addresses. Customer service had no idea about the problem. Also, the network became much slower (with default settings, no Firewall). Returned to store."
5,works great for me,I have had one for 2 years without a single problem. The wireless works throughout the house without a hitch.
4,Worked flawlessly,I haven't had any problems with my actiontec modem. I had no trouble installing it and it has worked perfectly. The agent in the office next to me also has one and has had no problems.The reach of the signal has been good and I've had two computers using it (wirelessly) most of the time.
1,Don't bother,What a piece of cr*p. It did not work. I thought I could get something cheap but wasted on this. I should have got the latest technology on router.
4,Works great after I had to reset it,"The item was not correctly advertized as a ""Verizon"" Gateway. Fortunately, Actiontec Technical support was able to help me reset it for use with Qwest. Worked great once it was reset."
1,Poor Product,I've gotten two units from Verizon. The first would not get more than 356k download when I was suppose to get 3800k. The second one I got worked for two weeks then went back to the same problem. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Especially if you have to pay $100 for it.
2,He did what he said he would,"He was very professional and did what he said he would do. Had a problem with the unit when I tried to use it, I called him back and there was no problem at all in returning it or getting my money back. Finally a man with Ethics and morals. ThanksI will recommend and would use him again.I did not have a chance to use the item,So the star rating is not accurateJames"
1,have to reboot every few hours,"I got this for Verizon DSL service - but since first day, it needs to be rebooted every few hours. Sometimes, IM or Skype will still work, but email and web browsing just hangs. Verizon tech support no help at all, and there's no firmware update - or so they told me. Read online that others have same exact issue. I wouldn't recommend until there is a fix to this need for reboot two or more times a day."
4,solved internet drop out problem,After a few months of intermitent issues with the internet dropping out though modem - I found out it was due to the power source. I changed outlet and it works fine. Never had any other problems with the unit.
5,very satified.,nothing wrong besides that SAME smudge on the disc... it doesnt affect the item at all though and i bought the used one so its expected. it again comes with the dvd menu and besides the disc the itemis like new.
2,Fleece winter cap,"The hat is too small for my fat head. Looks kind of silly when worn, and the quality of it is just OK. I wouldn't buy it again. If I lost it I wouldn't be as upset about it as I was about the hat I was trying to replace."
1,Mis-matched parts,I ordered 3 of these for my 50 inch mower. While all three had the same part number sticker one of them had a different lift angle. I paid shipping to get them here and paid shipping to send them back. Still did not get a full refund. I was out $27 for nothing. Ordered blades online from another supplier with no problem and cheaper. Will not order any Mowtown products again.
4,I liked the recipes but,"my girlfriend did not like the fact there was no visuals any of the recipes. I go by names and ingredients, she goes by pictures. ::shrug:: The recipes are great either way"
5,Awesome Customer Service,"The condoms I ordered arrived, but they had an expiration date only ten months out. The seller sent another batch at NO COST. The best customer service I've ever received."
2,"Could've been a better, shorter book","The story of the Candlestick tornado and the people who died as a result of it is sad and shocking, and compelled me to keep reading, but I often found myself skimming through parts of this book. Why? Because the author kept repeating the same information and ideas. The book would have been much more readable and would have had a stronger impact if the repetitive passages had been edited out.If you have a strong interest in learning more about the sad events and loss of life at Candlestick, you may want to read this book. Be prepared, however, to wade through a lot of excess prose."
4,A World Turned Over,Reading it brought back memories of that day and of the world as it was in the '60's. The writer's style of communicating the facts and stories made for an interesting account.
2,Robert,I agree with the reviewer who thinks this book is overdone. If Hemingway wanted to show off her writing ability then why didn't she just write The Great American Novel instead? I found myself skimming through all her flowery prose to get just the facts of the story. I'm not saying I don't enjoy literature. I do. But I don't expect or want to find a book full of lyrical prose when I pick up what is essentially a historical account of a tornado that hit a strip mall. It's like sending coal miners to work wearing Gucci suits if you ask me.
2,More childhood memoir than disaster book,"This book seems out of place in the ""disaster book"" genre. The author seems more concerned with reliving her childhood. Not a very good read."
1,Looking for more,"I bought this book looking for technical training insight. I have already completed two triathlons and this book was written for someone with less experience. With the exception of a few tips, the book is written for someone who has no knowledge of triathlon."
1,Invaluable,"Unlike what most readers state on this page, I found this book to have little information. However it is a nice book that makes you enthusiastic about the sport, but there is no content that will make me a better thriatlete. There is no information about the correct training techniques and the main focus is on the non-Ironman distances. The writer likes to use these little questions between brackets, which are at first funny, but later quite irritating."
2,skimpy on details,"I really can't recommend this book. I'm training for my first triathlon so consider myself a newbie -- but this book did ~not~ gve me the info I need. Advice like ""wear a helmet"", ""drink lots of fluids""... duh!!! - my 8 year old son knows that. The author recommends to get help elsewhere on swimming and cycling techniques because the details are beyond the scope of the book. I don't need a book for this kind of advice! I read another older book (can't remember the name at the moment) which gave good solid advice -- even for a newbie like myself. The mechanics of the freestyle stroke ~can~ be explained in simple terms by someone who understands and knows how to write. In short: too much filler, not enough meat. That said, it was not a total waste -- I was able to glean some facts obliquely referenced in the text."
4,Great introduction to Triathlon,"This was the first book on Triathlon racing and training that I bought - several years ago. Its a well-written introduction to the sport and to training. An easy read, it covers all the basics - swim technique, biking mileage and the ever popular run.I think any beginner should start with this book for the sections on nutrition, staying healthy and race preparation. Some of the best advice you can get - aside from fellow triathletes - is in this book about race day prep, things to know and do, etc."
2,Great show - poor transfer,"This was an excellent television show. That is a fact. The first time I ordered this dvd set disc three was cracked. The second time I tired to watch (replaced collection) disc four stalled while playing {on several players}. Haven't checked the first three discs yet, but this looks like strike two. Also Suzanne Sommers received top star billing and was only in one episode. I grew up watching this show on prime time and was disappointed with the quality of the dvd. The special features are great too!"
5,"""Lotsa Luck"" a winner!",Dom DeLuise showed his star quality in this early TV series that deserved to continue for many seasons. It was ahead of its time. I recommend this series to anybody who enjoys a laugh and great entertainment.
2,Love Dom.....BUT.......,"Dom DeLuise cracks me up. This show did not. Bad writing. Somewhat depressing. But I do admire these fine actors really trying their best to make it funny. For them, 5 stars."
5,Super Scorpions!,"Just as I hoped it would be -- live shots as well as artistically created videos. My ONLY disappointment was that the song ""Holiday"" is only the short version. The second part of the song is fantastic and I was hoping it would be included. DVD shows a wide variety of songs from many different albums and you can choose each song individually, or you can select ""play all"". Klaus' voice is right-on throughout the entire series and each musician's talents are featured in detail. As a total ""Rudolf devotee"", it's fantastic because you can hear every lick perfectly. A definite MUST for Scorpions fans!"
3,"Right band,wrong show","A great live band captured in an average show. still rocks, and much better than the ""Moment of Glory"" DVD, but the ""World Wide Live"" concert released on VHS is much better"
2,A Good Show But!!!!!!!!!!,Je Ne Parle Pas Beaucoup Anglais Alors Excuser Mes Fautes S.V.P . The Image Of The Show Is Good But The Sound Is Bad Because The Voice Of Singer Up And Down Frequently And The 2.0 Surround It's Pitiful
3,Okay but not that great of performance on live,"The live show is okay but I've seen the vhs World wide live and the performance live on stage is better, by the way kon world wide live Klaus swings the microphone on Dynamite higher than on A crazy savage world. They didn't even sing the Wind of change or still loving you on the disc, they just put some songs from crazy world live on to the dvd, the best thing on that dvd was the music videos, it's crystal clear! on the rate i would give about 3 stars."
2,The manufacturer's could have corrected past mistakes,"When the live portion of this DVD was FIRST released on VHS I was disappointed with it, due to the horrible mix. Jabs' guitar is so low it's barely audible (and he's the main soloist, for those who don't know tha band) and Meine's vocals could also do to be higher.I was hoping this DVD would have corrected this shortcoming, since it spoils my enjoyment considerably. Indeed, it's made it difficult to play more than once or twice. However, this DVD seems a straight copy of the VHS. Maybe the original master no longer exists: if it did they could have made this into the full gig, maybe, or redressed the mix.In a word, frustrating."
3,"Cool content, but low quality","First, the live part. The image quality is ok, the sound quality is not too good, but it works. The problem, however, is that the sound is badly synced with the image, so it almost looks like those German dubbed movies. The obvious reason for this is that it actually is dubbed, which is easily seen when Rudolf Schenkers guitar changes color in the middle of the songs. When it comes to the videos, the newer ones are ok, the older ones are blurry and often contains scan lines. Some are almost as low quality as the 50mb divx movies flying arond on kazaa and similar services.Since I'm a big fan of the Scorpions, I would still have bought this DVD if I knew what I know today. But I have to say that the mastering of this dvd is so bad that it would barely keep a movie editing student from failing the course."
5,Muy BUeno,Me encanta la musica y sobre todo colecciono videos todos los titulos que pueda conseguir y esta compra es uno de ellos
4,How much of a live concert is this?,"Great to see some of the footage from Scorps thru these years but I've only seen it mentioned in one other review so I'll mention it again:The big downside to the live show presented here is the fact aside from sloppy/out of synch editing, there are many vocals and guitar parts that have been rather sloppily overdubbed. This 'fabricated' feel really kinda makes it a sweet and sour experience to watch. I wonder why it was so heavily dubbed, the Scorpions were playing great thru this time period.Four stars for the overall package which also features videos and interviews, but if you're mainly interested in the live show try to pick it up on the cheap.I wish I could find some good quality Footage/Audio of a Savage Amusement concert featuring a live performance of Don't Stop at The Top, Walking On The Edge or Media Overkill...."
2,"Expensive, fun once or twice",The game is expensive! I thought it would be so much more than it is. You stack blocks in a given amount of time and if you don't get the block stacked the base shakes and the blocks fall. My grandson liked it a few times but aoon thought it was more fun to just see how high he could stack and watch them fall. It was okay for about 15 minutes and but quickly became tired of it.
3,my kids scared of the voice,"We received this game as a gift for my 5 and 7 year olds. The 5 year old was very frustrated because her towers kept getting knocked down. Together they were determined to win. Unfortunately, when they did, the voice laughed in a sinister manner and shook their tower down anyway. The 5 year old was scared, the 7 year old angry and they didn't want to play it again."
5,Phenomenal Book,A must have for all looking for the basic foundation of a freedom education.It breaks down a lot of historical information in several different categories allowing for quick and easy reference and historical perspective.
2,A Childs' Dictionary,"I would suggest that the prospective buyer check ""Look inside this book"" before you add it to your cart. If you already know who Abraham and Isaac, Adam and Eve, and Angels are, there might not be too much here for you."
1,the very first paragraph of the very first entry is wrong,"The Jewish Bible and the Christian Bible are not the same book. Referring to the Jewish Bible as having/being the ""Old Testament"" is not only inaccurate, it is extremely disrespectful. That such a glaring error appears in a third edition should be an embarassment.I shudder to think what errors lurk on less well known topics."
3,The good is the enemy of the great,"With a bit of effort, this book could've been great. But instead it is mediocre.The problems:1) It doesn't have an entry for every U.S. president. This should be basic knowledge for all Americans. There are only 44 of them, only 10 more than NFL teams, and fewer than the 50 states (which again, every American should know by heart).2) No specific dates. People and events are dated quite generally: a twentieth century author, a sixteenth century painter, etc. Giving precise dates would have taken up less space and provided more exact information3) It's Eurocentric and heavy on WWII. Sure, a lot of things happened in Europe and during WWII, but a lot of things happened elsewhere, too.4) No sections on sports or entertainment. While these may not be particularly scholarly topics, they are a huge part of our culture."
3,Daughters of the Grail,"Daughters of the Grail takes place in early 1200's France. The Catholics are mercilessly persecuting the Cathars, who have taken refuge in mountain fortresses and a few sympathetic towns. Traveling with the Cathars is Bridget, a mysterious woman with special powers for healing and the sight. She needs to give birth to a daughter to continue her unbroken lineage from Mary Magdalene. This makes her a special target of the Catholics who would like to see her destroyed. Times won't be any easier for her daughter.I had high expectations for this book that weren't met. I found the plot to be slow and I wasn't attached to any of the characters. I have two other novels of Elizabeth Chadwicks sitting on my ""to be read"" shelf, and I hope that they will be more entertaining than Daughters of the Grail was."
1,Yet another dead after 2 years,"I purchased this drive for my Windows system in July 2005. It worked fine as a backup drive until exactly 2 years later, when, similar to the experiences of other reviewers, one night it started making loud clicking noises as though trying to calibrate itself, and after that it could never mount again, and in fact attempts to attach it caused other data transfers to hang until after I unplugged it from the USB port. Seagate's online diagnostic was actually helpful in identifying several dozen bad sectors, and its conclusion was that I should back up any data on the drive because it was hosed. This was impossible however (lucky there was only backup data on the drive), so I am now the owner of a very sturdily constructed 160GB doorstop."
4,Still a decent piece of hardware,"I bought this device back in Fall '03 for school and have been using it ever since. Of course, back then I only had a 30gb HD on my laptop and my current laptop has 160gb, but it's still great as a back up for all of my mp3's and movies. 4 years of use definitely isn't bad, although I did pay a whopping $270 for it when it first came out."
2,Don't rely on it to help you move your data from PC to Mac!,"I bought this hard drive to help me move my data from my PC running Windows ME that I'm getting rid of, to a new Mac Mini that's on the way. (The PC's CD-ROM burner is busted, so I can't use it for backup.)Turns out I can't do that with this product unless I also buy a $79.99 utility called MacOpener (not a Seagate product).Seagate's customer support had to do research for 10 minutes before they figured this out. They told me that my situation was ""very unique."" Baloney. I'm sure I'm not the only person out there who is switching from a PC to a Mac and has pre-existing data on their external hard drive. They were not very sympathetic to my situation and got defensive when I suggested they do a better job of conveying this shortcoming of the product on their packaging.Can't wait to go out and buy a $79.99 software product to run once on a Windows machine I'm about to throw away. Thanks, Seagate."
3,"Excellent drive quality, poor support for macs","I would agree with most reviewers that seagate produces quality external drives. When running, my drive operated seamlessly. However, as a macintosh owner, I am disappointed with Seagate's technical support for mac users. There is very little information that they provide in the booklet, and the website technical support is also very limited and asks you to refer to your Apple support documents for assistance. If there was more specific information on reformatting the drive for Mac use, I would have avoided some of the problems that I ran into with this drive. Sure I could go through the trouble of looking for information through the Apple website, but Seagate should still shoulder the responsibility to inform Mac users about running their drives with Macs."
1,"Mine failed after two years, beware of known SEAGATE drive reliability problems!!!","I bought this 160GB external hard drive an amazon in Dec, 2003 (based on the good reviews it received back then) and it lasted exactly for two years! A day before Christmas 2005 the drive would out of the blue issue loud clicking sounds in the middle of the night and by the next morning (when I discovered it), all of its partitions had become inaccessible and the drive had died. With the warranty only lasting one year (kind of tells you how much a company stands behind their products) I'm basically left with an expensive lemon. With so many reviewers on here now experiencing similar things in terms of reliability with Seagate's products I am really wondering if this industry should have more federal oversight that better protects consumers from such failures."
2,"Worked fine, but failed after 16 months","I bought this a little over a year ago, and it just failed. While it was working, it worked fine. But one year seems a short warranty."
1,REPUTATION DOES NOT HOLD UP,"I purchased a Seagate HDs after a long search for a quality product. I did a lot of research only to find that many other HDs had crashed after a week. I was told that Seagate should have a quality product since their HDs have been used in PCs for years -- the reason I purchased this product.The purpose of this HD was as my backup system. After just under a month, the HD crashed. I was assured by one Seagate rep not to worry about my data loss because they could recover it -- of course I found out later FOR A STEEP FEE.This product sucks just as much as the rest of the HDs that crash. I had years of digital pictures I transferred onto this HD that are now lost - memories that cannot be recovered!Seagate was pretty useless to offer anything other than an exchange of a new harddrive.MY RECOMMENDATION: INVEST IN A CD OR DVD BURNER TO SAVE YOUR DATA"
1,Backup Software Ruins Good Seagate Drive,"Installed the hardrive with no difficulty and it appears to function quietly and efficiently BUT on my Win XP unit with USB 2 interface it was useless as a backup drive when used with the provided CMS BounceBack Express Software.I followed the cryptic installation instructions, read the manual and searched web resources but still got ""Tryfailure"" message with every backup attempt.Deleting and disabling more and more software and hardware did not help.In despiration I downloaded Dantz Retrospect which is supplied withn the Maxtor units and I was immediately backing up my hard drive - very speedily but without push button functionality.For now I would I advise users to purchase the Maxtor Drive with the Dantz Software.I'll keep you updated on any feedback from Seagate and CMS."
1,Very dissapointed....,Maybe it's a fluke but a received 2 defective drives. The first one didn't power up at all and the second one worked well for a few days then froze up. I am using this with a Mac w/OSX. customer support is non exisitent and this drive model isn't even on the website. No more for me!
1,Mac User Drive Failure,I bought this drive about a year ago and it worked fine until this morning.Simply doesn't see any of the data that I've stored on it. The drive makes what may be a new noise but it's hard to tell.Very surprising considering the unit has barely been touched or moved over its lifetime. I've been only using it for infrequent backups.The only thing I can think to do is avoid these types of drives in the future.
3,Sufficient,"It's big, it's loud, and it has lasted for six years now in my care. Chances are, if you're able to find one of these secondhand, you won't regret the purchase. They're not ideal drives due to their size and noisiness, but you can connect them via either USB2 or FireWire, making them an excellent choice for older Macs like the original Mac Mini."
5,Easy Install!,"The installation of this drive was by far the easiest thing I have done on a computer for a long time! I am using it to store graphics files, and I can work on them in Photoshop as if they are on the main drive: no loss of speed reading or writing. The included ""Bounce-Back"" backup software wasn't as user friendly, so I uninstalled it and am just using the drive for storage, which is what I wanted it for anyway. Highly recommended."
4,Great Hardware - Not so good Software,"The Hardware is great - very quiet and love that they included both USB and Firewire cables and a real on/off switch. 5 minutes from unpacking to trying it out.I ended up not using the included backup software because it is a crippled version - you have to pay $$ for all the features, especially the Directory Syncing I wanted. I would have rated 5 stars if this software was actually worth using. (I ended up using the free software everybody else talks about here)I did use the other included software tool to re-format the drive to the NTFS for my WinXP system - which it did easy enough, but this might be overlooked by less techy users.So far so good."
1,wow! it only lasted three days.,"I thought this bell was great - cool design, great colors, not too loud, perfect stocking stuffer. However, my five year old tipped her bike on the ground one time (she is no daredevil, believe me) and the bell stopped working. One of the plastic gears inside cracked right off and is now floating inside. She can still make a faint ring from time to time until the broken gear pieces jam the other two gears. Definitely disappointing for the price."
1,Not durable and difficult for small child to operate while riding,"After one season, one of the plastic gears inside the bell broke so it does not turn anymore (and therefore does not ring). Also, to ring the bell (when it was in working order), you have to spin the outside ring of the bell, which takes more manual dexterity than just a simple flick of the thumb (like with the old-fashioned bells). I will not be replacing the broken one with another of these -- I'll be ordering an old-fashioned, all-metal model."
5,Very user friendly,"This is a great bike bell! It is very easy to use and makes a fairly loud, but not irritating sound. I like it because it is easy for my kids to use--they can just barely touch the bell while riding and it rings. Super easy to install and adjustable for different size handlebars."
5,Great Bell for Mountain Biking,"I purchased this bell for myself and my riding buddies followed my lead. The bell works great on the trails. It is amazingly easy to ring, but doesn't ring when you don't want it to when you're bombing down the trail. All of us have been surprised how effective it is with hikers being able to hear us.We have found the bell makes for a better ride (hikers know we are coming and will move to the side) and we all feel like we are better trail users.Most impressive is that hikers with noise canceling headphones have been able to hear me.Lastly, it has already survived a couple of wrecks and is still ringing away.Thank you Mirrycle for a great product!Check out the link below for another review.http://mtbikeaz.com/2012/01/02/casa-grand-mountain-revisited/"
3,Durability is the problem,Pro's:The sound volume can be easily modulated by spinning it slowly to have it ring softly when you want or spinning it harder to make it louder when needed.Con's:Durability is the issue with this thing. They seem to last about a year before something inside breaks.
2,Cute but not very functional,"So maybe I should have known this bell is for kids' bikes, but it doesn't say that anywhere in the description. I love the orange and got it to go on my bright orange and red bicycle. Unfortunately it didn't fit so I had to tie it onto my handlebars. Also, it rattles and jingles so much I rarely get to use it because people can hear me coming a block away. Probably great for a little kid who doesn't have to worry about navigating traffic but not recommended for grown-ups."
1,Confusing and Reducing,I never realized that a study of the living God could be turned into such confusing charts and stagnant layouts like this. It makes studying God seem like we are studying a car engine or DVD player.
3,Trey's Masterpiece,"I really, really like Xaphan, and I now like Le Mani DeStre Recise DeGli Ultimi Uomini. The First and Second Grand Constitution and Bylaws LPs and Book M span the musical universe, and Trey has gained himself a seat in my upper stratosphere of musicians with all of this work. Book of Horizons is the epic album. Book of Horizons stands above all that Trey has done thus far. Book T: Exodus, The Exile and Welcome to the Theatron Animatronique are the best songs of the bunch for those looking to get a taste, but this is not a singles LP. To fully appreciate what Trey has done here, you will have to listen to this LP from beginning to end. It's breath taking."
5,Trey blows it up again!!!!,Another solid step for The Secret Chiefs 3. Noone in modern music can compete with Trey's versatile gift for music. His knowledege and love for the mutiple styles that grace S.C. andBungle albums is unmatched. On top of that he is an INCREDIBLE engineer. His tatse for mixing and effects is top notch...and takes TONS of chances. Humble is another word that comes to mind as this is the Secrect Chiefs(even though it's obvious that this is his brain child)not TREY SPRUANCE. Very welcome this day and age.Trey is up there and many times surpasses the composers that have influenced him....especially with this CD.Wonder if David Lynch or Tim Burton will find this guy???
4,Better grip....,Keeps control's clean and provides extra grip. Probably has saved me several times from dropping and breaking things. A must buy for all Wii owners.
1,Don't waste the postage.,Thought these would be a great addition for the wii but they were a waste. Very difficult to get on. We use rechargeable batteries in our wii controllers and this doesn't work well with those. and they have to be removed so the controller can fit back in the charger.
3,It's not all about the looks,"Looks great. Feels good. But, wait until you need to change the batteries. Good luck removing the cover so taht you can remove the back to insert the new batteries."
1,2 Tone junk,I bought this item and tried to put it on it was like trying to put a small shirt on a very large man it rip right away.
1,Blank,"The video store i rent from had the same problem as the other guy, tho each of the three copies they got were completely blank. Too bad cause its a good series, someone please post a review that says your copy works if any actually exist"
1,3 tries and still not working...,"I really enjoy the series but for whatever reason this volume didnt play at all in my computer or DVD player. I went through 3 different copies of the same volume and all of them did the same thing. I dont know much about the technical stuff of publishing on DVDs but it might be possible that all dvds that where distributed where defective. The first one I had I returned to get a new one through amazon, the thrid I bought in a best buy and the same problem occured. So I'm kinda stuck."
4,Easy to be understood. Must-read for Logic!,"Logic is a hard topic, before one read this book. I read the Chinese translation several years ago and find it very precise and concise. Plus suitable examples and good elaboration, nobody can explain logic better with the same amount of words than the author of this book."
2,Defective...,"When I purchased this a week ago, I received a defective copy. The first 3 episodes play fine, but the last 3 keep freezing up while you play them."
5,A masterpiece,"This music has left me speechless since I first heard it. A vessel to sail your inner ocean. A window to your deepest feelings. Joy, sadness, nostalgia, longing, solitude, rain, letting go, dancing to your own tune...You name it. You will find it here. Spool is a must have, one of the most brilliant records of the past century. Please Jhno, make some more noise."
1,This stuff is awful,"I put this on my face and it felt like I was using acid. My face turned bright red and was burning. I thought maybe it was because it was the first time using it. I put it on again that evening and it was worse. The burning was terrible. I washed my face three times to get the stuff off. But, the burning would not stop. So, I had to put a soothing moisturizer on and that did help. My face was red all weekend and it looked like I sat in the sun and got a horrible sunburn. Needless to say, I returned this product to the store. I bought it for wrinkles and couldn't tell you if it works for that, but I can tell you if you want to lose your skin, it works. Maybe my skin is very sensitive, but I will never put this stuff near my skin again. This was recommended by the rep, and although she was a very nice lady, this was not for my skin."
5,Still using it after all these years.,I have used StriVectin for at least 6 years and I believe that it really works. Obviously I wouldn't continue to use if it didn't.
5,strivectin,I am skeptical of most skin care products that make big claims. However this product has made a difference that even myfacialist noticed. I am sold!
3,Can't really see the difference,"I purchased StriVectin-SD twin pack from Costco few months ago and I am about to finish the last one. I applied twice a day. I am 48 years old and I have some fines lines under my eyes, however I don't expect the ""same or even close than botox"" result. So far I don't feel like my skin is the same when I was 45."
1,Don't waste your money.,I have white stretch marks on my tummy but they are not very prominent. I can still wear a 2 piece bikini but I do wish I can diminish them. I bought this Strivectin and paid almost $60 for it. I used it twice per day for over a month and did not notice any change at all. Don't waste your money.
1,useless!,This is a big sham...they sold it to me saying it would erase the fine lines off my forehead...No effect at all....
1,Crap!,"I thought this might work, but was mistaken!!!! I did just as it said and I have no difference in the stretch marks on my thighs. Save your time and money and don't buy this stuff!!!! It would have 0 stars but Amazon doesn't allow that :>"
1,disappointed,It didn't work like It said It would.don't waist your money on this product.. go buy a store brand cream .It made my face breakout . I'm never buying this product again (
1,Stangely Odd or Caveat emptor,I find it strangely odd that everyone who gave this product a fantastic review:1. Has only ever reviewed one product on Amazon2. All seem to have been posted on the 24th.Caveat emptor.
1,not the real thing ?,"I have been buying this from various places at about $130 and was happy to find it for about half price. Wrong. I have been using this product for several years and was sadly disappointed with what I received. While I absolutely love the real Strivectin, what I received had a tube that looked the same, had all the same verbiage, but the contents were runny, had an ""odd"" smell, and were not in the box that normally comes with it.Having said that, I still decided to try using it for a while and found it was really, really greasy.....almost like someone had altered the contents by adding mineral oil. Strivectin contains an analgesic to give a slight tingle on the skin. This also gives it a distinct smell. The product I received runs out of the tube when inverted. Normally Strivectin must be squeezed from the tube. I mention all this for new users who may not know the difference.I will stick to getting this from my retail supplier!!"
3,Alright for eyes and skin discoloration,I bought this originally for stretch marks and of course it did not work. But I still had it when I got dark circles under my eyes. It really did improve the color and I still use it for discolorations. I now use it for skin discolorations because I am African American and I sometimes hyper pigment. I am sure that there is something much cheaper for what it does. I certainly wouldn't recommend it because I can use Oil of Olay or some over the counter product that would do the same thing. If it was less expensive then it would be a good buy.
1,Save your money,This product is not what it claims to be..I have been using it for 9 weeks and I don't see any improvement whatsoever.... makes me wish I had saved the $140 and bought myself some new golf clubs. It doesn't even do well for a wrinkle creme...I've seen better cremes at Walmart.... plus it has this peppermint smell that makes me think of my wife's foot lotion.
1,Check this out,I purchased this product only to come home and find out that on EWG's skin deep cosmetic database it has a very bad rating and it's toxic
5,Pleased with the results!,"I have used this product twice a day for the past three years and believe it works for me. It has definitely decreased the fine lines and wrinkles in my face and I can see and feel smoother skin. It's not an overnight success but if you use it as directed, I believe it does what it is suppose to do. I have read other reviews where they don't think it works for them but I personally think it does a good job. I like the scent as well. It's not too strong for me. I recommend this product!"
2,"Moisturizing, but that is about it.","I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months. While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture. For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better."
1,Not a good choice for sensitive and dry skin,"I should have read this before trying StreVectin. I used its intensive repair and its eye cream at night. The next morning, I used both again. And my face felt like exposing in a desert for the whole day. As I checked my face in the mirror, it was abnormally red. My face felt itchy too. I bought the eye cream to moisturize my eye skin, but found for the first time in my life fine lines under my eyes after using it! Now I DO have an eye skin problem!My case might be an exception since I have sensitive skin. Warnings to those who have thin and sensitive skin!"
3,expired,i was trilled at the purchase price for this product. I have used this product before but was disappointed because. The cream i bought from Amazon was made in 2008 and it did not have that warm feeling when applied according to the label.
1,"Less than one star, actually... :(","I found this product did absolutely NOTHING for me...granted I don't have huge wrinkles, but the few I do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! I wish I had asked around from friends, cause if I had I would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. I'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? Is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? AND is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that REALLY works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money...)"
1,Not Quite Right...,The color and smell of this product was off from what I've purchased at Sephora in the past. Perhaps an expired product. I don't recommend purchasing here.
1,Use this if you want to look older,"I used this product for one month. I thought if I kept using it that maybe it would eventually work. It made my skin old looking. I stopped using Strivectin. Now I am using a cheap creme and my face is back to normal.LauraSeattle, Washington"
1,Not Good For Stretch Marks,The only people who left good reviews didn't use it on their marks. That's because it doesn't work on them! Please save your cash for something that will work. I hope I find one that actually does work.
3,Nice moisturiser but not better than botox,"I received a bottle as a gift and I've been using it for a couple of months now. I really like the way it moisturizes my face. I use a small amount because a little goes a long way. I actually like the peppermint scent. It's a little strong but I like it. I have normal skin, not too dry or oily, and this product makes my skin very soft. I haven't noticed any decrease in the fine wrinkles in my face. From my experience with the product, the claim that this cream is better than botox is false. As a moisturizer this product is excellent, but I think it's a little overpriced for what it really does."
4,Never thought I would see conspiracy theories over a cream but...,"I recieved this product as a gift for Christmas. I have two kids and I am 25 years old. I recently lost all of my baby weight (30 lbs) and I was lamenting over my stretch marks on my stomach and sides. The worst marks are on the front of my stomach. I began using the cream this christmas eve and have used it three times daily since. I have noticed a difference in the area where the marks were the worst. The not so bad marks have not faded much but the depth and color of the deepest stretch marks have almost evened out with the the rest of them. My husband and mother also noticed the difference. I also noticed the peppermint smell but it doesn't bother me at all. I will continue to use it and see what happens.I would never expect it to completely get rid of my stretch marks, however. That would just be ridiculous."
2,StriVectin-SD,"I usually buy the new-packaging product however this item arrived with my last order. Whilst very moisturizing (which I can achieve for a lot less money) the efficacy of this product is greatly diminished from previous purchases. I can only imagine that an additional question needs to be asked when considering ordering this-Is this the original 'brownish' colored cream or the newly 'white' created product. Very disappointed in this product compared to previous purchases, an expensive mistake thrown into the garbage."
2,nothing special,"As many other people I purchased this product expecting good results regarding firming and erasing wrinkles and I didn't see them at all.Plus the fact that as somebody else said it smells horrible.My personal recomendations with great results and for less money:Redermic by La Roche Posay: is great to fill wrinkles,you just need to put a small ammount in the targeted area and you'll see!And as a firming and moisturising cream:Regenerist by Olay,smells great and is not sticky or greasy at all.If you want to add a glowing look that erase sun or age spots,you'll be very pleased with Lumedia (but apply it before anything else)."
3,Stay away from perfumania,"I ordered StriVectin from Perfumania thinking I was getting a 6 oz. tube, which is what I had selected and instead got a 5 ml tube for more money than I could have purchased a 6 oz. tube through Amazon from another company. This is a complete rip off and they will not make good for it. Stay away from ordering anything from Perfumania!!!"
1,Doesn't work...,"It's very expensive and didn't dimish my stretch marks, old or new. I followed the directions as advised. Don't waste your money."
2,Yet another useless product,"Don't believe the hype around this product. Unless I happen to be one of the 7% who experience no results as indicated in the literature, this stuff did nothing for me...and I used it as directed. Revitol, Celrase, Nivea Q10...none of these cellulite/stretch mark creams work. The only products that have helped me are X-tend Life products from New Zealand. They take care of it all. I do not work for X-tend Life; I'm just trying to help other frustrated customers find a true remedy."
2,i think Botox IS better,"I've been using it 2 times a day for 4 months. Unfortunately, i did not get the result it promised, even though i am 30 yo and just started to get wrinkles. I think (hope) StriVectin gave some good to my skin overall, since it is full of great ingredients. However, i cannot really see it.The bottom line is it was too expensive for me (even though i found it for $95) for the result i got.I plan to go with Shiseido next time. My friend got rid of wrinkles with it."
1,I ruined my face,"I have been using StriVectin-SD for 10 years. I just loved it. But now I'm totally disappointed. I got new one Strivectin -SD and creme for neck from my daughter like birthday present. Because I used it for years I did not made the test. I put creme on my face and about 1 1/2 hour nothing happened and I was happy.After that my face gone red, but not just red, purple, hot. They say that small warm can occur and it disappear after 1 - 2 hour. It's already four days and my face still purple, I look like I gone thru fire. I don't know what to do. I totally ruined my face. I'm afraid that it's never going to be like before."
1,Dont Buy this online,This is not the real stuff. It is brown and looks old. It smells really funny too. I recommend buying it at the store where it is fresh.
1,I still haven't received this!!,I still haven't received this product. Hopefully it will arrive any day but I have waited one month.
4,waiting...,"this was the best price i found. however can't say anything about product: none of the sources(but the product instructions) indicated that pregnant and nursing shouldn't use it, so i have another year and a half to wait before i can try."
5,Very Good,"Product already used before with affordable price by amazon offer. Fast delivery and safely received without any breakage.For the cosmetic concerns, this is the best in these kinds."
2,StriVectin-SD,"Have been using this product for years and cannot do without it. However, I just opened the package I received from you and it must be old or something. When getting it out of tube it seem to seperate and I can't account for it unless it is old. I do notice they have changed packaging and wonder if that is not the case with this. Have never had this happen before."
2,Strivectin,"As soon as I opened the tube and began to place some of the cream on my hand/fingers, it was much more watery than any I had used in the past. I am too lazy to return it to you so I am using it every night as always but with regret that I ordered it through the internet instead ofo the department store.Sorry for the remarks but the truth hurts sometimes.Barb Harris/barbezwriter@aol.com"
1,"Careful, may cause dermatitis","I purchased this product and used it only on my face for 7 days. I developed terrible dermatitis. I discontinued the product immediately and am healing now. I am not usually prone to dermatitis caused by lotions or skin preparations and was very surprised. The cream smells very much like a prescription ointment I have once used for something unrelated, however I saw none of those ingredients listed."
1,Not happy with product!!,"I purchased StriVectin-SD Intensive Concentrate for Stretch Marks in January. I decided to give the product a chance, being that I have heard rave reviews about it. After the first week of using StriVectin, my strech marks were smoother and so was the surrounding skin. I continued to follow instructions carefully, I even exfoliated three times a week, thinking this would also help the process. By the end of the month I noticed no change at all! I just had smooth strech marks, wtf? I decided after the sixth week if nothing happed, I would return the product. Just as I thought, after six weeks of using this product, I was disappointed to see that nothing changed. Don't waste your money, this is clearly for fresh stretch marks and companies should make it a point to say that."
3,it works,"After my babay was born I had some strechmarks in my thights, they where still a bit red when I started using the cream. My friends told me it was good and it had better results if I used it a soon as I could when de marks where still a bit red.It really worked, they didnt desapeared completely but vanishes alot.I believe the product is good, althoug is a bit expensive I think there could be otrher similar productos in the market that may have the same beneffits but not so expensive.When I was breastffedding I could not used it in my breasts."
3,Didn't see any results...smell is horrible,"I personally did not experience any noticeable results after 30 days. Also, the smell is just horrible. The company claims that it is peppermint, but to me it smells like that plus rancid oil. Not pleasant at all. It would have been bearable if it had worked at all!!But the good news is that I contacted the seller from whom I purchased the cream through Amazon.com and they initiated an immediate refund.That is commendable."
2,"Moisturizing, but that is about it.","I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months. While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture. For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better.As for ""better than Botox"" - buyer beware when you hear that line!"
2,Just another moisturizer,"I had heard so many wonderful things about this product and how it helped the skin contour, removed fine lines, etc.I have used it three times a day for a month with NO CHANGE AT ALL. However, it is a nice EXPENSIVE moisturizer."
3,Not sure yet,"I've only been using this for a month, and I can't see much of a difference in the diminishing of facial wrinkles, but I like the way it feels and I like the smell, so I will probably keep using it, at least until the tube is gone."
4,I think I see results,"The lines in my forehead are definitely softer. The lines around my lips and mouth and in between my eyes also seem to be a tiny bit better, but I am not sure, quite honestly, if that is just hopeful wishing, or true. I use this product faithfully and figure if I keep at it for several months I'll be able to determine better. However, Amazon has asked me to rate this, so I am. It's amusing to me that the lines in my forehead are definitely softer when those were the lines that were first to appear back in my early 30's...you'd think they'd been there the longest so they'd be most difficult to soften. My more recent (or at least less noticible until the last couple of years) lines seem to be more stubborn.I think I've read that perisistence will show results, so I will update this review as I see results."
3,"decent results, but takes discipline to use","If you use it like instructed, the results are pretty good. It does take discipline to make yourself apply it 3 times a day though!!"
2,StriVectin SD Intesive Repair review,"I have been using this product exactly as directed since I received it in early January and I can say honestly I see no difference. The only plus is it starts out as a nice moisturizer, but later seems to get greasy. I will not buy this again and feel very cheated by this company and their promises."
1,Doesn't seem to be the real deal.,I have been using strivectin for over a year now and this product looks and smells nothing like what I've been using. I've very disappoint that amazon would allow fake products to be sold on their site. Very disappointing and now I'm stuck with crap.The packaging and safety seal are not the same as usual and neither is the color of the lotion.
2,the size???,"the size sucked, the product did not show me any improvement annd i HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER THREE WEEKS NOW."
1,Another Cream That Belongs in Trash,I used 2 tubes of this for months and just like trilastin sr ..IT'S GARBAGE!It does moisturize but so do a million other creams..it's meant for stretch marks but doesn't do nothing for them. It didn't work on my 3 month old stretch marks from pregnancy and it didn't work on my 10 year old stretch marks either. Regret spending $300 on this crap!
5,I really like it!!!!,"I feel my skin like a lettuce, fresh and healty, this cream is a spa for my face and countour of my eyes, I use it all the weekend without make up so I can enjoy the feeling of elasticity."
4,it seems to be working,"I have only used this product for about three weeks, but it seems to be better than any other product that I have used"
2,eh.,we knew there would be no good answer for old stretch marks. used this religiously for about a month and a week and saw no improvement at all. so i gave up. it was worth a shot though. i am glad other have had success.
1,Does not work,Another disappointing anti aging product. Save your money and try some less expensive products first and research any expensive products on the internet first.
2,Not impressed!!!,"I used this on some older stretch marks that I had and it did nothing for them. It is a great moisturizer, but way too expensive to use for that. I ended up buying 100% unrefined shea butter and noticed a significant improvement in my older stretch marks and it moisturizes my skin all day from just one application. Makes a great all over body moisturizer and you can even use it in your hair. The unrefined shea butter is way cheaper and way more effective. I would suggest buying the unrefined shea butter instead."
5,Works fantastic!,"My wife has had three children in 5 years. Needless to say, she had* horrible stretch marks on her rear end and thighs. We tried several products (Mederma, BioOil, Neutragena) with little success. 3 Weeks after using this product ALONE twice a day, there is a very noticeable difference in their appearance. The marks on her thighs are GONE. I can still feel where they were in a few places because I know where to look. However, they are not visible in any way under any light. The ones she has on her rear end are fading and smoothing. I would expect those to be gone in 3-6 more weeks (given the depth to them). Overall, would recommend to anyone!"
2,would never order from here,I have used it since it came out and I love it'll ordered it from here because of the great price. I wasted my money because I had to go out and buy it again at my usual place. The product I was sent had the same packaging and tube but I used it and it is very greasy and left a residue on my face. I would never order from here again.
1,money dwon the drain,"I used it for 2 months, twice a day. It didn't make any difference on my skin. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,save your money,i bought this back when they were selling it for 99 dollars. i bought it to use on stretch marks i already have. i have some deep ones and some that are not deep just discolored. Did not improve any stretch marks. Save your money it won't make a difference at all.
5,"Finally, somehting that works!","There are so many products to choose from and I have tried many of them, most recently Rejuvinol and the other being AlphaDerma CE that just dried my skin and I ended up breaking out from them. It was horrible. someone at my office recommended Strivectin and I gave it a try. It not only completely cleared up my skin but got rid of my crows feet and forehead wrinkles. And to think, I've wasted soooooo much money on other products that didn't work!!!"
2,A weak book,"Joya Chatterji has woven a story that is neither convincing nor well written. The author seems to work toward an agenda of his/her own - facts are selected, pruned, sometimes modified, to fit the author's predetermined world view. Consequently, reading the book becomes a drag for anyone looking for objective recounting of the turbulent history of Bengal. If you are looking for credible source of information and history on the partition of Bengal, I would strong advise you to skip this book."
3,Much small than it appears in the picture.,"This table is only 30"" X 48"". It is a breakfast table no more. Don't expect to feed your family dinner on this. It is a nice table and the chairs are adequate once you put them together, but next time I'll go ahead and get the one the local furnature store had. This is the third time I've bought furnature on-line, and I'm embarassed to say I didn't learn my lesson."
1,Very Misleading,"Picture shows table and chairs, description does not say Chairs not included, very misleading. Sent it back for false advertising."
2,Did not include any chairs...,This price was phenomenal to me and my wife; she recommend I buy this set. When itarrive I see the box looks a little light and to my shock it was only the table!Now why show a picture with chairs when it is only table? I am not returning itbecause it is much hassle. Table is very good condition so it is good.Just remember: CHAIRS ARE NOT INCLUDED!
1,I need my chairs back,"I didn't open package yet, because they didn't send chairs with. If they don't sell chairs why they still put them together to confuse people?"
3,good for two people,"sturdy table, smaller than what it looks in picture. easy to assemble... they should not show chairs in the picture if that is not included in order..overall nice table"
3,"Real wood, but smaller than it looks","First off, no chairs. The chairs in the picture are just props. Some people expected four chairs + a table? Get real.Second, it is made of real wood, probably pine. Look closely at the table top and you will see the zig-zag joints all over, so they are not solid boards.Third, subtract about 1/2"" from the dimensions.Fourth, an additional 10"" width would have been more desirable, even 6 inches. I would have paid more and it would have been more stable.Fifth, seems a little unstable on a flat wooden floor. You can rock it back and forth about a half inch in the '30 inch dimension. The '48 inch' dimension is more stable.Mine came with a slight ding on the edge. Not sure how that happened because it was well packed and not mistreated by delivery.That said, it's good for the money spent. It's nowhere near worth the list price."
2,Not a strong finish....,"Ken MacLoeds books are usually a complex but ultimately satisfying read. The first two books of this trilogy fitted into that description but this third book, Engine City, missed the mark. I found myself skipping through pages which is something I usually never do. It seemed like this was a very disjointed finish to a story that had started out really well in books one and two.I look forward to his next work...although may not a trilogy."
4,Quite satisfying ending to a fine series.,"This concluding novel in the Engines Of Light series just doesn't quite stand on it's own meriets, but should be read as the last part of the series.This is definitely ""hard"" science-fiction, and therefore slow reading at times. But the concepts here are fascinating as such themes as flying saucers and alien abductions are woven together with the intermingling of life forms in a future interplanetary society. Quite highly recommended."
5,Inspiring stories of women conquering all.,"I think this book would be enjoyed by women new to rock climbing and mountaineering as well as seasoned climbers. It made me laugh and cry but more than anything it inspired me to accomplish the feats these women did. I grew up loving the outdoors but these stories gave me new personal goals. The women share stories filled with fear, accomplishment and the importance of the group as a means to an end. You also gain a sense of the writers personalities by their writing style which makes it fun to read."
2,Too basic; get Let's Learn Katakana instead,"This is a nice book with many beautiful illustrations and colors, which makes it great for kids, but it doesn't help much with learning Katakana. All the characters are there with the proper strokes, but nothing is mentioned about important concepts like how to end strokes (tome - ""stop""; hane - ""jump""; harai - ""sweep"") and diacritical marks (changing ka into ga for example). I feel that it is a very limited learning tool.On the other hand, I highly recommend ""Let's Learn Katakana"" (Let's Learn Katakana: Second Book of Basic Japanese Writing) and the other books from that series."
3,It's ok,"I bought both Hiragana and Katakana. I thought they were card. :(It's ok, nothing to go wild about"
4,Worth the money,"This bag is indeed heavy duty canvas construction, and it is better made than ones I have seen locally. It makes an ideal laundry bag, as it is quite large. The product arrived promptly through the mail. The one I received did have ""USN"" stenciled on it."
2,Sound is decent but songs lacking,"This is not one of my faves. The sound in 5.1 seems like it works alright, but the mic-job or something was a bit week (like they put the microphones too far from the sound sources.) The songs are a bit week too but a few are decent. Probably OK to have on your shelf just to say you have some B.M."
3,it's ok,"It's fine, but I haven't played it since the day I received it a month or two ago. I think that says something right there. Thus, I wouldn't recommend anyone pay a premium price for it, that's for sure."
5,"Looped, there it is....","Despite the dichotomy of character backgrounds, Mr. Winston deftly binds the stories together into a tight single treatise on the human experience. Chicagoans will delight in the subtle textures of their own landscape, but outsiders will also appreciate these subtleties in helping define their Chicago. Few novels have me laughing out loud as Looped did. It is clearly a work of a humorist, poet, keen observer and novelist all in one. Looped is not to be missed."
5,Wow,"Of all the books I read this year, I'm happy to have made time for this one. The characters were engaging and their stories were carefully interwoven. The book reveals something insightful about Chicago and the people who live here."
3,Tim,"Don't let the name fool you: this book only has one chapter on the zone press. Nevertheless, this is a pretty good, old school basketball guide. It's got some good stuff; in fact, although the pressing section is pretty good, the best section is on building an offense with pick and roll and cuts."
5,Shame it hasn't received more attention,"I was a bit skeptical about a film with live lions and a bunch of British actors doing the voice-overs. I was surprised at how well this A&E and BBC original film turned out! It's witty, clever and entertaining, even for an adult like me. Kate Winslet is truly enjoyable in the lead role. I hope she does more voice-overs in the near future."
1,Mis informed,"The item did not specify what region it was, I ended up buying it but can't watch it due to the lack of DVD/computer devices to play it on(to change the region on) I'm sure this product would be fine if I was actually able to use it. A waste of money on my part."
1,This is NOT a children's movie!,"Finding the good in this film would be like finding a needle in a haystack. No, more like a manure pile! But, nevertheless, I'll try. Let's see, the plot was decent, excellent voice talent, ineresting characters, and it had a good family values message. But any moral value is lost amidst the lewd sexual comments of the resident males at almost every scene that they are featured in, and disgusting amount of adult humor that would most likely go right over any normal kid's head. But wait! The film doesn't stop just at verbal implications! I, on the other hand, will not go any further.In closing, do yourself a favor: DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. YOU WILL WASTE NINETY PRECIOUS MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE."
1,Very Poor Study Guide,"First of all, I really get a kick out of the so-called experienced Administrators and their comments. Any of you have had at most a little over 2 years experience with these products, which hardly allows you to be condescending to your peers! It's foolish to chastise others for their approach to furthering their marketability. In fact, I applaud those who are trying to find information sources to help them get certified. It is very difficult to have a job diverse enough to get exposed to every product. That being said, this book is by far the worst of any study guide I have used. After reading, I was no better prepared or had a deeper understanding of IIS than before. The Sybex and New Riders books are better when it comes to the MCSE electives. Here are my recommendations for study guides (I am both an MCSD and MCSE): NT - the IDG book that covers all 3 is the best NET ESS-New Riders TCP/IP-Also New Riders SQL 6.5 Admin-Sybex"
1,What a dissapointment!,"I've been using the Syngress MCSE series for all my past exams with great success and liked the structure of the books. But don't be fooled by this one. This book misses several objectives, and it doesn't even mention the ODBC error codes which are scrutinized on the exam. Look for another book, don't waste your money on this one!"
1,This book is a JUNKY... Don't waste you Money,"Poor writing, poor examples, poor contents.. this book is a loser. Don't waste your time and money on this book"
1,You can buy mine,This book has more screen shot than paragraphs. If you expect to pass the exam get a more indept study guide
4,Good Overall Review For The Experienced Administrator,"I get very disappointed with people who expect to read a book and pass a Certification exam. The objective behind reading the book is to expose yourself to the software and famliarize yourself with the sections of which you do not understand. The only way to pass and exam is combine experience with the software, books, manuals, and sometimes test prep software. Well anyway, this book is very well written and has a wealth of information for the experienced administrator who needs to brush up or someone totally new to the software. If you expect to read the book and sit for the exam well then this is the wrong book for you. But if You are like me and like to be more than a paper MCSE this book is a great place to start. The only problem I did find is it takes a short look at Index Server and MTS which are two very important parts of IIS 4.0"
1,Does not cover all objectives,This book does not deal with all the certification objectives. It is probably not enough reading material for passing the IIS 4.0 Exam. Also like the other Osborne -McGraw Hill Series has typos and errors. When I wrote the IIS 4.0 exam 30-40% questions dealt with topics not covered in the book. Should wait for next edition
4,Costco Wholesale's Dirty Little Secrets,"Fairly informative, but one sided. Everyone should read ""Costco's Dirty Little Secrets"" to get an inside view of the other side of Costco.Behind the obvious successes are the warts, foibles and untold causalities among Costco suppliers. Shady, sometimes arbitrary, sometimes unscrupulous corporate policies and vendor practices are common. The book's 12 chapters will peel back the mystique to expose shattered hopes and permanently deferred dreams of once promising businesses.This book is a ""must"" read for Costco's 47 million cardholding members who will learn that portions of Costco's ruthless business philosophy is without conscience or accountability.[...]"
2,Picture looks more apealing than the product.,"OK watch, but the picture makes the watch look great. I bought the watch about a year ago and have worn it once... Not a great looking watch in person."
2,little more than an expensive fan magazine,"I was disappointed in the book because I thought it would be objective, historical information about the cast, crew and production. I've read teeny bopper ""Teen Beat"" fan magazines w/ more credibility than this book. The pictures are nice but many of the captions have wrong information (such as what's going on in the episode at the time of the scene). As a prior reviewer states, most of the ""essays"" allegedly written by characters are actually ""out of character"", either using language or referring to events not used by those characters in the show. There is almost no historical information--such as a listing of episode titles and dates shown or information about the actors,writers, directors and/or producers who were the driving force behind this great show. All in all, it's useful only for the pictures."
2,Very bubble gum teenie bopper style,"The book didn't even mention the shows creator, Paul Haggis, his sister producer and writer Kathy Slevin or producer Jeff King. That's just incredible in my mind! It's got lots of great photos but aside from that, not much else. Also, most of the websites listed at the back have long since expired, of course that's expected with print material."
5,Fulfills the need to learn more about Due South,"Today we are so overwhelmed with negative messages. Due South is positive..the script uses English, not profanity..the portrayal of friendship is the best feature, but the story line is also varied and a reality check. Just can't watch it enough, so the book helps keep track of the episodes."
2,Release button does not work,"The concept works as far as creating a tight vacuum, but the release button does nothing and the stopper is so tight I can't get it open?"
1,Ugly and Pricey,"Unless you like the Ehrlenmeyer flask look for your chemistry lab table motif, pass this one up. You can get the benefits of vacuum wine saver technology for $14 by purchasingVacu Vin Wine Saver Gift Pack, WhiteorWine Saver gift pack black. As far as serving the wine, - use the bottle or buy a nicer looking decanter with your $45 in savings."
1,Doesn't Work!,"I ordered the Metrokane from Amazon and was greatly disappointed. The top does not fit into the decanter well at all, the ""seal"" that is formed is horrible, and pumping air out doesn't do a thing. In short, this doesnt work!"
4,Product Good Shipping Not So Good,"Product arrived on time, unfortunately DHL soaked the box (looked like it had been floating in a pond). The company was great, got right back to me. Haven't used the product yet, it is a gift, but was pleased with my dealings with them!"
4,user error,"I purchased this from another website and decided to see if it really worked. So after several attempts of pumping the darn thing, I was going to give up and return it, however after reading some of the reviews here I learned that you have to PULL the button UP from the decanter to one release the air and 2 seal the air. This thing really works and I can't wait to use it again. Totally worth it even though I overpaid for it."
1,Product was a no show,i have yet to receive the product i purchased. i have been charged and still do not have the product. pls advose when this will happen or i will my credit card company request reimbursement.
2,"No lead, that's good. Pour could be better.","I bought this decanter mainly because it was lead-free crystal. I am uncomfortable storing wine in lead crystal because the lead can leach into the wine. The vacuum was a bonus, though after a few hours the vacuum is lost. It drips a little on the pour, resulting in a wine ring gathering on any surface it sits on. I'm guessing there are better lead-free crystal decanters out there."
5,Greatest thing since sliced bread,"This is a SUPER product...my only criticism would be a lack of instruction on how to use it...after you insert and push the 'cork' down, you must PULL UP on the little 'knob'...then you have to pump it 30-35 times to bring the needle into the red zone...the wine will keep at least 5 days (i haven't tried it longer)...then PUSH DOWN on the 'knob' to release the pressure when you want to use the wine...using a thumb on each side of the 'cork' push it up up remove it...NO RE-PUMPING IS NECESSARY...the price is reasonable...if you save a couple of bottles of wine, it pays for itself..i am going to get more for gifts...GREAT PRODUCT....LOVE IT"
3,New shoes,"Upon receiving these shoes that were advertised as new, one of them was scuffed and each shoe was a slightly different color of brown."
5,galapagos in an amazing way,"I usually don't write my opinion about photo books but this one left me in shock, i've never seen anything like it before,I buy alot of photo books and i already own more than a hundred photo books from the best and most famous photographers and there are plenty that i like and some that i love,but this one Oh this one is so very special to me because the first time i looked at the pictures of this book i had tears in my eyes of enthusiasm and this is something that never happened to me before and as i said i looked at many photographs in my life,the subjects and the way they were shot ,the way she played with the colors ,it seems so natural and yet very unique and special every one of the pictures of this book could be hung on my home walls as a poster . many of the photo books are big and expensive but this one is the real thing without being a monster with no place on the shelf. if i had to go with one book to a desert island there's no question this is the one."
5,Magnificent Galapagos,"I first saw this book at an hacienda on the slopes of Cotopaxi in mainland Ecuador, before our trip to the islands. I thought that if the islands were as good as the photos in this book I wouldn't be dissappointed. I was right - and I bought the book when I got home as a reminder of our trip! Although we took many photos they're not a patch on those in this book. The photography is superb. An absolute must for all visitors to the Islands."
4,Great Book,After travelling to the Galapagos last year for a holiday I wanted a book that would act as a good reminder of my holiday. This is a great book and I would recommend it to others.The Galapagos is a great place and this book does it justice.
4,A Good Alternative To Jahiem or R. Kelly,"And I like those artists as well. Still, Babyface is what classic R & B is all about! Nice sounds. Good intrument arrangement. Lyrics are sexy without being blatant. Very inticing without getting graphic. Babyface keeps it real.While I don't own this album, I have heard the majority of the songs on it so I can give this collection a big thumbs up!"
5,The best writer/singer @}->---,"Babyface has always been a favourite of mine from way back. I listened to him back in the late 80's - early 90's before It's No Crime and he's always been amazing.One of the most stunning songs ever ever ever is Soon As I Get Home. It oozes romance and it's stunning. Whip Appeal is a classic slow jam that I still love, and For The Cool In You is a slightly more recent funky song. There is no bad song on here. Maybe he's not in the exact same league as Luther or Peabo, but he's still in my top 5 all time male artists. He's the King of romantic soul ballads and he's very, very talented. If you like slow jams and fantastic bedroom music, then go get this. I love it."
5,The Best in LoveMaking and Grown Man Music,"Babyface has been in the game for close to 30 years and love songs is a collection of some of best ballads. The CD starts out with the smooth and sultry I Said I Love You then goes into All Day All Thinkin and from then on it's smooth, sensual lovemaking, baby making,getting married quiet storm classics. Whip Appeal, Sunshine, When Can I See You Again, For The Cool In You there all here, but my all time favorite Babyface song is Soon As I Get Home it's helped me get plenty of women."
4,Truly a nice compilation of who Babyface is,"This album showcases what makes Babyface...smooth voice, touching lyrics and great production. He knows the sounds of what folks want to hear whether for him or other entertainers."
2,Disappointing 'Octoberland' lacks compelling story,"'Octoberland' never lives up to the brilliant fantasy of the first two volumes of the Irth trilogy.Author Lee uses a modified version of the awkward chapter structure he used in 'The Wolf and the Crown'. Lee almost completely abandons the world of Irth, focusing his story on The Dark Shore or Irthlings who immerse themselves in Dark Shore culture.Where are the Spiderlands? Or the aelves? Those stories both had the potential for great fantasy. What was most lacking though was the presence of Lord Drev, a central character in book 1 of the trilogy. One can argue that his story has already been told, but his was a fascinating character that I, for one, would have liked to read more about."
5,October Land may not be The Dark Shore but it is so GREAT!,"I love everything about this book. I'm not one for giving away the plot, so you have to figure out that for yourself. If you read this for the plot or to see some story line well I won't give you that. What I will tell you is that I could not put it down.. Adam Lee is a great author that needs to be recognized..."
4,Nice and worth the price,I am very pleased with this basketFits nicely in the unit I am ordering another oneColors are rich and very nicely made
1,Not as advertised,"Briefly (because I'm angry and don't want to deal with this):1). The dimensions may be that of the wire frame, but not the finished product. More like 11.5x13.5x13.5 MINIMUM. I had a cubby hole that fits 13"" bins. I bought four of these, and they're .5"" too big. Who will compensate me for my time?2) the smell is pretty rancid, and severallocations have torn weaving.Point is, these are not worth the money I paid, and are not the dimensions I needed."
4,Their Second Best Release,"Repeater has masterful production,solid playing,singing (hey my bandmates and I [The Beltways]helped out with the backups on Dixie Liquor And Beer)and writing. Another cool album from a very talented band. It's easily their second best release;Ultrasound still gets the 5 star rating from me just because of the ""fun factor"" of the tunes,but that's just my taste.Repeator does show some musical growth,but sometimes primitive is more ""fun"".If you are into indie pop you won't be dissappointed;this band is cream of the crop!!"
2,"An average, not great, re-lease.","People rave about this band and I'm not sure why.Out of theashes of The Greenbury Woods ( a truly great band) Splitsville does'ntlive up to the hype. ""Why can't it be"" is the album's highlight, a nice acoustic guitar based pop number, it reminded me a little bit like the Beatle's Rubber/Revolver era. Other than that this is sub par power ""punk"" that has more in common with Green Day than Big Star or the Rasberries."
1,"A current release in the US, but, not the originals","For the true Bobby Rydell fan, it's necessary to buy one of the imports that are available. It would be much better if ABKCO got off their duff and released all of the old Cameo-Parkway hits."
2,Not the orignial sounds I grew up with,"When I ordered Bobby Rydell(Greatest hits)I thought I was getting the original songs sung by him when I was young. The cover showed a young Bobby Rydell, but the music was redone by him now. I did not like the sound. so I returned the CD. When I order a CD I expect the original sounds. Not a remake version. Somewhere on the CD you should inform listerners that this is not the Original songs but a remake. Thank You."
2,Not original recordings,"If you are a Bobby Rydell fan and have nothing, I recommend this album. If you want to hear Bobby as you heard him on the radio back in the good old days, this CD is not for you. This CD is a remake that doesn't quite live up to the original recordings."
5,Great Calendar,"This calendar offers daily bits of interesting information, from gardening tips to what stage the moon is in! This is a great calendar for all to enjoy."
2,Make Room for Daddy DVD from Amazon,"Was anxious to watch these shows but the thrill wore out shotly thereafter. It was a let down. The quality of the DVD was excellent but guess that era was a bit boring compared to the present, as far as TV shows go. Watched maybe two or three episodes and decided to shelf it until someone way want to watch it or take it home."
2,I got what I paid for.,"I paid $4.50 for the earrings and that is exactly what they are worth. I was looking for anything ruby shaped like a heart and I did not have much to choose from. I was hoping even though these were priced very low that they would be a little bit better quality but like I said, I got what I paid for so I guess it is okay."
1,Waste of Money - Avoid like the plague,"I have had some success in recording things on Sony DVD-R disc, so no problem there. My main complaint with this device is with playing previously recorded titles. It simply won't load the disc up. All we get is an endless disc spinning in the upper left corner of the screen. To get it out of the machine, it has become necessary to unplug the machine, plug it back in, and then start hitting the eject button on the remote. It plays the discs that it has recorded, just not store bought movies. LG should stop advertising Life is Good. LG should stand for Lousy Garbage. Stay away from LG for the rest of your life. Don't make the same mistake we did."
1,Add Me to the List,"I bought one of these and was very pleased with it for about a year. Then, all of a sudden, inside a week, it stopped recognizing commercial dvds. Now it won't recognize anything. LG does not have a fix. From massive internet complaints, this is a common problem I have two LG internal DVD writers on my computers and have no problem with them. I cannnot figure out where the problem is. LG DOES NOT have firmware upgrades or anything useful on the web site. I have reached a dead end. I'm probably going to junk it. Don't waste your money."
1,15 days after the 90 day warrant and it's unusable,"I've never had this happen so quickly with a consumer electronic product but this dvd vhs combo unit stopped working altogether only 105 days into my ownership. The dvd portion is not able to read my Netflix disks and, adding insult to injury, it now won't eject it. Ouch! Time to get the sledge hammer. Seriously, I would consider another product based on my experience."
1,Not ready for prime time,"You would be well-advised to avoid this product. My son-in-law and I both bought one of these at the same time and have had the same (poor) experience. The playback quality of DVDs and VCRs are both excellent - when they work. However, this thing will not read half of the discs I put in it, including discs it has made itself. When you call their customer service, they recommend that you buy a DVD cleaner. Please! Even in the best of times, it takes an inordinate time just to spin-up a disc and read it. Many times after reading it for several minutes, it will reject the disc. Sometimes if you just close the door, it will read it. This product is not ready for prime time."
1,Audio Drops Constantly,"This unit drives me crazy. rarely use the unit and waited too long to return/exchange at Best Buy. The audio drops out every few seconds. Both the digital and analog feeds are affected. On last day of warranty, LG agreed to repair or replace. Got a reconditioned replacement and it too has the same problems. I wish I would have read reviews before purchasing. This was a lot of money to pay for lousy audio. Otherwise, picture an ease of use is nice."
2,Cannot recognize discs 8 months out,"Unfortunately, add my family to the list of people burned by this poor quality product. It did work well in the beginning so I gave it two stars instead of one. It fails to recognize most commercial disks at this point. I did not heavily use the unit, so it took longer to realize there were problems. From the other posts on this site, it looks like I am out of luck . The trouble is, I would have given this four or five stars during the first few months. Beware. I sincerely hope this device is not for sale any longer."
1,LG RC199H's HDMI does not work with Samsung TV,"I purchased an LG RC199H to go with a new Samsung 2641 LCD TV. I could get the LG to communicate with the TV via component video cables or via coaxial cable, but not via HDMI. I spent many, many hours over 5 days, trying everything I could think of the get the HDMI connection to work. I called Samsung many times, had the HDMI cable and the LG tested at the store where I purchased them, even exchanged the TV, thinking it was the problem. I called Samsung technical service many times and, when I finally called LG, I found that Samsung TVs and HG recorders often cannot communicate via HDMI. The Samsung and LG technicians tried very hard to help me get my system set up for HDMI but nothing worked. I finally took the LG back where I purchased it and got a refund."
1,LG RC199H - Save your Money,"I bought one of these units and it is horrible. It will not read/use/format blank DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW so it is only good as a DVD player. When you call tech support they will tell you to buy Mitshibusi DVD (only availabe in Australia). Other formats they claim will have 95% failure rates when trying to record. I tried Verbatium, Memorex, Toshiba and they all failed with 90% error rates or moreSave your money, buy anything other than LG, I know I'll never buy an LG product as I feel cheated by the product and slighted by customer service."
1,LG released a prototype product for the customer to test.,"I still have this DVD/VCR recorder combo collecting dust for it failed after about six months when I purchased it late 2006/2007. $330.00 at that time. At the time when it failed, nobody really knew what the problem was. Understand people, LG could care less. I will never purchase or allow someone I know (even my enemies) purchase a LG product again. Now that the unit has been out for some years, the main problem has come to light. The most common failure is the DVD deck..which can be replaced at a cost around $40-$120, depending on whether you do it yourself or not."
1,FRUSTRATING MACHINE,Add me to the list of frustrated LG customers. We bought the speel at Best Buy about the great quality of this player. (by the way it is no longer being made)It is not great quality the DVD quit after minimal use it spins and spins and can not read the DVDs. After trying to find someone to work on it is a joke the merced best buy operator told me the folks that fix those things have been run out of town whatever that means. When I reached an LG service place they said it would cost me $75 just to come look at it and then to find out to try and get it fixed is a joke. Oh wait no it will require one arm and one leg. Anyway my advise to myself as well as others is check the product reviews before buying it will save you a lot of headaches.
1,Not good,"DVD reader died in 6 mos. $70 labor + shipping to ""fix"" it.I guess LG isn't too concerned about their brand."
2,Works great for a while then...,"I really liked this unit a lot when I first purchased it. I had some issues with the HDMI output and my Plasma screen being green but a power cycle always solved it. 6 months into owning it is when the real trouble started. In the middle of a movie suddenly the unit would freeze. No amount of voodoo would get it out of it's slumber. Unplugging was the only option. At this stage, it will only reliably play 1 out of 3 DVDs and won't even recognize some that it used to. This thing is being tossed in the can once I find a Non-LG replacement."
1,Done with LG and Best Buy,"Too bad Amazon makes me rate at least a one because this player is a zero. We purchased it in July 06 but used it very little. I would guess we've used it less than 10 times. After about the 3rd use, it quit reading commercial discs. I tried disabling the auto-play feature to see if that would help and it did not. I can eject and reload the disc 20 times and it might evenutally play. These are the same problems that everyone else is complaining about. I only wish I was within my American Express warranty period or had purchased the extended warranty. I have no other problems with it...records OK, plays mini dvd's from my camcorder, VCR works, reads camera card but don't try to play a danged movie!"
1,Do Not Purchase,"For fear of sounding like a broken record, I too have had problems with this device. It will not play most DVD's, and those that it will play freeze up on playback. The device gets confused as to whether it is on or off, and will not eject disks unless you first unplug and plug back in. Customer service is next to useless and the only thing worse than the warranty is Best Buys return policy (or lack thereof). Do not purchase this product; do not purchase from Best Buy; do not pass go; do not collect $100."
4,Book Is Best When You Just Leaf Through,"I thought the book was great. It taught me a great deal. It actually turns out that, I found that it came to me easier when I leafed through it. It was so colorful with knowledge that if you started reading it cover to cover, you probably will get bored to death. Looking for what you want to know and look for it. That simple. :)"
3,One of the best live bands I have ever seen!!!,"Until last weekend it was BNL, with their obvious mastry of their art and they way they simply have fun and involve the crowd. But I must say, with all due respect, Watercress may have edged them out. Even did a few mantages of old stuff like Under Pressure and some Led Zepplin of all things! Altought the CD lacks the sound engineering of major label bands, it helps anyone who has seen them in person relive some of the show. Can't wait for their next one!"
2,MGI has extra features,"I own the MGI Navigator, and you may think this is the Licoln Navigator but the MGI is the Bently.It has a seat with compartment, a sand bucket for filling your divots, a holder for your umbrella, best of all, when you are on a side hill it does not follow the slope of the hill but rather stays straight on course. Mine does have the solid wheels and yes, pins. If you don't run it into things the pins will last for a very long time and all carts will have the battery issue. That's a battery issue not a cart issue.I have had several remote caddies, and this is tops, don't see how the bag boy can beat it.I am retired, play golf in Palm Desert for 7 months of the year 5 days a week and have NO affliation with MGI just think it's the best!"
2,A disappointing book,"I was extremely disappointed by this book which is by far below the usual quality I expect from Microsoft Press books.The style is somewhat verbose and the text constantly invite you to read other sources.Besides, technical explanations sway heavily between stating the obvious and ""trust me, I know what I'm talking about"".The chapters about XML an COM+ are poors, to say the least.I would only recommend this book if you are starting a Windows DNA project in VB andyou know nothing about the subject."
1,Time not accurate & Outside temperature not reliable,"I own another La Crosee product and have to say its a lot better than this one. To begin with the atomic clock is not accurate. I've compared it to several atomic clocks on the internet including the one in Colorado which is the official US time and it is consistently runs fast by approximatey 1 minute. The temperature display is finiky too sometimes loosing the signal of the remote and providing no signal even though its less than 10 feet and 2 walls from the temperature transmitter. Finally when you press the top snooze/light bar to use the light, only the alarm time is displayed so you can't check the actual time in the dark!"
5,Excellent,"Great clock. I never have to adjust the time! I know the time, date, temperature in and out. Great alarm!"
2,A good start,"When searching for a book to teach about families, I came across ""Love is a Family"" at a local library. I was immediately drawn to the title because it provided exactly the message that I was trying to teach. As I read, the story starts off endearing and touching. Love is a Family unfortunately only includes heterosexual families. I only wish that this story went just a bit further to include all kids of families, where love is what binds you together. The absence of homosexual families was extremely disappointing to me."
5,One Of Our Favorite Books!!!,"This book put into words everything I was trying to convey to my daughter but did not know how to make approachable for young kids and they do it in a really adorable story. I love how this book describes many different family styles and differences but then goes on to give examples of ways those families show they love each other. We borrowed ""Do I Have A Daddy"" from the library but I purchased this here on Amazon sight unseen and the tone of this one feels much for positive than the latter. This book does not address families with two mommies or two daddies, if you are looking for book that shows many different families consider The Great Big Book of Families by Mary Hoffman. Not only do I adore LOVE IS A FAMILY but my five year old daughter does as well. Well worth purchasing!!!!"
5,Great Shoe for Wide Width!,"I bought this for my sister who had a recent surgery and needed supportive shoes, for her rehab and walking and returning to work. She always had problems with finding shoes to fit her wide width. She is thrilled with these shoes!"
4,Brilliant! For People Who Like Electronics Deep,"Jhno is not only the author of this CD and others, he is the programming whiz behind much of Pluggo, the most fabulous music-making plug-ins. This CD offers pseudo-gamelan, wonderful sounds swirling about, Rhodes-sounding chords, a subdued, bass-heavy vortex of scary stuff... (I've managed to scare people with this album twice) and a wonderful track - little yellow car (take me far mix) that transports me every time I listen to it. Truly a favorite that I like to play for people who think they are into expermimental electronica or drum and bass but haven't heard of this guy. Deserving of many listens. (But my dad said - ""sounds like you could hit the repeat button on the CD player for that one...."" he's into bebop. ;-)"
5,Amazing and Consistent,"I think this is one of the best artists and releases in this genre. Everything Jhno does is great, and this CD is one of my favorite. Also... Get ""Membrane"" if you can find it."
2,"Cheap price, cheaply made","Great price on a 48in pipewrench, but you get what you pay for. The spring clip inside the throar which holds the adjustable jaw was improperly installed and fell out. The wrench will function without it but it takes more effort. If you only need an occassional use tool it's ok, but if you plan to use it often, spend more and get a better quality tool."
2,Applied Chemical Hydrogeology,I purchased and used this as an alternate textbook to Drever's Geochemistry of Natural Waters for a graduate level course in Chemical Hydrogeology that I took during completion of my Masters. This is very similar and almost identical to Drever's text. This is not a text that should be used for quantitative problem solving.
4,buyer beware,"For some reason known only to Amazon, these bread crumbs pop up third in the list when you search for gluten free bread crumbs. I trusted the search (and all the others it found seem to be gluten free) and didn't read far enough down in the description (so yes, this is completely my fault) and, since this was a subscribe and save deal, ordered these. I just got them today and discovered that I can't use - or return - any of the six containers I ordered because they are not, in fact, gluten free. It would be nice if there were some way that items containing gluten did NOT pop up in a search for items that do not contain it. I'm giving them four stars anyway because I'm sure they probably taste lovely. I will never know."
5,Best Organic Breadcrumbs,I have no ordered a total of 12 Edward & Sons Organic Breadcrumbs: Italian style and wow are these high quality. I use them for all facets of cooking and the taste and quality as well as lack of preservatives make this seasoning a terrific purchase. I highly recommend.
1,Never received product,I ordered this as a Christmas gift. My order got lost in the Christmas rush. Finally got my money reimbursed after a few emails. Not happy!!Would not buy from again.
3,Has sarcastic humor,"If you appreciate sarcastic humor in a book on health, this book may be descent for you. However, the information has too much common sense. (Water helps flush down bacteria, which can cause bad breath.. like the waterslides at a water park help push the people down). This type of humor is used throughout, and talks down to the reader. The sarcastic humor makes it wonder how true the information is. Luckily, the principles taught here are very rudimentary, it may not pose a problem, but then why are you reading about something you know in the first place?"
2,YOU: The Owner's Manual : An Insider's Guide to the Body that Will Make You Healthier and Younger,There were too many dumb jokes and real world comparisions in this book. I was hoping to learn something about my body and how it worked that I didn't already know. It contained the same old information that we learned in Health class years ago with a alot of dumb jokes thrown in. I had heard about this book on the Oprah show and probably learned all I needed to know there. I was very disappointed.
4,"Good book, but a little disappointed","This was a good book, with some great information, but I expected more from an Oprah book.I do recommend it though because you can find some really great things that could save you years in your life. Enjoy it."
1,Elementary at Best,"I first heard of this book from watching a segment of Oprah. I must say that she and the author(s) presented the material so well on the show that I was quite eager to learn more from buying the book. Sad to say that I was very disappointed when I finally received it. The Oprah show covered just about everything worth knowing, that you really don't need to buy the book. This book is even less informative than my grade school health books and what's even more insulting is that it's written in huge print/font with large line-spacing. I suppose they wanted to make the book appear more substantial than it really is by making it 432 pages long. Reminds me of high school days when we had to meet our minimum page requirements for papers and reports. My recommendation is skip this book and buy a high school anatomy textbook instead if you're interested in learning how the human body works."
3,Everyone Should Read This Book,"Everyone should read this book, incorporate the information into your lifestyle, as even the smallest change will enhance your longevity."
3,"Love Dr. Oz, Don't Love his books",I love Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen. I watch Dr. Oz everytime he is on Oprah. I just find his books are boring and cannot make myself read the whole book. He has very good advice but I keep reading the chapters over and over because I lose interest. Sorry Dr. Oz.
4,quite educational and funny,"I really am enjoying this book, it is quite educational and funny. There is so much that I did not know and it is presented for the everyday novice and not just doctor speak. A must have for any book shelf."
3,Good but could be better,"This manual tells you the type of food that will help your body run well. The main focus of the book is the heart and digestive system which I've found to be tremendously helpful. The book was honest and opinionated, but humor has an element of surprise to it and these guys rhytmn was entirely predictable and therefore annoying."
2,Weak writing and not all factually correct,"Like one other reviewer said, if you tend to read health magazines (a la Men's Health), the facts and myths are pretty standard magazine filler pieces.There are definitely some factual mistakes. Eg. On page 167/168, the authors suggest having plants in your room as they produce oxygen. But the reality is that plants use cellular respiration at night and therefore, act like animals in terms of gas exchange -- ie. produce carbon dioxided at night.This book is _okay_ at best."
2,Take my book...PLEASE!,I am only part-way into the chapter about the heart and circulatory system and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any further. Why did they have to throw three jokes into each and every paragraph. It's practically unreadable.I think they do an excellent job of explaining the workings of the body. I need just this book. I don't like to be told to lower my cholesterol - I want to be told why I need to lower my cholesterol. The good doctors have collected everything I want to know into one book and have done a great job of it. Why did they have to spoil it by making it sound like a monologue by some poor schmuck with bad joke writers?
4,You: the owner's manual: An insider's guide to the body that will make by Michael F. Roizen,I really like this book. I refer back to it from time to time. It is a good read and if you follow his instructions you will be healthier for it. I recommend it.
5,Should be a school textbook!,"This book is great! Simple, humorous, easy-to-read! If this were a school textbook, our children would be so much more knowledgeable about their bodies!"
4,"Fun, informing book with lots of pictures","I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and ever since I was little I've feared every mole was skin cancer.It's true, ignorance leads to fear. You: the Owner's Manual takes the terror out of the unknown-i.e. the cancer scares, in a really light-hearted fun way. The ilustrations are great and I love Roizen's common sense approach to maintaining a healthy body."
3,Humorous way to Health,"Nicely written and funny. Good information for an avarage person.It lack depth, if you have a little knowledge or done some research on your own. Superfical at best."
3,Useful information but,"While there is an abundance of useful information here, I would have preferred to have it without, what I consider to be, an excessive attempt to be humorous. The low level jokes tend to get old after about the first 50 or so. The book could have had 5% - 10% fewer pages if they had just cut out the useless comedy."
1,YOU don't need this book,"Full of useless information that has been around for a long time. We've heard all of this before: drink lots of water, eat fish three times a week, brush and floss your teeth, don't put a q-tip in your ear, blah, blah blah. The book seems to be written for the elementry grade level with its cartoon-like illustrations of little elves living in your bones and the cancer cells with their angry faces. If there are a few pearls of wisdom in here anywhere, it would be hard to find them because the ""humorous"" writing style is simply obnoxious. The constant failed attempts at humor make the reading almost unbearable."
2,Juvenile,"The information in this book, as vital as it is, is obstructed by juvenile illustrations and language. The authors assume that readers know nothing about the human body, and therefore resort to immature metaphors depicting wild spring break parties. Illustrations of body organs and parts would be great if not for the strange elf-like creatures inhabiting them."
1,Want the Reader's Digest version?,"I'll give it to you in one word: poop. You want it explained a bit more thoroughly? Poop a lot. In more detail? Poop many, many times per day and make sure they are all good, healthy poops that slide right into the toilet. No plop, plop, fizz, fizz types. In all honesty, that's theses 432 pages in a nutshell. Save your dough, you've now read the book. Now go poop."
4,Loved this book!,"WOW! The human body is amazing. This books covers the basics, but for the average Joe, it tells you all you need to know. Great reading and a terrific reference. A must read!"
5,Getting to know yourself rocks!,This book is a definite myth buster and a good guide to help you understand your body. I would recommend it to anybody!
2,"Again, too cute","Same as `You on a Diet'....condescending and annoying writing. Surely these guys are bright enough to convey their message more respectfully to their readers. Alas, they chose not to do so."
2,A little too flip,"This book is a little too flip in it's writing. Too casual, though the information seems legitimate"
4,a great guide to great health,"Written in a way that everyone can relate to. Some very good recipe's to healthy dishes. If you want to get to know your insides and outsides and how they work, this title says it all."
5,Everyone should have this book,"This is a great book, with easy-to-understand information about how YOUR body works. The humor keeps the topics light (and the reader awake) without losing the punch of the information. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone."
5,Great and informative information,"This goes into detail how your body works, and what happens when we don't give our body what it needs for fuel. It is a pretty easy read with lots of humor in it."
5,Great Overview of How to Take Care of Your Body,"This is the best book I have read on how to take care of your body. As a former PreMed major, I can honestly say I learned more about what I need to do to live a healthy life than I did in all my Biology & Zoology classes. This is an easy to read book that is fun and entertaining while being very educational...highly recommended."
3,"Sort of CHEESY, But still pretty informative","I read this book, and then re-read it. It has a lot of good information, but a lot of cutsie, duh YouREEKA stupid lines that make it just hard to want to read. The recipes and the info are pretty well hiden in there, but worth reading and at least helping Oprah get yet another one of her friends rich. I like Dr Oz, on the shows, but this book is almost TOO CUTE for me."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't think much of the tone of this book. It seemd like it was written for children. With all of the information available on websites such as WebMD, I think the general adult population is a bit more savvy than the authors give us credit for."
4,"Smart, simple ways to care for your body","In the words of Oprah's favorite doctor, Mehmet C. Oz, and his co-author, Michael F. Roizen, ""We're not going to make the science simplistic; we're going to make it simple."" Their book describes how your body works in understandable, engaging terms and gives you an easy-to-follow strategy for making adjustments that will extend your life and improve your health. Roizen and Oz take you on a tour of your body, beginning with the heart and covering all the organs. They include a realistic diet and workout plan, fun illustrations and answers to common questions. getAbstract recommends this guide to all those well-intentioned people who know they should eat right and exercise more, but want to understand why."
5,I learned so much by reading this book!,"I love this book. I have read most of it cover to cover, and I have about 3 chapters left and I feel like already I am making smarter diet and fitness decisions. It has motivated me in that I think about what I put into my body and what I do to excercise....I cannot wait to start the YOU on a Diet book.....I bought it and am going to read it next. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys learning and wants to improve their quality of life by simply learning what your body needs to operate at its best."
4,"You, the insider.","Written with alot of humor, very pictorial and helpful. If you want to know more about what goes on in your body read this book! Very insightful."
2,much to simplistic,"I expected much more out of this manual. It was way to simple for me, or anyone in my family that has half of a clue as to how the body functions. I did send it to some elderly relatives, but it was useless to me."
3,Silly,"I need to say first, I'm a medical professional. I bought the book with my husband in mind. To me, the book tried to be cute, while I'm looking for information simply put. I gave it three stars because for some people some information is better than none."
5,The only one you'll need,"It is so easy & convenient & safe, above all.I can almost find anything I can think about, & books are theeasiest. I am continually surprised at the selection of allthe other products. I will support Amazon & make it very easyon myself."
2,STUPID,"I thought this book would be for adults. However, it is more for children. It has smidgens of medical information between stupid jokes.I wish I would have saved my money and just went on webmd."
2,Hire a Writer,"This book has extremely valuable info in it, But it is written in such a juevenile manner its almost unreadable. In a very poor attempt for these intelligent doctors to connect with their audience they use such stupid phrases like ""how inspired are you by Eva Longorias body"" ""Not everyone can look like Cameron Diaz"" There are hundreds of these cutesy references that show that these doctors are hip. IN a nutshell there is about 5 pages of absolutely insighful info. The rest is a very poor attempt by a teenage ghost writer. Leave the all the""cheese drowned pork roll"" quips to Dr Phil he can pull it off"
3,The Whole Picture,"Whenever I read books like this, it makes me think again that doctors just don't get it - they ignore the ""big picture"" of their patient's health and focus on treating symptoms with just Western medicine. That's their business, of course. It's up to consumers to get educated, on that I agree. We can do a lot by keeping physically fit, but what about mental fitness? Whoever talks about that? We are an aging population and more needs to be done to prevent memory loss, etc. Rather than obsolete books, I find services like Agogus.com much more ""up"" on the holistic perspective."
5,Why do we love them?,"I just read a review here. It is about two Turkish Authors. Dr. Oz and Mr. Ozturk. Those books are on the Amazon web site. I had both of them.After I finished Mr. Ozturk's book I had a question to ask myself: Why do we love those great authors? Or, we realy like them?Dr. Oz book's about our health, Mr. Umut Ozturk's book about our future as a nation. I recomend both books to the readers. You may need Dr. Oz's book as a manual and Mr. Ozturk's book as a American History reference.Dr. Oz Book's ""You: Owner's manual"" and Mr. Ozturk's book ""America Hates Me But I Still Love Her!"" will be on my shelves for future generations.I want my grand children to read both of them for healty bodies and minds.Both books would fix their hearts!"
1,self help book,"This book is for someone with a low IQ, because it is almost all common sense stuff. The writing and pictures are a poor attempt at humor.If you are seperate and don't have the balls to see a doctor, maybe this book is for you."
2,Extremely Overrated!,"I really have no idea why so many people think so highly of this book. 90% common sense, 9% fluff, and 1% brilliance. Is the information contained within this book really brand new to our society? If so, we're in a lot of trouble."
3,Gave me pause,"Im only 14 so I dont really have all the problèmes that this booch adresses, but i would say be happy and live a balanced life savouring in moderation, whether it be sex, coffée, cigarettes, or food. don't forget à faire bouger les fesses (aaa j'aime tellement les culs bien fendus!) Ladies only!! sorry... serioously this book isn't bad but to really be narcisistic you need to look in a mirror not a book."
2,You the owner's manual,I did not like this book it is too false. I read a lot of books along this genre and i did not enjoy it at allsorry
4,Fun way to learn about your body,The two doctors have presented human physiology in a way that it is fun to read and learn about. This alone makes the book worth reading. The food ideas they have included are a bonus.
5,Excellent book,I gained a lot of not only information but insight from this book. It very much lives up to its hype. A must read for anyone wanting to know more about their body and how to live a healthier life.
3,"A useful survey of knowledge, not in depth","A good layman's guide to a healthy lifestyle and diet, as well as common diseases and causes. Though mostare a direct result of a western diet and didactic medicine. Recommend; ""In Defense of Food""."
4,Worth its Weight in Poop,"The fact this book said pooping is great and that we need to poop often was worth the purchase price ALONE. That's something I knew all along, but it was nice having that notion confirmed by Frank Oz.However, is it really possible to make ourselves younger? This seems like false advertising. While this book may purport to reverse the effects of time (make us healthier) it can't actually reverse time, can it? I think no matter how often you read the book or follow its advice, I'm pretty sure you will still get one year older each year...does this guy think he's the Wizard of Oz?In any event this book confirms once again, the key to success is the blessing of Oprah Winfrey. It can be complete sh#t, but if she hocks it on her show, you can pretty much retire early."
3,If Only...,"'YOU: The Owner's Manual : An Insider's Guide to the Body that Will Make You Healthier and Younger' is an interesting book, but there is only one body that will make me healthier and younger. Unfortunately, Brad Pitt already owns it."
4,good and easy,This book was an easy read and yet very informative. It highlights easy and managable things to do to keep our bodies healthy as we age and was written with wonderful humor!Great Book!
5,Getting to Know Yourself or Someone You Know.,"I loved getting taken through the inside of my body in small steps even a child could follow. I feel better a understanding of topics and changes that have taken place in myself and my family has gone through after having read this book. It was also fun to take the quiz- a quick trip to back to school for some of us.I also purchased ""The Backsmart Fitness Plan"" I learned a lot about the proper way to exercise and the errors I was doing resulting in no progess in my workouts. A good pairing for anyone who wants a balanced body!"
4,"Yes, it's a good book on health and wellness, but...","As a dedicated health nut, I found the book practical and informative. It is logically organized by bodily system and written in a clear, easy to read style. I learned a number of entirely new things about health and wellness and, in other areas, the book reinforced concepts for me with greater detail or from different perspectives. On the other hand, I was less impressed by the book's nearly pervasive adolescent humor. The gratuitous jokes and innuendo added unnecessarily and often painfully to the book's length. I imagine that one or more editors mentioned this issue, only to be beaten back by the authors' insistence on artistic license."
3,Too Many Jokes!,"It's informative - but too many jokes for me.I'm not sure why as i really like Dr. Oz - but, if you can get over the constant joking - it's a pretty good book."
4,A Good Guide To Your Body And Health,Anybody concerned with their health should read this book. You are basically what you eat - so you should consider your diet very carefully. For me the most interesting part of the book is the one related with the artery clogging and blood tension. The writing style is very funny and very accessible to anyone. Recommended!
2,Tries too hard,"Initially the book is good, offering some humor and a a rather unique approach to how one can think of one's own body. But it got tired after the first 20 pages, every third line was an obligatory joke, and an analogy that reflected the author's evident affinity with modern day sitcoms. The book was honest and opinionated, but humor has an element of surprise to it and these guys rhytmn was entirely predictable and therefore annoying."
3,It's worth the information but...,"There was a lot of great information in this book but their sense of humor was about as clever as a bored teenager playing pictionary. Think that joke sucked? Me too, you'll find one just like it in every paragraph of this book."
3,Tried to be a little too funny,"I liked this book, but ended up skipping over a lot of the parts that were supposed to be funny. I would have liked the pictures to be labeled correctly, not with funny made up names for body parts."
5,The Bible of your body,"This is a great book. Very easy to read and understand, real world problems and suggestions for keeping anybodys body in the best shape possible. I will be reading it many times and highlight the areas of importance to me."
2,simple,"The author takes a annoyingly simple ""pop culture"" narrative to explain complex systems of the human body. In many instances he attempts to use humor and colorful adjectives to describe your antaomy. I found this distracting and bothersome.I think this book would be interesting for a third grader yet it might also act as a disservice in teaching this student."
4,interesting,"interesting book, fun book to flip through and apply the categories that you or someone you know might be dealing with. It is simple, easy to understand and an interesting book."
5,One super book,"This book is a great medical guide. I'll just explain the book this way: My wife kept telling me about a book she'd heard about on TV. I half listened until the day it arrived. She was telling me about the book and asked if I wanted to see it. I finally gave in and said ""Okay"". Well I, having little interest in really looking at the book, picked a topic: How to eat to lose weight. That topic was more than interesting and not the usual clamor. This lead to reading further. Two hours later my wife asked for the book back and I decided to buy my own. Our son-in-laws also received one as a gift and were told they may not be able to but it down. One in-law spent his entire vacation reading the book."
4,BOOK,"This book is just tarrific. My opinion is, that everybody should have such book at home. It gives you a comparatively deep wiev inside our organism and helps understand how it (should) works. Also included very helpful advices about foods, vitamines and a way of life to be more healthy and young"
4,Must have book!,"Great book. Everyone should get to know how their body works, and this is the place to start."
4,Great Reference Manual for Beginners,"Great reference book giving a simplified overview about how are bodies work and what we can do to optimize our health. One warning though, I tried reading this book from start to finish in a couple days. Probably not a good idea because I wasn't able to retain too much shortly after finishing the book. The book is essentially a simplified health reference book.Overall, a good buy, would recommend it."
5,Interesting book,Theres been a tremendous amount of controversy about this book and the previous one...but both pertain to the same thing...the cruel and demeaning things that this woman and others went through...it is unbelievable how the ones responsible still have the nerve to say that they are innocent when all the facts are there...I definetly believe in the author and this book and the previous one will surely convince you of the same...enjoy...
5,Beautiful dinnerware,The pictures don't do the dishes justice. They are beautiful! The gold trim on the edge gives the dishes a very elegant look. I am very happy with them
1,Does not work with Mellisa and Doug Dollhouse,Do not buy this to go with the dollhouse that Mellisa and Doug sells becuase it will not work with it at all. It is waaaaaay tooo big. Very disappointing that they would sell something that is so far out of scale for something that you would logically figure it was built to fit.
4,Our granddaughters liked the doll house furniture.,Our granddaughters needed some furniture. We got them the bedroom set and they wee very pleased. We noted that the furniture appeared to be well made and was of good quality. We are glad that we gave them this present.
5,Fantastic!,"My kids and I recently finished building a doll house and have been furnishing it slowly. Most of these sets are very expensive and I cannot justify spending that kind of money on toys. However, Melissa & Doug offer excellent prices for good quality doll furniture.This bedroom set has working drawers, doors, and fits perfectly into the bedroom. I have always loved miniatures and Melissa & Doug have exactly what is needed at a price that I can afford. My kids love playing with the doll house."
5,Adorable,"These arrived quickly and was well packaged. There was a hidden surprise in the armoire, I didn't expect to find a clothes pole. There's plenty of room in there to add doll clothes, pillows, blankets or add the miniature hangers on the clothes pole. Very nice, I do wish that the bed had removable blanket and pillow for more interactive play. I do recommend these pieces and by adding some of the miniature accessories this will be a fun addition to the Melissa & Doug Victorian Dollhouse."
2,legs came unglued first day,My daughter just opened this up from Santa today and one of the legs on the vanity mirror was broken right out of the box (where its connected with glue). Then another leg came off the dresser. My husband had to glue them back on with wood glue. It looks as if they were never glued on very good to begin with. Maybe cheap glue or cheap craftsmenship. She is enjoying playing with it though....when the glue dries.
5,CHILDRN BEDROOM FURNITURE,"THE BEST CONSTUCTION I'V SEEN FOR DOLL FURNITURE. GOOD WOOD QUALITY ALONG WITH FINISH. THE DOORS AND DRAWERS OPEN AND AND CLOSE. ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE COLOR, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS FURNITURE IN A SELECTION OF COLORS. GOOD BUY...SHIPPING WAY TOO HIGH."
1,Beautiful garbage,"I bought this for my 9 year old grand daughter for her birthday. She cleaned her room spotless to make her special day even more special when she played with her new doll furniture in her doll house for the first time. She was SO excited, she had waited for this furniture since Christmas time. What a heart breaker to have EVERY piece fall apart as she took it from the packages. I don't know if the glue was old or what, but I bought her 5 sets, over $100 worth of beautiful garbage... In order for her to keep it, her mom would have had to glue every single piece back together. The intricate pieces made this virtually impossible. So in the trash it ended up. It wasn't even fit for a doll house that was all for show and never used. Just horrible. I will NEVER by this brand again. If it had been 1 package, OK, but ALL 5?!!!"
1,Doll bed was too short for the 1 inch scale miniature dolls,"I bought this for my granddaughter and my daughter informed me that the bed was too short for the parent dolls, they have to sleep on the diagonal in order to fit."
4,Good buy!,This furniture is perfect for a kid's dollhouse. The doors open. It appears to be pretty durable and is as nice as it looks in the pictures online. It's a good buy!
5,Have to read a second time.,This book clearly provides the reasoning and history of Paul's very significant role in establishing and expanding the the Christian Church. It also provides justification and backup reasoning for the beliefs of our early Christian Church.
2,Tiny and General,"I try to get as much out of text books as I can but I found it difficult to take much from this book. For a book that has so many ""Case Vignettes"" I couldn't even find one specific intervention or even advice on how to handle the issues it raises.Here's the gist of every chapter: The school environment is difficult to navigate and a lot of different people want a lot of different things for it. Your role as a social worker in a school means that you will be assuming many roles.Seriously, keep those two lines in mind and you'll see that every chapter is just saying this in a different way without any more enlightening information."
4,Primer on Tibetan Buddhism,"We went to Tibet in 2010 and I had tried to do some reading to understand its culture which is tied closely to its religion. Yet, I was confused about what I was seeing in the holy places in Lhasa. Once home, I tried to rectify this by searching out resources about Tibetan Buddhism. I settled on this one as it seemed to be pretty basic.The book is good and organized well. But Buddhism is a complex religion and it may be beyond any book to summarize something so complicated.I would still recommend this book to someone wanting to get a grasp of the faith of the Tibetan people. But expect to read it slowly and maybe take some notes."
2,Disappointed,"Nothing special here, just some kittens and lots of cats, not much of a variety either. Could have made this myself. I guess if you are a huge crazy cat person you will love it, but I am a cat lover and it was kinda boring."
1,Cats? Wtf?,Wtf I specifically wanted kittens and there are most definitely full grown cats in this movies. That makes me sick. More like .5 stars.
3,Simple story,This is a simple story about a kitten who Kipper thinks is stuck in the tree. The kitten watches the attempted rescue and then surprises the others when it finds it's own way out. The illustrations cute and the text is very easy to read. This is a good book for very young children.
3,pump,"The product was a not perfect match must have 12 or will blow fuse. It works good, but 12 v a must. I would recommend this product to others probably.....dont stick in regular cigarate lighter."
3,"Great air, Short cord","This pump is a good value for the money. It inflates all types of items quickly. It is sort of noisy, but really no more than can be expected.BEWARE: The cord is not 10 feet long as advertised. The one I received is just short of 5 feet! I may have to buy an extension for it. Even the box it comes in says it is 10 feet. The only other complaint I have is that the different attachments for the connection are not permanently attached in some way to the unit. Overall, I would recommend this if you can be close to a power source."
3,"Works great, but no 10 ft power cord which u definitely need!!!","Bought this item to blow up rafts, it works really well & fast, but it claims to have a 10 ft power cord & I can assure you the one I received had a 5 ft cord!! The cord needs to be at least 10 ft, I would prefer 15ft because it barely reaches out of the car door!!"
5,AMAZING,"I have experience with a few pumps and this one by far has the best output out of all of them, We float the edisto river here in charleston alot and its important to get their and blow up the floats fast to be on the water before a crowd hits, this pump definetly outperforms all the others. Great price too!"
5,Great deal for the price!,Works great. Quickly inflated and deflated my air beds on my recent camping trip. The three different tips fit each of my beds. I just wish the tips were attached to the unit somehow so they don't get lost. I just put it in a ziploc to keep them both in the same place!
1,"I report, you decide","I bought a motor boat last September. At the end of last year, I started to get prepared for water tubing so I bought this air pump and a battery booster last year. Two week ago I bought a tow able water tube. Two days ago on Sunday August 23, we went to Lake George, NY for the first time we plan to do water tubing. I plugged the pump into my 12-volt battery booster and started to inflate the tube on lake. After the tube is about 70% filled. The pump stopped working normally and went in to episodes of s-l-o-w clanking noise that last about two seconds/episode with an interval of about one second between episodes. Can you imagine how disappointed the kids were? This was the first and the last time I used the pump. I threw the pump into the trash as soon as we got back to the marina. I would give it a zero star if this option is available."
2,Blows Fuzes,"Used this product and it immediately blew the 10amp fuze in my boat... I plugged in my 25 amp fuze and it worked great after I did this... however, I am unhappy that the manufacturer never says anywhere on his product that it pulls 10+ amps. Just make sure before you plug this product into your cig lighter that you have a 25 amp fuze installed in your cig lighter. I would recommend you don't buy this product though."
1,?? Don't Bother To Buy These Reference Reports,"To start off, this report was listed at three pages in length. I thought this was rather brief but thought that I could use the information it said that it would cover. Well, it turned out that the report was only 1.75 pages long. I was looking to find a list of articles that Adelle Davis had written for various magazines. The 'list' in this reference is only 5 items long. Many are left out. It looks like this company just did a cursory search online and jotted some data down. Six dollars wasted. Much better treatment on Adelle Davis on her foundation and fan sites.One Star"
3,Decent...but boring,"This is a truly decent book if your interested at all in history or economics. He really makes it easy to understand but puts a lot of stuff in there that doesn't fit. Its a good buy for about 5 bucks, other then that i wouldn't get it, unless you're interested in that sort of thing."
4,A Non-standard Micro Text,"This is an introductory textbook on microeconomics. When one reads some intro text on micro, you will find nothing new. But the stress of this book is the scientific method behind economic theories, associated with many real life examples, which are good for those who would like to learn applications. There are excellent discussions on property right and transaction cost constraints, that one may not be able to find in some other texts. But this book doesn't include indifference curve analysis, which should be one major topic in intro micro. In summary, it is not just a standard textbook."
4,Insightful tips for waging the war in which all Christians have enlisted,"I have been privileged to have had 2-3 in-depth conversations with Bishop Harry Jackson, and have the utmost respect for him. That respect is only heightened by this book, which he said is the one he is proudest of. He talks about spiritual warfare in very down-to-earth terms and offers practical, biblical approaches for waging it. Highly recommended."
4,Worth the price,this book is very well written for beginners in Italian. Each entry has a comprehensive vocabulary that is very helpful. The grammar lesson is short and easy to understand.I would recommend this book.
2,(Waterproof) Dry Camera Camera Case,"Missing one of the 2 plastic clips, so it isn't workable. Not impressed with overall Quality. Too much effort to send back for 20 cent clip."
3,"Waterprood, but cheap plastic keyfob almost cost me my camera!!","It is waterproof. However, I used it on a rafting trip and almost lost my camera as the cheap plastic lanyard attachment unhooked from the bag (which doesn't float). Luckily, it fell into the raft and did not sink to the bottom of the river! It'd use this only in not active sport situations."
1,Killed my new camera,"Works in bathroom sink, didn't worked in 3' high waves in Mexico. My brand new camera is trashed and vacation pictures must been taken on the phone camera instead. ""Thank you very much for nothing!""Now (after vacation) is to late to even return this ""great product"" and not mentioning lost of over $300 new camera .Long story short: Your product suck and you are liers!"
2,This thing is cheap. Go to Walmart Hiking section.,"It keeps stuff waterproof but I do not trust it very much, it is worth probably $.50 any more than that and you can get better bags in the hiking section of Walmart. Seriously $8.88 gets you a great hard water proof case, sure you cannot take pictures through it.......but who really takes pictures with a camera in a bag when a waterproof camera on Amazon can be had for $60?"
4,Not for under water shots,"Bought it for vacation use to Hawaii since my last camera got water damaged @ the beach. Great for taking pictures by the beach and pool and not having to worry about splashes or even falling in the water.Pros:It keeps the camera dry.CheapCons:Cannot use flash with it, so under water shots are pretty useless. Shots in the pool looks ok due to clear water and lot more light bouncing off the bottom of the pool.Bag is rubbery, so getting the camera in and out of it is not easy."
3,Not what I expected,"It is very small. It does the job I suppose but the only thing you can fit in it is a camera and you can't take pictures while it is still in the bag. The plastic top doesn't allow it to open completely so if you don't have small hands, it can be a pain to get in and out."
3,A different direction in ambient music,"Essentially this is a cd of ambient gone a bit over the top. Musically Ebeling Hughes have managed to put together a wonderful disc that allows the listener to float along. Unfortunately, there's not enough 'movement' on the album to get it out of the realm of background music (or for that matter move it beyond post-kid acid music). But one tends to think that both Bob Ebeling and Chuck Hughes don't mind this and even would advocate it. This is seen in the tracks ""butterfly"", ""daydreaming"" and ""can't you see?"". Hughes has the vocals and lyrical bent of Syd Barrett and Ebeling manages to place himself firmly in the Brian Eno tradition. While not a fantastic album it is one that allows for a quasi-nostalgic turn in ambient/ethereal music. Definitely worth a listen."
2,Buyer Beware,"Before buying, make sure you read the fine print: ""All selections are new stereo recordings."" Translation: these are NOT the original hits. They are performed by the original artists, but not the version you remember. Also note, on my copy at least, there are only 11 tracks, not 12 tracks, why? Because tracks 7 and 8 were combined on track 7. How's that for quality control!!"
1,Horrible odor,"I have been taking DIM for some time now and ordered from Source Naturals the most recent two times. In both instances the bottles arrived and, when opened, the tablets had a horribly strong odor similar to moth balls. I thought maybe the odor would disappear after a day or two but it did not. I would not dare take them."
1,Soy or no Soy?,Am a little concerned about this DIM - the Safety Info of this product states it contain soy. the product description states is contains no soy....?
2,Useful but outdated,"As any book written by an individual in acadamia,this treatise slants heavily towards ""case analysis"" and philosophical thought, I would not recommend this book for the practioner..David Robbin's text published by Michie is the better read."
5,Very nice!,"I am very impressed by this TV! I have it hooked up to my Xbox 360, and it looks great! Standard TV looks great on it as well. I have not had any problems with any buzzing from the speakers, as some people may have mentioned."
2,Bright areas are washed out,"This TV is a great value and offers a nice picture except in the bright areas where it becomes washed out. For example, an HD hockey broadcast displays the ice as completely washed out. You can barely see the lines.I tried adjusting every picture parameter but it doesn't help. In photographic terms, the picture signal could be dropped around 3 stops to be normal. I hope this is fixable because it is very annoying and completely takes me out of the viewing."
1,Never buy any products from OLEVIA!!,"Never buy any products from OLEVIA!!.. unless you want to become like me writing reviews like this at the middle of the night.. guys the price alone is not worth it!!... and dont fall for the 1 yr at home warranty... not worth the head aches dealing with the service folks!!... believe me put in the extra 600$s and go for well known brands...I got my LCD 37 inch TV replaced twice.. both the times the picture becam toooo glary to see, the original one lasted for 6 months and replaced refurbished one lasted for 2 months of use, the joke is the warranty lasts only for 1 yr no matter how may times they replace it with another refurbished one!!..The best warranty is something I never have to use, not selling sub standard products with a 1yr at home warranty to dupe the innocent buyers.!!.. Good luck!!"
1,Watch out for the warranty!,"Syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser. I got my daughter one as a gift, gave it to her bran new, in the factory sealed box and Syntax refuses to honor the warranty, (and yes I calld everywere and tried everything)."
2,You get what you pay for,"This television hasn't worked right since I got it, and support is not so great. I simply cannot get it to display in full screen. Comcast doesn't carry the id# which makes setup complete guesswork. I really might as well have bought a good 32 inch set. Well, I do get the advantage of the taller screen in 4:3 aspect, which is nice.The picture quality is fine. I have seen reviews about the clunky remote, but I don't have any problems with how it looks or feels. You do have to aim it pretty close to the bottom of the set.Right now I wish I had spent another $600."
1,"It was a nice set , until they service the warranty","Over a week ago I noticed my 9 month old Olevia LT37HVS locking up and shutting off by itself. I callled Syntax-Brillian Corporation to take advantage of the warranty, They said they would ship the parts out right away and then send a technicain over to install them. I checked back with them 3 days later and they said they would ship the parts out tommorrow.The customer service is abominable. This is my second Olevia set , such a shame because when the Olevias work its a great product at a very competetive price. I will tell you this based on my experience with the warranty in the first year, I would not by an extended warraty from Sytax , I am shopping for a third party ,one that can give me quicker service. I will edit this when my set is restored."
2,DON' T BUY!!! Very poor quality!! On my 3rd Set,I originally purchased this HDTV back in September but it had to be replaced because the digital tuner(ATSC) was defective and the ATSC would crash while i was watching digital TV so the picture would freeze and i would have to restart the TV to watch digital TV.Olevia replaced that defective tv with a new tv same model and it worked fine for about 2 months now it has an unsightly thin vertical blue line going threw the middle of the screen. So now olevia has to replace my tv for a second time in 6 months. I've never experienced such poor quality electronics in my life and I will never buy another product from olervia-syntax. I would give this product 0 stars if i could. DONT buy this (...).
1,Nothing but trouble,"I purchased the 342 model back in April.Within a month, the power went out on the TV. Numerous phone attempts to the manufacturer with extended hold times, and now in December, my TV still hasn't been repaired or replaced. The only way for me to ge the TV repaired is to send it out to a manufacturers representative, as this is apparently how the warranty works. Try getting a 42 inch TV back to a manufacturers rep, without a box to send it in.My last contact with this company was in early November, when I sent them documents for a replacement TV (with a hold put on my credit card for full purchase value), and I've still heard nothing back from this company.The product obviously is inferior, and their customer service is even worse."
1,"Looks good out of the gate, but stumbles before the finish","I have purchased 4 Olevia TV's (from 27"" to 42"") and until recently I would have recommended them to anyone. First there was slow rebates, but I was aware of that problem when I made the purchase. Then it came time for service, and my experience was the same as recent reviews. They are very nice and promise to take care of everything... DON'T BET THE FARM. Just like others have said here, they say parts will be shipped (in my case on the 3rd) then a week or two later you'll find out that parts haven't shipped, or on back order. BIG HINT: If the manufacture of a product has major components on back order, your's is not the only one broke.I've bought 4, but Olevia has got the last dollar from me and if you're smart they wouldn't get your first one. I think some retailers like Office Depot and HSN have dropped the line and just selling off stock.DO NOT BUY! You have been warned."
1,Big red flag - don't waste your money - Syntax tests at your cost,"It will work only until about one year for which there is a warranty after that it all depends on your luck. Mine stopped working at 14th month, took it to a local repair shop, low quality and unavailable parts, so repair was not possible except by Syntax. They ask for an arm and a leg to fix it on top of shipping this heavy junk, you are better off buying a well known brand with extended warranty."
5,Excellent!,"I have had the Olevia for 3 months now, and I am thrilled. The picture is great... As good as any I've seen anywhere. Better than many of the higher priced brands. I've used it with Computer, Xbox 360, DTV, etc... and it has more than enough hookups, inputs, etc.A few things:The remote is not very good. However, I don't use it much.Native VGA res is 1024x768... 4:3 on a 16:9 screen, so computer images are stretched if using Standard XP. Nero Home did the conversion for me so that DIVX movies have the proper aspect, and Media Center edition will do the same.Do yourself a favor and go through one of the ""Setup"" menus on a THX DVD. I used ""The Incredibles"". You can set your brightness and tint to THX spec, test and set up your audio, etc... Guarantees you get the best picture the way it was intended.Other than that, this is a great TV at an awesome price."
5,Excellent,"I don't think you can get better TV in this price range and it beats some TVs in higher price range as well. Very good , sharp and clear picture. Excellent when used with MCE PC as well - will accept DVI or VGA connection. Great satellite and DVD picture. Have had the TV for over a year now and works great.The only downsides are the speakers and remote (remote is like some bad 80s TV's remote). However I don't use them anyway - I use external speakers and Logitech Harmony remote, so it's really not an issue."
2,Service is very poor,Getting an Olevia fixed is nearly impossible. They have NO authorized service centers according to their tech service guy!!!! Of course I don't think he is even in the USA!!! So what else is new.
4,fresh meat to nibble on,"I realised after hearing this thing it's several years old, but you may be fooled just like me. This little ep rocks and certainly has it's own sound. The singer has his own thing going on that you might love or hate. Either way, it fits the vibe of the record. I think these tunes and production still hangs nicely even though I'm about 8 years late."
4,slave,"Tempt Not This Flesh is a story of abduction and sexual enslavement, a story of passion unleashed and unbounded. And above all it is the story of a woman's love, shattered like glass, then resurrected, rekindled by a dashing captain of dragoons. A love so powerful it is forged into a weapon that topples a dynasty."
2,Turgid!,"This book was a typical 1970s historical romance. The historical accuracy was good, but the characters were not very well-defined or sympathetic.It was hard to finish, and didn't even have much raciness in it.I would say search for your romance in greener pastures."
3,A good story about finding your place in the world.,"A Series I think has a good message hidden beneath it, but the villian is truly one heartless bastard. It's a good thing the main character is so kind-hearted and cute. Which is a strong combination against anything."
5,A hidden gem!,"This series has a humorous side that is hilarious most of the time but occasionally annoying. However, the serious side more than makes up for these shortcomings. If you are looking for a complex plot or lots of action then pass on this series. If you like an emotional, character driven story then this one is for you. Almost every episode has affirmations, tidbits of wisdom and touching scenes. And that's because the series is really about the healing process people who have suffered from tragedies, abuse, etc. go through on the road to recovery and even how to live life. This is one of those hidden little gems that, once found, sparkle so brightly in the sunlight."
5,So Cute!,"I ordered this set, it arrived 2 days later and 2 nights after that I had finished watching the entire series. It's absolutely adorable - I laughed, I cried and I was happy the whole time... I even loved the ambiguous ending!While I can appreciate complex and deep characters in animation, its sometimes refreshing to be able to sit back and just enjoy a heroine who you know is going to do the right thing all the time without much internal conflict.This Anime is cotton candy sweet...similar to Ah! My Goddess, with less fan service and more slapstick humor. Throughly enjoyable."
1,No Redeeming Features,"If you look up my other reviews you'll see I try to find something good even in the worst anime series. But it is completely impossible with this one.This thing starts with an odd proposition - that some quite attractive girl is living in a tent in the middle of nowhere and is befriended by the most popular boy in school who just happens to turn into an animal when hugged or when emotions get too high.Ok, from a poor start it just gets worse. There's no story to begin with and the writing varies from poor to rotten. I never did understand why they actually produced this but my recommendation is to stay far away from this lemon."
4,great buy,"This was such a better deal then the other box set, although you do notice where the money's been cut from. The dvd had all the episodes, and as far as I can tell, had all the special features and extras. The only difference was there were more episodes per dvd, and the packaging was much cheaper. The dvd cases had just simple covers with tiny print on the back, while the box itself was just a continual display of screen shots, with a piece of paper stuck on the back with the blurb etc on it.Other than that there was absolutely no difference, and this was clearly the cheaper and better way to go."
3,"A good children's book, but not classic Jannson.","A modest tale concerning Moomintroll's adventures mid-winter without his usual family and friends. The book features many charming illustrations by Tove Jannson, but on the whole it is not as interesting as 'Finn Family Moomintroll', or the classic 'Comet in Moominland'."
3,Great Book--Clumsy Translation,"This translation is very difficult to read out loud--and would be almost impossible for children to read on their own. Syntax is convoluted, diction is oddly stiff and formal, and the grammar isn't even always correct.Even worse (and more confusing) this translator can't seem to keep his personal pronouns straight or even write in complete sentences. Take these two consecutive sentences, for example:""I'm growing angry,"" said little My. ""When, for once, one could've had some use for a sister."" ""Once, one"" reads terribly--and the whole chunk is a fragment that messes up the rhythm of a would-be sentence. (The above quote was an entire paragraph, by the way. I haven't mislead by a partial quote.)The Moomintroll books translated by Elizabeth Portch are delightful reads. I won't buy another Warburton translation again, though, no matter how badly I want another Moomintroll adventure."
2,Not a compelling read.,"I did not enjoy the book as much as I had hoped. For all the hype around the book, I was underwhelmed by it. I thought her conclusions were flawed and were presented without any sort of context.That being said, it does offer an interesting look at the Mulroney years and those who were along for the ride."
1,"I""LL TAKE BRIAN","While Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister of Canada he endured far more unfair press than any Prime Minister in Canada's history. This book is nothing more than an extension of that press, full of unproven and false assumptions. Cameron's inferences to-wards Mr Mulroney's part in the ""Air Bus"" scandal alleging kickbacks and other malfeasance is pure journalistic ""what if."" Indeed, Brian Mulroney took the current Canadian Federal Government to task for making similar allegations. He sued them for liable. The Federal Govt. backed down and paid Mr Mulroney several million dollars plus his legal costs. No evidence has ever been found that Brian Mulroney committed any wrong doings while he was Prime Minister of Canada.Finally, there was rumour a few years ago that the author was planning a sequel to ""On the Take"".That sequel has yet to appear. I wonder why. I have given this book one star. I wish I could give it a big fat zero."
1,Harvest of Yawns,"I wasn't a Poul Anderson fan before I read this book, and I still am not. The last Anderson book I read was in the Ensign Flandry series in the late 80's which told a nice story but was nothing special. This book has an interesting idea: the downloads of the head of Fireball trying to outwit each other. The corrupted download is a pawn of the oppressive government while the other fights to maintain Fireball's independence and freedom. Too bad Anderson forgot to tell a story or build the characters along the way. Another author could have made this into a great book with this premise. The book is indeed a ponderous read as Kirkus Reviews indicates. Instead, of concentrating on developing a good storyline and dialogue, Anderson describes EVERYTHING is excruciating detail. If you want to be entertained, I would recommend that you read some of Anderson's earlier Flandry novels."
1,When will it ever end?!,"I agree with the Kirkus Review: this novel is ponderous, bloated. I marvelled at the additional layers of sentimental stuff that kept plopping into the final 50 pages; at times it read like the author's outline. There was no character change, no hard decisions. Plot developments were weighty and slow, then petered away into inconsequential issues. It was my first exposure to Poul Anderson and it'll probably be awhile before I get back."
3,"OK read, but would not read again","This novel is an OK read but not one I would specifically recommend. Too many plot details and changes, overdone descriptions... (a string of adjectives does not a sentence make!) I'll admit to wishing at times that it would just wrap up and be done with. There were some good concepts and enjoyable bits, so it wasn't a total loss, but there is much better fare in the genre."
2,Not Impressed,If you are looking for business management...okIf you are looking for ideas on baskets..forget it
4,Bioinformatic for the beginner...,"I guess that everybody interrested by this kind of book knows already a little about bioinformatic and wants to improve his bioinformatician skill. So forget about this book:This is really a well-documented introduction to all the methods currently used by every biologist or biology student, such as Blast, Clustal, multiple alignement or use of web-interface for submiting sequence.So get it if you need a clear introduction to the field, but if you already know a little bit about bioinfo, immediately choose a more detailed book."
2,Poorly organized overpriced book,"Although the book is presented as an introduction to the topic, its organization assumes that the reader has already been working in the area. Two of the chapters (1 and 17) are a waste of space. The first chapter presents a (useless) introduction to internet, while chapter 17 attempts (and fails to do so) to explain Perl in the context of bioinformatics. For the same money you can find far better books in the market. The good thing is that I only borrowed the book :)"
2,Sort of decent...,"This book is probably decent (though frustrating due to being so brief) for an introductory undergrad course, but it's not detailed enough for a graduate level course. Every time I wanted a more in-depth explanation of a subject, I'd first turn to this book. What a waste of time - I found better explanations and guides through Google!"
3,Not a very useful textbook at all,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this book is poorly organized. Actually, I would summarise this book with a single saying: TMI (Too Much Information)! In teaching you how to accomplish a simple task, the details given are tremendous, so much so that you can't see the forest from the trees and you end up having to navigate the bioinformatics Web sites by trial and error anyway. Perhaps this book would be useful for a post-doc or someone already very familiar with those sites and want to know how they work. For the student (undergrad through Master), I suggest picking up the short-n-sweet paperback 'Bioinformatics' by Westhead, Parish & Twyman instead."
2,...,"I used the Baxevanis volume in coursework at Johns Hopkins Biotechnology program...several of the chapter authors are associated with the school. There's no doubt that the editor and authors are experts in their fields, but the volume seems somewhat dated, and is disjointed. I found a couple of the chapters virtually unreadable. The real killer is the price. The book is GROSSLY overpriced......"
4,A great primer for bioinformatics.,"A great introduction to bioinformatics with links to biological databases and data mining tools. I have the edition that was written in 1998 so many of the links in the book are now inactive. The book contains good introductory summaries of the algorithms used in the data mining tools discussed. The book however is aimed more at the biologist with little computer knowledge. If you are a computer scientist, the book will be a little boring and I would recommend ""Biological Sequence Analysis"" by Durbin et al. The price of the book is steep for the amount of pages you are paying for. If price is a consideration in your purchase, I recommend the use of the tutorials on many of the bioinformatics websites such as NCBI, EBI, and Swiss-Prot which are just as good as the book."
1,Tapes are BAD--DON'T BUY,"I bought the tapes to listen to while I drive and they have more English than Korean and the dialogs are strange. The speakers' accents unclear. There is information that I've never heard Koreans speak of.The cultural ""information"" given is outdated by at least 8 years.I read the first book years ago and know it well.I bought this one for the tapes.50% of the dialogs are done again for ""practice"".This is completely different from Spanish tapes I bought and also the ones I used at the university"
1,Appalling: how dare you? This book is shameful.,"This book is a blatant attempt to benefit from the deaths of those who passed in 9/11 events.As one personally touched by this tragedy, I am outraged.And I AM going to let people know about this book--others who will share in my outrage.How dare you?This is self-published--meaning, no publisher considered it worthy.Nor do I. Do not encourage this person by buying this book."
4,Usefull,"These are very useful to me. There is not a lot of variety in shape or size, I think there are 3 of one shape and 4 of the other, but they are easily sharpened, and after I made a little handle to insert them in, they work great. I think they are stainless steel. I use them for removing excess glue from projects after it has dried, and am very happy with them. They also work well for small carving projects. Good buy."
5,Good Product,"It is a good product, came on time, works well, fits nicely, matches my decor, functions properly and came on time."
