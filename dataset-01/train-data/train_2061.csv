3,Same ole story,"This game was a blast with the way the battles were actually played. Having to draw certain combinations of runes quickly and accurately was challenging, but not nearly as rough as remembering which combinations did what. I feel this is a great and innovative battle system. Unfortunately, all that joy was crushed as the story is the same boring story, and the game was very linear, it basically hand walked you through the story and you got to fight a bit along the way. Ultimately it was a good game, one that i'll be playing again, just for the battles."
1,One of THE worst games ever made,"I got this game expecting it to be interesting, the description sounded interesting enough. But playing it... ugh. It's got to be one of the worst games ever made. The process of writing the runes takes so long and all the while whatever you fighting is still moving. The character moves very slowly so even in the part where they told you to outrun the enemy, it's not possible. So you stand and fight except then you run out of magic. So you have to sit and wait for it to charge all the while waiting being smacked down by the bad guys and then when your finally charged, you have to go back to writing more runes, again while the bad guys are smacking you around. Needless to say, your not going to survive for long.This game is horrible. It's so horrible I actually offered to give it to two separate friends after lending it to them and they both said 'No way in he**'. I strongly recommend avoiding."
3,FLAT,"This games was very different its a mix of RPG RTS and pokemon.The controls with the pen were a bit hard at first but becamekind of fun, the story is predictable and sterio type. Over alla 3/5."
2,Incorrect Information,"For a biography on such a prevalent, well known author I would have thought that the information included in the DVD would be correct. I am a pre-service teacher and showed this to my class, in the opening picture the dates listed below Poe's picture were 1804-1849. The video then went on to quote Poe's correct birth year in the opening scene, however I had to explain to my students that I had shown them a video with incorrect information. I had planned on buying all of the biography video's I would need from this series because they run 30 minutes which is absolutely perfect with a normal high school classroom's schedule. Needless to say, I won't be buying any more from this series."
3,Good reading let down by poor intonation,"I bought this recording more as a fan of the Living Stereo series rather than as a Dvorak or Piatigorsky one, but liking the piece & having heard great things about the 'cellist it seemed like a good idea.Unfortunately, although the recording is typically Living Stereoesque - full, warm & with excellent detail & presence - Piatigorsky's playing had too many mistakes in it, especially with regard to intonation, for it to be comfortable listening. It sounded like the playing of someone who was once great but who had now got a little too old, like Horowitz in his late 70s, so I was somewhat surprised to note that Piatigorsky was still in his 50s when he recorded this.Apart from the cringe-worthy tuning there was also some dodgy ensemble between soloist & orchestra - it just seemed a little sloppy.Certainly not the best recording ever - I'm not sure what is, but I'd have no hesitation in recommending Raphael Wallfisch's recording on Chandos."
4,wishing for more,"To bad there is no way to attach the video player to the case, the player slides around on the nylon material the case is made from. A bit more storage would be nice to there is some room , but if you have a couple power adaptors and headphones , maybe an additional connection wire or 2 and yourun out of room real quick."
5,Satisfied,What can I say? I was truly happy when I received this case. It is everything I wanted. Long story short it's purfect.You can't go wrong with this case.Good price too.
3,dvd carrier,this is okay. it doesnt have alot of extra room for extra plugs or headphones but it is adequate
2,It's just ok...,"I was a bit disappointed with this case. The case I have that came free with another portable DVD player we purchased several years ago has much more padding. I feel like if my player were dropped while in this case, there wouldn't be much protection for it. Also, there is no pocket that works for the cables. We just have to cram them in with the DVD player, which makes it oddly misshapen and hard to zip closed. I would not purchase this case again."
4,Granddaughter loves it!,The children like it. The screen is the perfect size and the resolution is great. I did not like the location of the volume controls. They are located on the upper right side of the player and a slight upward move of little hands changes the volume dramatically.
5,performed as expected,"Overall, I am very happy with this product. The only thing I didn't like was that the sound volume needed to be higher as I was watching old tv programs, from the 50's, and the sound needed to be very loud to hear it. I checked many other DVD players and decided on this one. I'm glad I did."
3,Average,"I give this product 3 stars because I'm not really happy with it. The only acceptable feature is the disc pocket. Other than that, you can't find a well fitted roomy slot to store all the cables. One side is the disc pocket, the other side is a flat pocket with no flap covering the open, which is open for water to get in easily. I have the Panasonic 8.5"", this case doesn't fit nicely as I wanted."
2,Bare bones case - look elsewhere,"I would advise against buying this case. It does not have any strap system to hold in the dvd player so you can safely watch the unit from inside the case. As others have written, there are no pockets to hold cables and there are only small outside openings - one for the disc holder and another for...? Maybe a plane ticket? For the price - which is not much - you seem to get just a basic black bag. Just not enough to protect the unit and hold the gear that goes with it. There is an earphone jack intended to allow easy access for in-case listening, but this is really a non-needed feature as you have to plug into one of the jacks anyway and you save maybe 2 inches of headphone cable? I'm sending this one back."
4,Handy bag,"I am very happy with this DVD tote, except for the fact that there really isn't enough room to fit the AC/DC adapter."
4,A normal girl's life?,"This tape is the beginning of the second season of Sailor Moon. All of the girls are suffering from amnesia and cant remember who they are. In the middle of what Serena wanted in the past, a normal girl's life, a new foe appears in the guise of other students and the girls must awaken to face the enemy."
1,Im Usagi Chans Number1 Fan,hi im not a fan of the dic episode. So go out and buy Sailor Moon Season2 boxset on DVD. If you buy that you get to see the real Sailor Moon. .So if you don't like dic dubbed episodes like me go out and buy season2 uncut on DVD.
3,The Return episode,"It is a little confusing the first minutes. Didn't the scouts die last episode, at the North Pole? They did and was revived, to fight another day. This time against the ""Doom Tree"" and it's caretakers Ann and Alan.A new hero appears to further the confusion. And why doesn't Mamoru/Darien regain his memories when the others do?Well, it is a quite ordinary, average SM tape of the adapted US edition.Go for the subtitled uncut editions if you can. That's my advice."
4,Stone Mortar and Pestle,"We use this mainly to crush medicine for my elderly mother in law. She cannot swallow pills of any size. After wearing out some of the plastic pill crushers, we decided to get something that will last. We succeeded! It looks very nice and works perfect for our needs. We are adding a piece of felt on the bottom, as it could scratch the countertop. Other than that, it is perfect."
5,Great gift for my mom!,"I got this for my mom for her birthday. She is ecstatic! She has always wanted a mortar and pestle, especially a granite one. She loves how heavy and durable it is, and it arrived at her house in perfect condition (no chips or broken mortar like I read on reviews of similar items). She's only used it once so far after seasoning it, but she said it worked really well, and it looks good in her kitchen too."
4,good morter & pestle,"Is bigger and heavier than you think, its works great. Be sure you really need one this big before you order."
5,A simple and yet revolutionary tool!,"I bought this because it was cheaper than I expected, and it seemed like it would be something interesting and occasionally useful to have in the kitchen. Now I'm using it all the time! I grind spices for Indian cooking, garlic for almost anything, and I've even used this to grind coffee beans. The granite is incredibly sturdy and easy to clean. A bit of soap and water will quickly take off any residue, and then the water dries almost instantly from the surface of the stone. You can also grind things very quickly with this... in just a few seconds, whatever you put in the mortar will be nicely pulverized.Overall I would say this is a surprisingly useful kitchen tool that almost replaces a food processor, and which will otherwise pleasantly ornament your counter."
5,WOW! I Actually Use This Thing,Been wanting a morter/pestle for a while.Bought this and I can't believe how many uses it has.Think of it as a dry food processor.This unit is rock solid and has plenty of capicity.
5,lives up to high expectations,"I had purchased a mexican molcajete before this and tried to season it for some time - without any success.I read online about thai mortar and pestles and saw some of the reviews and convinced myself to buy this particular one - I am really glad I did!It arrived in perfect condition and I could use it right away. It even looks really good just sitting on the counter top!It made really quick work of grinding thing like cardamom seeds, etc. I would recommend this to any and every one."
5,Wow works way better than our old one,"We had a marble Mortar and Pestle, quite a bit smaller we used often. Well it fell on the ground one day and part of it broke so I decided to get a new one. So far I've only used it to break up some egg shells but wow they just turned to mush, this thing works way better than our old one. This big size is really nice also. Shipping was quick and I have 0 complaints about this."
5,B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!,"OMG! I am so impressed with this item! First, it is B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L! Which is a good thing because it is also large (I got the 2+ cup version). It will be perfect for freshly grinding my spices, as well as making pesto and a number of other items. I am very happy with the purchase. Shipping cost almost half the actual purchase price, but it really is an item that will last a lifetime."
4,Nice piece of granite,My husband liked it! It will need to be seasoned before use to have a consistant color. He collects things that would have been used in the 18th century.
5,High Quality & Great Size,This mortar & pestle is ideal for my needs - perfect for crushing soft foods & dried herbs alike. My garlic intake has probably doubled. The set is obviously well made and is the perfect size for a variety of crushing tasks.
5,Great Purchase!,"I looked at alot of websites for the perfect mortar and pestle and finally found what I was looking for! This is perfect, works great, and looks great on my counter....HIGHLY recommend!!!!!"
5,stone granite,"I brought this for my mom, because my mom really liked it and she wanted to get it, so i got it for her, the package was well done, although it was quite of bit little too heavy but the shipment was fast!, it really came on time by usps so hail to the shipper other than no issues although i did thought that the stone that you grind on was little small but then again maybe it was just me, overall i would recommend you buy it if you planning to do one."
5,"Beautiful, and it works!",I purchased this item as a gift for my roommate. I acquired her favorite salsa recipe and wanted to give her a means for grinding the peppers. This is awesome!When it arrived I was just pleased with how beautiful it is. We leave it out on the counter just to show it off. It also is large enough for a lot of peppers and grinds them perfectly.[...]
4,Heavy Duty,It is great for any type of grinding of spices but not to great to use on nuts - it mashes them more than breaking them up into pieces.
5,Great Buy,Very heavy and substantial. Have found that I can use less ripe avocados for guacamole since the pestle is so heavy.
5,We love this,"Perfect! This is beautiful, functional, looks fabulous in any kitchen. We just love it and see it lasting for generations like our grandfather's. I can't say enough about it, it's perfect. Exactly what I was looking for with a great price and arrived in a timely manner looking great! Thank you!"
4,Great Asian Kitchen Tool,"Being raised in Burma my mother used it all the time . This is a ""must have "" basic house ware for all Asian kitchens. Basic Burmese dishes use onions,garlic and dried chilli pounded in stone mortar to get the best infusion in our dishes. Finally, I got one for cooking authentic Burmese and Asian dishes. I like this stone mortar and was made just like from Burma. I was also told that the stone came from area close Burma."
5,"Stone (Granite) Mortar and Pestle, 8 In, 3+ Cup Capacity",FANTASTIC ITEM. VERY HEAVY WILL MASH AND GRIND ALOT FOR IT IS LARGE. A VERY GOOD VALUE. THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER GOOD PRODUCT.
4,Nice solid product,"I almost bought the 3 cup but chose 2 cup based on reviews that item is larger than appears. The one I received was actually smaller than dimensions listed, but it is a nice product. Hindsight I would get the 3 cup for the wider inner diameter for ease of use. I think its luck of the draw whether you get larger or smaller than described, so don't let that deter you from getting two cup if that is what you want. Weight wasn't an issue since I expected it to be heavy. Weighs around 10-11 pounds. Haven't used it yet, so will update review when I do."
4,The 1.5+ cup mortar was plenty big,I ordered the smallest (1.5+ cup) mortar and pestle and was glad I hadn't opted for any bigger... it was huge. This seems like a solid hunk of rock that will last for a long time. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a permanent fixture in their kitchen for some serious mashing and grinding.
4,easy to use,"I used it to make the best guacamole. Grinding the serrano peppers and cilantro releases more of their essential oils, creating a wonderful flavor. It's so easy to use, I find myself using it instead of the coffee grinder or food processor to grind spices and nuts. It looks nice sitting out on the kitchen counter - which makes it even handier to use."
2,Unstable and awkward to use,"I can't believe the glowing reviews for this product. I've had mine for a couple of years and the only real use it's been is to collect coins and other odds and ends on my countertop. In fact, I'm only coming to this page to see how much I can sell it for on Craigslist and get it out of my kitchen!I *wanted* to love it, probably would love, except the base is so uneven (authentic, I guess!) that I certainly can't work with it directly on my granite countertops or they would be ruined. Even placing it on a folded kitchen towel (or potholder or rubber mat) doesn't fully stabilize the thing. It's heavy and appears good quality everywhere else (the only reason it's getting two stars), but if I can only ever use it as a paperweight, then it's absolutely useless."
5,Heavy duty pestle and mortar!,I haven't seasoned or used this item yet however it is very heavy duty and appears to be a great product.
1,POWDERY RESIDUE ON THE INSIDE,"I cannot recommend this. The granite on the inside is unfinished and has a powdery residue, likely the stone. If you are grinding dry items, it should be ok. If you try to grind moist items such as garlic or onion, it would definitely get trapped in this. It also poses a risk for someone with food allergies since it cannot be properly cleaned. Also, this is a beast! It would be very difficult to pick up to move and clean.I would go with a marble mortar and pestle vs. granite."
5,Huge...stone Mortar & Pestle,Our last Mortar and Pestle was dropped and the Pestle broke. I don't think that we will have that problem again. This thing is huge and very durable. It also looks attractive on the kitchen countertop. I just Love it. I would recommend!
4,"Works great, looks great, just needs a little work on the base.","We recieved the product in good order and with out damage. there is a little unevenness in the bottum of the product that i think a little extra mfg effort could fix, but at least they sent a note along with the set recommending the it be set on a towel in order to insure stability and not scratch the counter surface.A little grinding and piece of felt would make this product outstanding."
3,Mortar & Pestle,"beautiful set, great price. VERY heavy. we use it less that we anticipated, due to its weight."
4,Great for Under water!!,"Bought this lens as a substitute for the URPRo CY filter to use for underwater video. I don't have any direct comparisons, but I will say that with ambient sunlight at 20-30 feet of water this lens performed well. The reds are red, the yellows are yellow (as opposed to a pale cream color). The URPro CY filter runs over $70 so this is a better buy. Plus, you can do a little color correction in post if needed, but it will put you that much closer to true colors. I bought the 55mm because it fit the GoPro flat lens mod from Snake River prototyping."
3,"Good, but dated","I have real mixed feelings about this book.I did not check the pub date on this book before purchasing it. If I had, I probably wouldn't have bought it, because it is now several years old -- as in, out of date. For example, there is no mention of VirtualMin.Still, there is a lot of good basic information here, so I will get some good use out of it.When you spend this much for a technical book of this nature, you expect that you are paying for up-to-date information, rather than a ""collectable"" on the way things used to be."
2,Worked for about 3 weeks,"PROS-- 3 prong male plug connects to power outlet-- 3 prong female outlet connects to tool, fan, other motor-- 3 position rocker switch allows you to choose between OFF, FULL, and variable speed-- Dial allows you to adjust variable speed setting from slow to fastCONS-- 3 week lifespan with limited use, indoors"
3,Didn't work for my Fan,This didn't work for myLEDwholesalers GYO2402 6-Inch 240 CFM Air Duct Inline Hydroponic Booster Fanbut that's ok works for a lot of other things.
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this for an old Dremel tool that does not have variable speed control. With this speed controller, I still had an old Dremel without variable speed control. It simply did not work. Thank goodness for Amazon. I returned the item the very next day without a fuss. I do not recommend this item. I was able to solve my problem using a sewing machine foot pedal that actually worked 100 times better than this product."
4,"Good price, good product","Good price for a good item. WAs shipped fast. Seems to work very well, allows my infinite adjustable fan speed. Half speed has been about perfect for my use."
5,Equipment Cabinet Solution,"I'm using this unit to control the speed of a four fan array in an APC NetShelter computer equipment cabinet. The fan tray is installed in the roof of the cabinet, and the fans are all 120VAC. At full speed, they were much too noisy for the area where the cabinet is located. With this speed controller I get less cooling capacity, but less noise too. I've had it installed for about 3 weeks."
1,Variable speed breaks after short time,"This is my 2nd one of these speed controllers. The first one worked fine for about 5 months, then only powered the fan on max setting. Anything less than max makes the fan hum quietly but not turn. This new one that I've had for a week, lasted about three days before starting the same thing. Don't buy this, spend the extra 30 bones and get a quality fan speed controller."
1,Scam!,I should have read the reviews before I ordered. I recieved two units that didnt function properly. The variable speed does not work. See reviews with similar problem.
1,variable speed motor switch,This product did not do what I expected. This product did not regulate the speed on my grinder motor as I had hoped.
4,As advertised,Product came fast and in working order. Very easy to use. Would recommend this product to others. Good product for the price and good seller.
2,4 bought 3 dead,"I've had about 4 of these speed controllers, 3 of which died. The variable speed modes no longer work, instead it runs at full power. Since they all died the same way, 2 stars."
2,rating for speed controller,I wanted a motor control switch and this says it is a fan control switch. It works well on full power but does not seem to work well at low speed. The motor heats up when using this device it at low speeds.
3,Not what you would expect.,"Product is actually for motors with brushes. I bought to use with inline fan. It will function to adjust RPM, however the dial at 1 point is go go and beyond that it fails to be consistent. At a certain point on the dial it is not effective at maintaining the RPM. I think it will work great with router and similar tools but not ideal for fan motors."
1,Bummer,"This product is a bummer. I've had two of them die in 6 months. I suggest the slightly more expensive, Activeair fan controller."
4,It works and I did not find the hum loud at all,"Hello, I use this controller for a 6 inch fan inside one of my rooms and when its switched to half speed it is not even a bother when your in the same room.It works just for what it was needed for, a 6 inch fan with over 400 cfm is terribly loud.There was a slight hum but not bad at all."
2,Careful!,"The online information by which one makes a choice is woefully inadequate. After you buy it, the instructions tell you to test its compatibility with the motor you want to control. Well, it wasn't compatible with my inline duct fan motor, apparently because the motor is too small, and I'm sending it back.More information, such as detailed specifications, should be available to the purchaser, before purchase."
3,Not made very well,"I bought this product for my son's football themed bedroom and unfortunately it is not made very well. You are supposed to make sure the one foot mark on the chart lines up to one foot from the floor, but when you do this the actual one foot mark is way off from the chart by a few inches .... meaning we had to cut off the bottom ZONE portion of the chart and a few of the ""field markers."" So it actually doesn't end up looking like the chart pictured. Everything else is fine ... it sticks well and is very cute. I was just upset we had to cut so much of the bottom off."
1,Poor,The chart came all wrinkled because of the packaging and when I put it up it tore. Waste of money.
1,poor design,"The design is thoughtless - if you want to put it on the wall to accurately measure height, you have to cut off the bottom ""Zone"" portion."
2,Doesn't stick to textured walls,"Positives: Great color, easy to peel and stickCons: Hard to figure out where to start the chart on the wall, so the measurements are accurate. Definitely a 2 person job. Doesn't stick to textured walls."
2,Didn't stay stuck on at 50mph,"When I put it on with the enclosed double-stick tape and drove down the road 1/2 mile at 50 mph, it immediately pulled off completely. I was lucky to rescue it in the roadway. Now I have the yucky time-consuming job of having to scrape off all that useless tape and residue from both my truck and the shade, and then finding a better double stick tape to use. So if you get this, DO NOT use the tape that comes with it. Save yourself a big headache by investing a couple more bucks in good tape."
4,Way better than putting holes in your walls.,"I have plaster walls. Even when I had those drywall sheet walls, I still didn't want to fill them up with holes. So I dangle from these. They look a little cluttered along the moulding. They cast shadows. But, it's that old Victorian look and it is better than holes in the walls."
3,"Fine hooks, if they fit","These are much smaller than I anticipated. They seem designed to hook over picture moulding that has a top bead of no more than 1/2"" diameter - 3/8"" would be more secure. My molding is larger than that, so I have had to modify (read: reshape, hammer, bend) the pieces to make them work. I'm sure they would be fine if they fit your particular architecture. My 3-star rating reflects the lack of sizing information in the description of the hooks.The actual dimensions of a single piece are: 1 1/2"" high by 3/4"" deep. The metal strip itself is 1/2"" wide.By the way, for this listing (Hillman Fastener Corp 122246 Moulding Hooks (Pack of 10)) you actually get ten packages of 4 hooks each, for a total of forty hooks."
3,Divided trail,"I was close to giving this book a more favorable review. But, I am not sure if it was a formatting issue or a lack of editing that caused the numerous spelling/gramatical errors along the way. I find that annoying. It's probably an omen that you spend your honeymoon hiking from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail. Honeymooning in a tent? I think not. We learn from the get go that the author's marriage to his Spanish wife Cristina is doomed and ends in divorce and can't help thinking that he is hiking toward a divorce lawyer's office. Cristina makes it part way but is hobbled by foot injuries and must quit. The author continues on solo. The book is best when describing the hike, which succeeds, as opposed to the marriage, which doesn't. A good editor would have made this a much more enjoyable read, yet I bought the author's second book on hiking the Continental Divide Trail. Hopefully, the spelling and grammar will be better."
2,BEWARE OF THE REVIEW SCAM!!!!,Notice how these 5-star reviews are from reviewers who have reviewed nothing else. They are clearly involved with the film production and are just marketing their crap low-budget movie. It is a regular occurence here with these college-level movies. A film like this would NEVER be given 5 stars no matter how lenient the critical eye. It's low budget garbage with a good dose of T & A thrown in for sales. Wake up people!!! You have been warned!!!
4,Nice quality,I like the wrist guards. They don't fit under my gloves or mittons so I have to go buy larger ones when I use the wrist guards.
2,bar + stitching in back is uncomfortable,"Pros:* The material construction is of good quality.* Good protection with supports in front and back of wrists.Cons:* Kind of bulky.* The metal bar for the back of the wrist is very uncomfortable for my wrists. For some reason they designed it so the stitching here is very thick and uneven, so juts into the back of your wrist. I'm not sure why this surface which is intended to contact the back of the wrist isn't smooth.Unfortunately, these wrist guards are uncomfortable enough that I'm going to have to return them. :("
2,Not so good if you are wearing under snow gloves,"So I got these to snowboard with and they are just too bulky to wear under my gloves. Also they are uncomfortable to wear period, I got the largest size and they are too small. Recap: Too bulky for snow sports, too small for above average sized people (I'm 6'4"" 240lbs)"
3,TSG Black Wrist Guard (Small),"I bought them for snowboarding, but the wrist guards were too bulky when I put them on, so I couldn't wear them under my gloves. I think they'd work pretty well had they fit, but the material was a little rough on the back of the hands though."
2,Not cool with gloves,"These didnt fit under my snowboarding gloves so they had to go back. I had size M guards in Large mittens and it was still a no go. Theres one curved plastic splint on the bottom and velcro straps that go around the arm, the combo was just too bulky"
5,book review,"Excellent transaction ! Book was in perfect condition and was shipped very very fast received it in a matter of only a couple days,"
5,Amazing Hummingbird Pin!,"I bought this pin for my mom for mother's day. She loves hummingbirds and I was trying to find something special for her. When she opened it, she cried. She loved it! It was absolutely beautiful and looked even better that on the website. (That rarely happens!)"
5,Fascinating book,"The book provides a fascinating description on the birth and history of human languages. On top of the bare facts, the writer's remarkable teaching and story telling talents capture the reader. Anecdotes and facts are combined perfectly and the book is easily readable without compromising intelligence.It left me hungry for many other linguistics books, hoping they would stand up to this level of interest."
3,I wish I can give half ratings here because,"then I'll give this one 3 and a half stars. This book is intriguing and compelling. It's a tale of obsession and the darker side of love which isn't really rosy or pretty. However I never really understand the character well. Why they even fall in love isn't really made clear, despite several exciting daring-do flashbacks.If you want to read something original, this is for you. It's not perfect, but it's good enough. Dark but with enough funny moments to balance things up. Also, ignore the back blurb. They made it sound so bickerish-like, they might as well stamp BIG MISUNDERSTANDING GALORE in red across the back. But no, this book has no Big Misunderstandings, only two wounded people trying to love."
2,A Strong Female is the Only Redeaming Quality of this Book,"I found this book to be a bore. The first 100 pages just confused me. This book should have started off with the a brief history of how Sherrie and Jack met. Instead you are totally thrown of course by Sherrie's vivid dreams. It just went down hill from there. I did not find this book strong in any way except for the fact that Minerva and her mother had to have been the most unconventional women. They didn't really seem to fit in with the time peroid. I could have beileved in them if they were from today's world, but back then......I don't think so. Well, I am may be the only one who didn't like this book, so give it a shot and decide for yourself.Happy reading...."
2,Disappointing!,I had such high expectations of this book because of the raving reviews. I was bitterly disappointed. The plot is okay but the writing style is not. It becme so boring that I could hardly finish it.
1,Biggest Piece of Junk I've Had,"I have to say, out of all of the purchases I have made on Amazon, this has been the worst. The independent Amazon seller who sold this to me was great in regards to shipping it to me at a blazing fast speed. The product, however, was just plain bad.I opened up the packaging and took out the mount. Then I set it up using the directions and equipment provided.When I mounted the monitor and placed it into position, which I have to admit was very difficult, I let it go. The stand seemed like it couldn't hold my 17"" monitor - the monitor dropped onto my desk, as the arm failed to hold it.I have to admit, for $16, this was kind of expected. I'd pay three times this price for a mount that actually works - and will most likely end up doing so."
4,First Album After a 3-Year Hiatus,"This is Zafra Negra's first cd since 1997 with ""Con El Machete En La Mano"". The group sounds refreshed under July Heredia who has been in the group the longest. After going with the departure of Ronny Soler and other members and the death of another it seems that we would never hear from them again. The disc contains 11 songs, 10 merengues and 1 bachata. Some songs are upbeat but there are some sleepy songs too; 3 and 5, which are also included in the later album ""Juntos De Nuevo"" and album were Ronny Soler returns and takes the lead vocals for 5 songs. The best songs for this album are 1 and 10."
2,Not my favorite series,"I thought this was a cute idea but the books themselves are kind of boring. My 2-year-old doesn't even play with them as vehicles. The wheels get in the way on the bookshelf and the velcro holding them closed is a pain when you are looking at the book itself. Cute concept, but you're better off with some of the other great truck books out there that have a wider variety of pictures as well as some words."
3,Adorable Fire Engine with Wheels,"Small children will really enjoy this book. It is also a toy. It contains pictures of a fire engine, fire chief's car, turntable ladder engine, airport fire engines, fire rescue truck, sky-lift engine and a water tender engine.The pages are durable and there is a fastner to keep the book closed when it is used as a toy.Not for children under 3."
4,"Yes, it's really ballet music - a la Balanchine","If you've ever seen Balanchine's rapid-fire Stars & Stripes ballet, you'll recognize this stirring version of Sousa's music. Devotees of the movie Center Stage will remember Ethan Steifel working up a sweat during his Stars & Stripes solo - it's a very demanding role. (The DVD has a bonus track so you can see a little more of the choreography).I'm less familiar with Cakewalk and Interplay, but the Hoedown from Rodeo (Agnes de Mille's choreography) is included as are three pieces from Fancy Free (Jerome Robbins). So in spite of the Fourth of July packaging, this is really a terrific album for a ballet lover."
5,The Boston Pops & Arthur Fiedler,"A very good performance by The Boston Pops and its Conductor Arthur Fiedler, the pieces here played, in special those composed or arranged by Hershy Kay, are very beautiful. I enjoyed it a lot"
4,Stars and Stripes,The Boston Pops never sounded better..All five ballet works beautifully scored and lead by Arthur Fiedler with Balanchines choreography for 'Stars and Stripes' a memorable event.
5,very sweet and haunting,"Isobel,cellist/vocalist for Belle and Sebastian,steps off the ship a bit for her 2nd solo album and it sure is good-not that B and S aren't,but still-but that really is no surprise,huh?Great voice,great songs,and super good lyrics,not to mention gorgeous music.Lotsa strings and some horns fill the songs with such beauty.Very 60s-ish,and that's alright."
2,"B&S, without the S!","So this album sounds like Belle and Sebastien, that you could have guessed from the singer's bio and the fashionably Smiths-esque cover art.I don't think it's as good. In fact, I gave it a low rating for disappointing me badly. Here's what's similar: a delicate, candylike pop vocalist and cute melodic line throughout.Here's what's missing: the loud part. Many of B&S's best tracks feature rich instrumentation (strings, horns) that builds intensity and energy as the song goes along. My favorite example is track 2 of the green album.The verdict, then, is negative. It's derivative! Go buy _Strangeways Here We Come_."
4,Strategy explained like never before!,Its a truly good textbook. It is short and precise. Its contents do not solely focus on the classic school of strategy thinking but rather the focus is put on a comparison between the classic and 3 other schools of strategic thought. The short examples from real life which are used throughout the book give a better understanding of the concepts discussed.
1,not sharp at all,Round and does nothing. Every other scuffle hoe I see online is sharp. Why in the world would you have to sharpen it yourself? And with no instructions to do so. Don't buy this. (my toddler was carrying it with no worries as it was as dull as a kids toy)
1,Junk from China,Not worth the money or the wait (8+days) for delivery. The hoe does not have teeth or a sharp working edge. Rather the edge is polymer coated flimsily and as a result will not cut any unwanted vegetation. Just another piece of junkfrom China.
1,Sharp???,"I don't know if I'm supposed to sharpen it before use, but there is NO edge on it at all - it didn't cut ANYTHING! The description said it was sharp on both sides, but it's a soft edge...? Didn't work at all."
5,Another Accomplished Work,"I had throughly enjoyed Siddhartha Deb's first book: Point of No Return, but since it was during the period that I was reading a whole cluster of Indian authors I wasn't sure what my response to his second book would be. Having just finished his latest book, I can say, unequivocally, that this is a wonderful writer! with a very distinguished and impressive style. I really felt that I was with the narrator Amrit as he travels the Northeastern border of India in his quest to uncover the story of the woman in the photograph. I had the pleasure of hearing Deb read from his first book awhile back and recently heard him on NPR discussing his research and goals with this latest book and can heartily recommend it and feel quite confident that you will not only enjoy it but agree with me that we are reading someone who will become an importnat writer of our times."
4,Brings back memories,Miles was my climax for years on the Nothe Sea Jazz festival. He was the only one who could get a perfect sound in the hall.(with two stages) The atmosphere on the DVD is the same as I saw him live. One minor on the DVD is the interruption of some fine tunes with short interviews with Miles. For the rest...buy it.
3,Nothing special,"It has shrunk a bit in the wash, but the biggest thing is that the tag is REALLY irritating. Makes the back of your neck itch constantly. So, out came the scissors. Much better now."
5,"Great price, great quality","I got a few of these really really cheap....then all the sizes were sold out....except small. Really good quality ....if they get more, I will definately buy a few more."
2,Four dimensions of the Big 5,"The authors present their personality typology as being based on the ""classic"" four personality types (or temperaments).However, if you compare their ""typology"" with the standard definitions of the five factor model, the correlations are pretty obvious:North = ExtraversionWest = Openness to ExperienceSouth = AgreeablenessEast = Conscientiousness(Note that the Neuroticism domain is not covered).For me, this rules out the fact that you are one type, or maybe a combination of two, because Big5 says we have ALL FIVE domains present in our personality.If you ever have taken a Big5 test (like for instance the NEO-PI-R), then this book might be useful to get another set of descriptions of four of the five domains."
2,Wow that was rough,"Only 25 minutes and really bad. The actual climbing was pretty good and for the 80s I'm guessing it was cutting edge but watching Johnny top-rope hard climbs he once led is not that exciting, then to hear him ramble on somewhat incoherently between shots was rough.+1 Star for much of the climbing being done in spandex though."
3,To short for its own good,The Book suffers lack of detail on Charlie Chaplin's movies. The book does not really have that much text to read.The only thing there is is pictures
5,"Aaahhh, what an escape...","Needless to say, as a mother of three, I don't have a lot of time to read. This book however, only took me one day. It was even better then my last trip to Scotland,which was, two weeks ago. Terri Brisbin is a master short storyteller. Her characters are thoroughly three deminsional. You've cemented in me, a great fan, Terri! Cheers and I can't wait for the next Highland love story."
5,Tired of counting on the Good Ole Boys?,"You need this candid, no-nonsense financial survival tool if you have concerns about your financial future but keep getting ""Oh, now Dear, you don't need to concern yourself with all that complicated financial stuff"" from the Good Ole Boys. Annino's book, written in a candid, no-nonsense style, is a practical tool you can put to work right now; not just another financial book filled with legalese and fluff. You will get the sense that she actually cares about her clients, who serve as examples in the book - and you. And that's a good thing!"
4,"Great show, quality of videography could be better ...","The packaging is great and the music obviously excellent, but not sure why they would have gone through the trouble of producing a ""Limited Edition DVD"" and not filmed in in high def?"
5,Character Building Review,This book is an excellent guide in provoking thought in my child. The stories target areas that encourage openness and reveal to me what she really feels. It provides opportunities to correct and guide her in what is spriritually right and wrong.
3,I much prefer non-fictional stories.,"I much prefer non-fictional stories that focus on character building. Stories from Chicken Soup such as:- Chicken Soup for the Child's Soul: Character-Building Stories to Read with Kids Ages 5 through 8or- Chicken Soup for the Kid's Soul 2: Read Aloud or Read Alone Character-Building Stories for Kids Ages 6-10Moreover, you can go to virtuesproject.com, get their list of virtues with definition, then explore each virtues with children by having them tell their experiences of living the virtues or their witness to such virtues. Last but not least, ask children what kind of person do they want to be, to become and ties them with these characters/virtues."
5,Magnificent Recording,"One learns why a CD such as this is listed as ""an essential."" The quality of the recording is so well balanced.The Saint-Saens Organ Symphony is magnificent. The organ is delicately used in all its majesty and capabilities. It swells and then withdraws behind the orchestra only to swell again above it.Debussey's LaMer is wonderful sounds, roaring and thundering and then backing off into tranquility shimmering. I guess I'm hooked on water music, as this and Smetana's Moldau are among my favorites.I so appreciate those who recommed this as an essential. It certainly has become that in my collection."
1,Poor sound quality,"Avoid this 1993 CD edition; sound quality is very low, it lacks trebles and the beginning of the Maestoso (IV) is full of distortion. A better edition of the same material is the2004 SACD, that is playable even with a normal CD player and provides higher sound quality, better stereo-image and less distortion."
5,one of the best,"the one to start it all yes i have been a fan seens this episode first was shown. ya a long time ago. it is about when rita rapulsa is relesed from a dumster on the moon she is an evil scorceres that is trying to ""concure earth"" then zordon finds 5 ""teen agers with attitude"" and they become the power rangers"
4,Really is a good cd,This is a good and fun cd to listen to if you have never seen the show then maybe it would not be as enjoyable like some of the other Cirque du Soleil soundtracks.
4,Vintage Lorca.,"This book of Federico Garcia Lorca has given me hours of entertainment and enjoyment the past days. I enjoyed the poems so much I'm reading them for the second time. Lorca evokes Andalusian magic and Gypsy airs float in the air, makes one feel like visiting Granada and Andalusia. Now I need to get my hands on more Federico Garcia Lorca books."
5,An Original World,"Marsella's writing creates an original world peopled with the kind of characters whom we might have met once or twice in the street, but whose lives we have never paused to think about. Alone, often displaced, her characters live in a world which is ours, only seen from a different angle. These stories paint a picture of another Paris: a city where immigrants from Turkey, Nigeria, Egypt live and work in conditions which most of us ignore. Her writing is, however, without judgment. Her readers, become themselves displaced, begin to see through a stranger's eyes. To those who know Paris well, the stage of her texts is immediately recognisable, but it has also changed to the extent where almost any miracle is now possible. All these stories are concerned with a form of liberation; and with the description of that liberation, her writing frees itself from what we are familiar with and takes on an almost mystical character."
5,The Best Anime Show!,"A couple of months ago I went to the store, with one of my friends and he told me to get Martian Successor Nadesico! I didn't though! But then I ended up going back a few weeks later and got it! What was I thinking not buying it the first time! This is by far the best anime show ever, it even says on the back on the DVD thing, voted best Anime show or whatever! Believe me, if you like anime you'll LOVE this. I mean, I only had to show one of my friends before he fell in Love with it! I mean thats all he talks about, it's actually getting annoying now! Only one of my friends didn't like it, but he says it's ok! But the thing is... Everyone, has really extended personality's or something, he also said that all the character's are either hyper, crazy, scary, or losers! But all the characters are cool! Ruri's the best! But what's so cool about this is that it has so many genres, it's a action, comedy, drama, and other stuff! I seriously suggest that you check it out!"
3,"Plots wander, humor continues ...","I picked up the second tape to get a grip on this series. Perhaps, I thought, the second tape would give me a renewed hope for the series...sadly, the second continues the pace and direction of the first which is not very enthusiastic, just more space silliness with hot chicks. Good art, again. A friend of mine had the Japanese DVD of the Nedesico movie 'Prince of Darkness', and I watched that as well, only to realize nothing this series does has much impact. It's just a confusing middle of the road anime series."
2,use your own judement,"Not bad for an anime series if you like comedy.I was kindda upset with it,becuase there was not enough action to get me involved.Don't get wrong, the mecha is great in the series,but a little too much comedy."
5,Listen to this...,"I've seen all of Nadesco's episodes up to episode six and I can tell you that I didn't just buy those videos to waste money, no surey Bob. I like this anime so much I can't wait to buy the rest of the series! You shouldn't just stop at this though, once you watch this anime you have got to watch others. I can give you tons of other anime series for you to watch that are so addicting(Fushigi Yugi) that you'll buy the whole series, but that's not my job. I'm here to tell you what a great anime Nadesco is, so I'll begin. This movie does not contain any graphic stuff(you know what I'm talking about) and it's the kind of movie that's best when watched alone or with a fellow anime lover. That's what makes Nadesco so cool. Wait, there might be something in there referring to you-know-what, but I wouldn't worry about it. It's a really good anime so you should buy it.Toodles!"
4,I felt like I just finished Evangelion again....,"While I enjoyed the beginning and middle of this series like Evangelion, I was disappointed at the open ended final episode where there are still questions that were left unanswered. Also, this dvd is pretty much barebones as all you get are the episodes with no significant extras like phot galleries, character profiles, etc. Still, its a nice anime series although I wished there were more series with a definite finality to the last episodes."
5,Gotta Watch This!,One of the funniest animes your going to find on the market. I don't think I've every laughed so hard before.The animation smooth and the dubbing is great. I can't really find anything really wrong with this series except a certain captain...
5,"WHAT A SERIES YOU DON""T WANT TO MISS IT .",THIS ACTION PACK WITH COMEDY SOME ROMANCE AND PLENTY OF COOL ROBOT FIGTING SENCE A MUST SEE SERIES .
5,Easy way to get a sense of a historical event.,"The manga form of presentation makes reading about the prelude to this event easy and fast. The book seemed to be reasonably accurate with historical documentation and the visual format allowed the author to include detail that might otherwise have become difficult to work into the story. The clothing, clogs, air raid hoods, etc. that are be depicted add depth of information to a quick read."
5,Effective and powerful,"I thought it was strange that this author chose to portray the devastating impact of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on his life in a comic book format, but when you finish the book you'll see that it was a very effective choice. The book has a very deep and very power message despite being in picture format with some silliness here and there to keep the reader entertained. I could feel the author's hatred for nuclear weapons after finishing this book."
5,Troubling story,Troubling story that Kaiji Nakazawa tells in this autobiographical manga. The sad reality of a post nuclear explosion in the midst of a Japanese society that has lost the second world war is vividly put on paper.Nakazawa lost his father and one brother in the explosion and he exposes the reality without hiding the dark side of human nature.It it difficult to come out of these books without a feeling of anxiety about the effect of wars on the most exposed layers of the population.
3,france,First thing I thought Of France Gall and this album is 'She sounds like an infant!' But her voice is sweet and soft and the melodies of the songs on each track are wonderful. I enjoy most of the album.
4,"Not Bad, But Use With Caution","There have been numerous books on the ""Great One"" and R.L. Taylor's is among the earliest. If the reader is to embark on a serious study of Fields, this should be the first book you read, but use it with caution. Fields was a great rancatour and if a lie would serve better than the truth, he did it. It's hard to seperate fact from fiction when dealing with Fields. No doubt he detested having his privacy intruded on, and his childhood was probably painful. Fields propped up his erratic life with hard drinking, which eventually killed him. And, so many of his tales sound like boozy comedy skits. Still, Fields life tends to read like a Dickens novel. The influence that Dickens had on the comedian is umistakeable, with film characters like short tempered ""Mr. Muckle"" the portly ""Adelai Brunch Souse"" and ""Professor Eustice McGargle"""
5,Stands the test of time,"The test of a truly good book is whether it stands the test of time. I just re-read this book and found it as relevant as the day it was published. These Harvard marketing and strategy gurus have mostly hit the nail on the head. Whether you're an entrepreneur with a business plan to pitch to KickStarter or you are the CEO of Apple, I argue that Markets of One will give you some good food for thought."
2,Boring,"After watching the trailer and reading the summary I expected this film to be a funny take on how men have evolved into a softer version of their former tough-guy selves. But in the end the entire movie is really focussed on body hair, male body hair to be specific. An hour and 23 minutes of body hair. So, my recommendation would be... If you are really into the male body hair debate, you will like this movie. Otherwise, it's not all that funny and collectively pretty boring."
3,amusing perspective,interesting premise. had some funny moments but could have been funnier. the beard section was interestingly bizare...it's not a sport ps.... hahah
3,"Interesting concept, mediocre delivery","The musings of Spurlock are often interesting, but the format of his movies has become predictable and this film is basically a carbon copy of his previous works, like Super Size Me."
2,Nowhere near as entertaining as the trailer made it seem.,"I feel like this film's trailer misrepresents the content of the film. This film ""stars"" Jason Bateman and Will Arnett, but they've got very little face-time, and most of their scenes appear in the trailer itself. Morgan Spurlock has more face-time, like the trailer suggests... but only in the first 30 minutes of the film. Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but I do feel like it could (and should) have been compressed down to 35-45 minutes instead of clocking in at 83 minutes. There were interesting segments, but our interest in most of them tapered out after 5-10 minutes (and the segments would go on for 15-20)."
1,Falls to pieces in just a few uses,"It looks cool in the photo, but it's quite fragile in your hands. Ours broke the first week...just sort of fell apart. The blades don't line up well either. Hard to clean. Miserable design. Obviously engineered and manufactured by the bottom of the barrel. A hands down, 100% FAIL."
5,does the job on those onions...,I bought this to help me with onions...chopping them without smelling fingers or tears...happy to say it does the job well. As long as you use forceful downward thrusts with low freqency it chops well. I would consider it a good buy for the money. Of couse it chops other things as well but I haven't tried it thoughly yet.
1,Easily broken,"I bought this for my sister last christmas, she opens it, it falls three feet onto soft carpet and half of the plastic parts cracked and later broke apart. That's pretty much all we can say about this chopper because it was broken before she was even able to use it.The price does NOT equal quality, stay away!"
1,Doesn't work well,"I have nearly the whole Rosle product line, and I love virtually all their products. Not this.I bought this to replace a now-unavailable Zyliss hand chopper which was superb.Although it is relatively sturdy, the plastic insert does not fit well, and it does not chop well. Onions can sometimes be ok, but it seems like the blades don't reach the cutting board. Also, a better design would pad the top of the plunge handle.To summarize, I almost never use this. However, a pleasant recent surprise was this chopper:Kuhn Rikon Swiss Chop Chop-- which I use all the time."
4,A mixed bag,"The Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela is indeed ""astonishing"" as is the large scale classical music program of this country which helps produce these young musicians. The documentary (91 MIN) is truly inspiring and their two encores at their Bonn Beethoven Festival concert are great fun both visually and musically. All the above are worth six stars. And the performance of the Eroica is dramatic and certainly not bad given the large size of the orchestra and its youth. If I were at the concert I too would be standing applauding at its conclusion, but it is doubtful that it will demand repeated listening on DVD. The competition is too great."
2,Not for first-time Czech learner,"The lessons go by very fast, with each phrase spoken only once. In order to learn, you must either have a super-human ear and memory, or you must listen to the CD 500 times. The CD might be a good review for someone who has already learned the language, but for the first-timer, consider the Pimsleur method instead."
3,Fly by Czech,"This product is just a quick run down of basic phrases and not a true Czech teacher, this won't teach you basic sentence structure, masculine and feminine differences, or even point out different variances of the words.For example; they will list ""dobr den"" as ""good day"" but ""dobrou noc"" as ""good night"" but not explain why there is a difference with ""dobr"" and ""dobrou."" I say buy this as a quick bloody or introduction to the Czech language, but don't visit Prague with just this if you want to have passable Czech."
1,"Standard anglo beats, nothing special here. . .","There is nothing in the least which is dynamic about this CD. Sounds like a cut and paste of beats with uninspired riffs overlayed, none of which reflect any real musical talent or anything which would be remotely infectious or danceable after hearing one or two songs of. Disappointed and misled. This has been sorely overrated by other reviewers. Listening to DJ Greyboy (Greybreaks vol. 1), Cut Chemist's material or the Breakestra would make this sound like silly amateur breakbeat wanna be caliber material."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"Being a fan of the Worst Case Scenario book series, I couldn't wait to get this calendar. However, the majority of material deals with ""Today in Survival History"" or ""Today's Hero"" rather than the now famous step-by-step survival instructions that are so amusing and/or useful in the books. It's still an interesting calendar, but not quite what I expected."
2,good sound quality,Speakerphone worked great. The batteries would not hold a charge for long and buttons were hard to press.
2,"Borrow, don't buy.","I'm not impressed with this one. It was supposed to give the readers (fans of E:FC) a glimpse into Boone's past, chronicle his first meeting with Augur, etc., etc. I didn't learn anything about Boone I didn't already know. The ""first meeting"" was trite. The book's one saving grace was the development of Kate, Boone's wife, a data wrangler of some considerable skill.So many things were glossed over, Kate's participation in the mysterious project, the ""Octopus,"" the arrival of the Taelons, etc. It became very frustrating. Frankly, this book read like a ""backstory sketch"" meant to provide other writers with a little background information in order to write more detailed books of their own. I'm sorry I bought it."
3,Flat,The writing doesn't have a pulse. The series seems to have fallen victim to drone writing assignments.
2,Dry and Lacking Value,"A potentially imaginative project has been cranked out with no fire, no magic. Very dry and uninspired writing ruins an otherwise fascinating Roddenberry treasure. Really disappointing. Critics or English teachers might have done a better job of breathing life into this one."
4,Interesting,"I haven't finished the book, but for what I have read and seen in the book, I can say I have enjoyed it very much."
5,The Wait is Over!,"After weathering many delays Robb's book finally sees the light of day and boy, was it worth the wait. Thoughtfully written and impecably researched, this book is to be included among the best guitar reference tomes of Tom Wheeler, Richard Smith, and Nacho Banos.The biography section in entertaining and informative, but the guitar section is where this book really throws down the goods. Awesomely photographed and interspersed with interviews and info. I have seen and read just about every vintage guitar book and was delighted to view many prototype guitars and details never seen in any book. The wonderful up-close pictures of ""Pearly Gates"" and ""Hot'Lanta"" were highlights.Sections on Les Paul amps, Customs, Juniors, Specials, and 45 pages of '58-'60 Les Paul Sunbursts in all of their glory...it's all here.Do not hesitate to get this book, you will not be disappointed!Robb Lawrence has certainly raised the bar with this book and I eagerly await volume II. Bravo Robb!!!!!"
2,A rip-off,Too short - almost a single run on sentence. I wish that Amazon would stock the kindle version of the Churchill autobiographies.
3,Mixed Feelings,"This was the first book I read on computers, when I didn't know anything about them. That was two years ago and now that I look back it was a decent book. I remember reading it and being fascinated, even though some stuff was a little complex. All in all this was a good book. If you're an absolute newbie then read it.This book is not good for advanced users though. Whether it claims to be or not, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT ABOUT COMPUTER HARDWARE ALREADY. If you do you will be disappointed. That's why I always go for books that are more advanced to push myself."
2,"Nice package, poorly reasoned","This a handsomely conceived and executed volume. The problems begin when you start reading it. An astonishing number of topics are confusingly discussed and related, creating confusion where clarity would be appreciated. The author(s) also seem to have made no determination beforehand who the target audience would be, jumping from beginner-level explanations to pointlessly involved details. Techies won't find much to use here, and tyros will find themselves endlessly reading and re-reading passages trying to glean some meaning. Trust me- there are better- much better- basic manuals on PC's!"
3,It is a good overview,The book covers many aspects of PC hardware and software and it is very good if you need an overview. If you want understand the details of these aspects this is not your book. Sometimes the concepts are difficult to understand because there are not enough figures.
3,Confusing & quite often complex,.. I was not overly impressed. Being new to the inner workings of a PC I was immediately lost. I've had to read chapters over in order to understand what the authors are trying to say. What has helped me was another computer manual that was beutifully illustrated and helped me to recognize the parts & pieces of hardware that Mr. Norton referred to in his book. I did like the glossary though. This book is definitely not one to recommend to beginners.
3,v. strange book,"If you're gonna read this book be prepared for reality. This is not the usual fantasy story where the good guy beats all odds to win. Many of the good guys are actually killed during the story (which I found a little strange. George builds up characters for 1000+ pages then KILLS them... i suppose that's reality though). And the ending? Also a little strange. I confess, I thought it kicked ... how some characters got revenge but still, none of the situations are really tied up at the end of the trilogy.If you like kings, queens and knights read this book but don't set yourself up to be completely happy with the ending."
2,Simply too much rape,"I had to stop reading this book (and the series) because the author simply spends too much time describing Gregor's rape campaign. Enough already, he's a bad dude ~ we get it ~ move on! I mean in the entire Malazan series (10 000 pages and counting) there is just 1 incidence of rape and it's only mentioned obliquely moreto explain a change to her character. Quite simply it's gross and very off putting. I won't waste any more of my money. Plus the books are too damn slow with too many storylines."
3,What happened?,"All the praise heaped on the first two books is well deserved. They are wonderful, and I would recommend them to anyone who has a taste for anything remotely like fantasy fiction. I couldn't wait to get this third book, but after reading it, feel that it didn't live up to the promise of the first two. I agree with the reviewer from New Zealand; it seems almost as though Mr. Martin lost his way... Still, the series as a whole is a great accomplishment, and I would go so far as to say that the first two books set a new standard for the genre."
3,...and the disappointment begins,"I really, really enjoyedA Game of ThronesandA Clash of Kings. 5 stars for each. A Storm of Swords, however, is leaving me feeling depressed. It is just too dark. I am not looking for a Harry Potter-type series here, where all the good guys win and all the bad guys lose. But come ON. Give me something. A little shred of hope to hold on to. I am 60% through the book (according to my Kindle), and I don't want to pick it back up. I've just finished two consecutive chapters filled with the deaths of all of my favorite people. I can't handle it anymore.Is it too much to ask for a nice mix of good guys living and dying? Instead of them all dying?I'm not sure I will finish this book, or if I will read the next. I hope in the HBO series they change it a bit and let some of the more likable characters live."
4,It's starting to wear thin,"I devoured the first two novels, and leapt right into this one. And while I'm hooked, Martin's style is starting to tire me. I like how he ends each chapter on a little cliff-hanger. The problem is, he rarely picks up from where he leaves off. When he returns to the characters the crisis has been resolved, and we learn how in flashback.I've also had my fill of dwarf sex. The 'adult' scenes are just not well written at all.And one final gripe: this third book is pretty much 600+ pages of endless misery. Sure it's war and war is ugly. But even Tolstoy gave his characters a few moments of respite. This felt like a non-stop series of mutilations, humiliations, and torture.So I give four stars, but only reluctantly. I still enjoy the plot twists, and I'm invested enough to want to know how the surviving characters fare. The ending was great. I'm just worried that I won't be able to handle three more volumes of the same."
5,Incredible,"Who actually gave this book less than 5 stars? I saw the rating when looking through Amazon today, and I couldn't believe someone could rate this less than 5. Martin doesn't care who dies, nor does he care who wins. More than that, there are no lines of good and evil drawn. Anyone that's read other reviews, or the book will see this. More than this, though, is his style. He can write, and he can write well. Not all of the Fantasy of our Era is well written. This, however, is well written. Full marks for a well written book, book 4 is highly anticipated."
5,Amazing.,"It is incredibly long, but it goes by quickly because, let's face it, it's addicting. You'll find yourself saying ""Whaaaaat?"" dozens of times. Prepare to have your mind BLOWN."
4,Fantastic Twists,This book was a little slow in the middle but really picks back up by the end. The twists are great and this fantastic story remains very interesting.
4,"Not as good as the first two, but still a great read!","Like the first two books in the series, I enjoyed this book. I am becoming a bit frustrated with some of storylines at this point though. I would have liked to see it move a bit faster; the pace is starting to become a bit frustrating as well as some of the storylines. Still a great read!"
5,Keeps you wanting more,"Do not read if you have important things to get done, because it is a long book that will always be on your mind and hard to set down."
4,George RR Martin Rocks,Once you start reading this series you can't wait to read the next book let alone watch the HBO series!
5,Amazing!,I could hardly put this book down. Probably my favorite of the series so far despite all the bad things that happen to the Starks.
4,good book,This book has so many plot twists its never dull. I really enjoy this series. The action is non stop and well written. I suggest this book for anyone that loves the HBO series or fantasy fiction.
4,a storm of swords,clash of kings storm of swords series was asked for and given as a gift. The person to whom the this one of several we bought for him was liked and read.
4,Great Action Book!,Great action packed book. Can get a little too detailed at times but captivating none the less. Definitely a great winter read.
5,Dynamic and gripping.,Characters in the novel which previously did not make an impression on me or grab my attention are now some of the most interesting and exciting people in the book. At the end of each character chapter I found myself wanting to continue reading about this particular person.
2,Review of Kindle edition not of book,"Fie on the editors for how they handle the maps. While I was not surprised that I couldn't read the maps on my kindle, I though on my computer Kindle program I would be able to -- and I should be able to! But instead they have them in there so small and at such a low resolution that they are worthless! I can zoom on my phone but again, so such a low resolution that they become fuzzy before they become readable -- the ""look inside"" preview pages are much better than the maps once you have bought the kindle version. A definite downside to the kindle books -- and unnecessary given the accompanying computer and phone programs for these books."
2,Misleading,"When this book first came out Martin had to put out a letter explaining that he had to chop it down to half the characters because it would have been too big. He said to expect the rest in six months.HOGWASH! Where is the rest of it? Just like Robert Jordan and his ""Wheel of Time"" series, this story got away from Martin and we may never see the end."
5,The plot thickens!,"What most readers want to know is simply ""Is this book worth my time?"" At over 1100 pages (paperback), it does seem daunting and leaves one wondering how much the author can delve into these characters and plotlines without falling into the asinine, pointless, verbosity that has afflicted Robert Jordan (just because it's 1000 pages does NOT make it engaging!). The answer to that question is an emphatic YES! The pace is quick; small things happen rapidly, while the overall story rolls ahead like a tidal wave. Reading this book is like watching a living chess board. The reader feels the character's conflicts, sympathizes and empathizes. This novel is great! I'm left wanting more!"
5,All hail the King,"George R.R. Martin is the king of the fantasy genre. He is doing things that nobody else is even thinking about in their work at this time. To mention him alongside other mere fantasy authors is to lower the respect and pedestal I place him on.Enough with the hyperbole. This novel is by far the most gripping book I have read in a long time. You can pick it up and read the first 400 pages. But after page 450 or so, I could simply not put it down. Every chapter is an amazingly compact story of its own, which can and does, gasp, advance the story line. Reading a 900 page book by GRRM leaves you howling, gasping, and begging for more of the tight storyline.There is no one else who does what he does right now. There will certainly be imitators in the future. All hail the once and future king of fantasy."
3,A GREAT BOOK,This is a great book for those who would like a change from the happy go lucky books of most fantasy books where everyone lives and the good guys win at ever turn.Although I would normally give this a better rating I finish Crossroads of Twilight before I read this and I could not stand another novel where ether nothing happens or all chance for my favorite characters to rule out with there first life.
1,A HUGE LETDOWN,"The first two volumes of Martin's ""Song of Fire and Ice"" were GREAT. Book 3 is a horrible disappointment. Can you say ""Filler?"" Literally hundreds of pages pass where absolutely NOTHING happens. Martin is on the money train now, the one being run by Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind and their clones. And Martin has his characters start doing stupid, totally out-of-character things just to shock the reader. It felt contrived, shallow, and, well, dumb. The few significant scenes in this book take up less than a hundred total pages. But you have to slog through a whole lotta to get to them. I know you'll read it, no matter what the reviews say. But you'll be profoundly disappointed."
1,Wait a couple of years for Mr Martin to finish the story,"I normally never buy a newly released fantasy book because I have this strange desire of actually wanting a frickin' end to the stories I read. Seeing this third book released, I figured I was safe - oh, how wrong I was. Three thousand pages of story and very little is resolved. I recommend waiting a couple of years and then visiting your local half-price bookstore. In the meantime, go read something else."
1,"Wretched, wretched crap.","If, like me, you liked the first two (for some reason that completely escapes me now), you probably want to read this one. Don't bother. Make up your own ending. Hell, publish it online as fanfiction to really piss off the hack whose name is on the cover, who can't be bothered to create interesting characters but that's okay, he's going to start killing them soon enough. Boring, repulsive, rambling, violent, and showing absolutely no respect for the reader, this is one of THE worst books I have ever read.It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be able to truly say that Jordan dead is a much better author than Martin ever could be alive."
5,Amazing book!,"I loved this books, the characters are so vivid and complex and they really feel real. I wanted to say, not about the book, but regarding the Kindle formatting, that I had balked at buying it at first because someone commented that the chapters weren't separated and there was no index. Someone else said they were missing a chunk of the book. Maybe the formatting has been updated or maybe a few people got a corrupted download, but the Kindle version looks just like the book. There is a chapter index so you can skip ahead to a certain chapter. I started this book in paperback and so when I got it on Kindle I had to jump ahead. I just thought it would be good for people to know that the formatting is exactly the same as the physical book so you shouldn't worry on that account.The writing is just as fantastic as the first two books. The twists and turns are amazing and unpredictable. I loved it and I can't wait to start the next book in the series."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I have been buying books from Amazon since the site opened and this is the first review I am writing.This series is outstanding. It effectively explodes all the conventions of the hackneyed, formulaic and boring Sword and Sorcery genre. Where The Lorf of the Rings is black and white, ASOIAF is all grey areas and realpoltik.Do youself a favor and buy all five books."
4,Give it a chance!,First I must say I am a big fan of the Game of Thrones saga. I would recommend it to anyone who likes adult fantasy. The beginning of this third book was a bit dull and slow that's why I'm not rating it five stars but as the book progressed evrything started clicking and I couldn't put it dowm!!!! Just plod through the first chapters and then get ready to be surprised!!!
4,My mind is amazed but my heart is disappointed,GRRM is a great writer but sometimes i feel like he forces huge turn arounds just because he wants to and for no major reason. Some deaths really disappointed me in this book and i wanted to put it down but it's to good to let go now...
5,Martin does it again.,"Martin continues to do it again, and deliver a beautifully written drama of the characters we have grown to know and love. And if you didn't love them before, you will either hate them even more and surprise yourself with your adoration of them. Old characters, new characters, and supernatural events you couldn't have imagined at all will keep you frantically turning the pages through this thrill of a novel. Also, Martin will kill people off in a heartbeat, because he's an amazing author and will never deliver a predictable solution to the mess this game of thrones has made. My absolute FAVORITE of the series, Storm of Swords, will continue to help your obsession with Westeros, and spark your interest even further."
5,Awesome book,Absolutely loved this book. So far this is the best from the series. Well written and kept me on edge the whole time.
2,Killing off main characters is counterproductive,"When I started reading A Game of Thrones, I was fascinated by the storyline and characters. As the story continued through the next few books, many (if not most) of the main characters, or at least my favorite ones, were killed off by the author. What began as a sort of shock therapy has finally resulted in my lack of interest. Whether or not all the killing gives the story a feel of realism, the truth is that fiction is supposed to be entertainment. Martin has not been able to replace the characters with others of equal interest. It's like your sibling who has been married 4 times -- it's impossible to care as much about number 4 as you did earlier. For me, I'm done; I'm not moving on to volume four."
4,Excellent book,This whole Song of Ice and Fire saga is definitely worth reading! I strongly recommend it if you like books you can't stop reading!
3,Interesting but why?,"If this was not the third book in the series, I don't believe it would hold my attention. That being said, I found this one a decent read. Martin certainly holds no character safe and gives no quarter to the commonly followed practice of keeping major players alive. There are answers here to some questions that I thought were already answered, and now new questions that have compelled me to pick up book number four."
5,Best bood so far. Half way through it,"I got hooked on the first book, the second was a little better. This one far outshines the previous two. I hope the rest of the series is as good."
2,Overrated and the author is an egomaniac!,"I must admit that I enjoyed reading the first 2 books in this series, but this one just started to drag. The author is full of himself to use ""R.R."" in his name like Tolkien, but he doesn't come close. He is so concerned with producing 10 lb books that he can't generate the next volume within a decent time frame. It would serve us all right if he croaks before he can finish this overblown series.As a lover of LOTR, my only problem with Tolkien was that he has inspired too many authors that are unable or unwilling to finish a story line within a reasonable number of volumes or pages. Methinks guys like Martin are more concerned with hooking readers into a life-time annuity of income for themselves rather than actually concluding a story. Or perhaps he has created so many interrelated story lines that even he can't figure out how to end it!"
1,"For God's sake, finish the damn thing!!!!!","I read the first two installments of this project with some enthusiasm thinking I would likely enjoy it since it was being made into a TV series and I enjoy some fantasy works. And I did enjoy them for a while. But this book goes nowhere and I am sick of the characters. I want some resolution and I understand there are at least two more books after this one. It goes on and on ad nauseum. This whole story could have been done in a couple of good books instead of dragging it out so interminably. I can't finish this book and I am sure I won't read anymore of Martin's work. I get the strong feeling his writing is more about the $$$ he can pull in from poor suckers like me, than about producing a good, readable tale. Enough is enough. I have better things to do and read."
5,Great Book,"This is a great series. The author understands how to tell a story, and that the story is more important that any one character. It can be a rollercoaster of emotion, but it is a great story. Not appropriate for kids though. Or any adult that is sensitive to adult types of content."
1,A Storm of Swords,"A ripoff! A Scam. I THOUGHT I was ordering the Kindle edition of George R.R. Martin's ""A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)"". What I got was summary of each chapter, written apparently by someone who has never really read the book, or if they had, never read for comprehension. Beware reader - this is not the book written by Martin. It is a flawed ""cliff notes"" version.I should have inspected the address of the sender a little more closely. It was Book Rags.com Book Club Guide. That's right: the only place you're going to get a clue that this is a ""Guide"" is in the address of the sender. Caveat Emptor."
5,Breathtaking,"This book is as good as the first two. The characters continue to develop, the war continues, everyone is in peril...By now I have an emotional stake in the characters and, as with the previous ones, I was turning the pages as fast as I could to learn the outcome of each new situation. The plot twists had me holding my breath, and I nearly cried in several places.As with book two, the book ends in a maddeningly frustrating cliff hanger, and book four isn't due out until the fall. ARRGG!!!!This series is truly epic, and it's extremely well written. I can't stand it that the next book isn't out yet."
5,"The plot thickens, the world unravels","If you are reading this, then you've probably read the previous 2 books, and you must have liked them, or you wouldn't be interested.Then, prepare to be : shocked, enthralled, disgusted, and betrayed. All these things and more, in a world that simplifies itself, then charges on ahead, where there are plans within plans, and where the threats come from the mnost unlikely places and persosn. Tyrion the Imp, shows his deep human side, and becomes the character I most like to identify with, except for Robb. Can somebody please kill Joffrey and his mother already. Jaime Lannister becomes less hateful, and the dog Clegane becomes an unlikely protector.As the plot moves, or flies along, the twists and turns of the action become harder and harder to follow, and every few chapters, everything changes.I can't wait for the next chapter, because, if Martin can tie all the loose ends together coherently he will have proven that he is an unsurpassed master at his craft."
5,Another masterpiece!,"George RR Martin has done it again in A STORM OF SWORDS. Here we have yet another brilliant addition to the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series. Everything present in ""A Game of Thrones"" and ""A Clash of Kings"" once again makes a showing. The characters continue to develop new dimensions and the plot twists and turns and results in unexpected but still logical conclusions. Martin's direct and hold-nothing-back style of writing remains just as moving and effective as in the first two books.If you have read ""A Game of Thrones"" and ""A Clash of Kings"" already, then I probably don't even need to tell you to buy this. Do so. You will not be disappointed a bit. That is, at least until the part where you have to put A STORM OF SWORDS down..."
1,Utterly Depressing,Nothing good ever happens in these books. I read for enjoyment and these books just made me frustrated and depressed. Maybe people like that sort of thing but I would rather read something good.
3,I'm bored,"I was blown away by the first two books in the series, and all of the positive things that have been said about books are true: riveting story lines, amazing character development, beautiful writing style. But by the middle of the third book, I was beginning to have enough, enough of the lengthy descriptions of family colors and crests, enough of the requisite twist at the end of *every* chapter, enough of Martin thinking I have the time to waste sitting around watching his dazzling display of verbosity. By the end of the book, I just wanted to get it over with. For book 4, I found a detailed plot summary online, and let that suffice. I may do the same for book 5, if it ever appears. I guess I'm not sure there's a point to investing my time and emotional energy in a storyline where at the end, there probably won't be any characters left, and the land will be so ruined, it won't be worth claiming by anyone. There are plenty of far more satisfying reads out there."
4,Ice and Fire,"His series is entertaining and filled with unexpected events. There are times when the descriptive narrative interferes with the plot lines which can be annoying. It is also clear that he has written this to produce as many books as possible. One would think that the 9th to 11th centuries in Europe creates the settings, with a little magic thrown in."
4,Solid addition to the series,The third installment of this series was slow for the first third to half but then the action really picks up. Heads will roll
4,Turns and Twists,"While not as riveting as the previous two books, ""A Storm of Swords"" is still exciting to read because it adds so many twists and turns to the already complex plot. New characters are introduced and new enemies emerge, but what keeps the book fun to read are the old characters that we have come to love and hate."
5,Great continuation of a fantastic saga,The Song of Fire and Ice series is one of the best things I've read in a long time. Book III continues with the great character and plot development of the first two volumes.
5,Best of the series so far!,"I got started on this series when the HBO series came out and I love these books far more than the show! They are huge books which just makes me happy because I know I have a lot more to enjoy. The pace never lets up - I never want to put it down! When I am driving home from work and I start to think of the characters and what is going on, I am anxious to have my reading time. Isn't that the sign of a fabulous book?? Get started on this series, you won't regret it!"
5,Part of the Song of Fire and Ice series,"Fantastic book. Read the series. However, warning, I have been waiting for the conclusion to this series for two years. I know many of this fans have given up, but I still believe that he will complete this series - come on George!"
3,Keeps you wanting more...,"I'd have to rewrite the review of the previous parts here. It basically keeps you looking for more, doesn't bore you!!On to the 4th..."
5,Really great,"A Storm Of Swords, is a great book, although it does have it slow points, but most books do. I dont usually start series books because I read pretty fast, and then have to wait a really long time for the next book to come out. But these books are worth it. I cant wait for the 4th to come out, to bad it wont be till fall 2002."
4,reading this book now.,Very surprising . many surprises throughout the book. some i didn't like. But it is a really good series. I have already bought the fourth one.
4,More turns than u would expect,"If you like unpredictable storylines, this is your book!However if you liked the first two you will like this even better.Very enjoyable."
3,Saga continues slowly,"The Game of Thrones had been totally engaged in this world of knights, kings, passion and sword fighting, but I felt the story started to loose momentum further into the books."
3,Decent read if you like out there fantasy,Kind of a combination sci-fi / midevil fantasy book as is the whole series. Interesting read though sometimes hard to follow as it's written from the perspective of each character one at a time. have to admit there are always plenty of twists and turns.
5,Great book series,"I began by watching the TV series, and as usual, you cannot capture on film the brilliance between the pages. I find myself ever-entwined emotionally with these well-written characters, and cannot wait for the next chapter."
5,"Super, Awesome, Amazing, Fabulous, Stupendous, Indescribable","All of those words in the title - no, I'm being serious. The whole series is freaking AWESOME!!!! Read them! That's all I can say!!"
5,Not a fantasy fan,"I personally don't like fantasy books. I've tried reading them but I don't think I've ever finished one, including LOTR. Historical fiction is my preference. Bernard Cornwell's great Saxon series is one example. I asked a co-worker who reads fantasy almost exclusively to try the Saxon series. He enjoyed it and told me I would like the Song of Fire and Ice series. Well, he was wrong. I LOVE it! For some of you the lack of wizards and dragons etc is a disappointment but for me, Dani's storyline with the dragons is the weakest part of the series. But Martin has created a fantastic world and I can't seem to wait to read what happens next. A hint: it's probably not what you think will happen. Well I gotta go. Several ""good"" characters just got whacked at an otherwise festive occasion. Gotta see what happens next."
5,So good!,I have read all three books in the series and loved them. Now I'm waiting for Feast for Crows Book 4. It can't come soon enough.
5,The Greatest,"All other fantasy is trash compared to this. Read George R.R. Martin, as no other books match. Plain and simple."
5,love to hate,we start to see the characters more clearly. and the characters you once loved you start to hate and the ones you once hated you start to love.
4,A good place to stop,"I was so thrilled with Book 1 (A Game of Thrones) that I powered through the next two books within a couple of weeks. A Storm of Sword is equal, if not better, than #1 -- and, btw, #2 is also quite good, if somewhat more plodding. After a couple thousand pages of time investment, which was rewarding enough, I feel like A Storm of Swords is a good place to stop.ASOS has all the great twists, turns and ruthless fates of its predecessors, but there's a sense that forward thrust is starting to slow. For #4 and #5, I'm switching to book summaries.I might pick up the series gain when #6 comes out, assuming/hoping reviews indicate it offers progress and resolution on the handful of characters about which I care."
4,"Hard to put down, once you pass the midway mark","Like the two before this third in the series, A Storm of Swords delivers twists and turns, action and intrigue, with a great host of believable characters that you love, hate, cheer for and die with. This installment weaves even more interesting events and changes into what I feel may yet be one of the greatest epic fantasy series I have ever read. Highly recommended!"
5,Wow.,"I loved this book, and after reading it, the only disappointment I had was that it was over. I think that Martin does a wonderful job devolping the characters, and setting the scene, and his story flows very well, unlike Jordan's Winters Heart, which I'm reading now. A Storm of Swords hooks the reader almost immediately, and the only problem I had while reading the book was that I had forgotten who Davos was, and his chapters seemed a little boring to me. Other than that, I loved the book, and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Captivating and Tantalizing! A must have!!!,So far this book is the best in the series. The plot lines that were first started in A Game of Thrones have grown larger and deeper. The characters are so alive that I actually found myself getting caught up in thier struggles. George R.R. Martin has a true gift with story telling. The characters are so in depth and unique. The web of deception so intricate and thick. I highly recommend this book and the series for any fan of the genre and for those who aren't.
4,very good,"Very good book. Good series, will keep you intrigued and wondering what will happen next. Characters that you become attached to."
4,I really like this author,I like the trilogy although Martin does skip around and you really have to pay attention or you get lost
2,A Storm of Wind,"I loved the first 2 books but am having trouble finishing third. The plot moves at glacial slowness. In the first 2 books the long-winded descriptions were fun. But I do not need 5-10 pages every time somebody eats lunch. Most reviewers were happy with this book, but take a look at the less enthusiastic reviews of 4 & 5. If George Martin had the sense to write a Trilogy he might have had a masterpiece. As an alternative he should have kept each book to 500 pages.The HBO TV series is off to a good start. They will leave out the 'starchy filler' so I think I'll watch the TV version and skip the rest of the books."
4,"Can't put it down, but it annoys me","I couldn't put this book down, but there were times when I wanted to throw it out the window. A great story, but every once in a while something horrible happens to a favorite character or a villain fails to get his just punishment."
3,Great series...so far.,"I loved the first two books and forgive the occasional cliche scenes and support characters because of the pace and atmosphere he keeps up.But...in this latest book, too many (potential hero) characters are not in control of their own destinies for far too long, drifting with the tide of events and losing all my interest as they do so.It seems like he is padding out many of the key players because he isnt ready for them to make their mark till later in the series, probably after the Dragons return to the mainland.There is still time to pull it back but I am waiting for the next book with uneasy anticipation, fingers crossed."
2,Loyalty and Honor doesn't mean anything in this series,"I got to half way in the third book, and just got disgusted. Georgie has a sickness for the trashy and the bad guys just out right murdering...um I am at a lost of words. He can't even allow an 8 year old girl to get home to her mother. Just let her get to her mother for the love of God!....Clearly he could have made more of the dire wolves and the Starks....I can see that the children of Ned Stark with their wolves could have gathered and conquered at the right time. Nope, he loves bad guys. He allows the Lasiters to escape all horror, tradegy, and loss, but the Honorable, Loyal, he just writes his death of the righteous. I hate it, and I threw the book across the room. I won't waste the rest of my time. I hope you suffer George, like the Starks......"
2,The story of Job,"The fact that the story is well written only makes it worse. The main characters spend the whole book experiencing sorrow and hardship. None of the characters you come to like ever have anything good happend to them, and most of the end up dead. At least in the first two books some of the characters did well, but in this last book everyone is either dead or locked up. This makes the book tiresome. I wish I stopped at book 2, I would be a happier person now if I hadn't read this book! I spend each chapter waiting for the axe to drop on the next character. This isn't a fantasy book, its a tragedy!!! Shame on you George RR Martin!"
5,"If you haven't read this yet, you must.","Martin is a storyteller par excellance.He takes a genre which is riddled with formulaic plot and characters and turns it completly upside down.If you read fantasy novels so often that you know the beginning and end before you open the book and you are just looking for some entertainment in the middle, don't read this book!Every chapter will astound you, confuse you and frustrate your every effort to predict the future.In all, this book is a ride on a rollercoaster with the lights out and the seatbelt a little too loose. A blast!!"
1,Oh please end the misery.......,"What started out as a good thing has slipped beyond mediocrity into drivel. Martin is stretching this tale out and one wonders whether he will ever get to the point ala many of the modern fantasy writers i.e., Jordan. I reread all 3 of the books issued just to be sure I was being fair. I realize now the unkindest cut of all is coming from the author who is perpetuating a long drawn out seemingly pointless story on all who had the misfortune to hope that finally a tale worthy of being held up to LOTR was being presented to us. I enjoyed the first book and eagerly anticipated the second. I was disappointed with it and hoped for redemption with the third. My dejection was compounded by the third installation. To hades with this nonsense. DONT write another...oh please end the misery......."
1,Too nasty for good fantasy + hilarious typo,"My husband has been reading this series and says that it's just too explicit (dirty) for Christian women to even read. I love fantasy, but I guess I'll stick with Robert Jordan & Terry Goodkind. Plus, he found a hilarious typo that was overlooked in proofreading! On page 495 of the paperback 2011 edition, it states, ""Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they left behind, to rape their windows and put their children to the sword."" I think it would be difficult to perform that act on a ""window""."
5,"read it slow...it'll be years to book four, yes that's right","As I neared the end, I was afraid there wouldn't be enough room for the grand resolution I was hoping. Seemed Martin thought so too. He has said in an interview that this will be a five or six book series with two years between the publishing of each. This book is even better than the first two. Cast aside any notions of what you thought was going to happen at the end of Book 2. If you've come this far in the series..I don't need to say more; you know."
4,Storm of Swords,"If A Clash of Kings was considered a sequel, then A Storm of Swords can be considered its own magnum opus. Martin's writing is just as stellar as ever and the plot moves along at a steady pace. I do not see Robert Jordan's failings creeping into Martin's writing. Holding to the theme of a quasi-history novel, Martin begins to stir things up a little bit more with some magic-related things. You may dislike certain characters, but by the end of this book, you will better understand them and their desires."
4,brutality a litte over the top,"This is the most brutal of his books so far & turns out to be quite depressing. It's certainly as good as the others, but I found myself not wanting to read too much at a time because it was so disturbing. Yes, I will continue to slog through the whole series, but there's only so much blood, gore & cruelty I can take at one sitting."
1,"Waste of time, Waste of plot...","Reading this series is such a waste of time. By the time I got to book 4, because I was hoping so much that the books would get better, that progress would be made. However, no progress is made in this book. It was just a waste of time. There is no REAL plot in this series. I am very surprised by the so many who like this series. It SUCKS!!!! I would rave a bit more, but I feel that this book wasted so much of my time, and I don't feel like wasting any more time with it. If the HBO series is exactly like the book series, I won't even bother watching the show. It's pointless. All the main characters die, there is no progress with kaleesi and her dragons. We don't get to see Arya's wolf again. It's all just a waste of time. With none of the characters getting anywhere."
1,Underage kids?,"Has anyone but me noticed that most of the female individuals in the book are either underage or being abused and disempowered? Very weird... What kind of sadistic and sexually repressed mind would write this stuff? Who are the readers that give these books five stars and actually ""like"" this mess? Besides the strangely negative, sadistic and perverse text, this material is soooooo repetitive and boring. No commitment to anything of substance like story or characters. With no imagination or creativity the author is jumping all over the place like a preteen with untreated ADHD and attachment issues. I can't believe this soapy-simple stuff was up for an award, ever! I recommend some therapy for potential socio-sexual issues and focus. I am certainly not touching this trash again. One would have to be a masochist to keep reading this cruel nonsense."
3,Same book as book 2,"I am surprised that people loved this book so much. Not because the author and the story are fantastic and wonderfully wrought with enough twists to keep your head spinning, but the third book is nothing but a repackaged version of the second book. I was extremely dissappointed to find that out.Read the excerpt pages and you will find out that you have read those words before."
4,Storm of Swords,The third book of a series and follow the story line. I have not finished it yet but am enjoying it.
2,Storm of swords... paperback reissue Aug 2005 missing pages,"When I got to page 496 of this version and started reading the next page I realized that something was missing.... the very next page was 561. Maybe just this one book, but ????? I suggest maybe trying a different version. If you've managed to get this far in this series, you know that a lot may be missed in 65 pages."
3,The Jordan Trap,"George Martin seems to be falling into the same trap as Robert Jordan in his Wheel of Time series.Too many characters, too many story lines and a plot that's moving at a glacial pace. He needs to tie things up and reach a conclusion in a couple of books. This book hardly moves the saga along. Character development is important but not the cost of losing your readers!"
3,Same story again..need new editor,"I loved the first two books. Unfortunately, this one is a lot like them. Same basic story of competitors for the throne with flashes of foreboding of ""the Others."" This time, Martin needed a good editor. There's endless wandering about the woods in a grey rain (or snow) with characters arriving at sites just after other characters left or passing one another in the night. And this goes on for the first half of the book (500 pages!). A good editor could have cut this part down quite a bit. A lot was unnecessary and self-indulgent and didn't add anything.In the second half, things pick up quite a bit and the story really kicks in. It's well-written, engaging, and surprising. Wonderful, in fact.I hope the next book picks up where this one left off, rather than taking the first half to set the tone yet again. While I will buy the next book, I don't anticipate it with the same eagerness I had before book 3. I'm afraid I won't get to the second half next time."
2,"A Sweeping Tapestry, entirely in gray, black, and brown.","Oh, gods... I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books. His stories progress at a glacial pace. This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent. Or rather, the majority of them aren't. If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading (Tyrion for example). Or if the characters were effective, that would be alright. The characters are too often like pieces of flotsam tossed on rough seas. Life is like that sometimes. But it doesnt make for good storytelling.The books I'm reminded of most to compare these to are Brin's Galactic Civilization books. He also split the story among many characters. But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like. Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle."
3,disappointing,"I loved this first three books, and give them 5 stars. However, I wanted to jump into following the story from the previous books. I'm only half way through this one, but it's just not keeping my interest like the others. There are too many new characters when I just want to finish up with my old ones."
5,Many Surprises In Store,"You will experience a broad range of emotions when you read this book. I did the same thing one of the other people who reviewed this book did when he threw it down in anger. But that only compels you to read on, because you know the good guys have to win sometime. The thing I liked best about this book was the introduction of the supernatural. It doesn't drown you in it like Goodkind and Jordan do, but it does add another level to the series. All in all this is one of the best written books I have read. The only negative thing I can say is that I get tired of Martin killing off the characters we grow close to."
2,So disappointed,"I loved the first two books of the series, but just can't get myself to finish this one (about 600 pages into it). Why? Because the characters are constantly doing stupid things. Anything to get into more trouble.In the first two books, the characters always felt honest. Their choices made sense to me even when the paths they picked were the dangerous ones. But in this book, the characters simply seem reckless -- especially King Rob and his mother. They just seem to do whatever it takes to get into deeper trouble, even when that course is obviously pointless. The series started to be a problem for me with Theon. Why does he do anything? As far as I can tell, he's there to make sure some characters make stupid choices later on. When that's finished, so is Theon. Just pointless.At any rate, the first book is simply great. But I'm deeply disappointed with this one."
1,I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THEM TO FIX MY REQUEST FOR 3 MONTHS!!,"I originally ordered this book, the regular sized version, and they sent me the mass production version even though they made no reference that it was the smaller sized version. They are the ONLY company that sent me the wrong one, and I bought all five books of this collection. I wrote a bad review, and they promised to send me the correct one if I removed it, and so I removed it, and it's been 3 MONTHS! I STILL havent received the book. They are all professional in their emails, but who cares when you pay for something you never receive?? I don't want your professionalism without your ethics!"
1,A turn for the worse,"I decided to read the books because, my mom turned me on to the HBO Series. I really liked the series and as you know there's never enough time in a movie or tv series to give you the back story. The first two books followed the storyline mostly and provided the necessary background information to give you a fuller picture of the characters and so forth. In the third book the story has taken such a turn for the worse that now, I not only don't want to finish the book. I may not even continue watching the series. What a turn off for me. It's just like Harry Potter all over again. I put in so much time reading those books, seeing those movies and the end was awful. It made me feel like I wasted my time. I just don't want to do it again."
3,Really? Wow,"I wont to a spoiler here but I am just so frustrated with the way this book turned the series around. I put the book down about 1/2 way through and I have to process what I just read and the ramifications of the events that unfolded. So yes, complex story lines and endearing characters. I will finish this and move to the next, but darn it. I liked the first 2 books much more"
4,Fantastic,"Just when I thought I knew what would happen next, Martin surprised me again and again. I could barely put this book down. Much better than book two."
5,A Storm of Swords,"Gripping fast paced storylines that take hold and wont let go. George Martin has let his imagination run-away in an orderly and fascinating fashion. I hope with all sincerity that his story, imagination, and committment to the task have the staying power necessary to take me to the last page with the same intensity."
5,The Only King of High Fantasy- G.R.R Martin,"If I had the power, I'd crown a new king of fantasy. G.R.R, the other R.R., seems to get better with every book. Unlike the majority of fantasy authors in business today, Martin decided to wow us with realism and gripping plotlines, as opposed to dragons and wizards shooting fire every few pages. I read this book in two and a half days, and I'm still confused why it took me so long. Read this series, please, you will be better for the experience, and you might even begin to respect yourself. I know i did."
3,Book,"Its a book and I can read off of it, and i dont need to charge at night. If I drop it, it does not break."
2,too much porn...,"I read somewhere that this man is an american J.R.R.T. No, he is not. For starters, J.R.R.T. had monsters, creatures etc. I think this will be the last book by this man that I read. At first, his porn fantasy wasn't so bothering until this particular book where it became more and more adult related and a full chapter about sex is just boring and not very exciting. Especially with how horrible it is written. I hate to burst the author's bubble but it usually is ""slopping wet"" in that area, as he so decidingly stated.It is just boring to keep reading about family vs. family vs. family with little description about anything else."
2,I'm done!,"I'm new to this series. My brother was telling me how great the tv show is but since I don't watch tv I decided to read it. I'll have to say I did enjoy the first book but my interest has waned with each chapter. Martin's prose is bland and his imagery seems limited for the fantasy genre. There are many fantasy novels that I'd love to see turned into a tv series but I see why this one has been chosen...it's little more than a soap opera dressed in armor. I struggled through this third installment hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel but, seriously, to end the book with lady stark coming back after her throat's been opened is, in Martin's words, a mummer's farce. I'm done with this series. This isn't fantasy writing; it's commercialism at it's finest."
5,game of thrones,"This is one of my favorite reads. I was disappointed when I moved, and found out I misplaced two of my books. I was so glad I could still get them,( first and third) wanted to read again. these are books you will read again and again."
4,Storm Swords review,"I*'m only 20% through the book, but have totally enjoyed the author's desire to bring his readers up to date on the adventures of others we have met. The world doesn't stand still for the characters."
4,Good book; not easy to navigate,"Very good book; 3rd of the series. BIGGEST complaint is that the Kindle versions of these books number the chapters with no title. Each chapter is a story related to a particular character and picks up where the last chapter on that character ended. Without chapter titles (which are character's names), it is difficult to navigate back to see what was happening to that character at the end of his/hers last chapter. Have had to make my on list of chapter names. Don't understand why the chapter titles are not included in the Kindle versions."
3,ponderous,The work is perhaps too detailed. two to three pages for a dream is a bit much and detracts from the story line. It seems that the author is being paid by the word.
3,3.5 / 5,"Clearly Martin is a major talent with a rare ability to create rich worlds, and I give Game of Thrones 4 stars, but books 2 and 3 should have been edited down about fifty percent and then combined into a single sequel. There is just way too much downtime.There are compelling stories and vibrant characters here (Tyrion, Arya, Jaime), but Martin gets bogged down in page after page of endless inner monologue, rehashing of the past, and chapters where nothing happens. Do we even need the Bran POV anymore, for instance? And the catchphrases are overdone. I get it, the Lannisters pay their debts and Jon Snow knows nothing, it was cute the first five times but by the tenth it is just painful.This series could have been truly great, but Martin fails to keep the plot as fiery as book one's."
5,Brilliant writing!,"A Storm of Swords is the third book in the series that I have read and Martin has never disappointed me ever since. The way the events in the saga turn out always surprises me and this is one of those books that however you may dislike the outcome, you always feel that it was the way things should be."
5,games to play,This book really ties together many of the relationships of previous books. It also gives you insight as to how many of these 'games' started. It is a very real depictuion of the brutality of human against human back in those days long ago.
5,melancholy,After the first part of the first book very little good happensto anyone. It is unrelentingly dark and perhapsdepressing. It is wonderfully written. It is well told.It is interesting and engaging. Just be prepared to readthousands of pages where hope remains hidden.
5,Epic saga of struggle for power is a hit . . .,"A word to the wise . . . the entire Song of Ice and Fire series of books is probably only for those who enjoy long, long epic sagas. This is a giant novel, but in this case, bigger is better. The story of the Starks and the Seven Kingdoms continues as the main characters continue their struggles for freedom in various parts of the land, even as greater threats from afar beckon. The book is extremely dense with nearly five hundred different characters (or so it seemed) and ten ""point-of-view"" characters, but it's exactly that detail which makes the book gripping and compelling. There are close to five or six plotlines going on simultaneously at all times, which makes reading the book a lot of fun and challenging at the same time. The book is filled with court intrigue, treachery, intense plotting, and smart and witty dialogue. I can't wait for the fourth book already . . . this is a terrific series."
3,Not the best,"I liked the first three books better than this fourth one. This one is rambly and a bit boring and I am eager to find out about my more favorite characters. We all are more interested in Bran, Jon and Dany. (And Tyrion!)The next book will make up for all, I'm sure.Still, all the books so far are good. Some are better than that."
1,Game of Throne (series),"Would not recommend this series. How this guy got 5 books out of this is beyond me. The only reason I kept going was because I had finished 2 of the books and figured the ending had to bring it all together. Nope. Just another murder and a dangling end. Just lots of war, suffering, burning, greed, heads on spikes. I skipped book 4 and never felt like I missed a thing."
3,"A good book, but a bit too much.","I've enjoyed all of Mr. Martin's books, but they all suffer from one overarching fault. They really should be several books rather than one. His attention seems to jump from one character to another with no rhyme or reason. There are too many stories to fit in one book."
5,Exceeds expectations,"This series gets better and better. Martin seems to have no compunction about killing off major characters--unlike Jordan, some of whose characters hang around several novels past when you wish they would die. However, this only gives Martin's storylines a sense of urgency unequalled by any of his fantasy-writing contemporaries. I somewhat ruined the novel for myself by first following only Arya's storyline, just because I couldn't stand the thought of her being killed. Don't do it, Mr. Martin! Highly recommended."
2,"Mostly enjoyed the first two, but this one is just tedious","If you read the first and last chapters of each character of this book, you'll know enough without having to dredge through tedium and dreadful chauvinism. Some give credit to his knowledge of middle ages, but I only see a lack of the sociological history. And his treatment of women...I don't see much insight into women at all. It's exhausted me to the point of not caring to finish the series."
2,Ehhh wtf,"Ok...So I LOVED the first 2 books and I understood when certain things happened to certain people and breaking molds that other fantasy series seemed to make, aka good guy always winning...but do NOT get me so emotionally involved and cheering for someone and then have them killed. Im left with ONE...ONE person I even care to read about now and thats Jon Snow. Im tempted to just start skipping the other chapters cause Im done giving a damn about everyone else, you've left me with little girls and boys and a dwarf, and some hot girl a thousand miles away that should be its own series/book as i keep feeling it just doesnt fit anymore. Im really disappointed and dont know if ill be reading the next book or even bothering with buying the new one. This book really ruined it for me, there was a line and to me this book crossed it and now the story just got utterly boring and pointless... Thanks for ruining it for me. Enjoy your series, Ill watch the first and second seasons on HBO then im done."
4,A Song of Ice and Fire series,"This is a thrilling science fiction series that has it all -- king, queens, dragon, war, love, passion. You get caught up in the action. Martin captures your interest by telling the unfolding saga through the eyes of different characters.It is a great series. I certainly hope he has finished the fifth book before I finish the fourth."
5,Books for grown-ups,"Comparing Mr. Martin to terry goodkind, robert jordan and even Tolkien is like comparing filet mignon to hot dogs(without any condiments). This is fantasy for grownups! The negative reviews are probably from all the jordanites and goodkinds. Not enough trolls or orks or other such silly things I guess."
5,The best fantasy series out there,"A Song of Ice and Fire reaches new heights with A Storm of Swords. George R.R. Martin has created an incredibly detailed world with rich characters, deep history, and unbelievable political intrigue. The latest book has more twists and turns than the Colorado River. And I sincerely wanted to find Mr. Martin and strangle him and the end of the book. I want MORE!"
3,This series is getting very very boring,"I thought the first book was interesting and well done, if not true 'high fantasy' (see my review). However, I'm finding this series seems to drone on and one in the same fashion. Each book reads exactly like the previous books. The same characters are doing the same things, thinking the same thoughts, etc etc. I actually don't mind when main characters are killed in this book because I'm so thoroughly BORED of them that killing them will at least force Martin to introduce other characters. I actually think ""Yay! So and so is dead so I won't have to read any further chapters named after them!"".This series is playing out like Dynasty/Dallas/Knot's Landing set in medieval times. Please, throw a wizard, warlock, elf, dragon, magic, etc in, George? Pretty please? If you do, we promise not to throw this series in the 'fiction' section instead of the sci/fi/fantasy section because you know something? It has absolutely no place in that section."
3,The book could use quite a bit tightening.,"After finishing this book, I can't help but wonder if Martin is getting paid for each word. Do we really need detailed description of everything (meals eaten by the characters, eg, how does that advance the story?!) And frankly, not 1/3 of the way through the book, the sex, and swearing were already getting tiresome. Yes, it's ""realistic"", we get it, enough already."
1,What a shame.,"G. Martin is a great storyteller. But he has some serious issues. A little sex and gore is fine in a fantasy novel, Martin takes it to a whole other twisted level. Incest, rape, blood, just twisted stuff. A complete waste of a talented storyteller. Ain't it a shame."
2,Kindle stopped working,I would love to write a review about this book however just when I get to the climax of the book my kindle stopped working. It is not yet 2 years old and hasn't been damaged so I am really upset about this and not sure how I am going to finish the book. Also I am just about to go on holiday and really wanted to take it with me and buy many more books to read while I am away. I am devastated. Is there something wrong with my kindle or is this just how long they are programmed to last?
1,I haven't started listening to this book yet - because they changed the actor!! BOOOO,"This is a link to Random House customer service: <...>I just sent them a message PLEADING with them to re-record it. Especially with the popularity of Game of Thrones on HBO, I would think it would be a profitable decision!! Roy Dotrice should be the ONLY actor to read this series!! (Sorry to the actor on this book, but you had impossible shoes to fill. I'm sure you would do a great job on other books.)"
2,Utterly Depressing.,"I liked the first book a lot. I even liked book two to a degree. Martin has a real nack for getting you deeply attached to the characters and he does have a very complex storyline. (Almost too complex) The main reason why I've givin this book two stars is because books are supposed to be entertaining, not depressing. When you've been enthralled with a character for over 2,500 pages and just out of the blue he or she or them (Most likely all of them) continually get killed it's very depressing. I understand that this book is supposed to be real.(as in the hero's arn't unbeatable and god like) but you can't kill every... one of them.(Where's the hope?) I got to the point where I just wanted to rip the book in two and burn it. Maybe I'll buy the next one. We still have a character or 2 I like to kill and for another... and 900 some pages it should be just a hoot-n-nanny to watch another hero die."
3,"If you are looking for an 8,000 page DOWNER, this is it.","I am halfway through the third book, some 4,000 words now. This series is amazingly well written, with good character development and a very creative plot. However, I have had enough of it as it has turned into a soap opera with all of its cliffhangers.The good guys rarely if ever win. The book has devolved into a continuous stream of negativity, amazing cruelty and brutality and unspeakable treachery. This is an interesting read but is an incredible DOWNER! Be forewarned before you start it. If you want a feel good book with a happy ending, this ain't it."
2,"Not Loanable, no text-to speech Otherwise, 2 stars","I am getting so tired of this series; too much war and killing and machismo. The narrator does a good job with his differing voices, singing and emoting that it keeps it interesting. But even if he were the greatest narrator, I have already decided the series will rate no more than 3 stars at best with the lack of Text-to-Speech and loan-ability. Just the Audible version alone is costly, the book, just an e-book, is costly too. That is the most insulting thing an author or publisher could do. I doubt it is the author. By the way, I do think the author can weave a great story, Just not my kind of story. I will continue to read/listen to the rest of this series if only to be able to hold my own when my adult children or others discuss it."
5,Never has there been anything better,"George R.R. Martin is a fantsy prodigy. He has done the near-impossible: created a whole new world -- from top to bottom. Millions of people, thousands of places, tons upon tons of history. And every t's crossed and every i's dotted. This man didn't miss a thing. He plays by reality. None of this Faerie Comes to the Rescue bit. If you fall off a mountain-you fall. No faeries to save you and no magic to make you come back to life. Your dead. This is his reality (altough I must admit there is one exception, but my lips are sealed) and it's worth staying up till 3:00 to finish it. My sister actually introduced me to the Song of Fire and Ice series, and I loved it. And--this'll really throw you for a loop--Im 13. It just goes to show that age and reading has no corospondence whatsoever, and never let the size of a book throw you off, 'cause if you stay on, you're in for the ride of you're life. And with A Storm of Swords, that's exactly what you'll get."
5,Fantastic Read,I'm going to keep this short. This book is one of the best fantasy books ever written. It is a great installment to the series and does not disappoint...I wish the same could be said for A Feast For Crows.
3,Nice reading,"The story is nice. Not so fast-paced as the first, but still good. I recomend it specially for fantasy stories fans."
5,Keeps You going,"Although a 3erd book, this novel still keeps you interested in those characters you have learnt to love at the beginning. Or hate."
5,brilliant,This has to be my favorite out of the series so far. A Storm of Swords is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I keep running my kindle down trying to finish reading it!
5,Absolutly riveting!,I was shocked how fast I read this book. The story flows effortlessly and the intrigue is masterfully written!
4,As good as the first two.,"The only reason this set doesn't earn 5 stars from me is Martin's tendency to confuse the story with just too many families, clans and characters."
5,Great Book,"Keeps you reading, can't put down. If you watch the TV show it really helps to know the all the names and places. Love this series."
5,Good but overly descriptive,Fills in a lot of gaps. Great plot twists. I feel like the author fills up a lot of pages on describing food or scenery that after reading hundreds of pages feels a bit tedious. Overall definitely recommend!
4,Love it...But...,"I love this book. I love this series! However, this book especially was VERY heavy on details. I love that I can picture every single thing in George RR Martin's head but this one is so steeped in detail I can tell you what color thread is in the clothing of every character. So be prepared to slog through a very detail oriented fun adventure ride."
3,Love in Decline,"There is a lot of time invested in reading 3 LONG books. I gave the first 5 stars. This one 3. The writing is good. Is it that good? Must be, because I have determined to push on to the end. Martin's dark vision grows even darker. A bleak winter is coming, yet can it get bleaker?The stories of many of the characters are captivating, although it becomes more difficult to believe that they will all be weaved together into a satisfying conclusion. But then, it may be that Martin's imagined world is more a nightmare than a coherent dream.Still, we devotees soldier on.False Prophet, a Legal Thriller"
5,"The more I read, the more I get hooked!","Another brilliant book in George R.R. Martin's hugely entertaining and successful A Song of Ice & Fire saga.I had avoided the fantasy genre for many years, after overdosing on Marion Zimmer Bradly when a teen and not wanting to repeat the experience.For me, this is on a par with Tolkien's Lord of the Ring saga or maybe even better."
4,My review,"I really enjoyed this book. However, some of the lists of people who did various things was a bit boring. If I hadn't wanted to find out what happened to the individuals, I would have quit reading it."
5,A great story,Have just started the last book in the series and looking forward to the film.Also have had to watch the movie again as the story is just fantastic.
3,A bit dragging...,"After a long wait, ASoS was finally available in the book stores in the Netherlands. But only in Trade Paperback, which I very much regretted. With the highest expectations I started reading, and I must admit, I was disappointed. The book is really good, but slightly slower than the first two. GRRM is still very original in his style of fantasy, the dark flavor, the sense of dread, knowing that there might not be a happy ending is great, but this third part was just an elaboration on the second. The only really surprising part was indeed the very ending, but that left me with a sour depressed feeling. The book is not as good as the others, but I hope that the other three will be better and this third book was only a sort of ""shifting of focus""."
5,5 stars or you're confused.......,"This book was incredible. The only thing I've ever read that could equal it, the first two. I'm now ripping the pages out of the wheel of time for toilet paper....... Buy this book."
5,My question,"When will this book be released in true paperback?I have the previous 2 books in paperback, and want to match them all up in my collection. Trade paperback is nice, but doesn't fit on my bookshelf."
1,What A Bore - I Give Up,"I started reading Game of Thrones on vacation. Book 1 was a good pot-boiler story - lots of pretentious writing, bodice ripping and gore. The overall plot moves at a very slow pace but there are lots of side stories and episodes t oenjoy along the way. Starting on book 2 we got more of the same.It took me til book three to realize this is not a novel, it is a soap opera on paper. It's just one story after another of screwing, getting screwed and finding new and grisly ways to kill off characters. About a third of a way through book three I gave up. If you want a soap opera with swords and magic, then this book is for you. But if you're looking for a novel with a coherent setting, an actual plot, and characters you actually can give a crap about, then keep looking."
4,Amazing,"Twists and turns, and new characters. I just can't stop reading. Only problem is I look forward to book 4, but reviews are less than I expected at this juncture in the storyline. Oh well, can't stop now because I know my favorite characters will return in book 5, so onward I go."
4,Stunning,"Martin blindsides you in this book I don't want to spoil it by saying more, but at one point I put the book down in disbelief. Great story..."
5,"Martin""s ""Storm of Swords""","A little slow getting started, but it got better and better all the way through. Martin is amazing in how he keeps you mezmorized with all the characters he presents and their experiences. My son is now reading it and he can't put it down."
5,The best one so far!,"I believe that this is the largest book in the series and it seemed to take forever to read but every moment was enjoyable. Fighting for the throne has calmed down a good deal in this book while everyone is licking there wounds and replanning their attacks. We get to read in Jaime's perspective, how I hated him in the first two books, and now I actually kind of like him. George R.R. Martin kills off quite a few of his main characters in this book. One of which I had been wishing for all along. That alone makes it worth reading this book. A couple of others I was SHOCKED about but I guess you cannot get too close to these characters. This book is so far my favorite in the series."
4,"Book three but its not the end, as I thought when I started this series!","I received the first book as a gift from they son, actually bought bokks two and three, finished them, reread all of them due to time between books. Then actually bought them for my kindle. How dumb is this!"
5,"As brilliant as the first two were, they existed to set this book up.","I don't have much new to say that hasn't been shouted many times before in these reviews. I agree with nearly every bit of praise. His love for the characters is more clear here than ever before. Besides Sansa, I can't think of a single ""main"" character that I can't wait to read about. And Jaime! (small spoiler) - Martin can turn a character I despised into one I cheered for... truly a master storyteller and the finest fantasy writer of our age."
5,Absolutely incredible...,"...but it will be absolute torture waiting for book four.This book, amazingly, was actually _better_ than the preceding two. Mr. Martin is without a doubt the most enrapturing fantasy writer I've ever had the privilege to read."
5,fantastic,"There is no certainity when you read Martin's series of books--A Song of Ice and Fire. You will find yourself favoring certain characters only to find them killed off. We have been conditioned to believe when we read a book or watch a movie that the main characters, be it the hero or herione or such, are immune to extreme adversity, yet our heros and heriones of Martin's books have no such immunity.Like always, Martin moves from chapter to chapter switching from the persepective of different characters. Some are good, some bad, all are shown as being human with human faults. You can't help but have favorites. My favorites have been the same since book one--Jon and Arya. I can't help but skip through chapters to see how long I will have to wait before I'll get to read more. Now I have to wait for book four.Overall, excently written."
2,The series is slowing down,Martin the champion of useless window dressing. This book starts his useless page filling in earnest. The exciting climax of this book has about four pages of copy in his next book. What a let down!
5,Fantastic Book,"This is really a fantastic book and probably the best one of the series (so far)! The characters, the setting and the writing is just great and I can't wait to see what the show does the material in this book!"
5,books on cd,Love this reader he is great to listen to and brings the story alive. I enjoy these books as well.
5,Best of the Series,"The twist and turns in this book are mind blowing, things that you think are going to happen go in a completely different direction"
5,Storm of Swords,Just read the Prologue I'm not kidding I couldn't read anymore. I wanted that chapter to sizzle for a night.What a Series
2,The greatest? Whatever..,"OK.. I've read all these reviews, and I don't get it. Every one of the books in this series practically bored me to tears. Not only that, but you have trouble rooting for anyone in particular because there are so many characters trying to take the throne. Just when you start to root for a character, Martin runs off and beheads him. He's basically wasted thousands of pages to write something he could have wrote in half of that. I'm imagining this guy basically has no clue how the series is going to end up, so he's just writing a big blob of nothing.. Is there even a point to this series?!He should have made the entire series one big book, I'd have felt better. Obviously several others do not feel this way. So I suppose you have to read for yourself. He's good, but not that good."
3,Dissatisfied,"I enjoyed the complexity, depth, and unpredictability, but Martin did a poor job tying up plot threads. The thought provoking epilogue didn't compensate enough for the dissatifying ending. I am looking forward to the 4th book."
1,Sick writer ..DONT READ,"This write is so sick of mind that i think its a crime to let him live free, he should be in one of the mental asylum.DONT READ THIS BOOK."
3,Better than Tolkien.,"Now doubt, a well written and thought out book, but better than Tolkien... no. Tolkien was, is, and always will be the master of the fantasy genre. Martin has writen a great series but like many of todays' authors, he has not learned when to end a good series. I am bored of folowing multiple story lines with too many sub sub plots. I am stretched to my limit of focus with having to turn back fifty pages to remember who is who and who did what to whom. The simple beauty of Tolkies was... is I never read the Hobbit of Books I & II of The Lord of The Rings, I could read Book III and not be lost. But as I said before... The Song of Fire and Ice is a enjoyable series... but no where near Tolkien."
2,"I don't know what book they were reading, but","This whole series has been extremely long winded, ill edited, and an attempt at either soft porn or fantasy, and coming up short on at least the fantasy aspect. The story line is good, however, it is lost in a deluge of side stories that does nothing but water down the story line. A good editor could have pulled the same story together in 1/2 the pages. Martin must of been getting paid the old IBM programming way- by the line. Better then Tolkien? I think not."
3,Storm of Awords,"I started the Martin series as I read he was ""like a modern day Tolkien"". Sadly this is far from accurate. After reading 3 of his series I came to the conlcusion he just likes to write. The story ramble on so much I lost interest in thinking about where it might be going. This 3rd book is a 1000 pages of rambling story line. It has its good moments and the imagination that went into the concept is very good. Let's leave it this way, there is still one more book in the series of 4 and I will not read it. When I read the trilogy by Tolkien I couldn't wait to read the last one. It is really too bad as his concept and creativity were great."
5,Awesome!!!,"This Book is by far the best of the series so far. Mr. Martin's ability to captivate the read is unmistakable. I would recommend ""A Song of Fire & Fire"" Series to anyone who likes fantasy. Theses Books are AWESOME!! HANDS DOWN!!"
1,Don't believe the hype,"Of Martin's 3 books in this series, I've never been so disappointed. He does weave the plot together rather well, but it was predictable. He spends too much time in detail of characters he never saw fit to elaborate on until he needed some more characters because he's killed off all the other main characters. There was only 1 surprise in the book and it was the very end, and I mean very end. This book was quite easy to put down and full of disappointments for me from such a talented author."
1,"Come on, what a disappointment","Why do the authors in the fantasy have this new 'cool trend' of writing huge 'epic' series filled basically with subplots and only a nebulous main theme?All the so-called 'fantasy kings'- Jordan, Terry Goodkind and now GRR Martin have disappointed me greatly. The 'epic' style is very unsatisfactory, more like a soap opera than an epic. Tolkien wrote epic and grand stories, but were they neverending, rambling creations? I had more hopes for this particular series but the author appears to be squandering it away with another Jordan-like fiasco. If you want tightly woven, well-written fantasy, don't expect to be satisfied here. Look at Pullman's provocative and beautiful His Dark Materials, or Ursula K Leguin's thoughtful trilogy. Or go back to the major figure in the genre, Tolkien, and see why these authors are worth reading. These books are more like Swords-and-sorcery Grisham then fantasy. The genre really is going downhill."
2,Too dark,"In the first two books it was refreshing, but it steadily got worse. Now we've reached my tolerance level. In this book I have to say there is something to disgust all of mankind in some way: Depravity, death on a large scale, death on a small scale described intensely, Necromancy, horrible treachery, likeable characters destroyed as a matter of course, CHILDREN becoming killers...I've had enough.I'll just say one more thing, once I agreed with people who said Robert Jordan was a chicken using ""immortal"" main characters etc. No longer. I completely and totally support that style of writing after reading this book. I'm going to get volume 10 of the Wheel of Time and LOVE EVERY PAGE OF IT!"
3,disappointing sequel,What a disappointing way to continue this great sequel. All of your favorite characters are wiped out. And the occasional spatter of sex takes a raunchy turn. This is the last book of Martin's that I will read.
1,"A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)","Please do not buy this book, it rambles on for 900 painful pages. The first 2 books were good even with all the players but this one hits the bottom of the barrel and then failed to give an ending. Failure of ending a book is getting to be an epidemic with today's fantasy writers.As I read the book there were good parts but just about everybody I liked gets killed. I told my wife every time I read the Storm of Swords book, the first 2 books were good, this one has to get better. It never did."
1,Too much hissing,"After reading so many positive reviews, I was very exited when I recieved this cd in the mail. I popped it in my bose wave radio, turned it up to 85, and listened to the most annoying hissing sound I've ever heard coming from my system. I regret purchasing this cd."
5,Desert island disc...,"I really like Reiner's reading of ""Music for strings, percussion and celesta"", but... the ""Concerto for orchestra"" is simply phenomenal, both musically and sonically (the recording is crystal clear). I guess this would definitely be one of my ""desert island discs""..."
3,Worth Buying !,Suggested having more cards for different nations and it'd be much better if the country's names could be printed at the card back as it is not easily to make a guess.
1,"overrated and too narcissistic ,and maybe megalomaniac anthony bourdain","I like the sardinian documentary best ,with his first wife (she is sardinian too) the tuscany and vietnam are good , many other documentaries are just about gloryfing himself and I don't like that he humiliates everybody in those countries. his worse 2 documentaries absolutely are in Rome ,nobody made Rome look so bad like him .a 2.700 years old city with immense history he made it look like crap,shame on anthony bourdain ,the worse documentaries ever about the extremely beautiful and historical ROME.I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HIM his extreme political views that shouldn't belong in travel and food shows, especially in the LONDON show where he say he would like to see the royals dragged on the street and thrown feces at them , well anthony bourdain deserves feces thrown at him."
2,Pass this book,"I find this book to be dry and boring. It was hard to stay interested when it went back and forth from past to present. It is different, yet the author didn't make good transitions when she went from present to past then back to the present. This book would have been written better and a good tone if the past history was done in prologue and the present afterwards. The book did give a sense of hot and cold relationship between Honoria and James as well as the past and the present. Yet it is hard to believe Honoria's love for James at the end, when throughout the book she couldn't stand him and disliked him.My advice, buy it used if you have to, it's not worth the full price you pay for it. I couldn't read this book a second time, so not much of a keeper. This is more of a drama/fiction book than romance."
3,A Sequel That Does Not Quite Make It...,"Having read so many of her delightful other books, I was bored and disappointed with this sequel, which would have been better left unwritten. Part of the problem was the style, choppy going back and forth from a recent past to present. If she had told that story first and then proceeded, it might have been more interesting. Unlike her other novels, this one lacked pace and riveting plot lines. It repetitively focused on the heroine's coldness and desire not to be wed, and her former lover's equal insistence that they would be. Other books are far better, such as Wings of the Storm, After the Storm, etc. Was her editor sleeping?"
3,Who Asked For An Encore Of The Price Of Innocence?,"On its own, ON A LONG AGO NIGHT is a pretty decent story of a long-ago-pirate-in-Middle-East-loves-me love story rekindled in Regency England. There are some great tender emotional scenes between the two, but frankly, it is too similar to previous book THE PRICE OF INNOCENCE for comfort.Hero and heroine meet and have a very mad affair. Then they part and now they meet again in ballroom, each of them now rich and titled. He breaks into her bedroom, she screams at him to get out,................."
3,Too choppy and uninteresting for the first 200 pages,"I read in other reviews that there were a lot of flashbacks to in this book to 8 years ago. That's something that usually doesn't bother me; it creates suspense and another storyline. Not in this book. The flashbacks did not create an anxiousness to get back to the main storyline, they were just annoying interruptions to a story that was already barely holding my interests. It created a very choppy feeling in the book. I felt like I was reading two separate books and neither one was holding my attention well.I persevered and finished the book and by the end the flashbacks felt more natural and the story had finally involved me enough to care what happened both during the flashbacks and when they ended.That's why I gave the book 3 stars, because I did care by the end, but it took over 200 to get there."
4,"Thank you, thank you, thank you.....",While waiting for my favorite authors to write their next books I pick up authors I haven't read before. After three months of waiting for something decent to read I finally found it. This book held my interest to the end. The storyline was quite good and I liked the way the author told James and Honoria's past. The author gave Honoria a strong personality and she carried it well through the book - she said what was on her mind and after what she had been through 8 years ago she had every right to behave as she did. Ms. Sizemore did a nice job with this book and I thank her for bringing me out of my slump of bad authors.
1,LOL~!!!,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL"
5,Best I've seen so far...,"For those who enjoyed the purely action aspect of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this movie is a MUST SEE for you. Those who rely solely on plot, story development, romance etc. might not be quite as pleased, but don't be dismayed. The fight scenes they pulled off in this one were surreal. Words alone don't do this movie justice, you must see it and decide for yourself..."
5,iron monkey dvd * donnie yen,"This movie is one of the all time best!. All the action was cho reographed by Yuen Woo Ping. Aka as the fight scenes choreographer for the Matrix (keanu reeves), and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."
3,OK,"This movie along with all other kung fu movies from this time are great. However, because they were made such a long time ago, I see no benefit in purchasing the Bluray version of it (not crystal clear like a currently made movie). I recommend that if the movie is cheaper in regular DVD format then that is the way to go."
2,wait for the us theatrical version on dvd - its much better,stay away from the official hong kong/japanese dvd. it is not as good as the us theatrical release of iron monkey. the us version has better sound effects and the image was remastered to improve color and remove artifacts. the background music was also updated on the us release. i suggest waiting for the us version on dvd. i hope they release it soon.
4,A Donnie Yen Gem,"Iam a huge fan of martial arts i have seen hundreds of kung fu films and own around 50. I dont own iron monkey becuase you can easily rent it from any video rental store in your area. But i have seen Iron monkey over 5 times. Now that Iron Monkey is being released in North America many are going to compare this naturally to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. But they are different, if you want to see a crazy wire assisted kung fu flick with less plot and more action well this is the movie for you. But if you want an epic like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, when fighting is secondary then you might not like this one. Also this movie goes back to the roots of Kung Fu with classic fist like the Shaolin Wonder palm, and many other Shaolin and wu shu associated fights. Donnie Yen proves in this movie that Martial Arts doesnt only have to be about Jackie Chan And Jet Li, and this might be the breakout movie for Donnie Yen who is choreagraphing the fights for Wesly Snipes in blade 2."
4,Fantastic movie.,"Another writer said to wait for the US version, but I would recommend against this. The US version has been re-edited by the morons at Miramax who seem to think that the fight scenes needed to be shorter. Yes, it has better sound and image quality, which is great. But when they cut the fight scenes down I would rather take poor subtitles, bad image quality, and not so great sound effects than an incomplete version. Tarentino ... you should be ashamed of himself for letting them touch it."
4,good wire-fu,"Tsui Hark produced this Yuen Woo-ping martial arts adventure depicting the exploits of a Chinese Robin Hood known as the Iron Monkey. Here, Wong Key-ying, played by Donnie Yen, is assigned by the government to take down the Iron Monkey, but not before collaborating with his intended target in order to take down the government themselves. Acclaimed by enthusiasts as the definitive modern martial arts movie, this film contains excellent wire fu choreography by Yuen Woo-ping, star turns by Donnie Yen and Yu Rong-guang, and some decent, if not annoying, slapstick humor. Recommended to anyone in need of a good, old fashioned wire fu movie. DVD contains original, wide screen aspect ratio. The transfer is clear and sounds amazing in Dolby Digital. If you can, get it on DVD instead of VHS."
4,Too Fast,"If you are to see this movie, definetely see the one in chines with the english subtitiles. The movie alone had an interesting plot, awesome weaponry, and some cool fight scenes. If you liked crouching tiger hidden dragon, you wont find too much of a difference in the fighting scenes in Iron Monkey. The movie starts out with this dude, who just jumps around like a monkey(hey, go figure) and he jumps on peoples heads, etc. Now if you dont like the unrealistic fighting, dont see this movie, i by other hand, hate just regular fighting movies, i love the jumping from wall to wall. Chinese dubbing will always suck, so get the one with subtitles, the movie isnt for its amazing lines!"
3,"Fun, and almost spectacular, but...","... am I the only person on the planet whp thinks that the action scenes are just ridiculously, comically undercranked? I mean, to the point where it actually undermines the thrill factor because it plays more like a fast-motion silent comedy than it does like action. It kind of ruined the whole thing for me."
4,A Very good Kung Fu Movie,"Good guy, bad guys, kung-fuie action all the way. I would recommend to any martial arts follower.A very good plot."
1,Doesn't fit well as a Once apon a time in china prequel,Disapointing. This movie has Huang fei Hong doing things with a pole he cant even do as an adult.
2,...'thumbs up'??? what kinda janky ish is ebert anem on??...,...i had more fun watchin the fat boys in 'disorderlies'...the fight scenes in this didnt even get a lil bit raw until near the end of the movie...the plot is jus straight up corny...i bought this expectin somethin CLOSE to being called 'entertaining'...but this was jus sorry...does the 'u.s.a.-cable channel' still show they kung-fu flicks on sundays? because that woulda been a whole lot better...I BOUGHT THIS!!?!?!??!? i gotta leave the likka alone...yall be good....
1,we dont need the new editor.,"Why re-edit a perfect film?. Just tried to watch this on Netflix and some twit over colour-corrected, cut select nuances, destroyed the mood of delicate scenes; Miss Orchid' flash-back sequence has an overtly blue filter - it ruined an excelently shot and lit sequence. Don't buy this version, it looks like a bad pirate copy and has been completely ruined. The original had faults, yes; like someone throwing leaves in front of a stage fan - it was the films entirity that gave it charm, a certain cinematic grace, kung-fu sonund-effects and all. Even the faults in the original were good faults. FIND THE ORIGINAL. They even took out the original musical score !?. Then replaced it with something that sounds like it was ""torented"" from a pirate copy of Final Cut Pro STUDENT-VERSION. STOP RUINING EXCELLENT FILMS. Your mother may love your perspective, WE DON'T."
3,Nothing extraordinary here,"Personally, I don't think there's anything particularly noteworthy here. The film is okay but ultimately forgettable."
5,Best Movie Ever,"The movie Iron Monkey was not only one of the best martial arts movies of all time, but one of the best overall movies of all time. Most people haven't seen it because Jackie Chan nor Jet Li is on the front cover; they don't need to be. This movie is better than anything Jet Li ever did, and almost better than anything Jackie Chan ever did (and I say this as a hardcore Jackie Chan fan, and hardcore Jet Li fan). Iron Monkey has, literally, non-stop action. ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!"
4,...man enough to admit it...,"on a previous review, i really dissed this movie... the entire thing just felt cheesy to me and the folks who recommended it over-emphasized the story against the one from 'crouching tiger'... but finally, i was able to sit back, clear my head of all previous (mis-)conceptions and watch this thing...and you know what?it aint too bad after all... my mistake yall... forgive me!now... i aint gonna bend over and call this thing a 'classic', but i'm glad i held onto it for awhile and didnt sell it!"
4,What is it with Monkeys?,"This is my first review so apologies if it sucks. I purchased a few martial arts movies recently and while some were a waste of money Iron Monkey is brilliant! The story is ok, not brilliant but not the worst I have seen either. The choreography of the martial arts is however excellent! Sure some of it is far fetched, but overall it is done so well you just don't care. I bought this movie at the same time as ""Evil Cult"" and there is no comparison between the two. Evil Cult looked lame beside Iron Monkey.If you are looking for some of the best martial arts I have seen for a while this is a must buy!"
4,"The poor, the bad and the Monkey","Some time ago in old CantonCorruption filled the townSo Iron Monkey robbed the richAnd let it trickle downThe police force? A laughing stockThe Governor? A thief!Martial arts the Monkey usedTo give the poor reliefOne day a stranger came to townHis young son right behindBlackmailed by the GovernorThe Monkey he must findAs movies go, the two combineAfter a bit of fussThey fight the ugly, and the bad(That’s good enough for us)The final showdown is a thrillAnd not one you should missIf Crouching Tiger made you gaspYou need to sit for thisAmanda Richards, December 17, 2005"
5,Iron Monkey,"I love this movie! Its absolutely amazing and stunning! The flying and fighting scenes and wire-fu surpasses Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon! Nice fighting scenes! Donnie Yen's Chinese Boxing style was amazing! And Orchid kicks [BUTT]! The part with her beating up those guys in that warehouse place was awesome! Nice grappling hand she did! If you buy Iron MOnkey, dont buy the new version they just released in America, because I heard they cut off some fighting that was in the Chinese version from the American version!"
4,Awesome Wire-Fu!!,"This movie is definetly some serious wire-fu, but really fun and really entertaining the whole way through. The pure kung-fu in it is very good and very well choreographed. Yuen Woo Ping is awesome and really put something great together here. Donnie Yen is also terrific in this version of Iron Monkey. (There are several other versions) This is definetly the best version to date. I am a big fan of Crouching Tiger and I think that this might have surpassed it.A good mix of hardcore kung-fu and wire-fu/fantasy kung-fu. And the wire work doesn't take away from the hardcore kung-fu either. A great and very entertaining film. Directed very well and acted beautifully. Pick this one up!"
3,action,No one I know watches a martial arts film for plot and this one has as skinny a one as any of them. What it has loads of is action. The leads are amazingly athletic and the fight scenes call upon all their artistry. It is a feast for the eyes. Yes there is wire work - lots of it and done well.
5,A great Martial Arts Action Packed Primer Movie!,This Martial Arts Tale is pure off the chair entertainment. I highly recommend this film for those who have heard of the excitement that the Martial Arts movies of Hong Kong bring. This movie will grab your interest or it won't (please check your pulse). This movie features great characters. The skill set of the star cast is impeccable. A must for Martial Arts movie collectors and buffs. A great introduction for those who are interested in great action.
3,A good film ruined by special effects,"Donnie Yen is an incredibly talented martial artist and this movie goes a long way to proving that. Unfortunately some of the action is speeded up to the point that it's quite laughable - no idea why because the guy's just unbelievable at normal speed! And there's too much wire work - people defying gravity - for me. The story's nothing special, the acting a little above the usual Hong Kong fare, but the bad guy's can really kick butt and there are some great gems in and amongst the fight scenes. Definitely one of the better HK flicks, just not one of the best."
4,Good Movie,"I thought this movie was going to be another one of those low budget cheesy fight scene movies. BUT, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. The fight scenes were well coreographed, and there was a pretty good plot to the movie. Once the fighting started, the movie didn't slow down much at all. A movie you can watch more than once."
5,JUST A GOOD MOVIE,"This is simply just a good movie. It plays into the mysteries of the martial art world, that we are all captivated by, without getting carried away with the special effect (as some of our favorites have a tendency to do). So get some snacks then stretch out on that fluffy couch and enjoy the show. Watch out for them buddhist palms out there."
4,your kung fu is very powerful,"Crouching Tiger, without the tragedy, this movie rocks. A kung fu blast with lengthly and very energetic fight scenes. Actors are dubbed. None of the beautiful scenery of Crouching Tiger this movie is a chinese robin hood set in a city. No awful violence just some good ... whupping until the final bad guy. Good fighting by the female heroine and kid."
1,Stick to an import,Ok so this is one of the greatest Kung Fu movies ever made yet if you buy this version you might as well be insulting the film. Find the original online somewhere as what they did to this makes me ashamed to be a westerner.
2,Horrible.,"I grew up in the US but I lived in Hong Kong for about 3 years of my life combined, and have watched many Kung Fu movies. This is anything but a quality movie. Most people from the usa really only care about the fighting parts and the rest (which would be qualified as bad acting and horrible story) they don't really pay attention to being its a asian film, and ""thats the way their movies are"" well I can tell you this film is HORRIBLE. Just because it is a Kung Fu movie does not mean it doesn't have to have a story or decent actors.The subtitles are lacking and look as if a 12 year old wrote them(I loved the subtitle ""steaming iron"" for when the kid got marked) and the voice overs were actually done by 12 year olds. If you want a quality Kung FU movie watch ""hero"". If you watch this movie not caring about horrible acting or horrible story do not call yourself a movie buff. BAD ACTING, BAD STORY, PRETTY BAD FIGHTING. D- I only gave it 2 stars because... I fealt like it."
5,cutting edge evolutionary biology,"Shuster and Wade provide a comprehensive review of the most up to date science regarding sexual selection and mating strategies. This is an advanced book, and may be a bit heavy for readers new to sexual selection, but I would say it is a must read for graduate students and professional scientists interested in evolutionary biology. The conceptual framework presented in this book will most certainly allow for advancement of the discipline."
3,"Good songs, nice idea,","Chita Rivera sounds a bit old on this recording. Her voice lacks the bite of her other roles. But the music is good and the songs are entertaining. Of course, the show is supposed to be camp. But the song ""Russian Movie"" does do well with Rivera's voice on the recording. Perhaps it played better on the stage."
2,KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN,"The reason I only marked this with 2 stars is not because of the quality of the CD (or lack thereof) but for the fact that it was sent to me without a case so that it was totally exposed to everything with the possibility of being damaged in transit...not to mention the fact that it is completely inconvenient to have a CD without a case to keep it in...I don't know why this was done but I highly recommend that it not been done in the future or if the person sending it insists on continuing to do this he be kind enough to inform potential purchasers ahead of time...for myself, had I known, I would have purchased it from someone else..."
1,A Deadly Kiss,"I might be biased because I bought Vanessa William's version before this one, but it simply doesn't do it for me. The entire second cast of this magnificent Kander & Ebb collaboration is way superior to the original."
4,The Greenes,"This book really appealed to me and my family. We are all Southern Gospel Music fans and this tells a warm, descriptive story of a family who has faced difficult crisis, overwhelming victory and medical struggles with grace and faith.Greenes' fans will especially enjoy this book. However, anyone would be inspired by reading this volume.Order it today and I think you'll be glad you did."
5,Good entertainment.,"I received the CD within excellent time after ordering it, and enjoyed the movie throughly. I enjoy watching older movies, so I am pleased to recommend both the services and movies offered here."
5,Repeat?,"I love the FG guide, but was disappointed due to the fact that The FG Guide to Life is the exact same book as Grace Under Pressure --- literally word for word -- just a different title."
4,D'Molls - Warped,"I had never heard of this band before, but one day I heard one of their songs on my Sirius XM stereo in my car. I liked the song, so I looked up the band and bought this album and liked it."
4,"Look for effectiveness, not brand","I am a member or a large Italian family. We use grated cheese on many things - soup, pasta, polenta, and in general, you name it. For years I owned a metallic ""Mouli"" grinder - which failed a number of years ago, and I could not find a replacement that I liked. I purchased a Zyliss grinder then and had good luck with it until it warped - unsure of how. I purchased another brand (a name in kitchen appliances) that would not measure up to the Zyliss. I bought another Zyliss, it is every bit as good as before. Even with heavy use, I strongly recommend this cheese grinder."
5,Just Like The Resaurant,Quality grater. I am pleased with the function and ease of use. You wont be disappointed with this choice. Roll Tide
1,COMPLETELY OUTDATED!,"Nowhere is there a warning on this product that it is NOT COMPATIBLE with any Mac OS developed after the California gold rush. It takes OS 6 or 7 just to play and then you still have to set your monitor on 8-bit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this disc, or this company for that matter. Stuff like that needs to be explained up front!"

3,Modest prdouction values but high Erika content!,"This advertizes as being in the spirit of 'Charlies Angels' and 'The X-files' but is a low budget affair throughout. 3 sisters return home at X-mas only to find their 4th murdered and they want to know why. The 4 do not even remotely look related but if you are an Erika Eleniak fan, she gets lots to do and delivers her lines with professional zeal throughout."
3,Vegas: City Of Dreams??,"When I got this film, I bought Four Dogs Playing Poker as a Amazon.com deal. Vegas: City of Dreams had a very interesting plot in the beginning of the film but it slowly declined. I felt like I was watching a soft-core porno-soap. It seems casting wasn't the best... they probably went to every strip joint in Vegas and said to every stripper, ""Hey, ya want to be in a movie?"" I am a huge John Taylor fan and I was thrilled to hear he got one of the lead roles, but I was very disappointed because his acting wasn't the best. If you are a down-right fan of one of the actors in the movie, buy it... but don't buy it out of curiousity. Sorry, John."
3,"Eleniak,Brenda Doumani, Rossi and Tessiero","Movie was ok could have been MUCH better, Erika Eleniak was great as always, and Brenda Epperson Doumani is definitely right up there with Eleniak, it was great to see Steve Rossi from the old comedy team of Allen and Rossi his performance was excellent, the director should have capitalized on one of his cast members Michael A. Tessiero, needed to see more of him, this guy is turning up everywhere , has great screen presents, can't put him in a scene with any leading men though, if you do viewers will be wondering why Tessiero is not the star. All in all it was entertaining."
3,"Good product, some cracks","I have been using this set for about a month. There are a couple of cracks in the outside layer of two of the forks. This is weird. The rest of the set is fine. I don't put them in the dishwasher and I dry them immediately after washing with a towel, because I hate stains. I don't see how these could possibly crack like this. Hopefully, it's just these two."
1,Not a good purchase!,After ordering I was very disappointed! I will be sending these back ASAP! I can picture one of my small kids hurting themselves on the sharp corners! Do not buy this flatware...
4,Nice,Nice long knives. Long knives reach into the bottom of jars! Large size forks and spoons but not overly large. all in all I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.
1,not good,"this product is highly flawed. this dynamic immersion technique may work on easier languages like spanish or french but not difficult languages like pashto. The software works like this, your shown pictures which you must match with phrases. its easy at first, your given a picture of a ball a cat a dog and so on, you have to match the word (in pashto) to the picture. then the pictures and phrases get much more comlicated, the software doesnt tell you what the pictures really mean. one picture shows a boy climbing into an airplane, i thought it meant just that, but the real translation is a boy and an airplane, but there is no way for you to know. I also remember learning the alphabet first when learning a new language. It would have been great if i knew how to pronounce each letter correctly but the software starts off with words. it would have been a great learning software if it gave you the actual translation of the picture. Its good software if you have a tutor and some books."
2,Dissappointment.,"This is one of the most dissappointing albums I have ever purchased. Horowitz's rushed, unemotional, and steadfastly staccatto style make this recording of great technical merrit, but little of enjoyment to the ear. The cadenza chosen by the player is not the most impressive of the two (ossia and regular) and his justification, as outlined in the booklet of the cover, is weak. One can imagine Rachmaninoff's reference to Horowitz snapping up the piece to be a subtle dissapproval rather than a comment of praise."
5,Highly Addictive,"As you listen to Johnny Thunders you will find yourself saying he sounds a little like the Ramones, T-Rex, the Velvet Underground, the Dolls.... Then you come to the realization that Johnny Thunders sounds like Johnny Thunders. What an interesting career and sound, sadly cut way too short. After buying this album I found myself greatly desiring all the recordings he has done. You will also see just how influential he was."
5,So good I am ordering the DVD (already have the tape),"All I can say is WOW. After tiring of the same old Summer Blockbuster garbage films (you know, the film bites but it made 300 mil at the box office so it must be a success) it was nice to see a refreshing original non-formulated film. I picked this film up on VHS at Blockbuster and am pre-ordering the DVD I liked it so much."
4,Where would you go if you were lost and alone and couldn't go home....,"This movie is so realistic and eerie and well-made. It's about this teenage delinquient who escaped from juvie and he really has no where to go. The movie follows him as he embarks on a surrealist, dream-like journey throuh the city, encountering people and running and hiding from the police. The ending is somewhat ambigious, but I guess it's the correct ending for this movie. I'd recommend it to fans of well-made, award-worthy independent movies. It's not the best out there, but certainly not the worst..."
2,Disapointing veterans but ok for newbies on SC,"I must disagree with the other reviewers. The game isn't designed for the PSP, the gameplay and story aren't bad at all, but there are very important features Ubisoft dev team didn't had in their mind and they should. The PSP isn't a game console with a good ""outdoors"" screen and this game should came to players with ""Game Brightness Level"" as option, and there isn't nothing, that makes very hard (impossible) to play outside (unless at night) only if you use Sam's night vision (but not always avaiable during the game). Joining this with the dificult game camera movement, makes the gameplay dificult. We know Splinter Cell relays on Sam's missions ""on the shadow"" but the brightness are essencial on the PSP and this game don't make the PSP fun to use. For that big mistake I give only 2 stars and I advice to try the game before you buy it."
4,From a first time PSP gamer.,"I just recently bought Splinter Cell Essentials. Bear in mind that I'm a Splinter Cell fan so my review tends to be pretty favorable of the game. I'm not too far into the game unfortunately, but the game seems to be relatively fun. I'm definitely liking the heat/night vision goggles (better than the console versions). The missions seem to be long, but with plenty of checkpoint as well as a ""save anytime"" feature. This helps to reduce those moments where you go ""Oh crap."" when you turn the game off to run to a class. So far my only complaints are the game is very dark so the NVG/Heat becomes almost mandatory for the entire game. Other than that, I love the game. Pick it up if you're a Splinter Cell fan, otherwise just wait around till it goes down in price."
1,Terrible Port,"I LOVE Splinter Cell games - have been playing them for years. Therefore, the day I bought my first PSP, this was one of the first games I picked-up. It was a severe let down (as have been all UbiSoft games for the PSP). There are numerous broken aspects of this game. The one I remember the most was that the graphics were so bad, dark and blurry, there were times that you could not even tell what your character was doing on screen. Add in a broken camera and the game is simply crap.Thank goodness for Syphon Filter on the PSP! UbiSoft needs to stick to consoles."
5,Sensa Trac Strut 95 Grand AM,Works great. Fast delivery. Will probably buy ready-to-install strut in future because strut mount bearing was bad so for $40 more could have saved myself a lot of labor.
5,Faster are better?!,"Of course ""faster are better"" apparently is a wrong idea musically. However, for Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No.3, this idea is not completely inappropriate because this piece should be performed at a really fast speed but the later generation of pianists tend to slow down this piece because of the difficulties on ""physical technique"". Here I am not saying that slow is wrong. What I am saying here is that, the Rach3 should be performed fast, not slow. The Rachmaninoff himself performed this piece use only 35 minutes, same after Vladimir Horowitz. If you here Horowitz's 1941 version and Rachmaninoff's 1932 version. You will know the truth about this piece!!...Believe me!"
2,Not the greatest sound quality,"The recording does not compare to today's sound quality. From now on, I only buy reordingsmade since 1990 onward."
3,brilliant playing; dull sound,"I can't add anything to the praise that's already been heaped on the playing of Kissin, but the sound quality on this disc is really dull. It sounds as if the recording engineers covered the mike with a pillow. I have to turn my stereo up almost as loud is it will go to hear the notes, and even then the sound has a heavy muffled quality. I certainly hope that the same artists will re-record this in a good studio someday."
2,Kissin is yet to show intensity for Russian composer's work,"Contrary to most of reviews so far, I can only give 2 stars to this recording. That's after I heard Argerich's Rach 3rd live, recorded in Berlin in 1982.Kissin is on of the living great. No doubt about it. I love his Chopin and Beethoven. But somehow, when it comes to Russian composers, he didn't seem to be able convey the intensity. I have heard both his Rach 2nd and 3rd. And it sounds like he was being too meticulous with the techniques in both cases. And as the result, the work slowed down and lost the intensity and spontaneity.For Rach 2nd, I'd recommend Julius Katchin/Solti, It's very old, and 3rd, Argerich/Chailly live."
2,Wish I could say more...,"The liner notes speak to Kissin's preference for making live recordings. In much of his repertoire, he has achieved great success in this approach. Unfortunately, this release is hampered by a milquetoast orchestral accompaniment and truly awful recording balancing. The result is a muffled, somewhat flat performance that cannot be redeemed by Kissin's playing, which is at times revelatory. In modern sound, Martha Argerich's is still the one to beat. Older recordings that hold up quite well include Ashkenazy's 60's go round, Van Cliburn's, and, for reference, the composer's own recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Ormandy."
2,"Good performance, but where's the excitement?!?","I disagree with most of the other people who have commented on this recording. I own 4 recordings of this war-horse, and I consider this to be the worst. Sure, he plays it flawlessly and it IS technically perfect...but it lacks the emotion and excitment that can be found in recordings by Ashkenazy(1963), Argerich, and Leif Ove Andsnes(sp). In fact, I enjoy the encores more than the performance of the Rach3 on this cd. Kissin is a great pianist, but I am more convinced by his performances of Prokofiev and Chopin than I am of his Rachmaninoff. If you're looking for a good performance of this concerto, check out the Reissued/remastered performance by Ashkenazy from 1963(on the London/Decca label). It also contains a very passionate, moving performance of the Rachmaninoff 2nd concerto on it. But I think the ultimate Rach3 is definately Martha Argerich's. But if you prefer a dry, unmoving performance, this Kissin recording may be the one for you."
5,Very Good Quality !,"Am happy with this purchase, My wife tried these on and the size and width were perfect, its amazing the amount of work that go""s into these boots, the company uses quality material and workmanship and yet charges awesome prices that makes it easy for anyone to own a pair of boots from propet, am very happy with this purchase and Happy Wife means Happy Life lol !"
4,winter shoe,"I purchased this shoe late in our Alaska winter season (March). It is true to size. I always order a size larger so I can wear heavy wool socks when I'm out and about. I like the ease of fastening the shoe using the velcro but what I'm not particularly fond of is the amount of fluff around the top of the shoe - it keeps my feet warm but my pants don't fit over the top of the shoe (I wear straight leg jeans). If you wear boot cut jeans or wider bottom pants, these shoes should be perfect for you. I would recommend these waterproof leather shoes because they are comfortable and very warm."
1,No good!,don't order if you have wide feet and if you have normal you'll have to order wider than you usually do.
3,Propet Women's WB005 Frost Walker Weather Shoe,I have had this same boot before. The previous pair wore down at the heel more than I would have expected. Too soon to say about the new pair. It is a bit stiff around the ankle due in part to the strap fastener. The padding makes it easier to tolerate that factor. It is about the only boot on the market that is very easy to get your feet into - especially if you have issues with swelling of foot and/or ankle which makes it almost impossible to put on most boots.
3,Fuzz at collar too much,"I liked the boot overall, it was adjustable, it was fairly cushy on the bottom, but the fuzz at the top stuck out about an inch in the back, so my pants got caught on it. Unless I continuously adjusted my pants leg, they sat bunched up on top of the fuzz. There was so much fuzz on the inside, a warm pair of socks was impossible, only the thinest socks would fit, and I have very thin feet, so they weren't warm enough for the outside walking I do. Maybe they would work for someone who wore leggings or slim pants, and didn't need them for warmth."
5,Works Great!,"Anyone that knows that this is the way to go with Motorolla phones with the expandable memory drive. You'll definitely want to get this. I own a ROKR Motorolla and the 512 holds alot of songs. I can carry about 200-210 songs. Or if you do music videos about 50. I have heard the next upgrades will be 1GB by Fall 2006. So yea I cant wait that long.I also use this for my Canon Camera. Canon is a SD but by using the transflash adapter with the transflash memory in it, it works just like a normal SD.Hope that helps."
3,Almost a good watch,"The dial is great, looks cool and sleek. The only main problem I had with this was the strap. More information on the type of strap has to be provided on the site. The strap I got was a Velcro one! I expected it to be a normal plastic strap with a buckle. Velcro ones are extremely difficult to handle when you wear or remove the watch. Multiple angles of the watch have to be provided so that the customer can make a complete review before deciding to buy it."
5,Great book!,"My husband and I are working through this book together and it really has been interesting how ""dead on"" their insight seems to be on how and why men and women are like we are. It is easier to deal with your spouse if you can understand why they react to you the way they do. My only concern with this book is that the 2 authors appear to be ""unmarried"" from their descriptions on the cover and their dedications. It would be nice to see that they have learned how to create a happy relationship in their own lives for lots of years... then their credibility would go up drastically in my mind."
4,Enlightening book,"This book showed me how all the things I was told to do in other self-help books was errored- and how they didn't work. It shows why the most dreaded sentence to a husband is ""We need to talk"".Girl-don't treat your husband like a girlfriend- it's not going to work!It's a must-read!"
4,Very useful-A guide to the thought processes of the opposite sex.,"The authors have some short essays on the web. Check them out, they very accurately represent the book. A guide to the thought processes of the opposite sex. Very useful."
5,How to improve your marriage without talking about it,Fantastic! Finally answered the real reasons behind so many marriage problems. Would recommend it as COMPULSORY reading for every male and female on the planet old enough to be in a serious relationship. Brings new hope to all couples adrift and not able to understand what's been going on.Should be taught in schools. Thanks Drs Pat Love & Steven Stosny.
3,good read,"still reading, pretty intense, learning more from every page. Didnt think I could still learn about marriage after 33 years, like they say, you learn something new everyday and I certainly am reading this book"
2,How to improve your marriage without reading about it.,I've been trying desperately to get through this book. It has some good points but the writing is so bad that it is painful and hard work to read. I can only handle a few pages a night. And I'm usually one to devour a book. Not worth it my opinion. The few points - shame vs fear is pretty much covered in the first chapter. After that? Downhill. Sorry!
2,Not too bad,"There are plenty of worse psychology books around (Lord knows), and this one does offer some genuine insights - in particular, the fact that if a relationship is troubled, just talking about it can only make it worse. However, the book also offers its share of stupid ideas and bad advice. For example: ""When a woman shames a man, she's wrong even if she's right. When a man stimulates a woman's fear, he's wrong even if he's right."" (There's more where that came from.) The book is a mix of valid information and sheer nonsense-which is average for its type. It can be useful if your relationship needs work, but there are a lot more interesting things to waste your money on."
4,Good info but VERY wordy,"I fell asleep while reading this. It does contain useful information and advice but I would recommend just skipping over all the "" mark and Marlene"" stories."
4,Great book,This books shows you a complete differnt way of looking at your marriage and yourself. I recomend it to anyone that is having marrage problems
2,way too simplistic,"I just can't swallow that everything I do is driven by fear and everything he does is driven by shame - or the avoidance of...I do appreciate some of the insight, but don't believe that humans are that single-minded and driven by only one emotion."
5,Should be in every Western student's library,"Edited by two African-American scholars, this encyclopedia is a fascinating wealth of information about human history that takes a decidedly non-Eurocentric point of view. Of course, there is European information like the great writers and opera composers, but there is also entries for African, Chinese, Latin American and Asian people, events, cultural movements and politics.For instance, pages 164 - 165 contains entries on Dada (International visual arts and literary movement); Dahomey, kingdom of (African kingdom); Dakshina (Region of India); Dali Lama XIV (Spiritual leader of the Tibetians); Dalton, Roque (El Salvadoran poet, historian and revolutionary); Damien, Father (Belgian priest and missionary).I keep my copy in my bathroom, and have been reading through it for a few years.I have ordered copies for a number of young people, so they can grow up less ignorant about the world and history."
4,Steam: Indias last steam trains,I thought this was a wonderful book about indias last steam trains. It was very helpful for school reports to. I would suggest this book to any won curious and excited about learning about India's famous railways. This book is worth purchasing.
4,Jaunty if familiar action sci fi,"This book posits a future history in which human civilization is controlled by declining societies, while ""outlaw"" groups provide an alternative approach which is, by turns, both chilling and promising. Folks are wired, cyberspace reaches its logical limits, and conspiracies abound. The central love story is odd and yet workable, but it's the action that dominates in this story of a fellow who escapes from space buccaneers only to find dark doings back on his home world. This is a modern sci fi,with frequent nods to earlier era work, but all in a post-this, post-that world. This is one of a series of ""rigger"" books (a ""rigger"" steers a ship in surreal hyperspace travel in a ""flux""), satisfying hard science, interesting soft plot. Nothing all that new here, but not a bad flight."
4,Fun Read for Sci-Fi Fans,"This book is a great adventure; the ideas of the flux, underflux and the adventures the characters have in it are compelling and interesting. I enjoyed this book and will look for others by Carver in the Rigger universe and elsewhere."
3,An light and entertaining story,"This book is easy too read and well entertaining. The characters aren't very deep and there are no major surprises in the story. But what really sucks after a while is the Christian references that come up all the time. It is hard to imagine for me that in a distant future people (and even aliens) still hang after that pityful religion. After a while, you get the feeling that Carver propably supports ""Intelligent Design"" and other stupidities too.But if you can ignore that, its still an entertaining book worth to read if you don't have anything better at hand."
3,It's a fuse,This is a fuse to protect electronic equipment from excessive current draw. It works just fine. Make sure it is the right physical size and current rating for your application.
3,China Bayles - amateur slueth,"As much as I enjoy this series, I feel like something is lacking, I just can't figure out what it is. I like the closeness of the characters, but have a hard time looking at them realistically. China is off on another investigation, this time trying to free her friend and animal rights activist, Dr. Riddle, from a murder charge. China owns an herb shop, but can always seem to find someone to 'mind the store' anytime of day whenever she needs to go nosing around on a case. This is the third in the series, and I'm not seeing any character development at all. The storylines are fun and good for a quick read, and I'm hoping the author will bring China out of her shell a little bit in future books and make her more enthusiastic toward her relationship with McQuaid."
4,A solid third helping..,"Susan Wittig Albert's third mystery of the China Bayles series, ""Hangman's Root"", is a solid mystery, with a surprising killer, and a murder victim with a history of doing horrible, sadistic things to people and animals. China's friend, Dottie Riddle, a biology professor and a ""cat lady"" is the prime suspect in the murder of the sadistic Dr. Harwick, a colleague. Soon China finds that extortion, embezzlement, and deep hatred figure into this killing. Meanwhile, China and Mike are trying to find a house that they could both move into, with some comic results, and Rudy is trying to deal with a reunion with the daughter she gave up years ago. Not quite as good as ""Witches Bane"", but the sotry introduces us to some intriguing new characters."
5,a great interpretation,"In my opinion, Zukerman/Neikrug's rendition captures the essence of the Spring and Kreutzer sonatas better than the few other recordings I've heard.Its flowing, dynamic, and tightly integrated feel gives this recording the character that the others lack."
2,I gave this CD away,"Zuckerman and Neikrug combine for a deadening, bored performance of two wonderful pieces by Beethoven. Lifeless is another word that springs to mind. This is probably the worst of any Beethoven Violin Sonata performance I've heard. As an alternative, I'll suggest the superb disc covering the same works done by Anne-Sophie Mutter and Lambert Orkis on DG, which is highly expressive, risk-taking and downright exciting. I gave this Zukerman bore away so it wouldn't clutter up my shelves."
5,Great Book,I loved this book and believed that God did bring this book to me. Very helpful and inspiring to read. Definitely recommend.
2,It's all about NETWORKING,"This book is a major disappointment. Throughout the book the writer's suggestions are basically to tell enough people about what your needs are so that someone can help you. There are a few examples of supernatural intervention, however, the main idea is to help God help you. I needed more that than simplistic approach to everything this book has to offer.I am surprised that Henry Cloud is successful as a counselor. Even his comments concerning marriage is confusing and weak."
2,It's brown,"I was so excited to get this because I'm doing a sports theme room for my boys. I order 2 of these along with the soccer ball, football, and glove and baseball. I was very disappointed to find out that the basketball were brown and not at all like the picture. I wanted the orange to brighten up their dresser but now the only thing that is bright is the soccer ball and the lil baseball. It is cute to say the least, but I would've still liked it to look like the picture. Just got them yesterday and still deciding whether I should keep them or not because I'm keeping the rest of the knobs...just wished it looked like the picture, oh well!!!"
4,Nice flashlight,This was a gift for someone who has to go out at night to walk the dog. They liked the gift and the brightness of the light.
5,Lite up your Life,"It goes with out saying this is by far the best Flashlight to own, it stands up to everyday life , MAGLITE is a name you can depend on, you will not fine better even if you go with Surefird Flashightsfor the money MAG is an Outstanding Deal! ""more then 5 Stars"""
3,This is not LED,"I have to give the item 3 stars because it is in fact a new MagLite, the color is correct, and the description is accurate. I ordered this because the product specifications said the bulb was LED. I will be returning this flashlight, and will edit my post after the return is complete."
4,Good light,Good solid flashlight. Nice & bright with good beam adjustment. Only complaint is no lanyard or clip to hang it.
5,Light Up,Just love these flashlights and the way you can make the area of illumination smaller or larger. Also that they are so wonderfully made. Would recommend them to anyone.
1,Your not actually thinking of buying this are you?,I must warn you about this book. If you are planning to pay this much for a book on analytical views you have too much money! You can spend 5 bucks on the actual book and READ IT. One hundred times if necessary. At least you wont be wasting your time and suddenly looking forward to watching C-span2. Seriously if you have this much money email me I can put it to much better use. As for my rating of 1 they wont let me use negatives.
3,Bit of a let down,"Wasn't very funny (a few chuckles here & there, very few) & not quite horror either. I really wanted to like this movie. Good cast & acting, story was kind of weak & SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER... how could you not see the priest wasn't who he seemed (maybe you were supposed to know? ending just felt like it ran out of steam)."
3,Dead movie,"Where do I begin? Ok, I wasn't thrilled with this one. I bought it from reviews I read, but I was disappointed with the whole thing. It gets slow too often and there's not much real ""horror"" to it. It's almost a spoof on the zombie/vampire idea of the dead. I felt it was too long drawn out with no real reason to be. The potential for a substantial movie was definitely there, but they dropped the ball on making it happen. If you are a horror fan, do not buy this. You will be disappointed. If you like a light horror and spoof kind of thing, this is made for you. I loved one scene, only because it was funny and just so off the wall you had to laugh. The ending was what I expected, so I wasn't even surprised there. It was ok.This is a spoiler so don't read further:My favorite scene: they were on the beach and a zombie was in the ""cage"" and when Valentine took her mask off.........."
4,Payback's a Hoot,"Two down and out grave robbers stumble onto the high paying yet risky business of selling unread. A great movie for anyone looking to be entertained. Yes some things are predictable. However, watch with an open mind not expecting an Oscar winner. You'll like it."
4,Not what you would expect.,"This is one of those movies that may be better served with a better title. You see the ""I sell the dead"" and the cover and think....""This is probably some low budget, poor quality movie"" and as I am sure the budget was small the quality is not! This is a very unique film, sort of a shout out to a lot of different types of ""horror"" films but still very original. The acting as great, sets are moody and well conceived considering the budget. I would recommend this to any fan of horror movies."
4,Loved it,"I sell the dead was great. Funny, well acted, entertaining, spooky, original, etc.It's uneven at times, and shows it's budget on occasion, but it's one hell of a fun movie overall.Take a look!"
4,i sell the dead,its a good four star its different in some way as the story line is not easily figured out . i like it shows old scenes of life way back hundred of years or so ago. i would not like to live then but it was a good story worht being in my collection of five thousand movies
2,The Dead are NOT rolling over,"The Dead are not rolling over, not with laughter anyway. Dull, boring, disappointing are not the adjectives that should be linked to a comedy but there you are. I honestly can't give you any details on the quality of the movie's ending, because 2/3's in I decided life is to short & turned it off."
2,Comedy/Horror,"Hello, Well; This was OK, It was a lot of talking which some of the movie was, shall I say; Stupid!It started to get boring really quickly. I guess that's what it was suppose to be! Other than that,It was just ok."
2,"This movie is right up my alley, but...","Great cast, great idea and stylish.... but it was missing something. It was neat to look at, but I never really connected to it.There were a whole lot of good ideas, but not enough was done with them. The movie would have been better if it were longer to expand on the ideas or more focused. Most of Arthur's apprenticeship could have been cut for instance.The horror wasn't particularly scary and the humor snicker worthy at best. Combined with the slow pacing, it's just too many strikes against the movie. It's a shame, because this movie has the cast and ingredients to be a genuine cult classic."
5,"clever,outside the box!",This is one of the 3 best zombie flicks i have seen this year! The other 2 being Zombieland and Dead snow.
2,Could just be me...,"My fiance insisted I watch this movie. I love zombies and she had me convinced that this would be fantastic. I wasn't sure, but I went into it with high hopes, especially once I saw Ron Perlman was in it. I definitely didn't get what I was expecting. The low budget didn't kill it, in fact it sort of made it cool in a way (the backdrops and sets are quite interesting), the acting is what did it in. That and the story. The undead seemed absurd beyond what I'm willing to tolerate and the actors made it very aware that they were acting. As far as the story goes, there really wasn't one. At least not until the last 15 minutes or so, then it gets watchable...and then the credits.My fiance loved this movie, adored it. I hate it. Could just be me, but surely I'm not the only one."
1,Poor Service,Very poor service... vendor did not mail book and I was forced to buy the book at a bookstore in order to have it for class.Vendor blamed it on being new to the process... unfortunately I suffered the loss...I asked for a refund...
4,Fantastic Travelogue But Missing The Famous Engravings,"John Stephens' travels into Central America and the Yucatan are the grist from which the Indiana Jones movies were ground. His Incidents of Travel in Central America Vol 1 & 2 as well as Incidents of Travel in Yucatan Vol 1& 2 are amazing...a lost civilization buried under the vegetation of the central American rain forest, completely unknown but only rumored to exist because of the tales of the shadowy jungle chiclet hunters. This amazing travelogue holds up well for it's age and is an easy read even by today's standards. The sad part is that the amazing Mayan engravings of Catherwood are not in the free or .99 Kindle versions. There is a Kindle version of the Travels in Yucatan Vol 1&2 that has Catherwood's engravings..for $6.99. That is the version you probably should get."
3,"Good novela, bad video","I really liked this novela when it was on tv, but I think video was a bad rendition of it. I understand the original was too long and needed to be cut, but I don't think the editing was done well. So much was taken out that the story line ends up being confusing if one has not seen the original. It is also hard to really get attached to the characters or the storyline this way, so it's almost pointless to watch it at all. I guess it is ok for someone who has seen the original and just wants to own a copy of the video to be reminded of the novela, but for a first-time viwer this is a waste of time! I was also disappointed they didn't include the original soundtrack with Ricardo Arjona ""Desnuda"". It was a much better song than the obscure piece that was included in the video. I wonder why they changed that (maybe Arjona didn't give them permission?)."
3,Wrong Item,Was not powerful enough to run my monitor without overheating. I used it on another lower power consumption device and it work fine. I would not order this for another monitor.
4,Copying file is easy.....,"So far, so good. Here is a tip for people having trouble copying files: Dont use musicmatch, just use windows explorer! In xp and 2000(maybe 98 too...not sure) it should show up as a removeable drive."
1,Thought it was great until...,"it would no longer turn on. The customer service is atrocious at best, bordering on non-existent. When my player would no longer turn on, I followed the instructions and sent it back to the service center with a note describing the problem. Well, they have had the unit since Jan. 18 and still no sign of it. After being given misleading information over several calls, I was finally told that I would have to wait until Mar 14 before they will negotiate a 'buy back' price with me. Adding insult to injury, they make the customer responsible for keeping track of the progress of the repair (no callbacks or e-mail notifications available). I hope you all can benefit from my painful experience. Do not buy anything from RCA/Lyra; it is not worth the risk."
2,what's this?,"Have not put the seat on the bicycle because there are no instructions. There is no information about which company made the seat. It just says ""made in taiwan"" For all I know this is a bicycle seat off of someone's old bicycle. Just a seat in a plastic bag. For this price?"
4,2003 and still a fav!,"Ralph Covert and Co. never fail to satisfy with great pop/rock sensiblities, even on this early album. Smart, witty lyrics and great writing and musicianship (even more apparent on the live album ""Cheap Beer Night"", featuring the late guitar great John Duich) from the extremely well crafted rhythm section of Terry and Pickles, and the excellent guitar work of Tommy O'Brian. These guys have sold a ton of albums and toured extensively, but it seems it's mostly the overseas crowd that has given them the appreciation they have always deserved.I keep close tabs on Ralph and his continuing progressive work, but this CD is always a great reminder of what pros at any level should aspire to."

2,"Botox, bite me","Olivia, good god. Oh, her voice is still that soprano breathy siren that we all fell in love with in the 70's, but why the botox? We love you just the way you are. It's okay, hon."
2,She has few concerts available on dvd to compare this with.,I just watched this & was a bit let down. First the tour of Australia in between songs should have been a seperate extra not padding for the dvd. I corrected Amazons running time or tried to this runs 127 minutes not 187 as first listed. She ran through some of her hits with just a few lines from the songs & ran through full length lesser known songs. Physical was turned into a slow lounge song for elevator music. The early Olivia in concert from the early 1980s was far superior. I thought Carly Simon on the Queen Mary did her songs with more life than Olivia did hers. Her one back up singer looks like a young clone of Laura Branigan. Thats the way i saw the concert for my review.
4,always impressive,This lady will always impress me and this is a nice cd. of her and the orchestra. Her voice is still magic.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this DVD for my wife who has many of Olivia's CD's which she plays a lot. When my wife saw this DVD she said 'who is that old lady?' Why did Olivia wear a golden version of one of her grandad's old suits? Is she too old to look femminine? Why sit down to sing several upbeat country songs? Is Olivia too old to stand up? This version of 'Your the one that I want' is pathetic. All the numbers have been slowed to walking (sleeping) pace and 'Let's Get Physical' is anything but. Totally lifeless numbers, the fire has gone out.Continue making CD's Olivia, but give up the stage if this is the best that you can do. The 1982 live concert video is far far superior. We have now trashed the Live at the Sydney Opera House DVD."
2,Shortened versions of too many hits. Why the rush Olivia?,"If you're going to perform a song, perform the ENTIRE SONG. Don't leave out verses. Unfortunately, there's too much of this, especially during the country segment of the concert. Very disappointing."
3,It's Okay,I bought this to use on my riding lawn mower. It works OK but the quality is not the greatest. I'll probably have to replace it by the end of this mowing season.
2,Save your money,"this product was very difficult to attach since you couldnt see where the screw was going when you inserted it. The metal clamps on the back are very flimsy, tough to line up with proper hole, wouldn't snug up tight even with several spacers i had to insert. there must be better ones out there."
5,Less Stress on injuries,This item is great for anyone that may have shoulder damage or severe arthritic problems. I bought my self one and I bought one for a friend with severe RA
4,Nice product,"This worked well. If you plan on replacing the image with one of your own, this knob isnt really made to come appart easy. Other such knobs of this style screw appart this style however snaps together and is risky business getting apart. Although it can be done, it can be avoided. But the product itself, over all, looks better then its alternate versions mentioned above it."
1,difficult to install,very difficult to install and would not recommend this. People who need this product usually have use of only one hand. This product cannot be installed with one hand.
4,Spinner,"Was not the one I ordered, but I only wanted the mounting straps.I have a old Elvis spinner which would not fit newer cars. Newstraps were a little hard to put on (should make them a little longer)but they work after a half hour work."
3,It's ok,"The good news is you can remove the clear plastic top and insert whatever graphic you want -- the strange news is that the mounting mechanism doesn't assume a SMALL, round steering wheel -- but it works"
5,Steering Wheel Spinner,This as a gift for my truck driving sister in law. It was all I hoped for in quality and price. Would purchase it again should the need arise.
2,Not as helpful as other books on this subject.,"Although the information given about identifying and diagnosing Asperger's Syndrome was excellent, I feel that other references, such as that written by Tony Attwood, were much more helpful with the nuts and bolts of teaching techniques. In my opinion, the limited usefulness of the book certainly did not justify the price."
2,"Instruction is good, what little there is!","This is obviously a transfer from VHS. There are no menu's or chapters to get directly to the area you are interested in. The instruction they do have on there is good. They explain some of the basics well, and the 2 instructors are obviously very good at them. The only problem is that there just isn't much on there. I read the product info over on another website, and it mentions that they include Bunkai (applications) for the movements in the Kata's...They do not. They also teach a couple of odd ""pre"" Kata's that I have not seen in any other Wado-Ryu school or DVD. They look more like the beginning short forms from American Kenpo. I think they copied them. Anyway, this DVD is just ok."
4,I loved it,"I gave The Journey Of Hannah four stars because no story can be perfect. The Journey of Hannah is about a girl who is sold to a very kind Master and Mistress called the Duvanes to help care for their expected baby, but when the baby and Mother die Hannah is no use to her Master anymore. Then she is sold to the Weston family who is very cruel to her and slap her often. They also force her to steal from coustemers who are staying at the tavern they own. Hannah would have not been able to make it had it not been for kind,sweet Miss. Rachel who lives nextdoor to the Weston family. When Hannah runs away she finds her previous owner Alex Duvane who leads her to Christ and helps her to find a true,loving home."
1,disappointing analysis of furniture and architecture,"chinese furniture have a strong relationship with architecture, in its proportion, construction, and relationship to the space. I was looking forward to see a more detailed analysis of such relationship but this book turned out to be a mediocre repetition of numerous chinese furniture books already in the market. Many of the pictures are from dealer's photos or Museum's existing photos. The reference paintings are primary from Chin P'ing Mei or similar paintings which have been published numerous times by other authors. The sketch or drawings are mediocre. There are no measured or proportional anaylsis of the furniture to the architecture. I have returned this book."
1,not the original artists,"As close as I can tell, these are not the original artists. Check Billy Joe Royal on ""Down in the Boondocks"" and then listen to another version. Similar but I don't think it's the original artist. If I am wrong, I apologize. But, I grew up on these songs."
2,Eh,Didn't work as well as I'd hope. Bristles are hard and can be painful at times. I didn't notice a difference.
5,LOVE!,I love the skin brush. It has dramatically increased the circulation in my skin! Great product! Definitely would recommend this brush!
4,I liked,"its a pleasant massager and you can use wiyh your cellulite cream. I dont know if it is very durable, but worth."
3,Eh,"I actually already had a cellulite massager by Bliss that I purchased from Sephora. I prefer that one to this one. The strap doesnt fit securely across my hand, and it makes it hard to hold esp in the shower, or at for that matter. I am going to do some more research, perhaps this one needs to be used differently."
5,Good for face and eye massage,"I guessed it might works for massaging on face and nerves surrounds eyes, and bought it.It seems to be able to serve this purpose right, especially after working in front of computers for a long time."
4,Finally!,"At last Gilbert has written an intelligent, disciplined work instead of the usual self-indulgent, semiautobiographical, mildly pornographic chatter of his previous novels."
5,Rammstein take on Depeche Mode,"Well, ""Stripped"" is a cover by one of my favorite bands, Rammstein, of another of my favorites, Depeche Mode. The original is sooo beautiful, and Rammstein's version holds up very, very well! I highly recommend both bands, and I must say I gained a lot of respect for Rammstein when I learned they were Depeche Mode fans. Ahh, I love it!"
5,hard to find cover song,I have spent a decent amount of time trying to find this cover through the various music services and at just about every specialty record store that I walk into. Excellent cover of an old Depeche Mode song.
4,A good foundation,"Yes, these recipes can be a little bland, and they aren't really low-calorie, but for novice bakers who want to cut refined sugar out of their diets, this book provides basic recipes that are easy to liven up. I for one need to know how much flour, baking soda, oil, etc. to use.The author herself offers many suggestions for toppings and mix-ins to help sweeten or spice up these recipes. The fruit breads, for example. are really good with some no-sugar-added jams swirled into the batter. And I double or triple the spices called for. Finally, it's important to remember that this book came out decades before natural sugar substitutes like Stevia (although it's not a good idea to go overboard on that because of the licorice undertaste, but 4 packets for the fruit breads is about right to me).Don't expect to duplicate the taste of your favorite sugary snacks. Fruit juice-sweetened recipes are different - but I for one have come to prefer them."
2,This is not the dessert you are looking for...,"If you read the intro, you'll find that this chef and her family had not consumed processed sugar for years before she started making these ""desserts."" Perhaps that had made her family more attuned to the sweetness of these recipes. I tried 6 of the recipes, and really wanted them to be delicious, but none of them were. I did not try the pies, which are easy to make sugar free; instead I tried some of the more exotic ones, like ""pineapple blueberry bars"" and ""banana coconut bread."" All of them simply lacked sweetness, while having a mild fruit flavor - I would rather simply consume fresh fruit than make these.I was able to salvage each dessert by putting a sugar glaze on the top (1/3 c sugar and a few tablespoons lemon juice or milk). They tasted more like a dessert then, and I still didn't feel too guilty about eating them, since they did not have as much sugar as a ""normal"" dessert."
1,Sweet and Sugarfree,"I have so far tried the peanut butter cookies and the lemon moon cookies... and they were unedible. I'm hoping some of the cakes and pies are better, but the two cookies I tried so far are terrible! No one in our household will eat them."
3,Okay,"I wanted a book that would help me give up sugar and sweeteners. While this book meets that criteria, the recipes are hit and miss."
4,hideous sun demon,i remember this movie as a kid on creature features and found it a nightmare.i am interested in buying it now but at 17.99 i feel it is way over priced.come down to half the price and i would buy it today.
2,cross between film noir and horror that just doesn't work,"...The sympathetic feelings we are urged to feel for the ""victim"" are mitigated by his obvious misguided set of priorities. Save your money and get either a real good film noir or a really good horror movie (or one of each).About as satifying as a flat glass of softdrink......"
1,Anyone smell cheese??,"This one is kind of a werewolf in reverse. Due to a dose of radiation, a scientist turns into a lizard man when exposed to sunlight. I kept waiting for something to happen. The monster looked ok for a rubber suit type creature but the movie moved pretty slowly to a predictable ending. A couple of cuties were the decoration and love interests (yes two of 'em)in this hollywood effort. The picture quality went from ok to terrible,then back to ok, as did the sound."
1,Saturday Morning Movies,I saw this movie back in the 60's on TV Saturday morning and thought it was unusual. Unfortunately the movie doesn't hold up very well anymore. This is for film buffs who enjoy this type of movie.
3,low budget sci fier is still fun today.,I always loved these cheesy horror/sci fi flicks from the fifties. This one is one of those and remains alot of fun to watch today. As the sun turns a scientist into a scaly monster. THe monster looks pretty cool actually and would make a good comic book villian. The hulk could fight him! But seriously a sci fi fan who doesn't love old stuff may not find this to their liking as it's a cheap flick from the fifties. I still enjoy it's low budget charm and decent acting. the picture quality is ok here and I think the version with elvira as the host looks a little better. But she pops into the movie and that's not cool. ALthough; I do enjoy her premovie narration. This is for vintage low budget sci fi fans for sure. If you aren't a fan of that stuff and bug movies etc from the past then this isn't for you. BUt I am! So it's all good to me.
2,What was I thinking?,Oh well you can't win them all. Started out kind of corny and just kind of lost me. Hope movie budge was not too high.
4,You get what you pay for.,The cheaper price compared to the Edelbrock Performer made this intake attractive. I read several performance magazine reviews and it made good power for an entry level manifold. The only cons I have found so far is the quality of the machining and poor port alignment compared to a stock ford 1993 cobra intake gaskets. The worst of it is the passenger side water passage is poorly cut and actually larger than the gasket. One must take into consideration that this intake is $40 cheaper than the competition. Oh and it has a cool little Spartan style helmet stamped into the front runner.
5,Another amazing collection by the Directors Label,"This boxed set is 100% the best hands down. It contains the most classic and perfectly executed works from Mark Romanek, Jonathan Glazer, Anton Corbijn and Stephane Sednaoui. They each come with a flawlessly printed booklet detailing interviews and conceptual information pertaining to each video by the artists. The quality of the videos is superb and I can only hope that they will soon be available on Blu-ray format. I highly suggest this boxed set to anyone looking for inspiration or simply for a great watch."
3,Not nearly as good as the first set,"I have not watched every single video in the package (because I got bored of them). But I feel qualified to make a short review.The first set was so good you could actually invite friends over and enjoy some Michel Gondry and Chris Cunningham together. Not so with this set. The videos are not crowd pleasers, and the videos here are generally more pretentious, especially those from Anton Corbijn (photographer turned video director). In the interviews you will see artists freely admitting they have no idea what such and such video is about. If you don't like symbolism, you are in for a ""Bumpy Ride.""It seems like I am watching some of these videos for a college class in music video history, like ""this was the first video to ever use soft focus"", or, ""this was the first music video that uses Slow Motion."" So like another guy already said, they pale compared to what is on MTV right this minute."
5,Newborn is a rocking album,"Newborn is one of the James Gang's best albums but it never got the praise it deserved. It features Bubba Keith as a superb lead vocalist and songwriter of most of the tunes on this album. Check out their cover of Heartbreak Hotel. That's the way it's done Elvis!! If you love 70's rock with lots of crunchy, rocking guitars and great vocals this album is for you! You don't have to be a James Gang fan to get into this one. GPark"
2,Not the best book for beginners,"The book is full of bright ideas. However, I would not recommend it for the people who just start doing origami. The author sometimes skips a step so it is very confusing. I left some projects unfinished."
2,Received the wrong book,"The book that Amazon sent me is not the book that John Walton Caughey wrote; the title is similar to the book that Caughey wrote, but the book I received was written by Frank de Varona, and is intended for middle grade school children."
2,too garbled,"I have an extensive collection of books on native plants - and the plantsto go with them! This book is one of my least favorite. The information isnot well sorted or presented. I would recommend C. Colston Burrell's""Encyclopedia of Wildflowers"" in preference to this book.Or Carole Otteson's ""Native Plant Primer"" with trees and shrubs in addition toherbaceous perennials."
3,"Good content, don't like how it's presented","This is one of the better books when it comes to information about growing native plants. The authors are not shy about their opinions and the book is better for it.On the down side, the book is not nearly as exhaustive as Cullina's books. I also don't like that it puts the photographs apart from the text, as this makes for some annoying page-flipping. The quality of the photographs is also rather amateurish.A tepid recommendation would be a hearty one with a better layout and improved pictures."
3,Not Really Gilgamesh,"I bought this Gilgamesh along with the new rendition by Stephen Mitchell. Of the two, I would highly recommend that the potential reader buy the Mitchell version.My problem with this lusty, powerfully written and masculine poem, is that it is not Gilgamesh. The poet has been so free in rendering Gilgamesh into modern English that the epic story is almost completely lost. I would rate it higher if it had a different title with something like ""A New Poem Loosely Based on the Ancient Epic""... something like that. And very loosely at that! Kind of like ""Truth-in-Lending"".The reader who is new to Gilgamesh will be totally baffled by this ancient classic if the Hines version is the one he or she buys. I think that the reader who is well acquainted with this nearly 5,000-year-old epic might very well find new delights in Derrek Hines's poem. But again, it just isn't Gilgamesh and should be sold as something else."
3,Poetry is great but Kindle formatting is horrible,"I buy only eBooks these days, and while I expect to put up with some formatting weirdness in free/extra-cheap public domain books, that really isn't very tolerable in contemporary books that cost real money (even if it isn't a ton of money). And therein lies my problem with this book. I *loved* this new, sassy rendering of the story, but it was hard to get the full impact when in every hyphenated word (of which there were a lot--with good poetic effect) the hyphen was rendered as an m-dash, giving a wholly different effect than intended. On top of the unpleasant halting, stuttering effect achieved by that formatting abnormality, there were a few other weirdnesses, such as ""tl"" being routinely rendered as ""d"" leading to some unusual misspellings that weren't always easy to work out until one figured out the pattern of error. Publishers, please, do bother to proofread your electronic versions. This was just sloppy, and I returned my copy because of it."
3,Sunshade works!,"I finally found a sunshade that fits my Maxima's windshield properly!The claim that it lowers temperatures by 40 degrees is a bit of an overestimate, but it definitely is cooler after a long day sitting in the South Texas sun!The only problem I have is that it's bulky and clumsy to roll up and store.That is why I only use it for long days at work. For shorter errand hops, it isn't conducive. The sunshade arrived quickly and was oackaged in a sturdy box. There were no return instructions if it needed to be sent back."
5,Best conditioner ever!,"Once you use this conditioner, you won't ever go back. It leaves your hair super soft and silky. Not oily at all. Fantastic product. Highly recommend it!"
2,not the same as it used to be,"yes, it straightens your hair more more it smells like a bad chemical. I read about the ingredients and learned that they are not the best to use. I was desperate and you used it anyway but this isn't the same product it used to be years ago. It felt like I was using a relaxer. I would probably find a different product."
4,"nice watch, unfortunate watchband","I like the watch even though the case is obviously plastic except for the backing plate. The bigger issue is the band. I like the colors of the band as depicted in the picture, (khaki strap with brown leather accents). But because it is an adjustable velcro fastener, there is a strip of black velcro sewn over the entire length of the weaved khaki strap on one side so half of the watchband (the half that I always see when I wear it) is a piece of black velcro loops. You can just barely see it at the bottom of the picture. I do like the very readable face and the backlit feature is handy in the dark. OK overall but I'll be looking for a better band."
3,nice watch.. nothin special,"I really don't like such plain watches, although this is a really nice product. Its a great camping watch and looks real nice in my opinion. Its also strong and stays clean looking with a wipe of the side of a shirt"
3,A plastic toy,"Honestly, when seeing this watch in the images I thought it would be a real sport watch. The one to inspire trust and resistance. Unfortunately it looks like a toy and I fear it works like one, too. It's cute, small, almost like a dame watch, and it feels like you don't have anything on your wrist. So, if that's what you search for, go ahead. Anyway, the price is almost ridiculous, so expect just what you pay for."
3,Pretty watch needs work.,"- it's a pretty watch but...- it doesn't show the date on the face with the time.- the digital display is necessarily small, but it is too small, non-the-less.- there is an inconsistency in how the buttons work:- usually, in Casio watches, the hard-to-reach button is the one used to set things.- on this watch, it is the button used to advance the analog time dial.- the dial only moves forward, so it takes too long to do for an American. (joke)- i wore out my Casio Data Bank. i'm going get another one.doneastwest."
1,bad band,"The band was, to me, unusable. And, I was unable to cancel this transaction ten minutes after making the order, thus had to send it back after it got here."
4,great watch for the money,I bough this watch nearly 3 years ago and it still looks pretty good. I have been on a lot of construction jobs and been in the lake swimming and have even gotten a complement on it's looks in a store checkout line.
1,DESIGN FLAW,"Like others, the arm that has the pinhole cracked with very gentle wear. From what I can see, it cannot be repaired. So, now the watch still works, but it can't be worn. Since this happened to others, it appears to be a design flaw. Other Casios that I have, have different style arms and appear to be sturdier, and have not broken with the same kind of wear as the Forester."
2,Worked great for 6 months....then broke!,I loved the watch at first. But then one day the band completely ripped open. Nothing even happened- I was walking along when I realized that my watch was loose inside my jacket sleeve. The band was completely ripped where it wrapped around the clasp. Just from regular daily use!
5,Great little watch.,"Nice light weight watch & comfortable to wear. Back light extremely helpful; easy to tell time in the dark. Watch has all the features I wanted: date, white face, military time, back light & canvass strap. Happy with purchase. I'm in construction so it's a great everyday watch to wear to work in lieu of wearing your Rolex. LOL, who needs a Rolex when the return on this is so much more at a great price. Did I mention affordable?"
4,mens watch,"-good looking watch. velcro straps are nice for my husband who works out in the field all the time.-nice colors- is holding up well so far, seems durable."
2,Bad color cast. Beware!,"I really like the cokin P system to make filter use and changes easy. Much simpler than screwing a threaded round filter on and off between each shot. However, I tried stacking two ""neutral"" density filters together however and ended up with very bad pink color cast. Made the pictures unusable. I've read the same happens with the Z series as well. Too bad. Spent a lot of money and now the filters are useless to me. Would have saved money going with better filters from the beginning."
2,Lawercide:,"I found this quite boring and failed to stay interested. Perhaps it got better as it went along, but I lost patience and gave up."
3,Joan Mitchell deserves better,"This DVD has as its subject perhaps the greatest abstract expressionist of the second generation: Joan Mitchell. It's a pity that the makers did not have enough expertise to hire a cinematographer who knows how to photograph art, or an editor who understands that the viewer wants to look at the works at length. Most of the pictures not only are shown too briefly, but, unpardonably, are often not in sharp focus."
1,"Nope, not this one either...Nothing by Ruth McClendon",I have read this book and it makes things look hopeful. If you want reading that makes you realize more about family business than it is a good book. If you have real family business problems and are looking for help...find a different book!
2,Not as Great as I remembered!,"Video quality was good. When I watched this video for the first time since my childhood, sadly it was not as great as I remembered it to be."
5,The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen in my Whole Entire Life!,"I love this movie! The world has been waiting for billions of years just for its inhabitents to witness this film! I hope everyone buys this and watches it every day! this video has been and will always be the highlight of my life. Seriously guys, who doesn't love talking bunnies and their exciting lives; that's what i'd like to know. All i can tell you is WATCH THIS MOVIE! Believe me, it is better for the soul than chocolate!"
2,"Looks great from the table of contents, till you actually read it","I bought this before a monthlong trip to MT hoping it would be a good resource. The author has bitten off more than he can chew--too shallow, not authoritative, and not the book I thought it would be"
2,"Nails are great, but packaging/shipping not so..","The way this is packaged, you kind of have to take out all the nails in order to get what you need to load into the nailer's cartridge. Unless you have no need to use the box to store unused nails. Not only that, you will find the nails to be in pieces from the shipping, but then again the packaging didn't help also. So as long as you are willing to do multiple loads of those broken nails into the cartridge, you will want to get the nails from like Anchor brand."
3,"Nice, but the constant ads for WOTC were annoying","I picked this up based on reviews I've read about an earlier edition. As a relatively new dungeon master who is about to launch my own 4th Edition campaign I thought this book could be helpful.To be positive, the book was helpful in a lot of places. However there were a number of places, such as the section where the book discusses creating adventures, where I felt the book could have gone into more detail.However what turned me off this book was the constant advertising spam the authors inserted for other WOTC D&D; products. This annoyed me for three reasons. Firstly, a lot of the promotions were out of context with regards the material being discussed. Secondly, at times they interrupted the flow of the topic the authors were writing about and lastly they pushed the same product over and over again.All in all the book contains some good advice, but it is overshadowed by a large amount of unnecessary advertising."
5,A great book for beginner and intermediate DMs,"As much as I hated the other book in this set, this one was wonderful. It provided a solid layout of what a DM might run into and what he'd have to handle. It gives detailed examples for not just adventures, but interplayer problems that often crop up as well. I've been DMing for years, but I've got my copy of this well tagged with sticky notes. Sure I technically have most of the info in my other books, but this one is far easier to referance when players are waiting for an answer. Anyone that wants to run a game would do well to buy this helpful book."
2,Black & Decker Gizmo Can Opener,"I bought this unit to replace an old B&D rechargeable can opener that had finally croaked after many years of faithful, flawless service. That model mounted flat on my kitchen wall. Unfortunately it has been discontinued, so I bought the B&D Gizmo opener as an approximate replacement. When I received it, I discovered that it requires an under-cabinet mounting location, but I don't have one available. This important fact was omitted from all of the several descriptions of the product that I had read at various websites. So my new opener is sitting on - and wasting - my precious counter space. With a modest amount of effort B&D could easily have made the base unit mountable either on the wall or under a cabinet, but they didn't. I would not buy this again."
5,SUPER OPENER !,"This opener is so handy! It was bought for an elderly lady who has problems with holding items...She just LOVES this baby! It opens the cans for her and it is so light weight, she is able to hold it for that short amount of time needed to get it on the can.. A breeze to put back on it's base, it is non obtrusive also in the kitchen! I reccomend it !"
4,What is History without Bias?,"To tell you the truth, yes this book is tedious. If you are interested in History, especially on the American Revolution I think that Dr. Bodle discusses a very well presented arguement between the ""Real Struggle"" in the Revolution between Morristown and Valley Forge. The Author has a specialized knowledge about the Campaign in Pennsylvania. I have had him for 2 classes being Colonial America and American Revolution. He shows his in depth knowledge of the ideology of social, economical and political aspects of the struggle known as the American Revolution in this book. In short...If you want to learn a wider vision of the Revolution...you would like the ideas from this book. If you can not take the pressure then watch the history channel!"
2,Historical Misunderstanding for Many Readers,"As an avid war historian with notable interest in the Civil War, I believe this book may leave people with a somewhat jaded view of the War itself. Especially those that have not studied the actual history before, during, and after the War. I understand and appreciate the depth of research that went into this book. I also understand that the author tried to present actual testamonies rather than personal opinion. However, the format of the book will leave many thinking that the War was only about slavery and periferal support of that cause."
2,Thoughtful point of view but overly negative focus on south,I encourage reading and evaluating various points of view and i agree with the overall premise about the cause of the war but feel like the interpretation of the facts was focused on makeing southerners appear hateful and dumb.
3,"Difficult to follow, unless you are familiar with the era.","This book is interesting and kind of sucks at the same time. If you aren't familiar with U.S. history then you aren't going to have any idea what is going on. The 20 page intro is so hard to get through it makes you want to return the book. But if history is your thing, good luck. Otherwise I wouldn't suggest reading this book for leisure."
4,A very good book,"This book is very well written and exciting. I recomend this book for older readers, especially girls."
5,Very Good,"i love dear america books so i got this one right after it cameout. this book is about a african american girl named Nellie Lee Love. she lived in Bradford Corners, Tennesse, but after her uncle told Nellie's dad about Chicago and all the obertutities her family decited to move there. this is a very good book if you want to read about african american families in the early 1900's."
4,Very Engaging,"Historically accurate,interesting, honest and a good addition to the series. Can be enjoyed by young and old alike."
3,The Prophecies of St. Malachy,"The book was not what it seemed to be. I was very disappointed in the overall content. Hopefuffy there will be others writers and editors to publish their books,"
4,Great collection!,"Wiley Miller has become one of my favorite cartoonists. He's one of those unusual cartoonists who uses both continuing characters with a storyline and non-character gags in the same strip. He's also more than a little political, which may not be to everyone's tastes.This book gathers the strips featuring Danae, cunning and willful daughter out to get her own way, and her horse, Lucy. Laugh out loud funny social satire at its best! (A personal favorite: Danae trying to shock her father by wanting to go door to door to Jehovah's Witnesses and preach the joys of joining the Taliban.)"
2,disappointment,I've beena fan of Coldcut for sometime but this new album is nowhere near the quality of prior release. gone are the cut-ups and abstract hip hop feel. these are all traditional songs. the main problem is their choice of singers and lameness of the songs sung. An instrumental version of this cd would be much better. I listened to it maybe twice and will most likely not dig it out again. I've tried to like it but it justs sounds too much like their trying to be played on the radio.
4,Its not that bad,"When i first heard of this album i rushed to my nearest store and let my ears listen to the wonderful sound that cold cut produces. The music is full of different types of electronica, and really shows off what the cold cut crew can produce. Thier songs not only have greate beat and tamber, but some even tell a story.after hearing this well thought out album, it looks like cold cut has another fan."
1,not worthy of a ninja,"I love most everything Ninja Tune issues, from Amon Tobin to Roots Manuva. So I naturally thought that Coldcut would release something worthy. But the boys lost the thread on this one. This is a CD of tired collaborations, like late period BB King or Tony Bennett. There's not an original sound or beat on the entire thing. ""Sound Mirrors"" has cut-out bin written all over it, although I guess that's a dated concept itself."
3,GREAT BOOK-- BUT.........,"This IS an excellent, clever and VERY informative book-- touching not only on some of the lesser known events leading up to the Constitutional Convention, but on the ways (considering events that the Founding Fathers could NEVER have envisioned) the enduring Constitution has been called upon in those past 3 centuries, to right and redress wrongs.However, although the subject matter is unique and informative, and the artwork is clever, the artist's penmanship is spiky, hard to read at any type of measured pace, and it gave me headache upon headache to read this book through. A revised edition with Actual Typeface in those ""balloons"" would be enormously helpful."
5,Husband Loved it!,"I bought this book for my husband for Xmas. He loved it. His great, great,grandfather was at camp Douglas during the Civil War and there had only been a mere mention of it in his family. The book came in a timely fashion and was in great condition"
5,We are fortunate to have this release.......,high-end equipment will unleash the soundstage and marvel at the detail and depth. Pump some power to Martin-Logans or their equivalents and sit back and have a sonic thrill. Recommended.
5,History of Western Philosophy,"A most comprehensive overciew of the great philosophical minds of the Western World. It gives not only the philosophical stance of each, but puts them in their respective contexts, of the history and politics of the era. Russell's prose style is both lucid and informative. This is a wonderful reference book for the keen philosopher and even for those starting to explore the beginning and development of this stimulating field of enquiry.J.McD"
3,Makita product dealt quality,Bought this set to match my drill set and they looked sharp but the rubber started sliding off and metal tube come out. It's a good product if you are a weekend warrior but you do heavy commercial/industrial pay the money and get something better or just buy the dewalt one at HD with having to wait.
5,So far so good....,"I use these constantly. So far the sleeve stays in place (doesn't slide on it's own). If you haven't used one before - get one! I have had Dewalt in the past. Either one is fine for normal projects. The Dewalt was a champ when I was building decking all day with 3"" skrews. I have not pushed Makita to the limits yet."
3,Not really helpful,"This product is okay, but not often very useful. I find that only one of the phillips head bits actually fits nearly all screws, though I suppose the skinny and fat ones may be occasionally useful."
1,there are better books on roses,"As listed above, this book is spiral-bound making it difficult to read at best. You have to continually turn the book from side-to-side to see what the authors are telling you. This layout was horrible. Organization of subjects to discuss wasn't the best either.The pictures are clear and there is plenty of information on the subject: propagating, correct pruning, and even flower arranging. I just thought that there was too much information for the readers for the amount of pages within the book.The only way I could recommend this book is if you collect garden or rose books. If you want a super book on roses get The American Rose Society Encyclopedia of Roses."
5,Captivating Read,"Could not put this book down! The author really knows how to tell a tale! The honesty in his writing style and the events of his life in becoming an award-winning journalist, and almost being executed by the Vietnamese, long after the war was over is amazing. The author really knows his craft!And for a person like me who only read books on historical events, Cork Graham ran me right through it: it felt as though he were right beside me and telling me the tale and I could imagine everything in total technicolor!If you want to get the whole story on Vietnam, you have to read Stanley Karnow's ""Vietnam: A History"" and then right after ""The Bamboo Chest: An Adventure in Healing the Trauma of War"" To miss out on either is to be misinformed!"
4,Good View from a non-Viet,"""The Bamboo Chest"" is a worthwhile read from the point of a American. For another great read, get ""Catfish and Mandala"" by a Viet-American, the story of a young man who went back to Vietnam, while on cycling trip around the world and has an opportunity to see his history in a new, more modern light."
3,layer upon layer,"I wish they had 1/2 stars, because this is more than a 3 and I can be very critical in my reading. This is a very deep book! I have read it three times since I received it for Christmas. There are so may layers of information: conscious, subconscious, political, socialogical, historical. The author has put a great deal of thought into his words and how they affect the reader in an inspiring tale of overcoming challenges that has made me look only at how I approach the dilemmas that have littered my world, but also the simple little things in this world that in contrast have that much more an impact, like our everday interactions with family, friends, and employees. As said, I received The Bamboo Chest as a gift. It has become my 'go to' book to buy for friends and family who love to read dramatic books/memoirs that leave the heart uplifted."
4,Controversy Speaks,"It is finally good to read a book by someone who has spent more than a few months in Vietnam, five years should teach anyone much about a people, especially if they were fluent in Vietnamese at one time. As a Vietnamese-American with an American father and Vietnamese mother I enjoyed this book by an author with parents from two different cultures. Travelling often to visit my relatives in Ho Chi Minh City, I consider myself a good judge of books and found this book along with ""Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam"" by Andrew X. Pham to be worth adding to any library on South East Asia and Vietnam. I see by reading the reviews below that ""The Bamboo Chest"" has controvery I guess any book that can command that deserves to once again be an Amazon bestseller, LOL!"
3,incredible story,"purchased this book after reading a recommendation at the ""killing fields"" movie section. was not sure what i'd be getting because i had seen others recommend it. happy that it was truly a good read. starts off with the author realizing that life is not right for him and that perhaps he needs to go back to the area of his childhood. arrives in thailand with the objective of becoming a photojournalist (absurd considering he had no previous training). what he lacks in skills he makes up for with chutzpah and even starts getting assignments from the associated press. one day meets a british actor who has become a treasure hunter. the brit convinces graham to go to vietnam, the land of his childhood, to search for capt. kidd's treasure but instead becomes political prisoner. if you like political intrigue, asian history, self-discovery, and traveling the path least traveled, this is a good book."
4,Real Page Turner!!,"Never thought a book about post-traumatic stress disorder could hold my attention like a thriller, but that's exactly what this is and what it did! I'm sure with the renewed public interest, evidenced by the 3 part feature run by Ted Koppel on ABC News' Nightline a few days ago, this book is going to really take off! Not that I've ever been attracted to the topic of Vietnam, PTSD, photojournalist, or even treasure hunting in the least; but, my wife purchased the book and each of us read couldn't put it down until we got to the end. If this is an average example of Mr. Graham's writing, I can't wait for the second installment in his memoir trilogy!"
1,The Bamboo Chest,"I can't help but wonder if Amazon has a problem with authors, publishers or friends writing glowing reviews to promote a product. Otherwise I can not imagine what prompted the multiple raves for The Bamboo Chest. The writer seems juvenile and incapable of the adventures he describes, and I was unable to know his characters beyond appearances and conversations. I gave up at 100 pages, still uncertain regarding the origin of the much referred to post traumatic stress syndrome. Living in Vietnam during the war? Or was it the tragedy that struck on the river boat? Adding insult to injury: Neither author or editor know correct language (English)usage, as evidenced by the frequent use of ""lay"" for ""lie"" as in ""I lay on the bed."" Verydisappointing, especially since I will soon visit Vietnam for a month and am eager for background."
3,Grammar problems??,"I normally don't comment, but after having seen this book recommended, and following the link and reading the emberassingly ignorant and ill-educated comment by the self-proclaimed critic at large, I had to. Lay/lie? That reviewer needs to go back to school and take a grammar class! And she's using this book as a travel guide?? That speaks volumes. This is no travel guide to Vietnam. If it is, I'd question the marbles rolling around in the head of anyone who would use this as such. This a book about Vietnam from 1968 to 1972 and from 1983 to 1999. These were not the best years of Vietnam, and I hope that soon they do get those great years! I used this book for my Asian studies paper because it told a refreshing story and the history was outstanding, something my professor agreed with by making it the reading requirement for his undegrads."
1,This is total bull!,I used a search engine and found the book's website. I read the back cover and it says that the Vietnamese Embassy spokesman says it is a lie is all a lie in this book! Don't buy this book!! I can understand now why someone would recommend this book at Unfit for Command: total propoganda! The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is the best government for the people!
2,Good to average spectacle; Terrible pan-scan DVD transfer,"Not historically accurate movie. However, the widescreen specatacle is impressive. Often cut, this version is almost complete running 136 minutes. The original Cinerama release version was 140 minutes. The brief US release in 1969 was 120 min. The print utilized for this Simitar DVD is torn and tattered. It is pan/scan, probaly a worn TV print. This movie needs better source materials and a wide screen transfer. Don't waste your money on Simitar junk."
4,Custer of the West DVD Review,"Overall, this is an entertaining film with good acting and script. Unfortunately, the widescreen DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs. This is a film; those who want to study history, should refer to books."
3,MGM has gone BAD!,"MGM is releasing older films in widescreen (which is good )but not Enhanced For Widescreen T.V.'s ( Anamorphic )which is very bad.Along with ""Custer Of The West"" titles include ""Follow That Dream"", ""The Magnificent Seven Ride!"", ""Shalako"" and ""A Minute To Pray, A Second To Die"". There are sure to be others. Why is MGM doing this? The only reason I can think of is to save money. If no one buys these DVD's maybe it would get through to them that this is unacceptable. If you feel the same way as I do send MGM an email."
3,"MGM, please keep in touch with the times!","It seems hardly acceptable that in 2004 some studios still release widescreen DVDs without 16:9 enhancement. Well, this is the flaw that will bring my rating down to 3 stars. Too bad, because this DVD is otherwise nice-looking. And - oh yes, in case you're wondering - don't let the inaccurate mention on the jacket fool you: the film is presented in its correct 70 mm 2,20:1 aspect ratio, not in 1,85:1. Please MGM, also double-check your jackets!"
3,Epic Western that Fails,"I just recently purchased the widescreen addition of ""Custer"" and I have to say it's not too bad really. The only thing that annoys me is the poor Music score, it sounds so European, No melody nothing to compliment the Cinerama spectacle it trys to convey. Robert Shaw gives a fair performance, but not brilliant. Widescreen print is fair, sound is also average (stereo). A little dissapointed overall, as I remember this film being much better when I first saw it aged 7."
4,You thought you KNEW George Custer,"The more we investigate the more we learn that the Errol Flynn Custer epic ""they died with their boots on"" was a boxoffice hit but a historical miss. Now Robert Shaw would not be on my list of actors to portray General Custer. But great actors can sometimes surprise you and rise up to the challenge. He does. And this little known movie is as close as you are gonna get to the REAL TRUTH about George Armstrong Custer. Some real memorable lines.And another plus is a very good sound track with a marching tune you can't get out of your head. For the price hey, take a chance."
4,Sally Hansen Nail Spray,I like the product and would buy it again. I take it to my manicurist and give it to him to spray on my nails so my nail polish does not smear.
4,very nice,the product is not the one shown in the picture buyer beware. however they are Iowa mate just without the word. I bought them for my buddy's truck he drives a dodge rumble bee which has a black and yellow color scheme. these floor mats match the scheme perfectly and he loved them. the mats have a very soft fell and are very tough for carpeted floor mats. i only gave it a 4 because the mats are not the one in the picture but still awesome mats.
5,I Love this DVD,This yoga DVD is refreshing and inspirational. I have many yoga DVD's and this one captures the sprit of being at a yoga studio with a experienced teacher. Janet is wonderful and authentic. Her practice is flowing and beautiful. It is nice to have a DVD that is beginner friendly but challenging and interesting for an experienced practitioner. Enjoy!
4,Great book for students and teachers of art & therapy,"Art for all the Children is a great book simply because it focuses on children with disabilities. It provides detailed information on a vast majority of disabilities, their causes, and ways in which art therapy can help. It offers case studies and even sample IEPs. I found this book to be essential if working with this population or in the art field."
4,Thin Paper,"I am very happy with the value however, the print from the backside of a page can be seen slightly through to the page you are reading. I'm sure this is nothing that will be ""fixed."" I suspect the cover and binding will wear out if used too heavily. For me this is no problem since this is one of many bibles that I have and keep this one at home. Blessings"
3,Nice Type but Quite Bulky Bible,"This edition of the New American Standard is the best type set I have seen. It comes in a perfect 14 point print that is easy to read and follow. The Bible is in verse format and is offset by dark numbers when a new subect falls in the text. The words of Christ are in red letters which I prefer in black. This edition does not have cross references although a few do appear at the end of the verses but not many.The negative side of this edition is the size. It is big and bulky. You might enjoy having this Bible for study next to your bed or in your office but for Bible teachers this Bible is not for you. It's weight will wear you down. Zondervan makes the giant print in a personal size (much smaller than this edition) however they do not have it in any genuine leather formats. Bonded leather is cheap, fast, but not durable. I hope Zondervan will in the future release a personal size of this 14 point type Bibles."
5,Love the large print,This is a wonderful edition. The large print makes it so much easier to read. I didn't have any problems with the paper thinness. It was about the same as for other Bibles. I the main think I like is the more literal translations.
5,Handy but readable for vain folks,"Who wants to wear bifocals of any kind? Not me! I can conveniently carry this, and I can read it well enough without changing glasses."
5,Amazing Orchestral Work!!! Phantom music without singing!,"I had been looking for a CD of just the music of the Phantom and this is exactly that. Just the music, no singing. It was done by the London Symphony Orchestra so it was superb! It sounds just like the 2004 movie version without the singing. Get both CD's, movie version and this without the singing. Really worth it if you love Phantom! I've also bought a few other ""just the music, no singing versions"" of the Phantom but this rates way above the rest.I completely agree with the other review that this definitely needs to be performed live, I think so many people would love to go see it. You won't be disappointed with this CD."
5,A Great Read!!!,"If you have been to Cisnes,Patagonia (or want to go there) this is a must book to read. I spent 10 days in this area in February, 2002 and saw some of the people that Nick writes about. In reading the book Nick made me feel that I was back there as I could visualize where the events were taking place. The changes to Coyhaique have continued since 1999 as I found it to be a very modern town. After reading this book I would like to make a return trip."
5,A book you won't forget,"If you cherish the ways in which John McPhee and Barry Lopez make meaning out of landscape, if you appreciate a writer with an observant heart and a feel for language, and if you wonder how people manage to live--for well and for ill--in a world turned inside out, this is the book for you. By turns harrowing, hilarious, and touching, ""The Last Cowboys"" will command your attention and remain in your thoughts long after you have read the last page."
1,Liked this book,"I liked the book very much because I was traveling to Chile and Argentina and the book is all about the gauchos in those countries. I read it while traveling there and it helped me understand the country, the land and the people who live there."
1,Language nightmare,"Anyone who knows Spanish will be tormented by Reding's book as he insists on translating even NAMES to English. He translates idiomatic expressions in Spanish into non-idiomatic (thus nonsensical) English! Grrr...... He does not give a glossary of terms or any footnotes. If you speak even un poquito de espanol, this will frustrate you very much. I could not finish the book."
3,Blue Highways meets South America. Way south.,"This book is an exploration/travelogue by a fishing guide-cum-author who went to Patagonia to experience the lifestyle of the ""last"" cowboys. While it's pretty entertaining, and written well, it just didn't hold my interest after the first hundred pages or so. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if it was shorter."
1,Gauchos are not chilean,"This is just to correct a gross mistake from one of the other reviewers. Gauchos are the archetypical argentine country men, not chilean. and Patagonia is argentinean in more than 90% of its extension.Gaucho literature is almost exclusively argentinian. An obligatory introduction to the world of gauchos is José Hernández' Martin Fierro. See this book first to get a glance at the gaucho's rough life before embarking in a second-hand misleading historiography."
2,Not very informative,"Prima used to put out excellent strategy guides, but this was very sub-par. I would have liked to have seen the use of numbers in damage and armor of the units, but instead you get the same description as is in the manual. This book doesn't go into a whole lot of detail, but then again, the campaigns are not overly difficult so there's not a whole lot to say...The Game itself is AWESOME...but I'd suggest playing it first to determine if you really need this guide..."
4,"""Physician in training? Yea, right!","The young lad who wrote the previous review has obviously not taken an embryology course yet. If so, he would have realized his error. Ahh, mother Virginia, what doth ye teacheth your children? The last review, from the peonic freshman biology student, should be disregarded. Next year, he'll change his mind."
1,Know the Facts First,"The 'viewer' from Charlottesville was right... the fetus cannot scream.Link to here and read what real scientists found wrong with the movie (a lot).http://www.plannedparenthood.org/abortion/silentscream.HTM""Bradford McCall"", who wrote this: The young lad who wrote the previous review has obviously not taken an embryology course yet. If so, he would have realized his error. Ahh, mother Virginia, what doth ye teacheth your children? The last review, from the peonic freshman biology student, should be disregarded. Next year, he'll change his mind....offers no refutation, only condescension! This movie should have been thrown out years ago, yet anti-abortionists still tout it as 'proof' of a fetus suffering during an abortion.If the previous viewer from Sacramento really is an MD, then maybe he needs to go back to school and recall that fetuses in utero have no voluntary movement but REFLEX MOVEMENT ONLY. A 12-week fetus cannot think, be afraid or especially scream. Get the facts."
2,My own high-and-mighty review,"I find it interesting that nobody who has had an abortion has offered any input on this film yet. A lot of people seem to enjoy offering their opinions on something they a) have never experienced or b) do not have the medical background in to express and informed argument. This film is propaganda; it is as simple as that. Regardless of what you feel on this subject, it is doubtful that this film will do more than pander to already biased views. Please excuse my arrogance (or don't, I care not) but as a biochemist, I find the moral high ground many folks take on this matter to be laughable at best. While I am sure that many of you out there are conspiracy theorists, I find it highly unlikely that the medical institution would allow abortion to continue as practice if it did indeed cause suffering on the level this video purports it to (and I doubt it does)."
1,disaster,This sets a record for biased presentation.It is a shame to pollute the discussionwith such refuse.
3,Okay...,"This is a good movie for pro-life and border line people. It is also educational. I think that it would have been better with today's technology. But, I still think that this is great and revolutionary for the time it was produced in."
4,wasnt as good as eclipse of reason.,"Asa doctor, bernard nathanson had a change of heart at the advent of the ultrasound because he could see what an abortion really was. This video unfortunately wasnt clear enough for me, but it certainly was explained well."
4,LIBERTY & BASH,"The movie: Liberty & Bash, is a B rated movie. In its' full version (not on VHS), the movie had a much better solid plot, but with it's version on VHS the movie, in my opionion, has lost some of it's parts' of the original movie; however, it still is a classy movie if you've ever been one who has ever been abused or bullied.It is with this idea in mind, that it's nice to know that there is always someone who is there to give us a good chance of knowing that someone is there to make the odds even and that justice provales'. Yes, maybe I am somewhat of a perfectionist, but I still feel that this movie is worth having been added to your movie library. Enjoy!NOTE: Bodybuilder, Lou Ferrigno (The Incredible Hulk series) is stone deaf; for his overcoming many odds against his becoming a movie star via learning to speak English inspite never having actually heard it's sound, gives this movie a cutting ege. Congratulations' to you, Lou Ferrigon."
4,A Thrilling Read,"Geology is not usually one of my favorite topics. I remember slogging through John McPhee's interminable series of articles for The New Yorker and vowing to avoid the topic at all costs.My attitude has changed radically since reading Kevin Krajick's book Barren Lands. Somehow, he has managed to convert a dry topic into a thrilling adventure narrative, weaving hundreds of years of history into this story about the idiosyncratic characters who prospect for diamonds.I highly value my sleep, but I actually stayed up late to finish this book. My only criticism is that I would have liked to see photographs of the driven, eccentric characters that populate the book, and the actual landscape they prospected."
4,Revised review,"On October 17,2001, I submitted a harsh and critical review of Barren Lands, by Kevin Krajick, which is still being presented by Amazon.com. After discussions with the author and others, I regret the too negative tone of my review and now wish to modify my comments to reflect my much more favorable opinion of the work and its intregrity. I hope that visitors to this web site will discount my earlier comments.Sincerely,John S. White"
1,Should be considered fiction!,"In many ways this book is a fraud. The writer has recklessly exaggerated the history and the science of diamonds in such a manner that it would hardly be acceptable in fiction, but this is presented as a true tale. It is so loaded with distortions and errors, ever poor writing, that I find it amazing that the dust cover carries praise from what would, on first blush, appear to be reliable reviewers. On second blush, I am not so sure.I am still plowing through this awful thing, but am flagging questionable passages on just about every other page. That is, only the things that I know are incorrect or shamelessly distorted. It is quite clear that Times Books/Henry Holt/ WH Freeman never vetted the text of this book before publishing it.I was the former curator of the mineral and gem collection at the Smithsonian before retiring in 1991 so I know a little about the subject...."

5,Just a wonderful watch,"I've always been a fan of gadget watches. Well this one takes the cake. I get more complements about this watch then any other one I've had. I took it to the jeweler to size it and his first words were, ""Man, that's an interesting watch.""You will really like the temperature gauge once you calibrate it for the temperature of your body. You can always just take it off and wait a few minutes for the temperature of the room, but I like instant temp. Took about a month to finally get the temperature correct using the temperature change feature.The other feature I use often is the world time. It has the time for everywhere in the world. Once you set up the watch, it's just click the button and go. Very simple directions in the booklet.For this low price, I should really buy two. All my other watches were 4 times this price."
1,Very Disappointing,"-Watch is much heavier then I expected, to the point of being uncomfortable-The digital part of the watch does not stay ""lit up"" at all times. You must push the light button to see the digital display, unlike most digital watches. I can't even see the display during the daylight without using the light.-The hands often block the digital display-I can't adjust the band to make it smaller, and I am a really big guy. I probably need to visit a jeweler.What a bummer."
2,It's a waste,"If you like watches, you better stay away from this product.It costs $50 for a reason.I bought it for a dirty environment like riding, camping, etc., but was very disappointed.Thermometer doesn't really work on your wrist.Very cheap bracelet.Not a good fit for a mature man's wrist.I was too lazy to return it, so I found a better solution. I gave it to my friend's son. I've learned it became a great toy for him.So, I guess 10-15 year old kids can be happy with the watch.Still rate it low letting kids speak for themselves."
4,"Good value, great product","In a day and age where watches are fashion accessories this is a good watch. While I have a couple of Swiss Watches, including a T-Touch and a Longines, this is a stylish cheap watch that does not look out of place in a suit as well as casual wear. Not the easiest watch to work in terms of the buttons and a super small manual makes learning how to use it a bit tricky. It's smaller than I expected which is not a bad thing. But overall at the price who can complain. It's fun."
5,Quality and value,"Case is heavy stainless steel. Though the description doesn't mention it, the bracelet is also stainless. It uses the same ""stepping"" movement from the early twincept watches - if it is half as accurate as those it will always stay synchronized with the digital part.What the above reviewers said about the LCD background is true. It does not look like the picture (which is more like an illustration anyway). Like all other inverse LCD screens I've seen, it is dim - but that is so the analog portion of the watch is the first thing your eye catches when it looks down. I was more worried that the LCD background would be pronounced to the extent that I would have to visually hunt for the analog hands, but this has not been the case, which is a plus in my book.Also, the watch is not oversized, like so many ""fashion"" men's watches are. It is a sensible, standard size - like a Rolex datejust. If you want to wear a diver-size watch with a coat and tie, this would be a bad choice."
3,difficult read,"A great quality watch, the only problem is the face is impossible to read. The hands block the digital read-out, the digital part is microscopic small and the hands are difficult to focus on due to the numerous digital info. A great watch if your not constantly looking for the time... Great dress watch but tough on the eyes for everyday use..."
3,Nice watch but design is poor,The watch is nice but the design of the numbers in the background is unuseful.The temperature is not well measured but the looking of the watch is nice.The buttons are easy to press.
3,Takes some getting used to,"I've had this watch for a couple of weeks and I have mostly enjoyed it. However, the time is sometimes a bit difficult to read with a quick glance. The thermometer is really more of a novelty than a useful feature. Since it is attached to your arm, the temperature is skewed by your body heat. The instructions say to take the watch off and leave it for twenty minutes to get an accurate temperature reading. Who wants to do that?"
1,Loser Watch,"I bought this watch for my husband, the weather freak. It was one of the few I could find that has a thermometer. When he got it he spent days reading the tiny instruction booklet, but could not even set the time on it. I tried also. We tried to set other functions and could not figure any of them. I'd like to return it, but we purchased it in July, so I guess it's too late. We're stuck with a loser watch!Carol"
2,Casio Men's Ana-Digi Edifice Thermometer Bracelet Watch #EFA120D-1AV,"I got this watch for my brother but it was returned as he had much trouble trying to get the watch regulated. Out of frustration he asked me to return the watch, which I did."
2,Thermometer?,Not quite sure what the thermometer function was supposed to do. It appears that the temp. it shows is a combination of outside temp. and body temp.Who needs that?
1,Dead Battery,Everything went very smoothly for this purchase until the watch battery died the same day I rec'd the watch...now I have to get the battery replaced.
2,Looked great...but I had to send it back.,"This watch looked great and was pretty comfortable.But the digital display was difficult to see. It was much dimmer than is pictured.Also, the crystal is higher than the surrounding bezel and it is not protected by the bezel at all. The round faced version of this watch (EFA119BK-1AV) has a recessed crystal that is protected by the bezel.So, 5 stars for how it looks and -3 stars for the rest = 2 stars."
3,"Nice features, but, too difficult to read","I was impressed with the features and styling on this watch.The features include: Tilt sensor back light, world time, dual time, temperature sensor, etc, etc.All this stuff for a meager price.However, when I got it, I found the digital display extremely hard to read.Even with the back light on, you can read it in a certain orientation.I bought this watch particularly for the world time function (which is part of the digital display) because I travel between time zones.But, I had to return it. Too bad it did not work out."
5,Excelent,I love it.perfect size. Very elegant and cute. it seems like an expensive watch.Definitely an excellent bought.it has only one problem. Its difficult to configure the firs time however not a big deal.
3,Mixed Feelings,"I like and dislike this watch. It is very heavy on the wrist, and rides up and down all day, rubbing my arm and pulling hair out (w/ metal band). It feels too tight in the summer, and is too cold on my arm in the winter. The latch system is bulky and overcomplicated, but hasn't failed. The face looks cheaper when you get up close to it. Setting it is rather byzantine - press one button six times to reset the time! There are many features, which somehow amuse me even when I don't need them - like the thermometer. The alarm - which is easily set or un-set by accidental bumps - is nice. At midnight it goes off in doubled rings, for some reason. The booklet, mostly in multiple languages, is not great. Wish the leather band version was a similar price. Probably won't get it again."
4,Worth the price,"I ordered this witch Amazon.com using FREE with Super SaverShipping, ,it arrived in just two (2) days time.I find it is a bit heavy and thicker than I expected.The watch looks pretty decent, however as alludedto by another reviewer the black face does make it kindof difficult to see the time and as stated by anotherthe hands can block the digital display sometimes.All in all it is good value for moneykalip"
4,Pretty good,"It's what I expected altho, being a multi-functioning watch, takes a learning curve to get up to speed."
3,Smaller than the picture,"The only claim that i have it is smaller than looks in the picture, could be because I'm a big men that why to me is a little bit petti.Nice model and feel it compact."
3,A watch is not just a watch,The watch works well it the damn instructions in minute print that are a problem as is the ability to read some of the small items on the dial face. If you wear reading glasses this probably is not the watch for you.
4,Great watch,Expensive looks but setting the date and time can be tricky. Reading the manual of this watch can be painful as well. Overall it's a great watch for $50.00.
3,reasonable watch,good looking but very thick. Belt is very nice in design. Operations are bit complicated to remember. Overall good watch
4,One of the better looking digital watches,"I bought this watch as a gift for my brother who specifically wanted a better looking digital watch to wear to work. Out of the countless watches I looked at, this Casio was the best one (and it's round twin) under $100. It has most of the desired features in a digital: alarm, stopwatch, timer. It also has a temperature meter but I wonder about it's accuracy. In any case, the digital readout is very difficult to see in the light of day. At night, a push of the illumination button makes it easy to see. The band looks OK but is cheap rolled steel with no attempt made to polish/brush the sides to conceal that fact. All in all, a decent watch that stands out in looks compared to other budget digital watches."
3,Beautiful on the outside; utility quite limited,"Casio Men's Ana-Digi Edifice Bracelet Watch #EFA120D-1AVThe outside appearance of the watch is gorgeous. But, the digital numbers are too dim, too small, and too frequently covered up by the analog hands thereby reducing the watch's utility. And, it is the most difficult and arcane watch to set the time, date, etc. than any other watch I have ever owned. The owners manual is not terribly helpful either, and written by someone whose first language was probably not English. All in all, I have found it a beautiful disappointment; a watch which will spend more time in a sock drawer than ever on my wrist."
1,Not worth it,The watch looks better in the pictures. The digital numbers are difficult to read. The tempeture reading is never correct since it is always high when you are wearing the watch. and it is heavier than most watches twice the size. Bad choice. Gave it 1 stars since it does keep time.
4,Nice watch,"Very nice watch. It is a little bit too heavy, but the overall performance is good except for the thermometer which sometimes shows a incorrect temperature. Also, the backlight may be a little to light for some places outside and inside."
5,nice watch!,"Just recently purchased this watch, so far it work great, manual presented in quite detail, it look nice, can be as dress or sport watch. Digital display a bit dim, although you should have no probsfor outdoor usage. For watch under 50 dollars this watch is excellent. A bit confusing to calibrate the temp, but once you know the trick it will be alright. 5 star for product in overall."
4,An ok watch,"It a cool watch with a thermometer, the size is ok for those who don't like big watches but it is a little complected to set the right time and might take more time to understand it."
5,Lots of great info.,"I bought the magazine about ten times last year so this year I subscribed. This magazine is awesome. Lots of info about worldwide diving spots, gear reviews, hotel/resort reviews... it's full of great info and awesome pictures. Plus it's pretty cheap compared to other diving magazines."
3,I wish I could,"I've subscribed to SCUBA Diving before and liked it, and I wish I could present an opinion about its current format. Sadly, almost two months after ordering and paying for a subscription, I have yet to receive an issue."
4,Very Good Insights,"This book was an excellent insight into the President who never lost sight of the fact that he was nothing more than a common man. Refreshing attitudes that we do not seem to see in politicians today. In his own words, on many subjects, and shooting from the hip his words provide a greater understanding to what Harry Truman was made of. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to know more about Harry Truman or anyone who has an interest in U.S. history."
5,An entertaining and insightful view of Truman,"This is a wonderful collection of quotes, letters, and anecdotes which together give the reader a quick view of Truman's life as well as a mental picture of the man from many different instances and viewpoints. This book, because of its clear depiction of Truman's character, makes the reader feel connected to Truman in a way that a biography perhaps does not."
4,A fairly detailed and comprehensive book,"A good read to get the key facts on the struggle between the conquistadores and the Indians. Hanke focuses mainly on the abuses of the conquistadores, the encomienda system and the long battle of Fray Bartolome de las Casas for Indian rights and freedoms. The book is very well organized, with Part II ""Spanish Experiments in America"", especially interesting. Overall, a worthy read for understanding the reasons behind the conquest and the problems that ensued."
3,WAS IT WORTH THE WAIT?,"We have been waiting for this album for nearly two years, after being teased with various white label singles.....And finally, well to be honest, this is a pretty good cd. For most it will be what you expected. A good blend of break beat and electronic soul. The problem is that you have heard most of these songs before(or you have heard various imitations), on different compilation albums. This project was supposed to be released, at the very least, a year and a half ago on Island Blue records. If this album would've dropped then, it certainly would've had a stronger impact. A couple of years is more than enough time for copy cats to saturate listeners with a similar sound, and that really is the only probelm I have with this release...it was done a little too late. Clearly it is still worth purchasing, but next time dont make us wait that long.."
4,Number Theory,Great book easy to follow if you think paradigicly great for review to those adept with mathematics and also useful for those still learning
3,Not my style,"I don't like how some theorems are proved with pictures and long paragraphs. There are more rigorous introductory texts out there. Also, the author doesn't explain some important steps in his picture proof. There was one question where the answer used modulo, but the author hasn't explained what it is yet."
5,Classic Number Theory Text,"This is one of the classic texts on Number Theory. It is a challenging book for anyone. The problem sets range from easy to hard. There are some hints, but those are few and far between. Like most Dover math books, it's dry and concise. There are better books on the market, but not for this price."
4,Very Pretty Bowls,"These bowls are a little larger than I expected, but are a wonderful addition to the plates I purchased along with them. Corelle backs their products 100%. They are great for soups as well."
4,Actually Pretty Good,"I disagreed with the other reviewer but hey, that's what makes America great: we can disagree. Is this the definitive movie about transgenderism? No, but there aren't many documentaries about the transgender experience, and I thought that this was a worthy addition to the small library, especially when you include the ""extra"" of Dr. Bowers addressing a medical group about genital transformative surgery. It teaches, it entertains, and it opens a window on a little-seen part of humanity. If the topic interests you, I would recommend checking this one out."
3,"OK, but not what I expected","I was a little disappointed with this video. It tells a bit about the history of transexual surgery carried out in Trinidad with the emphasis on events after Dr. Beiber retired. It has very little, however, about the history of trinidad or anything about some of the great historic buildings in town.In short, if you're interested in transsexualism, then this is your movie. If your interest is in Trinidad (Hey, it IS the title of the movie after all) then you, too, may be disappointed."
5,3 great books,"This is a collection of 3 early Sir John Appleby books: Hamlet, Revenge (one of my favorites), Death at the President's Lodging or Seven Suspects, and The Daffodil Affair. I was especially glad to see the last one, since I'd never read it."
3,Good enough,"1 minute wind-up generates 30 minutes of continuous ""Bright illumination"". it does illuminate after 20 or 30 minutes, but the point is can we use this illumination to see things around us? well, for 5 minutes the answer is yes.The device is handy and rugged.For those who are interested to know how it works:There is a mechanical gear to increase the speed of your manual rotation. the gear is connected to a dynamo. The outlet of the dynamo is rectified, regulated, stored in 3 small NiMH batteries.I like the idea and the construction of the device, but the white illumination is not as good as it is stated. Besides, nothing defeats traditional torches."
1,Not good for emergencies,"I bought one a few years ago, stuck in my glove box for emergencies.Transferring stuff to my new car the other day, I decided to test it.After cranking for a minute, it lasted a few seconds and it then it would not work no matter how much I cranked it. Evidently, from other reviews and what I now know about batteries, I should have periodically used/""exercised"" it and recharged to give internal battery a longer life.If that is the case, the directions did not give that advice.The package also states ""no batteries"" which is misleading since that is why I bought it for emergency only purpose thinking it would come in handy. Unfortunately, it seems these types of lights are not good to rely on for that purpose."
1,pass this one up,I cranked this flashlight up for ten minutes before first use as directed. The light stays bright for one minute and then becomes so dim that you can't see anything with it.
2,Disappointed product,"I bought two flashlights in early 2011 for the use of friends living in mountain without electricity. These two seemed to be excellent and recharged rapidly. But when I bought another two flashlights, same model, same color, in April, 2011 with ""Price Reduced"". Neither one recharge although I tried for swirling more than 5 minutes. Very disappointed!"
1,"Not bad, if it works at all","I ordered 5 of these flashlights. 3 of them worked pretty well. 2 of them only stayed lit for a second or two. Another reviewer had the same problem, so I know I am not alone. Ordering from this seller is a crap shoot."
1,Not worth full,"The flashlight is not working. It's bit larger size then other flashlights. It recommended to wind for 10 min before first use, I did exactly same and it gave me 2 seconds (not minutes) of light. May be I got defective product. There is no name on this flash light (may be it's too cheep one)."
3,Concise and Dense,"The book uses most of chapter 1 to explain techniques and concepts from Linear Algebra. Toward the end he makes the connection between vector space and functional space and has a common language developed. The Linear Algebra is not of a very high level and should have been covered in a good undergraduate course. The Function Space concepts should be familiar to anyone having taking ODE using Fourier Transforms. I am know working in Chapter 2 and the concise way he writes leaves out steps or doesn't make explicit connections and so I find myself re-reading and looking for other resources. I have not tried the exercises but they look to run from straight forward to ridiculous, which is probably what a graduate text should do. So if he had used a few more words and steps I would give 5 stars but alas, I cannot."
1,WORST BOOK EVER,The standard layout of the book is this:1. State some kind of general motivation for some handwaving.2. Begin handwaving inserting some modified equations for flavor.3. Handwave profusely and go through an extremely easy example.4. Have a problem set that gives the statements of problems that are more vague than the sections explaining how to solve them.This book is best used for a reference and better used as kindling.
4,"Excellent, but Overpriced, Reference on Bank Risk Management","This is an excellent book which I have found to be very useful. The book gets 5 stars for its content. The negative is that the book is overpriced, particularly when the publisher released a paperback version priced at less than half the price of the hardback version shortly after the hardback was published - hence the lower rating."
4,"Great intro, but a bit repeatitive","Bessis' volume is an elementary introduction to the basic ""concepts"" of risk management in banking. This is by no mean a technical book and should be accessible to most people with high school maths background. Judging on the capacity to explain basic ideas in layman's term, this is an excellent book!However, the author seems to be a bit repeatitive and some basic concepts are to be repeated a few times throughout the book. I find it annoying but others might well find it a desirable feature for a ""textbook"". On the other hand, although the book is full of diagrams and illustrations, a small number of them are quite puzzling, e.g. contain symbols which are nowhere defined and is probably up to the reader to guess!Anyway, if it is the first book you'll ever read on this subject, I believe it is an excellent choice!"
1,Completely different content,"I bought that book from Amazon, and i have checked the content as well as the number of pages on the posted book on the website. However, as the book came, i realized that the content and number of pages are completely different . There are 350 pages compared to 707 pages it was supposed to have and the content is just rubbish. I have claimed the sellers but they did not help to refund or exchange. So bad"
3,"Good, not great recording.","I do not know why RCA used this recording. There are many recordings of the 5th that are much better. In this one with Munch there are many mistakes. In the end of the fourth movement, there is a brass disaster. The overature is not great either. Schubert's 8th, though, is pretty good. I would recomend you look for another CD."
3,lacks option for standard shift transmission,"this product starts the car but lacks the safety feature of the clutch push in,be aware there is a difference between auto and standard shift trans switches."
4,Not bad,"I see reviews people who seemed to think they were buying something other than what was described. This isn't meant to be a totally sealed thermos, just a spill resistant cup. You're also not going to get a stainless lined cup for $10. For what I paid and expected this does the job nicely. The top doesn't totally seal around the hole but does so enough to prevent spilling while carrying. Interior is lined with odorless hard plastic. The screw top has not leaked on me yet and seems to seal fine. Love the 20 oz size too. Overall not a bad cup at all."
4,My favorite cup,"The bottom shape makes it a little unstable on grass or in some car cup holders, but the thermal insulation is excellent. I bought three so that I would't be digging for lids that match. Good value."
5,Love 99% of this Mug,"It is a roomy 24 fl Oz. It keeps the coffee warm for a pretty good amount of time. The handle is very secure and strong, which is important to me. The lid could use some work as far as leak protection, but I am careful, so it is not that big of an issue. Again, I love this mug as I searched for at least 14 hours for a large (20 oz +) before I found this one."
3,cheap construction,"travel mug broke within 2 weeks, cheap construction of handle is the cause. would not buy again"
1,Travel Mug,"This cofee mug is not useful product in spite of my expectation. The inside the mug is not stainless, thus it does NOT help coffee keep warm. I use other smaller Starbuck coffee mug instead."
2,Travel Mug,It arrived in good condition in a timely manner but the top does not stay on and allows it to leak. Not very good for travel.
1,Wrong Edition,"I've received the incorrect edition (1985), but I bought the 1999 edition. The seller (Delerosa) doesn't answers my messages. I dont't have the address for return the book. I hate e-comm!"
4,Hart to Hart returns,"Loved this return of our favourite detective couple! The chemistry between to 2 main charactures is as HOT as it was in the original series, and once you get used to the few grey hairs and wrinkles it like they never left our screens. Great Sunday afternoon chill out movie :o)"
5,Fantastic!,"The Harts always showed you the best side of people. That's what made the show such a hit. Love, kindness, togetherness, faith in each other and tenacity! They have it all in each show. Especially this one! What happened to them only made them stronger; if that's possible."
4,"I liked it, but not biblical","I only watched the first episode on the 4 disc--Mary Magdalene. I know that I am re-studying the bible and as I was watching thie movie, it made logical sense why Mary slept with many men...when Jesus initially was there when she was about to be stoned for her adultery and later at the well, said you are married to 5 husbands (meaning intimate contact with men)...but this movie did not illustrate or show that and surprisingly showed her with the anointed oil, kissing his feet and washing it with her tears and wiping it with her hair...thought this was another woman with no name in the Bible...however it was well-written and brought tears to my eyes since women are mistreated and sometimes viewed as a prize or piece of meat as they explained in the movie (a man's possession and not to ever love them)....I enjoyed the acting (astounding and superb) and want to buy it and watch the other versions from the Public Library!"
4,This movie so candidly analyzes the key relationships in Jesus' life!! A must see.,I was impressed with the honest portrayal of Jesus' closest confidantes and followers. I felt that I could truly relate to each of them. I loved Him more after watching this!
3,"Good, not great","While the actors were professional and the man who played Jesus was good, I'd recommend ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""Visual Bible: Matthew"" over this product any day."
4,good toy for boys,"this was a big hit with my boys, the zap catches you off guard but they still like it. I hope they prove to be durable."
4,Shockingly fun,"This is a game for older kids. My 7 year old tried it and got mad whenever he got shocked. But my almost 9 year old and his friend,10, love it. So does my husband. I've tried it too; the shocks hurt, but it does add an element of risk with the game! Seems to be good quality."
1,complete disappointment,"I bought this for my brother-n-law for x-mas last year. And we were so excited to open it up and play, but no matter what we did, we couldn't get it to work at all! Complete disappointment for the family games!"
4,Hours of fun!!!!!,"This product was great, picked up a bunch of them, and ran around with my buddies for hours playing like a kid again."
2,Need strong hands,"You need stronger hands than I have to use them. Maybe larger hands would help, too. I can get it open a tiny bit one-handed, but then I can't cut straight without ripping the fabric because i can't open it futher. I'll have to send them back and I guess spend the extra 5 or more to get the ones with shorter blades - these are 8+ inches; even tthe 7+ might be too big for me, but have not tried those yet."
4,Brilliantly light.,"For the price this is a great pair of pinking shears. It has good teethes that really grip into the material, even with silk chameuse. Although with light and slippery materrial it is not easy to navigate the cut and will require some patience! Otherwise, super happy working with this pair of scissors. In hind sight I am glad I bought this lighter pair as a heavier pair would really make it hard to use on slippery and light fabrics."
3,Does the job,"I got this product super fast. I do a lot of crafting and thought that by using pinking shears I would add a decorative touch to my banners. They are ok but I thought the pinking would be larger or more pronounced. You can harldy see the detail on my banners. Oh, well back to adding ric rac.They are pretty sharp though. But I wish I would have saved my money."
3,"Cuts well, but hard on hand.","These cut the fabric with ease and does it's job well. However, opening it is a little stiff. After cutting a bunch of half yards of fabric, my middle finger, which bore the brunt of the lifting action, is still swollen a day after and there is a tiny sore on it. I'm only 28 and my hands don't have and arthritic problems or anything. These scissors would be good for projects that require some trimming here and there, but not for projects that require a lots of it. I guess I should have bought a rotary style cutter instead."
1,Very stiff,I agree with other posts about the difficulty in using these pinking shears. They worked for about 1/2 hour and then became so stiff that I needed two hands to close them. I returned them. I don't know if it was a bad batch or inherent design flaw. It's worth investing in a better brand and something that is entirely metal (in my opinion).
2,disappointed,"Usually a great product but these are very hard to use and after cutting for a while, they freeze up and can't be opened. Tried spraying CRC and that worked for a short itme. I use these for cutting small circles of fabric to top jelly jars and cut many yards at a time. It seems they are defective."
4,Wrong country of origin,"UPDATE! Since I complained, Amazon has removed the Made in the USA statements. There were two of them.These shears look nice, but they aren't made in the US. I just received them and the package says made in China. I would've kept looking if they hadn't misrepresented them."
5,"It's not the tightest production, but I love this DVD.","Rather than providing anything new, I'll just comment on the 2 previous reviews: I agree with the all the points made about the show being loose and unruly. This is not a slick release, and suffers the translation from stage to DVD. That said, I loved it. I loved that they were screwing around, with each other, the script, and the audience. It's like everyting Boosh, the first viewing is never the best viewing. That's why we buy this stuff. We'll ignore the stupid parts (there are always a few), and focus on the genius. This proformance isn't bad, it's just a bit laissez-faire. ...still gets 5-stars from me, on account of, I watch it a lot."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of the show and I didn't like this that much. Some of the skits are good, but it is very slow. No new songs. I felt embarassed for them. It was painful to watch. It's like they were looking for a way to write-off a trip that they hadn't prepared material for. Hopefully this review will lower your expectations so that you can enjoy it more."
5,Superb Snapshots of People and Places,"Anyone who is looking at this page probably wants to buy the book anyway, but I really cannot recommend this volume highly enough. It was written before JL-M became veddy, veddy grand, with all the charm, passion, wit, and insight as his later work. The reach and range of the L-M diaries is such that one literally grows up and older with him. Start with this one and then buy all the rest. Wonderful picture of the WWII years, not only its drama and privation, but the quirky people JL-M into whose houses and hearts he wormed his way into."
5,Unbelievable,"This is one of the major recordings that inspires me to play. He does things with his guitar on this cd that I had never dreamed possible. I completely freaked out the first time I listened to this album. A real shame that this is not in print. For me, the first track: Choros No. 1 is just overwhelming and over the top (just the way I like it). This is, in my opinion, one of the most important classical guitar recordings of all time."
4,its okay..................,I think DBZ RULES! with a capital R! I asked my mum for me to buy it and she said if I had enough money and I do and im gonna buy IT someday. I think that NAPA is COOOOOL!And VEEJETA HE's cool too! ITS about this guy named GOKU. HE LOOKES LIKE a girl but I was mistaken. He doesn't want to join back with the sayains so he fights them.(geewiz I'd just join with them save the hard work of blood and guts and stains on your pants DONT YOU HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS!)
5,BEAUTIFUL!,Great price and well-made! These are not small earrings and will be noticed by others! Light-weight and fun to wear.
2,Product is not as pictured,"I ordered the cherry blades and the boxes I recieved said ""cherry"" but he product is not like what is pictured. The grain is very straight and the color is much darker than the picture. Not what I wanted."
2,Basics are not enough--give us some factual tips,"The first 21 pages of the book are filler, and add no value on housebreaking your dog. The book does not follow the course of housebreaking your dog to go outdoor. Instead, the book uses a ""break your dog on paper in the house"" before taking that accomplishment outside. Trust me, you are better off to do it right (outside) first. The book fudges on its step-by-step program by acknowledging that all dogs are different, hence no one program fits all. What about average length of time a 9 week can hold his/her bladder during the night? These and many other tips are absent. The book is very basic."
5,Love the diet plan! Fast and easy calorie counter!,"Fast and easy calorie counter. Extensive database on the internet for those of us watching carbohydrates, (carbs), protien, fat, and fiber. I love the diet,exercise, fitness plan. It is so easy, I am sure I attain my perfect weight using this plan with very little effort, and I am well on my way! It is also not an expensive diet plan with lot's of prepackaged food at outrageous prices. You can eat the foods you love, and make a few minor modifications. Buy this book if you want to get slim forever!"
3,Still counting...,"An ok book for counting calories, but a bit disappointing to find out that the ""Free access to an internet database that lists complete food nutrient gram counts for carbs, protein, fat, biger, and much more!"" is the Department of Agriculture site, www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/HG72/hg72.html Suggest you do a bit more research on the internet before you buy the book. I feel a bit as if I bought a ticket to the egress...Not necessary to carry the book with you everywhere either since the food you eat tends to repeat itself. Just make a quick list and look it up later. Otherwise the fast food data is useful but also available for many places if you check their internet sites. Not an expensive volume, but not an absolutely necessary one either."
2,Not bad but could be better,"This video starts out talking about picking veils and canes for dancing. This was very informative. The tutorial part that comes next before the actually work out is very fast and while the moves are explained again you go from one step to another very quickly. It goes from plain step tutorial, to veil tutorial to cane tutorial before the actually work outs start. I think it would work better if the step tutorial was right before each section of work out it correlated too."
5,Best of Hou.,"For me, this is the best application of Hou's rigorous formality. His long-take style and the manner in which three generations of Taiwan are woven through one character are breathtaking. It's amazing to watch the shots echo and reflect each other, while the lives of the characters do the same. (My favorite: a shot in the bedroom, using a mirror. The scene builds to sex between the two leads. Later, a discussion in the same room, shot the same way, with a conversation concerning parenthood and abortion.) This is certainly not for all tastes, but is unquestionably a masterpiece."
3,Very complex with overlapping ideas,"I am currently using the book for a managerial economics class and find the information confusing . Certainly a review of supply and demand (chapter 3) and its application of middle level managers is crucial and should have been placed before optimizing techniques (chapter 2). The assumption is the student or reader has just finished an introduction economics course and all the information is still fresh in the mind. Personally, I review all principles in this book with basic economic principles for a much clearer understanding of the topics."
4,An interesting presentation ?,"Having seen three different ring cycles this fourth one came as an interesting diversion. It's with a smaller orchestra than normal so it's not 'big' Wagner. And it's presented on a smaller stage so it's much more intimate. While this 'intimacy' is not very Wagnerian it does seem to get one closer to the script in execution if not in design, at least for me. Strangely the subtitle translation seems to diverge from the norm which also adds a little interest. One specific complaint is for Das Reingold where there's no transformations during the transformation music. Oh well. And this is not a consistant 'back-to-back' production so doesn't meet Wagner's vision for the full scope of the Ring. But this should not be ones first Ring cycle DVD set anyway - either the Bayreuth or Met cycles are much more satisfying. But damn, it's nice to have the choice !"
1,Smells like pickle juice and cleaning products,"HORRIBLE SCENT!!!! Overall it's just a disgusting product. The description on the back label is lying. False advertising!! The spray starts to flake after a few hours and leaves your hair looking like a mess. After the first application, I started coughing for like five minutes. Worst hair product I ever bought. The product contains alcohol and is flammable."
2,Dissapointing ....,It was well recommended to me but I found it quite boring and found myself fast forwarding through the chapters. It has an interesting theme - the cause of natural catastrophes - but for a science book I found it quite dissapoiting...
4,excellent read,"May be overly simplistic for some but the role of power laws in nature and seemingly in human history is fascinating, and quite timely given small issues recently. Will a small economic issue lead to major crash? Very worthwhile read."
5,the power of simple toy models,"I think the book is really great at discusing the practical ramifactions of the simple toy models of sand castles ala Per Bak. The book doesn't go into nearly enough detail about the mathematics of the models. At its heart the book, takes the sand-castle pile,as a model of earthquakes, and equally simple epedimic models and forest fire models and applies them metamorphorically to the history of scientific revolutions ala Kuhn, stock prices, war and revolution. Perhaps the scale invariance in the size of paradigmn shifts, helps explain why many though Kuhn was inconsistent in his use of the word paradigm.There isn't alot of detail in the history section but still the book would make great airplane reading and is well worth while. I hope someday someone(or did Wolfram try that?) will come out with a systematic can concise catalog of these toy models that push the behavior of stystems to that 'complex boundary of chaotic behavior..."
3,A granular view of sandpile theory,"I, like some of the other reviewers, found that I could not read this cover to cover. And, I thirst for topics that look at the not-so-obvious faults and currents which underlie everything. Thus, I was eager to read about work being done with sandpile theories. Yes, there was mention of it. And, there were callbacks to it. But, whatever whole and complete picture Buchanan was trying to paint never came together. There were so many side trips and diversions that I just had to skim whole chapters in search of where I might pick up the trail again. I felt I was left in the woods, deep with discussion of the science itself rather than the topic this science was supposed to be exploring. Some of the stories were interesting. And, for me, there was a take away: the notion of maladjustment -- the build up of stress preceding any ...upheaval. In this case, the book might have a case of mal-editing."
3,Good but a little annoying,"It teaches you over 200 new words that you can listen and learn. The dialog in the tape can be very annoying. I wish that the tape contains more word and less useless dialog. If you take out all the annoying dialogs in the tape, it will make 5-stars tape :)If you want to learn as much new words as you can in a short period of time, try Verbal Advantage (ISBN 1559276193)."
4,Word Smart,Product is very user friendly. The two mentors make the experience fun and entertaining. Chock full of very useful words and verbage. A small price to pay for very empowering language. I will try to find Volume one to complete what I think is a very enriching tool.
4,It is fun,"I was a bit disappointed at first - I listened to the other CD set before this one But, more I listened to it , more interesting it became. Both voices are very seductive and full of subtle energy. I am not sure if the ""guest speaker"" are different or same guys, if they are same I have to admit they did a profound job. I loved the different accent and content of the story as well. I would really remember the words s well as the sentences from the speakers note.Definitely highly recommended!"
3,"There's two classic, most of the others are dumb","The cartoons include:PETE HOTHEAD **Though Pete has a funny voice, this cartoon is quite boring.POPCORN STORY ***Pretty good, but awfully forgettable.CHRISTOPHER CRUMPET *****This is one of the greatest UPA cartoons ever made (in the top five).UNICORN IN THE GARDEN *****This cartoon is even better! Based off James Thurber's wonderful fable about a unicorn, a husband and an evil wife.BALLET OOP *Bleechhh!FOUR WHEELS, NO BRAKES *This Pete Hothead cartoon is even worse than the earlier one.THE RISE OF DUNTON LANG *Boring. Forgettable. Stupid.FAMILY CIRCUS *Do not think this has anything to do with the comic strip ""The Family Circus"" because it is not. You might has well have turned the tape off after 'The Unicorn in the Garden' was over, anyway.So, if you already have already seen Christopher Crumpet and The Unicorn in the Garden, don't expect any other classics.* = Terrible** = Pretty bad*** = Average**** = Good***** = Great"
3,A solid and well-written naval history.,"The naval actions around the Solomon Islands were a series of hard-fought actions between two well-matched opponents. The Japanese ability to fight aggressively at night challenged the U.S. Navy. Eventually, increased tactical ability joined with an advantage in radar allowed the Americans to defeat the Japanese, but as Crenshaw shows, it was not easy. The pleasant surprise in this book is the emphasis the author (a former gunnery officer on the USS MAURY) puts on the effectiveness and use of weapons and fire control systems. His narrative flows, and shows the reader the many tasks destroyers were called upon to do. I don't get a real personal feel for Mr. Crenshaw, to me the biggest drawback of an otherwise-admirable work. Good set of maps! Recommended to those appreciating naval history, the Pacific Campaigns in WW2, and destroyers."
4,"Great look, could be softer","The entire collection is beautiful; note that the cross-stitched items such as the duvet cover and some of the pillowcases are dry clean only due to the embroidery although the collection is 100% cotton.I found these sheets and pillowcases to be a little on the stiff side (maybe that means they're more durable). Perhaps when they've been washed a few more times they'll feel softer; however, it didn't take that long to get used to them."
4,"Great show, Poor Quality DVD","I was delighted to find Asterix and Cleopatra on DVD. My brothers and I came across half of it on the Disney channel years and years ago, and it is one of our favorite childhood memories. Out of all the Asterix movies, this is our favorite! It has the best songs, and Obelix finally gets to have some magic potion!However, the sound quality is very poor on this disc--you have to turn up the tv really loud to hear it! However, at the moment it is the only way to watch Asterix and Cleopatra. If it ever gets re-released in a higher quality edition, I will definitely buy it again."
1,Not what you are looking for...,"The audio is terrible, none of it is in French, the drawings are pedestrian and racist. I would not recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the Asterix stories."
4,Outstanding Insight,"A very useful read. Mr. Lereah provides excellent insights about real estate investing, whether it's labeled ""buyer"" or ""seller"" market. In very readable style, he outlines the factors we all should look into, when buying our own home or considering other real estate investment. Former US House Speaker Tip O'Neill was right on the money about politics being local...and David Lereah is on the money (for all of us) about the LOCAL factors affecting real estate."
2,Kindle version lacking,"I've purchased and been happy with many Kindle books, but this version is a poor OCR replica of the original. Could the publisher had run this through a spell checker? And of course Greek letters aren't rendered at all. Disappointed."
4,"Excellent resource in content, hard to use in Kindle form","I have used this resource for years, and it is highly recommended as a book. In Kindle form it does not have a useful table of contents at this time (12/2012), and therefore it is hard to search by subject. Will there be an update? It is needed. I would give 5 stars for content, and 3 for Kindle form."
2,No hypertext links in Kindle version!,"I would give the dictionary itself 5 stars for its excellent scholarship, but the Kindle version has been seriously crippled by not making the entries clickable in the Subject Index and the Articles Index. Why in the world didn't they do this? Instead, you have to see if the article exists in the dictionary and then start randomly clicking in the progress bar until you find the article that you want. I can't believe I paid over $30 for the Kindle version and they didn't even provide this simple functionality for the reader! I had to hunt through dozens of pages until I finally found the entry on the Gospel of Luke. Please update this!!(I left the same complaint for The Dictionary of Paul and His Letters.)"
4,!,"Book arrived in stated condition and prior to est. arrival date. Excellent source for understanding some concepts, could be more in depth."
2,"Great recipes, inaccurate index","The recipes are great, but impossible to find unless you are thumbing through the book. Oxmoor is still publishing the book to reflect the monthly magazines, not food categories.I still have yet to find where the edame recipe is."
2,Disappointing,"I'm not sure I would toss this into the idea of ""light"" cooking. More oil than I would use in many of the recipes. The variety is good, but the simplicity of the recipes varies and, frankly, much of it I would never wish to make. I have found a better use for the ""Weight Watchers New Day 365 menu book"", since it provided lighter fare."
5,Great everyday cookbook!,"I ordered the 2006 and 2007 edition from Amazon after using the 2008 and 2009 for two weeks. Every week, I go through all four books and pick new recipes to try. I make the ingredient list and I go grocery shopping during the weekend. With this weekly format, I have thrown away less food and saved more money. My boyfriend and I loved every meal so far! I love the format of the book. It has allowed me to go through the book and pick recipes at random, which makes dinner time an adventurous experience. These books have given me a renewed passion in cooking at home."
5,Rich and rewarding,I highly recommend this book. An anthology of articles by historians critiqueing historical novels. The reviews are uniformly excellent and many of the author's responses are truly inspired. Great source of suggested reading for lovers of historical fiction.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I had bought this piece, it looked good on the web and listed some good features. It DOES NOT work at all. When I called people, they could NOT hear me at all. The music that gets turned on when you put someone on hold was not playing inside the phone itself but rather it was some sort of a CHEAP radia playing outside, so the person waiting on the other end of the phone wont hear it but you would hear it. This phone looks so very cheap and tacky. It broke within a week. The seller is also NOT friendly at all. At the end I ended up losing my money and breaking this piece of cheap tacky so called phone and throwing in trash. Dont go by the way is looks on the page, it looks VERY VERY taqky in real. Hope I helped you. Thanks!"
1,not the real thing,"I read the previous review but ordered this anyway. It is indeed not the real thing. The packaging and shampoo are not the same as the bottle I previously bought at a salon. The shampoo is diluted and bubbly - like when you mix water with the end of a soap bottle to extend your supply. The packaging has slightly different wording on the front, and the languages on the back are Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, and Swedish (instead of the standard English, French, and Spanish.)I am fine with buying knock-offs of certain things I like when I go to the dollar store - but not when I'm paying almost $30 for fancy shampoo!"
2,Just a list,"If your looking for a list of all the different martial strikes, then this is a good book for you. For example, if you don't know what a straight (jab) punch or a reverse (cross) is then I guess you can learn it and many other techniques.However, if you'd like to learn HOW to strike hard/fast/better than don't bother. Nothing on heavy bag punching. Nothing on strengthening/conditioning your body to allow it to strike more efficiently... just a list of strikes!Having lived in Korea for over 3 years I can safely say that it's a very Korean thing to do. Make a long list of all the different things your capable of. In the end, one is left with the question ""so what""?"
1,All stuck together!,"I received my case (12 bags) and every bag was as solid as a rock. I opened 2 bags immediately and some of the beans did separate but most did not. I now have sticky feeling beans in with jelly bean clumps. They do taste okay (not great) and certainly not at all what I had hoped after reading two glowing reviews. Next time I'm going for the lifesaver jelly beans, maybe I'll have better luck!"
2,The story of a 15 year old girl in High School,"Both Sides Now by Ruth Pennebaker, is the story of a 15 years old girl named Liza who is a sophomore in high school. This book states all the problem's she's encountering in her personal life, all the way from her mom fighting breast cancer to how much she despises the cafeteria food. She expresses a lot of her internal thoughts which gives us a great over view of her personality. In some cases this book was so surprising i had to go read over, because I couldn't believe what I was reading. I think this book was writen for a teen age girl, because it seems like this book could relate a lot to the problems that a teen age girl would encounter. I don't think a guy could find much intrest in ths book, so I would recomend this book to any girl who is intrested in a good story."
5,I find myself in agreement with all of her points...,Pat Fennell has succinctly addressed the problems faced by people with chronic illnesses and their providers...The [Four] Phase Model ties it all together! I will recommend it to colleagues and friends. A great tool in our treatment toolkit and an excellent aid to any patient who has a chronic illness.
2,Not beautifull,I saw that shoes on one classmate and I didn't like how they look. They doesnt look stylish.
1,not happy,These shoes are suposed to be PEEP TOEmeaning you can see your toes when you wear them.You can not see them so what is the sense of even having a cut out there????I was NOT happy at all.I am also not happy that I did not get a refund instead a gift certificate!why????
1,Book is schizophrenic,"I have a number of problems with this book. First, it doesn't cover 7.0 in any depth. 7.0 is shut away in an appendix in the back of the book. The rest of the book focuses on mostly 4.2 code, with some 6.5 coverage. So, right off the bat, it's out of date. Second, there's little continuity in this work. It's all over the place topic-wise. It's like the authors dug up all the neato code they'd written over the years and wrote a book about it, with no thought to actually covering the subject at hand systematically or logically. Lastly, the book is uneven. I suppose this is due to multiple authors, but it's just a guess. Whatever the case, the book jumps from being overly formal to converational on a regular basis. It's like the book is a bit schizophrenic."
1,Obsolete,"I think this book should cover version 7.0 in depth, but it doesn't. It's like all the code was written before 7.0. Giving me old-type joins and queries that no longer work is no way to make me a fan of your work. Also, many of the topics covered are essoteric to a fault. Who cares about calling bcp.exe from Transact-SQL (especially when we have the BULK INSERT command in 7.0 now) ? I was really disappointed with this one. I don't think it's on par with the other O'Reilly titles."
2,"Uses old techniques, doesn't cover 7.0","This book needs an update. It uses old techniques like system table queries and *= joins which have been discouraged by Microsoft. Also, the continuity could be much better. Sometimes it feels like three or four separate books rather than one. I give it 2 stars for being so out of date."
1,Completely out-of-date,"The big problem with this book is that it's quite dated. I'm still trying to understand why anyone would publish a book in 1999 that targeted SQL Server 6.5 or, worse yet, 4.2. Version 7.0 had been out for some time, when this book came out, so the fact that they would target old versions mystifies me."
1,Not up to the quality of the other Nutshell books,"I bought this book because I needed to brush up on my T-SQL for SQL Server 7.0 and have always had good luck with the Nutshell books. I was really bummed when I began working through this book. It's targeted exclusively at 4.2 and 6.5, despite the claim on the cover that its a 7.0 book. Version 7.0 is relegated to an appendix and even that coverage isn't very good and contains numerous errors. Basically, I was really let down by this book. I'm planning to return it later this week."
1,Disjointed and out of date,"My first problem with this book is that it misleads you into believing its a 7.0 book when in fact it's not even specifically an MS SQL book -- it also covers Sybase. None of the example code is for version 7.0 of MS SQL. Some of it won't even work on 7.0. My second problem is that many of the examples fail to tell you whether they're for Microsoft or Sybase. You end up trying code on Microsoft that will never work because it uses Sybase-specific syntax. My last problem is that the book is disjointed. I don't know if its the multiple authors or what, but the topics are all over the place. One minute they're at 30,000 feet, the next minute they're strafing the football field. One minute they're on stuff that's really only meaningful to a DBA, the next minute they're trying to be coder-specific."
4,Most of what you need,"As a Sybase user/programmer, I find this book to be very helpful. The one thing I find upsetting about the book is that it doesn't always make a clear distinction about whether something is for Sybase or for Microsoft. Considering the publication date of 1999, all of the people who complain that this is out-of-date are forgetting that when you write a technical book, you have to freeze things at a certain point so you can write your book. For the time they froze it (would have to have been about mid-1998), it covers nearly anything you could need regarding Sybase... which is what I needed."
1,Needs update,"Book is lack in coverage of 7.0. Only one chapter on it, while the rest of book emphasises older versions. Where is SELECT TOP? Where are meta functions? Many things change with new release -- book should show that."
1,Needs about a pound of wrinkle cream,"I bought this O'Reilly title because I've had good luck with O'Reilly titles before. The Nutshell series is particularly good. This one, however, is a real disappointment. First, it's focused entirely on old versions of SQL Server. Version 7.0 has been out long enough that this is inexcusable. Second, it recommends poor techniques. A book like this should *only* recommend ANSI outer joins -- old-style outer joins can return incorrect results. Third, the book is deceiving. The cover says it covers version 7.0, but 7.0 has been relegated to an appendix and the coverage there isn't very good. If you need an up-to-date, comprehensive t-sql reference, don't get this book."
1,Out of date,"After all the ballyhoo on this book, I went and bought it. Frankly, I'm disappointed. Were there pages missing or did old Kevin forget about T-SQL error handling? With SQL Server 2000 on the street much of what you see here is old hat. Current books cover SQL 2000. This one doesn't. For a guy that apparently spends more times in newsgroups than he does with the product, the self-important style is inappropriate. Go and earn your stripes, Kevin."
1,Not a scintila of coverage on SQL 2000,"If you are wanting a modern TSQL book, this is not the one to get. There's no coverage whatever of SQL 2000. Instead, get Ken Henderson's The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL. It's much more modern and it's examples actually work on 2000 - unlike many in this book."
2,Best of a bad bunch,"For some reason, books on TSQl are uniformly bad, and are frequently rehashes of how to use the GUI. This isn't. Apart from some howlers, it is not a bad book, and if you're migrating from Sybase to MSSQL is a must. However, the Acknowledgement section makes the book worth buying all by itself. It is the most cringing piece of arslicking I have seen in my life."
4,A Well Done Book That Is Starting To Show It's Age,"I bought this book to get more out of my SQL Server code, and to have a printed reference for stored procedures and triggers. The information in the book is very thorough and complete, though it is a bit out of date (an example would be I critiqued a programmer for declaring varchar (4000) because SQL Server only allowed 255 characters in 6.5. He was correct because we use 7.0..). However, this book also explains the underlying fundamentals of SQL Server and how it operates, how it physically stores the data, provides optimization hints, tricks, and tips that have made a marked improvement in my code. This book is perfect for the intermediate developer who is looking to move on in their skills. Combined with SQL In A Nutshell, also from O'Reilly which just came out, I can find almost everything I need to know about SQL Server."
2,Completely lacking in current techniques and examples,"This book ought to cover SQL 7.0 in some detail, especially with SQL 2000 about to come out. It doesn't. I was really disappointed with the old-style joins (a big no-no) and the queries against system tables that no longer exist. Also, the prose itself is pretty weak. It's boring and reads like a text book."
5,Use it for the REAL work!,"Chapter 19, the chapter on tuning, is worth the price of this book alone! Although some of the code on the accompanying CD is written for 6.5, the code in the book is written for 7.0 - and works, according to my experience. If you are a REAL DBA and are looking for some good information regarding 6.5 OR 7.0 (or Sybase), this book is the one you want."
2,Missing several key elements; focuses on old versions,"I have no doubt that the authors know Transact-SQL very well. The problem is, they inexplicably focus on old versions of it in this book. SQL 7 is practically omitted from this book entirely. There's no coverage of fulltext searching. No coverage of SELECT TOP or the statistical aggregate functions. No coverage of automation, the BULK INSERT command, or the many other commands that were new or that changed significantly in version 7.0. This is simply inexcusable, and I recommend you skip this book because of it."
1,"Poorly organized, incongruous samples","I didn't like this book for a number of reasons. I guess, overall, I'd have to say I didn't feel it lived up to the fact that it's a Nutshell book.The first problem is that it jumps from topic to topic with scarcely a reason. The organization of this book is very difficult to follow.Also, the code samples are obviously targeted at releases of SQL prior to 7.0. Old-style outer joins are used throughout the book -- a real no-no these days.Worse yet, the book isn't written very well. The prose is as uneven as it is obtuse. I think this may be due to the fact that multiple people actually wrote it -- after all, people have different writing styles.I can't recommend this book. If you're looking for the ultimate guide to Microsoft Transact-SQL, don't get this book."
1,"A decent book, but really lacking in 7.0 coverage","I liked this book okay, but felt it was a bit dated. I kept running into techniques that I've heard Microsoft has recommended against, like directly querying the system tables or using *= joins. Also, the book seemed uneven -- I guess that's probably due to the multiple authors, but I dunno. I bought Henderson's Transact-SQL Guru's Guide book at the same time and I'm far happier with it. It's better in almost every category and covers 7.0 extensively."
1,Really disappointing,"I came to this book expecting SQL Server 7.0 coverage and was really disappointed. There's nothing about 7.0 in this book except for very perfunctory coverage in an appendix. Also, the book is disorganized and contains many coding errors and poor techniques. Guys, Microsoft deprecated old-style joins two releases ago.If you're looking for a comprehensive, up-to-date treatment of Transact-SQL, keep looking."
4,A better book than I thought.,"This is definitely NOT the book to read cover to cover. However, there is some valuable information to be gotten from this book. For instance Chapter 15. Stored Procedures was very valuable to me, Ch. 8 helped me prepare for a data migration, and I could go on and on about how specific chapters helped me get a clue about a given topic. I will admit though, a lot of this book could be considered a cure for insomnia, but if you want specific information about certain aspects of Transact-SQL, then this is a great reference tool, just don't buy it if you are not really familiar with Transact-SQL."
1,Code is very specific to 6.5 and 4.2,"I couldn't get many of the example routines in this book to work on MSSQL 7 or the MSSQL 2000 beta. It is really disappointing. I wrote the authors, but got no response. I know some of the problems are because the code targets old versions of the server. To me, this is not right because 7 has been released for along time now."
1,No SQL 7 coverage to speak of,"In obvious contradiction to its own cover, this book does not cover version 7.0 in any detail. That really disappointed me, especially given that many of the examples don't work on 7.0. Also, the book reads like a text book. It's dry to a fault."
5,Very good book for programming in T-SQL,"This is the best book that I have seen that explains procedural T-SQL. This is for anyone trying to understand and create store procedures (including extended store procs), views, triggers, error handling, functions, (good work done on the case statement) and, tuning and optimization of the code. There are also very good examples. In addition, there is a very good section for bcp with and without format files.Very well done. I highly recommend it to any programmer that works with Sybase or MS SQL. Although other reviews complain that this is outdated THIS IS ABSOLUTLY NOT TRUE - the way you use a select, update,delete and functions never change."
2,Disjointed and rife with errors/obsoletes,"This book is outdated. Many of the examples only work on version 6.5. The book is seems fairly comprehensive, but targets an old version of the server. Much of the sample code seems to be even older -- I suspect much of it was developed for 4.2. Also, the syntactical differences between Sybase and Microsoft Transact-SQL are often blurred. The book should have focused on only one of them -- they are enough different to warrant this."
2,Disappointed -- many examples don't work on 7.0,"Despite the cover, this is not a 7.0 book. I believe it was written for 4.2 or 6.5 because many of the source listings use techniques that have been deprecated for years, even by Microsoft (e.g., old-style joins). This thing really needs an update. I found no less than 10 examples that wouldn't work on 7.0."
4,Still A Good Reference,"Compared to the other T-SQL books on the market, this book makes a good reference for programmers concerned with writing compliant SQL for Microsoft and Sybase databases. Everytime I go to use this book, another developer seems to be borrowing it. That statement alone proves to me that this book is worthy of being in any technical library. Although the book is bit outdated (only goes up to Sybase 11.5), it does have a number of good examples. The book does a nice job of telling you what T-SQL statements apply to MS-SQL and Sybase-SQL. My only critique: Mr. Kline should have expanded the section on error handling."
2,"Good, but very specific to 6.5","I liked this book, but SQL 7.0 is covered in an appendix. Moreover, many of the techniques shown are archaic and have been deprecated by Microsoft, even for SQL 6.5. For example, joins are often show using the old join syntax. I wouldn't have such a problem with this if this book didn't advertise itself as a SQL 7.0 book. It's definitely not a 7.0 book and if you buy it expecting that, you'll be disappointed. Another problem with the book is its failure to adequately distinguish between Sybase and Microsoft syntax. There are some important differences, as the products have diverged more with each new release. Some of the examples show code that works on Sybase, but not on Microsoft (or vice versa), without telling the reader. The book would have been better off focusing on one or the other."
2,"Decent book, but way out of date","I remember SQL Server 4.2 and 6.5 well enough to know that this was a good book in its time. Problem is, 7.0 has been out for over a year and SQL 2000 is on the horizon. This book is woefully out of date. It queries system tables (in the first place, you shouldn't do that unless absolutely necessary) that don't even exist anymore (e.g., sysprocedures). It uses old-style joins throughout, despite the fact that they've been deprecated by Microsoft, Soukup&Delaney, Henderson, and many others. Last but not least, it *claims* 7.0 coverage, but does not deliver. A perfunctory appendix on 7.0 does not constitute SQL Server 7.0 coverage."
2,Sadly out of date,"Would extensive 7.0 coverage be too much too ask? I don't think so, and I don't think you will either. If you're like me, you'd come to this book expecting full coverage of the latest version of the language. Unfortunately, you won't get it -- it's not to be found between these covers. There's way too much time spent on the essoteric, and not nearly enough spent on the current version of the technology. First, they shouldn't be using old-style joins, particularly outer joins, because these can yield incorrect results. Second, they shouldn't be querying system tables directly when INFORMATION_SCHEMA views or system stored procedures will return the same info. Third, they shouldn't be delving into things like runnin bcp.exe from Transact-SQL in order to import data into the server - what a Rube Goldberg idea, especially when we have the BULK INSERT command built right into the language. Wouldn't waste my money on this if I were you."
1,Sloppily thrown together and out-dated,"I didn't like this book. I was looking for the be-all, end-all tome on T-SQL and was sorely disappointed. There's no consistently in syntax (e.g., old vs. new join syntax), nor in coding techniques. These guy may know T-SQL, but they don't seem to be seasoned coders."
5,Good book with easy-to-find answers to your questions,"Judging from the other reviews here, people either love this book or they hate it. I love it. This book has proved invaluable to me over the years, and I still reference it on occassion. Whenever I have a question about something, the answer is easy to find. It *is* out of date, as other reviewers have noted, but the majority of information contained within is still valid.If you're new to T-SQL, I recommend starting with this book."
2,Terribly out-dated,"The problem with this book is that it only covers version 6.5 and earlier in any detail. Sorry, the cover out to mention that. A single appendix does not constitute SQL 7 coverage. Worse yet, many of the techniques you take to solving complex query problems changed dramatically from 6.5 to 7.0, so a number of the solutions offered in the book either don't work at all or work very poorly. Giving when it was published, there's no excuse for this book not covering 7.0 and its way of doing things in detail. For the would-be SQL 7 transact-sql practitioner, this book is very near useless."
5,Great T-SQl reference when working on older systems,I use this for reference while working on Sybase 11.9.2. It's an excellent in-depth book. Includes basic SQL through procs and cursors to detailed tuning information. Only the index could use some improvement.
1,"If you want an obsolete, poorly written book, buy this","I was really disappointed in this book. For one thing, there's next to no SS 7.0 coverage. For another, what 7.0 coverage there is stuck away in an appendix. Who's idea was this? Another problem is that several of the queries don't work or they use old-style techniques that are now discouraged by MS. I plan to return this one to get my money back. What a waste of time."
1,Does not cover recent versions of the product,"If you want a book that focuses on Transact-SQL as it existed in Sybase/MS SQL Server 4.2, get this book. Otherwise, skip it. The techniques shown herein are obsolete and arcane. Many of the example queries no longer work on SQL Server 7.0 or 2000. Also, many of the coding practices are ill-advised. Save your money and get a more up-to-date book."
5,Beautiful Voice,Bought this CD for my Mom and she loves it! I like listening to her sing in Yiddush so clearly and beautifully!!
3,not convincing,"I did not enjoy this telenovela so much because the story was too unrealistic and the actors, especially the male protagonist did not convince me"
1,TERRIBLE GRIPS AND COMPANY,"I purchased child grips from US Glove Inc. and the finger holes are massive on me, an adult. When I contacted them about returns/exchanges, they informed me I must purchase a ""$10 exchange credit"" in order to exchange them or pay a 15% restocking fee. This is ridiculous, especially for grips that are so poorly designed they would NEVER fit any child correctly. What a waste of money! I will have to throw these grips away because I am not going to keep paying them to correct their own problem. I measured my daughters hand to the millimeter and the length is fine but no child with this size palm has this big of fingers! This is their error, not mine but they do not accept responsibility for it. Terrible customer service!"
1,A mockery of real jonny quest,"When thinking jonny quest one things of great animation, quality work, story's that make sense.This re-incarnation of Jonny Quest has none of these things. The cgi art is terrible and painful to watch. The 2d work was no better. The dvd it's self it fine but the contents should be burned for making such a mockery of a good thing. The story lines were nothing like anything that would have appeared in real jonny quest.I was surprised at all the positive reviews for this show. I urge everyone to watch the real jonny quest (1964) and then tell me that this is still a good show.jonny quest fans have been writing this show of for ages and it will continue to happen because it's a bad show. It follows nothing about the original and should not be jonny quest."
3,not enough,"I was so excited to see this release that 'Complete Season One, 13 Episodes' didn't stick out in my head until I actually received the DVD. Thirteen episodes?! Where are the rest of the season? Some of my favorite ones are missing! Heroes? Expedition to Khumbu? This collection is only a blip on the radar of season one! I've been reading other people's reviews, apparently companies will release one season in two sections sometimes? I hope this is true because if we're given only 1/4th of the series I might have a meltdown. How disappointing!"
3,Sexy but not a size that fits all,"I am 5'2, 130 pounds petite with a huge butt and boobs..it was highly uncomfortable for girls with some curves. But my husband pretty much tackled me as soon as he came home from work. So, Unhappy with the comfort but I felt very sexy."
3,Take your time,"This product says one size but what it really means is if you look like the model in the picture it is gonna fit you. Although the straps never intented like you think they would. And to wear this it doesnt show in the back but you really need to have a small behind inorder to fit in it. but other than that I mean the product is great, and holds true to the word of what it is and its pros and cons. Just be careful ordering it about your body type and the one shown"
2,Great but one size does not fit most,"I got this thinking it would fit me just right since my size is pretty average but I guess not. I am a 36C with a 30 waist and 38 hips, it fits like a sports bra which is not flattering at all, and the panites dig in creating a muffin top where I have no extra fat. I am very disappointed in this product. I wish they had sizes rather than one size fits most."
4,Nice,"Ordered the red version because black was out of stock, received a black one anyone. The top doesn't cover as much as the picture shows (I'm a C cup), but it's not a problem given this piece's purpose ;) It was difficult to tell the front from the back for the bottoms, but they fit fine and looked great."
3,One Size Fits Some,"This is a re-review. I did state that the product did not fit as it was listed to be one size. However, the seller was kind enough to allow me to return the the item and replace it with something else."
3,One Size Does NOT Fit All!,"So I figured for the price, I couldn't go wrong with this. I wasn't expecting top notch quality, but I was at least hoping it would fit! I'm a 36DD and my boobs were totally flattened by the top. Not a sexy look which is kinda what I was going for. I think it's cute for the right body type. Try it...hopefully it works for you."
4,Sexy Set!,"I decided to expand my lingerie collection, and was so glad I purchased this lingerie set. I feel really sexy in it, and my boyfriend REALLY liked it! Both items fit me very well! Will buy from this seller again."
4,The Rogue Warrior doesn't disappoint.,"Yet another action filled book by Richard Marcinko. If you have only read one or all of the Rogue Warrior serious of books you won't be disappointed by this one, the Red Cell team are there to follow Demo Dick in making life hard for anyone who gets in his way."
4,Plenty of action and easy to read.,"Put simply I found it a good read. There was plenty of action and maybe the storyline isn't too deep but it is entertaining. The character Trace is a little hard to believe and probably not even needed. In my opinion the best book was the first one, Red Cell, and this book is close to that."
3,BRING BACK THE REAL ROGUE WARRIOR,"Marcinko should stick to the real stories of his Navy experiences, of which he excels and knows best. Fiction with various assistant writers if not his forte, and this novel is one of weak charcters and unbelievable actions - I suppose that the problem in my reading enjoyment is that I'm looking for real heroes and not some action hero like we see in the wild special-effects movies. The writing was okay but the novel wasn't a page turner. I easily put this one down, and several times forgot about it until my wife suggested that I finish it or take it to the library sales fundraiser."
3,Less Roguish than before...,"Perhaps those of us that have read the Rogue Warrior's other books are jaded in our expectations of his novels by now; but this one just missed the mark. There were too many unexplained events, and some explanations were so contrived as to be laughable.I still respect the Commander and will continue to read everything he writes, but he should consider returning to his proven strategies."
2,Absurd!,"In one word.....pithy!I almost actually finished this thing, but I couldnt quite get there. This is seriouslyone of the worst books I've ever read. Its so bad I'm not even going to waste my breathtalking about it. For fanboys only. You've been warned."
3,Not a typical Marcinko Book,"The author tries to throw in a big word or two during the story and it just doesn't sound like Demo Dickie. He takes a sentence off on too many tangents and also has too many references to his past titles (books).So far, this is my least favorite Marcinko book and I have them all."
2,Sorry Dick.....,"My interest in the Marcinko books has tailed off since John Weisman quit writing the stories. Let's face it, Marcinko gives his ""ghost writer"" the basic outline of a story, then tells him to write the novel. ""Violence of Action"" was abysmal. ""Vengeance"" is slightly better, but the bloom is off the rose at this point in time with the Marcinko books. Just go back and read the first two or three novels in the series and see what I mean. I only hope Marcinko stops right now before everyone forgets how the first few books truly excited his fans."
1,Not a page turner,"It's time for Dick to just sit on the porch with his glass of Bombay Sapphire and stop publishing books. Vengeance was extremely tired and boring, no plot and extremely unbelievable. It takes more than glitzy locations and fancy guns to make a story. It also doesn't take a SEAL to make Homeland Security look bad. As Dick has admitted himself, an expert can cause minimum wage flunkies to fail every time. The book just never gets started.Which is a shame, since the original Rogue Warrior is on my list of all-time great books. Dick had a colorful and heroic past which most of us can only envy."
3,Marcinko has written better,"This was my least favorite book by one of my favorite authors. The writing style was clearly not his. It was a fairly good read, and the ending certainly was interesting. But I found the book generally boring and was happy to be done with it. I've never felt this way with any of Demo Dick's books before."
1,??,"What in the he** was this about? Of course I knew what it was about. After reading through Dick's latest novel I found myself lost. All those detailed descriptions of battle, weapons, equipment and tactics are gone; and if you know the rogue his books always had excellant descrips. One minute your slogging through some boring narrative then someone ends up dead or some sort of chase commences.And the team? I miss the plank owners of the past series, excluding Violence of Action. To much time spent writing about superwomen Trace Dalgrehn(?). If you read his previous book: VOA, then you'll know of whom I speak. It's pathetic. I wish I would of waited for paperback- which I recommend.I really wanted to like this one. I really did. I'm a huge fan of the ol' Rogue. I hope that next time he writes on his own. Jim DeFelice need's to leave."
3,Reminds me of an Easter Bunny.....nice outside...nothing inside..,"You know there is a problem when, Demo Dick himself says, RogueWarrior was the best book in the series. And such a TRUE statementthat is. I have read all the RW books and have watched as they havegone down hill with each new one. Vengeance was like mixing, IndianaJones and Murder She Wrote all in one. There is fiction and thenthere is comic book fiction. This book is more like the latter.I have met Mr M,3 times and he is one heck of a guy, but I reallyhope the next RW books are better than the last few."
2,"Couldn't wait for it to end....unbelievable, go for the non-fiction Marcinko","I'm not sure Dick did much of the writing and if he did this book seemed totally unbelievable. I was looking for something I could believe in, but found myself feeling like I was watching some action movie, without all the special effects. It may work for a movie, but the book just did nothing for me. Don't waste your time."
1,Logo falls off -poor quality,The logo is loosely glued to the keychain and the keychain ring is twisted. And already the flashlight got stuck in the off position. Would send it back -but am bedridden. Will not buy from amazon again. Also had another item i received in unacceptable packaging for the price of item and delivery and item has a scratch on it. I thought I bought new. You may find what you're looking for -but it's better to do without than break the budget.
5,Great Buy,I attend fashion design school at WSU and the teacher were Shocked to hear I gat these so cheap and they work fine
1,"Probably great, but it does not fit the 200e",The search engine made it appear that this bobbin fit the Bernina 200e it does not. If you own a 200e do not purchase.
2,"Not a film for ""fans"" of Alan Freed","This is a ""made-for-TV"" movie for people who no nothing about the man and the music of the times. Most of the facts are wrong and the music bits played during the film are sometimes years ahead of when the story is taking place. Being a record collector of the early R & B and doo-wop records, I also noticed that the records that they show playing all have the wrong labels for the song represented. They did not care about getting the facts right. If you just want to see a made up story about a man and the music of the times, this is pretty good.But if you want to see a film closer to the truth about Alan Freed, search out a copy of ""American Hot Wax"". Hopefully, some day, it will be given an official release."
2,not good enough.,Alan Freed really was/is Mr Rock'n'Roll. He deserves much better than this tv movie version of his life and music. Which he and the music got in the yet to be released on dvd. The wonderful 'American Hot Wax'. This movie for a real rock'n'roller is at best ok.Paul Barrett Wales UK
5,Awesome,This movie is just awesome. It is a GREAT movie about how rock and roll got started. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the older rock and roll music and its story.
2,Mr. Rock and Roll: The Alan Freed Story,The movie is not as good as I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be very similar to the other movie I wanted but was not in stock which featured the story of Alan Freed and had lots of original stars doing songs and the rock and roll show. I believe name of movie is American Hot Wax.
1,did not receive this item,"Dear Amazon Team,Sadly this product did not arrive and i am still waiting for it.I hope you can solve this issue as i am a serious buyer and my payments are good.RegardsSiva"
3,"Pablo Casals: Early Recrdings, a defective product",The Pablo Casals: Early Recordings 1925-1928 is a fine recording with a production defect. The playing is obviously great but near the end of the CD numerous tracks are missing. I returned the CD and was sent a replacement that had the same defect indicating that there was a production error.
5,Has everything you need,This book has all the formulas and how to use them in such simple and easy to use format. My reference library would not be complete without it.
5,great first book,"I am the proud owner of eight Lisp books, and this one is at the top of the list for learning the language, because of the exercises, and because Wilensky is a teacher and knows how to teach. You don't learn a language by reading a book, or by reading a specification, but by writing code. The chapters in 'Common Lisp Craft' are short enough to read through in one sitting, but the end of chapter exercises will keep you busy for days. The last two chapters involve real applications, and go much farther than simple beginner exercises.Three warnings:1. My copy is 23 years old (1986 to 2009) and environments have changed, the interface with Lisp in Wilensky is totally out of date and pretty much useless.2. This book alone isn't enough, particularly with respect to macros, quotes, CLOS, and the like, so expect to follow it up with something else from another point of view, like Peter Seibel.3. These is a solutions manual. Get it. You will need it."
2,Not so good for the beginner,"Although the author of the book is teaching my LISP class, the book is very difficult for a beginner to LISP and has almost no actual code to learn from. It tends to be wordy and the examples are abstract and not clear. The author is a really nice guy, but in consencus with many of my other classmates, the book is very hard to learn from and brushes over many topics which I have found covered in greater detail in other texts."
1,Horrible for trying to learn the language,"While this is a good book for a reference to the language, there are virtually no examples of code within the book at all. If you are new to LISP, you will not benefit much by buying this."
3,interesting sequences,This book has potential but the layout made it a tad hard to follow easily. If they changed that then it would get a 4.5 star
5,TREATMENTS THAT ACTUALLY WORK!!!,"I have two dogs that are outdoor dogs which means a lot of fleas. I've tried flea collars but they never work, Advantage but I have Chows and I can't get the drops through their thick hair, Program but I forget the monthly dates and when I do remember they just spit the pill out!! FINALLY, AN EASY TO DO AT HOME REMEDY WITH ORANGE PEELS GOT RID OF THE FLEAS!!! There is so much more in this book that I can't wait to try!!!!!"
5,Great for dog snarfle!,"I've been using Bugs B Gone for several years to clean the inside windows of my cars to remove dog saliva left by my loveable Boxers. It really makes cleaning them so much easier and not much elbow grease is required. It puts other window cleaning products to shame..........great for bugs, too!"
4,Not on DVD? No ratings?,"How did this get overlooked? This is a very worthy movie, consisting of Brad Dourif and James Earl Jones playing two travellers sharing a campfire in the old west, and sharing stories of a rather unusual bent. Dourif is the city slicker type, taken aback by Jone's turn as a rough and tumble mountain man. But he has an ace up his sleeve, in the form of a story. It's just for fun, and it is. Any movie fancier should see this at least once. I don't understand the low profile."
3,Flawed Anthology,"The problem with most anthologies is that you cannot put much characterization into them, and some stories are just plain better than the others. Dourif and Jones' storytelling antics were more entertaining than the stories they told, it was nice not to have Jones sitting behind a desk somewhere bellowing in his famous voice. Here, he MOVES, and is very good. The finale leaves something to be desired, I only slightly recommend this film."
1,Moroccan Red,"I think the color of this rug was beautifull! But my experience w/this rug is not good....it's shed's quite abit leaving red yarns all over my floor I also washed as per instructions on tag and it ""shed"" even worse. So I put this rug away and I don't use it In my opinion,its not worth the extra cleaning and work."
4,Pretty Rug,This was a great rug for the price. Love the color. Only problem is that it is so thick I can't have it near the door to my bathroom because it won't open. Otherwise it's great.
3,soothing yet bland,"Maybe I'm just not hip enough to get it, but to me this album lacks the subtle power of Low, and the complexity and musicianship of Red House Painters and Idaho records. It's pleasant enough listening, but it's more musical wallpaper than an album that draws you in and really gets you thinking.Oddly enough, this band is pretty impressive live. If I were you, I'd use the fourteen bucks to catch their next show and buy myself a cocktail."
5,Don't Miss This One,"Most all of the best 70s albums were live. And this one, my friends, is the best of all the 70s live albums. I really enjoyed Thin Lizzy's studio albums...but I was totally blown away when I heard LIVE AND DANGEROUS.That voice. Those guitars. Perfection. There are many excellent songs here, some that really rock like Jailbreak, Rosalie, Cowboy Song and The Rocker. Some are so delicate and moving that they will rip your heart out, like Dancing In The Moonlight and Still In Love With You.Take a long drive one night. Put this in your CD player. Understand life. It's a simple as that.Thanks, Thin Lizzy. You have brightened many a day for me since discovering this album in 1979. I plan on having a copy of this in my collection until the day I die."
3,IT'S PRETTY GOOD,"THE SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER, BUT CONSIDERING THE AGE OF THE PERFORMANCES IT'S NOT TOO BAD. IF YOU'RE A THIN LIZZY FAN, T'S WORTH THE MONEY, IN MY OPINION."
4,Good live album from th late 70's,This is a good ive cd. It's not quite as great as some make it out to be but like all good live cd's it has some performances on it which out do the album version's of some songs: specifically on this cd Johnny the fox meets jimmy the weed and still in love with you. Some of the weaker performances on it are the rocker and baby drives me crazy. It had for the time a new song oni called are you ready which is a good song
3,Thin Lizzy Rocks,"The CD has some quality issues due to the original recording I am sure. Still, I enjoy listening to the live version of Cowboy Song. The performances were great, but I only wish the quality was better!"
5,Includes Lizzys most stunning recording.,"Not many bands release live albums, that are better than their studio albums, but Lizzy did with this one.It's full of great songs, but if you need one reason is get it, get if for ""Still in love with you"".It's widely regarded as Thin Lizzy finest recording, a love song with Phil Lynott's heartfelt voice and a truly amazing guitar solo.The song is so good, your heart will ache."
5,Thin Lizzy - Live and Dangerous,This item is great to have on CD... I've been wearing it out on my old 8 Track player. I was afraid that it might break. This item brings back so many great memories. It is one of the best tracks that I have ever heard (start to finish)...
3,Bad Sound,"I read the reviews on this dvd and decided to rent it before buying.Smart move cause the sound stinks.I had my 100 watt amp turned up 3/4 of the way and it just sounded like a loud tv or something.At that volume the window should have blown out!! I dont know if there was just a bad run of dvd's or what but check into it before you buy it.I used to have this on VHS HiFi back in the day and it sounded pretty good then,so go figure!! Hopefully they will correct the problem and then I will purchase it for sure cause it is an amazing concert dvd!!"
5,thin lizzy will NEVER DIE!,"sound, agression wildness, taste, feelings, charisma lyrics, this is the ultimate livealbum. I rank Philip Lynott on the same level as Shakespeare, DeFoe! Philip was a poet, a singer, a rocker and there will be only one man like Phil Lynott in our lifetime! Thank's for your time folks!Se ya!"
4,Live and Dangerous review,I feel this is a must have for any Thin Lizzy Fan. A couple area's on the disc sound a bit wavy but I'm not sure why. It's probably from how it was edited. Overall I feel it was a good purchase.
5,"""Live and nice""","""Live and dangerous"" es un DVD donde podemos disfrutar de la fuerza de uno de mis grupos preferidos ""Thin Lizzy"". Phil Lynnot fue uno de los frontman del Rock mas impresionantes que he conocido despues de Freddy Mercury. Este DVD tiene ademas una entrevista actual al resto de integrantes sobrevivientes de la conformacion mas estable del grupo, donde ofrecen detalles de la vida del grupo que eran desconocidas habitualmente por los fans. Excelente calidad de audio. Tenemos entonces un documento visual de una de las mas grandes actuaciones de Rock en vivo de ""Thin Lizzy""."
1,Return,I wanted this DVD for my collection but I had to return two copies because both was sent to me without an audio sound. A concert DVD with out an audio sound is of no use to me
1,bad recording,"Sorry, but this concert is just not well recorded. We lose Phil's vocals as he turns from the mic. In the same manner we also lose sax on dancing in the moonlight, and guitar cords throughout the album. The reason people love this album cannot truely be because it's ""a great live album"", but because it is a great list of Thin Lizzy songs. Honestly, their main albums sound much better! Any other Lizzy album recorded in the 70's dominates Live and Dangerous! I've listened to them all!"
1,These reviewers are ignorant,"For starters, the people who rave about this album must be related to the guys in the band or are complete morons. Look here, I'm a big Thin Lizzy fan ... have been for many years ... so, I'm going through the files and see some of the reviews for this album ... ""best live record ever!!!"" and crap like that ... dudes, I'm soooo disappointed. On the record, nothing about this record is the ""best"" of anything except maybe best piss-poor attempt to rip desperate fans off ... the sound sucks, the selection's OK, but ... saying too much would only give others incentive to buy this thing. Total disappointment."
4,"Live and Dangerous- not complete,but close","This is not a ""complete"" video of Thin Lizzy's ""Live and Dangerous"" LP from the late 70's,...tracks missing are ""Southbound"" and ""Cowboy Song"" as well as ""Warrior""...however,it makes up for them with other footage from a concert with John Sykes.I just wish when companies sell these products, they would sell you the complete show they way I first heard them in their entirety,...nothing less..."
2,Fair Sound,"My dad is a Huge Thin Lizzy fan, so I figured this would be a perfect gift. When we first started the dvd there was no sound we had to go into the extras and sound settings. once we figured out how to adjust the sound the quality was not that great, and we have a rockin sorround sound system? We figured it was because of the recording of the dvd? All and all it was fun to watch but it would have been so much better if there would have been a better recording."
5,One for the ages.,"I have ""Billy the Kid"" and ""Rodeo Suite"" on vinyl and want the same orchestra and conductor on a CD. This one does it all and more. The recording is crystal clear."
4,piece of advise,"Interresting selection especially related to old portuguese fados from Lisabon. I just regret the quality of sound, due to the gravation."
3,Where's the Guitar?,"I was hoping to find a good version of the Concerto D'Aranjuez...I'll have to keep looking. The guitar is virtually unheard on this recording and sounds so terribly thin it is unpleasant. I am very familiar with the guitar parts of this composition and the orchestra completely drowns out most of them. Too bad the recording of the guitar was so unimportant to the engineer - I am sure Julian Bream did a great job in there someplace...The Berkeley and Brouwer, having been recorded at later dates sound much better."
4,Good purchase,"Item received as expected. Band is a little light and probably not as great quality as my other watches, but for the price, it is nice. The face looks quite good as well. Have not had it that long to say how durable it is, but I know that Casio is quite a durable inexpensive brand so I am not worried."
4,Great value!,My new watch is wonderful - now that I got the watch band adjusted. I have a small wrist and the normal adjustments weren't enough. I contacted Casio and they sent me instructions for removing links. Fortunately for me I have a talented husband who was finally able to figure it out and remove the links to make it fit. I can't read the time as easily as I thought I would be able to. The black face makes it a little difficult. But for the money - it is a great little watch!
3,Decent Watch for everyday wear,"I've had this watch for a few months and it has worked reasonably well for everyday use. Given its price, I don't feel too worried if I scratch it or spill chemicals on it (I work in a lab). However, compare to my Seiko watch, this Casio watch is at least 2 or three times thicker than my Seiko watch. This watch is about 8mm (or ~ 3/8 inch) thick, which makes it quite chunky and slightly less elegant. I wouldn't wear this watch with dress clothes, in part because I feel the watch is quite clunky on a petite wrist. However, if you are looking for a watch that can take the abuse of constant wear and tear without having to pay a hefty price, this is the watch for you."
4,Great watch for great price,"I bought this watch to be my everyday work watch and it does the job nicely. I think it looks good, it's easy to read and it's comfortable.The bracelet was huge when it arrived, so my husband had to majorly doctor it to get it to fit my wrist. He's a jeweler so didn't have any problem taking out some of the links. I think for the price you can't go wrong with this watch."
2,Very Cheap Looking Watch,I was so dissappointed to see how cheap this watch looks after it arrived. I have worn it only once and will probably give it away. If you do not adjust the band to fit the watch will spin around your wrist as the watch itself is top heavy. The watch stem looked tarnished when it arrived and the band is very dull. I have seen $10 watches at Wal Mart that are better looking.
2,Works but doesn't fit my wrist,"The watch itself is fine, but the band is not adjustable, unless I take it to a jeweler which will add to its cost."
4,Casio Women's LTP1254D-1A Classic Analog Bracelet WatchCasio Women's LTP1254D-1A Classic Analog Bracelet Watch,"Stars are base on the price and appearance of the product.My secretary likes a lot this watchYes, I recommend this watch for a daily use"
2,Disappointed,This video had some good information but nothing new for most. It was filmed so poorly that we had a hard time watching it. There were three of us trying to watch this film and we all felt the same way. The camera jumped around so much that it was making us dizzy. As if they had a child holding the camera. The video drags and we nearly turned it off. But we hoped it would get better. It really didn't. I would say save your money!
1,Lost For Words...,"I Don't know what to say... Most of the DVDs to come out of ""Reality Films"", Seem to be no more then Pretty pictures, Or One Solid Filming of A Supposed Proffessional, And voice-overs...I don't think any less can be said about this except, is it possible to post reviews with 0 stars or less?Again, Just my Views... Won't be buying any more of this propoganda material... Boring as all hell... Better to watch my computer's screensaver. Atleast the image in that moves..."
4,Very interesting,"I enjoyed the ambiance of this DVD, the music, the images...I thought it was very well done. UFOs, stone circles, quantum theory, dragon lore--many subjects are covered, & they are all covered well."
4,Exciting new concepts,This video is really all about new ideas and information. I would suggest it for those who don't need the Hollywood flash/cheese to enjoy a film. I particulary liked the exploration of crop circles as that topic has always fascinated me.
1,Squealing and cauterwauling,"This video would be infinitely more viewable if the narration were not drowned out by the constant, too-loud squeal of women's voices cauterwauling in the background."
3,Curious about crop circles and UFOs?,"Colorful graphics and regional photography beautifully illustrate this scientific discussion on the nature of energy and its role in paranormal phenomenon, such as crop and stone circles, ley lines, and the link to UFOs. There is a haunting soundtrack from a group called Soul Path and other artists, and a bonus music video as well."
5,This is one of the BEST!,"Avalon has been the end all be all of christian music since I heard of them, shortly after the creation of the group. I have collected every one of their CDs, and have been through the departure of the girls (Niki Hassman and Cherie Adams-powerhouse voice in ""The Glory""). I too was upset by the departure of Michael Passons, just could not imagine songs like ""Take You at Your Word"" and ""Testify to Love"" without him. I have listened to Greg Long, since his CD ""Now"" was released, and have loved songs like ""Sufficiency of Grace"" and ""Face of Love"", but was a little worried about how his sound would fill the shoes of Michael. I have been totally blown away by ""Stand"", its lyrics and tunes. I now see that Greg's voice has transformed Avalon into the ""New Avalon"". This CD is a must for any Avalon fan, and a CD definitley worth the money if you would like to check out this group for the first time!!"
3,"Not Their Best, But Okay","I'm still in mourning over Michael Passion's departure from the group and Greg Long's arrival. They just don't sound like the Avalon I fell in love with, and still miss. I'm having a hard time getting used to Greg's voice; it just doesn't seem to fit right.I'm still getting used to this album; it arrived in my mailbox the day it was released. However, ""Orphans of God"" is by far the best song on the album. They sound like my ""old"" Avalon, and I just love the message of the song. My second favorite song is ""Jesus"". I'm not so sure about the rest of them. Since I've got every album they've produced, I would have this CD in my collection anyway. Their best? Not hardly, but its still worth the money spent to purchase it."
3,Good but not the best,"Avalon is the best in terms of vocal control and blasting messages in the lyrics. This one is pretty strong, but not as strong as CREED (their past album). However, it is still worth listening. Everyone buy it because HAHA they are still Avalon support them!!!"
1,never will be the same again,"They will never be the same since Michael and Cherrie left. Greg got in on the group because he is married to Janna but he does not do the group justice, and why does he look stoned in all of his pictures?"
5,a treasure in a travel book,"I just finished reading the chapter entitled ""The Country and Its People"" in Traveler's Philippines Companion. I consider it to be one of the best, if not the very best, accounts and analyses of the history of a nation that I've ever read. My wife, who is Filipino, said it is easily superior in breadth and depth to what she learned in school. Impressively, it accomplishes this in a most succinct fashion. I never expected to find such a treasure in a travel book. I now feel much enlightened on the subject and therefore well primed to appreciate the country I'm about to visit."
3,Used to be good until this time!,"I used to drink the tea at night and in the morning It was great! Specially for someone that doesn't have regular bowel movements.But this time, my last purchase caused a lot of pain, intolerable cramps, I had the tea at night before go to sleep and 2 hours before the time I usually wake up to go to work I was in excruciating pain, and no bowel movement. Finally in the early afternoon after all morning in pain I had a bowel movement and the pain gradually went away! Now I am not sure why this happened after such long time using the product. I will definitely think twice before having the tea again."
5,Pleased with process,The products were delivered on time and I was pleased with the whole process. Thank you
3,Pointless,I like the looks of this purse but it is tiny. There are strings coming out everywhere. Not a good deal for the price.
4,Robert Dilts' Masterpiece,"When NLP, Volume I came out around 1979, the title of that book indicated that Robert Dilts wanted to write a volume II. Robert has been writing a dozen of books since that time, including the ""Strategies of Genius"" series, which came the closest to the original feat. The current encyclopedia is the result of years and years of work: I saw the first version of the first 3 letters at the NLP leadership conference in summer 1997, 3 years before the book finally came out. The only inconcenience about this encyclopedia is that it is too biased. This is clearly the Encyclopedia of ""Dilts' NLP""Still, this is a book that persons that are really serious about NLP (e.g. people training NLP) should own. END"
5,best in the house yet.,"Dope, dope , dope!!!!! Joey negros best compilation yet. Best in the house yet. Sitting at work listening to sets after sets of various dj's to kill time certain songs stand out in my mind or make me rewind it and play it again. this cd has about 12 of those songs on it. this cd is def worth it. almost every joint is a banger and dance worthy..peace to dave lee"
5,different,"WOW! This is probably the best blend I have ever heard out of the Gaither Vocal Band. Wes Hampton isn't a power tenor like David Phelps, but his voice fills the role very well (Especially on ""I'll Tell It Wherever I Go""). The sound is very different than past Vocal Bands, but will not be disappointing."
5,Into vocals? This is for you...religion or not.,"This is a very strong vocal album. It's the tirst GVB album I have ever owned. I am, however, familiar with previous offerings. Verdict: no dropoff whatsoever. The songs are well produced, clean and crisp. The vocals are impeccable.Marshall Hall and Guy Penrod stand out but all the singers sing well. Of course, some songs are better than others. The same is true with any album.Christian, Muslim, Jew, anything else, or nothing at all...""Give it Away"" is a great collection of vocals. Main stream vocalists would do well to emulate the four men who are the Gaither Vocal Band.Highlights:""Give it Away""""Jesus Loves Me""""I'll tell it Wherever I Go""""My Journey to the Sky""""Why Me"""
4,Loveable,"Even though I was seeking a larger model of this doll and am still seeking same, this particular doll is very cute and adorable. My grand-daughter enjoys it immensely."
5,Solid book...,"Contrary to several other reviewers I think this is a great book. I've studied several martial arts including Judo and BJJ. I'm a good enough grappler to hold my own with most people. Many of the techniques in this book can be found in the current crop of BJJ books. The difference being this book has better pictures and text. That can make all the difference. There are a few techniques that I would skip over, but that could be said about any martial art book that I own.I've always thought of Hapkido as Korean Jujitsu. It is wrong to assume that because a system has kicks it can't offer anything else. Don't pay any attention to the BJJ hype in some of the other reviews. This is a worth while purchase."
2,"Dont buy this book to learn ""groundfighting""","I must admit that this book is well produced. Great pictures and a nice hardcover and illustrations BUT the content is terrible.First of all this guy is a ""hapkido"" expert. He has no business writing a book on ground fighting and the techniques in the book show this. The locks he shows will get you killed against anyone with experience in grappling. If you want to learn real groundfighting buy a book written by someone who is a true expert like Royler Gracie or Rigan Machado. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the most effective and efficient art of groundfighting and is what people really want.Why do I know that this is what people really want? Because if it wasn't for the recent popularity in ""groundfighting"" started by Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu experts such as the Gracies and the Machados this ""Art of Groundfighting"" book would never have been produced. Don't waste your time."
1,Money not refunded yet,"Hi;I'm rating this item with only 1 star because I received a refund note but the money haven't being refunded yet. I don't have a problem in changing the rating but please help me with the money refund or if you can it will be better if you sent the packaging to the following address: 5850 Coral Ridge Drive, Heron Bay Corporate center, Suite. 210,Coral Springs, FL 33076, cell phone: 954- 740-4338 (I'm more interested on having the watch than in the money refund)I'll be waiting for your answer; thank in advance for your help."
2,"good historical photo, not much information","This is a very nice-looking book and it contains many historical pictures. However, I was very disappointed when I got it because I expected it to discuss more about technical aspect of karate (like those of Morio Higaonna sensei). This book is more or less a family historical document. Despite having many pictures (again, usually not a technical one) this book gives you very little information about Goju ryu, Meibu kan, and even Dai Sensei himself (Mr. Meitoku Yagi).If you practice Goju ryu from this lineage, it could be a nice addition to your collection. Otherwise, not very useful."
2,Meibukan - Should Read - Maybe Next Time,"Sadly this book provides very little informative material. The martial arts world would like to see a quality book on Meitoku Yagi and his Meibukan system, this one isn't it...The book only shows three kata of the system, Sanchin, Sesan, and Tensho. The books contains 123 pages of elementary information and little benefit. It is over priced considering the content."
3,Mara Zampieri - ruins a great performance!,"Macbeth is one of my favorite Verdi's operas. This recording conducted by the Late Maestro Giuseppe Sinopoli is a great reading of the score. Renato Bruson sings Macbeth with passion and credibility on the charater however, Mara Zampieri's voice is not on the top of my list for a Lady Macbeth. Her tone-color (voice) is just a little anoying. I have a DVD of hers singing Minnie ""La Fanciulla del West"" and her acting is probably what made her famous but her voice is just not my cup of tea. Overall this recording is great to have because of Renato Bruson and Giuseppe Sinopoli. If you want to hear a great Lady Macbeth listen to the one with Maria Callas / Shirley Verrett."
2,Very bad Lady Macbeth!,"Lady Macbeth is a very bad character to begin with, but it doesn't help to be miscast in the role too. Mara Zampieri should never have been recorded in this opera. Very shrill and much to light a chest voice. Add Sinopoli's gear changes at odd times makes this a tough recording to recommend. The engineering is top-notch, but only serves to highlight the shortcomings of the vocal artists. Sorry, I really wanted to like this one."
1,Disappointing,"This is not a book - it is a booklet, many years old with a musty smell and recipes for items no longer available on grocery shelves."
3,Great first fishing pole,This is a great first fishing pole for a child. It is kind of hard to cast but my son loved it.
2,"cold spring harbor, by richard yates","the contents of cold spring harbor, a very short novel, are suffocated by yates' use of judgment-loaded adjectives and adverbs. hemingway said it all when he advised writers to send a telegram if they wanted to send a message."
5,Painful and brilliant ...,"I read Revolutionary Road a few weeks ago (maybe 2 weeks ago) and immediately ordered a few more by Yates. I'm a big dummy for not knowing this guy sooner. He's a great writer and this particular novel doesn't skip a beat in comparison to Revolutionary Road (also brilliant). No plot reviews here (except to say when the car breaks down, some worlds change) ... buy the thing ... support the craft that is way too quickly dying from brain damaging electronics ...Make believe I'm Obama and trust me on this book ... then order (or go to a library) and read it."
2,Boring,"I realize Yates reached a peak of popularity, especially with his book turned movie, Revolution, but I was neither impressed with the story line or his writing style. I do not recommend."
1,Way too expensive for what you get...,"~$5 is way too expensive for a notebook, no matter how good its quality is. You can get these at local stores (e.g. Staples) for around one buck of equal quality (just not the Mead brand)."
1,only fair.,Copying old catalogs is only acceptable when the copy if readable. I have seen better copies than this - so it was very disappointing. Too many pages unreadable.
1,Held up without a gun!,"A waste! Lots of information but it's very hard to navigate through. Use the internet, this disk is just a colletion of USCG webpages."
2,It Was Okay,"I bought this on a wing, hoping a little more than I got. I saw the women for Christine as Mariane Paroo in THE MUSIC MAN at Bass Hall, and loved her. So I looked at her biography and saw this. I bought it and was a bit dissapointed. The music is good, but not exactly memorible. So if your wanting a change from Webber, this is the thing to get. If your expecting spmthing close to Webbers version, look elsewhere."
1,Lacks something...,"Just listening to the 30 second clips, it lacks something. This verison of Andrew L. Webbers Phatom of the Opera, doesn't have the strong voice, as opposed to the origanal verison. I give this soundtrack 1 star simply because it lacks the strong voices."
5,DEVOTED PHANTOM FAN!,"I first saw this production years ago, and fell in love !It made me cry at the end, to me Richard White is the true PHANTOM! I've seen the production 3 times, and to me this is the true story of the Phantom. The broadway production does'nt tell the true story, the love story that it is. The special unique bond between Christine and the Phantom. At one time these two characters were real people. This truly by far my favorite musical/opera of all."
4,It's okay,"I give a four for good music. I'm afraid it is twisted horribly. The music is wonderful, but I recommend the Lloyd Webber version over this one. there are many beautiful songs, such as You Are My Own (one way it's twisted), and You ARe Music. they're both very nice to listen to. Lio"
3,This musical is teetering on the edge of... BALLS,"I dunno what to think. I like the overture :) Way too happy, prancy, and every other synonym for BALLS. I will not rate it zero because of the overture. The harpsichord part rocks."
1,Laughable,"This musical's only claim to fame is that it's NOT the Andrew Lloyd Webber version.Not even comparing it to the ALW show, it is a horrible musical.Why?1) Bad lyrics. Words picked solely because they rhymed. See, ""horn"" and ""born.""2) Bad music. Ridiculous melodies that sound like they're being cranked out of a caliope or carousel. Granted, they will stay in your head for days. If this is all the composer wished to accomplish, he did a bang-up job."
3,Nothing special,"It's a shame that you can't really talk about this score without comparing it with ""The"" Phantom of the Opera, the ubiquitous Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the same thing. Dramatically, that show is far superior - there is a through-composed, overwhelming theatricality to it, which surprisingly enough is preserved on its CD. This show, on the other hand, is an old fashioned chop-and-drop operetta deal, which although more heartfelt than the slick, ultra-professional Lloyd-Webber version, just doesn't stack up. Musically, they're really equal; this Phantom isn't as well-developed as Lloyd-Webber's, but it isn't as heartless; both have their share of catchy tunes. All in all, this one really isnt worth it. (Don't get me wrong, im no Lloyd-Webber devotee, but his is just better.)"
5,SUPERIOR,"I can't imagine how many people actually entered the theatre thinking they were about to see ""THE"" PHANTOM of the opera (this version slightly predates it) - - well, although NO, this was not ""THE"" Phantom, the audience for sure was not disappointed. In fact they were in for a real treat. In my opinion, the unfolding of the story was a bit corny at times, but the music was memorable... I left the theatre hearing the tunes in my head for days and still do at times... especially songs like MELODIE D' PARIS, YOU ARE MUSIC, WHO COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED. Though the story is sort of a combination of several other well known plays and musicals (I won't give it away), the music well reflects the schism of THE PHANTOM, being both bright, waltzy and bubbly at times (this is gay Pari' afterall) and at other times dark and bleak. I imagine the musical will eventually fade into obscurity, but I hope the tunes will find long lives and you'll enjoy them as much as me."
3,good but not great,"I love Maury Yeston. Nine is one of my favorite musicals. I think the score of Titanic is wonderful. I love his December Songs that Marcovicci sings. But this musical version of Phantom is not not on par. It is pretty, but somewhat disappointing considering the possibilites of what I would expect of Yeston and this material. As much as I hate Andrew Lloyd Weber in general, and as much as I admire Maury Yeston, I must admit that I prefer Weber's Phantom. I have listened to this recording of Phantom many times, and when I try to remember its songs I can only remember the opening number. By comparison, let me say that I can sing the entire score of Nine from beginning to end and much of Titanic too. This is not Yeston's best work. I recommend it anyway to fans of musicals and Yeston, because second rate Yeston is still better than almost anyone else, but I do think it's second rate Yeston."
5,M. E. Kerr's best yet!,"Hello, I lied was the first ""gay"" book I ever read (had the courage to buy?) Reading it was a very powerful experience for me, and I re-read it several times so I could get a hold of all the emotions I felt after devoring it the first time. A truly touching story with real characters who aren't perfect that never deals in black and white Hello, I lied is a wonderful book, and one that I would recomend to any teen, especially if your gay or have a friend who is recently coming out. It's a honest book probably above all else."
2,Pre made leaders are horrible,"I bought this for a day trip since I did not have my furled leaders with me, this stuff is horrible, was impossible to get uncoiled, and the only part I could get to come uncoiled after a while was the tippet. So in the end I decided to cut it all up and make my own out on the stream and the day ended a lot better. I highly suggest to anyone to make their own, it is a great learning experience and you will save money and not have to deal with this like I did."
3,Never Again,Being from Minnesota..I have a biased review of SA products.. Unfortunately.. I hate normal tapered leaders ever since going Furled.. I really wish they would learn better ways to package tapered leaders.. I may think about using them then.. 3pk.. 2 salvageable leaders.. I always have issues with how they wrap the leaders and then knotting up on me trying to unwind them.. 3 tapered leaders will last you a month.. maybe a couple months depending on how much you fish.. Furled leaders will last years.. Stop wasting your money on tapered leaders.. and invest in a furled leader!
3,Just what I had expected.,"After seeing these old-timers perform at the Jazz Fest in New Orleans this year, I had to see if they had any cd's out - and they did! These guys have been playing music longer than I could ever imagine and they look like they enjoy what they do. I doubt that they will ever win any music awards but if you're looking for a fun, cajuny sound this cd has it."
4,A Tribute to Metallica,"""Tribute to the For Horsemen"" could mean only one thing - a tribute to Metallica.This is a metal tribute, but this album also have some exceptional tracks like No. 11 ""Harvester of Sorrow"" by ""Apocalyptica"" which is a violin version & track No. 12 ""Battery"" by ""Die Kurpps"" which is a Techno/Black music version.This album is pretty nice, it has a few good covers as well as 5 unique tracks which you will be able to find only on this album.Summary: Two thumbs up!"
5,Terrific for Kids - Great for All Ages!!,"I initially bought The Harbor Light for my children and my grandchildren. They listened intently to the message of the words, watched in amazement as the illustration pages were turned, and responded with valuable life lessons from the content. What's even more exciting is that I'm over fifty and I found the story applicable to my life and the illustrations delightfully inspirational. I was then thrilled when my parents found joy in the book as well. Even the elderly who are dealing with lonliness and other challenges can find encouragement from this book!"
4,Very Clever Lyrics. Great First CD.,"I don't typically provide reviews, but this CD doesn't seem to get the promotion and attention it deserves. The writing is very clever.Every woman should hear Lipsbury Pinfold when love hits the rocks. The other songs on the CD, like Manhole and Brown, are wonderful, but Lipsbury Pinfold is by the best. Why isn't this song on the radio?This is a great CD and I hope it starts getting some attention."
2,***NOT COMPLETE***THIS SET IS EDITED***,"It's been a number of years since I've seen this show in reruns (on HBO), but it is not hard to see that these shows have been EDITED. There are two episodes (two of my favorites) that I remember well and they are missing at least 3 or 4 minutes each. This set is advertised as the ""COMPLETE Season 3 & 4"". IT'S NOT. It even says ""complete"" right on the front cover.I would think that such false advertising is illegal.I would rather have paid a few dollars more and had these shows unedited. Perhaps if this were a 4 disk set (again, as advertised) instead of 3, there would be room for each episode in it's entirety."
1,FAIL! NOT Complete Episodes,They've edited this set within and inch of it's life. Removed some of the best classic skits like when Ruby and Buddy win the Truck in Hype....gone completely. I'm VERY VERY VERY sorry I wasted money on this. Don't make the same mistake I did.
1,Not the Complete Seasons,This product is states it is the Complete Seasons 3 & 4. But these are severly edited episodes. Original episodes are 24-27 minutes long. These are 10-24 minutes long. So most episodes are missing at least 10 minutes.Tracey Ullman continues the great tradition of the variety series and this was a great show. What a shameful treatment.
2,Tracey Takes On... Complete Seasons 3 & 4,"As other reviewers have stated: the third and fourth seasons of Tracy Ullman's classic HBO series have been edited down to what could and should be called ""Highlights of Tracy's Third & Fourth Season."" It's unfortunate (not to mention extremely disappointing) that the powers that be felt the need to edit down the last two seasons of this wonderful show."
4,Essick Air #1002 Humidifi Replacement Parts Kit,"Essick Air #1002 Humidifier Replacement Parts KitThis is just what my humidifier needed, hard to find in local stores and not to many found on the Web. I would purchase again if needed."
4,includes hit's from the bong remix,"Good stuff, bass heavy remixtr.1 We ain't goin' out like thattr.2 We ain't goin' out like that(radio edit)tr.3 We ain't goin' out like that(intrumental)tr.4 Hits from the bongtr.5 Hits from the bong(T-rays Mix)tr.6 Scooby doo"
4,Pops Roundup,Heard this music years ago. Had the record and wore it out. Then recently thought of Amazon and discovered the music again. Great!!
5,corelle storage,Very useful. You can serve and store in these. I love that they nest together to save space.
3,Bali Chain Review,"The bracelet is of decent quality. The reason I purchased the bracelet was because I lost the original one purchased in Afghanistan. This new one was not of the same quality (welds are more obvious, links not as smooth, stiffer less fexible chain links), but will serve the purpose as a souviner/keepsake. Overall a 3 out of 5 for quality. Pertaining to service; it arrived very fast and in quality shipping material. A 5 of 5 for shipping."
2,A Weak Biography,"I just purchased this DVD for use in my high school English classes, and I am quite disappointed to find that it contains very little biographical content about Shakespeare or discussion of his works. Instead, much of the half-hour program is devoted to Elizabethan architecture, London attractions of the time, and even clothing styles worn. This might be useful for someone interested solely in the historical context of Shakespeare's writing, but viewers will learn little about the playwright himself, or his world-changing plays."
2,Africa for the Africans,"Very well written & I read it from cover to cover - fuming. I've lived in East & South Africa for most of my life although I was exiled in England for 17 years. Never mind that Theroux has also lived in Africa, he is a miserable depressed man who has no empathy whatever of either the difficulties nor the pleasures of this continent. It's all very well for him to criticize the governance & the efficiency of this continent, I do so as well, but most African countries like Kenya, even more delightful Tanganyika, are dirt poor in resources & the plutocracy is tiny. All the Brits go on about the White farmers, the Happy Valley set & so on but the fact is that making a living here is a pretty hardscrabble life. The wonder is that almost all Africans are friendly & helpful, really some of the nicest people on Earth! Of course, it does help to approach them as human beings, be outgoing & speak a useful language like Swahili."
4,still going strong,Volume two finds the New Avengers still going strong dealing with a major super prison escape and the Sentry is back.
3,Not as good...,"This wasn't as good as the first volume of the New Avengers. The Sentry storyline was confusing and didn't seem to clear things up well at all. The villain entries at the back were informative and brought back a lot of memories from over the years, but was too much filler for my dollar."
3,"Beautiful artwork, lackluster story","The artwork in this series continues to excel but unfortunately the sluggish plotline underwhelms. These issues concern the mysterious, nearly omnipotent superhero 'The Sentry'. As dozens of assembled superheroes battle a physical manifestation of his dark side, Emma Frost enters his mind in an attempt to reverse a psychic virus therein. The majestic two-page panels throughout the volume are the highlights."
1,very disappointed,Choppy storyline. Didn't like the flashbacks to the old comics. Felt like the author was struggling for a story. Usually a big Bendis fan but not this title.
1,"New Avengers, more marvel B.S.",This new avengers book is more of marvels great line of crap. If you have any apperation of any of the heroes in this book don't get involved with it. They ruin the image of wolverine. he gets his butt handed to him by Spider Woman. NOT Cool. When will marvel get their act together. Stay away from this one.
1,garbage,this book is a complete and total waste of time. this is one reason why palmistry can not seem to take hold the way astrolog has in our culture. it gives you no clue at all how to see what the patterns really mean. this is like bad fortune telling.
1,"Nice idea, but disappointed","I bought this clock for my father who is a big John Deere buff. The clock itself is cheaply made, however I wasn't expecting fine craftsmanship here. The most disappointing part is the sound effects. The speaker is horrible, every tractor sounds alike. It just sounds like noise coming out from the clock. Very muffled. I would advise anyone against buying this clock."
5,Good clock,"This clock comes with glass as opposed to plastic cover! Don't see that much anymore. Keeps accurate time and has a built in sensor to tell day from night, so the sound at every hours does not happen when the room is dark, considering you don't use a 60 watt night light. My son likes it alot and it draws the eye to it when you enter his room."
5,My dad LOVED this clock!!!!,My father is a great John Deere fan and at first i thought this was going to be kinda cheap and cheesy. My Dad Loved it! The sounds are all real and none are the same. He hung it up at work and has nothing but compliments about it! Great buy!
1,Does not work,I have talked to several people that own this clock. It does not work. The sounds are nothing but a growl. No putt putt. Don't buy this clock if you want sounds. Other than that it is nice looking and keeps time.
3,"ok, not great","The wings are poorly soldered to the back of the piece. They bend easily, and one of mine has broken off completely.It's hard to find really high quality dragon items. I'm bummed that this is just one more of those flimsy junk pieces. The design is neat, and the photo makes it look really cool, but it's just not well made.Wear with caution."
2,Dirty and blackned,"Many places especially on the wings and seal, it is alot black and it makes it look very dirty. I did not like this dragon necklace and I think it could be better because it looks like it is made by an amateur. I am not impressed.It did come with a standard chain and a pouch for the necklace though."
3,"Alright, I guess",I thought I was buying a Paperback book and got a hardback. The book was in great shape and got here really fast. Just wish it had been a paperback to match my other books. Great Seller with great prices.
4,BUY ME,"I think this is a must have for all drum 'n' bass lovers along with the album, 'Field of Action'. It starts off with a chilled beat before it kicks into something a little harder with a lot of pace. Suitable for playing in bedrooms!"
3,"It's not ""Prague.""","Arthur Phillips proves with ""Angelica"" that he can master diverse novelistic styles with grace and ease. While perhaps too much of a Henry James homage, the story is told from the perspectives of 4 different characters (very ""Rashomon"") and is diverting throughout. I thought the novel became somewhat belabored in part 3, but I'm glad to have read it. I didn't read ""Angelica"" in the order in which it was released, so I have to say that it's my least favorite of Phillips' books, but an OK novel by such a clever writer as he is still worth the time spent with it."
2,Ehh..,"I purchased Angelica because I wanted to read a good ghost story, and I heard that this was a good one from three different points of view. Okay...now I don't want to spoil anything for people who may like this book (from the reviews there are a few) so I am just going to say the following: the first part of the book was interesting, the rest, well...not so much. As soon as the first part was over the book became very boring and predictable.I just don't feel that the book is worth more than two stars. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,potential unrealized,"I wanted to like this book, I really wanted to like this book. I read it in only a couple days, not because I was utterly enthralled by the story but because I couldn't wait to be done with it.It's a ghost story. Or is it? I can't possibly say after having read the whole thing.One good thing about the book is that it's told in four parts, each focusing on the same story through the perspective of each of the four main characters. That in itself could have been pretty interesting if it weren't for the overly dramatic and confusing language which at times is so overly flowery that it's unreadable. At times I found myself skipping over entire passages (if you make it through to read some of Dr. Miles dialogue, you'll know what I'm saying).In the end I'm not sure if it's a ghost story, a story of madness, a story of unwarranted blame or WHAT. Very frustrating book."
1,50-page-rule goner,"After forcing myself to give this book the benefit of the doubt for 50 pages, I finally decided to retire it. The writing style, while eloquent, was a little over the top in victorian vagueness, and I found myself getting extremely impatient with the characters. Perhaps I will try again after reading some other books I have on my shelf, but for now, this book just didn't have what I was looking for."
1,our whole book club hated this one,"Our book club read this one and everyone hated it! It was the worst book we have ever read, boring, confusing, and tedious. Most of the book club didn't finish it, the ones who did were not impressed."
1,Just Couldn't Get Into it,"Can't put my finger on it, but I really did not like this story. I read the first 3 or 4 chapters and just couldn't get into to. I really did not like it."
5,Loved it!,"I really enjoyed this book. I finished it in two days I was so absorbed. This book may not be for everyone. I however loved the themes of miscommunication, fear, distrust and the paranormal set against the backdrop of victorian england; a setting where each of these things was bubbling under the surface of polite society. While it was heartbreaking to read about Joseph and Constance's marriage falling apart, it was fascinating to read how both contributed by hiding their feelings, fears and motives. This is a great book and I recommend it for anyone who likes a creepy story and/or the mores of victorian england."
4,Great watch at a great price!,This is a nice watch. I purchased it for about $21 and have been very pleased. I've received lots of compliments and enjoy it daily. Recommend.
5,An outstanding watch!,"A beautiful looking contemporary woman's bracelet watch at a price that cannot be beat! And as the reviewer below describes so well, the links can be removed relatively easily to adjust the length. Rest assured, you'll be very pleased with this purchase."
4,little bulky,"Band and depth of watch face quite large, bulky like a guys watch, but feminine looking. I have largish wrists so fairly happy. Crazy cheap for what you get."
3,casual gift,"I was looking for a not too expensive women watch, and I found the exact product for a casual gift. I like it."
4,Fine and resistant watch,I purchased this one for my wife and it looks very nice. Suffice to say this is a good looking and resistant watch.
4,Nice Item,This item is good. Neatly and securely packaged. It worths buying it and is good for a loved one. I will recommend for people who want to surprise lovers and friends on occasions.
5,Nice Everyday Watch,"Just before the holidays I misplaced a Citizen watch, similar to this one, that I had been wearing for years. After much searching of my house I decided I would have to break down and get a new one. The face on this one is a little larger than my old watch, but I am finding I like this one better because it has a second hand. Got a great price on sale and would recommend this watch for anyone looking for something that is servicable for everyday use and stylish as well."
5,My wife like it,"I bought it for my wife,she wear it in the hand every day.she like it ,and she happy so my happy ."
5,Casio Women's Watch,I chose this rating because it a truly a great watch. It is stylish and It fits on my wrist perfectly.
4,Very good book,"Guilty Pleasures is a unique book in that it has so much to offer and it raised some serious questions in me. The author got her point across with inspirationals and wisdom. Kudos on that. Simone and Andy had a doozy of a relationship. Out of control dysfunction. However, the author left me hungry for more drama from the gay neigbor who was HILARIOUS, and I think she will come back at us and give us that more...Miss Harris is a writer and has great potential. I look forward to reading more of her work."
4,Coming Out of the Darkness,Guilty Pleasures is a deep read that explores one female's (Simone) personal struggles to hold on to unhealthy relationships that were doing her more harm than good. The words of inspiration really added spiritual value to the story and for that reason I was able to understand why it was important for Simone to free herself of unnecessary baggage and ultimately find peace. This book was good for my self esteem as a woman.
4,Good & Interesting Story,"Truth should have been the title of this one. After reading the opening remarks, I had to ask myself if I had the courage to go any further. What an incredible story of strength on Simone's part. She endureth the storm, but stayed soft too. Attention: These are not the guilty pleasures you think they are. It's about life and the *ish that goes down everyday! Pick it up and don't put it down until you get to the last page. I'm glad I did.Maria T.Roxbury, MA"
4,The XX or Double Cross Op misled the German Secret Service,The Author was one of the few who ran the double cross system in MI5 using captured spies they ran back false intel on the planned invasion of France. Making the German's think that Normandy was a ploy to weaken the fortifications at Calais. The Best agent was codenamed GARBO whom the German's still believed in at the end of the war. They fooled them with false bomb damage reports from the V1&2 Rockets causing them to aim the Rockets short therefore missing London. A Great book on the Secret War.
1,boring,"I heard this author on the radio and he was fascinating, but this book is incredibly repetitive and boring. This work was originally a military report and it sounds like it. No one would ever confuse military writing with literature."
5,Time for a reprint?,"Since this book has received nothing but 5-star reviews and is generally thought of as definitive with regard to the material it covers, surely it is time it was reprinted so it can be enjoyed by a wider audience? There may be those who can afford $600 for a 242-page book, but I regret I am not among them.Given the continuing interest in The Beatles and the ongoing re-issue of many of their works, the publisher seems to be missing a trick here. Let's have another edition, please!"
4,Sizzling Jungle Adventure,"Margaret Watson has written a wonderful adventure full of sexual tension and suspense. Female agent Andi McGinnis must transport an infant through a Central American jungle. She is joined by a man from her past who has every reason to hate her, but can't no matter how hard he tries.The passion runs high as they risk their life to do the right thing."
4,A few good songs,"I really enjoy listening to Jeanette's music. She's quite popular in Germany, where she's from, which is why it is sometimes difficult to find her CDs here in the States. I especially like her single ""Rocking on Heaven's Door"". This CD has a few good songs. ""Right Now"" is by far the best."
2,too much psycholgist lingo,"I found this book to be a little to wordy from a psychological standpoint for me. The personal stories were interesting, but about half way through the book I had lost interest. I much prefered Sylvia Brown's Psychic Kids or anything by Doreen Virtue. For me, the reason I read a book like Hart's is for the personal stories not the scientific explanations for the events."
2,Lacking even the basics,"I agree with the reviewer from Boulder. Close to eight hundred bucks for the I,II,III Spanish series and two very ordinary verb tenses are ignored ( The imperfect past, and the simple future). These two verb tenses are used so much in common speech that anyone studying Spanish who lacks them will be very confused by ordinary conversations. Maybe there should be a Spanish IV."
3,Not nearly as good as levels I and II,"Compared to Pimsleur Spanish Level I and Level II, this course sounds like a very rough draft. In fact, it's a first edition, whereas the others are second editions; you'll notice the difference. Recording quality here is inferior (but acceptable), and the teaching is often rushed and confusing. However, it's still better than any other recorded language course I've tried, and I'm marginally glad I bought it."
1,Rip off,I purchased a Basic French Learning Disk for $59.00 included shipping and handling. I received two more charges for $ 59.00 on my credit card. I had not approved these charges. I believe their online product is a consumer rip off.
2,"Unworthy to be called level III, but nice basic review.","You know you're in trouble when a level III Spanish listening course begins with lessons on how to introduce yourself. What should be a thorough review of conversational Spanish coupled with an intensive introduction to future, conditional and subjunctive tenses is nothing more than a cursory review of first semester Spanish. Granted, listening to all the conversations on these 24 CDs will undoubtedly help your pronunciation and ease with common conversational situations, however, why should you or anyone shell out nearly three C-notes when you can get the same and more from the Barron's Institute ""Mastering Spanish Level 2"" for less than a Franklin. Of all the audio-language learning courses I have taken in French and Spanish, Barron's is by far the best course and the best value for the money."
1,"a disappointment, even for a martial arts book","There is very little text to explain any of the techniques, merely a series of photographs for each, and a page wasted (left blank) for ""seminar/practice notes"" after each technique is presented. Hard to believe an editor actually let this go to press, but maybe these are sold at discount during workshops.Secondly, there are only sixteen techniques in the book. Nineteen bucks for sixteen waza is pretty steep, especially when the waza are not really covered in depth.Anyone interested in hanbo should not waste any time on this book, but instead get Hatsumi's Stick Fighting manual, which covers over 50 techniques and contains text a whole lot more informative, even translated from the original Japanese."
4,good glasses,It's a very nice sunglasses and it was such a good price. It was bigger than I thought it would be but it looks really nice.
5,finally,"A film that shows the neurotic side of some lesbians. A film that proves to me that I am not the only lesbian in the US who would doggedly pursue any tidbit of information on a famous person I presume to be a lesbian. Hey, I'm not proud of it....but it is certainly calming to know there are more of us out there. Simple dialogue and charming characters made this a very enjoyable movie."
4,"This is a movie about history, visibility, and identity","The central quest of this movie is the search for a kindred spirit in the past. Too often history ignores those who are not affluent, white, and heterosexual. Cheryle Dunye's search for the long-forgotten and unexplained ""watermelon woman"" she spots in an old film becomes a quest to affirm her own place in history as a black lesbian who is indeed a real person with a voice."
5,you just don't want to part with this film..,"Was it Jamaica Kincaid who said that there are books you just can't part with? That you just have to take them with you after you read them at, for instance, a library? (Well, whoever it was, was she justifying book thefts? I like to think so, for I understand such a quick and strong 'attraction' to certain books myself. There really are books that you can't part with.)The minute The Watermelon Woman played on the screen, I felt that can't-part-with-this kind of instant affection toward it. It was funny, honest, and cool. I collect DVDs and this one surely made the top on my list for future purchase. I'm almost grateful to the school I attend that its library has it in its collection. I had an absolutely good time watching it."
3,Good product...but a little expensive.,"Product is fine. Exact replacement for the case that came with the tools. Was a little hard to find and was a little expensive, but glad I was able to get a new one."
1,Badly Bound,"The book content is quite fascinating; the only real readability difficuly is some rather obscure and undefined notation.The physical quality of the book is inexcusably bad. The brand new book started falling apart as soon as it was opened. Springer Verlag, the publisher, refused to correct the situation.I shan't again buy anything publishd by Springer-Verlag!"
5,Perfect Tool,This is the perfect tool for cutting flexible conduit. This item is hard to find at at big box stores.
2,Not up to Greenlee's standards,Not nearly as good as Seatek Roto-Split. I t also was damaged when received and had to be taken apart and fixed. At least I think it's fixed.
5,Perfect,"Works great, and is just what you'd expect :). The gears are durable (though I've only made a few cuts) and make clean cuts."
2,"Good concept, poor content, lacks detail","The video covers what could be interesting and important joint locking and joint control techniques. But the videography is terrible. It looks like they had the video recorder on a tripod 10 meters away and filmed this in one or two sessions with NO closeups. Even though I am an experienced martial artist (17 years), and aficionado of joint techniques, I could not figure out the hand and finger positions the people used and described in the video. The subtitles had poor English so additional detail could not be gained there. From the distance the techniques were shot it looks like they have some interesting methods and techniques, but there is almost no way even experienced practitioners would be able to apply these without multiple trial and error sessions. I gave it 2 stars because there is potential there, but all and all it is a disappointment."
2,Widow's Kiss,"I have read many historical romances and found this one two slow with too little character development. The story idea was sound, but you didn't care enough about either of the main characters. The story was slow to develop and even at the end of the book I didn't care what really happened to either of the main characters. I enjoyed the children in the book more the two main characters-not a good sign. This is the first Jane Feather book I've read, and I'm not sure if I will read another."
2,Not her best!,"I am disappointed. Her other books were so much better. The best part is her historical perspective, but her main characters are just not believable. The story is not believable. How her main characters decide they are ""connected,"" is not even believable. Save your money and buy some of her others."
3,Need to measure,While this cable works and I have had no real performance issues with it. It's true length is closer to 18 ft..
5,Fast,"This ethernet cable has a good protective coating, removeable metal clips, heavier duty plastic clipsand a good twist resistance. I was running it through the wall to provide service to my entertainment center,worked perfectly, speeds as advertised."
2,Disappointing.,I bough this tent for a four night outing and sprayed additional waterproofing on the sides and on the rain fly. The first night it rained hard and water was coming in through the top of the roof. Everything was soaked. The next day we had to go into town and we bought a tarp to go over the top of the rain fly. It continued to rain and we had less water in our tent from the roof but were experiencing leaking from the tent walls. I wasn't real happy with the windows either. There is a full screen that makes it look like a full window but they all zip down about half way and the rain fly is covering the areas of the windows so it is tough to see out. :(
3,good summer tent,"Nice tent, very spacous. However the package was missing poles and the open screen area in the center of the tent appeared to be very succeptable to wind and rain. It comes with a nice rain fly but again the screen area over the door appeared too open to prevent heay rain from entering. I returned it and bought a Coleman tent with less open screen area."
2,It's worth it only for diehard La's fans,"Now that I think of it, if you are a diehard fan you probably own this already. And I'm sure, like myself, you were a bit disappointed with the first listen. True, there are a few standout tracks (most notably ""Open Your Heart""-truly amazing). ""Sweet 35"" as well as ""Moonlight"" and ""Dovecot Dub"" are very good, but overall the album is lacking. If you were hoping for lost Lee Mavers gems you will be terribly disappointed. Although Mike Badger can write some fair lyrics, he can't hold a light to Mavers' genius. Buy The La's instead, you'll be much happier."
1,An interesting sidelong glance at the great man,"It is refreshing to see A. N Wilson trying to take a somewhat critical view of the ""C. S. Lewis industry"" as he calls it. He attempts to make some controversial new highlights but to my mind he does not quite make it. He has a lot of information here but it is not put together more convincingly than the books written by the fans of the Narnia man. As he was a professor at Cambridge I think there are plenty of people who would have ""blown the whistle"" if he as many dodgy things as ANW makes out. And - it's just occurred to me - who is ANW to criticise the CSL industry? he is part of it too now..."
1,Not Worth the Paper,"Simply the worst biography I've ever read. Another A.N. Wilson ""work"" .. namely ""Dream Children"" .. a modern ""Lolita"" fashioned in the likes of the works by Vladimir Nobokov are also indicative of the intents and character that Wilson so obviously portrays. Sad."
3,Interesting academic look at famed Author,"While the premise of this biography is clear throughout, and since most of the structure of this book is lifted in large portions from Lewis's SURPRISED BY JOY, and a few more published works, what makes this biography interesting is the account of CSL's intellectual and literary development in Oxford Academia. The expert analysis of the subject's training in the Classics, then as an authority in Medieval literature is unique. To understand CSL's ability to have written the treasured books so popular now, one must learn about his academic career, which is here excellently depicted."
2,"An uneven, untrustworthy biography","It was very strange reading Wilson's biography. At times, he seems very insightful and wise, with helpful and true comments about Lewis's character, his relationship to friends and household members, and his books. At other times, he seems like an educated fool, quoting things out of context, reading things INTO Lewis's life and works that aren't really there, misrepresenting facts, creating fictional sources, or making up comments to be presented as truth. Although Wilson sometimes presents many individual parts of Lewis well, the composite figure does not add up. As George Sayer - Lewis's friend of nearly 3 decades - noted, at times the portrait of Lewis is almost unrecognizable. There are better biographies of Lewis available. Skip this one."
5,A Tender Look at C S Lewis,"If you're looking for an enlightening look at the life of C S. Lewis and his cult following, look no further. This book takes a tender but blunt look at the life and writings of Lewis, as well as those that passed through his life. This book feels slow to read, but with good reason: it's a book to be cherished and savoured. Curl up with it during quiet times, or when you have insomnia, and you'll suddenly find yourself in the same room as the creator of Narnia himself. This is a touching read, and especially appropriate for junior high, high school, or college readers just discovering Lewis or wanting more information about him."
1,Embarrassing,"This story of C. S. Lewis is told essentially as by a nurse (Wilson) to parents (we) about a problematical small child (Lewis). Wilson appears to be never in doubt that he understands his subject better than it ever understood itself. His cocksureness is the more inviting since he pretends to be rescuing Lewis from a perceived danger of becoming a ""plaster saint""; it is the more embarrassing since he is incredibly careless in his use of the sources and has a proclivity for the very basest forms of gossip. If some Lewis devotees have lacked interest in the real man, Wilson has clearly surpassed them on this score. This biography is eminently readable; but its appeal is vitally rooted in the author's cocksureness, sloppiness and bad faith."
1,C. S. Lewis in the dock,"The man of Shadowlands and Narnia, C. S. Lewis, gave the task of writing his more or less official biography to two people. The first of these was his friend for many years, the author Roger Lancelyn Green. The other was his personal assistant for several months near the end of life, Father Walter Hooper. Their book is a bit dry, but it does seem to be a fair account. They had many advantages beside personal knowledge of the man himself. Abundant access to C. S. Lewis's private papers, to Warren Lewis his brother and to many of Lewis's other friends and acquaintances. George Sayer knew Lewis well for years and wrote what you might call the 'friend's biography', with some surprises and some dull detail. Mr. Wilson puts Lewis in the dock, and goes against all of these others and has no real witnesses to prove his case. I don't think a judge would throw the case out, but I do think the jury might send him packing and award damages to Mr. C. S. Lewis."
3,Easy to Read & Understand,"This is a small vest pocket book. It is a spin off of the living bible. It has no concordances and is a text only New testament. If you need a small Testament to cary & read, this is the one to buy. Its easy reading for the new Christian."
4,songs for children,This is an old collection of children's songs. It is used in Sunday School and Children's ministries. I would recommend it.
4,Scary...very scary!,I heard about this author on NPR and ordered a couple of her books. If you like a good scare and a mystery you would enjoy this. I must add that this one is not for the faint of heart. It is terrifying.
4,A Parent's Worst Nightmare,"Mo Hayder once again brings us into the dark world of DI Jack Caffrey. This time the case revolves around another madman capable of unspeakable acts of perversion. While not quite as gruesome as ""Birdman"", the mental imagery in ""The Treatment"" is equally disturbing. Jack is brought to the edge of his own sanity, as he cannot ignore the case's apparent connection to the disappearance of his own brother decades earlier. Another well written page turner by Ms Hayder, I look forward to the next installment. Once again a warning, like ""Birdman"" this novel is not for the squeamish."
2,Plenty of Shock; very little suspense,"I really enjoyed 'Birdman'; particularly for the way the author gave us insight into both the 'good' and 'bad' guys. I was anxious to read the sequel, 'The Treatment', hoping that Hayder would find an equally interesting story for Jack Caffery. Unfortunately, I find 'the Treatment' to be an almost formulaic repeat of 'Birdman'; with many similar plot elements. I could guess many of the plot developments. Although the topic of pedophilia is as taboo as necrophilia was in 'Birdman', this just felt like Hayder wanted to be shocking, not suspenseful."
5,A book you'll never forget,"This book is definalty for those with strong stomachs. It will keep you on the edge the entire time. As the story starts to unfold, you frantically search for clues about one man's past, but only in the very end is completly revealed. Mo Hayder successfully paints the mind of a killer into a book, a ture terrifying masterpiece."
3,Good grief! This is truly nasty.,"The rather demure-looking Mo Hayder writes somewhere on the cusp between crime fiction and grand-guignol horror, and has produced one of the most hideously grotesque novels I have ever read.As a scarily plausible insight into the mind of a sadistic, psychotic paedophile, it is undeniably, a very competent achievement.As entertaining fiction though .... well I'm not so sure. I felt no satisfaction in actually finishing the book, which made me feel like some guilty voyeur at the scene of something extremely nasty.This is unremittingly grim stuff. If you like a happy or even a satisfying ending, I would give this a wide berth.Horror buffs, even the most jaded, should certainly find something in here to melt their butter.Me? I felt like I needed a bath afterwards.Beware!"
1,Think again,"The main problem with this book is the psychology of the characters. They all felt wrong considering what they went through which was quite a lot. A lot of tediousness in terms of detail that has little significance to the whole point of the book. I also don't understand the significance of some of the events once you reach the end. In the end everything is left hanging in the air and incomplete. The subject matter is really depressing too, so defnitely not for anyone looking for any sort of inspiration."
1,pretty bad,"This documentary was a big disappointment. It is ameture video of 2 - 3 guys who were old class-mates of MaCartney and Harrison, walking around Liverpool, showing the places they used to frequent (in the 50's & 60's). No Beatles music. no relevant history of the band. Just, ""this apartment was John Lennons for a few months"". Its kind of funny, because in a few places, they are commenting on some landmark but only one of them has a microphone, so there is just a blank pause where the un-miced guy is commenting. Its THAT ameturish. I guess they didnt bother to watch what they recored, let alone edit it."
3,Positive but Political,"I found this book to be a positive addition to my collection of rural ministry-focused material. However, I did find the over emphasis on Eco-Theology and the liberal political slant a bit overwhelming at times. Not all patriotic groups and citizen action movements are ""hate groups"" as presented in the text. These comments can leave a bad taste in the mouths of devoted, Christian constitutionalists working in rural ministry."
4,A Handy Guide for the Inept,"Overall, this strategy guide is above average, assuming you have no idea what you are doing. Most people can beat the game simply by reading the booklet that comes with the game, but if you can't pick it up, pick this up"
1,mistake,"sf planet sends me the wrong product. I contact them and they assumed the error, but after a long e-mail conversation, they suggested that I should keep the charger they send (for Motorola), because they think it will work in my blackberry...fast e-mail reply, but finally no solution for me (the customer)"
4,"Works, Original fuse blew in a months time.",Original fuse blew out on me after a month of little use. After replacing it everything works as planned. I did receive a OEM blackberry charger and even after the new fuse its still 1/3 the price of a store bought one. Still highly recommended.
1,Chinese Knockoff,"Great price but charger doesn't work. Shows that is charging but never registers on the Blackberry. Typical Chinese product, looks great but doesn't work."
3,OK,"It's pretty flimsy, but works fine. At this price, you could go through 10 of them and it would still cost less than buying one from Verizon."
1,Never worked from day 1,"Don't buy this product, it is a waste of money. It never worked from worked from day 1. Cheap chinese made electronics."
1,Doesn't work,This phone charger didn't even fit the phone that it said its supposed to fit. Huge waste of money.. and it took forever to get here.
1,Incorrect image,"The image shown for this charger is incorrect. The actual part is one with a retractable cord which isn't worth the plastic it is made of. Mine arrived 2 days ago, and was dead right out of the package. Piece of crap. Spend a few extra bucks at your local Verizon or similar phone store and get a real charger."
3,Bad clasp design,I Loved this bracelet when I saw it. It is so pretty and I bought it in memory of my dad. The only problem is it has a bad clasp design. It is just a hook that goes through a loop and it has fallen off of me about 3 times in 2 days. It was a good thing I was home or in the car or else I would have lost it. It should have a lobster claw clasp.
5,Great Read,"Amanda wakes up after being in an auto accident not remembering who she is. She has a husband who can't stand her, children who are afraid of her, and no real friends. As she tries to figure out about her life pre- accident and rebuild her life with her family, ghosts from the past come back to haunt her in a big way. The title of the book very much reflects Amanda's situation. This is an excellent book and very well written, I've read it more than 10 times since buying it, years ago. If your just looking for a good book to read, I would say get this. It has mystery, intrigue, romance, danger, and much more."
5,Trpjan War rocks! NO sisylala's alowed!,"Hewitt is wonderful she plays an anti-girlie-girl who faces the same problem I do with her best guy friend, I highly recomend this movie for a night of romantic comidy."
2,"Predictable and intermidable, but some OK characters.","This movie was predictable and seemed to go on forever, but Hewitt and Freidle had great chemestry, and their two friends were pretty funny. The girl, though, the one that Friedle was trying to sleep with, was so much less cool than Hewitt, and a slut besides. Was the guy COMPLETLY blind? The biggest problem was how boring it was. I ended up fast forwarding through about half of it. Oh well."
5,This movie was the best movie I've ever seen.,I love this movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Will Friedle were great in it. The whole theme of the movie and how Will was trying to get himself laid was really funny. I loved the turnout of the movie and who he had chosen to be the one for him.
5,you must see this film!,"i've seen trojan war many times, yet no matter how many times i watch it, i never get bored of it. it's one of those films that's ALWAYS fun to watch, and it cheers you up if you're feeling down. there's this song at the end(when brad thinks he's getting what he wants), that really adds to the whole effect of the film, the problem is, i dunno what the song's called, so if anyone does, please e-mail me at blackvelveteen69@yahoo.com cheers ~caitlin~"
3,Quite good for a direct-to-video release,"Biggest problem: Will Friedle, who tries hard but is simply not a good enough actor to make this movie as good as it could have been. Biggest asset: Jennifer Love Hewitt, who delivers a very good, slightly offbeat (for her) performance. I was surprised that Leah was very different from other characters that Hewitt has played. The movie was predictable but entertaining, with an ending that's worth waiting for. (At the end Love Hewitt says ""What?"" twice, and the second one turned my knees to butter. The only time that a single word made an entire movie better!)"
1,Predictable piece of smut,"This movie is awful. Possibly one of the worst I've endured in quite a while.Terrible plot, cliché acting and quite possibly the lamest script ever. It's like the directors decided to purposefully go about rendering the viewer an official retard by killing off all remaining brain cells.One step up from Americas Unfunniest Home Videos, the part where this 'story' was (un)successfully made into a released movie fit for human consumption is beyond me. This movie puts the art of directing, script writing, acting and comedy to uttermost shame. The script reads like it was written by a three year old. On crack.To conclude this little tirade, don't watch/buy/steal this movie. It might kill you."
4,I thought it was good.,"I have seen it before on regular tv, one of those sunday afternoon things. I thought it was pretty good, but I also like JLH as well, and feel she wasn't in the movie enough. Thats my opinion though. Still, it was a good, goofy movie about teens and love. Pretty typical story line and was predictable, but how can one assume its not with the actors/actresses that are in it."
3,Liked it a lot but where do I find the soundtrack???,This movie is kind of predictable - but who cares? It's good entertainement and it has a happy ending. But where do I find the soundtrack????
3,It was OK!!?,"I think Jennifer Love Hewitt is an awesome actress, but she could have been in this movie more. It was histarical, but the plot was completely predictible!"
4,At least she was in this one!!,"I got to tell you, it was funny seeing that guy get banged around everywhere, what a ...! He was a terrible actor, can't act worth beans. Again, the movie savour is JLH again! How many movies can she save? She's just awesome! Especially the part where she immatates the other girl! Anyways, if you like to see that guy being banged around alot, this is a good movie, if you actually like this guy, well, I feel sorry for you, the only thing that saved this movie was JLH and the funny bad guys. Who were one of the most different bad guys I've ever seen! This is a good movie, rent it or if you can find it anywhere but here, buy it!!"
3,ok teen movie,"Trojan war is an average teenage movie, and has a pretty positive message to it aboout safe sex. Even though it seems like a giant ad for Trojan condoms, it still has some charm."
5,happy happy,"I have been looking to buy this movie on DVD for a few years. My man surprised me with it for Christmas, yay! I've watched it several times already. There are no extras, not even a preview. I don't care though. If this is something you have wanted, don't hesitate to purchase this nostalgic film."
5,Excellent utility knife,"The black oxide finish is nice, although frequent drawing from the kydex sheath will result in marks being left in the finish. The steel is thick and strong, and has handled being used as a pry multiple times very well. The lack of serration makes it easier to sharpen without special tools, so that can be a plus. The base of the knife makes an excellent hammer as well. It's well balanced right at the hilt with an extremely good checkered pattern rubber-like grip even when wet.The sheath is my only complaint. Sheathing it at any more than a slight angle will result in catching in the sheath very tightly. The top part of the snap button also came off after a few months of use and the rubber securing strap it sits in wears down, revealing some sort of plastic fibers which annoyingly catch on clothing. The sheath is also wider than it needs to be.Excellent knife, but they could have done better with the sheath."
5,wheels to go,This is an outstanding book. It is well written by two women who have had to find wheels. It is written so it can be used as part of the curriculum for Orientation and Mobility training for visually impaired students.
2,Extremely Corny,"These jokes are really bad. And I don't mean that in a good way, like bad pizza. These stink. Certainly there are a few chuckles hidden in the pages, but you could do much better than this."
3,OK but you have to suffer.,"I love Dean Martin but I detest Greg Garrison who narrates ""and ruins"" anything having to do with Dean Martin. I have a complete set of Martin's TV shows and Greg Garrison ruins every disc - you have to jump over his nonsensical narrations - who wants to hear Greg Garrison blab? Anyhow, got this DVD 'cause I had to have it. So, buy it if you love Dean but you will suffer with the narrations if there are any on this DVD."
3,The Road Not Taken...,"I got here last. Purchased and throughly digested the other albums first. The Biz still thrills. The newest stuff less so. But I can't help liking nearly everything The Sea and Cake have put out. Both Parasol and Earth Star are terrfiic, tender and smart songs almost too pretty-just great. As for best of the rest on this album- it strikes me that the music explores a slightly different territory- Not much worse than where they eventually ended up but not quite as good. Although some of the rawish gravely openness would be useful in cracking open the overproduced smoothness of the tunes on Oui."
4,nice historical recording,"Nice to hear the composer play his compositions, the recordings are due to the technique rather flat (less dynamic) than modern recordings, and strangely the background noise can be heard more in a car than when listening to a hifi installation at home."
3,"good music, difficult listening","The music is always glorious. Unfortunately, however, Jed Distler's comment in his review that ""RCA's transfers...could have been better"" is an understatement for those like me that might be stereotechnically challenged. The recording ""noise"" can make for painful listening at times. It's himself, though, so I'll grit my teeth."
5,Really great,"This C.D is excellent. The playing from the composer himself will teach you very well how HE wanted you to play it. As for the slight crackling, they can't help it!"
3,Remarkable album - poor sound quality,"I agree with reviewers heaping superlatives about Rachmaninoff playing Rachmaninoff. It is truly a rare gem. However, buyers should be aware that the recording quality is marginal and tape hiss nearly unbearable. No blame here - it was probably the best technology of its day. If you are used to modern recordings of concert performances, you will need to set an equalizaton to moderate the high tape noise. A good DSP unit might be able to extricate the music from the noise. In any case, once acclimated to the sound quality, you will adore the underlying performance."
5,Learning how to be a music dilletante,"I really think that people should spend more time learning about music (and playing music) before they decide to review a CD like this.I am shocked to see that people find Rachmaninoff's interpretation of HIS works inferior than somebody's else. Certainly, it is delightful to listen to Horowitz, Richter, and Volodos playing Rach. But now we are talking about listening to the composer of those works playing them. And I'm sure that Rachmaninoff knew what he was doing while recording his music."
4,casio watch,"Item arrived quickly and in good condition. However, the battery lasted only two days!!! I wasn't very happy about that. I had to spend $8 for a new battery."
1,Awful,"The watches band is a childs size, very small. The watch was not working when it arrived. I would not wish this watch on anyone. Amazon was fantastic and had UPS come to my door about 8 hrs. later with a return label to return it to Amazon. Amazon was also very nice and helpful on the phone. Amazon I can say does stand buy their name ! Lynn"
5,Are you unfashionably desirous of a watch with a face that is not larger than your own?,"Do you not care that your 40 year old daughter and every catalog in the country seem to think that the thicker and larger the watch, the more attractive it is? Do you JUST WANT A SMALL SIZE watch face so you can TELL THE TIME, without wearing something chunky and obtrusive, and either hopelessly expensive or tastelessly tacky, that is so big it is wearing you? Did you spend about four hours on Amazon going through watches only to find, when you read the small print (and I mean the VERY small print) that the average watch covers the entire front of your wrist?Rejoice, fellow fashion challenged friends! This is it! Small, quiet, and ALL IT DOES IS TELL THE TIME. Oh yes, it also lights up, but it even does that unobtrusively. AND IT'S CHEAP. You will thank me. Unless you are a die hard fan of chunky, in which case don't buy it."
4,Simple and sleek,"I adore my wristwatch. It's great because the bay area rains pretty often during winter time, and so it being waterproof, I don't need to worry about it. Or even going to the bathroom to wash my hands isn't too much of a problem. I wouldn't risk submerging it into too much water, since if you pull out the analog thing, water could go into and ruin it. But it's really pleasing to look at and it functions like it's suppose to. I do wish it had a stopwatch or timer function, but then it wouldn't have a clock-face."
3,it's alright,"I used it as an everyday watch, however it got scratched within the first month. It's water resistant so I could shower with it, but the face is a lot smaller than expected so it's inconvenient when i want to just peek at it while riding my bike or just whenever."
3,Average Hat,"100 percent cotton, Made in China, ordered 18 Jun, recieved 29 Jun, really floppy/soft.Ordered size L, which is a snug fit for my 7 1/4 head."
3,Love this hat - BUT.....,"I wish it had some wire embedded in the rim so it could be adjusted. It's very floppy and sometimes interferes with my vision. Otherwise, it's perfect."
4,Nice camping hat,"Nice hat for camping or hiking. Good quality for the price, would of given it 5 stars if it came with the side snaps."
2,Cheap and floppy...,Pass on this hat. It's very cheap cotton and you can tell won't last very long. I returned mine because it just looked so cheap :/
1,Hat needs more of a brim to truly protect the Face.,I waited a while to buy this hat and well I wish I had invested a little more to keep the sun out of my eyes and off my nose and cheeks.The brim of the hate is not as pictured. The offering of larger sizes is what made me try it out. Not useable.
3,Quirky,"I'm going to say that the best bits of this miniseries are the beginning and end spots by the guest stars -- Sarah Silverman and John Cho's intros are notably hilarious.Talking about the main dish, though, Backwash has a playful and quirky sense of humor. It doesn't take itself seriously, which is a strength and a weakness; a strength in that, even if a joke falls flat, you don't get that awful secondhand embarrassment for the guys, because it's obviously just in good fun. The jokes that didn't work for me didn't make me GROAN, which is a bonus in a comedy. The jokes that did work had me laughing out loud in surprise. The pacing is great, even if you dislike it, you won't feel bored out of your mind. The episodes are short and the narration snippets break up the story into manageable little bits.In any case, it might not be for you. It wasn't really for me, but I didn't regret buying it."
1,Not worth the $1.00 Red Box Fee,"Horrible, absolutely horrible. It's like watching a tree stooges movie only they forgot the funny.The only redeeming quality is the chapter intros by various actors and comedians, you will find yourself fast forwarding past the movie, just to catch the chapter openers.Worst movie I have seen in a long time."
5,The plot had me hooked. I had to see it through.,"A very intriguing read.Even though my copy was bound with entire sections out of order, I was able to find my way through the book and read it all - in proper order. Every time I thought the plot was heading to its next logical conclusion, author Pfarrer managed to very believably take it in another unexpected direction. So, I had to read the plot to conclusion.A great book!"
5,Fascinating!,"Given the controversy of Pfarrer's ""Seal Target Geronimo"" I decided to read ""Killing Che"" and ""Warrior Soul"" for background. This book is intriguing, impossible to put down. Cross referenced some details for accuracy, spot on. Immediately identified with all his characters. Pfarrer blends the facts with fiction in a logical credible manner. Most fascinating are how he thoroughly understands the contractual nature of third world corruption, motives and consequences of brutality.Little sympathy here for Che. A colorful misguided zealot with all the human frailties and more. A cold blooded killer.Working towards credibility on the real OBL kill. The author is exacting, resourceful and knows The Business. The powerful potential for parallels are more than possible."
2,the glory that was Rome .... not!,"There is no excuse I can imagine for what Bennett has done here: he's made Trajan BORING. He's taken a life that's so sparsely documented and yet so temptingly exotic and grand, and he's shot it, stuffed it, and mounted it on a dusty back shelf in some dim-lit basement. This may be fine scholarship (in fact, to give the book its due, it IS fine scholarship), but it does no good service either to the non-specialist reader or to Trajan himself, who still awaits the biography he deserves."
3,Not the best shoes I had,"The shoes overall were quite normal, except they got worn out very quickly. The leather got worn out and it looked like a 5 year old pair of shoes :D Although the look in the beginning wasn't bad and looked quite trendy. Was quite comfortable to wear, as well. I through them away after wearing for several months."
3,"I can't believe you all thought this book was great, or even good ...","The 1/2 to 2/3 of the book was decent, but after that, it became comical. AIDS, Swingers, faking death, killing neighbors' dogs. Please. The legal ""drama"" was also a joke and completely unbelievable. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I won't go into anymore details, but a book that started out well turned into a joke by the end. It turned into something a 9th grade writing class would come up with. I'd give it 2.5 stars."
5,A SUPER HEALTHY VERSATILE FOOD,"I've eaten Kasha all my life and I'm 66 years old. We always had it as a breakfast cereal and many times for dinner cooked with onions and chicken broth; on many occasions we added pasta bowties. Today I am a diabetic and kasha is a life saver because it is the only grain cereal I can eat a nice big bowl of and it doesn't 'jack up' my blood sugar and it has a nice glycemic index in that my sugar level remains at a constant level for quite a while and then drops slowly. If I eat oatmeal, cream of wheat, or corn meal mush; my sugar goes above 200 and then drops like a rock after my morning hike. With the same amount of kasha, the level never exceeds 140! Besides the health benefits, it tastes so goooooooooooood!"
2,"Should be titled: ""Diary of a fascist""","Only in ""The Rape of Nanking"" have I read a tale of such remorseless killing. The author personally tortured, hung, and shot numerous people, and the disturbing thing about it was how casual he was in doing so. Considering that he fought the Nazis in WWII with the French resistance, it's surprising how much he seems to have become like them (and how much the French occupation of Algeria looked like the German occupation of France). As for the book as a whole, it's well written and provides an important perspective on the conflict given his key role in it. It also provides a little bit of historic background about how the French experience in Vietnam, the rise of Arab nationalism etc. helped fuel the conflict. But all in all it's a pretty distasteful book (and that's from a person who's read lots of war chronicles)."
2,Not enough details,"Rather than calling this book ""Mastering Tomcat Development"", it should be called ""An Overview of Tomcat"". The book covers a lot of topics. But it only scratches the survace of everything, without providing enough detail to be useful. I read it through once, and got an overview, but now it just sits on my shelf."
1,WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON,"THIS IS, QUITE SIMPLY, THE SILLIEST WORK OF FICTION I HAVE EVER READ. I NOW KNOW THAT J.J. MURRAY IS A CAUCASIAN MALE POSING AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE WRITE. SO SILLY!!!!PLEASE - SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! VERY BORING."
3,Murano sunshade,"This is the only sunshade big enough to cover the windshield of my Murano. It does work very well to block the sun and heat. The only thing I don't like is that the sunshade is so stiff that it is a pain to stash when I have a passenger in the car. On the other hand, the stiffness makes it stand up in the dashboard area and achieve 100% coverage. Overall I like it."
4,how Tangerine Dream would sound now if they were still cool,"This album should not be confused with the one released in 1997 by the R&B balladeer of the same name, and to which the other reviews on this page erroneously refer. This is a 1996 sound project, reminiscent of labelmates Trans Am and Tortoise, but more left-field than both, if such a thing is possible. Probably too left-field for those who enjoy the other bands' sense of composition and tune, but the perfect record for modern experimental music connoisseurs. Because Rome is on the Thrill Jockey label, Tortoise mainstay and uber-producer John McEntire makes an appearance, which is always a welcome addition."
5,Worked as a perfect replacement for the GSW690iii,Was looking for a replacement eyepiece for the Fuji GSW690iii and this fit the bill. If anything it is better than the original with a bit more padding / softness.
3,Decent back up flash for photography within 5 yards,This flash is okay but only if you use if for photography of subjects closer than 5 yards in average night-time darkness.
3,"Good for the Money, but no cigar","Good enough for a po nigga like me, but no comparison to the Nikon 800. Main problem is that bounced flash images come out too dark when used with my coolpix 8400. And direct flash ones come out a little bright. Can't adjust this without going all-manual on the flash, which is a pain. But all images are redeemable with a little photoshop.I mainly use flash for fill flash shooting into the sun, and it does its job.Good buy for po folks."
4,Flash Review,"Its simply what i was looking for.The only problem it has is the instructions manual. But still if you are looking for a good flash that isnt very expensive, here you have your solution."
