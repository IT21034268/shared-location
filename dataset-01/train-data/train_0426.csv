4,Get Ready for Halloween!,"We specifically purchased this DVD to prepare our daughter (age 2) for all the spooky things she would see when the Halloween decorations came out and trick or treating began. We started watching it in September and by the time she saw skeletons, spiders and ghosts she loved them all. She literally wanted to ""hug"" spider and skeleton decorations that she saw. It helped make what could have been scary, fun for her.The jokes throughout are a bit much and go right over a toddler's head but in all, it's a fun show and we have enjoyed watching it!"
3,Elmo Says Boo!,"My son hasn't shown any interest in watching this video. He is 3 years old, and this video just doesn't keep his attention."
4,If your child likes the count....,"they will LOVE this video! My kids adore the Count (when we go see the Bats at the zoo, they say AHH AHH AHHH). Its got lots of old/new snippets about spooky things. The songs Bones is especially good. I recommend!"
5,Great!,My daughter who is 22 months old loves Elmo so this is a great DVD she watch's it over and over again..
3,My 2 year old son was scared when he saw this one,My 2 year old son loves Elmo but this video was no fun at all. He was scared and promptly asked to stop the video. We sent it back to Amazon
1,Woefully out of date,"I bought the ebooks version of this, and was extremely disappointed to find it was a re-issue of a book last issued in 1989. The author's personal story is interesting, but the medical information is seriously outdated, and the tone is very depressing."
4,CFIDS help book.,"This is one of the better books on CFIDS.It covers the Social Security appeal process so you know what to expect.The book covers the author's experience and his wife's since 1982.The book covers symptoms, diagnosis, understanding your illness, treatments, depression caused by CFIDS, coping, financial hardship, advice for friends and family. There is an interview with Anthony Komaroff, M.D.In the Appendix covers where to go to get some help."
3,Disney watch,Watch is listed as unisex but seems a little too small for a man. Watch face is slightly bluer and less dark than expected. Still perfectly acceptable.
2,Self-Referential work,"Ms Snow quotes J Goebbels to the effect that the intellectual content of propaganda need not be high, then continues to demonstrate the same concerning books about propaganda. Her opusis a sketchy collection of ultra-left agitprop, and is published by the same people who bring us N. Chomsky and Angela Davis. I givetwo stars since the book has merit as an object for study. Theediting of the book is amateurish, with misspellings, mispunctuations and contains the very odd word ""lookyloo""."
4,LB remixed,"""Same S!@#$ Different Day"" is one of those rare occurances where the remix album is stronger than the original album. I thought the original Later That Day was good but it didn't do that much for me. This remix album is underground hiphop from the bay area, with good beats.The Quannum-label as usual, means it's good stuff. The beats are stronger on the remix album. The songs seem to have more energy.It's odd that the album is tighter on the second go-around. Well worth the affordable list price!"
2,Two-dimensional,"Nothing about this movie--people, on-screen characters, town, Depression--seems to interest Allen enough to do more than nod in their direction.Miss Farrow inhabits a vacuous character fully."
2,Not compatible,Unfortunately this DVD was not compatible with my player and I ended up throwing it out instead of bothering with the return. This is not like me but I have been overwhelmed with too many other more important matters. I gave it two stars for prompt delivery. Sorry this didn't turn out better for the supplier and me.
5,Woody Allen At His Best,"Woody transports us to a world of sorrow and stress during the depression. A woman so unhappy she loses herself in the movies where the lead comes off the screen, literally. True love. Heartbreaking and beautiful."
5,romantic!,"this movie touches the heart and proves that dreams can come true. it is funny,sometimes sad but all around a good movie. it stars jeff daniels and mia farrow and they could have not picked a better couple. they have so much chemistry. i would advise any one to watch it and enjoy!"
3,Tossing Pennies For Fun And Profit,"It surprises me to learn that this is Woody Allen's favorite among his films, because in my opinion he has made many movies that were much better, with some of his best work of all appearing in the last decade*. Watching this film reminds me of reading a first draft of a manuscript in that it came off as roughly sketched and unfinished, and the ending, a surprise I admit as well as being admirably bold, seemed to come along in place of an entire missing act in the story. (OK, I understand perhaps WHY The Purple Rose of Cairo ended as it did but should it truly have ended WHEN it did?) My words here are meaningless, I know, since those who love this film have their reasons for loving it, it's obviously long since too late to change anything, and I'm not here to discourage someone from seeing it, but I will say that this wasn't the movie I was expecting and it wasn't one I came away from feeling like I'd want to see it again.*Midnight in Paris is brilliant!"
5,Amazing Matthew 24 exposition,"The exposition of Matthew 24 in this book is worth double the price of the book. It is a superb reading of the olivet discourage that gives a coherent preteristic interpretation of the passage that is totally convincing. This is the book to get for those that do not understand the olivet discourse. The best exposition of it I have seen, it's worth the price of the whole book.The rest of the book isn't as good as the Matthew 24 exposition, the first part is a bit boring and the Revelation 20 exposition has a lot of good insights but also some glaring flaws.None the less, I strongly commend this book to you for understanding our Lord's words in Matthew 24."
4,Interesting For What is Not There,"This book is written by a genius, no doubt. Nevertheless, it was helpful to me to see how Kik denied every account of the second coming in Scripture, while still affirming that Christ will return bodily. He denies that the reference to His coming in the Olivet Discourse is about His second coming. Instead, it was about the fall of Jerusalem and Judaism. He denies that Rev. 19 is about the second coming. That is about the progress of the gospel in this present age. When you get to the end of the book you see that Kik affirms the second coming as a doctrine, but denies that biblical portrayals of the event is about that doctrine."
2,Psyche-Drone experimental minimalism - not much here,"Was and am a fan of Riz's preceeding works, that said there is little of that here. The funky downtempo, jazzy breakbeats, and warm fuzzy, well timed sample loops that made her so enjoyable to listen to before is non-existant here. It's one thing to progress, and quite another to genre hop off the dancefloor alltogether. The lively metro feel that surged with life and love, gave way to a non-melodic dissonant hanting soundscape of psche-drone. Just not my thing."
5,Excellent!,"From its earliest known beginning in 1629 in Salem, Massachusetts Bay Colony, The Shoemakers traces the history of that trade in colonial times. The technique of shoe making is explained in detail, and the illustrations (by the author) are wonderful. It's almost like spending the day next to a master craftsman as an apprentice.Leonard Everett Fischer is one of the most honored writers of literature for children, and this book is evidence of his tremendous contribution.Highly recommended for young readers or adults interested in diverse aspects of colonial history."
4,Not guilty by reason of insanity: One man's account,"Professionals spend too much of their time in the proverbial ivory tower and don't even know it. In fact, there seems to be an inverse rule at play. The more time in the ivory tower the less in touch we become with the subject of our study. Mr. Starr shakes us, and wakes us up from our slumber, and helps us to refocus our attention on what's really important, namely, the inner workings of an individual's mind. Mr. Starr is honest and not afraid to share his thougths with his readers- even though these same readers are oftentimes taken aback with his disclosures. But, afterall, how else can we really know ""what lerks in the minds of men and women"" unless they have the courage to tell us - based on their sense that we will both listen and respond, not judgementally, but with compassion and knowledge of the human condition? Mr. Starr has given us one more important opportunity to understand what it's like to play with a deck without all the cards."
2,My kindergarten teacher daughter says it's not good for children,"I thought it sounded like a good book, but after I sent it to my daughter for her daughters, I found out what it was really about. Opps! Not the best choice in my opinion either!"
5,Thidwick is always remembered,"This is a wonderful children's story that I remember reading as a child. It has such an impression on me, I never forgot the story nor the moral that Dr. Suess implied in this tale."
5,Best Dr. Seuss Book ever written,"I first read this book when I was a little girl. I was really impressed with it then, of all the Dr. Seuss books I thought it was the best because of the message. The poor moose is so soft-hearted, he lets everyone take advantage of him. It has a wonderful message for children to learn about ""users"". If you only read one Dr. Seuss book to your children, read them this one."
5,Good book,"What can I say, everyone already knows all about doctor sued books. Kids love them and they are quirky and entertaining for the parents"
2,"I guess I'm the only one, but.....","Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Dr. Seuss fan. We have almost all of his books and love reading them. I bought this one as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old son and we were so excited to read it. The story starts out super cute with a moose that has uninvited guests in his horns. But the ending is disgusting. The guests all end up stuffed up on a wall. The last picture is of the animals mounted on a wall with little Xs for their eyes. I did not want to get into a whole discussion on hunting and taxidermy with my 2 year old! Again, we LOVE Dr. Seuss and read at least one of his stories every day. I just thought this one was a little nasty....."
5,THIDWICK THE BIG-HEARTED MOOSE,"By far, Dr. Suess' best. Too bad this book is not acknowledged and advertised as his other silly books are. By far the best for the simple moral message a child can understand for years."
4,Nice rhimes but you need to be ok with the book's message,"The book is of course fun. It is the story of a moose that is nice and kind and taken advantage of by other animals...until she breaks free and learns to take care of herself (or put herself first).it is a little dark in its message. SPOIL alert: the animals who take advantage of the moose end up dead.It gives the message that you should care for yourself first.Not a bad message by itself and certainly in the context of this story it makes sense, but some parents might not be ready to discuss such a point with their young or very children.Overall, the book is nice but the message is such that you need to know you might get more questions that you are ready to answer."
1,Just Say No,"This is a great movie. But I wouldn't recommend that you purchasee it. Buy the ""season one"" DVD set. It includes this film and let's face it... The season shows really built on this film. Kung Fu was an awsome series, and more is more in this case."
1,Becky Dull : The Castration of Vanity Fair,"I know it is very very late to critique this film. The horse has long since left the barn and the farm but when a film is this atrocious an additional warning cannot be amiss. The performances, cinematography, etc. are exactly as you expect them to be for a film this expensive. But it is all for naught. The screenplay and the idea behind it are so awful that no amount of technical excellence could salvage it. A collection of morons decided to extract the heart of Becky Sharp. The very thing that has kept people reading her adventures for 200+ years was judged as inadequately upbeat for the American public. It is a deeply insulting film. Their Becky is sweet. Vanity Fair is a cinematic hatchet job; they gut Becky."
3,Actually 3 1/2....,I didn't really know anything about this movie but was drawn to it because of a preview (beautiful colors and music) caught my attention...but the movie came up a little dry for my liking. The plot kept skipping around and at times it took a while for one to figure out which place in time were in. And I was confused quite a bit--maybe the book would help!?!? I also found this movie to be a bit long at 2 hours and 21 minutes. And I can stay focused only if I am into a movie and this movie I was not that into. I think it had great intentions and could have make a great movie but for us who needed some information or something to make this movie flow better it was just two hours of eye candy...nice looking actors and bright bold colors and great music especially the Indian music.
2,Modernly Tainted Fluff,"It's seems that history, in any context, is so boring to people in this day and age, that even movies are being doctored to be more appealing. NOTICE: The early 19th century depicted in this movie is not of reality! Not even the clothing or the hairstyles were accurate here. The meticulous researchers from ""Titanic"" are probably shuddering. But aside from the visual fallacies, there is the whole issue of the dance scene, an Indian spectacle put on by miss Becky and some noble ladies. In the 19th century, a woman didn't show her ankles in public let alone her midriff! That entire scene was in the realms of fantasy not only in the behavior of the women, but in the music as well. Please, if a director is going to make a historical film, let's at least hope that he likes the era enough to portray it correctly. To see this era depicted correctly, see ""Immortal Beloved"", or any of the Jane Austen films."
2,What can one say?,"Victorian England meets Bollywood with a splash of Sham-Wow! The people who made this movie cared more about visual style than actually telling a story, any story, let alone the story in the book. There is no continuity of storyline it is rendered in leaps and bounds, a good majority of the acting is very very bad, and the characters are badly miscast. The costumes were awful, the hairstyles copied from Spock, and the aura was the Roman Empire under Tiberius and Caligula . How bad was the actor who played George?!?The only ""bright spot"" if you can call it so, is Reese Witherspoon. I would say her acting is acceptable and sometimes good, but she is no Victorian Woman.The book is a masterpiece and this movie is one HOT mess."
3,"Entertaining, but no point...?","Ok, I haven't read the book, and I can only say...I hope it's better than the movie. The characters were all very believable, and the acting was darn good too. Costumes and scenery, camera angles...great. But what gets me is the lack of overall purpose to the movie. I mean, the main point about the movie is Becky Sharp, supposedly, and yet her character doesn't seem to come to a realization or change or resolution...or anything. Still, entertaining and well done, and like I said, I don't know if the book is as unresolved, so perhaps the movie made the best of it. Worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,It was good,"It was good but not a movie I would watch again and again. Reese was good in it, but she looks too modern."
3,Historically interesting,Beautifully photographed. The historical elements were what I found interesting. The story itself meandered a bit like Barry Lyndon.
4,Vanity Fair Review,"This is a decent movie, although I must admit that I am partial to stories from this time period. It is not my favorite movie, but it's definitely not even near the worst. This is one of many movies that I can watch more than once, find small subtleties I miss each time, and still be entertained."
5,Vanity Fair,"If there's one thing I'm getting tied of it's the old the-movie's-not- exatly-like-the-book complaint. Of course not. If every movie was like the book they would all be unbearably long and BORING. Artistic license must be taken, and allowed by the viewing public. You purists most learn to enjoy movies based on books for what they are.I love this movie. I'm glad Reese Witherspoon made Becky a more likeable character. She's still plenty ""bad"" enough.Bravo, Reese!! And everyone connected with this film."
3,Harlot Francais,"Becky Sharp comes off more as mischevious than evil (as Thackery clearly intended she be.) The characters motives are confusing, and Amilias poverty seems random at best. Among other things, George Osbornes ""affair"" with Becky seems very watered down, and seems to say ""well, it wasn't Becky in particular, he just didn't love Amilia."" Which is all wrong. The end of the movie seems to insinuate that Amilia's son is seduced by Becky and that Becky ultimately marries Jon, Amilia's blundering older brother. The worst of it was the costant singing, at every party she attended. We GET IT! SHe can sing! Now please, no more, we beg of you.All in all, the movie was good, mainly thanks to the cinematography and vibrant colors or the film. The acting was well done if not too mild."
2,might have been better if it had been longer?,"My husband and I were lucky enough to see this as an advance screening, but the lucky part was we didn't have to pay to see it. The costumes and settings are absolutely fantastic, lush and colorful. The acting was wonderful, and was inevitable because of the astonishing list of actors. Especially if you follow British Theater, you recognize actor after actor. And Reese has more depth to her acting than I had realized.But the complaint is the editing, the sheer choppiness of the story line. By the end of the movie, my husband and I had joined others in the theater who were laughing at supposedly serious parts. For example, someone falling madly in love with someone they hated one second ago.I recommend A&E;'s version instead. It is over 5 hours, but the story lines are so complex, it just doesn't work otherwise."
1,Holy Crap this was horrible,"Time seemed to halt while this movie was playing. I remember thinking that it must have gone on for two hours, looking at my watch, seeing it was only 30 minutes, and wanting to cry.Go if you have insomnia. Its confusing as hell."
2,BUTCHERED,"I really love Reese Witherspoon, but this film is completely different than the book, and I think you should not change something unless you can make it better. I find it hard to belive that someone could improve the original story. This movies portrays Becky and all the females in a completely sympathetic light. In other words, they modernized the story, made it politically correct, and took out all of the humor, wit, and edginess. What was left is a dull, preachy, bland waste of time. Don't ruin a masterpiece!"
5,Wonderful period piece,I liked the movie alot. I love period movies and this is the third on my list.
1,Do not waste your time or money on this film,If it was possible to give this film a minus 1 I would have. Thackery must have rolled over in his grave at a very poor attempt at writing a screen play for his masterpiece novel. My DVD copy will go in the trash bin.
4,Excellent Rendition,I found Vanity Fair an excellent interpretetion of Thakery's book. I Thouroughly enjoyed it and recommend it.
2,Reese Witherspoon can't save this,"I bought this thinking I liked period dramas. I've discovered, I don't. I can't even sit through them (much like Emma a couple of days ago), so I'm not holding out much hope for Pride & Prejudice.Normally I really like Reese, she's good in Cruel Intentions & the first Legally Blonde film. This? She disappears a lot of the time, only to pop up at the oddest moments, and she's very obviously pregnant (with her second child, Dylan) during it! They tried to cover it up as much as possible, although at least she had cleavage-enhancing outfits a plenty, you can sometimes see the outline of a bump. But she's not as good as she was in Legally Blonde.I also thought Johnathan Rhys Meyers would be good in this too, he was lovely in Bend It Like Beckham (mainly the Irish accent), but his character is a bit of a prat in this. And the hair what a mess!!!I just wasn't impressed by this, and managed to sit through an hour before I gave up. I hope Pride & Prejudice is better."
2,REESE COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER MOVIE RATHER THEN THIS ONE!!!!!,I recently just saw this movie the other night and i was totally excited about seeing it!!!! When i watched it i was bored to death there was no real good story to this movie and i thought that Reese Witherspoon could have done another movie rather then this one!!!!!!! I wouldn't go and rent this movie again or even buy it!!!!!!! All i can say is that i wanted more and what i got was just another bad flick!!!!!
2,Like speed reading the book,"If you like speed reading (a page every couple of seconds), then you'll like this movie. Think fast forward through the book and you'll get the sense of the movie."
1,Horrible waste of money!!!,"I was really excited about this movie, that is until I sat down to watch it. It is so confusing and long I had to stop it and try watching it again later. Even the second time around was bad. The story line is hard to follow and the characters are not well developed. Don't waste your money!!"
2,A RAMBLING & AIMLESS INTERPRETATION,"While the books are classics of a genre, Vanity Fairthe movie, is a long and pointless period piece. Theacting is uneven, and the weight given to plot issuesinconsistent. Small moments are fleshed out with greatfretting, while major life changes of great gravityare fliply offhanded in a moment. There are passages,where significant emotional reversals transpire overthe course of two or three sentences of dialog, and nosign of wear or consequence. The wardrobe and sets aresplendid, but they do not carry this otherwise dry moviethat skitters across the veneer of meaningful exchanges.A trash novel ""chick flick"" of nearly the worst order.A much better choice for your dineros would be ""TheNotebook"" or wait for ""Sideways"" to come out. The latteris excellent."
2,This is not Vanity Fair,"Reese Witherspoon is adorable but she's not Becky Sharp. Becky, as anyone who read the book, saw the original movie or watched the BBC production knows was a powerful character. This woman was completely selfish a terrible wife and a worse mother a greedy, grasping monster and yet she was also so fascinating. This was a character you loved to hate. Reese Witherspoon plays Becky as a spirited waif.By changing Becky's character and her motives the film guts the heart of the story and without that what's the point?"
3,ALMOST...BUT NOT QUITE.,"I agree with most of the other reviews (well expressed). One point was not touched on and that was: the background music was in the foreground and the script was in the background. I.E., the performances were muted for the most part..so there was NO verbal ""punch"", making enjoying the story/cinematography/acting hard to get into. ""If"" they were delivering their lines, ""we"" couldn't receive them. I fault the director/producer/editor for all flaws - certainly not the actors."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"The sets and costumes are gorgeous; however, I wish more time had been taken on the screenplay, and/or editing. I, like some other reviewers, was a bit confused by the startling transitions - there didn't seem to be a flow or reason to them at all. I'm wondering if they cut out what might have been explanatory scenes, in the essence of time. Still, the movie clocked in at almost 2 1/2 hours!!So I guess the transitions were my biggest problem, and left me and my boyfriend wondering what in the world was going on. Also, it seemed everyone in the movie aged except for Becky Sharp. Maybe it was a nod to her youthful and witty nature, but come on - a little realism would be nice!Bottom line - if you've read the book, see it (it might be similar). If you haven't, and you're looking for a movie that's beautiful to watch, check it out. If you're looking for a great storyline - skip it. Rent ""Sense and Sensibility"" instead."
4,a nicer becky sharp,"Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job and for the most part this adaptation follows the book, however I found her portrayal to be a lot less manipulative and selfish than the Becky Sharp in the book. I still recommend this and think actor James Purefoy should become a huge star soon as well as the actress playing Amelia."
1,very poorly made junk,"I orderd this watch box hoping that it was as nice as it was stated on your website but when I received it I was very dissapointed. I needed to give it as a gift and was extremely embaresed and dissapointed. I question if I will ever trust this company again, amazon needs to make sure the quality of there products are as stated."
4,It was pretty good,"This was a really good historical fiction! The plot was good and the characters interesting, though a little bit predictable. But all in all, it is a worth while book to read."
3,"You Can't Scare Me, but You Made Me Chuckle a Bit","This story chronicles the attempts of a group of jealous kids to scare the class queen, Courtney. While not very suspenseful or teeming with action, this is a quaint fun little read. How these books were ever in danger of being banned for being frightening is beyond me. A non-Goosebumps-inducing story with humor and feeling and monsters that only appear until the last second. One of the essential, less ""out-there"" titles of the infamous series."
2,not very good,When I first checked this book out from the library I thought it would be great because it sounded exciting but it was very boring. I was expecting it to be a whole lot scarier. This book is about a group of kids who don't like this girl named courtney because she's a showoff and she thinks shes all that.Throughout the book the kids come up with ways to try to scare courtney. This book would have been a lot scarier if they talked about the mud monsters more and had more scary things happen. When the book actually reached the scary part it didn't last real long.This book was dissapointing and not the best book in the series.
2,False Advertising,"I always felt this book wasn't that great. From the cover you expect the story to focus on those cool mud monsters, but they only appear in the last few chapters. In the meantime there's just a lot of silly antics as the kids come up with various scare tactics that all fail.Maybe if they'd drawn a different cover I'd like this story more, but I just found most of the book wasted while I waited for the mud monsters to appear."
3,Q & A,"this movie starts off in the first hour really strong, then the second hour came by and i lost track on what was going on, nolte is awesome in the movie though and the main reason to check this out, the music in this movie is really cheesy"
1,Really Disappointed!,"I purchased this CD for my husband for his birthday. I ordered it, received it, and put the movie into our DVD player, and found out that the movie could not be read by my DVD player. That ment that the movie was reproduced in another country and could not be seen on our DVD player here in America. I, inturn sent the movie back to the seller, and have not heard anything since, except that my refund was applied back to my card. I thought that at least another CD would have been sent. I will not order again!"
4,Better suspense film,"Nick Nolte's performance is outstanding and very, very interesting plot. Thoroughly enjoyable film all suspense story lovers would enjoy. Highly recommend."
4,"Cant beat it for ""on the road"" convienience.","Have used this product for years on a few different models of Nikons. Being on the road for extended periods of time without a real good access to power, aa batteries do save the day!"
4,Toddler Airplane Lover Likes This Book,"I purchased this book for an 18 month old toddler who is an avid ""reader"" and LOVES planes. We enjoy looking at the busy pages and picking out different vehicles and colors. Best part is it is a board book, so my son doesn't have to be delicate with the pages. But it's not a simple baby board book with just one word or picture on each page. We are a fan!"
3,Nothing exciting,"I wasn't overly impressed with this book. It's just OK. My 4 year olds like it, but it's really more like a book for 2 year olds. I was looking for books to help my kids with their first airplane ride. The other book I bought was awesome...this book wasn't too helpful."
4,"I was iffy when i bought it, but...","I have read all of the wheel of time books, and RJ places second on my favorite authors list. I had no idea that he even wrote these Fallon books until I happened upon this one. I must say that I have never even had a slight interest in historical fiction, or what actually happened to gain us our independance, but after reading this book I found that it is quite fasinating. This book really helped expand my interests to more than just fantasy novels. I would never have opened it if had not had RJ's name on it."
3,The elements that make Jordan great are often missing in this book,"I love the Wheel of Time and I love historical fiction. I thought this book must be made for me then! However, this book was a bit of a disappointment to me. The female characters lack identity much like they do in the WoT series and seem very stereotyped (for a woman to be important she must be hot). The other characters are weakly drawn and rarely fleshed out enough to care about. The plot and timeline proceed in a fashion that is undesireable and disjointed to me. Plus the romantic elements seemed unrealistic and gratuitous.Despite these things the book was interesting and revealing. The main character is a mans man and playing a sort of a Conan the Barbarian in revolutionary times. So the book entertained me, but I do not plan on continuing the series."
2,"Weak characters and dissapointing book, from a great author.","After reading the Eye of the World series and most of Jordans Conan stories, I expected something of that calibre from this author. Nothing of the kind was forth coming. The Fallon books are filled with characters who have only one facet to their characters, meaning you can easily predict what they are going to do. Don't waste your money on this rubbish, save it for the next installment of the Eye of the World series"
4,The American Revolution from the southern point of view.,"""The Fallon Blood"" is a fast paced look at the American Revolution as seen from a southern standpoint. The characters are brought to life through a well written story that will have you begging to turn the page. This an outstanding look at some of the major events of the revolutionary period from a view that few Americans get. The book is very well researched so that the historical action rings true. ""The Fallon Blood"" is also a love story, one that is very romantic as well as heartbreaking. Whether it is the fortunes of business, love or war you seek ""The Fallon Blood"" has it all"
1,What was he thinking?,"I have very little to say about this book. I only got a quarter of the way through it, before I threw it in the trash. Very disapointing comeing from a writeing ICON like Robert Jordan. More than likely this book was released as filler between Lord of Chaos and Crown of Swords much like this books sequel Fallon Pride is filler between Crown of Swords and Path of Daggers Mr. Jordan needs to put Reagan O'neals writeing to rest"
2,Round 2,"This skin was all in all better than the last shin I had purchased, but it still is laden with alot of problems, the buttons are nice but its just not durable at all and offers little if any real protection. I gave this skin the mile and half run test and found that it was already starting to tear. So that ended my dreams of using one media player for everything. Now I invested in a second smaller player to run with and this is for travel. But I digress, this skin has a nice feel to it but dont use it for anything more than scratch prtection."
5,fleshed-out....,Loved the Stoker's two-dozen spectacular line drawings and some interesting background on Bram and the legends of his subject!
1,This is not Peter Frampton!!!,Don't buy this CD. The vocalist is a woman and not Frampton. And I don't know if he is the guitarrist of this terrible band with a bad sound quality.
2,Peter Frampton - 'Pacific Freight' (Hitbox),"Whew! I nearly spent like $12 on this title when I first saw it on Ebay, as I assumed it was a mid-'70's Frampton bootleg or maybe an archive Peter Frampton release. As it turns out 'Pacific Freight' is NOT a Frampton release at all. Very mis-guiding CD cover and title. 'Pacific Freight' is actually a recording session by Nanette Workman (actress, singer, songwriter). My guess is that Peter Frampton was merely Wokman's guitarist during this session. Only Frampton song here is obviously ""All I Want To Be Is My Side"". Hence the super-low asking price. Translation: not very many patrons [except] completists and extreme die-hard fans would likely be interested in this title."
5,Transparent Heart - Two Tons of Steel,"Two Tons of Steel comes through with a wonderful set of music, as always. It's all so good, I can't even pick out a favorite cut."
2,ehh...skip it.,"Reads a bit rough, nothing to write home about. Very dated now, and reads sorta paranoid to boot."
1,Ruthless Nonsense,"Frankly, isn't it about time someone said something bad about Neil Gaiman? A barrage of 10's isn't signal, it becomes only noise. So...The whole book seemed to start out in an orderly fashion, but then it got more and more confusing near the end. And what does that title mean, anyway"
1,"Pretention, Anyone?","I read this graphic novel and saw the play and met Neil Gaiman, all in the same day. The reason Stephen King admires this guy is because he is able to create the illusion to his audience that they are perhaps profound, or well-read somehow. Not the case. This one will leave you cold, no matter how many times you ""read"" it/look at the little pictures. Oh and girls-- Neil Gaiman's voice sounds exactly like Richard Dreyfuss."
5,"Stark and unsettling, but beautifully done.","This is early work for both Gaiman and McKean, but it's as good as anything else I've seen them do. The text and art combine seamlessly to illustrate the theme - meaningful signal, contrasted with meaningless noise - in the story of a film director dying. Although it has no supernatural elements at all, in some ways this story comes across as an earlier and starker version of 'The Sound Of Her Wings'."
2,Beautilfully drawn limited quality of writing.,I had known of this book for a long time. It is a sweet book that may not be technically correct about penguins but it is so sweet it is irrestible. I love the pictures.
4,I LOVE THIS!!!,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd, with the exception that they seem to have made it for t.v. as they have some ""pauses"" which are not too long. I guess they are more annoying than anything, cause they really don't interfere with the actual workout."
3,Not exactly Miles Davis,"If you are really good at improv and can listen to the original performers you might come out with some good stuff. I was able to use only ""Cast Your Fate to the Wind"" and ""Stella by Starlight""; ""Take Five"" didn't have anything that the standard version doesn't (except fewer flats). Overall disappointing."
3,Not what it used to be,I have ordered this brand several times and have been satisfied with it. But the last tub I ordered was a really fine( salt like )powder and would not dissolve at all. It just goes right to bottom. I noticed it being different when I opened it up. I dont know if it was a bad batch or something.
1,Stunk,Tried the workout...never felt so burntout in my life....try his big beyond belief book...much better In my Opinion
4,A book for grown ups...,"This is a great book. It's well printed, hard back case bound and is full of great graphics and explanations of the science behind just about everything mechanical we find in our daily lives.I bought this on Amazon and as with that process sometimes you don't quite know what you're getting. I bought it thinking it was a book for kids. It's not. However, it is a book that can be used WITH your kid(s) to show them and you how things work. Hence the name of the book.Great book."
3,History interesting but grammatical errors distract,"This is an interesting piece of history of Juana the Mad, the 16th century Spanish royal, who, framed by this author, was not insane but a 21st-century-minded woman woefully misunderstood. Though the plot framing device was both rickety and predictable, this book needed an editor to expunge the many, many grammatical errors . One or two is understandable, but this book's errors just about Drove Me Mad!"
1,Mediocre at best,"This book started out with great promise. The story of Juana was interesting and well-crafted, but the subplot with The obsessed Manuel and his ""victim"" Lucia is boring and weird at best, offensive and bizarre at worst. There was no need to even include them in the story. They were only interesting at the end, and that turned out to be a huge disappointment too. The end was chopped off, left you hanging. It was as if the author just gave up and decided to end it right there. Extremely unsatisfying! Also the grammar was horrendous!! Would never recommend this book to anyone"
2,Ferdinand & Isabella Offspring,"This book would have been better if the story line stuck to Philippe The Handsome and Juana The Mad's love story. The secondary lust story between a naive, convent-bred, swoony teen-ager and an older man in mid-life crisis is unnecessary and boring."
3,"Juana of Castille, mad or misunderstood?","The Scroll of Seduction does a nice job of offering possible interpretations as to the alleged madness of Juana of Castille. The actual history of the book was interesting and educational. The sub-theme of the story, the modern ""romance"" between a young boarding school student and a descendant of the Denia family, was distracting, odd and unnecessary...until the very last chapter. Only then, did the modern day characters become exciting...just as the story ended! UGH! Anyhoo, I decided to keep the book in my library as a reference but will not be recommending it to anyone not highly fascinated by historical fiction."
4,The book is concise and informative,Wilson's book is a very solid foundation for begining political science clases. It delivers the information in a to the point way that is easy to understand. The charts and graphs barely reach the '90's and need to be updated. The headlines are very useful when skiming and reviewing. The end of the chapter summaries and bold typed vocabulary words are very convieninet for studying. . .A well written book that shows all sides of controversial issues!
5,Worth the seeking out,"I bought this single about a year ago since I ended up hearing ""Tightrope"" on the local college radio and I couldn't get enough of listening to this single. Everyone is Europe has probably heard of ""In Your Eyes"" with it's disco leanings and it works fine and it is sexy & instantly catchy. ""Tightrope"" is a song that was recorded during the ""Fever"" sessions and with it's mid-tempo driving beat, it shows a lighter side to the sessions and would of been an excellent song to have made the final cut for the album. The final track on the single, ""Good Like That"" which was also not included on the album is upbeat and it's very catchy. This is Kylie at her best, this single is worth seeking out."
5,This will get you talking!,"This is the program to buy. If I were to start over again on learing Italian, I would purchase Ultimate Italian for the understanding of the language and Pimsleur for the verbal skills. I spent 9 months in lessons and was unable to engage in conversations. It wasn't until the I went through the Pimsleur programs (I'm currently on the III level), that I felt comfortable enough to go to the local conversation group in town.Level I gets you started by going very slowly and methodically. The first few tape take you syllable by syllable. As I progressed I felt confident that I had gained a solid foundation before advancing.This program can be used on it's own, but the benefits increase dramatically when supplemented by more traditional materials (such as Ultimate Italian). The book learning helps to better understand the conjugations in Pimsleur, while Pimsleur makes the it possible to speak in logical sentences."

2,A truly terrible effort from a usually great author.,"Having read the ""Lord"" books by Ms Jeffries, I did not hesitate to purchase this. Unfortunatly I was very disappointed, this was the first time I have ever had to struggle with finishing a romance novel. The main problem for me was the fact that I could not stand the main female character ""Rosalind"". She was a total unlikable character. The only thing that was not unbareble about her is that she physically was not the usual ""perfect"" woman usually depicted in romance novels. The fact that the lead female was so distasteful, and the totally generic male character ""Griff"", not to mention the ridiculous storyline, I gave it 2 stars. Only because I truly enjoyed the ""Lord"" series I will try anything else by Sabrina Jeffries."
3,Huge Disappointment!,"I loved her two other books, Forbidden Lord and Dangerous Lord. I actually couldn't put them down. Sabrina Jeffries is one of my favorite authors, but I did not like this book. I almost put it down without finishing it. I thought it was boring, not entertaining at all. The other thing . . . it was great/different that the heroine was overweight/curvy, but on the back cover/picture . . . she is not at all overweight . . . that bothered me from the start . . ."
3,its ok,"not a bad read but nothing much to it we have a hero who sees heroine and decide from that moment to be in constant arousal about her!the is no reason why he sees her and decided he wants her end of and cant control himself being physically aroused all the time!!! the only reason i did not give it one star is because i like the fact that the lead hero acts on his emotions and does not play prim and proper as does the heroine that made it for a light sex romp if your looking for more though you will not get it in this book !!!i am fascinated to read helen's story though ,Griffs man of business sounds quite yummy!!!??"
1,So very disappointed.,"I have read novels where the heroine was unlikeable, but I just didn't not like her, I hated her! Her annoying self-righteous attitude ruined the whole book. I don't know if I can bring myself to read the rest of the series."
2,Unlikeable Heroine,"Echoing the reviews of other readers, I could not get myself to finish this book because the heroine was so unlikeable. I think the author was trying to make her out to be a very strong female character with her ""Amazon"" body but she turned out to just be plain annoying. And somehow, the hero finds her annoying personality intriguing, along with her ""Amazon"" body...The addition of making the main characters quote Shakespeare to each other in every other chapter was also extremely cheesy..."
1,Annoying characters,This book is a wasting time to read. I actually ended up hurling the book to the wall. The heroine is so annoying and unattractive and the hero is kinda dumb to me. I don't think I would ever recommend this book to anyone. A huge disappointment
1,Contrived and irritating,"The plot was too contrived and seemed like she was trying to copy a Shakespeare comedy but failed. Too much sex, too little plot. If this was the first Jeffies book I had read I would probably never choose one again. That said, after looking at some of the ones I did read, I think she is a weak writer in general."
2,Unlikeable heroine,"A Dangerous Love was not an enjoyable read for me. I won't go into the plot, as I'm sure others have already done so. However, I must say I've discovered I'm not a fan of light historicals (Sabrina Quinn writes more in the style of Julia Quinn and Karen Hawkins). In addition, the heroine played havoc with my nerves. She argued with the hero all through the book to the point where I just wished someone would rescue him from her. Was she meant to be like Kate from The Taming of the Shrew, as she is a Shakespeare quoting heroine? If you like lighter, more humourous historical romance, The Pirate Lord by the same author was a much better read."
4,A wonderfully crafted tale,"I truly enjoyed this book. The heroine was a real woman -- strong and round and not always perfect. But it was the hero who really made this book for me. Ms Jeffries made him believe so deeply in his own actions, even though they were wrong, that I couldn't help but feel for him. He was far from perfect, and even though I waited for him to realize just *how* wrong he'd been, I desperately wanted to see him chase his happily ever after! I cannot wait for Sabrina Jeffries' next book!"
1,"so where's the ""oracle"" part?","Ok, I got the book, but where's the statue and the oracle sticks?What a rip off!"
2,Too incomplete.,"Unfortunately, this book is more of an overview book. Don't expect to get any of the subjects presented fully explained. Some of the really important topics (like hazard detection) are only briefly mentioned. For the price it should have been at least twice as big and much more detailed."
5,John Barry's music is so lovely,"I was so happy to get this collection of John Barry's music. Down through the years, I have collected some his stuff. He is one of my favorite, maybe my favorite, movie music composers."
3,"Great music, unimpressively played.","First, the good points.John Barry's amazing music - which is hard to mess up.The music choices are excellent - rather than the obvious main themes, sometimes the far more expressive and moving minor moments from soundtracks are chosen, giving the collection more of a sense of continuity and making it very moving.But there are bad points too.Sadly - this orchestra are not up to playing the music very well. It often sounds like they are just reading the music and rehearsing, rather than really feeling it and blending instruments like on the originals. It feels a little cheaply-made and amateur in places - although it does improve as the CDs move towards Barry's later work.Overall, I am sad to say that I think this collection does a disservice to Barry's amazing work, by making it sound plodding and pedestrian in places, when the originals were anything but."
3,Oldies better than new DVD,"I have several Tony Little VHS tapes, really liked his manner but new DVD is too ""energetic"" and not for the older folks. Liked his older ones much better. Warm up tires me out!!"
1,The Gate,Riddiculous crap! - Don't waste your time. Third rate 70's special effects (smh). Intolerable for 21st century viewers. Kids are very cute though....LoL
5,Better 20 years later,This movie will bring back memories of when you watched it in the 80's so I highly recommend it. The stop-mation is so awful but you already knew that. This was way before CGI so ya godda go with it. The parents are away and the kids have free roam of the house and the movie reminds us of that freedom and childhood innocence we once enjoyed.
1,"Never liked Stephen Dorff, who would have known that he was more insufferable as a child.",Bad special effects with even worse acting make this a must see if you are a fan of s*** movies. Must own classic that goes even better with a few Rob Roy cocktails.
5,One of my faves!!!,"If you had HBO in the 1980's, it's alsmost assured that you saw the movie the Gate. I was always excited to see it as a kid, and was pretty happy to find it on DVD. The DVD isn't the best quality, but I didn't expect some 2 disc ultra-edition for an 80's cult classic. I would have bought it, but I'm not sure people seeing it for the first time would take such a chance. There are so many memorable parts in this movie, it's hard to pick out the key scenes. I love the opening, vey eerie, and you're never sure whether it was a dream, real, or somewhere in between. The whole party scene, when Terry falls down the hole, and when the zombie breaks through and carries away his best friend and sister. Oh, and who can forget the rock record taht tells how to close the gate when it's played backward. Oh, sweet memories...."
3,Cheesy but classic,"If you grew up in the 80's, you'll probably remember seeing this at some point on basic television. It is a super cheesy horror flick with little demons that take over a young Stephen Dorf's home. It is terrible but I love it. And I so want a muzzled demon for a pet. They're kinda cute."
3,This DVD is at Best Buy - Sep.15 2003 (...),"No wide-screen and no frills, but it's there.As for the movie, an 80's-rainy-day B-flavor child/fantasy/adventure/horror flick with some good special effects and a decent story for its time. Alot like ""Demons"" or any 80's horror/fantasy, but with a special panache because of the exceptional stop-action mini-monsters.Watching it again after so many years was a bit of a disappointment. One could get away with starting the movie in the middle and missing nothing but cheesy 80's intro's to characters. For some reason though, I loved it in the 80's, so it was nice to see again and the monsters didn't disappoint. They are the creepiest of any horror movie."
2,Oh...You Best Suspend Your Disbelief.,"Viewed: 3/12Rate: 33/12: Oy vey! Talk about dumb. The Gate certainly has it all. Mmkay...Glen randomly decides to launch a mini rocket inside of his home to save the world? I don't know where he got the concept from, and I don't know how it all ties into together. I felt the demon were too far lenient with the kids, and if there were demons around the house, the best course of action might be...get out of the house and go to another place? What a stupid film The Gate is. Speaking of annoyance, how about these female kids? Yeah..that was bad enough. How did they all survive the Gate? Stupid film. The very slow build up didn't help it either. All in all, avoid The Gate like the plague."
1,don't buy it!,"This movie is poorly acted, directed, and written. My 8 year old got so bored with this movies' nonsense that he went to his pick-up sticks for entertainment. The special effects are poor and the storyline is lame."
1,only avail in USA?,"Only available in US? WTF this is a Canadian movie, how does that even happen, and more importaintly, WHY? Hello AMAZON this is the INTERNET and its WORLDWIDE. enough said..... they'll never get it."
3,"Good cheap thrills, especially for younger viewers","Like so many products of the 80's, The Gate succeeds more on nostalgia than actual entertainment value. But that's not to say it isn't worth watching. In fact, it's probably one of the best films of its kind: Low-budget, mid-to-late 80's PG-13 horror with a then-unknown cast, and a generous amount of special effects.What also strikes me about it, years later, is that the story itself more resembles an old-fashioned monster movie than a teen horror flick. I still get a kick out of watching the basic plot (kids inadvertently unlock a gateway to another dimension, unleashing demonic critters) tick by like clockwork. And it's all fairly inoffensive, though there are still a handful of decent scares.Even without the nostalgia factor, I think this is a fine kid's horror film. Great for a Saturday matinee or a Halloween marathon paired with TREMORS or Fred Dekker's THE MONSTER SQUAD (for which a DVD release is long overdue)."
3,I remember this movie,"I remember seeing this movie when I was younger, and it was pretty good. I just found the DVD at a low price and could not resist buying it. A little hokey, but worth adding to your horror collection. Here is a description from the back of the box: When best friends Glen and Terry stumble across a mysterious crystalline rock in Glen's backyard, they quickly dig up the newly sodden lawn searching for more precious stones. Instead, they unearth The Gate - an underground chamber of terrifying demonic evil."
4,"COOL, GOOSEBUMPS STYLE HORROR FLICK.",THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE MANY GREAT EIGHTIES HORROR MOVIES. THE CLASSIC CHEESE WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH WHILE SCARING YOU. OU WONT BE SORRY.
3,"Nice Movie, but they can do way better...","The Gate is where some superstitious kids (or you'd think they were) dig up this gate, but really it was caused by a thunderstorm, then a tree fell down and made the gate open. Even though this may be scary with monsters like the piggy guys, the Demon King, and so on, this movie can turn out to be weird and maybe one of the bad ones. I hope The Gate II is better, although probably not..."
4,Nightmares for years as a kid,"I have yet to see this movie as an adult, but i remember being aroung the age of 8 and being allowed to watch this by an uncle of mind babysitting one night, and i about wet myself. Nightmares were a regular occurance after that night. I'm sure as an adult that ill wonder what i was thinking back then, but if you are looking for a movie with effects before its time, this is the one. Great film."
3,this is a pretty good movie,"this movie is ok. (ive seen better) it is about 6-8 teens who throw a party in an old house that is possesed. and there is a gatew in the front of the house where once you pass it you are traped inside. if you like 80""s type horror flicks this is actually one of the better ones. [....]"
1,Hokey,"I was really disapointed with this book, as 80% of it lacks any sort of usable information. You get the feeling that they were just going through the motions when they put this book together and therefore created a compilaton of the absurd. ""How to avoid a Vampire attack"" is actually one of the topics of survival. That's just great guys. I wish I'd never wasted my money on this thing."
5,Couldn't catch my breath,"The word pictures in A Parchment of Leaves drew me into the story so deeply I could barely breathe. Through the transitions of time and place I became a part of Vine, sharing her life, wanting to be with her. Redbud Camp and God's Creek became my world. I know these people through the heart of Silas House."
5,Cherokee Roots,"Having searched for my own Cherokee roots, I could easily relate to the feelings, language and culture of the native people and the mountains. The activities,language and thinking are authentic for that place and time. There are tales of spousal abuse in my own family, and of drinking. This is one book I'll never forget, neither it nor its powerful message."
2,Disappointing,"Wanting some more Appalachian lore, this book was suggested based on another author/book that I read from a similar genre. What a slow read."
5,Read this book!,"""A Parchment of Leaves"" was highly recommended to me, and I now highly recommend to all that want a brilliantly written, poetic, and moving story about love, life, and family. It is a beautiful story and one of the best books I've read in my life. It had me mezmerized and drawn in. The characters are all so amazingly real.Tough yet tender Vine, of Cherokee descent, is the main character who we want to get to know, and we do as the story progresses. Thought to be a ""witchy woman"" by the townsfolk, she is soon discovered by Saul Sullivan. They fall in love. Vine is one of the best characters written in the English language. She springs to life so vividly, and you want to see good things happen to her throughout her life at ""God's Creek"" with Saul, once the get married and settle down.You have to read this masterpiece to find out for yourself.Thank you, Silas House! You are a literary genuis!Keep reading, Eileen"
5,an excellent book,This book is wonderfully written and hard to put down. The characters lives intertwine in such a way that the reader keeps wondering what will happen next. Mr. House is an excellent author and I look forward to reading more of his books. You will not be disappointed in reading this book.
1,As Bad As The Others,This book doesn't deserve any recognition as a piece of literature. So boring I'm sure there would be more useful purposes for the paper it was written on.[...]
4,Too quick to flesh out this idea,"Again one of JAK's efforts suffers from the mini-book size. This is super premise. Justin Drake has targeted Cassie Bond's little sister to be his wife. But Cassie draws the line in the sand. He is too old and a former casino owners with a questionable past. NOT what her perfect princess of a sister needs as a husband. So she corners him and blackmails him into leaving her sister alone.But one does not snatch the prey away from a preditor without a few scratches, and drawing the interest of the preditor to you. Which is the situation Cassie suddenly finds herself in. Great premise, as Justin suddenly turns his attention to her, but it is rush rush rush from there. Justin's macho tendencies play a little heavy, somewhat dating the book. The mystery tossed in about the house she rents really seems more a divice than a true part of the story.But even a poor JAK is a good read, and at this promo price is it a good way to spend an evening."
3,Darker Shadings Than Usual,"Nightwalker's main characters, Cassie and Justin, are initially in conflict over Justin's interest in Cassie's wealthy, younger sister. Of course soon Justin shifts his attention to Cassie.Justin is darker than most of Ms. Krentz's heroes. In fact, some readers may find Justin's behavior a little too close to stalking and one scene verges on attempted rape. Cassie is a quirky heroine, but she is strong enough to deal with most of Justin's outrageous actions.Overall the storyline is interesting but if you enjoy Ms Krentz's lighter fare you may find some elements of this story troubling."
2,Too cheesy for me,Cassie Bond wants Justin Drake out of her sister's life. After all he is a fortune hunter. When she blackmails him he is after revenge. he follows her to her vacation retreat and stays at her home. he vows he will seduce her. Well.....that was the best part of the book. After it becomes a big yawn. Too predictable. The characters are too weak and immediately takes away the premise of a creature of the night. Which I in turn would have liked him to be a real vampire. Oh well...
2,Misleading,"Hi everyone, I am 15 ..my mother said since I read the book I could review it. I love paranormal books so when I read the back cover of this book and it said ""He was a creature of the night"" I got it. Problem is this was misleading because the main male character is not a vampire at all. Just someone who use to be involved with alot of night life. The book to me seemed like one long drawn out conversation. And I can't understand why the lead male liked the lead female."
3,Nightwalker doesn't hold up...,"I didn't feel this book held up to the test of time. I have a feeling that if I had read it back when it was originally published I would have loved it. However the man's point of view in this story was a bit over the top for this day and age. Although I feel the theme of romance is time-less, the dialogue in the book is not. Read with that in mind, there is still enough about the book to enjoy."
4,reread,Full Blast has Jamie and Max tracking a serial killer who is finding their victijms in Jamies personal section in the paper. Along the way Jamie hires a physic to work at the paper. This book has a lot more steam than the others.
3,"A page turner, but not overly captivating","It was certainly a page turner, I didn't want to put the book down - a compliment to the writers! However, I still felt a little disappointed. I felt Jamie's character was just a tad weak, they could have been built her up more. I couldn't get a clear picture of her in my head, that said - I have not read any other books in the series. Full Blast is too strong of a title, I kept on waiting to be swept away and the book to really take off (more fast paced) but it never happened. Entertaining, but hopefully future books will be stronger."
1,"""Eeyeuuw""","I can hardly believe that Janet Evanovich wrote this book or contributed to it in any way. I have read all of her Plum books and laughed out loud, I felt this was very poorly written and draggy. Won't read another one of these."
3,"Entertaining, but not my favorite...","Although the plot is somewhat predictable, and certainly not very believable... (why are two city folk solving a murder instead of the police) the story still entertains. It is always fun to follow Evanovich's characters (this time with the obvious assistance of Charlotte Hughes) through their hairbrained trials and tribulations. I listened to this book on CD and thoroughly enjoyed the author interview at the end.If you are looking for another great, quick read I recommend ""The Time Keeper"" by Kevin Cropp. Although not as light-hearted as ""Full Blast"" it is still a gratifying, recommended read."
4,Turn up the heat & slip into something comfortable...,"This description caught my eye yesterday while I was browsing for something to read while enjoying the day at the swimming pool. I could NOT put this book down until it was finished last night.All the characters in Full Blast are FUN! Destiny Moultrie blows into this small South Carolina town and you can bet that things will never be the same again. See...she's a psychic, who is followed by Ronnie, a spirit trapped between worlds. Eyebrows are raised when Destiny carries on conversations with Ronnie and will have you laughing. Everyone is skeptical at first when she tells of ""visions"" that women will die, but her visions come to life and it's up to Destiny, Jamie and Max to find the killer before he strikes again.Full Blast is a perfect combination of comedy, mystery and steam! Once you start reading, you won't be able to stop."
1,Pathetic,"How this got published is beyond me! I didn't find it even mildly interesting. The writing is beyond belief. A sample : ""An old four-poster rice bed and matching high-boy, both in cherry greeted them"". The bed and the high-boy were definitely more interesting than the other characters! Sorry, even one star rating is overly generous."
1,Janet -- what have you done?,"It's hard for me to believe that Janet had anything to do with this, other than her name. This is REALLY bad writing -- nothing like the Plum series. Janet did Charlotte Hughes a big favor by lending her name to it -- that's what I think. The dialogue is very contrived -- a whole different style from the great dialogue in the Plum series. I read the whole book, hoping it'd get better. It never did."
1,DId not buy this book,Not one of the three Evanovich books was purchased by me. I like her books but have not bought recently.
1,not Evanovich's best....,"I thoroughly disliked the character DeeDee in the first novel, and she makes her comeback in this one.Tell me, how does a woman go from premenopausal to pregnant??Also, if I have to read "" Eeyeuuw"" again, I am throwing this book away."
5,Full Blast,I love this series it had some mystery and humor. I would be reading and start laughing . I have read almost all of Janet Evanovich books and this whole series with Charlotte Hughes. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a light easy read.
1,No development of characters at all,"I must say I was very disappointed in this book. While parts of it were well written and witty, the authors never took time to develop the characters. Every other page you turn you ask why is he or she saying that, why are they doing this. The whole book was just too disjointed and not very well organized."
1,Disappointing effort from Evanovich,"This book managed to surpass the low quality of all the other 'full-' books after the first one. They've been steadily declining in quality, but this one was a significant step down.I hope Janet sticks to Stephanie Plum in the future."
3,Average,"Full Blast is a repeat of the Stephanie Plum series, just different names. It seems as though all Evanovich's novels are pretty much the same. Turn up the heat? All I got out of it was a simmer. I've read much better."
5,A Series Hitting Its Stride,"The Full series has been gradually improving since Full House, and it has really hit its stride with this edition. Full Blast is a fun, light book, which I really enjoyed reading. This is by far the best book of the series."
4,Scary,"I remember watching this movie a long time ago in the theater. The special effects were not the best I have ever seen, but it had an eerie feeling to it. Good performance by Richard Burton. The description in Amazon says that the protagonist has the ability to come up with thoughts and make them come true, but as far as I remember Burton's character is able to ""prophesy"" when something bad is going to happen, rather than cause bad things to happen."
1,The Medusa Touch,I did not know that region 2 mean that I cannot view this in the USA. I bought a dvd that I cannot watch.I wish I could return it and get my money back.
5,"Burton is a brooding ,sensual anti-hero for the masses.","This is the film that got me interested in Burton. I first saw it on British television many years ago,and Burtons portrayal of an intelligent, but massively tortured man is reminiscent of his own life.He had a ""gift"" which would ultimately tear him apart.This film is not currently available on video in the UK.That is a disgrace."
3,A little odd.,"It reminds me of a Steven King novel. Interesting idea concerning the power of telekinesis and beyond, but not so well developed as it might have been . . . or particularly believable."
4,WORTH IT!,"This is an honest product-by that I mean tech quality is very good but most importantly a very honest/heartfelt performer. An excellent window into another time period and ""culture""."
5,great service,"shipped in a reasonable amount of time, good communication, great product! I would buy from again."
2,Camera Battery,Don't buy. Over priced and am not sure it is genuine Nikon. It certainly doesn't last nearly as long as the one comes with the camera or the ones I bought from NWV Direct at half the the price.
3,Not to honest,"I got my Lithium lon Battery Pack in almost two week as they told me. Some how the address on envelope had my zip code blacken out as was my lab address. The picture on Amazon showed a Nikon Battery with the name on it.But the one I received do not have Nikon any were on it, and upon turning it over it said make in China. Japan is not in China to my knowledge China doesn't make Nikon product. This is not my first Nikon product!I will have to test this to see if it really works, if you are not selling Nikon just say it's a copy. Yes, the price should have told me something but they showed a Nikon product,yet they sold me something make in China not to honest in my book.!"
3,aligboratbruno,"I just saw a promo for ""Bruno"" (the movie) a month ago and thought I'd check out some of his early stuff. BTW - Bruno was my favorite and I'm looking forward to the movie in mid July 2009. I've never seen ""Borat"" and never will now after seeing this DVD set. The best thing about Ali G was the opening sequence of each episode - the suit up. The whip snapping sound of the waist band on his Tommy H shorts was priceless. Still cracks me up.Quote from another reviewer:""You end up feeling sorry for the people he interviews instead of laughing at them, and at the same time respecting them for tolerating Mr. Cohen..."" That about sums it ALL up. One segment (repeated twice during the seasons) comes to mind is when Borat has a room full of people stand up and have 10 minutes of silence (for whatever). If someone made a noise he would start the 10 minutes over. Stupid and cruel.3 out of 5I'm still looking forward to ""Bruno"" the movie."
5,Ali G show is the best for laughs,"This series is just hilarious - If I ever am in need of a laugh, I know that these are the DVDs to go to. There is nothing on TV now that makes me laugh this hard! It's great to see some of the earlier appearances of Borat, and Ali G is such a great platform for awkward interviews. Love it!!"
5,loved it,i was told about the series from my boyfriend and as soon as i got it in the mail i opened it and watched the whole series and it was awesome!
3,Axis And Allies,The game is Great!!! but..... after ordering this product online for a decent price I had to pay $40.00 duty when it arrived...there was NO indication that the extra charge would be made and therefore the board game cost almost $90 which is unreasonable for a boardgame...buyer beware!
1,boombox?,"This product turned out to be nothing like the advertized ""boombox."" A boombox is defined in the dictionary as a ""portable"" audio system. It was advertized as a system that could be enjoyed at tailgate parties. All this would imply having its own power supply (i.e. battery operated) and easy to carry from place to place. None of this was true. It could only be used with an AC power source and came in three unattached components that would make portability difficult. Besides those major drawbacks, the unit's housing was cheap, light duty plastic, not appropriate for outdoor parties, and it made lots of internal noise when changing CDs."
1,Deer alerts,I thought this product was going to alert me when the deer came around.Never saw one buck - zero game this year.
3,"Annoying, but worth it","As with most Disney Channel/Disney sequels, this was annoying. My children loved it though. It is not as bad as some, and probably as good as the first Twitches, as both are a little sad. However, for Halloween or good spooky/magical fun this is at least fun and safe for kids to watch."
3,purchased as a gift,I would think the kids love the dvds to watch on their personal dvd players! We haven't heard any complaints.
5,A+,"i couldnt find this move any where, but i was able to get it just in time for my daughters birthday"
1,Technical difficulties,We had problems with viewing this video. We could never reach the instructions to play and it kept getting stuck in the DVD player.
3,Cute Movie for Younger Audience,"This is a cute magical movie series. It is exactly what Disney is known for. However, as far as accuracy is concerned, anyone who is a fan of the book series by H.B. Gilmour & Randi Reisfeld will be disappointed as this is NOT the kind of Harry Potterish book-to-movie thing. Lots of details have been changed and left out completely. Maybe I would have liked it more if it had been a bigger budget film series. I can't really say I like the script on this one. The movie relies heavily on cheesy special effects. I feel that the characters have been ""dumbed down"" a lot. Yes, it's Disney, but still... children don't need to be treated like they're stupid. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen it yet. Go read the books and you'll understand my review."
3,Twitches Too,It followed on from the first one but wasn't quite their but on the whole was pretty good
3,"Inspirational, Helpful","I found this book valuable for the Author's insistence and emphasis on the basic techniques of swordplay.My only experience with swordsmanship is in the European tradition, but I found the authors drills to be helpful, in terms of illustrating the importance of timing and distance. The drills are not flashy, but were never represented as such.My experience in fencing suggests that the best and most succesful swordsmen do simple moves, very fast, very accurately, and at just the right time. I believe the drills in this book will help any swordsman develop such skills.This is not a book for someone with no experience or no teacher, but If you want to learn some valuable insights into real swordsmanship, this book will be helpful, especially at this price."
2,Low Quality of Readability,"While this book presents an average knowledge, and basic drills, it does so with hard to see images-B/W of maximum 5/8 inch tall or 1.5 cm tall. The quality of the media is very poor, they could have make full-size or half-size page images for better viewing of the gripping, sword cutting angles, etc. I cannot recommend this book, when much better quality production are available on this website. Sorry."
3,Extraordinarily average,"Despite the fact that it claims to have some advanced techniuqes this really is a very basic book of sword drills. The writing is adequate, the knowledge is for the most part correct, the pictures while small and elementary are serviceable, and the information is okay but frankly nothing in this book stands out as special at all. There are stepping/footwork drills, solo drills, and two person drills that are usable as a supplement for just about any Japanese sword art. There is nothing truly wrong with this book but in my mind it is about 100 pages of extraordinary averageness. Find it used if you want to pick up a copy.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"
2,Stays only on the basics. I didn't like it...,"This book is divided in 3 different sections (stepping drills, solo drills, two-person drills) All of them are EXTREMELY basic, accompanied by 2 dimensional drawings of the movements (that really don't say anything about the movement, and remind you of old nintendo samurai videogames -that's how the drawings look like, imagine what you can learn from them-) I really didn't like it. It's relly not usefull at all, other books on the subject have better ""drills"", with lots of other good stuff -not like this one-."
2,Not very useful,"I found the illustrations difficult to follow. Many seemed to show only the starting position and ending position of a particular action, making it hard to see exactly what was intended. There are a number of much better books, such as ""Flashing Steel""."
4,does not have Wyboo in book,Does not have Wyboo in book.Otherwise a great source of information on everthing
1,terrible percussion,this was simply the wrong music. awful sound and of course one cannot return it to amazon!what a bummer and a rip off!i am finally stopping buying a CD who's music i cannot listen to first.
5,Whooohoooo!,This is a great little product that has already saved my phone several times. I am outdoors much of the time and this does a great job protecting it. Now if they could just develop a cover for the front screen that was tougher.
5,Best translation of a simply great book,"No point in my laboring here. Having read several translations of this masterpiece, and David Magarshack's effort at least a half dozen times, the Penguin Classics is my favorite. As for the novel, well it simply annihilates the attentive reader. The most wrenching treatment of love, hate, passion to the point of self destruction, this is a terribly funny book in parts, and Magarshack captures the humor beautifully. Torrential conversations, several beautiful women, and the greatest birthday party ever committed to print, there is also a murder(of course, it's Dostoyevsky!). Hallucinogenic passages alternate with passages of great wit, generosity and unbearable truths about being human. This book is a monster and will change your life. My Old and New Testaments, in one volume, at a great price. Get it and believe!!"
2,"OK premise, bad translation","I read this book shortly after reading Crime and Punishment (which I loved), and I was sadly let down. I don't know if the translation was bad or if the actual story just didn't interest me. The ideas portrayed were somewhat broad and unfocused and I couldn't ever put my finger on what the whole thing was about. The prose was so bland that even in moments that ought to be intense, seemed just like ordinary everyday happenings. The general idea I got from the book was about a genuinely good person deemed an idiot because pure goodness is not normal in society. I never found myself caring about any particular character except Aglaya and her situation is never resolved at the end.If you do plan to read this book, I'd try a more modern translation.Darby"
4,"Decent book, good overview","I found this book very helpful. It gave a nice overview of a variety of up-to-date techniques. Seeing a number of different small and medium sized railroads built from start to finish gave me a good idea of the kinds of techniques I would like to use. With this book as a starting point, I was able to find further information in other publications more specific to my needs.The book does have some weaknesses. Being a collection of seperate articles, there was no feeling of flow even though the projects are organized roughly by size. Often particular parts of a project are only vaguely described. It is not a comprehensive guide. For instance, the use of remote switch machines is largely ignored.This book is a great starting point, and combined with more in depth information from books on specific subjects, it provides a great overview of what it takes to build a model railroad using a variety of modern techniques."
3,not worth it,"not even close to worth it, for the amount of money your spending. I would be looking elsewhere to spend my money. The only part of the book I used was one of the layouts had a fairly good bench. And you can find this same bench in the book ""From Set To Scenery"" for a whole lot less money. I spent the money & am not even close to satisfied."
5,Great chefs knife,I recently purchased this knife for my son's birthday and he loves it! I have a good quality chefs knife in this price range but this knife is far superior. It feels balanced allowing it to cut very easily and smoothly. The hollow edge keeps food from sticking for better slicing and chopping of different food types. I am planning to ask for one for myself for Christmas!
3,"ok, but too slow to start","I bought these bulbs for use in the basement. But, it takes them a few minutes to brighten fully, so going down the stairs when we first turned them on was not practical. In the end, I ended up using another compact fluorescent bulb that gets bright faster."
2,"not worth my money,,","doesnt fit most of my flashes,, actually none of them,, falls off easily, unless you want to tape it on, which is possible,"
3,Great starter pack for the undecided buyer,"I was first introduced to the Mighty Leaf Marekkesh Mint Green Tea by a co-worker and I enjoyed the taste & Aroma of the Tea. I did an online search which lead me to Amazon & the Mighty Leaf official site, which listed a variety of flavors. I decide to purchase the variety pack in order to try each type before puchasing an individual type. The variety pack is an excellent choice for those who want a different flavor every day or for those who are undecided about the taste. The price is quite reasonable for the tea."
2,don't always work,"When these work they are great. the problem is I have to keep wiggling them and repositioning them at the hole I plug them into or they won't work. They are very ""touchy""; the sound will go off or just out of one side. The problem isn't with my laptop because any other headphones I plug into it are fine."
4,received in new condition,"Ordered several of these items as gifts for friends who are into electronics/computers. Received everything I ordered online through AMAZON.COM from the Seller 365USA in excellent condition and packed very securely and showing care for efficient delivery. Received the shipment Dec. 17, 2009 via UPS so delivery was as expected, if not sooner. UPS drivers were hurried because of Christmas rush I'm sure. Items were as advertised and were in new condition still in original packaging. I would definitely recommend this item as a good BUY. Am a well-satisfied customer of AMAZON.COM at this point. Keep up the great work guys/gals. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY, PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR 2010."
1,Received Wrong Product,"I have to say that I was disappointed when I received my purchase. My intent was to purchase a microphone for my computer. And while the product description does read ""headphones"" the item pictured is a microphone. I did not actually read the written description unitl after I had ordered and received the headphones already. My assumption was that I had ordered and would receive a microphone."
4,very good tools,"My wife loves her pink tool set. Now she doen't need to use mine, and I can find my tools where I left them.,"
4,Good Tools,"I got these as a gift from my husband. These tools are sturdy and comfortable in your hand. I like that they have their own box and a place for each tool. I can tuck this set away and make sure no one uses it and loses the pieces. The pink color is nice, it makes it more appealing to me. I would buy these if I were you!"
3,For fans of CoCo or J-trash only,"J-exploitation made for the video-only market. Originally hyped as a breakout role for Mikiyo Ohno, a former member of CoCo -- a Japanese singing group whose level of suggestiveness was limited to two-piece bikinis.Ohno, 23 years old at the time of this production, did not have much of a solo career following the breakup of the group in 1994 and figured this vehicle would jumpstart a languid resume.The story is, of course, another rip-off of ""La Femme Nikita"" and the script was probably hammered out in a day. There are long moments of awkward solitude with Ohno contemplating her twisted morality in the nude -- a model assassin, indeed!The level of satisfaction with this video will probably be proportional to your devotion to 1) CoCo, or 2) Japanese trash cinema and its varied cousins."
1,Is everyone seeing the same movie I'm seeing?,"Zero woman should actually be called Zero Acting. The only way this movie can hold any man's attention is by having the "" heroine "" disrobe every five minutes. That may not be terrible but it gets old fast. She is supposedly this superagent but she is constantly captured by the enemy. She is supposed to be an expert shot but she couldn't hit the side of an elephant if it were directly in front of her. This movie is horribly acted and horribly shot. There is no saving grace here. I would give it ZERO stars if I could. Check out Tsui Hark's "" Time and Tide "" for action."
5,Best book I have ever read!,"I have worn out my copy of this book and had to replace it! It is the best feel good romance story ever written. I am a big fan of Ms. Spencer, and I rate this one as her best. I have missed her writing since she retired, but at least I can re-read her fine stories.I almost feel as though Teddy and Linnea actually existed, their story is so real. It is a feel good book-grab it and curl up in bed on a cold winter day! There is hardship, of course in the book, but not so much that your miserable just reading it. You will be touched. I have hundreds of ""keeper"" books-books that I can enjoy again and again. But this one-hands down-is the BEST."
3,Good but not great,"I thought the relationship between the characters was flat. Spencer took a lot of time developing the relationship between the two but I just didn't see a spark. Also, Spencer placed so many incidents at the end of the book the plot seemed hurried. It was a good read but not great."
1,"Not a good ""copy"", appears to be bootleg.","This book is clearly a bad bootlegged copy. I haven't read it yet, and I am planning to still, but the cover and all of the interior appear to have been ""scanned"" and printed on a poor quality printer. The cover, spine and back cover of the book have a foggy, pixelated appearance and it is clear to me it is because someone has just scanned an original. I'm not sure how Amazon would allow this, but I did not expect it from them."
5,One of the best stories I've ever read!,"""Years"" is a beautiful and touching romance novel that takes your breath away and leaves you turning the pages in anticipation. Although I'm only 15, I found this story a timeless classic that I will read over and over for a long time. The descriptions of the landscape were magnificant and seemed to put me in the story. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys romance novels with a real story involved."
4,Spencer,"I have read all of Spencer's books and wish she would start writing again. My most favorite is Morning Glory, but I have never been disappointed in any of her books."
2,Couldn't hold my attention,"I thought the writing to be as uninteresting as the characters and the plot. Simply could not finish it! I have read all her later books, finding them charming with well developed characters and tender romance. This must have been an early attempt and does not indicate the quality of her later works!"
5,At The Top Of My List,"Excellent!!! This is what I love in a book . The characters personalities run so deep . We are able to see Linnea grow from a dreamy young lady to a very capable woman . I could really relate to her . I also like the fact that the major antagonists in this book were nature (Blizzards , spanish influenza)they were very real to evey one alive at that time . A book full of great characters . I loved every page ."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","This book is not only disgustingly anti-Japanese, but completely ridiculous. The premise of the book is that Americans and Japanese can never understand or relate to one another. The Japanese (of course) start a war. It also portrays the American Navy as idiots who cannot counter an enemy attack. Our submarines accidentally get run over by oil tankers. I could not finish this book. It became totally ridiculous. Joe Weber treats his audience like we are idiots!"
5,A Classic,"This isn't a ""gay"" film, it is a film about humanity, about good and evil. All great films ultimately are this. And My Beautiful Laundrette is one of them."
4,Ambidextrous Prejudice,"This is a must-see film for anyone concerned with the plight of repressed human beings. Not only does the film expose the anti-Pakistani(dark-skinned) bigotry of the white lower-class Briton, it also expresses well the ambivalence most gay men still feel, especially in the lower economic strata of society where ""a little knowledge"" is indeed a ""dangerous thing."" However, it is also a powerful love story which surprises the audience with its youthfulness and yet its simultaneous maturity as well. Although the milieu is working-class Britain and middle-class yearning immigrants, it might just as well be filmed anywhere in similar socio-economic circumstances in the United States. The ending may be a little confusing to many, but careful attention and rewatching the film soon cures that malady."
3,my beautiful launderette,the sound was difficult especialy with the english axcent. good story.skiped around a bit but was well acted i thought. glad i saw it
5,Nikon AC digital adapter cable,"The cable works great, albeit somewhat expensive for what it is. The description doesn't indicate it works with the new D80 camera, but it does. The description also indicates that the wall to adapter cable is needed (comes with camera) but the adapter package also included this cable as a bonus! I only needed this adapter since I plan to copy a bunch of slides to my computer and didn't want to run down the battery in the camera. The adapter works, nothing more to rate."
1,eh-5 does NOT charge the camera,The web site incorrectly lists the eh-5 adapter as a charger for the D series cameras. It is NOT. It is only a power cord for the camera and NOT a charger.
1,Pricey power cable,Seems a huge amount of money for what is little more than a power cable and basic transformer. This came free with my point-and-shoot Canon G5. Why not with a more expensive DSLR?
4,Great Read,I got this book as I needed to brush up on my knowledge about semiotics for work and really enjoyed it. Very easy to digest the information and very readable.
5,Superb guide for leading wilderness activities,"This is an excellent book on what it takes to lead outdoor activities such as hikes, ski tours, backpacking trips, etc. It's really the first and best guide of its kind. Highly recommended!"
4,"Focus on the ""softer"" values in leadership","Easy reading with good point on why a leader needs to not only have a good model, but also needs to train compassion and courage when working with people.Nothing sensational but a good book if you're working with people (not only in the outdoors)..."
2,I Will Fight no More Forever,"I ordered this but it didn't come after 30 days. Checked on the website and the order looked okay but I reordered it and quickly received the copy. However, 6 weeks later I recieved a second copy. I paid for both...how many copies does one need of this movie?"
3,Read this before you decide........,"It would have been nice if Costner and G.Greene could have worked a bit of their magic on this one. For those who are unfamiliar with the Great Chief Joseph...This would be a good eye opener to that beginning of your education. The acting isn't the best...I hope this movie gets remade.....For ""We The People""."
3,Read this before you decide........,"It would have been nice if Costner and G.Greene could have worked a bit of their magic on this one. For those who are unfamiliar with the Great Chief Joseph and the plight of the Nez Perce Peoples...This would be a good eye opener to that beginning of your education. The acting isn't the best...I hope this movie gets remade.....There's a good story that needs to be told here.......For ""We The People""."
4,Good video for high school USA History class,"I am a high school teacher, ELL, and have been showing this video for the past few years as we study in our text, the NezPerce removal from their lands, by the government.My students, who are new to this country, tell me the readings in our text come to life when visualized.Yes, there are some severe scenes of violence, shootings, but this is the reality of the history.Do prepare your students first by reading about Chief Joseph and his people before viewing. I also use a story map, graphic organizer, while the students are viewing, which then we develop into a book report.I highly recommend I WILL FIGHT NO MORE FOREVER."
5,A must for everyone which are interested in history of Native Indian extermination,"Buy this movie. Its a must if you are interested in native indians in america, and the extermination of the Native Indian people.Kristian Aartun"
3,I will fight no more forever - DVD,"This was a very good depiction of the history, told from the perspective of the Native American. I was surprised to find that it was an old movie. I thought it was a new release."
3,I Will Fight No More Forever,"I was disapointed in this movie. Considering the talent of the actors, the film did not live up to what I expected"
4,First-class content without talking down to students,FINALLY! First class and up-to-date content/writing aimed at HS students. Something for everyone from AP students to general biology students. Breaks difficult concepts down into easy terms without talking down to readers. Good resource for general public and college students too. A definite cut above other books at this level. Better graphics and web support would make it five stars.
3,ROCK N ROLL STAR,"Big hits from some of the best in Rock n' Roll! Some of the black and white videos are not very clear. Sound is ok, but could have been better. Not much thought went into this one. But, it's ok."
1,Love the movie but....,"I love the movie. I would like to agree with all of the above. But for all nonMuslims please try to read on Islamic history and religion first. The movie is not complete. Of course due to Islamic faith we Muslims cannot draw or make a movie showing Mohammad. The movie ignored people like Omar, Abu Bakr... I am sure we cannot show their faces as well. I would like to appluad Mostafa Akkad for his effort. However, a movie on such an important subject must be viewed critically. The movie could have gone deeper and concentrated on the teachings of Islam not just major battles. I still love the movie... but I would recommend the nonMuslim folks to read some literature on Islam first. Start with the Quran or Introduction to Islam...Thank You. May Allah Bless you All."
5,Allah-hu-Akber!(God is Great!)...,"An original masterpeice. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. The struggle betwwen the good and evil. Islam conquers the hearts of all men, and is the true meaning of life. However after watching this film, I've noticed some parts of History taken out of the Holy Prophet Muhammad's life. There were many more battles also, but in the movie it only focused on two. Imam Ali, the successor of The Prophet was also left out, even though he is the most important being in the universe next to The Prophet. Although it had some false artributes, the movie was beautifuly done and the acting and scenes are breathtaking!"
3,Request for improved edition,"The Message (30th Anniversary Edition)Review here is of the 2005 DVD product, ""30th Anniversary Edition."" Having seen only the English-language version on videocassette, I was glad to find a newer release with both English and Arabic films, and hoped for some new bonus features.Alas, after all these years, what we have here is essentially a re-release onto disc of the contents of the old videocassette. The making-of feature is the same one that was included with previous videocassettes. No subtitles of any kind are provided. However, the same analog-access English closed captions from the VHS release are available on the English film. No subtitles or closed captioning on the Arabic version. What a shame that this alternate edition of The Message remains inaccessible to non-Arabic speakers, despite them making the effort to provide the film on disc two.Hopefully we will see a true special edition release of The Message in the future."
5,AMAZING,"This is the best movie i've ever seen. It's so exciting, touching, and breath-taking. What makes it so special to me is that it describes almost step by step my religion as it goes through time, along with the life of the man i love the most, Prophet Mohammad. It makes you feel that you're in that screen, it makes you wish that you were alive and a muslem back then. I advise this movie to all muslems and whoever wants to know more about islam"
2,Which message?,"I first saw this late night on TV when it was called ""Mohammed: Messenger of God"". I was impressed that the start of the film shows that it's been given the seal of approval of authorities in Egypt.I was impressed by the fact that no actor actually plays 'the prophet'. People talk to the camera - as if the camera itself is him.I was drawn to Islam by its simple and direct message. However I was disappointed by the highly selective dealings with his life. His child-bride Aisha is not shown at all.Some of the battles are shown, as he fights to regain entry to Mecca. The subsequent murder of political opposition, and the massacre of hundreds of Banu Qurayza prisoners in cold-blood are excluded from this narrative.If you want a film that completely ignores controversy about the founder of Islam, this is an ideal film."
3,"Great Battles, but the rest is not so good","The dialogues are stilted and the acting stiff,but the battles are intense! The directorhandles not being able to show Mohammedvery well. The reconstruction of old Meccaand all outdoor shots (on location) are verygood, but the matte paintings used to depictthe interior of the Byzantine palace are flat.Unfortunately this comes at the very beginningof the film too. That said, if the topic ofthe film is of interest, this is a good filmto watch."
3,purchased for a friend,"I bought this film for my sister who does not have a computer She was very happy to get it. I don't know anything about it, as I never have seen the movie. The article arrived quickly and was well packaged."
3,Good low budget film.,I enjoyed the film. It may be a little difficult to follow without knowing some basics of Islam.
5,ISLAM RULEZ,"it was an excellent adaptation which took in mind preventing any contradictions what so ever. it gives an excellent insight into the history of Islam. i would recommend this movie to any people of any religion, any culture, and any race because it is a film for anyone to know what islam is about before going on further to mock it."
4,A Great Message,Any one interested in Islam will appreciate this beautifully made film that shows respect towards such a unique religion. The techniques the director used were quite ahead of their time I believe.
5,Historically accurate and straightforward,"I would recommend this product to everyone who wants to see a movie about Islam. Being a 70s made film, it is very simple and gets straight to the point, no fanciness or special effects included. I've seen the other negative reviews, but this is an accurate history of Islam. My recommendation: watch it for yourself before making any judgments and make sure to leave positive or negative reviews out of your mind."
5,Very Moving Film,"This film is actually a documentary that presents the history of the beginning of Islam. The movie shows viewers many of the basic tenets of Islam.The film shows the hardship and the sacrifices early Muslims had to face in order to adhere to this new religion. The atrocity and torture by non-believers toward new comers to Islam was so unbearable that many lost their belongings, others were killed under torture, and others were forced to exile.This is a good movie about the early days of Islam."
5,The never ending story,"I have seen this movie twice. It was about 1978, when I was in West java , Indonesia. I have watck the two version; English and Arabic. I do not know yet this one. It says, shipping soon.I have watch hundrens of films. I never missed them, except this one. I will show this movie to my kids."
1,Difficult to watch,Interesting for those wanting to know more about the historical outgrown of Islam but far from an excellent film. At times the acting is tedious and the dialouge overly heavy. It is difficult to follow the plot due to the odd artistic element of never showing Mohammad's face or allowing him to speak. I had to watch it over several nights and will never suffer through it again. I would not recommend this film.
5,The Message,The message was a vey interesting movie about the prophets life and for people that cuariuos about islam i recemend you seeing this movie.
3,Historical depiction but involves lots of war scenes,The acting is very good. The scenes are interesting. DVD quality is not that good. Historical depiction but involves lots of war scenes so if you're into non-violence it can be hard to watch so many people get killed.
5,one of my favourite movies of all times....,"I decided to buy this DVD version even i watched this movie more than 30 times (the Arabic and English versions) coz i wanted to keep it in my library.... and sure it deserves the money..... u should see this movie either u r a Muslim or not,,, it's really one of the best movies ever...... please see it then judge that... the direction (Mustafa Akkad) is brilliant (notice that this film was made in 1976!!) and the cast (both versions) is superb... great movie..."
2,PROTRACTED,"This video is too long. It becomes boring after a while. It is over-dramatised. Too action packed which I felt was unnecessary.l In my opinion, it is not a block-buster, put it that way."
2,A CAMEL IS A HORSE MADE BY A COMMITTEE...,"To me, it seemed like too many non-movie makers turned a great idea into a flat training film. Talky without conveying the real concepts and passions of this Great world religion. Neither did the characters grow beyond mere outlines. Sum up: Pedantic, slow, flat depication of rich, deep subject and characters. Oh, for David Lean's touch here! Alternative: Lion of the Desert or, of course, Laurance of Arabia..."
5,Perfect Depiction,"""Assalamu aleykum""The movie was perfectly set in order. The reason they do not show the prophet's face, is out of respect. Muhammad is a Prophet, not a character out of a movie. It is the same respect that Christian's, in other such like movies, do not show the face of GOD. This movie, shows you the trials and tribulations of muslims. Islam is a religion of peace. And those that have read the Holy Koran (Q'uran) know all about that. I myself have recently converted. This is a wonderful movie, for anyone, wishing to convert, or anyone who just wants to know a little bit more about Islam and Muslims."
2,you are better off with out this for the LSAT,"I don't know about the other tests but this book is useless for the LSAT. It is too easy and has too many mistakes! Simple things like replacing ""could"" with ""must"" in the answers mess up the whole outcome and this book makes those simple mistakes. I also understand the concept of choosing the lesser of the evils but this book takes it to the extreme! Answers for inference questions are things that really can't be implied any more than what they consider ""wrong"". The LSAT doesn't do that. So far i suggest getting the actual past tests and there are plenty of other prep book out there. I suppose you could use this book to boost you confidence, so i will give it stars for that."
1,You say this is useful for the MCAT?,"If you're planning to use this book for the MCAT, you will be disappointed. The first 3/4 of it deals with material that is not on the MCAT at all. We are told to go to the second section... As for the second section, it is very short, about 1/4 of the book's length. I entirely feel like I wasted my money on a book that deceitfully claimed that it useful for those taking the MCAT."
1,Terrible and error-filled,"I looked at this book while preparing for the LSAT.It deals only with very easy questions and even includes errors in the answer key and explanations. The logical reasoning section is quite horrendous, only introuding questions of mild complexity.I would look elsewhere for a preparation book."
1,Don't buy,"This book is truely superficial, deals with only limited question types. The worst part is logic reasoning, which is nearly zero."
1,The worst logic prep book I ever had...,"People should really avoid this book unless you have too much money, time and effort to waste. Aside from this book only provides limited strategies on cracking the logic questions, it has way way way too many bloodly obvious mistakes in it answer keys. It only does two things: confuses you--because you will never understand the inference process since the answers are wrong; or frustrates you--one MORE mistake is found! I eventually got so frustrated that I had to abandon using this book after getting through about 1/5 of the book. Strongly recommend avoiding using this book."
3,Helpful Product,"Didn't notice anything different but probably helpful product. Order went well with no problems. Product arrived as scheduled, packaging could have been better."
5,A must have for the Great Lakes Carferry enthusiast,"Zimmermann's book catches the spirit of the Lake Michigan Railroad Car Ferries from the Ann Arbor No. 1 to the Chief Wawatam. The Society for the Preservation of the SS City of Milwaukee agrees that the ship represents the pinnacle of carferry design. The ship is a National Historic Landmark, and Zimmermann's story and photo's describe his Lake Michigan carferry experience in detail. As Zimmermann states in the book, the SS City of Milwaukee is being preserved at Elberta, Michigan."
1,Never worked consistently for my dog,"The collar never worked consistently for my golden doodle. Judging by his actions, I'd say it worked less than 20% of the time and I tried a wide variety of settings for the collar and the barrier unit."
2,Didn't Work with our Existing Collar,"We were looking forward to using this to keep our dog out of the kitchen. We already have a SportDog brand inground fence system which works perfectly to keep our dog in the yard. This PetSafe Pawz Away system did not work with our existing SportDog collar like we were hoping. Bummer!! So, instead of putting 2 collars on our dog, we are returning the PetSafe transmitter and looking for a similar product that is compatible with SportDog. If you're planning to use an existing collar, make sure your system is compatible, so you don't have to pay for return shipping like we did!"
2,It didn't work for long,"For 2 weeks, I thought this was an excellent product. But it just doesn't seem to be as effective now. I've changed batteries thinking that would help, but it doesn't. The batteries don't sit in the collar very well and we've had to put a rubber band around the lid to keep the batteries fitting tight. I wouldn't recommend this."
4,Pleased,"We installed the petsafe unit because we wanted to keep our pet out from going through a doorway, and we also wanted her off of the couch. Unfortunately we spend a lot of time away from home, so we couldn't consistently train her. We bought the units, did some quick training and have been pleased with how effective it has been. In order to contain the whole couch the radius of 'enforcement' is a little bigger than we had hoped - she can't get anywhere near the couch but that's better than her being able to sneak up there.If you want to keep your pet out of certain areas in the home, I would recommend this product."
1,Sucks,"It sucks. I've got a 10 pound mini aussie and it doesn't keep her out of anything. It is very inconsistant, occasionally she'll yelp at being shocked, and most times, she'll sit within a foot of the transmitter eating cat food. Its range is also very small, the radius on the highest setting is below the 3 feet claimed."
5,Love these !,"Love the Innotek Zone system. It keeps our puppy away from things we do not want him near and/or things we do not want him to chew such as houseplants. We have several zones around our house, they have been a livesaver!!"
4,Black Boy was a truly rich and fullfilling novel;two thumbs,I really liked this book. I am in eight grade and we had to read part one for school but it was so good i read both parts.
5,Spiritually Enlightening Daily Meditations,"All of Sri Chinmoys' books are spiritually enlightening/uplifting (and should be required reading for everyone) because he is a genuine spiritual master. However, this book focuses on the daily spiritual aphorisms as a tool for meditation/contemplation in our daily lives."
3,Pills Galore,"Great very heavy sheets! Washed before using and I'm amazed at the heavy pilling. They're everywhere! If they keep producing pills at the current rate, there won't be any sheets left in another week!"
2,Twilight color nowhere near the photo,"after much research on the other flannel sheets available and reading their reviews, I decided to go for this sheet just because of the color. There were other sheets for lesser price with decent reviews but the color I was looking for was not available. When I opened the pack, I thought I had been shipped the wrong color as it had happened once before but it said 'Twilight' on the package. Its much much more darker and dull than what is shown - more like dark blue than the bright light blue shown in the pic. I havent even opened it and thinking of returning it so cannot comment on the quality."
4,Great value,"the price was so great (~$12 for king size) I purchased four of them! It is extremely thick and heavy, but yet breathable. I purchased 2 ivory (One for my mom), one coco, and one twilight (More of a navy.) Warm and cuddly, it was a good buy. However, after several washes (about 3-5) it has already started to pill badly. (The ivory one, since it's getting warmer, I havent opened up the other ones yet...saving them for winter.)For the value in terms of quality and price, these are better than the Pinzon 190gram velvet flannel (Although those does not pill, it is not as soft, and it cost 5x as much as these.) however, they dont compare to the pinzon 200gram velvet flannel sheets. (Hands down, those are the best!)Despite the fact that these are already starting to pill (for some odd reason, only the fitted sheet is starting to pill, not the flat.) for the price I paid, these are worth it.I would reccommend them."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased these because at the time they were on sale, and extremely inexpensive for a King set. Color is beautiful (Cypress) and perfect for my decor, and they were extremely soft for the first two to three washings. However, after just a few washings (following recommendations, although I DO use a small dryer sheet) they have pilled, pilled, pilled. Not out of the dryer, but after sleeping on them. No longer comfortable."
4,Warm sheets!,these are great for cold nights. nothing beats flannel for comfort through the coldest nights.
3,"Informative, but biased.","This book was fun to read, but should not be portrayed as a total representation of 1968 in America. Kaiser was very obviously a liberal, more specifically a McCarthy supporter, and much of his book focuses on this. The reader gains a great insight into what it was like on the McCarthy campaign trail. But there is significantly less focus on the other candidates at this time. 1968 is very focused on politics, but the references to music, culture, and the idea of revolution were great. Kaiser should have spent more focus on these topics. 1968 is a good read, but take it at face value, one man's veiw of the times."
2,Big Subject -- Tiny Book,"Does a good job of presenting the outlook of a white, Jewish, liberal college student living in New York in 1968. There is nothing wrong with that in itself but Kaiser's frame of refernce and the material he choses covers are hardly large enough to warrant ""The Shaping of a Genertion"" claim in the title. ""1968 on The Upper West Side: Music, Democratic Politics and the Shaping of Charles Kaiser"" would seem a more apt title.Despite this narrow focus, what Kaiser does cover is written about in an adequate, if somewhat bland, journalistic style."
2,Poor quality sound and bad reception,I bought this because it had a digital radio with presets as opposed to most that are analog. The reception was not very good. I had the wire antennae up on the window of a second floor room and it could not catch stations that radios on the first floor catch. It has a tiny little speaker with so-so sound quality. The display is good and the buttons are intuitive and it is smaller than it looks if that is important. I am returning it though and trying something else. If I can't catch my favorite radio station it is not much good to me.
1,Cheap price for a cheap product,"If your looking for cd radio clock player that has a great clear sound, great reception on fm or am radio, can play any burned or regular CD's without skipping or scratching then this is not the product for you. I purchased this item earlier this year and was dismayed to find that the product did not meet my expectations at all. The sound was scratchy, you could not get reception from the radio, and depending on the clocks sitting position the CD player would not work. I recommend that if your going to buy a CD clock radio player that it is actually cost effective to spend the extra 10 dollars thst would buy you an RCA or Memorex radio/cd player (which I have by the way and let me tell you it was worth every penny) due to the fact that you will receive a better quality system, the sounds are clearer, you can actually hear base in the music and the alarm system works."
3,Works ok in Linux but better options,"This works ok in Linux as it supports hardware mixing in ALSA. You don't have to mess around with asoundrc, dmix or setting up sources. However, there are better options available. Look for a Sound Blaster Audigy 2 or 4 if you can find one cheap. I have used both this card and an audigy 2. I haven't found an Audigy 4 for a decent price yet."
3,Interesting read but predictable,"NAPM, NAPL is Archer's first novel. It is a quick and interesting read, but lets the reader wonder at the author's thought process. The novel is about how a clever businessman, Harvey Metcalfe, makes a million dollars by fooling four people, and how they come together and get back their money ... till the last penny.Interesting though, one cannot believe that someone as brilliant as Metcalfe would fall for some cheap tricks played on him by the foursome. Huge sections of the novel become predictable, and for someone who has read Kane & Abel, it will not be tough to guess that the girl someone's doting with is the daughter of the man he wishes to beat.However, the way the characters are built and the descriptions of events are wonderful - quite the way we've come to expect from Archer.Overall, I would say '3 stars' ... cannot do much with the predictable storyline..."
3,The plot is rather crudely solved.,A much too elaborate and complicated plot to be convincing. It lacks finesse and does not develop easily or naturally.
2,A slight disappointment,"I like the author's writing style, and this was a decent solid 3-3.5 story until chapter 17, then the story plunged to a 2 as I felt the scenario was too unbelievable and it turned some decent characters into not-so-nice characters. The story did keep a good pace and pulled itself back to a solid 3-3.5 until the very end -- where *unrevealed spoiler* takes place and is followed by an abrupt ""the end"". The writing style is good enough, I'll consider reading another story from this author."
4,"Good, but not its best","It's not that anything in the plot is missing; indeed, some of the twists are truly amazing. What bothered me about this book was how he couldn't quite manage to fit in the detail as seamlessly as he normally does. Many of the details seemed quite contrived and put in for the sole purpose of showing off that Archer knew the details"
4,Fast-pacing and well written,"Although this book has the ability to grab one's brain and locks it until the last page has been closed, it, nevertheless, is still a little bit too fictious. In all of Archer's work, one of his specialties is making everything sounds real. Everything is likely to happen in real life. But, with this particular book, everything is just too perfect. Nothing has gone wrong and each plan would seem okay if we are living in the smooth world. Unfortunately, we are not."
4,"No great literature but does what it needs to do, entertains",I liked it very much. This is 'Lord' Archers' first novel and indeed a good start of what was to follow. Read it and enjoy it.
3,"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny less","I was disappointed, it just was not as interesting as many of his other books. I thought the story contrived. Otherwise I am a fan of Jeffrey Archer's books."
3,Entertaining read,"Certainly not a top novel by any stretch of the imagination, but a very entertaining and enjoyable read."
3,SIMPLE YET A QUICK AND ENTERTAINING READ,ABOUT WHAT I EXPECTED OF A 300 PAGE BOOK. A SIMPLE PLOT WITH AFEW TWISTS AND TURNS. THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT HIS BEST WORK AND PALESIN COMPARISON WITH MOST OF JEFFREY ARCHER'S OTHER CLASSICS. A GOOD BOOK TO BRING TO THE BEACH AND FINISH IN 2-3 DAYS.
4,Archer in a different tone.,"This book reflects the lighter side of Archer's work. 4 men are scammed into investing in a start-up oil company formed purely for the purpose of the scam. One of them is actually in the employ of the oil company.He turns up for work one day to find the doors locked and the owner unreachable. The shares then go down in price faster than Enron stock.This man takes it upon himself to gather up the other 3 major investors and form 4 plans to scam the owner with the intention of getting their money back; not a penny more, not a penny less.There's a lot of comedic play between the men, which I'm not used to in Archer's work but, it works. The characters are well developed and, their parts play well.There are the usual twists and turns but, you get the feeling Archer was in a lighthearted mood when he wrote the book.It's a fast read and, again, another Archer novel thoroughly enjoyed."
4,Revenge served cold,"I have read a number of Jeffrey Archer's books but had never read this one, which was published back in the mid-1970s. It is the story of four men who are swindled out of a large sum of money who decide to get revenge on the swindler and hatch a plot to get their money back. The premise is great and the plot moves quickly. Surprisingly, even though it was published more than 30 years ago, the plot stands up to present day (although it clearly would involve more technology and probably larger sums of money today). It was a very quick, enjoyable read."
3,"""Okay all I could give it",Loved Jeffrey Archer's new trilogy. This book does not compare with that. And actually I have LOVED all other books I have read that Archer has written (have not read ALL of them) but not quite up to snuff on this one.
4,You gotta love a good swindle,"This book was great. I don't usually read these types of books, as they bore me stupid with their anal attention to detail.Archer has written a book that is humurous, detailed and above all enjoyable.Well worth a look."
4,Another fun read by Archer,"Archer's books are the ultimate in what I call ""What happens next"" fiction. That is, you keep turning the pages because you are dying to know the next turn of the plot. On top of that, his final twists always make for a satisfying ending. This book is a shining example of both of these talents. It is not his most smoothly written book, as it was early in his career as a novelist, but it is a very enjoyable read."
5,Great Read,Could'nt put it down. Very easy to read. Great story line with great humour. Four men get even..a master scam artist gets a taste of his own medicine. Must Read!!
4,"The Best: Not a Bit More, Not a Bit Less.","This is one of my favorite short novels. I am sure it would be difficult for anyone to believe that this is Archer's first published novel.The story is about four men, versatile in their own field hoodwinked by a crafty swindler luring them to buy millions of worthless stocks. The four men aptly decide to conglomerate and get back their money exactly - not a penny more, not a penny less - without the knowledge of the crook. The plots the men make and the implementations may not sound all that believable, especially on a life-time criminal. Yet, Archer holds the grip throughout the story in his own way. A refreshing novel which made me finish on one go.A perfect balance between a novel and a short story, the story is sure to enthral the audience who like Archer. If you haven't read Archer before, its worth a read."
5,"Don't wait a second more, but order this book","Highly successful businessman Harvey Metcalfe isn't above some shady dealings, and when his stock manipulation costs an art dealer, an Oxford don, an aristocrat, and a doctor a large amount of money, they get together, study their target, and decide to con the conman. How they do this is an absolute delight, taking you from the courts of Wimbledon to the casinos of Monte Carlo to Metcalfe's own Massachusetts home. You will find yourself liking Harvey--but still rooting on the four as they seek to get back exactly what they were mulcted of.Sure, the ending's a bit contrived, but so what? It is still a great book.It was poorly adapted into a four-hour miniseries starring Ed Asner as Harvey. The book is far, far better.Archer's first, but in most ways his best."
5,Top jazz,The results of this amazing project is incredible. Straight to the heart and soul!I'm waiting for another project.Arjan
3,"Russian, Not Greek","Larisa is a Russian singer, not a Greek singer. The songs are in the Russian and so is the print on the casing. Pay no attention to the references to ""Greek"" that is posted incorrectly on this site."
4,Good Reference Material,"As a basic introductory of arnis, the book makes a good reference material. As a student myself of arnis, under DLSU Arkado-Arnis Association, I noticed some similarity and dissimilarity in the techniques being shown. Perhaps it could be said that each organization of arnis has a unique way of presenting the art."
2,It's Just OK,"We bought this guitar for our son for Christmas after reading the positive reviews. It's better than the piece of junk you get from a toy store, but definitely not a real instrument. The strings do not hold tone - our boy still prefers to play with Daddy's guitars. We kept this one just so the little one can bang it on the floor instead of the real guitars. Quite disappointed, I'd have to say!"
4,"This guitar is nice, tunes well","I bought this guitar for my 8 year old son. As a boy, I always wanted a guitar, but my parents didn't buy one for me. They bought one for my brother instead! He didn't even want one...nor did he even let me play it. SO I never got one, and never really learned to play...We live through our kids, don't we? So now my son is learning to play...(my idea lol). I hope that he will want to keep learning. This guitar is nice, tunes well, and sounds pretty good. Who knows...maybe the next Eric Clapton"
5,My son loves this guitar,"We bought this nine months ago for my son's second birthday.He has played with it just about every day since.The quality is excellent. For us, it was well worth the money."
3,"With a little work, this is a neat little guitar","I wasn't very happy with this little guitar when it arrived. There were several strings that sounded deadened, and it would not stay in tune. Since I already owned the guitar, I decided to see what could be done. I bought a new set of Gotoh classical tuners,a new set of quality strings, and proceeded to install them.Installing the tuners was easy and straigt forward, the only caution I have is to look at how the old pegs turn before you install the new ones. I didn't know how to tie the strings, so I Googled installing nylon strings, and found instructions that were easy to follow.After installing the tuners and pre-stretching the strings, I was pleasantly surprised with the sound of this little guitar, and it now holds its tune very well."
4,No need for discount,"If you don't know about ""Super Discount"" then you might need to look for some professional help. Etienne De Crecy is the prince of French house and his ""Super Discount"" is the project that curved the path for the whole genre. Three years later he returns with ""Tempovision"". Now that every one is a DJ and dance music is over hyped it is hard to come up with something new so Etienne De Crecy just slowed down a little and tried to create a musical piece that will live up to the expectations. And he succeeded. It's brilliant."
2,Over Priced!!!,the book was falling a part and the cover was taped on. I dont think i got my moneys worth for a book that was half destroyed.
4,For Beginners Only...,Microprocessors and Microcomputers by Ronld Tocci provides an good introduction to the microprocessor world. It does a very good job at explaing what the different components of a microprocessor based system does and how they fit together. This book is not for someone who is resonably knowledgable about the subject (i.e. you have already built and programed a simple microcontroller or microprocessor based system). The more experienced need to find a title targeting their specific processor of choice.
3,soso tackhead,I think my love for Tackhead and Gary Clail are well-known but this album lacks a bit in the production department. As was almost allways the case with Tackhead albums it never seems to do them justice. Oh and Gary Clail's later albums are simply fantastic.
5,Huge comfy blanket,I love this blanket and so does my son. He walks with it wrapped around him like a king's robe in the morning. I got an Eagles one for my other son from a different manufacturer and it was not nearly as large or nice. This can just about work as a blanket on a full size bed- is a little large for a throw on the couch but it works for us.
5,"Thorough, easy-to-read, and compelling.","With this concise and easy-to-read book, you can actually obtain a rather thorough overview of North Korea's history, current situation, and its future outlook. Many people, unfortunately, simply look upon North Korea as an 'evil' country. This book will help you to better understand, and to be more sympathetic towards, North Korea's plight. A must-read for anyone who wishes to begin to understand the North Korean situation."
5,A Colorful Treasure,"What a wonderful gift for a graduate, someone starting a new adventure, a friend in need of hope, and anyone who could use some visual and verbal inspiration. This deceptively small and simple-looking square book is full of uplifting messages, good advice, beautiful, whimsical illustrations and JOY. Readers can bask in positive energy upon turning the first page. SARK fans will quickly become Christine Miller fans, too!"
4,"brings back real memories of 60's at ""THE SHORE "". LOVE IT!",Captures real feeling of the times and the music at the jersey shore in the 60's.First rate performances by a solid cast. Music was excellent for a retrospective score.The script and direction well paced and clear.This movie stands the test of time. Your review by tom keogh is mean spirited and unrealistic. He seems upset this was not citizen kane.
3,If you have nothing to do on a Friday evening...,"Eddie and the Cruisers will kill an hour and a half painlessly but it's not going to go down in history as a classic. The plot -- a reporter tracks down those who knew or played with Eddie (Michael Pare) in his legendary 60s band -- crosses Citizen Kane with The Doors but without the originality of either. Pare is mediocre at best, and even Barkin seems flat. The music has a Jersey shore feel, and it's catchy enough, but there's no depth, and thus nothing to explain why anyone cares what happened to Eddie or the Cruisers."
5,So Where's The Sequel?,"Despite what others may say - great movie, great soundtrack. Hey, everyone has a right to their own opinion and that's mine! Maybe the plot is just a little off-the-wall and stretches things a little, but it is plausible although highly unlikely. Compared to some other rock and roll oriented movies, this one is a classic. If you enjoy good music in a dramatic setting, you'll probably like this one. Now, just one question: When do we get Eddie II, Eddie Lives?"
2,Buyer beware,"Didn't MGM receive some flack about their ""Escape from New York"" DVD last year? You betcha. A lousy transfer and one theatrical trailer to constitute the ""Special Bonuses"". Last I heard, they stopped production of it out of embarrassment. I wish someone would raise a red flag about ""Eddie and the Cruisers"". MGM's DVD release of this movie is a rip-off (specifics below in another review). It makes you wonder just how many of their DVD's they're shortchanging everybody on without the buyer knowing it. The ""Cruisers"" movie is still wonderful to watch(I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it), I just hate being misled with my own money."
4,Good movie.,"This is a good movie about a time in history when just about anyone and everyone was writing and playing music. Not a great movie, but entertaining."
4,Eddie Rocks,"What is is about film reviewers that they always forget what it is like to be a kid again? Eddie does that, takes me back to when I was a kid. The cool cars and the music that when you sat back and listened had meaning unlike the doff doff of today. This movie is about a band and their lead singer Eddie who is gifted to the point of not being able to relate or communicate to other band members other than to mesmerise than with his interperation of music and what it takes to acheive greatness. It also shows the dark side of the music industry in that they destroy the band, Eddie in particular. The soundtrack to this movie is grossly underrated and I have often laughed at the reference to the E Street Band as this would have been a giant album had it been released in the 60's as it is in the movie."
5,One of the great rock movies of all time,"With it's great soundtrack by John Cafferty, and great acting by Michael Pare' as Eddie and a young Ellen Barkin as a reporter investigating Eddie's disappearance and assumed death in the mid 1960s, this movie is one of the greatest rock themed movies ever. Eddie is the leader of a rock band which for it's time is cutting edge. In 1963, Eddie & the Cruisers work on an album that is light years ahead of anything they or anyone else had ever done. Through Barkin's interviews with the band members and others who knew Eddie, we discover the perfectionist Eddie was, his commitment to the project of releasing his new album and how he dealt with critical reaction to that album. A great song from the soundtrack is ""On the Dark Side,"" a rocker with a Neil Diamond ""Cherry Cherry"" chord progression. I love both the movie and it's soundtrack. I highly recommend Eddie & the Cruisers."
5,"A great movie, with awesome music!","I love this movie, I saw John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band. When they sang On the Dark Side and Tender Years, I couldn't help but picture Eddie. It's like they were his songs not theirs. I need to find Eddie and the cruisers part II. Please contact me if u have info."
5,Suprise ending shocks many,I discovered Eddie and the Cruisers when I was Six years old and now 10 years later I'm still hooked. I Think that the sound track is the best of any movie and since it's recent rerealease the only complaint I have about it is that the song Tender Years is no where to be found. I also wish I could find the song Wild Summer nights If anyone knows where I can find these songs new or used please contact me at Liz_19@hotmail.com
1,Wrong Disk,"unfortunately my family and i just went to watch the movie and discovered that they had put ""The Hellfighters"" disk in the ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" case and since we were beyond the return window we were stuck with the wrong DVD.for certain situations the return window just does not work."
1,Dull and boring,"I had no idea this movie was going to be so bad. The acting was terrible, the story was SO LAME, and the music was a joke. My biggest regret about buying this is that it's going to take up space on my DVD shelf, and there is no one in the world I would give this to. I only spent 5 bucks on it, but that and the two hours of boredom make me want to kick myself for buying it at all.Don't waste your money. If you want my copy, just yell."
1,"Cheap movie, bad acting","When I see a minute used in a movie to show a car pulling up to a house, shutting off the motor, two actors getting out and walking up to the front door and unlocking the door and going inside, I'm pretty sure the movie is short on plot and needs filler to make it movie length. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! I've always thought Tom Berringer didn't make it to real stardom because he could not act very well--his emotions in this movie go from occasonally raising his eyebrows to occasionally smiling. But then again, no one else in the movie shows any real feeling either. Maybe these actors would have made it big in melo-drama back in the 1890's. Maybe that was the 1980's style. At any rate, this movie is just going through the motions much lie a tv movie-of-the-week from the era. I think the Merchant Ivory and Merimax studios were born in the 1980's--maybe the cast of ""Eddie"" should have watched a few of those classics before setting out on this terrible movie."
3,Ok film but a little too on the philosophical side,"I can't usually stand films from the 80's (or later) about the 1960's. These films tend to be so mindless and with the idea that sex, drug, rock'n'roll, and bad assed attitudes are good things. EATC does have a good story and acting (specially Joe Pantoliano as Doc). The period flavor of the early 60's seems nearly faultless. But the advocacy of being a bad ass in the head of the rock band (eddie) is a turnoff. Also, the story teeters on being mindless itself."
3,What happened to Michael Pare?,"Michael Pare stars in this. When the film was released they thought he would be a superstar. It didn't happen. It's about a singer who has success then vanishes. When the movie first came out, I truly enjoyed it. But, time has diminished it somewhat. I guess the surprise ending is no longer a surprise? Tom Berringer costars and looks real good in this film."
3,Need to read the fine print,"I would have given this product a five, excepting that they didn't tell all the story, at least not without digging into the fine print.Seems you also need to buy a universal adapter bracket for an added $100 and change plus an additional shipping charge that matched the first one.They could have made it much more prominent that this device would not work as advertised without this additional purchase, saved me double shipping and an added week and a half wait."
3,"This mount is OK, you can probably do better","This mount is decent, I have had it in use for approx. 7 years. As other reviewer said, you need separate Omnimount kit ""UAL"" or ""UA-L"" in order to mount your TV to this.Cable management is relatively old-school; you ziptie cables to the bottom of the arm, and that's that. It works fine, but it's not the prettiest if it's an installation where the cabling will be in view.It was quite sturdy while holding up an 80lb sony KE-42XS910 plasma for 7 years, and I recently upgraded to a larger, lighter, Sony KDL-46EX720 LCD TV using the UAL mounting kit.Also note - current owners of this mount - Omnimount has a safety recall out for this mount."
2,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--Dusty Old Jokes,"The humor in this book is dated & faded in the worst way.Ethnic references disturb the modern reader, & baffling references & remarks from a bygone age abound.Much of the 60s humor has aged well, & I like most of it.Not this."
5,Review of Artic Express Carol of the Bells Sheet Music,Artic Express Carol of the Bells is one of my favorite piance pieces. The sheet music is terrific. I look forward to practicing! Music arrived on a timely basis. Great job Thanks!
2,Very little bell music,"It is ok, just not the beautiful bell music I was hoping for. It has kind of a new age edge to it, and at times seems a little on the depressing side...just not what I wanted. They really should rename it...it's not bells...don't buy it if that is what you are looking for."
4,Jazzy and upbeat,I like all the songs on the CD. The arrangements were jazzy and upbeat - different from any other Christmas albums I own.
2,Famous Country Music Makers Don Gibson,"Item did not list songs. I assumed they would be the same as the old LP. It was 3 or 4 songs short, songs that I wanted and was the reason I purchased the CD. It seems the makers of this CD couldn't find the songs either. A rip off.This reflects badly on Amazon and shows they don't monitor their vendors!!"
3,a must have Extreme collectible!,"This CD is an EP released in Japan only. It features five tracks(1 edit,1 unreleased,3 live). The unreleased track on the EP is definitly catchy. ""When Will it Rain"" is a piano-organ laden track. Which features some excellent vocals from Gary Cherone(now with Van Halen). The song has a Tori Amos meets Everclear feel to it. I also must praise Nuno on this track. He's a great musician that can put soul into any instrument he touches. Let's just say that if you admire Extreme and you have the cash to dish out for an imported CD. Then you have nothing to lose and some great music to gain."
5,The story of a boy that will never quit .,Dear Mr.Henshaw was about a boy named Leigh.He constantly writes to an author. Leigh finds insterest in him. Leigh had went into a contest for writing. Leigh didn't win but he got honorable mention.He was kinda mad though. well the contest was for everybody but the girls were excited because they were going to meet Angela Badger.One of the girls had cheated so the libarian had picked Leigh to go in her place.He wasnt happy because she only writes about girls. During the time the girls were chattering to Angela.For some reason she ask leigh if he wrote the day on dads rig he say yes.She had said that he is a good Author.Liegh could not stop thinking about it.I like the part when leigh had won hornable mention because I did too in a contest at my school.I didnt like the part when he was acting shy. by Seshauna Rubie.
5,Estevan revirw,"My favorite part is when leigh write to mr.henshaw. The part I didn't like is when he lose. the main charcater are barry, leigh,mr.henshaw,and leigh mom. the main setting are school,leighhouse,outside.This book is a geat book because I give it 5star. If I had to tell a friend about this book I will tell them to read it because it is a great book."
4,A boy who meets a famous auther by Manuel Sanatna,"The story dear mr henshaw was a great book. The main charter is leigh botts. He is a very optimistic person. He never look on the bad side of the situation. Then he had to write a story for a contest. He didnt win, but he got honable mention. That was good for him. Then the judes founed that one of the winners had cheated. So he had the chance to go. He had aceeped. Then he got to meet the auther. That was the best time for him ever."
4,Dear Mr.Henshaw,"Dear Mr.Henshaw is a really good book!!! The main problem is about a boy named Leigh and he writes to an author, Mr.Henshaw about his problem's. He also asks him how to become a better writer. Leigh's parents are divorced and Leigh really wants them to get back together. Leigh's dad is a trucker and Leigh's mom is a caterer. Leigh wins this contest and get's to meet an author he hopes is Mr.Henshaw but he wasn't; she's actually Mrs.Badger, an author of girl's books. Leigh talks to her and he is amased that she actually liked the poem he wrote ( that was what the contest was about). Don't want to spoil the end soo.. if you want to find out what happens you have to READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!"
4,Dear Mr. Henshaw,"Beverly Cleary writes about a serious topic sprinkled with light humor. The letter/diary format is a refreshing change. The conflicts Leigh Botts struggles with are very relatable for school age readers. Many positive messages are sent through this book. The story shows that problems can be solved within yourself. In today's violent society, Leigh's patient and well thought out way of dealing with the lunchbox theif sends another positive message."
5,Highly recommed this book.,"Trying to pick up the pieces left from divorce, I am always looking for books my 9 yr. old son can relate to. This is one of those books. It kept his interest and provided us with lots of good discussions. Thank-you!"
3,A pretty good book,"This is an interesting and boring book at the same time. All it is is letters and diary entries, but some of them are interesting. I like the basic story, but I would never even think of giving this book a ""10.&quot"
1,depressing....,"I read this book to my older children several years ago. Even before we had any idea that our family would experience divorce, I found the book depressing. In one letter, the boy writes that he was talking to his father on the phone, but his father had to hang up because the he was taking his new wife (or was it girlfriend?) and HER son out to eat. The boy and his mother couldn't afford to go out. So sad! The fact that it is perhaps ""realistic"" makes it no better. I would think that if my children had to read this in school after their father and I divorced, it would just encourage them to focus on their wounds. I see no reason to have children read depressing material. Not recommended at all."
4,The dog who ran away,I think the book is a good book to read. When i read this book it makes me think alot. This book is good for parents to read to there children. The dog who ran away is fun to read. Everybody should read this book.
5,cool,This book is the best book I have.I will never will find a book like this again.The best part is when Liegh is seeing his dad and they stood there and did not say nothing for a long time.It was good because it was really good when Banit and Liegh's dad that came and came to Liegh's house to see him and his mom.So when you find the book you will really good.And you will give it five stars too.
3,Was not the best but.. good,This book was basically about a kid who is having a hard time couping with the divorce of his parents. It tells about his struggles with the new school and people stealing food from his lunchbox.Not really nerve racking or exciting.But it shows children how to cope with divorce.
5,"An excellent, very real, story of a boy struggling with his parents divorce","Leigh Botts writes letters to his favorite author, Boyd Henshaw, and eventually starts a diary. Into both the letter and the diary he pours his sorrow and anger over his parents divorce, his lack of friends and problems with the mysterious ""lunchbox thief"" at school, his dream to become a writer, and the memory of his beloved dog, Bandit, who left with his irresponsible trucker dad. Although the book is a drama, Mrs. Clearly adds humor as well. With very real characters and story, this book won a gold Calacott medal.- Sarah"
4,very good but...,"I liked this book a lot. I finished reading it yesterday and couldn't put it down. At first when I saw how the entire book was written by letter form I was a bit disappointed. But then as I began reading, I enjoyed it a lot. Toward the end, I got more in suspense on what was going to happen. Like I said, the entire book was well written. Except the ending. It was very short and had an abrupt stop. I didn't enjoy the ending at all. Actually, I wish there was more to it. I understand by what the author was heading for but still I don't think it was a very good ending for such a good book. Overall though: I liked it a lot. I reccommend it!"
5,Dear Mr. Henshaw Review by Charlie,"Dear Mr. Henshaw by Beverly Cleary is a funny book, filled with surprises. I would give this book five stars. It is a book about a kid named Leigh who keeps writing to an author named Mr. Henshaw. Leigh's parents were recently divorced and Leigh is annoyed about it. The way Leigh's mother and father have been acting is making him sick. Leigh has no friends because he is the new kid in school. That makes me sad. Leigh then becomes friends with the janitor which is weird. Leigh keeps having food stolen from his lunchbox everyday. He becomes furious with his treats getting stolen. I would recommend this book because it is a hilarious book to read."
4,Dear Mr. Henshaw is a great book for all ages!,"Beverly Cleary is making Dear Mr. Henshaw funny and humorous. It is a really sad and touching book. This book would be a great understanding of a kid with divorced parents. The book would be great for a person who is bored of books. The book I chose to read might be able to change a person from not reading, to reading! Dear Mr. Henshaw was unique from other books. Instead of a regular story, the book is a series of letters and entries from Leigh's diary. The book gave more information when Leigh gets his diary. Overall, Dear Mr. Henshaw is a great book for any person of any age."
4,Must read this book!,The name of the book that I read is Dear Mr. Henshaw by Beverly Clearly. This book is great. This book is about some one who stole Leigh Botts lunch. Only the good stuff in the lunch. Then he makes a burglar alarm to catch the burglar. Do you want to know if he catches the burglar ... Read this book.
1,horrible book,"I can not read this book because, it can get extremely boring at times, so please do not read it. I Mean it's only about letteers."
3,this book was ok,"Dear Mr. Henshaw by Beverly Cleary was an ok book. Its all about an 11 year old boy named Leigh Botts and what he writes in his letters and journal. The letters are to Mr. Henshaw an author of ""Ways to Amuse a Dog."" Leigh is having a tough time because his parents are going through a divorce and he needs someone to talk to. Leigh finds out that someone is stealing his lunch every day. So he makes an alarm for his lunchbox. Leigh also has a dog named bandit who stays with his dad who is a trucker. and Leigh stays with his mom. this book was ok. I would not recommend it."
3,Dear Mr. Henshaw,"Dear Mr. Henshaw is a very good book written by Beverly Cleary. It's about a boy whose parents are divorced and his dad drives cross country in a rig, which is a truck. Leigh writes letters to Mr. Henshaw (an author) as part of a school project. He writes in a diary about his daily problems. He has a lot of trouble with people stealing the good food out of his lunch. We liked the part when Leigh got to build a burglar alarm. We like this book because it has a lot of detail and description. It is so good that we couldn't put the book down. This book is good for kids between fourth and sixth grade."
4,Dear Mr. Henshaw,Jimmy carnes book 3/26/07 reviewThere are numerous problems and solutions in Dear Mr. Henshaw. The 2 lager problems are no one is inviting him over after school and someone is stealing his lunch. The minute I read about leigh not having any friends I went in shock because he sounds awesome.Beverly Cleary is so descriptive like when she describes what kind of lunch box and alarm he buys so he can capture the criminal you have to read to see if he does. If I were him I would have just give up but he didn't .this is a realistic fiction piece. This book is good for all ages because of its heart warming solutions.
3,Dear Mr. Henshaw,"Dear Mr. Henshaw by Beverly Cleary. A New Year Wining Book. A good, nice, excellent book.In the boo""Dear Mr. Henshaw"" the characters were Leigh Botts and his dad was Bill Botts. The story took place in Bakersfield and then it took place in Pacific Grove California. Leigh was introduced in second grade. As he was getting older the parents of Leigh got divorced. Beverly Cleary writes a lot of conflicts so I'm just going to talk about two of them. One of them is when he moves to the new city called Pacific Grove. At his new school kid always had to steal his good stuff out of his lunch box so Leigh had to get mad. Another conflict was that Leigh's mom and is dad were getting divorced and then the dad of Leigh goes out with another girl and the girl has a kid already.The author style is was that he was writing in a diary. Another style was that he was writing to an author.I recommend this book to people 10 and older I really like this book it is so interesting."
5,daughter loved the book,my daughter loved it when she checked it out from her school library but wanted one of her own and now enjoys even more
4,Dear Mr. Henshaw by a 9 year old reviewer,"This book is about what Leigh Botts writes in his diary and to one of his favorite authors named Mr. Henshaw. The three main parts of the story are his school story and the story of the Lunchbox Burglar Bell and the main thing he is writing about which is missing his dad. The story has a lot of funny and sad parts. It is really telling you a good story about this boy. Part of a good story is having parts that are sad and parts that are sort of scary, parts were he is angry, parts that are exciting, parts that are normal, and some that are funny.It has a lot of detail about things like making a lunch box burglar bell. The boy in the book knows his dad loves him even though his parents are divorced. In the end his dad comes back to visit him and """"all it took was some broccolli,""and also because his dad really missed him."
5,Entertains and inspires,This is one of the best children's books I have ever read. It is original - funny - sad - yet also uplifting. The characters are real and the story-telling is right on. It is a great premise. A boy is writing letters to his favorite author and finds himself sharing about real-life stuff like his parents' separation. He continues to write about what he is going through in a journal (at the author's suggestion) and keeps the format of letters to this author that he really admires because it works for him. The book has a lot to say to kids about the power of writing - and about being original when you create something. There are also many great examples of support being shown to the boy like from the janitor and his mom. I couldn't wait to recommend it to my kids.
3,mr henshaw review,"Dear Mr. Henshaw is ok. It could be better. Some events from the story are ; someone stealing food from Leigh's lunch box. He then makes a burglar alarm. Leigh enters in a Young Author's Yearbook contest by writting a story. He also easts with a famous author for winning. The setting was in his house and in his school in Bakersfield, California. Leigh had two problems. His dad lost his dog Bandit. His dad then got him back. The other problem is food was stolen from his lunch box. This stopped with a burglar alarm."
3,Dear Mr. Henshaw,"The name of my book is Dear Mr. Henshaw. This book was written by Beverly Cleary. I liked this book because it is about a child&#65533;s life. The way it is written is also pretty cool because at the top it would say, &#65533;Dear Mr. Henshaw&#65533; or &#65533;Dear Journal&#65533;. It is a journal written about his life. It is about a child&#65533;s parents who got divorced and he has a tough time handling things without his father. He always gets his lunch stolen so he decides to put an alarm on it. His dog Bandit goes with his father and his father lost Bandit, but then found him again. What I didn&#65533;t like about this book was that they talk about one thing and then move on to a different topic. There is more to the story, but I don&#65533;t want to give it away. If you read this book you will find out what happens."
3,"""An Ok book""",This book was an ok book.I didn't like it because it was about a boy writing letters to an author (Mr. Henshaw). The part I liked was about how Beverly Cleary described everything very well. I was sort of suprised when I read this book because it didn't sound like Beverly Cleary's writing.
3,Nice children's book,"I've always wanted to read this as a child, but never got the chance to. The title sounded appealing to me as a child and it looked good because it won a Newberry Award. However, I didn't get to read it until I was about 13, and after reading it, it just wasn't that good. If I put on my child-like lens, then yes, I would say it's nice. Unfortunately, my views on the book is altered because I read it as a young adult. I would recommend it to children. It's very simple and not that long, so you might find it enjoyable."
1,Bland,"I don't know what is up with the Entrepreneur-magazine series of books, but I've read several of them now and I've yet to be impressed with any of them. The best way to describe this book...BLAND AND FULL OF FLUFF. Most of them are apparently written by people who have NO real-world business experience. They are not recommended."
5,Hilarious Movie Novelization,"One Christmas Eve, while Santa Claus is visiting a children's orphanage, Buddy, a tiny baby, crawls into Santa's sack while looking for a stuffed teddy bear, and ends up being taken back to the North Pole, where he is kept, and raised by elves. Thirty years later, at 6'2, Buddy still believes that he is truly an elf. That is, until his adoptive elf father tells him the truth, that he is actually a human, and that his biological father lives in New York City, but is also on the naughty list. Buddy decides to set off to find his father, and to not only convince him that he is his son, but also to help him make the big leap from the naughty list to the nice list.After seeing the movie ELF, I just had to read the movie novelization. Identical to the movie, this book will offer laughs for children and adults of all ages, as they follow Buddy on his crazy adventures all over New York City. A must-have novelization for the holiday season, or any time of the year.Erika Sorocco"
4,"The ""Oreo Gang"" fights back","Strapped for cash, three blue collar automotive workers decide to turn the tables on their corrupt union. Zeke (Richard Pryor) is being hounded by the IRS, Jerry (Harvey Keitel) has a daughter in need of braces, and Smokey (Yaphet Kotto) needs to support his wild lifestyle. So they don some dime store disguises and rob the union - but all doesn't end well. Film starts out with uproarious comedy, but then gets dark and serious - and dangerous. The performances (especially Pryor's) are excellent, and Paul Schrader's debut film is definitely worth a look."
3,bought as gift,Was gift for friend who couldn`t find in store.Remember watching the movie many years ago but for myself wouldn`t be buying
2,foul language,"Too much foul language. It put me off following the plot. I have never known people to speak like that. Have a friend that worked on a GM assembly line, speaks real English."
5,Fluffy Positioning bolster,The service was excellent and the product met my expectations. My only comment is it would be niceif they made the product that also has harder foam inside. but I ordered this product and the descriptionand final product received were the same.
3,"Good show, Bad price","I really love the Justice League cartoon. It retained much of the character and charm of Batman: The Animated Series, while exposing viewers to a wider array of stories and personalities. I recommend the series to anyone who like heroes and comics. It's good for kids from early teen years on up.Unfortunately this 2-pack of DVDs is a bit of a bad deal. At the time I'm writing this it is priced at $80.99, a full $15 or so more than the 2 season sets individually. Why it is priced that high I have no idea.Do yourself a favor and check out those individual sets first to see which is the better deal, OK?Justice League - Season One (DC Comics Classic Collection)Justice League - Season Two (DC Comics Classic Collection)If you like them the 2 seasons of the follow-up series Justice League: Unlimited are available in a set at a much more reasonable price of $45.99, as of this writing, too.Justice League Unlimited, Seasons 1-2 (DC Comics Classic Collection)Enjoy!"
3,No Way.,"I love the series, and I own Justice League Unlimited, but there's no way I'm paying 80 bucks for this."
2,Outrageous Cost,"As with other DC animated combo packs, this appears to be just the individual box sets of seasons 1 and 2 sold together-but for a much higher price than purchasing them separately?The individual boxed Justice League seasons currently sell for approximately $25 each (USD). I have not been able to find any special features listed in the combo pack product description that would justify a $30 increase (from $50 to $80 USD) from the cost of purchasing both seasons separately.I highly recommend both Justice League and its successor, Justice League Unlimited. This is a great animated show with better-than-usual writing, casting, and art direction, but I would recommend you save $30 and buy the two seasons separately rather than in this over-priced combo pack."
1,So lame,"This movie was bad. The acting of the main male vampire was so lame, he looked like he was trying too hard. The rest of the ""vampire clan"" was ok, with the exception of the main female character IMO she acted well. The parents were also bad. The only reason why I watched this movie was because it is based on a true story. The movie doesn't explain very much at all. I would have liked to know more, like why did they think they were vampires, why did they follow this lame guy around, etc. Do not watch this movie, I suspect reading about the real story would be more interesting."
1,"Bad story, good Drew","Note: Like others, I didn't feel like registering, but I'm 20.I thought this movie was ridiculous. I want to say it was unbelievable, except it supposedly really happened. Nevertheless, I thought the whole thing was quite silly, and the plot really boring. It doesn't capture your attention at all. Drew Fuller, however, was amazing as usual. If you are a Drew fan, go for it. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,Vampire Clan,"Based on a true story, this movie is about a group of teenagers that needlessly murder their friend's parents and steal their automobile, but you already know that. In the movie, the girl is telling the story...but then, how would she know what the guys were doing when she wasn't there? I gave my rating as three stars, because I think it is uninteresting and insipid, albeit it has some aspects that would delight others' tastes in flicks."
1,Please read before purchase....,"First I'd like to say that, not only is this movie as low budget as it get's, the dvd format used doesn't even work in all dvd players. Luckily I rented this before I bought it, and was able to get my money back. If you want a movie that is sumized in ten minutes but then takes the rest of the movie to replay that ten minutes over and over and over..... then this is the movie for you. This makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" look like the best movie ever made. It felt like I was watching a really, really long episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"". If this rating system had negative stars I would give it a negative 5 stars."
2,Needed different cast,"For those people watching this for fun, sure the movie might be okay. For those of us who knew some of the people involved, the movie is very far from the truth. The actors and actresses did good jobs, but they were not casted very good and did not portray the actually people. Did have some truth to the story, but there was also a lot missing."
5,Awesome movie.,"This movie was great. Sure, it doesn't go into the full details of the story, but it's a MOVIE, made to ENTERTAIN, not to inform, necessarily. Drew Fuller did an excellent job as Rod, and actually made him alluring instead of what he was - ""an underweight greasy teenager from a dysfunctional family that spent far too much time playing role playing games and smoking weed,"" as another reviewer said. Personally, I really enjoyed the movie - it reminded me of an indie film in a sense, and it's really very sensual and visually stimulating.(Note: I'm not really twelve. I just put that so I wouldn't have to sign up with the site.)"
1,it stinnnnnnnnnks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game is so stupid everything looks like it is from a broken video camera! please don't buy.
2,Not what you think.,"This book is very technical and not a basic beginner's guide to backyard astronomy. But, if you want to understand the technical aspects of how a telescope works then it's for you."
3,"Dated, but contains lots of hard to find information.","Originally published in 1955, this reprint is of the 3rd (1971) edition. In our era of out-of-the-box Go-to telescopes, these details of the English mounting and aberrations in a doublet lens may seem hopelessly dated. Yet there is lots of information here that is hard to find elsewhere. How much magnification is enough? How much is too much? Elsewhere you can find a rule of thumb; here you can find eight rules compared and evaluated. Sidgwick derives many formulae from the basic physics of light; he gets into the details of how vision works; he gives a more detailed analysis of 'seeing' than any other I've read.3 stars for the average amateur; 5 for the amateur telescope maker or anyone looking to tinker with equipment."
3,LIttle Walter - Quater to Twelve,"This album has many of Little Walters classic thick toned harp hits but this was recored a little slow and sounds flat. So if you are a harp player, forget playing along with the CD. Other than that this would be a great CD with a few extra cuts that I haven't seen on other CD's. ""Who"" is a great number that really has great vocal pharsing that makes it a bit different than the standard. All the other songs can be found on the other CD's and I would recommend them over this one."
4,"""confessin' the blues"" is the best of little walter.","""confessin' the blues"" is the best of little walter. this cd may be good for those of you who has already had ""confessin' the blues""."
4,Good Game,I purchased this game to use at my daughters upcoming bridal shower. But when I received it I found out that I also would be to use it a my daughter-in-laws baby shower. What a find!It came with in the time frame stated and in excellent condition.I am sure that we will have fun playing Bridal Shower Bingo and Baby Bingo at both of the upcoming Showers.
3,"Good acting, poor writing, beautiful people","I wouldn't call this movie great but it's an OK thriller. Thank goodness this movie has the beautiful Diane Lane nude but without violence. I easily give her 5 stars but the storyline barely gets 1 star for an overall average of 3. There are too many unbelievable situations here that could have played out OK with a little more character development in the writing. As it's written we are led to believe that she arrives new in town, gets off the bus at a department store, walks in with some drawings and gets the job as the window dresser. (Maybe her beauty did it). In another scene after the pervert calls her many times, breaks into her apartment, etc. etc, etc. she meets him alone on a dark railroad bridge at night to talk with him. Is this reality??? Nice acting, beautiful people, dream like photography but unreal writing summarizes this movie."
2,Humble Beginnings for Diane Lane,"Diane Lane stars at Katya, a window dresser for a big city department. However, her displays are borderline erotica, and she unintentionally attracts the attention of Jack, a married man who has developed an obsession with Katya as he believes her displays are speaking to him, telling him of her wanton desires for him. Inevitably, Katya tells Jack's wife about him, cracking his madness wide open into homicidal rage.Next to some of the erotic scenery in this video flick, Diane Lane is (as always) the only thing watchable. Everything else is formula ... watered down."
4,"Great movie, worn out VHS.","This is one of those movies that I was hoping to add to my funky favs library. Unfortunately, it is only available on VHS and not available NEW. The tape I received was damaged and had to be returned. Maybe, I will try again sometime."
2,lady beware,i know that the vhs tape is old but it was in poor condition parts of the movie were garbled
3,IT'S GREAT!!,"Thilling movie!!! On the ""Risque"" side, but I was entertained. Diane Lane is a wonderful actress. The end of the movie is GREAT!!! Gail M. McGuire...Peace On Earth!!!"
4,Interesting and Captivating,"I picked the book out of instinct, and then read it without any expectation. Indeed it's a very interesting book. Actually it has fascinating surprise elements, even more so if you hadn't read the reviews here!This is a story of a mother's love for her son, and how the pair cope with an unexpected twist of life. Captivating, for getting us to take a peek at how someone like John deals with his new life, someone like Sonja perceives things, and someone like Joan handles it all.The alternating narrative reminds me of the book ""Mendel's Dwarf"". Such a style of narration risks being confusing, but at the same time triggers our curiosity."
4,Detailed Metal Plane & Nice Playable Size.,"My 8 year old son loves this B-17 & his B-25. Both are not small like most you come across in this price range; yet, they are not too big to play with. They hold up very well except for obviously the propellers eventually being broken off by young children. However, with or without propellers, he plays with them often. Both are very detailed & could be used for models as well; you would want to keep them on the platform since the wheels are not extractable."
4,A Well-Structured Book to Explore Who You Are as an Investor,"This book explores systematically the common types of investors: conflicted, depressed, revenging, masked, fussy and paranoid.You will benefit from exploring the type of investor you are with the help of the classification and the cases.IMPORTANT: As the authors put in the Preface, this book will neither tell you how to trade nor show any trend-based investing strategy. But it helps you explore how your character, attitude, biases and the like affect greatly on your investing decisions (and results).Be prepared to take time to digest the book as it contains psychological issues (such as dream, defense mechanism, etc.) which might seem abstract. But I am sure that the time you invested pays off!"
4,"Easy as 1,2, and 3","After taking everything I needed to out! It took less than 10 minutes to get the old one out and the new one in! I've been driving my truck for a month and have driven about 5,000 miles! I drive long distances and the only diffrence I noticed was the temp climbed a little when climbing a steep grade. When I installed the pump I noticed the blades on the new pump were not the same as stock. They were not as aggressive. Othere than that it has worked well! I will update this when needed!"
1,Worst movie ever,This movie was not a good movie at all!!!!! Don't waste your money on this! !! 11 year olds try to act gangster it is just so stupid:(
3,Young Grand-daughter's favorite,"I bought this as a gift for my grand-daughter for Christmas. We had previously streamed it from NetFlix, and streamed it many times after. She loves musicals, and this was a cute one for her."
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,"srsly its awful total waist of time, it was free for me but i only got through the first 15 minuets im sorry but it sucked"
1,WORST MOVIE OF 2010,EVERY SINGLE 5 STAR REVIEW IS FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE FILM. DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS TERRIBLE. STAY AWAY!
5,"Great book, great memories","Greg Cielec's My Cleveland Story was wonderful. He captured a piece of Cleveland that will make readers feel like they are there and experiencing those things too! Although I am now living away from Cleveland, I was swept up in the emotion and memories of the past and home when reading his book. Any Clevelander will appreciate the aura the book provides of home. Any out of towner will love learning about Cleveland through Greg's eyes. He depicts the sights, sounds and feel of Cleveland through his story. If anyone wants to read a superb novel about growing up and overcoming the adversities of what life brings, Greg's novel is your best choice to do so. If you want to read a romantic, suspenseful and memorable novel - pick his story up today!!"
5,A Cleveland Classic,"""My Cleveland Story"" is a great book! A fantastic story that follows two best friends, set in Cleveland in ""the good ol' days"" as well as the two friends' respective college campuses. Paints a vivid picture of growing up: high school football, first loves, graduation, college, returning home. As the author writes, ""it was the golden age, before HIV but after crabs"".Definitely pick this one up if you get the chance!"
1,That's disgusting,"this is coming from a person that personally knows mr. cielec. he is a cool guy but I really didn't need to know about all his sexual experiences. the graphicness about his loads, chubbies, and other sexual terms wasn't anything I cared about. If he had left all this stuff out it would have been better, And by the way go caveliers and to mr. cielic (yes I mispelled it) please don't tell me any more about your chubbie."
3,A Taste of Home!,"Greg Cielec's first novel really brought back memories for me, even though I grew up in Cleveland during the '80's.I became attached to two of the main characters, Mate and Beth, and their story was very real. I felt like Greg, writing in the first person, wasn't really as much a part of the story as I would have liked him to be.Greg brought the Catholic school expecience to life, as well as a pretty typical college life. I can remember some pretty wild days at my college! I felt that the football scences were too detailed, but overlooked them, as in Greg's real life, he is a football coach.Although the scences, the food, the music, all reflect Cleveland, I think that adults that grew up in the mid-west during the '70's and '80's would appreciate the story. Also, as realistic as it is, our youth would get a kick out of our good 'ole days.Enjoy this easy read. I did! I am looking forward to Greg's second novel."
4,excellent - thought provoking - inventive,"What does one do with a library that goes AWOL? with books that do/don't create a universe with/against the reader? that creates its own order independent of the library owner? letters that sit in a heap independent of the order that the author tried to impose? Through a narrative that explores these and other questions regarding the relationship between reality-book-reader, Martin Nakell has written a novella that enthralls a reader in snare of inconsistencies in our relationship to the written word.Nakell's interest in the disordered letters contrasts with Jabes' interest in the margins, the space between letters. Of the two Nakell is the easier read, Jabes is a greater challenge to one's values. So read both :-)"
3,Nothing Bad -- Nothing Good,"This book is really random. It doesn't teach anything but some vocabulary which is random and a little coungting. I dont think it is worth the price at all and I cant even put my faith in the upper levels of this series being any good, I mean, what are they going to offed with this format thats going to make LVL 2+ more useful?"
4,Synthax unleashed,"This is the release that fully introduced Holdsworth's Synthax, and what a treat it is. I saw a video of his concert in Tokyo few years back at which he played the Synthax, and it is truly a unique instrument that Alan perfected later in ""Sand"" and ""Wardenclyffe Tower."" As usual, he is masterful in developing an aural landscape into which he pulls our imagination. I have often told friends that he ""speaks"" to me in his solos. The length of the CD is rather short, but all of the traks are gems and it is a ""must have"" for Holdsworth fans. I would have paid twice the price to have it in my collection.Alexander May"
3,Ear fatigue: the Synthaxe ruins it for me,"While there are some great improvisations and compositions, why did Holdsworth who possesses one of the most distinctive and beautiful guitar tones in jazz choose to make his guitar sound like a cheesy '80's era synthesizer? I suppose for 1986 the synthaxe (essentially a guitar shaped synth trigger) was the very apex of technology, but today it sounds badly dated and gimmicky, yuck. There is some beautiful playing on this album and not every solo is a synthaxe adulterated one, thank god. Atavachron isn't really a bad album as far as the compositions and playing are concerned. But there's little warmth due to the dated sounding and mechanically cold synthesizers, not to mention Chad Wakerman's incredibly annoying and also badly dated electronic drums. If you're new to Allan Holdsworth don't start here."
1,MOST DULL BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"I had to read this book for science class and it was HORRIBLE!!! Not only was the plot too simple and childish, but the explanations for the science and math concepts are like textbook excerpts. We needed to take a quiz about the book at the end, and to prove how much it taught us, all of the questions were about things that weren't even mentioned (the teacher probably couldn't find anything)! NEVER READ THIS BOOK EVER, NOT EVEN FOR A LAUGH!!"
1,It Just Isn't Well Written,"The concept of the book is interesting, however, it is contrived and uninteresting. It's fairly good for a book that is written by a teenager but it's not professional quality.The story is forced and the dialogue is trite. It feels as though the author used a thesaurus extensively so that, instead of using the most appropriate word, she just used a word that she hadn't before. To a great deal math and science concepts were not used in a way that helped increase the reader's understanding.I was unable to finish the book and it didn't keep my children's (7, 11, 13 and 16 year olds) attention well at all."
1,dans le Caniveau!,"This French movie, originally entitled ""La Lune dans le Caniveau"", was released in 1983. Jean-Jacques Beineix also directed/co-wrote ""Diva"" (1981). I loved Diva, so I had to see this film, especially because it starred Gérard Depardieu & Nastassja Kinski! Egads. This was the WORST movie I had EVER seen. (...) There may be some deep meaning, but I didn't get it. The cinematography was supposedly stylish & noir, but I must have missed it for being so bored. (Apparently the whole thing was shot in a studio.) ""Diva"" had a plot and great characters to carry along its style and meaning; ""Moon in the Gutter"" didn't."
5,Great!,"I don't know if I wold be willing to leave bags of blood at the bookstore, like the previous reviewer suggested, but it's a great book. Everyone should read it!"
1,Give me a break!,"This isn't really a novel, it's more like a book length collection of semi-comic bits. Despite massive hype it quickly and rightfully went out of print when it came out and it's amazing to me that it was reprinted. The author, his friends and former students have managed to give this tedious read five stars, but believe me you'd be wasting time, money and paper if you picked up a copy. AIDS is a tragic, terrible problem, but silly books like this that use the disease to appropriate some drama and gravity only trivialize the situation."
2,Drips!,"I have been looking for a glass 2-quart pitcher and they're surprisingly difficult to find with a lid. Found this at Wal-Mart much cheaper, as did another reviewer. I agree with the other person that this is NOT an effecient use of space. I could deal with that, but I can't deal with the fact that when your pour, it drips and runs all down the side and onto whatever surface it is over. Not so bad when it gets to the bottom, but when pitcher is full, it's a big mess. I don't recommend it."
3,"Good value, but has some flaws","I bought 2 of these at Walmart today. I'm not thrilled with the design because it's not an efficient use of space, but I have been having trouble finding any kind of large glass beverage container that has a lid. I paid <$5 each for mine, so that was also a plus.Well I got it home and now I realize that my hand won't fit in it to clean it (I'm an average sized woman with fairly thin hands). If I'm diligent about rinsing it out I can probably get buy with a scrub brush, but if anything ever dries in there so that it requires elbow grease, I'm sunk."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"I have finally decided to get rid of mine online. I feel the same as the one reviewer who can't get her hand inside of the pitcher to clean it. It is also impossible for the water to get inside even in a dishwasher. Therefore, it is never sanitized. I will continue looking for a covered pitcher that has a more practical design."
2,Beware,I had a couple of these jugs and one broke. Can't find the locally so searched Amazon. The one I bought was listed as a set of 4 (as it should be for the price of $20) and I only received one. Sending the jug back. Hard to find a good sealing tea container and this has worked well for several years. I would recommend if you can find them for a decent price but $20+ is ridiculous.
3,Nice glass but design flaws,"I've had mine for years. It is made of thick sturdy glass, which is what I like about it. There are 2 things I don't like about it: 1) holding it by the neck to pour is awkward, especially when full; 2) it always drips a lot down the side, which is messy and annoying. If I didn't have a dishwasher, I would have to add a 3rd disadvantage of the neck being too small to fit my hand in. I still use it because for some reason, good glass pitchers with lids are hard to find."
5,Edition 1 - Soda Lovers Value Package,"I don't think this combination is available via Amazon, but you can get it from the Soda Club web site. Anyway, it arrived today, less than a week after I ordered it. I was a bit surprised by the size of the thing, but when you see the size of the CO2 cartridge, you understand why it is so tall. It was well packaged with clear instructions. I swiftly rinsed and filled my four bottles with water and threw them in the fridge. A couple of hours later, when the water was cold, I made my first bottle of Lemon/Lime soda. It tasted great and I'm looking forward to trying more flavors. One tip: stay a bit below the fill line. I took my two bottles to the line a got a bit of splash back while filling (I may have held the button down too long)."
3,"Machine is great... Soda Flavors, well?","The machine works great, easy to use. But the regular soda flavors so far are kind-of, well Yuck! The diet and fruit flavors seem drinkable. Maybe it's just my tastebuds. I did try using Crystal Light ""On The Go"" packets, raspberry ice, now that was good. I recommend people also try some of those other ""water bottle"" flavoring products as well. Product looks good on the counter."
5,Great product! Buy IT!!,"For Environmental reasons alone this Soda Machine is worth every penny. You can use the bottles for 3 years before they suggest you replace it. Yes you can recycle cans and bottles from the store however recycling takes resources.I purchased the Edition 1 Soda Machine with the Value Kit directly from the manufactures website. The Kit included the Soda Maker, 3 carbonators, 4 bottles, 8 syrup bottles, and 12 sample syrups. The Soda Machine works perfect however some of the syrups are just ok. Ginger Ale, Pete's Choice and Lime flavors are great. Root Beer and Grapefruit (Squit) are ok. Stay away from Grape which tastes like cough syrup.Besides the grape flavored syrup I have no complaints. If you only drink one soda a day I would still recommend this machine. It will eventually save you money and help the environment.As a side note it did take over a week to receive, but that is to be expected since it does include compressed gas which has to be delivered ground by UPS."
5,Dave H,"""The Anome"" by Jack Vance. After a brief respite from reading Jack Vance I'm happy to say I have returned to begin reading his ""Durdane Trilogy"" with ""The Anome"" being the first book. It is remarkable, energizing, and riveting, for the same reasons his other stories are; originality, pacing, atomospheric backdrops, eclectic verbiage, baroque writing style, and brilliantly characterized anti-hero protagonist Gastel Etzwane. Another wonderful journey fashioned from the extraordinary imagination of Jack Vance!"
3,A Short History of Philosophy,"Is not bad, is useful, but it is far from Mage's similar book.The main deficiency is lack of a clear summarizing statement what each philospher specifically contributed that is o lasting value. I it seems that the authors were to shy to present their views even with some understandable reservations. Soometimes one single even small but lasting contribution is worthy mentioning."
4,Good concise history,"To keep this as a short history, the authors of this book tried to keep it around 300ish pages, yet they tried to cover as much as possible of both eastern and western philosophies. Obviously with this difficult task each philosopher is only briefly covered (some with only a few paragraphs). With this speed, I think that many who don't already have a knowledge of philosophy or haven't read some other histories will be confused by the constant introduction of new people. What I did like about this format was that it seemed to make it easier to follow the progression of philosophy through history. I also liked that out of the three history of philosophy books I've read this is the only one that's covered Eastern Philosophies and this was by far the least biased."
5,Excellent Book,"Rotella is a great ethnographer; i'm not a boxing enthusiast but this book exposed me to a deeper side of boxing - a sport where people feel, dream, fail, and persevere. A good read!"
3,"Review of ""The Singers' Manual of English Diction""","This is a well-written book on the phonetics of English diction. It is a good book and contains most but not all the rules and pronunciations of words in the English language. Just like any book involving vocal diction, this book does have variations of pronunciations, but not many. Overall it is a good addition to have in any singers collection."
2,For hahd cases only,"Useful for New Yorkers struggling to overcome their peculiar patois, but more harm than good for singers whose native tongue is already General American English. Marshall fails to distinguish adequately between British English and American English and often preaches the habits of the former as the only proper way to speak and sing. She insists that we should ""never"" -- with ""no exceptions"" -- sing r before a consonant. She would have us sing ""chahm"" instead of charm and ""haht"" instead of heart. She seems unaware that the voicing of post-stress intervocalic t's is standard in America, Canada, Ireland, and Australia. Regarded as the bible by pedantic choir directors who know music but not English, this book is perhaps responsible for two generations of annoyingly unnatural articulation by amateur singers."
4,Good overall,The text is helpful for those involved in learning singers' diction. It would be much more beneficial to students if the author included IPA within the text.
4,Almost perfect,"This little standard text for vocalists leaves very little out. The only issues I might have is in the detail that is sometimes given, but not necessary (some times, it's just way too picky). Also, it would be helpful to have a workbook or problems used as examples. Other than that, it's about the best you can buy."
2,Sadly Not Originals,"Bobby is a great artist, and these are not bad versions of some of his best known tracks. But please check out the originals you wont be dissapoimted."
4,almost 5 stars,"this is a short review because it's my dinner time. this is one of my best house cds (i also have bob sinclair, daft punk, basement jaxx, ian pooley, cassius, santos, st. germain, etienne de crecy, les rithmes digitales...). best songs are Contact (just listen to the bass in this instrumental track), You can't change me (classic vocal house a la armand van helden - you don't even know me), The partee (latin american. ever heard of the heartists - belo horizonti (author claudio coccoluto, remix by basement jaxx)? this is sort of similar), I never knew. the others are pretty good so there's no reason for not buying this"
4,Good companion book,"I really like how this book is set up, the author brings up some poignant questions that are very interesting. I also like how the author introduces each section. It is nice that there is a check-mark next to each section so you can keep track of what you have read if you like to skip around. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to study the bible in a group or by themselves."
2,2000 SERVER EXAM CRAM,"I have taken and passed the 2k server exam, no thanks to exam cram though. There were errors in this book. I would contribute the most fault in this book to the lack of difficulty compared to the actual exam. The exam integrates what used to be separate exams into this one. Coverage on both the exam prep and exam cram lack any real substance. Most of the labs are weak. Coverage on terminal services, installations and upgrades and remote access are virtually non existant in these books, but are covered heavily in the exam. Beware of relying on these books for any exam preparation. They are, however, a good introduction to the subjects presented in other good books which is why I give it 2 stars."
1,Worst Exam Cram book ever,"I am a big fan of the Exam Cram seris, but this is the worst publication I have read to date. It has countless typo's and technical errors. It needs to be replaced. Do not waste your money on this one."
2,Not Impressed,"This particular Exam Cram book (Windows 2000 Server) is very underwhelming. I found the book to be a highlight of some of the important features of Windows 2000 Server, but provided little or no depth. I realize that this is a 'cram' book, but it still is not good preparation for the 70-215 exam--even to just complement your other preparation. The practice questions at the end of each chapter and the practice exam at the end of the book were not very similar to actual test questions, either in level of difficulty or material tested. In short, there are better ways to spend both your time and money in preparing for the actual exam."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I have used a number of exam cram books in the past as cert exam prep tools and I was very happy with them but this particular book is very poorly written, alerts that the reader about knowing certain concepts but does not cover or explain the subject concepts, and also has a number of editorial mistakes.I certainly would not recommend using this book as a exam aid or for refere.nce"
1,Don't buy it!,"I don't see how anyone could give this book a good rating, and its unfortunate that here at Amazon's site the first couple of reveiws that you see on this book fawn about how great it is. I used the Exam Cram series for all of my NT tests and thought that they were great, so I purchased this book without hestation, what a big mistake! I know that the Exam Crams are a ""CRAM"", I don't expect the book to explain everything in detail or cover all material and subjects starting with ""Computing 101"" but the book was more like an index pointing you to areas where you should study for the exam. There was almost nothing of substance in the book itself!I have been building 2000 Servers for about 4 months, I also used some on-line study guides, and practice tests in addition to the Exam Cram. I passed the test but I realized that the Exam Cram book didn't help me AT ALL!"
2,Use Extreme Caution,"This is by far the worst Exam Cram Book I have ever purchased. I can say worst, because I would normally rank any book from Exam Cram as either Excellent or very close to that. If you are at all interested in passing Exam 70-215 on your first attempt, then I strongly suggest avoiding this book.First of all, it's riddled with errors. Additionally, the coverage of key exam topics is far from in-depth. This made the book into more of an annoying companion rather than a critical exam preparation tool. I strongly recommend seeking out other sources of study material to make up for what this book lacks in detail and coverage."
2,"Great Outline, No Depth","This book did not meet my expectations. With the realization that an ""Exam Cram"" cannot go into too much depth, I would use this material as a study outline only. This book will give you 1) an understanding of terminology used in the exam, 2) a checklist of what should be covered, and 3) overall concepts you should be familiar with. However, it did NOT help me with any complex or performance-oriented questions (which made up the majority of the exam). I was grateful to have purchased Transcender materials, as well as the Sybex and Syngress books for this Exam. I did pass, but not with much help from this Exam Cram.As a side note, I was increasingly annoyed by the considerable amount of spelling, syntax, and data errors I found repeatedly throughout this book."
2,Definitely not as good as other exam crams,"I used an Exam Cram book as my primary reference for studying for exam 70-210, Windows 2000 Professional. When I did that exam, I did quite well. Therefore, I was quite impressed with that book.As a result, I decided to also use another Exam Cram book as my primary reference for exam 70-215, Windows 2000 Server. It was almost a mistake. I passed my 70-215 exam yesterday, but just barely.Fortunately for me, in both cases, I supplemented the exam cram books with other materials. The 70-215 book is fairly well organized, has a reasonably good outline, and is easy to read. Maybe too easy. This book has some shortcomings. It is missing a lot of material that is actually on the exam. If I had used it as my only study guide, then I would have failed for certain!"
4,"Helpful, but not enough by itself","I took 70-215 yesterday and scored 880/1000. The ExamCram did a good job of summarizing the main objectives and was good as a concise review. However, it is not enough by itself to pass the test (nor is it positioned to be).I felt that even thought the ExamCram isn't supposed to be as in depth as a 600+ page book, it still could have gone into more detail in a few areas, such as trouble shooting RRAS.I'd recommend this book as a supplement to another method of study, but not as the sole method."
4,New Cities & New Heroes Make This Book a Winner!,"I couldn't put this book down! I loved that it took place in Atlanta rather than NY or DC. Laura Chastain is a believable protagonist as she makes mistakes and has hang-ups like the rest of us. The plot was enhanced by real-life legal issues.If you like Grisham, you'll like Kelly!"
3,Strong start - weak finish,"I was very excited when I began reading Kelly's False Witness, but as my interest waned toward the end of the novel, it seems that Kelly's did as well. What started out with believable characters and plot lines, soon turned into something entirely different. Toward the end of her novel, Kelly just wanted to wrap it up for the publishers. What should (and could) have been a solid novel, was ruined with hasty and convenient plot lines, unconvincing moves by the characters, and just plain bad writing by Kelly - not to mention incredibly corny in parts. I do think Kelly is a solid writer, and I am extremely impressed by her knowledge of legal proceedings and loop holes, but I think this novel shows what can happen to a story line when the writer is in a hurry."
3,Very enjoyable,I've read all three of her books (to date) and enjoyed ever one of them. They grab you from page one and hold you till the last line!! I highly recommed them all.
2,Not a great cut for a tank-top,Not such a great cut and not such great fabric (just ordinary t-shirt material ... it's ok)
4,Give this movie a chance....,"Contrary to what other reviews say about this little movie, I love it. I saw it when it first came out, have seen a couple of times since, and recently watched it again on tv. It still held up. It has a quirky style and the surprise ending is wonderful! Tom Hulce is great in it, Virginia Madsen her usual sexy self and I love the little girl who played Bean. It's not a great movie but it does have charm and wit. I hope you give it a try...."
2,Very slow,I don't go to the movies so I don't know how it compares. But this book was boring. The story moved slowly. I don't know what made them decide it was worth making a movie out of it. Don't waste your time.
3,Liked the movie better!,"This was a good read, well-written and compelling. But I had seen the movie when it came out and I thought that was even better done."
4,DOES NOT EQUAL THE MOVIE,"Book is very similar to the movie except for the ending. Jeff Bridges brings the character to life in the movie and the ending of the book is depressing.If I had a choice, the movie is much better."
3,Despair overtakes Vallee,"I admire the research, analytical mind, and public fearlessness with which Vallee attempts to sort the UFO research. In this book he debunks many bunk claims, and for that brings a needed light and rationality to the edge of UFO exploration.And then he blows a fuse.Vallee's research leads him to places that he can't and doesn't want to understand (based on the evidence, who can?). His solution is to postulate a theory of a conspiratorial group(s) trying to confuse those few humans who are aware of the evidence. Isn't this desparate (primitive religious) thinking?I'm a fan of Vallee, but some of his conclusions seem like desparate attempts to put logic and category to phenomena that are completely outside the boundaries of current human thought. Despite the otherwise logical narration and insight into frauds and nuts (good intentions and bad), I simply do not buy his conspiracy to create chaos."
3,Only read once...,"This book provides some basic information about several action figure lines. On the plus side, this book does provide some information and pictures on a few lines that may be hard to find elsewhere (i.e., Big Jim and The Six Million Dollar Man). On the minus side, there is no mention of Star Wars figures, and very little about Mego figures. Further, most of the information that is presented is easily found elsewhere. In short, there are much better books out there about both action figures in general (one of my favorites being ""Tomart's Encyclopedia of Action Figures: The 1001 Most Popular Collectibles of All Time""), and about specific action figure lines (i.e., just Star Wars, just GI Joe, just Mego, just Captain Action, etc.). To be fair, I did enjoy going through this book once, I just haven't found a need to open it again since."
4,A Beautiful Action Figures Book and Reference,"This 2nd edition, 160 page softbound book contains over 400 very large, full color, sharp photos of every type of action figure imagineable. It covers GI Joe, action figures from other countries, Capt. Action, Ken Doll and Friends, Marx, including Johnny West, Vikings and Knights, Buddy Charlie, and Stoney, Kenner, including Boy Scouts and Six Million Dollar Man, Big Jim, Man from U.N.C.L.E., and much more. The guide also includes boxes and accessories. A useful, fun reference for this collectible. Values shown are 1998."
5,this book is the best,"We had to read this book for an English class, and I was thinking ugh, a nonfiction book. We only had to read a handful of articles, but almost everybody in the class read the whole thing. This is truly awesome."
3,Used Hurdles,"This is the second set of 9 inch Kwik Goal hurdles I purchased from Amazon. The hurdles themselves are sturdy and of good quality, but Amazon just sent me a set of hurdles that were clearly used - and probably used for a whole season.The hurdles I received were scuffed up and two of the four hurdles were each missing both plastic end caps which seal the end of the tubes. I had to call Kwik Goal for replacement caps and they were kind enough to send them out gratis. The hurdles are shipped in a very large box and returning them would have been a major headache.This is the second time Amazon has sent me used soccer equipment that came half beat up. If I wanted used sports equipment I'd go to Play it Again Sports. So beware of that issue, but otherwise the hurdles themselves are of very good quality."
5,Painkiller of the new millenium,"Darker than black kickin[]. every song is fast intricate and incredibly catchy. this album is much darker and heavier than the previous album astrology. The vocals on this album are jawdropping as they stretch through nearly every genre of metal.(though somewhere in between Rob Halford and Bruce Dickinson at the norm) The rest of the band is just as good. If you listen to metal you must own this, you will not be dissappointed."
4,......Excellent third release....,"No compromising Power Metal Here just Heavy 80's {without being to retro at all} type metal.This album is better than there first one. The vocals {Sean Peck} are more diverse. Music is harder and faster with great dual guitars with awesome metal riffs.This band has always had that Judas Priest sound like the band Saint, both have stuck to what they do best and that is heavy metal. You know what you get on each new release {that is not always a bad thing}...If you have not bought a Cage album start with this one. I love it and hope they will release another one soon.Darker than Black is a killer song, although there are the dreaded 12 {always keep them wanting more} songs on this CD they are worth it and do not really take away from the cd.An excellent Heavy Metal Album...way to go guys..."
1,Don't buy this flashlight!!!,"This is a battery powered flashlight ONLY!!!!! It is powered by two lithium disc batteries. If you take the batteries out and use the shaking motion to ""charge"" it, it barely gives off any light no matter how long you shake it. Save your money for a good flashlight."
3,It worked until it was dropped,"The flashlight seems to be well-built and it worked good. It got dropped a few times (on tile from 6') and now has some small broken pieces of plastic rattling around on the inside, although the outside still looks great. These pieces get in the way of the coil inside, so it really doesn't work any more as it can't be charged. It does not look like the flashlight is made to take apart.So in my limited experience, a very durable flashlight on the outside with some delicate pieces that can break on the inside, possibly getting in the way of the moving coil.I would still recommend buying it for light use (no pun intended!), as it is a nice unit."
3,flashlight,"The flashlight works well. However, the appearance is not as attractive (for lack of a better word) than other flashlights of the same category and price range. I am aware that appearance does not equate to performance so thus far I am pleased with the flashlights. Have only used them for about 10 days since they were Christmas gifts."
1,Don't even consider this produce,"I was VERY disappointed with the Newline Well Balance scale! I took itout of the box, removed the tabs on the batteries, and it didn't work. Icalled the company for assistance and someone answer without identifying the company but said he was able to help. He suggested that I insert paperunder the battery cover to improve contact. It turned on ONCE but not again. Amazon only offers refunds for products from Wintime, the company that sells Newline, because their stock changes so often. That should tell you something! I haven't found a replacement yet, but it certainly won't be a Newline or Wintime product."
2,drop it to turn it on,The instructions actually tell you to lift the scale with your big toe and drop it get it going. But even this didn't work that well. I'm not sure my downstairs neighbors will appreciate me dropping the scale every time I want to use it.
2,Different reading every time,"I've weighed myself on three separate occasions over the last ten minutes, and I've stepped on and off about three or four times in each of those instances. The first time I read 127, second time? 127.4. Third time I weighed 127.2. Unacceptable."
4,"Digital scale is attractive, easy to use","Purchased as a second scale for use at beach house. Reads 1.4 lbs heavier than our original (booh!) but is attractive, easy to read. Turning the scale on is harder than expected -- we do a little toe lift of the unit and it seems to work better than the tap called for in the directions. Would purchase again."
5,Great scale!,This scale rules...very accurate readings. You just have to lift it up slightly with your foot and set it back down to turn it on. Highly recommended.Update after 4 years: the scale is still working as well as ever after 4 years of near-daily use by two pretty heavy people.
1,UNpleasantly surprised,"Imagine my surprise when I stepped onto this scale for the first time and it informed me that I had gained 20 lbs in 4 days. I trust the previous reading since it was at the beginning of my annual physical. So I tested it against four other scales, all which were within 4 pounds of the Doctor's scalle. The final straw came when a guest used it and found, to her chagrin, that she had gained 22.5 lbs during her nine hour road trip from Flagstaff to Los Angeles."
4,Great!!,"This is a great scale. It looks great, and works well also,I have had no issues with it. My only concern is, if there is no way to recalibrate the scale if ever the need arise."
4,Good Base Scale,"My first digital scale and I found it to work great. The detailed weighing of .2 lbs made it easy to see the fluctuations of my weight throughout the day. I felt the responses of my diet and workouts and saw them on the scale. Its great for motivating. You normally tap the scale with your foot, let it set and then get on. Occasionally the tap doesn't work and you just lift it with your toe.The only problem I experienced was battery life. Though I was using it on a daily basis."
4,ok bathroom scale,"The accuracy is ok, but one have to remember this is not a professional scale. If you do 3 measurements in a row you won't get the exact same weight but it's pretty close and you can do an average. After all our body weight has small variations during the day, so an average will work. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that the slight tap to start it..... it doesn't work. Mine starts by lifting one side about 2 inches from the floor and let it drop. Sound awfull but... after 2 months still working. Let's hope for the best. It's still my money but it didn't cost a fortune. Want a more accurate and gentle scale?... pay the price.So, good looking, sturdy (so far) and inexpensive."
5,Great scale Reasonably priced,"Design is modern, simple yet nice and sleek. Has Kg or pounds which my european wife likes. Accurate. Only had it for a week now so can't attest to longevity but so far so good, glad we ignored the negative reviews."
4,Works great,Unit seems durable so far and gives accurate weight. Sometimes takes multiple tries to get it to activate.
5,"bought over a year ago, still works great","I bought this scale over a year ago and it still works great! Turning it on is a bit of a trick... I either lift up the upper right foot about a centimeter off the floor then drop the scale, or I push the scale sideways across the linoleum and the friction on the floor turns it on. I've had no problem with the accuracy and it cleans very well. I would recommend this scale to anyone looking for one!!"
5,Very well written acount of the Corsair testing and development,"It was very enjoyable read, with detail and well written. Anyone interested in the development of one of the finest and longest produced fighters of WW2 and Korea would find this fascinating."
2,THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S A TALE OF GENGHIS KHAN,"Book was old, smelly, torn and in poor condition. First time a purchase from Amazon was in such bad shape.Will purchase from Amazon again in the future, but if next purchase is this bad, we will not use Amazon again."
5,Enchanting!,"It's everything I've come to expect from Ellen Dugan. Informative, witty and creative. Who knew there was so much to learn about cats?"
5,My Favorite Cat Magick Book!,"I've read a few cat books regarding spells, mysticism, magicks and what not. I also practice a bit of it. This is my favorite book, it gives a bit of everything that one would want to know about cats. History, Goddesses, spells, charms, candles, herbs, crystals, quotes, stories, astrology, elements, feline powers, working magick with your cat, all in one well laid out book. I love it and would recommend it to anyone who's curious about cat magick or has studied it for awhile."
5,I only wish I could have a cat...,I am a big fan of Ellen Dugan and have read most of her books. I love this book and am on my second read! I only wish I could have a cat but I am one of those who is allergic to the feline companion. Good job Ellen! I love the book!
3,The cover picture is enchanted,"I like the format, rituals, lore, and information in all of Dugan's other books. As a cat lover I was eagerly awaiting this book. I settled in for a good evening of reading, but was disapointed. There wasn't much relevant or interesting in this book. Cat tarot, cat zodiac signs, Feng Shui with your cat... it just wasn't what I was hoping for. Cover is cool!"
1,Ripped Off,Ordered 2 bottles.Paid for 2 bottles.Received only 1 bottle in the mail.What can be done about this shortage?
3,Directions?,"I'm glad this arrived on time, but someone put a sticker over the directions so I'm not really sure what they are. Something about 4 times a day.. one four times a day? I guess that's what I'll do, but it does annoy me that someone would put a sticker over the one part of the bottle they shouldn't."
3,"Moving, with restraint....","I thought this novel was quite touching and poignant. Leavitt writes with empathy and is able to delve into the different perspectives of each character. He employs restraint in his writing yet it effectively brings out the emotion of the story.However I thought that this reserved style may be hampering at times, for example the part where the family just witnessed the passing away of Louise. I was surprised that Leavitt didn't explore their emotions further on a deeper level other than just shedding tears; maybe because everyone, including Leavitt himself, was getting a bit tired of Louise's sickness by this stage that no one has the energy for much introspection. I just felt this part was rather 'wooden'.But by and large, this is an engrossing novel and a good read. The weaving of the characters' lives was well developed and the non-linear progression was a good complement to the story."
3,50 / 50 Chance You'll Enjoy It,"Not a bad read. The storyline kept me intersted; however I'm not sure if that was because I kept thinking that there wourld be some really profound emotional connection with Danny and/or April on the next page. . . ., but it never happened. By the time I finished the book I felt neither cheated out of my time nor extremely rewarded for the effort. We'll see how the next book by Leavitt works for me."
2,Environmental bees,"I read this for second time, and the first time I got it at a used book store. It was actually different. I remember how the ""old"" book started, and how it ended. This one was somewhat different. I think this was rewritten from Project 40? Herbert is still the most supreme writer of science and science fiction."
2,Agents and Insects,"This probably worked better as a short story. Hellstrom's Hive is a 1950's, cold war sci-fi tale, nothing more, nothing less. A few grotesque situations in the hive are memorable, the ""stumps"" for example, but the endless pages of the Agency going through the motions is just plain mind numbing. Pass."
4,Painful beauty,"This Cd is so intense that it is almost physically painful to listen to it. Sadness seems to materialize and take on a body for itself in these songs. It is so beautiful and striking that it will almost hurt you.Highly recommended to those interested in trip-hop and its subgeneres, although Devics could hardly be labelled as trip-hop. People who enjoy Alpha, Portishead or Royskopp, might enjoy this, although the electronic edge is almost neutralized here. The only way I can find to describe the Devics style is filtered trip-hop: take all the electronica influence out and leave the core of transcendental melodies, and you've got Devics.Not for the faint of heart."
2,The good and the bad so wish it was not mono,"The good: The mix was good very good (if it was not mono)Now the bad: both CD's are well mono QQ. I feel that producing a studio album in mono is very very bad for one it takes way too much from this kind of music its supposed to wrap around you like the sky or space and has a 3D sound not sound dead, flat or 2D. Mono 2D was dead decades ago but certainly holds some quality its not all bad but certainly not his best work.SummerBreeze was so much better even space age 1.0 and 2.0 where better."
5,CLASSIC AS XPECTED,"i know that im one of the few in this country that has been xposed to tiesto's skills. people, u have no idea what ur sleeping on if u dont know about tiesto. hands down, he's the best trance dj ever!!! his new cd, REVOLUTION, is an instant classic in trance world. especially that 90% of the songs are new. its worth well over the $30 that u'll pay. trust me, i was fortunate enough to see him a few times live and this is as close as u'll get to one of his live sets. SO BUY IT NOW!!!!"
1,Tiesto sells out..............,"Rather than featuring trance, which Tiesto has played for several years, he's now dropped that in favor of 'progressive'. Which is basically like techno, monotonous, non-melodic, and dull. But it's the 'in' thing now, so people just rave over it.That's not necessarily a bad thing though, if it were all like that. Since some people like that sort of thing, but he also mixes in a few trance songs, and IMHO, mixing the two simply doesn't work. It didn't work on Tranceport 3, and it doesn't work here.Avoid this like a plague if you like either progressive or trance. It tries to combine both and fails miserably...."
3,Awesome music... but already been done by Tiesto,"I don't really have much to say about this album. DJ Tiesto is awesome, and I really enjoy all of his CDs... but the problem I have with this particular album is that a lot of the tracks are repeats of his other work.If you like Tiesto and want to get accustomed to the type of music he spins, do yourself a favor and get all the In Search of Sunrise CDs, and the Magik CDs, as well as Summerbreeze and Live at Innercity (my personal favorite). Skipping over this wouldn't lose you much if you already have those."
1,Bilge,"The man writes in such an eloquent way that the welfare system needs a progressive makeover by ""allowing"" corporations to adopt an undesigned future system of providing to the community. He neglects to mention how the Ohio Mental Health System will be gutted, immediately upon entering office, to the point of ineffectiveness which will then allow the State the right to shut it down completely. Those who need the services the most will not receive much needed rehabilitation. The type of rehabilitation a corporate trainer or consultant will not be able to provide. A recipe for disaster. I'm sure the man who is the head of the Ohio GOP, the Sec. of State, Gubernatorial candidate, and Supervisor of Ohio Elections (conflict of interest?) felt pressed to get a book out during his campaign because his consultant told him to."
4,All Wound Up CD for kids AND adults,The music is good. But the single best thing about this CD is that it will not wear quickly on parents ears as does most music aimed at children.Depending on your child's exposure to music it will be enjoyed by those about 4 or 5 years old and above.Enjoy!
4,Fun Music,We bought this CD a while ago to have in the car. My 4 year old daughter loves it. She has learned the words to most of the songs and frequently asks to listen to the Mockingbird Polka.
2,Teeth of Terror!,"Two guys are on a get away vacation on a boat and they go crusing around this island for women and sex. Soon, they find this woman whom they both have to share between the two of them or she will leave them both. One night they all go for a swim in the warm waters and suddenly a tiger shark swims up and devours their girl friend alive. I can't remember how the rest of it goes, but watch the movie. Despite the lack of special effects and all, it is probably good for one peek-a-book at."
2,almost worth it for fiona lewis,this is not a very good movie but when i saw fiona lewis walking nude on the beach i about dropped my popcorn. 2 stars just for that. it loses two stars for killing her off so soon.
1,slightly disappointed in DC,"The dress has a lovely cut and I thought it would look great on me. I was disappointed in the fabric and how it layed. Because the dress has a really low back, you need to either go braless or have a good low back bra."
4,"Outdated, yet sound advice","Many of the research methods that Cantor and Schneider discuss here have become outdated. Yet, their advice on writing and thinking about history remains highly applicable to contemporary students studying to become historians."
5,Witty and Intelligent,"The stories in this collection are just fantastic. Pearlman writes with great wit, and the stories are engaging and beautifully written. Some of the stories have a touch (or more) of science fiction, some have a touch of fantasy, and some are just plain eccentric, but they're all superb. Among the best are the title story, which is definitely good for a few laughs, and ""Death in the Des(s)ert"", which is dead serious and very disturbing. I highly recommend this book!"
5,An emotional livid dream,"I've listened to this album on repeat some days, and then have taken long brakes from it. Whenever any of these tracks come up on my ipod's playlist I find myself simply transported into what I would quantify as an emotionally livid dream for the brief length of the track.The melodious album can be cathartic when given complete attention, or it can be an almost beta wave relaxation tool when listened to while working on a taxing project at work."
4,Emma to Lisa,I bought this because I'm a Lush fan but any other Sing Sing purchases will be because I've become a fan of Lisa O'Neill's voice. Just loverly. Emma provides the right pop guitar sensibility that's needed.
2,Complete Letdown,"I'm torn. My main problem with this book is the unoriginal plot twist upon which the book (and specifically its ending) is based. But since this is a novelization of a movie script, this can't be blamed on Steven Piziks. For the most part, this is a well-written novelization and very cinematic, but the characters never really came to life for me. So, do I rate the story or how the novelization was written? I think to be fair, I need to consider both and that's why I only gave this book 2 stars. A quick read at less than 300 pages and a somewhat engaging story, but taking all aspects into consideration, the book falls short. I also thought the excessive use of the f-word was unnecessary. I'm no prude, but the word's usage got to be tedious after a certain point. I do think I will give Steven Piziks another try before striking him from my list of authors to read."
4,good johnny cash sampler,"best of the old cash stuff - a good complement to the recent cash movie, ""walk the line"". i.e. hear what they really sound like.i got a copy and enjoyed it so much that i got a copy for friends in oklahoma who are long-time cash fans. they were most appreciative.some of the oldie cds are of poor quality but this cd was just fine."
5,a must have,"I'll admit, I jumped on the Johnny Cash bandwagon after seeing the movie ""Walk the Line"" Mr. Cash's music had always been a favorite of mine I just never purchased any until I saw the movie. This Cd is one of my best purchases from this site to date. I have been playing it non-stop since I popped it in my disc player. I find-comfort- I would say, in many of his lyrics, not pretentious, or over sang just simply Johnny Cash."
5,Excellent Compilation!,"I originally shopped for the sound track to the movie, but came across this 2 cd collection. This includes all the songs that you heard in the movie, plus many more sung by the original man in black.This is one of those very ""rare"" occasions where you actually buy a cd (in this case 2) where ALL of the songs are good.Highly recommended. So, what are you waiting for? If you don't have this one I suggest you buy it now!"
5,wonderful,service outstandingfast and just as described i will buy from thrift trader againthank you amazon!!!
5,i walk the line in a ring of fire,"what can I say, a very nice compilation of one of America's beloved musicians and yet this is just the tip of the iceberg of some of Johnny Cash's greatest songs, later on in his life he did the American Series which is just utterly awesome (like a fine wine it seemed he just got better, his rendition of Reznor's Hurt, sends goosebumps down your back listening to that deep bass of a voice where Father Time has caught up and sounds rough and croaky, but yet so strangly sublime to hear because this is the man in black, and doing Tom Petty's I won't Back Down is great, and Redemption Song with Joe Strummer I found to be just beautiful, two Legends singing a great song), but for you people who are just getting into this Legend's music, this isn't a bad CD to start off with you get classic hits, get some tracks of him and June Carter Cash, Cash and Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Waylon Jennings--- The Highway Men.Johnny Cash's Music is as American as Apple Pie"
4,Pretty good,"I bought this after seeing ""Walk the Line"". I had forgotten so much about Johnny Cash and enjoyed hearing the earthy man again. I like the selection of songs."
2,untimately boring,The volume was bought to accompany us on a month long road trip. The CD's got one play and were put away for the rest of the journey. The arrangements and instrumentation was repetitive and the voice shows little ability to work outside of a single approach to lyrics. I would have been better served to download the few well know items and forget the rest. Perhaps it will appeal to die hard JC fans but it is like a character actor who can only play one role.
1,SONY CDS ALL HAVE HARMFUL SOFTWARE,only buy this if you never want to put it into your computer. ever.boycott sony.
1,Shipping Nightmare,"The CD is great!!! The legendary Johnny Cash comes thru loud and clear on this CD. However, it took Amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them. Their attitude of ""just wait a few more days and email us again"" was both insulting and annoying. Thank goodness this wasn't a Christmas gift for someone."
1,This isn't country.,"If this guy is so good, how come I never see any of his music videos on CMT? How come he is never on any country music stations? I mean, I listened to his music, and it sounds awful. He does not have the redneck Southern voice all male country singers have, and I don't like it!For some GOOD country, get Rascal Flatts, Carrie Underwood, or Billy Ray Cyrus."
5,Great Collection,Great collection of his music! It has almost all of the songs that were in the movie.
4,The Essential Johnny Cash,"Even though I bought this CD for my 86 year old Mother who is living with me, I also enjoy listening to every song."
5,"If you only have one Cash CD, this is it","If you want one CD set of Cash's, this would be it. Although he has many songs, this is a fine compilation. It reminds me of sitting around a campfire as a kid listening to the Jamboree on the radio out of Wheeling, W. VA. A fine collection."
5,Great includes the classics,"I always wanted a greatest that fitted all the songs I love by Jonny Cash, now this is it. A two disc set of the legendary country singer. With a couple of (live performed)songs such as ""A boy named Sue"",and ""Folsom Prison Blues""Also the classic song ""Ring of Fire"" and ""Ballad of a Teenage Queen"" With ""Men in Black"" and ""I Walk the Line"" also with neat little duet with duet named ""Wanderer""I have always been a fan of Jonny Cash now, I have truly the essentials.Overall: 5/5"
5,where is the sixth star when you need it,"Johnny Cash is one of the most influential musicians of our time. Trying to boil his career down to 2 cds is virtually impossible, yet this set is immensely satisfying. The disc opens with those songs that made Cash a household name;Hey Porter, Cry, Cry, Cry, I walk the Line, Get Rhythm. Each a blinder, each essential not only to understandng Cash's work, but to understanding the development of both rock and country music.All of the major hits are here along with the occasional not well known track like the Wanderer and The Night Hank Williams Came to Town. Through it all the band plays amazing music and Cash rumbles over the landscape.This is a fitting entry point into the work of one of the most important artists of both rock and roll and country music history. If you don't have Cash in your collection, and want to have the essentials this will pretty well do the job."
2,"Tiny ""book""","I was amazed that this ""book"" is about 2"" x 2"" x 3"" total size. I suppose if I paid attention to the wording that it is a ""block book"", I might have been aware of it being just that, a block. It's not worth our sending back, but I won't order another block book again. On each ""page"" there is a picture of Spot. On the opposite page is a word (i.e. BUNNY) and a drawing of the corresponding animal."
2,Not awful J&MC aping,"BRMC are the latest ""Buzzband"" and I can't quite figure out why. It's not a bad disc, but if I really wanted to listen to the Jesus & Mary Chain, I'd pull out my J&MC discs. So, SO, derivative. Let's hope they grow some personality of their own to go with their rockin' attitude."
4,"""my love burns for brmc""","the second full-length album from these leather-bound angels kicks you in the mouth with it's bluesy and muffled layer of guitar riffs. chords jam packed full of fuzz seem to come from nowhere on all sides. Tracks like love burns, whatever happened to my rock n roll (punk song), as sure as the sun, and salvation are flipping great songs not to mention the other 7 awesome tracks. Vocals reminiscent of the velvet underground and the dandy warhols. If you enjoy these bands definitley check them out. this album gets 10 thumbs up"
3,Better CD Than their live show,"I saw these guys in chicago at the metro and they were not at their best. The CD is way better than their live show. If you are interested in raw talent and an amazing live true rock show reminiscent of Iggy, the Feelies and the like try for Vax Wallo--an obscure Chicago band. If you can get hold of their cd's you will have found a real treasure."
3,Better than the Strokes but very similar,"These guys are alright some songs are good (the ""Rock N' Roll song) but overall the lyrics are too pretentious and it sounds like they are trying too hard to be ""cool"".This is their debut so maybe they'll get better and find their own sound...Try some instrumentals , add a saxaphone or something!They are better than those whining STROKES though.I would suggest the ex-SPIRITUALIZED LUPINE HOWL band instead of these guys...(They totally ripped of bassist Sean Cooks black leather image!)"
2,black jesus and the rebel marychain motorcycle club,"Rock and roll is appealing to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba! I enjoy this album. Great tunes, Big Poomba pleased with production and stars.I would reckon-mend this to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba, BP already listened and has no money.But anyone else who likes the rock and The Rock, I would definitely reckon-mend this to you. They are better than the Strokes and the White Stripes."
2,"Mediocre rock group, manufactured album","I've listend to the cd several times, since I realize that some get better with listening. I don't hate it. But it is nowhere near being even ""good"". Whoever wrote this band is as good as the White Stripes should burn in a musically igonorant hell."
1,Former Brian Jonestown Massacre dude strikes gold!!!!!!!!,"New punk rocker Peter Hayes is now rich, thanks to the dude from Brian Jonestown Massacre who hooked him up with BRMC!!!! What a great transition for Hayes!! Now he leads the way!!!BRMC writes catchy, fuzz-scratched rockers that get people jumpin' at the clubs. The suits in the industry like these guys cuz they sell records by the truckload, but the kids like BRMC for more pure reasons - namely, da music!!!!If you like the Warhols you'll also dig BRMC - it's a done deal!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Solid, moody release.","Definitely very catchy with some excellent tracks. Very listenable indie style recording, dark in places, energetic in others. I saw these guys live in mid-2007, and it's pretty clear that there's some very heavy voice dubbing on their recordings. Frankly, they sound like Jerry Lewis when they sing live - very high pitched, whiny voices compared to the recordings. They don't have bad voices at all; it's just a bit irksome when you expect one thing and go to a show to hear something vocally pretty different. Instrumentally the show was great and I'm not trying to argue they're bad singers - they just need some testosterone shots or to stop dubbing the recordings so much..."
2,Haven't I heard this before?,"This album earns two stars for a brilliant attempt at sounding exactly like The Jesus and Mary Chain. This album only gets two stars because if I wanted to listen to The Jesus and Mary Chain, I'd do just that. Homage to your influence is one thing, becoming them is another. Honestly, look at the cover photo of this album and compare it to the inside liner photo in the Jesus and Mary Chain's cd ""Honey's Dead"". B.R.M.C. should stand for ""Britpop ... of Major Copyrights""."
5,"They show their influences, so what!","This is an impressive debut album. These guys know their craft and pay homage to their roots while being creative and not ripping off. Everybody grew up listening to something.There are a lot of ideas and emotions on this CD. In order to appreciate this band and album you need to:a. listen to the CD a few times to let it all sink in; and thenb. play ""Whatever Happened to my Rock n' Roll"" in your car at full volume while driving in excess of 90 mph at 2 a.m.You won't be dissapointed."
4,BRMC Rawks!,"In the void of Jesus & Mary Chain (and my old LOOP, Dream Syndicate, and Rain Parade albums), I've been waiting for a band like this to hit the scene for some time. BRMC combines a fine pop sensibility with darker delvings. This one will be stuck in your car's CD player for days on repeat mode . . ."
3,Buyer Beware,There is a lot of hype going on here. Yes BRMC are good. Get a few mp3s before buying the album. Or better yet buy the Trail Of Dead CD when it comes out next week.
4,cold city streets,"some say the ""return of rawk"" began with creed and all the other posers. true believers know it never went away, it just got bloated on a steady diet of mtv and ""alternative"" radio. along comes BRMC, white stripes, strokes, shins, etc. like climbing into a '67 mustang, instead of a pimped out honda. as to BRMC, there are a few tracks i have skipped, which has left me giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. but overall, i have listened to it almost daily since last fall. i gave my soul to a new religion, and its priests are brmc"
4,Best of the Bunch,"There are about 3 or 4 books on hiking around Mt. St. Helens and I'd rate this one as best of the bunch. Mr Vielbig covers all the trails, has good maps and provides the right amount of information on routefinding and what to see."
2,Yikes! What happened?!,"The first time I heard Death in Vegas I was hooked. I LOVED Dirt. I LOVED the whole entire Dead Elvis CD... with a passion!!! Many a guest in my car was forced to listen to it. Ahhh. 'Cause it's THAT good. But this one... I don't know what went wrong... but it's just the complete opposite if Dead Elvis. Not good. No flow, no rhythm. It might be good if you never fell in love with Dead Elvis, but if that CD is what got you into this band in the first place, you probably won't like this one."
3,A good news/ bad news story,"I'm a diehard DIV fan so I was pretty stoke to see a new release.The disc of the new material is pretty weak sauce, nowhere near the content of the previous three. Maybe I'll grow to like it's minimalist content after a few more spins but really I can't be bothered at the moment.The second disc, a live recording of one of their shows totally kicks ass!!! It's amazing and I can only hope they decide to come to Canada @ some point becasue I'd love to see them."
5,Watercolor Simplified,"Of all the hundreds of art books I have, this is my favorite. Pat Weaver has a delightful painting style and is an extraordinary teacher. She is not one to condone the ""tricks"" of watercolor. She believes that learning to draw is essential . . . and possible. Tracing or projecting is frowned upon so she begins by explaining her dot to dot method of drawing. She then goes into color theory and picking a palette. Mrs. Weaver is a direct painter who chooses a limited palette and her paintings are bold, strong, and colorful. She ends the book with many step by step demos. After reading her book, I discovered that Mrs. Weaver teaches not only in Florida, but around the country and around the world. I have been fortunate enough to have taken some of her watercolor workshops. Her delightful personality is reflected in this book. This is a no-nonsense, informative reference for painters of all levels."
1,Less than expected,"This CD only works on old windows versions and cannot work on Windows 7, Vista or Windows XP. The seller did not make that note forthcoming and that is why it was so cheap. When I contacted the seller, he was less than helpful and, in fact, an a$%###& about it."
1,Misrepresented,This product is labeled as working on Win98 and XP. On the package it states it is for Win95/98 and when I tried to install it on XP it gave me an error stating that it will not work.
1,Ain't worth a cent!,"when i saw the music video, and then saw the cd single in a store, and saw it had a ""dirty"" remix version on it. i was so eager to play it after i had bought it. so i played it, and NOTHING new is on it from T-Boz. It's just a bunch of GUYS saying dirty stuff on it. If its GUYS, it shouldnt even be MARKED dirty!with the song title of ""touch myself,"" t-boz dissapoints her fans by not putting out a REAL ""dirty"" version of the song, no moaning with excitement, no t-words, no a-words, no p-words, NOTHING you would want to hear from a hot and sexy girl like T-Boz say, sing or rap in a song called ""Touch Myself."" Save your money and your time and DON'T buy this.Really music industry! If you're going to have a FEMALE have a song like this title, make it HOT, not some GUYS saying dirty stuff. If I wanted to hear a GUY say something nasty, I would just record myself on tape, and play it back. not worth the money at all."
4,Very good solo release from Saga's lead singer,This album is very well produced. Michael Sadler's voice is in top shape and the songs are well produced and catchy. A very good album.
5,A very fine yoga block.,This block is just what I wanted for my yoga practice. I use it at home and I also bring it with me to class. It's the perfect size and it's sturdy even though it's a foam block (as opposed to wood). Certainly a fine block and a great price.
5,Fettes Brot (fat bread) Kick ass!,"Grate dvd, but you may have truble using it if your dvd player is regen specific! Has all there music videos and video clips.Any one that is into german rap should have this!"
4,good and trippy,"this cd is great to chill or party to, depending on your frame of mind,sweet guitar and electronics all in all a good buy, i look forward to gettin the rest of the series"
4,Journeymen coming to the fore,"This young man's journeymen status was not wasted, as it would appear he has honed his skills, (as his talent goes without question) and along with other notables, for instance Peter White and his current label have produced a throughly enjoyable freshman album. A lovely mixture indeed!"
2,Copy protected,I just wanted to warn everyone that this CD is copy protected and doesn't allow you to load the songs on your Ipod.
3,Bad Sound Quality,"I was looking forward to this CD after hearing the great reviews. I enjoyed some songs in this CD, but I had a hard time getting past the bad sound quality. I don't know if I got a bad copy or if the quality of the music was reduced because of the mixing of tracks. I even tried it on other stereo systems and got the same low quality sound. Although I enjoyed some of the tracks, this CD is one of the lowest quality sounding CDS I own, so don't expect a high fidelity recording and maybe consider getting the MP3 version since it probably won't make a difference in sound quality."
5,great chill out disc,"This is not the style you are used to hearing from Seaman like in his Global undergound discs. This disc is a great chill out compilation, just put it on and sit back and relax. It shows Seaman's great skills as a superstar dj."
4,the first half put me to sleep...,"ok, this cd is split into 2: the first 5 tracks which put me to sleep and the rest.track 6 brings the pace up to a good tempo and is worth the buy.i think dave felt that he had to give us the required ""elevator music"" before he could actually let go."
3,Think again,"Dave Seaman is a super DJ, but this is not a super compilation. The Back to Mine series has brought us some creative gems with greater range (Tenaglia, Groove Armada, which still sounds fresh) that will make for better and longer-lasting listening. The first track is like something out of a cheesy film soundtrack, and even after several listens I don't think it is able to recover fully from it. I guess I am glad to have it for the few good tracks on the CD, but it is clearly not a Must Buy."
1,Qualude in CD form,"ZZZZZZZ. You've got to be kidding. This was my first purchase in the ""Back To Mine"" collection, along with Nick Warren. And a terrible thought ran thru my head as the sounds came from the headphones, ""What did I just blow 30+ bucks on?"" The songs are beautiful, but cmon, on and on with same beat going nowhere, building to nothing. Chilling is one thing, comatose is another. I'm listening to Nick Warren now, and even though I'm 'chilling', I'm nodding my head a bit, a good sign that I'm still awake. While listening to Dave Seaman, I thought I'd have to check for a pulse. So if you been out clubbing so long that the hum of the refrigerator sounds beautiful, purchase this cd."
5,6 stars would not be exagerated,"This is NOT Seaman you know from trancey Global Undergound series. The idea was to ask Seaman what his perfect chill-out compilation would sound like. Well, here it is and it is soooo beautyful... Top 10 in my +500 collection"
5,In the Maw,"Super book. Every article has new information either about pilgrimages to caves, cave rituals, cave ritual specialists, offerings, use of interior space in caves, or relationships of caves to surface sites. I have read and reread several of the chapters and wish that every US archaeologist would read this book. Alan Sandstrom has written an excellent chapter detailing a cave pilgrimage his family participated in last decade. There is also attention given to the place of rockshelters in sacred landscape in several articles. Read this together with Stone Houses and Earth Lords and you'll never look at caves and rockshelter assemblages the same."
3,Book does not come with the key for QUIA...,"I think this book is terrible and they need to get a different one for French, but that's besides the point because you need it anyway if your college uses it.One important note though: When you buy this book, know that it does not come with the book key for QUIA (online companion). It does come with the 2 CD's which you never use in class, but can use at home. But if your professor will require you to do the QUIA stuff for homework, which they usually do, this book will not provide the key for it. Usually the one you can buy at your bookstore comes with a key, but is very expensive. What I did was buy a cheaper version on eBay, then bought the book key on the website which is about $90."
3,Organizational Problem,"The attempt to categorize verbs according to themes is commendable but there should be exceptions among irregular verbs like avoir, etre and aller. These verbs are too important to postpone conjugations in later chapters. Also, it seems that the previous edition was more sufficient than this edition as there were some mistakes in the answer key."
1,Used and poor,"I am completely disappointed with this material. It didn't merit to be sold to anyone at all, judging from the exhaustive use it was put through. If the former user had worked the exercises with pencil instead of pen, it would have been easy to erase and re-use. This Student Activities Manual should not have been described as ""used and good."""
2,Motifs Intermediate French Text and Audio,Motifs: An Introduction to French is not for beginners with no knowledge of French. The text reference for the audio is hard to follow and the audio is very poor. The Pimsleur system is a totally different approach to learning French and I think it is better if you are seeking to learn French conversation.
3,well-organized but contains mistakes,"I was shocked to see on page 7 of the 5th edition this horrible mistake: Une poignet de main=a handshake. Yikes!!!! Didn't make me want to read any further... Doesn't a real person check the book before it goes to print? A computer spell checker would not have picked this up...On a more positive note, the book seems well organized and explanations are clear. However, the pages are very densely packed with lessons and drills. Visually, it could be a little more appealing."
1,Emits toxic fumes & high pitched shrill,"Pros : Well packaged, Pretty, Convenient 2 doorsCons : Unable to use near humans, Toxic fumes, Low Quality, Constant shrillBest Uses : Far away from people, animals and other life forms!This is absolutely NO GOOD for a personal bedroom or dorm! Arrived in good condition but as soon as plugged in started emitting a non-stop shrill so high pitched it's impossible to stay within hearing range. Shrill would not relent! After an hour started giving off toxic fumes. It took 4 hours with air freshener, open windows, air purifier and a/c running to get the stench out. SKIP THIS ONE , IT'S A DUD!EDIT: Interesting, I submitted the same review at Compact Appliance, where I got it from and they pulled the fridge from their website so as not to display my review! Look: [...]"
3,A little too concise.....,"Even though I have lived in Germany all my life, I knew verylittle about this region of the world.This book certainly is full of interesting information, the author no doubt is an expert.Contrary to some reviewers, I did not find it tedious reading at all.One draw back was the somewhat disorganized presentation, jumping back and forth in time.The other draw back was probably forced upon the author: It is simply too concise! I believe, about 100 more pages, and the author could have done justice to the subject - like it is, it is simply too superficial.This is a shame, as I am firmly convinced the author knows much more, than what he was allowed to write!"
3,Assumes a level of knowledge you may not have,"I found this book interesting, but feel like I lacked some of the pre-information needed to truly digest it. I consider myself well-read and geographically literate, but didn't know where a lot of the places were located, what a lot of the events the author obliquely refers to were, or what some of the terms used (e.g., ""the Porte"") meant.Because of this, I had to force myself to get through it. I did so because I hate hearing people attempt to explain the situation in the Balkans with a simple ""Oh, they're historical enemies."" In other words, I was looking for someone to tell me in about 150 pages all about 1,000 years of history. I think the author does succeed in doing that -- I have a better understanding of the situation than I did. But I think I have to read a lot more to decipher much of the information I now have.Maybe I'm just a dummy."
1,Confusion,"If you are looking for a chronological history of the Balkans, this isn't it. The book skips back and forth between the centuries in a confusing and disorganized manner."
2,Birthing pains of the Balkans,"Travelling through the Balkans, I was looking for an easy to read book that would give me an overview on the history of the region. A tall order for a slim book, and I wasn't expecting to get the grand tour. I didn't. But I didn't expect the book to be so dry and difficult to read as it was.A little too academic for my tastes and nonlinear in structure, The Balkans reads like a thesis - not exactly enjoyable to read, but it does make you think well past the final chapter.The author is generally sympathetic to the Balkans, arguing (fairly successfully) that the region is not a hotbed of simmering violence and that nationalism was not part of the agenda for many until the late 1800s.But in the end, The Balkans can only offer a glimpse of a very complicated region, and doesn't touch on modern times quite enough."
2,Too Dense and Unstructured for Everyman,"Pascked full of facts and theories. Comprehensive. Chapters organized by themes.For someone without European history or Balkan history background, the content is overwhelming and there is no structure which makes it intelligible.My summary:Orthodox Christian religion versus Turkish Muslim Ottoman rule of exploited peasants in a naturally poor geography for 500 years. European nationalism starts revolutions in the 1800's. The revolutions are not yet over.Definitely not a recommended book."
3,Good short history,"I was hoping for more discussion of the 90's war. This was actually - as the title states - a history of the Balkans. As such, it was helpful to understand some of the religious and cultural threads which underpinned that conflict.Interesting and readable."
5,Rip off,March of the 26 is just the older Napoleons Marshals with a new title and fancy cover. If you own one you don't need the other.
2,it's a conspiracy,"This movie was made before the Soviets/Russians released the flight data and voice recorders from KAL 007 and it shows. Angela Lansbury's character wants the world to believe that the US had a role in the shootdown, that 007 was on a spy mission, and that the 007 pilot was teasing the Russians. Some conspiracy theorists were taken to court for slander and found guilty. I wanted a visual aid for my class that had read a book about the last flight of 007, but this movie turned into a lesson in conspiracy propaganda. Way too ""patriotic"" of a message touting the perfect virtues of democracy and dangers of big government. I didn't know Lansbury was such a right winger. At least if there had been more action sequences illustrating the actual flight there might have been some reason to watch this movie. My ESL students had difficulty following the beauraucratic labyrynth featured in this film."
5,Fantastic,Hunt For The Red October I have owned for several years and still watch it 3+ times a year. Any Sean Conery fan is treated to a really good movie with many exciting actors. Great drama and good humor as well. K19 is also very good and intersting to see Russian view point. A Winner.
2,NOT like the book!,"My son and I just finished reading this book and thought it would be interesting to see it. As happens so many times, the movie was a disappointment compared to the book. The character names were mostly the same but the movie characters did not do the things the book characters did. There were characters left out of the movie and some added in. The movie changes to the story did nothing to improve the story. This was a movie about a boy named Agba and a horse named Sham but that is about the biggest similarity to the book's very sweet, inspiring story. The production values are very low as well. It seems very cheaply made. I wouldn't have like this even if I hadn't read the book first."
5,King Wind,"Excellent movie filled with suspense and good acting. I really got involved with it. Wonderful. Not disappointed at all. The horses were beautiful, and the movie left you wondering what was going to happen next."
4,A well done movie of the Godolphin Arabian,"This movie is produced quite well, although it does not include everything from the book, which is written by Marguerite Henry. I believe it would have made the movie a bit too long. Otherwise it is a pleasure to watch if you love horses. I am going to send it to my brother, because he gave me his copy of the book over 40 years ago, which I replaced from a purchase on Amazon. He will enjoy this movie also. Were it not for him, I never would have caught the bug to love and appreciate horses like I do."
5,Top-notch history lesson in the form of delightful fiction,"""King of the Wind"" is a classic, the story of one Arabian stallion who was given to the King of France as a gift from the desert and ended up on the stud farm of an English breeder. An accidental breeding to the Englishman's mare triggers the beginning of the Thoroughbred breed and as a result, all of today's Thohroughbred race horses descend from this stallion or two other Arabians, the Byerly Turk and the Darley Arabian. A true story told in a fashion to capture the hearts of young readers and viewers."
2,Depressing.,"Difficult to understand the dialogue. To me it was depressing, even though it was based on a true story. Sorry!"
4,King of the wind,"Great dvd for anyone who loves horses, this is a story of friendship between a boy & a horse, it has adventure as well."
3,Nice little movie but pretty slow paced,"This is a fluff movie that has a little bit about horses in it and uses the names of Glenda Jackson and Richard Harris as a bit of a come on, and they have miniscule roles. It is a lovely production that only suffers if you have inflated expectations. There's not a thing ""wrong"" with it; it just is not a sizzler. I love Marguerite Henry's books, and her books use people to tell the horse story, whereas this movie tends to use the horse to tell the boy's story. It was enjoyable, if slow paced, so for a young viewer it would be very nice."
2,Correction of description,"Ok, the Godolphin Arabian was one of three Arabian stallions who were bred here in the West with local horses to produce what is now refered to as the thoroughbred. Sham was a full fledged, highly bred Arabian, from stock whose lineage goes back many many generations. The stories of how these finely bred animals were treated in the West initally is what the book's author was trying to get across- not the story of some boy and his horse. The movie does not do the story justice, and thus the horse's life means little at the end credits. shame too. Sham, and the other two stallions, changed the world of racing forever."
3,Not as good as the book,"The video version is okay if you have not read the book. However, the film lacks much of the emotion that is present in the original story. Also, the film version completely leaves out the introduction in the book where Man-O-War wins the race against Sir Barton since this is what leads into the story of the Godolphin Arabian who is the ancestor of Man-O-War, one of the greatest race horses in American horse racing."
5,king of the wind,I bought this movie for my 9 year old daughter for Valentines Day. It was a great movie she loves horse movies and the whole family ejoyed it.
2,promises to be better than it is,"How could a book so good end up as a movie so bad? It makes the appearance of being a classic, with it's star-studded cast and cinematography, but fails miserably. There's just nothing worth watching it for. Stick with The Black Stallion and Black Beauty."
5,king of the wind,Thanks To Amazon we discovered a real life tale which is a must for all animal and/or horse lovers. This movie on DVD is a well cast period story.
2,Deadline by John Dunning,"This book had no characters that I could relate to. I was bored and kept expecting it to get better. The hero waws so focused on ""the story"" that it seemed unreal. It did not have a satisfactory ending."
5,One of my all time favourites,I loved this one. A refreshing read. Go And Buy This One and Keep It As A Treasure ...
4,"Funny, Facinating & Unusual, with a good message.","Bagley is a great character...his expressions, articulation, etc. All scenes & characters are jewels in this movie...so many quotable lines: ""I suppose young girls were involved,"" asks the Priest. ""Yes, says here that her breasts were spread with peanut butter."" Sounds stupid out of context, but the whole scene is classic."
4,An Original Comedy--,"I've seen Richard E. Grant in Henry & June as well as The Player.These were both roles in which he indulged in heavy drama, and didvery well in both.How to Get Ahead in Advertising is the first time I've seen Grant asa comedic player, and I laughed until I fell off the couch. His paranoid,bug-eyed antics and gestures are unparalleled; considering how heverbally abuses his female consumer base, the huge boil mocking himin the mirror is a fitting revenge. Watch and enjoy!"
1,Almost the Worst Ever,"I can't imagine how this tasteless, ridiculous, boring movie ever got any good ratings. You have a man talking to his boil! And promoting advertising at the end of the movie (because he went crazy?)."
5,Definitely British,"If you like British humour, this is definitely it. I was rolling off the sofa laughing, because this film is full of crazy ideas and obnoxious British-ness. You will feel with the wife, Julia, as her husband gets more and more absurd due to a pimple on his neck talking to him, and you will love him for his funky approach to life. I had rented this video before, by accident (it bears a completely different name in Germany, which is no way related to the English one), and it has become one of the movies you'll put on if you have friends over who ask for something seriously stupid."
4,It was great!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It's everyones favorite twins in an exciting horror story. It is the perfect combination and I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes sweet valley books or horror stories. I liked this book greatly and enjoyed the other books in this four part mini-series as well.
5,it was good,"I loved these Mini-series! I thought it was unrealistic though, because the ""ghost"" turned out to be a real person. But if it was a weird person, how did they have all those dreams? I thought it was good, but some didn't make sense."
3,Not bad,The book was okay but I hate it when they end a book that you have to wait till you read the next one.
5,Lego Mythical Creatures,This Lego set provides hours of entertainment. The easy to follow instructions (step by step with pictures) allow my 7 year old son to build creatures and feel proud of his own accomplishments! He is also able to use his imagination in building anything he thinks of. THe colorful block make it more exciting too!
3,Okay product for the price.,"The guitar has trouble staying tuned and the nut at the top that holds the strings spontaneously broke (probably from the tension on it by the strings and a manufacturing defect). On the other hand Customer Service from West was excellent, they were willing to pay for my return shipping and sending the product back to me. So its is a poor product but a great company."
2,"Looks good, OK sound, holds tuning poorly","The finish and construction are quite good; the guitar is attractive. The tone is pretty good, and it has good volume. However, I don't think much of it as a musical instrument, because it is difficult to tune, and it fails to hold its tuning very well. The difficulty with tuning is this: when you start with any string and progress through the other strings, by the time you are done the first string is out of tune significantly. You end up cycling through the six strings repeatedly until the process converges - almost. And then if you want to play it the next day, you go through it all again. I think that the neck is just not stiff enough to resist the tension on the strings properly."
2,The Human League Crash(ed)!,"""Crash"" is my least favorite Human League album. Why? Because Terry Lewis, Jimmy Jam, & Janet Jackson have absolutely nothing in common with The Human League. Except maybe an occassional pop lyric. The Human League's signature sound is synthesizers, drum machines, and guitar samples. This album could have been a solo effort for any of the Human League members. And they could have gotten away with it! It's not a bad album, it's just a musical departure for the League. Tracks I liked are: ""Love is all that Matters"", ""Party"", and ""Love on the Run""."
3,"A fun, energetic album","Crash--released in 1986--is an enjoyable album from the Human League. I had never planned on getting this particular album from the Human League, but I came across it somewhere, and I am glad that I got it. Crash consists of ten tracks, and all of them are listenable--my preferences are ""Human,"" ""Jam,"" and ""Love Is All That Matters."" I enjoy Philip Oakey's distinctive vocals, too, and the ladies, Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall, also pull off nice vocal performances. I consider ""Human"" to be a classic song. This plaintive, unforgettable song features engaging, smooth-sounding singing from Oakey. ""Jam"" is also a catchy, upbeat cut; I had never heard it until I got Crash. ""Love Is All That Matters"" is another infectious, well-crafted song. The song lyrics are included in the CD booklet, and the CD is almost 45 minutes. I recommend Crash--it is good pop music."
4,Good album,"Crash is 44 minutes and 40 seconds long and was released in September 1986. Two of the three songs from charted from the album. This was the album that saved the group. Their last album took two years to complete. One can cleary hear the Synthpop sound mixed with Dance-pop and New Wave. If one is looking for a change of music, then this is it. They get an A+ from me.Side OneMoneySwangHuman#1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#1 U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club PlayJamAre You Ever Coming Back?Side TwoI Need Your Loving#44 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesPartyLove On the RunThe Real ThingLove Is All That MattersDid not chart"
3,Let's see this as a separate album,"I like Human and Love Is All That Matters the most on this one. Specially the extended versions. This album is made for the dance floor and nothing else. So if you're a die-hard fan of the League, you can't miss this one. I see this one as a particular '1986 album', just like the Cherelle, Alexander O'Neal & SOS Band-albums from that same area. The Janet Jackson album Control is the best example I think. Jimmi Jam & Terry Lewis are all over the album(s). Just like a blueprint from that time in dance music."
2,A sort of funny disappointment,"David Bowman's ""Let the Dog Drive,"" while frequently funny, seems to suffer from a case of wackiness for wackiness' sake, a sort of look-how-crazy-I-am voice that leads us through various scenes of senseless violence and college bull session-like ruminations on such highbrow fare as Emily Dickinson. Which is a shame, since there's a lot of good material here, hiding just behind the screen of self-conscious hilarity. The scene that lends the book its title hints at potential the rest of the story never quite lives up to, leaving us to grow tired of the orange motif, the limp terrorism subplot, and various instances where characters are shot or beat up without managing to elicit any sympathy from the reader. When a suposedly focal character dies and you find yourself not particularly caring and in fact being *annoyed* that the other characters are obsessed with her, you know this story is in trouble."
3,"Funnier than ""Travels with my aunt""","Funny, zany but not more than that.An easy read, entertaining and sometime get's tedious trying be ""crazy""."
5,GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS!,"This is one of the most arresting works of fiction I've ever read; when I finished the book, I immediately turned it over and began to re-read it. It defies description-it must be read and savored and purchased for one's dearest and most discerning friends. The story clings to me like a spider web I wandered into on a summer morning."
1,"PURE JUNK. OR I SHOULD SAY ""JUNKIE"".",THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF AN INEPT WRITER TRYING TO IMPRESS THE WORLD WITH ALL THE KNOWLEDGE HE AMASSED WHILE PARKED IN FRONT OF A TV SET HIS ENTIRE CHILDHOOD. HIS TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT LEARNING ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER.
3,i need dvd,Im working in China but from the states and I need DVD and I want tapes of the entire episodes. My daughter who is 5 now would love this show!
2,A Decade of the Waltons VHS,"I am interested in the whole show, each one as they were aired on T.V., but without the commercials of course. I don't want just bits and pieces here and there, but the whole show of each airing. Is that possible? If not, what you've got here is only something to wish any fan had the whole production and not just excerpts. That is what I am interested in, not bits and pieces. So, this VHS recording is of no use to me."
3,Very Helpful with many facts about costumes,"This book is very helpful for getting basic details of folk and dance costumes from throughout the world. There are colored sketches of most costumes, but a few more would be helpful. They describe many things that are not illustrated, yet sometimes illustrate items for which there are scant descriptions. Unfortunamtely, however, there are no costumes from most of Africa. This is a serious omission for a book claiming to cover world costume."

2,Good for Children,"Just too elementary for me, the hand done drawings are fine for children to get an idea but as a reference it isn't useful."
1,Don't Buy These Clamps!,"I purchased 6 Denali Speed Grip Bar Clamp/Spreaders in August 2007. Within 6 months of light use (used 2 or 3 times in my home workshop), three of the clamps have failed and will not hold pressure. When I looked into getting warranty replacements I found out these clamps do not come with any warranty. None! I will not buy a Denali product again."
2,if quality was better.....,"Got these about a month ago, one works well, the other slips as soon as it starts to build pressure. The design seems to be good, clutch plates are heavier than my store brand speed clamps. There are two plate one direction and one the other, my others have only one clutch each direction. The pivit point for the handle has a steel dowel as to plastic on the generics. That said I have yet to get a Toolshop (Menards brand) clamp that didnt work. Havent broke one yet either.If these clamps all worked when I got them I'd give them 4 1/2 stars. They do fit the hand comfotably, and seem to clamp well when they work. Tighten up Q.C. and these would be good clamps for the money."
1,They do not hold up,Worked fine for a while then they just quit holding a grip.No warranty. Pay a little more for a name brand and get reliable quality.Denali DeNoWay!
1,Look elsewhere,"Lightweight, overpriced, and overall poor quality. The grip action is halting and stiff, and the clutch is prone to skipping. Anything else would be better."
5,The best Power Rangers series ever!,"This PR series kicks butt!! It reminded me of the 3rd season of MMPR because it Ninja-themed but better!! The actors are great, the zords are cool, and the villains are funny including Lothor, one of my favorite villain of Power Rangers! Dudes, if you heard lot of people saying this series the worst,ignore them because this series rocks!!!"
2,I agree,I agree with the pearson who said ninja storm couldn't beat the other seasons ninja storm is boring pop it into the VcR once and you probly won't put it in again I know I'm crazy but I loved the wild force so much better but ninja storm does have good acting better than wild force ninja storm has only 1 girl rangertori and shes blue insted of yellow I think this new guy making power rangers has got it all wrong and I think he is a discriminator to females dino thunder is only having 1 female ranger but she will be yellow so thats good anyways the first three episodes are all lame although beauty and the beach was pretty good sorry all you ninja storm fans out ther but wild force is 100 times better.
5,A Great Comedy,This movie is really great.I've always loved Monty Python. I love the show and all their movies. If you haven't see this movie then you are really missing out.The only thing that I could say that would be bad about this movie is the picture and sound quality but other then that I really can't think of anything else.
5,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"Perhaps one of the greatest film comedies of all time (certainly for Pythonites), this zany cult classic by the famed Monty Python troupe will leave you gasping for breath and occasionally howling at the hilarious bad taste of certain slapstick sequences. Cleese, Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Gilliam, and Jones all play multiple roles, combining non-sequitur humor with bloody duels and other pratfalls that parody medieval chivalry and archaic religious sentiment. Somehow, senselessly silly gags like the encounter with a killer rabbit and the Knights Who Say ""Ni!"" tickle the funny bone no matter how many times you watch. For brilliant, irreverent lunacy, seek the ""Holy Grail."""
2,Review of Boxed Set only (film itself = 5 stars),"Nothing to say about the film itself - simply a word of warning about the box set: it appears from the product listing to be simply a copy of the ordinary 2 DVD edition - which retails for less than half the price of this boxed set - with a copy of the screenplay and some cards and senitypes (whatever they are) thrown in.The complete screenplay can be obtained from literally hundreds of places on the net - just try googling on ""anarcho-syndicalist commune"" and you'll see.You do the maths. Twenty bucks for some cards?Someone's having a laugh, and my guess is he's not part of a self-perpetuating autonomous collective.Olly Buxton"
3,"Panasonic BDP 55, latest firmware, says cannot read disc","This player plays other discs, other Panasonic player plays this disc. The combination is not working though. A great movie I would love to watch on both players I own!Maybe 5 stars later..."
4,still fantastic silliness,"Got it as a streaming video, so it is now part of my library and I can watch it anytime, from a variety of platforms/devices. Good video and audio quality."
5,A Legend In Blu Ray,"They made a legend of comedy in blu-ray, what could be better! This has so many extra features it is amazing! The clarity of the movie is breath taking! I am very happy with this purchase, and will hold on to this one. I am happy to see that they are making these older classic movies in bluray!"
5,Great movie!,"This is such a hilarious movie. I highly recommend it. But if you aren't in to slapstick, british humor...this may not be your thing."
5,A Comedic Masterpeice,"this is onbe of the greatest comedy's ever fimed, this shows that you can make a funny movie with a very tight budget, i believe it takes real talent to make a movie like this, and this movie will stand as one of the great comedy's for generations and generations of humans."
5,Ni!,This is one of the most hilarious DVDs I've Ever seen. The extra features on this DVD are really great too.
5,Too funny!,I just love this movie! It is just too funny. From Roger the Shrubber to Bring out your dead! The only draw back is that is ends abruptly...almost as if they ran out of time. But a wonderfully funny movie!
5,Monty Python and the holy grail!,"I saw this movie, long ago. Oh, and I FELL IN LOVE! I could nearly repeat the whole thing! I don't even know what to write for such a funny movie, uh...3 words...""buy it now"""
1,"Slap on ""Special Edition""","Whats with film distbutors slapping on ""Special Edtion"" on DVDs nowadays when there is nothing really special about it? Not to say Holy Grail is still a KICK A**, truely special film, just this ""edtion"" has ""special"" slapped on the cover, with no visible content. Some commentary lifted from the LD would be conciderd genuinly special. Maybe even some outtakes or deleted scenes! If you already own this DVD, don't be suckered in by this so-called ""Special Edition"". If you don't have it GET IT IMMEADTALY!"
5,A NUTE?????????????????,"Whenever I watch this masterpiece comedy I come as close as anyone can to pee and cry of laughter, I always cried, the first time i peed. This movie is so hilarious, I can't even tell you a scene that was the best, they all are classics."
4,Still hilarious!,"I wasn't sure I'd like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" after all these years, but as soon as I popped in the videotype, I remembered exactly why I once found this film so funny. The humor is incredibly irreverent and, after all these years, iconic. Who can forget the argument about sparrows carrying coconuts to England, or the killer rabbit, or the serenade to Sir Robin? The humor ranges from satire to potty jokes, from dark humor to downright silliness. As with all Monty Python movies, the scenes hang loosely together, and some seem included merely because the writers came up with a joke over a few pints and couldn't bear to exclude it.The film epitomizes Monty Python and the craziness of the British comedy group popular during the 1970's. If you saw this years ago, you'll be surprised how funny it still is. And if you've NEVER seen it, you should treat yourself, especially since lines from it continue to crop up in ordinary conversation."
5,Too Damn Funny Too Miss,"This movie Is so damn funny. There so many funny scences; The killer bunny, the bridge keeper, the knights of the round table song, Dennis's economics, the black knight, the witch proving, the discussion of swallows and coconuts, castle anthrax, the french castle, swamp castle, the cave, and the blessing."
5,"Aug. 19, 2011",Friday night screening was a newly restored copy of Sony's Monty Python and the Holy Grail at The Reel Thing XXVII.
5,"Great movie, great price","I was looking for a copy of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" to introduce my son to the genre (and see the movie myself again). This item is the movie, absolutely no problems with the product, good price too."
5,"In the name of God, I must review this movie!","Sweet! Review number 777!If you haven't seen this movie, and can understand sometimes complicated British humor, then get it! It has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. If you have no knowledge of British humor though you may get a bit confused, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're gonna expect nothing but toilet humor. Plus, this movie must have the most halting ending ever for a movie, and it's extremely unpredictable!I also recommend Life of Brian, which in my opinion is just as funny as this movie.Just be prepared for the unexpected whilst watching this movie, it's very strange. Great though!"
5,The only movie I can see over and over and still laugh,"The repressed peasant, Sir Robin's minstrels, the three questions (by the way, what's YOUR favorite color?) -- who could possible pick one favorite bit? It still cracks me up, but now I also have the pleasure of anticipating the funniest parts, especially the throw-away lines. You have to pay close attention to catch them all!"
5,The Funniest Movie Ever!,"This is the tackiest, not to mention the funniest movie that ever existed! I was laughing so hard I nearly ""farted in my general direction!"" Graham Chapman (RIP) did an excellent job playing King Arthur and Terry Gilliam did one heck of a good job playing Patsy. The rest of the Pythoners played very outrageous roles. I talked about this movie a lot with my buddies at school and I would impersonate King Arthur just for laughs and call certain boys in my classs a different character. In closing, the opening credits with subtitles was just as hilarious as the movie itself! Long live, the Pythoners!"
5,FUNNY!,THIS IS A FUUNNY MOVIE.MONTY PYTHON HAS GREAT WRITERS THAT COME UP WITH THE WEAIRDEST THINGS.EVERYBODY SHOULD WATCH THIS.
4,what the?,I ordered MPHG in blu-ray format LAST MAY and it still hasn't shipped. Does ANYBODY out there know why this title was advertised for sale nearly one year ago but still isn't available?? 4 stars just because I had to rate to ask the question. I WANT MY HOLY GRAIL...............IN BLU-RAY.
3,so so,"Remember it as being better when we were in college. Much vulgar language and inuendo and skin. Won't watch it again, will be resold...."
2,"Odd, very odd!","This has to be the weirdest movie I have ever seen! It has cocconuts to killer rabbits. Now thats just silly! If you are a person who likes cartoon creatures or just one odd guy, heres your movie!"
3,NOT WORTH IT,"The movie was quite a drag compared to ""SPAMALOT"" currently on stage. And the special features were not very interesting. Quite disappointed in the set."
5,Delirious Madcap Adventure!,"If you're a fan of the Monty Python Show, this is one movie you must not miss. Sociopathic, insane, oddball humor surround it's adventure plot. Hoo boy, you have to watch it to understand...this movie left me devestated in laughter, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that lacks sanity.Nee! END"
4,A breath of fresh air.,With all the deadly serious movies about the grail out there these days it's good to once again watch a movie that treats the subject with a sense of humor.
4,"Classic film, average DVD","Yes, this is, without a doubt, one of the funniest films ever made. Python's classic humor has highly influenced untold numbers of comedians (including the original SNL cast) and several generations of movie fans who like their humor a bit more witty than most of what passes for comedy in Hollywood these days.Why I did not give this DVD 5 stars is the lack of extra features. There is a director's commentary out there--I heard it years ago on Comedy Central!This sad fact aside, the color has been brilliantly restored to the print, which is usually washed out. The sound is nicely preserved as well.When they get around to releasing a DVD worthy of this fine film, I will be glad to give it as many stars as possible."
2,"Great Movie, Bad Packaging","This is a great movie preformed by the legendary comedy troupe Monty Python. I have nothing to say about the movie, other than everyone should watch it at least once even if you're not a Python fan. This review is to serve as a warning to potential purchasers. I purchased this movie only to find the discs were scratched due to a poor packaging design. This 2 disc set stacks both discs one on top of the other on a single bracket, without a separator. If you are unlucky like me the bracket was rather lose allowing the DVD's to rotate independently of one another, resulting in many tiny scratches rendering the feature DVD unreadable. You can find the exact same features on the Special Edition (Wide Screen Edition) but without the movie cel and script, not to mention saving yourself some 20 bucks."
2,Beware the subtitle glitch!,"This is, of course, one of the funniest movies ever made, and the new SE looks very good as well. But the DVD has a major flaw. Subtitles appear intermittently and cannot be removed. Over 100 posters to the Home Theater Forum web site have already reported on this problem which seems mainly to appear with Toshiba and Sony players. There is no apparent fix to the problem, which appears tied to one of the special features on the disc.Columbia (which is owned by Sony!) should face the Spanish Inquisition for doing this to Python fans!"
5,SHE TURNED ME INTO A NYEWT!!!!,"I had this movie on tape, but someone in my family taped over it. I was devastated!!!!! If you have never seen this video, you are probably thinking that all these people who wrote these reviews are insane. And we ARE!!!!!!! No, but seriously, I have been majorly depressed, watched this movie, and felt much better....multiple times! This is also great if you've been watching horror movies late at night and are too scared to get up from the couch....just pop this baby in and I GUARANTEE you won't get nightmares! ;-} Seriously, try this out. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!"
2,Funniest movie ever? Not really...,"Sorry to burst your bubble, all you Monty Python freaks, but this movie was only mildly funny in several places, certainly never ""wet-your-pants hilarious."" A masterpiece? Come on! I guess this just isn't my type of comedy, or it could be that I saw this on a bus coming home from a camping trip that I hated so much everything seemed bad. Maybe I need to look at it again, but I doubt my opinion will change that much."
3,Pythonreview,This one drags a bit. It's amuzing but moves slowly. The DVD was delivered on time and in excellent condition.
1,Most overrated movie ever,"I had been told several times that this was a really good classic movie and finally found a copy of it. About midway thru I had the first urge ever during a movie to shut it off. It was literally that bad! But, I decided to push to the end. Big mistake! The movie just ends abruptly. Literally! The screen rips in the middle of a scene.This movie is an absolutely travesty and wholly unfunny. I have not the slightest clue what people find funny about this. Maybe its the opiate of the masses. Maybe its one of those cult movies like the Ed Wood stuff that is so bad its funny, but this doesnt really put itself out that way and its fans seem to really be deluded into thinking its funny. It just plain isnt! At all.I hope I can save two hours from someones life by warning them to find another movie that is actually funny or entertaining."
5,If You Don't Buy This Video I will say NI! To You!!,"Still one of the funniest films ever made, this special edition DVD just adds to the Hillarity. I laughed for 10 minutes straight after clicking on ""The Hard of Hearing"" portion af disc one's menu. Disc two also have some very funny bits. Michael Palin as the Minister of food explaining what you can do with coconuts. Terry Jones giving directions for the Gregorian Chant sing-a-long, the Knights of the Round Table singing and dancing in leggo not to mention several commentaries from the Python troup themselves. BUY THIS ONE!!!"
5,A different kind of Classic,"This is for the people of the world that love to laugh. Filled to the brim with good old british humor that appeals to us all. Great for young and old - something all will love. If you have seen anything by Monty Pythons and loved it this is the best. Every time I find new laughs and old ones too! The behind the scenes info is great, and almos unbelievable that most of it was filmed all in one castle. And then of course there is the educational film that all must see ""How to use your coconuts""! After you pass Coconuts 101 you can sing along with Sir Robin and all your other favorites. A must for any Monty Pythons fan!!"
5,Nice to see the reviewers saw the film . . . not,"Nevermind Maltin, who knows why anyone listens to him, but how could anyone say that the three-headed knights (sic) say ""nee""? And the rabbit is never referred to as a ""bunny"". It would be nice if the reviewers here could at least pay attention. You think I'm being picky? What if Shannon in a review said ""Rosebud"" referred to Kane's ice skates?"
5,English humor...,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. It's got to be one of the funniest of all time. I love most British/English comedy, and this is near the tops."
5,i love this movie(so many memoriable lines),"i still remember playing fallout 2 in the late 90's with marauders searching for the holy hand grenade of antioch, i wish fallout 3 had a holy grail reference. some great lines to indocturne anyone that hasn't experienced the greatness of the holy grail: help help i'm being repressed...bloody peasant...oh what a give away-your arm's off...just a flesh wound-we are the keepers of the sacred words: ni, pang,& niwong-cut down the largest tree in the forest with, a hering-its a loneley life/dressing/undressing/making exciteing underwear-i warned you/do they ever listen/no no/its just a harmless bunny-1,2,5... 3 sir... 3(throws the holy hand grenade to vanquish the mighty rabbit)-what, is the airspeed veloity of an unladen swallow."
4,Good transfer but....,It's mainly the packaging. You nearly need a crowbar to pry the DVD loose. The transfer on the film is the best version I've seen. The bonus segment at the beginning is cute but it's the only part with stereo. I would have liked the whole movie redone in 5.1 digital.
4,"Great film, poor packaging","As another reviewer wrote, it is a little difficult to remove the disc from the package. Do you really NEED the script? Probably not, but it's cool to have!"
4,Wow,"For all you Python fans out there this is great. Everything from the chase the killer rabbit mode to the Japanese dubbed version to the subtitle for people who don't like the film, this DVD has it all. There is but one snaffoo. I think the Pythons designed this DVD case themselves as a joke. There are two disks with one spindle. Supposedly they both fit on the spindle, which is possible, but the problem is that the people who assemble these little DVD box sets are too lazy to put it on correctly. So what happens? The disks get scratched. When I bought it at [We will soon be taking over the world and have a hobby of destroying the economies of small countries]mart mine was scratched so I took it back. I got my new one and it was scratched. I sat with the service person opening every single copy of the DVD only to find that all of them were scratched. Wow-nice one DVD packing people. Lets put some more pride in our work! Anyway the DVD itself is marvelous. Buy it!"
5,Just as funny as ever!,Purchased this for my son for Christmas - now we have a new Python fan in our midst. Excellent film - wonderful to find it on DVD!
5,Anything Monty Python is great!,I've never seen anything by Monty Python that I didn't like. There's so many hilarious scenes that people quote verbateum! If you haven't seen it you really need to!
5,Still a classic,What a hoot seeing it after all these years. My teenage son loves it and can now quote the movies best lines - née!K
2,The Move is a 5 but this Collector's Edition is a 2.5,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the greatest comedies of our time (in fact I think I'm going to watch it right now,) however, this ""Collector's Edition"" is just the same as the ""Special Edition"" but it comes in a fancy-dancy box and comes with a book (whooooooo!!!!) and a film cell (aren't you impressed, I thought so.) So, if you are a hardcore fan you might just want to get it because it has the Python name on it. Us regular fans will stick with our old copies of the Special Edition (for it is the same)"
2,"Bad DVD transfer - No better than VHS, maybe worse!","The DVD version looks ""dirty"", as though it was projected on a screen and then digitally recorded (the center is even brighter than the corners!). I mean, the image is even off-center somewhat. The additional DVD features are limited to a bunch of uninteresting movie trailers. Not worth the extra money over the VHS version. Actually I spotted some digital image glitches like the ones you see on a low-resolution .jpeg, this is in addition to all the flickering crap you see in regular film movies. If you still want it, save some money and buy the VHS version."
5,"If I could, I'd give it (on DVD) 6 stars!","This movie is outrageously hilarious. If ""Excalibur"" is the definative movie-telling of the Authur Legend, then Monty Python's Holy Grail is the Ultimate Parody.From the ""horses"" that lead to a discussion of sparrows, to the three-headed giant, to the French Knights, to the Brave Sir Robin, you will be left laughing til your sides hurt.The DVD version of the movie restores the portions of the screen cut off by the pan-and-scan process. The Python troupe notoriously used the big screen to their fullest advantage. You can now SEE things that could only be heard in the VHS version. And hearing gets better too thanks to Dolby Sound.Granted, this is dry English humor with a bit of gratitous violence... so it may not be for everyone... but:If you are a fan of the Aurthur Legend or just like off-the-wall comedy, this is a must see for you."
4,The movie quality was excellent,"We are enjoying this set. The movie quality was great, the extras disc was good, too. It has a sing along to the ""Knights of Camelot"" song that captioned the words and there were a few we hadn't figured out in all the years we have been watching the movie. The third disc, though, is about ""Spamalot"" which was only OK - kind of a stretch in my opinion. The quiz on the extras disc was pretty tough if you haven't seen the movie in a while, but we had fun competing for the most correct answers. I would have preferred the 3rd disc to also be about the movie, but it was still a good value for Grail fans."
5,Classic,"This is as good as it gets. If you are a Python fan, watch out, you may wind up wetting the couch."
5,I unclog my nose at your auntie,"This movie is rediculisly funny. The Dvd has a bunch of cool extra features featuring the Camelot song in lego format! So, if you like stupid humor and a Monty Python fan youll deffinetly love this film. A MUST BUY!!!"
5,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"This is SO funny! I love it! My family and I are such fans of this movie that we know all the words to the Camalot song, a.k.a. Knights of the Round Table! We have entire scenes memorized!This movie is about King Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail. He is joined by Sir Lancelot, Sir Robin, Sir Galahad and the rest as they search throughout England for a holy cup. Their quest begins when King Arthur has finally rounded up his knights of the Round Table and they are given an assignment from the Lord. Arthur and his knights encounter a taunting French guard, knights that say ""Ne"" and lots more! Filled with funny songs and catchy lines, this is one movie you won't want to miss!!!!"
3,Not for the chicken hearted (such as Sir Robin),"Granted - it often drags, some sequences are boring, and those expecting a plot (...which would only show they have never watched Monty Python) will be disappointed. Yet anyone with the slightest interest in the Middle Ages will be hard put not to collapse with laughter at some of the characters and scenes. Culture buffs (...well, most of them...) would call this junk food, but those who love humour would agree that it is as spicy as nachos and addictive as crisps. Fill up!"
2,Moments of genius immersed in boredom.,"The movie has a few great spots but is so slow, one might become too bored to appreciate them. I think Airplane is a better choice for tongue-in-cheek humor as its humor is non-stop."
4,Fun,A fun way to show high school students certain aspects of European History by showing certain clips. A fun movie especially if you understand history.
5,What is your favorite color?,"The movie is funny. It is British humor, so it takes a little to get used to, but it is a great movie. The sillyness of the movie is what makes it funny. Knights on imaginary horses. A killer Vorpal rabbit that attacks them. It also makes fun of the fuedal system."
5,The Best and Most Brilliant Comedy,"I think that ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is one of the best comedy movies ever. The characters are awesome and it's a very enjoyable movie. Now, there are those that don't find Python comedy funny, but if you do, this movie will tickle you silly. Ahh - it's wonderful - I never get tired of it!"
5,It's a fair cop,"This is the greatest movie ever made!! Who could have imagined that it could possibly be better than the original release? It's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?! The most amazing thing about this release is that it floats in water!! So therefore it must be made of wood! Black Knights, killer rabbits, necromancers, shrubbers, and even so called Arthur kings can appreciate this new release. Pie lesu domine!!!"
4,Superb extra features,"The Extra super special, not just ordinary special, but super special edition is packed with extras to make a python addict drool. What is most amazing with the DVD is the depth of color that is simply lost on VHS copies of the film. Having seen the movie any number of times, the difference truly is amazing.The DVD only loses minor points in the artifacts section shows some reviews that are impossible to read. Therefore, what's the point.As to the Lego edition - sheer maniacal brilliance."
5,The funniest movie of all-time!!!,"I love this movie! It's the funniest thing ever!!!Plot: A British spoof of medevil movies that finds King Arthur and his knights of the round table on a quest for the elusive Holy Grail. Obviously, many misadventures ensue.Rating Flags: Bloody Comic Violence..., Language(a couple s words and so forth) and Sexual References.Bottom Line: Extremely funny! A warning though; it's British humor. While it is definetly a comedy, it's still beautifly shot and features brilliant locations."
3,Arthur Mythos,This entry in the King Arthur mythos plays more like a comedy. Set in England in 932 AD. It's just a flesh wound...
3,Monty Python and the Holy grail,"It was okay, but it didn't seem to have alot of features that I had thought it might have had."
2,Only Funny When Your High,"I've seen this movie 4 times now and ever since the first time I sit there wondering ""What the heck do people think is funny in this movie"" - Than I realized that if I had been high when I watched it this movie probably would have been hilarious! That's actually a good thing because than I could have some killer food and laugh at this stuff even though usually I'd just turn it off lol"
5,monty pyphon and the holy grail better then other 2,this is way funnier then the other 2 i laugh all the way through it's great buy it ......
1,This movie is appalling!,"This movie is an insult to England. Not only is it grossly historically inaccurate, but this information appears to presented as if it is intended to be in some way realistic. Doing some research at a local university, I discovered that in fact, there was no castle Anthrax! Not only that, but the castle of AAAAAAAG is also a lie! I find it despicable. And the remaking of the trjoan horse was ridiculous, they thought it was a rabbit. No wonder that this ploy failed in the movie. The weight that a pigeon can carry was also inaccurate, and African swallows are migratory.Its this kind of rubbish that is ruining our world."
1,I've never laughed so hard,"I'd actually give this 5 stars, but that's what so many people are giving it that you probably wouldn't read my review if I gave it 5. This is is the funniest movie ever. Humor this silly has never been so funny. I love co-director Terry Gilliam, who directed TIME BANDITS, my favorite movie. This is my second favorite."
2,WHAT'S WITH THE ENDING?,"I started out enjoying this movie, and thought it was clever (Knights of Ni, and the African swallow bit). But what gives at the end? I felt very cheated and actually returned it to Blockbuster for a free movie coupon (they have a guarantee). What happened with the Holy Grail, you know, the whole point of the film...?"
2,The CREATORS of this movie should be sacked.,"This movie is NOT FUNNY! Some of the humor is childish, some of the humor is just stupid, and the rest of it is very, very disgusting. The scenes involving body limbs being cut off for any reason almost had me puke right in front of the TV. And the blood that comes from the aftermath is so obviously fake, but it comes in very disturbing gushes. It's outrageous to believe this movie was rated PG. But the reason I gave it 2 stars is that there were only a FEW moments that made me chuckle, including the opening credit subtitle gag, the ""Trojans"" scene, and the annoying man who sings constantly alongside Robin Hood, but doesn't know he's being a pain in the butt.So, in other words, don't see this movie if very disgusting humor is not your cup of tea. But if you've been watching Beavis And Butthead since the day you were born, you might like it."
5,Absolutely spiffing old chaps,"This is a top notch, wacky, way out film. From the black knight, who goes on fighting even after both arms and a leg get cut off, and then calls it a draw when he loses his remaining leg claiming ""it's only a flesh wound"", to the killer white rabbit who bites off peoples heads...this is as far out there as they come. Some people just don't get it, my husband being one of them...he even fell asleep half way through. And so, to those people I have only one thing to say....""Ni!, Ni! NI, NI, NI, NI, NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII""."
5,"""Yes! We All Shall Be Spanked!""","I Know, I Know. We all agree that this is quite possibly the Best Comedic Movie of All Time. The Knights that say Ni!, the Killer Rabbit, the Bridge of Death, The Rude Frenchmen... It's all Brilliant.But what I've noticed is that few of the reviews talk about how memorable & quotable it is! This is a movie that will stay with you ( & your friends) until the day you die! You will be quoting lines out of this movie for the rest of your life. That's how good this ""The Holy Grail"" is.Buy This Movie. Watch it Repeatedly. Ni!"
5,one of the most addictive movies ever,this movie is just plane silly but everyone loves it becuase of the fact my favorite knights would have to be brave sir richard and gallahad when he is in the castle anthrax
5,Must be on a top 10 list somewhere...,"I was first introduced to Holy Grail when I was a young child, and, though I never really absorbed the meanings of any word in the film, was seen ""horse riding"" around my kindergarden playground yelling, ""Help! Help! I'm being repressed!"" Since then, I have come to understand and love this movie, along with all other Monty Python works. I have also used many Python philosophies in my every day life. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a timeless masterpiece that cannot and will not die in the anals of comedy."
5,Classic.,"I love it. It made me laugh and think. I love English humor. If I am not dead yet, I will watch it again."
3,No better than The VHS....,"What a disappointment! After seeing the fantastic job that was done putting The Meaning of Life on DVD, I was excited to see the Holy Grail receive the same treatment. We all know how poor the film quality of the Python films is and anyone who has seen TMoL knows how much better it looks on DVD. Not so with the Holy Grail, the video is no better at all, and the sound may be better on VHS. About the only thing better about the DVD is the chapter search. All in all I was very disappointed to say the least. Of course this is just my opinion, I could be wrong."
5,AND NOW....A REVIEW THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!,"This has to be the worst film ever! Monty Python has to have some of the stupidest sons of...SORRY ABOUT THE INTERUPTION IN THE REVIEW. THIS REVIEWER HAS BEEN SACKED. But I do have to admit that this film is really full of...SORRY ABOUT THAT INTERUPTION, FOLKS. THE PERSON THAT SACKED THE FIRST REVIEWER HAS ALSO BEEN SACKED. Well, I must say, this is the funniest Monty Python film ever made. It reminds me of the time me and my family were traveling along Loch Ness in Scotland when all of the sudden we stumbled across this guy in a stupid Dinos...SORRY AGAIN FOLKS. THE PERSON THAT SACKED THE PERSON WHO SACKED THE FIRST PERSON HAS JUST BEEN SACKED BY MY GOOD FRIEND ANTONIO, WHO WILL FINISH THE REVIEW FOR US.El Buyo thiso filmo! You'll sureo enjoyo! Grado: A+o,"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BLU RAY DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't know how long Amazon has been advertising this DVD available for pre order but it seems like forever.I have the non Blu Ray version and it's a really good transfer so I couldn't wait to see how fabulous it lookedon Blu Ray.Well it finally got here and I watched it...or tried to! The picture was horrible the film grain was worse than the Zapurter film!If that wasn't bad enough the sound wasn't any good either and for good measure the DVD locked up on me but onlyonce!I played the regular DVD right after watching the Blu Ray and without question the quality is MUCH better. The picture isn't anywhere near as grainy, the contrast is much better and the sound is better. I haven't been this disappointed over the tranfer of a Blu Ray Dvd since Die Hard.Buy the regular version and stay away from this piece of gargabe."
1,Defective DVD,This disc can experience the following problem: Captioning that appears on screen regardless of what you select in the subtitles option. This disc has RCE (Regional Coding Enhancement) which may be the culprit. There is a site that addresses the RCE issue but the corrections shown there do not fix this problem. This problem does not happen with all DVD players so it's a crap shoot as to whether or not it will play properly for you. I suggest you just buy TSNKE (Thou Shalt Not Kill Except) on DVD instead. (...)you can send the insert cover to the director and he will sign it for you!
5,Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition),"I just love Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition). It's hillarious and I would reccomend this movie for teens who just want something funny that they understand. I got this movie NEW at a really cheap price and it came earlier than I expected. When I opened the movie, it worked great and so did the second disc. I hope you enjoy this movie just as much as I did."
4,Classic,"What is there to say about this, except that this is a classic. Great extra stuff with the DVD and as usual a comical movie from beginning to end. What you would expect form Monty Python."
4,Definitive Monty Python.,"Classic Monty Python. You'll never get tired of watching it. Dozens of classic bits like Bring Out Your Dead, The Black Knight and I'll Fart In Your General Direction."
3,Poor Translation,"This DVD does nothing to take advantage of the DVD format. There are only a few trailers, which I'm sure come on the video. A dissapointing translation of a wonderful film."
3,A disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this movie, given all the great things I'd heard about it. But for me, it was only ""okay"". The opening sequences were funny, the killer rabbit was good (though I had seen a clip of it before), the Black Knight scene was good, and the bridge sequence was hilarious. But I found much of the film impenetrable, unfunny, and sleep-inducing. I also don't understand the Python crew's obsession with casting each of the players in multiple roles, which I found confusing. I was surprised that the Camelot sequence was so short, I didn't get the inclusion of the modern police subplot, or the way it led to the aborted ending. I know I'm probably in the minority on this, but that's how I feel. To each his own."
5,Simply the BEST of Monty Python!,"King Arthur! The legend of the Holy Grail! Stories that by themselves reach out to our imaginations ... then comes along Monty Python to turn it all into swiss cheese (or perhaps brie). Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle and Michael Palin all do a superb job as Arthur and the Knights (pronounced ""K-nnnnn-iggits!"" by the French) of the Round Table running about the countryside on their quest for that most holy of holies ... the Holy Grail! The movie is full of witty banter, insightful quips on government (and the people involved), and of course the usually delightful sexual inuendo that only the MP troupe can spin off with the straightest of faces. This is the cream of MP's crop of equally delightful movies! Buy it! Or we shall taunt you a second time!"
5,We're Knights of the round table...,"I must say, I agree with Amazon's review of the film. I'd never even seen any of the sketches before I watched the Holy Grail and Life of Brian. Thank the heavens that this is NOT a rare film! With such quotable quotes as ""It's just a flesh wound"" and the ever remembered ""Ni!"" and the catchy ""Knights of the round table"" it's not hard to see why this was re-released. Stuck-up ninnies like Leonard Maltin who will stick to their classic black-and-white Bogarts will say things such as ""For fans"". Leonard Maltin can go to Antarctica as a ""Penguin on the telly"" as far as I'm concerned. Don't listen to him. Listen to the EXPERTS at Amazon. Did they not put it under ""Essential Videos""? Watch it! Buy it! Whatever! Just enjoy the thing! And if you could get me a shrubbery while you're at it, that would be nice."
2,FANTASTIC film. WOEFUL dvd.,"THG is classic Python with laughs a minute and insightful satire a-plenty. That said, let me emphasize that the low rating I give this DVD has nothing to do with the film itself.However, how the marketers can get by calling this a ""Deluxe"" anything is beyond me. Not only are there no extras (forgivable), the quality of the transfer is atrocious. Sure, it looks better than my VHS copy, and for that I'm grateful. But there was no attempt made to clean up simply things like dust and fiber from the print. In addition the sound is mastered at a volume that is too low to do much with. Any other disc I watch, my system rattles the room. With this disc, the volume was up to 11, and a room of 5 people had trouble hearing the shouting.Very disappointing."
4,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"British comedy is funnier than anything else in the world. The extras are great, too. I recommend the Hard of Hearing and Uses for Coconuts."
5,:D,I bought this for my husband because it is his all time favorite movie. I was a little disappointed that when it came the DVD wasn't secured into the snap in the middle of the case. But it wasn't damaged or scratched and played beautifully. Funny as ever!
4,monty python review,"I bought this movie to replace the physical copy I had a few years ago that doesn't work anymore, and I was happy with the quality."
4,Hysterical,"I really like comedies and I really like Monty Python. 2+2=4. I loved this flick. Not only is it one of the funniest ever, but easily the best Python film. See this movie and prepare to laugh."
5,Screamingly funny,"In a previous life, I got a Ph.D. in medieval literature. If you know anything at all about the Arthurian legends, you'll find this film doubly hilarious: the Pythons actually used a lot of motifs straight out of the tales (e.g., the castle of women) and gave them their own special, twisted treatment. They're fearlessly irreverent (the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch had me rolling on the floor), and even if some of the jokes (e.g. the non-horses) get a little old after a while, there's so much wildly original material that you're too busy laughing to care. Stuffed shirts beware: you'll laugh till your stuffing comes out your nose!"
3,Glad it's on DVD finally.,"If you've been waiting for this movie on dvd, get it. The extras are no big deal, honestly. The movie quality looks good though. I'm glad I bought it."
1,5 stars for the movie--1 star for the DVD,"This is an excellent movie, but the DVD edition is awful. There are numerous defects in the DVD. The worst problem is that subtitles appear even when they are turned off. I know that there are supposed to be subtitles during the credits as a joke--but I'm talking about ALL THROUGH THE FILM!! The company that released this movie is doing nothing to correct this problem--so steer clear. I returned my copy and bought the older edition of the DVD on Ebay--It is a great movie when subtitles aren't popping up every few seconds! (this problem doesn't occur on all DVD players-but it does show up on most including almost all SONY players)."
2,Quality not movie,This is a classic movie that I love but I gave it two stars because the QUALITY of the video is substandard.. I would expect this from a bootleg site not from a legitimate site. It will make me think twice about ordering another digital movie from here again.
3,"Great movie, Bad Transfer","This transfer is from an extremely dark print of the movie. Many of the visual details are lost in the muck. Avoid this version, buy the ""Special Edition"" for the same price. The image is better, and the extra features are great."
3,Why only widescreen???,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. BUT- already having the tape and getting the DVD for Christmas was a disappointment. I suppose that I am one of the few people that do not own a widescreen TV and find looking at a movie through a slit very annoying. In this case, the ability to select favorite scenes on the DVD is compromised by losing about 30% of the picture. Why is there no full screen version available, not only on this, but on many other classic films?? Anyone have the answer to this?"
3,"My least favorite Python film, but still good!","After reading all of the rave reviews for this movie, I finally decided to give it a try. The only other Python film I had seen was The Meaning of Life, and I was expecting this one to top it. However, I became disappointed with the results. Now, I'm a hard core Monty Python fan and consider this my least favorite. This movie had a large ego to live up to, and I think it fell short. (Note: I saw this film on VHS) Below are my pros and cons on Monty Python and the Holy Grail:**PROS***Most of the jokes can be quite funny*Good storyline*Great acting**CONS***TERRIBLE picture quality and sound*Not enough of my favorite Python, Eric Idle*NO SONGS?Well, there you have it. Recommended, but beware."
1,NOT A DVD!,"This is depressing - I bought this movie for a friend, and when she opened it, there was only one disc inside and it was just the special features, no movie. Why did Amazon have to advertise it incorrectly as a special edition 2-disc set? I'm very disappointed."
5,"simply amazing, halarious, and kewl","this is an amazing movie if you like comady, you are going to love this movie, and dont forget to watch out for death, with its white fur, and big pointy teath, (the killer rabbit). Buy the movie and find out more about camellot, the knights of the round table,and the trojan bunny. i guarante you WILL love this movie. infact all of the monty python movies and series would make a perfict gift."
5,"Oh Geez, Where to Begin?","I'm trying not to gush here. I know I've said that before, but I am a girl with a thing for dead parrots. (...) I think that anyone who doesn't like the film must have something wrong with them. Who cares about the plot? It's the Pythons, for heaven's sake, of course it won't make sense! For fans only! Hah! I was weaned from Saturday Night Live on this stuff! This film is the reason I became a fan! I can't really review the plot here, as the film's really not got one. It's supposed to be about King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Then it becomes somewhat of a cross between a Python episode, and T.H. White's ""the Once and Future King"". Funny, yet, all the same, staying true to its theme of King Arthur and the Knights of the round table. ""Between our quests, we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable""..."
4,Amazing remaster,"I don't know if they spent all this time remastering this movie or if I always saw it on overused videotapes. The pictures are clear and the colors are brillant. The sound is crisp. Nothing like I remember the movie.The extras are almost worth the price of admission alone. There is a lot of new and old material. The best being the sing alongs, the lego scenes, and the Japanese version. There is also the standard commentary and interviews stuff if that interests you."
4,PURE COMIC GENIUS!,"(...)Well all I have to say to that is you do not know the meaning of comidy you cheesy second hand electric donkey bottom biter!I mean,really if you look comedy up in the dictionary it will read as follows: MONTY PYTHON and the HOLY GRAIL.See? Now I've made my point that this is the best movie is themovie in the comic genre that is known by mankind. The special edition DVD has two discs the first of the movie and the second of the special features. On the special features if you go to the singalongs and go to the lego knights if you are a true MONTY PYTHON fan you will engoy the brief little somthing from the television show... hint hint nudge nudge wink wink (the parrot scetch). The only reason I give this movie four stars instead of five is because of the ending(you'll see what I mean). I think I've said enough,but keep in mind that this is a great movie (one of the best)."
5,Comedy doesn't get much better than this,"This is my favorite album of all time. From Bring Out Your Dead, to the castle anthrax, this dvd will keep you laughing the whole time. The features are sweet too. check out the LEGO version of the song ""Camelot"". I reccomend this to any comedy fan"
1,Not a DVD!!!!!!,"What a rip off! This is my very first bad experience with Amazon. Heck, this is the first time I haven't been extremely satisfied.Who in the world would purposely order a PSP disc of ANY movie?????? The heading for this item still incorrectly states that it is a two (2) disc set. It does not mention that it is in some stange format no one in their right mind would buy. You can imagine my surprise when I opened the case and found what looked like some kind of strange contraceptive device. Don't order this!"
1,Bad mistake from Amazon,I ordered the new 2 DVD disc special extraordinarly edition and I received this crappy PSP version! Incredible mistake and bad service from Amazon!!!
1,This Is The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"This movie was so boring, that I fell asleep during it!!! I don't understand how anyone could possibly like it. Not only is it stupid, but it reeked! I rather watch Barney then this movie."
1,monty python and the holy grail,"It is a terrible PG movie. I checked this out from my local publick library to view with my two kids (11 & 10) during the holiday season. I got it because it is rated PG. We kept watching and waiting for a funny good story but none. Instead, we got many words not appropriate for kids, such as, oral sex. We adults were shocked to hear those words. Who did the rating of this movie!? Bad for family with kids."
1,Good Grief,"Without a doubt, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was so dull; it literally put me to sleep. Even the ending was lame. I don't understand why they even bothered making such a stupid movie in the first place.I especially don't understand why so many people think this film is so fabulous. I mean, come on, guys, what's the overall point of the movie? What's the general theme?Anyway, if you've read this entire review, and if you still want to purchase this DVD, that's your own choice to make. But I'm staying as far away from this movie (and anything else related to Monty Python) as humanly possible."
1,horibile,I love spoofs but this was just dreadful it is the worst movie i ever have seen so dum so boring and so horific it was gaisley never wach it I almost cried it was so horible.if I COULD I WOULDINT EVEN GIVE IT ONE STAR i WOULD DO 0
1,so overrated,"whiny voices and annoying intonation; why do they talk like that? and the whole thing is way too silly, the jokes are too unpredictable, there's no plot, just a collection of little low budget sketches that are immensely pointless. I really don't get it, why is this movie so popular? It is definintely not for everyone.Doctor strangelove and young frankenstein are comedy movies that deserve their reputation and status, as for this one, it really pales in comparison and it seems so amateurish and jovenile. Kids in a highschool could've come up with something better."
5,One of the Funniest Movies of all Time,"This is probably my favorite movie my friend has the whole thing memorized and can do the whole movie in the car with all the different voices an gestures. I love this movie and I recomend that you buy is the widescreen is better because you can see the whole thing when is says ""The Quest for the Holy Grail"""
5,Sorry I can't give this movie 100 stars!,This is the funniest movie ever... period.My wife would not agree. Maybe it's a guy-thing.Hey Amazon - negative reviews from 12 years ago are not helpful. Can't you purge the reviews after so long?
5,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"I saw this when I was a teenager, and I was probably drunk. So, how does it hold up, after the fanfare? Quite well, thank you very much. Silly as heck and I laughed out loud repeatedly. It's still a damn fine film."
4,DEATH RUN TO ISTANBUL,I realized this was a low no budget picture and I was amazed it was shot on Hi 8 video even back in 1993. The quality stood up and the action was fast paced and exciting. There were a lot of good actors in this film which shows me the director picked the best out of the talent that doesn't work much in Hollywood.The Venice scene was funI recommend it as viewing fun and also to anyone wanting to make movies.
3,Works but you only get 3,These Flat jig heads work but you only get 3 in a package. The paint seems durable and the eyelets were not painted over which was nice.
4,An Ok Start For a Great Series,"Told in the very distance future, cowboy bebop is about the adventures of a group of bounty hunters, now for those who arent familiar with the series a bounty hunter is someone who captures people that the government has a ransom on them. In these episodes we are introduced to characters such as Spike (the main character) and faye valentine. The first few episodes are nice but nothing out of this world, the main reason i would reccomend buying this dvd is for episode 5 which from my point of view is a masterpiece, the story and animation in this episode are the some of the best in the series. I highly recommend checking out this dvd, you wont be wasting your time.Every manga fan should have a copy of this."
2,"Remix, we dont need no stinking remix !",Does anyone else have horrible sound quality on their Remix #1 disk ? I thought this was supposed to be a remix for better sound and I hear all kinds of screaching and poping on the audio on the disk I bought.Great Anime series - Horrible dvd sound quality.
5,A new must have classic!,"I brought this title along with my new DVD player, and right away i knew i was hooked for good! The opening theme song alone will put you in the mood to enjoy Spike, Jet, and faye run rapport in space...buy this dvd and enjoy!!!"
4,Probably the most mature anime yet,"Cowboy bebop is a marvellous anime series featuring 4 very well made, integrated characters, remarkably beautiful artwork and an awsome jazzy soundtrack. The episodes are self standing and as the story progresses, they are combined to form an excellent storyline describing the formation of a group of bounty hunters, consisting of Spike, an extremely cool individualist, Jet, a very likeable and caring guy, Faye, a fit beyond belief female, and Ed, a naive, energetic girl (and their dog, Ed). Hounted by their tragic pasts, they all seek their personal salvation, while the viewer is provided with sporadic references about each one's history. Action, humour, sorrow and hope, all there for you to enjoy, in this anime which should be instantly added to your manga collections."
1,What's the point?,"I already have Cowboy Bebop vol. 1. Why on Earth would I want to shell out another 30 bones just for ""cleaner"" animation and ""enhanced"" sound? I don't know either. The show had a good run, but the constant rereleases, boxsets, and best of sets *coughcheapgimickscoughcough* are starting to kill my interest in the series. This is just Bandai milking an aging franchise that should simply be laid to rest"
4,I'm reviewing the product I selected!,"And I must say...it's a show that is well worth the $$. An exceptional story and some of the best animation that I've ever seen!Here's the only reason why we go from 5 to 4 stars. Bless there hearts, the writing from overseas just doesn't have the same appeal to me as shows and television from the states. They tend to be disjointed and take too many things for granted. I live for the day that someone doesn't just adapt an overseas anime but in fact writes it and then recruits an animation team.That would be a five star animated series!"
5,"Different from the rest, but standing tall","Cowboy Bebop is about two Bounty Hunters and their antics through space. One thing is obvious from the start. This film has some style that lacks in other anime films. A style that makes him seem like a futuristic cowboy (that's not supposed to sound goofy, alright?). The humor is great, and better than your average Japanese perv and angry girl humor. No, this humor is sharp and sarcastic. The animation is excellent as well, being surprisingly smooth for a TV show, especially at the occaisional battle scene. You should definately pick up this DVD and if you don't like it, just give it to a friend."
5,one of the best anime out there,"Cowboy Bebop is full of action, suspense, and humor. It is a great series filled with original characters and plots. You'll never look at anime the same way again after you watch cowboy bebop. If you have never seen anime before, there is no better way to start. As for anime fans, trigun is another show very similar to cowboy bebop. You might want to check that out too."
4,Wait for the real Remix of Cowboy Bebop,"The only great thing about this is the audio quality. It is now 5.1 surround.the video quality is pretty much the same. but another cowboy bebop dvd set is coming out, where the Video has been remastered and cleaned up, and it'll have the 5.1 surround. so just wait for that release."
3,Episode 5 is the best in this volume!,"I was amazed with the last episode in this volume. The story definetly got darker with the appearance of Vicious and Spike's past. Otherwise the first 4 eps were a bit slow for me but overall a nice introduction. The reason why I gave it a 3 is because the intro part (1-4) didn't take my breath away. However, I can't wait to watch volume 2 just to find out more about Spike's past. That part of the story looks really promising. =) Also, the dubbing is actually pretty good. The music and animation is great. The animation is consistent rather than how some animators get lazy (ex/ Fushigi Yuugi)."
3,It gets better :),"The DVD is not your typical mayhem and violence animes. Rather it a little like a jack-in-the-box type; you don't quite know what new suprises are packed into each new episode. I rated as 3 stars becos I kinda Lukeware about the 1st installment, but as I am now watching the 2nd DVD (waiting for my 3, 4, 5th installaments :)) my enthusiasm is growing; while I won't get all excited for nothing too soon, I must say that I am pretty excited about each new episode that I watch. The humour and occasionally philosophical 'brushes' are kinda fresh; each episode has something that makes me laugh and sympathise with the characters at the a same time. Each episode just gets better. :) BTW, the music is great; I just got the OST Cowboy Bebop V2."
5,"Truly great in both style, music and neatness!",This is a series I bought on a fluke. I didn't knew much about it. It sounded cool when I read a review of it on animeondvd.com. I think I bought the first 2 volumes and they were SO good. The animation style perfectly fits the mood in the series and don't even get me started on the music. Yummy! Please get this. You will not regret it. It oozes quality and style wrapped up in a nice pakage.
3,fun,"Having been to Mexico on holiday Azu Azul was one of the great musical experiences. la bomba topped the list while being there, and it definately deserve more attention outside mexico as well."
1,don't buy it for la Bomba,"I don't know much about Latin music, but I really enjoy listening and dancing to it. I had heard of La Bomba (the hit), so I took a risk and bought the album. I was really disappointed with the tracks. Most sound like tacky repeative songs played at huge discotheques in the summer, with a few farts noises thrown in!I guess that's what you get if you buy an album for a popular song heard over the summer, and even La Bomba is wearing thin..."
5,Loved it,Was a passenger in a van travelling across Central America when the driver put this CD in the player. It was perfect. Most of it is in English and it sums up the rythm of that part of the world. Never heard these guys before but I love their music!!
4,You can't help but dance,This is an amazing party CD! A Bolivian group from Santa Cruz de la Sierra that has been a local and international hit for several years. You cannot help but dance to this contagious beat that comes with dance moves of its own. As contagious as the lambada but certainly a milenium sound. This will not be the last we hear of Azul Azul.
4,Azul Azul is from Bolivia,"No offense to the Danish reviewer, but just so that everyone knows, Azul Azul is from Bolivia, not Mexico. It's a huge feat for a Bolivian band, and they play wonderful dance music, heard throughout the world. Definitely buy this CD."
5,Very comfortable,I bought this to replace my old original Canon 5D strap. This one is wider and more comfortable than the original. I'm going to buy it for all my cameras!
5,Excellent Strap,Must have strap for comfort. Now i don't feel like I am lugging around sometimes 40D + 530 EX + 70-200 4L lens. Definitely helps
4,Better than the original strap from Nikon,I like the strap because it is more comfortable than the original strap from Nikon. Does what it is supposed to do.
4,Very comfortable strap!,This OP/TECH strap is a great alternative the the straps normally included with cameras. It distributes the weight evenly and is very comfortable. More than worth the price.
4,camera strop op/tech pro loop,"I bought this for my canon G7 after killing my neck on vacation with the included strap.The problem with the G7 is the opening for any camera strap is only 1/4 "" vs. most straps, including this, are 3/8"".I solved this by finding some slip rings at the local hard ware and slipping it through that. I wish they would ship this product with some rings.Otherwise my neck is very happy and I like the length. It is not too long , so lessing bumping of camera around."
4,Good but nothing special,"Has the job done better than the original Pentax 2000 or K-x straps but I don't feel a real weight redistribution with Sigma 70-200mm F2.8 and other heavy lenses. Guess depends on your body type:-) Ended up unstrapping the neoprene upper part and using only the shorter narrow nylon part. Fits perfectly under the armpit, the camera stays put and quite surprisingly this leftover mini-strap doesn't cut into the shoulder.For the long strap I prefer 1"" Domke GRIPPER - very simple construction, non-slip, breathable, lightweight and compact. Can be adjusted as a ""pap-strap"" for candids. Using with Canon 7D and 70-200mm F4 IS lens and every time I take it out, I can't stop wondering how they made this little gem. Compare both in a store and decide which one works better for you."
5,neck strap,"very comfortable when fitted to the heavy camera I have,takes the strain off your neck,recommend it to everyone."
5,Great strap!,I used this for the first time today for the Worldwide Photo Walk. Two and one half hours with the camera around my neck and it worked great. I would recommend this item for anyone who uses a dslr.
5,Nice and comfy,"I got this strap to replace the kit one that I got with my Nikon D90. This one is much more comfortable for long trips/photo sessions. I was a little worried when I saw the connectors on each side, but they have never come close to coming apart while I was using the strap.I just wish it were somehow a little smaller--so it would fit better in the holster-style case I bought. But I think the bulk comes with the territory if you want a secure and comfortable strap."
2,Padded portion too short,"I'm not sure what it is about after-market straps, but they all seem to have padded areas that are too short to effectively carry a camera slung over one's back. The strap that came with my 5DMKII is perfectly suitable in this regard, albeit lacking some padding. When I sling my camera over my back using the OP/TECH strap, the buckle ends up right over my shoulder. Not good. It's a sturdy strap, but it could use some improvement."
3,"Good, but not great!","Much better than the supplied Sony strap that came with my Alpha, but not what I would call perfect. I wish it had more cushion for my neck."
2,Was expecting a softer padding,"I returned mine today. I was looking for a much softer neck padding with rounder edges but instead got a stiff one with straight edges. Perhaps the padding will get more flexible with use but I just can't wait for that to happen. I will try to look for something with a softer, ""foamy-feel"" neck padding. I also agree with the other comments about the length. An additional 4 to 6 inches would have been ideal."
5,Save your neck,"So happy I bought it. Help my neck to feel lighter with a very heavy DSLR.Also with the pro loop, it's very good for your camera."
2,Not A Pro Strap - Far From It,"Item I got was the OP/TECH USA 1511372 Pro Loop Strap - neoprene (Steel).First all this strap is to light weight for any real Pro camera and lens combo.It does not with stand the weight of a Pro DSLR like the Canon 1D X.Not sure why OP/TECH is charging $20.00 xx for this crap, I mean strap?Cost should be around $8.00 or $9.00...OP/TECH makes the Canon CPS Pro strap that I have and that strap is 900x better in every way.It is a complete Pro Grade Strap, so you would think that OP/TECH would make a strap like thatto sell in their own line up.. ???I would not recommend this strap to any Pro Camera Owner. Look somewhere other than this strap."
4,Good for carrying camera for long times,"This strap helps a lot when you'll be carrying a heavy camera for longer periods of time. It definitely is a better choice than the stock strap that came with my camera.I don't do much tripod shooting, but I can see that it would not be a great choice for those who do--the part of the strap that remains attached to the camera when you take off the neck strap is long enough to be a bother on a tripod.I am hoping the strap will get more comfortable with use because the padded area that falls along my neck is quite stiff and doesn't conform to my neck as well as I'd hoped. I do think it'll break in over time, though obviously I can't be certain of that yet."
4,"Good quality, comfortable strap","If you're looking for a quality replacement to the stock strap on your new camera or binoculars the OP/TECH is a good product to check out. My biggest complaint is that it is to short to sling diagonal across my chest. Based on the measurements I thought it was about the same length as my Nikon D80's included strap but its actually 3-4"" shorter which does make a difference.Some reviewers have noted concerns about the clips potential for coming un-done. I've used this strap for about a month and a half and haven't had the problem.50% lighter claim - I disagree, it is more comfortable than the stock Nikon strap I was using because it is broader and thicker. I find that while more comfortable I also 'know its there' more due to the width of the strap.All told, a good strap. I'd prefer it to be 4-6"" longer for across body use but it gets the job done."
4,Very Comfortable Strap!,"I bought one of these straps for both myself and my sister-in-law, and we are both enjoying them immensely. They are comfortable enough so that we may carry the camera around for hours on end with no neck fatigue."
4,great strap,"Love this strap! It is very comfortable and durable. only complaint would be that it makes my neck sweaty when its real hot out, because the fabric is not breathable."
1,SO SAD IT WAS SO BAD,"I was very eager to get this dvd and yes, it did take a couple of weeks to receive it. When I ordered it there was no reviews. The age of the performers were not important because a true rocker never dies inside. BEWARE THIS DVD IS A RIP-OFF ... screen is jumping and music and voices are out of sync. Yes, you could keep for the soundtrack but that it isn't why I purchased it. Being recorded in 2004 you should expect a good recording. DISAPPOINTED ---returning product."
2,Very Disappointing!,"I was hoping for a remake of the sixties classic. This was recorded at a concert in 2004 (a bunch of old men). I don't have anything against ""old men"" . . . I am one myself . . . but watching them play ""heavy rock"" doesn't work. Sorry, the song wasn't up to standards. Worst of all, it had frequent video pauses throughout, lasting just a fraction of a second, but distracting. I think they were made intentionally for ""artistic"" purpose, but I my opinion, they were an irritant! The track list is:Iron Butterfly ThemeUnconscious PowerStone BelieverFlowers and BeadsEasy Rider (Let the Wind Pay the Way)Buttlefly BleuIn-A-Gadda-Da-VidaExtra bonus tracks: (recorded in 1997)In the Time of Our LiveWhispers in the WindInterview: Steve Howe (of Yes) discussing Iron Butterfly."
1,Poor quality,"I am not happy with this product. The video is out of sync with the audio. The DVD stops and is interrupted. I read about this from other reviewers but thought I would buy anyway because they had received defective copies. Apparently all of the copies of this dvd are defective. I will be returning this unless Amazon can ship me a good dvd that really works.Paul CrummellParadise NewfoundlandCanadaP.S.I have bought this product twice and paid for it twice. A new copy and a used copy. Both are defective. I have tried to find ways to contact you by telephone, so that I can obtain a working copy of this DVD.Please provide info to me so that I can return the 2 defective copies and obtain a working copy if there is such a thing.Paul.10225@hotmail.com"
4,Beautiful quality pictures,"I bought a generic lens and the Panasonic lens for my Lumix LX5. You can definitively tell the difference. The Panasonic lens produces far crisper pictures. I sent the generic back. Some things you pay good money for quality, shoes and lens."
1,Nice Theories But Not Practical,Most of the ideas presented in this book are borrowed from Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP). The author tried to apply NLP principles in an unstructured manner that was confusing to read. It's as if the book is written for kinestic people who can never sit still or talk logically. More practical examples are need to demonstrate the concepts in the book.
1,Worst So-Called NLP Book,There are two problems with this book: (1) Unedited English and unfocused writing and (2) claiming to be NLP when it's not. Don't waste your money on this bad joke. There are better NLP books out there.
1,A Poor Choice for Trainers,"Well, I don't know how the author is capable of in class or how he can handle students in challenging situations. I can only judge the book based on my reading. Out of the many trainer/teacher books I have read, this is the worst one. First, it's extremely hard to comprehend, and second, it's too biased in its application.As good trainers can tell you classroom management is more than just applying a few psychological tricks. It requires a great deal of instructional design, good materials, comfortable environment, etc.The best teacher I have ever had is the one who cares and willing to go the extra miles. Do I get this out of this grinding book? Of course, not."
5,Love 'em,"Have been using this product for years and I love it. Have periodically tried other eye pencils and none compare for quality, ease of application, ease of removal, and just plain good looks."
5,Easy Listening,Linda Ronstadt and the Nelson Riddle Ochestra CD is just the right mix of hum-along easy listening music. Just right for anyone!
3,disappointed in this CD,I like Linda Rhonstadt and have other CD's by her. But this CD has only one good song on it---What's new. It is great! But the rest of the songs sounded grade B to me. I would not recommend this CD.
4,The real star of this album is Nelson Riddle,"Linda Ronstadt took a fair amount of grief when she did this album in 1983. Keep in mind that for much of the late 70s, she was selling out huge concert venues as Britney Spears does today (the difference is that Linda can sing well). ""What's New"" was quite a departure for her. However, it holds up well as did the third album of standards with Riddle. This great conductor and arranger has handled most of Frank Sinatra's best work. He died in the mid-80s, but his legacy remains. The songs on this album are gorgeously orchestrated. Linda's voice is well suited for the songs, though having seen her in concert in the last five years, she does them better now."
2,WHAT'S NEW got old in a hurry,"I have been a Linda Ronstadt fan for a long time, but I don't like everything she's done. In fact, after GET CLOSER, I went seven years (!) before getting another new album of hers. WHAT'S NEW, while it garnered a great deal of attention when it was released (some very positive, some far less so), has not aged very well. Yes, it's a well-meant attempt to revive the standards of the big-band era in the age of MTV. But she probably lost as many fans as she gained by making this album and the four that followed, and I almost became one of them. Sorry Linda, you're a great singer, but you're not perfect."
1,What's New,"Waited so long to find this CD and when I put it on, it skipped part of the first song and part of the second. This must be a CD that was used. I would prefer to pay top dollar for a new CD."
5,The classics hold up!,"The CD plays great. These classic songs harkin back to the late 40s. The Nelson Riddle arraigment uses a natural full ochestral sound, complimenting the talents of Linda Ronstadt.Her rich vocalization is par to Day, Fitzgerald, Clooney, or Horne. It sends you back to another time and another America. Of corner diners, early morning milk deliveries, martinis at noon, and walks in the park. This album sounds like it would have been played on the ""Hit Parade."" There is not a bad song on it. I thoght so 30 years ago, when I first heard it, and I still do. The classics hold up, and so does the talent. I recommend this album, to anyone who believes that."
5,beautiful,this is a really nice album. sound quality is first rate. linda's voice is crystal clear. If you like her sound and you like standards this is for you!
4,I knew I would like it,"I like putting this CD on when the weather's cool and rainy and there's a fire in the fire place. I think, though, I would have prefered a little less brightness in the tone, and something more to differentiate the tracks, however, all in all, much more satisfying then most CD's when listened to from start to finish, which is saying alot."
5,Excellent Service,Linda Rondstandt with The Nelson Riddle Orchestra is ONE of my favorite albums. I rec'd the Whats New Cd in a very timely manner.
3,"It's ""okay"" but not as great as others have rated it","Linda Ronstadt has performed in various musical genres and she has done very well in each. There's no problem with her performances in this genre. She does fine. But the glitch is that all the material here has been better performed before. Virtually every song on this disc is on other recordings in my collection and every one of them is better when done by someone else.If you're new to the material or you're a Ronstadt fanatic, you will be happy with this disc. If you've heard it all before, you've heard it better done--so don't bother."
4,EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS AND SONGS- good singing!,"Superb songs. Linda's singing is good and very emotional enough but it is obvious that she is new to this material. She does not have the interpretive skills of Streisand, Fitzgerald or Holliday.Nelson sounds as good as ever and there is no question that even Frank's ghost is evident in these recordings."
5,Gira is still creating great music after all of these years,"Michael Gira should be bigger than most of his contemporaries. In fact, he should have hit it big with Swans years ago for creating a truly original, unrelenting sound. However, it is an indisputable fact that the mainstream prefers a watered down, easily accessible sound as opposed to music that is actually challenging. Gira's one and only major label release, The Burning World, proved to be a commercial failure. In many ways, The Angels of Light continue down the path that The Burning World opened up. And while Swans explored the depths of different textures of sound, The Angels of Light strips everything down to the most basic and intimate levels. With that said, Gira has become a fine singer/songwriter."
5,not what i expected,"it has a cheap look,poor material quality both strap and buckle,i was expecting it to be a little wider."
3,I don't think this is good for beginners,"I used this book to refresh my memory because I hadn't done any web programming in a while. It worked just fine for that, but I don't think I'd have any idea what was going on if I approached this book without prior knowledge. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for absolute beginners. This book is best for people who need review or as a supplement to other books on the subject."
2,Just not worth it,"I had to use this book for a class and it was extremely disappointing. Don't expect Deitel to explain the code examples very well, and expect to get confused and led-on.There is some useful scripting content, but absolutely lousy at teaching anything to someone who doesn't know it already. The book does NOT teach XHTML or XML. You will not read this book and come out with a decent understanding of XHTML or XML at all.This book is an over-complicated tour of internet scripting. It really should have focused more on Javascript, VBScript and XHTML than anything else.Deitel & Deitel should learn how to teach, then their books would be really good."
5,Internet & World Wide Web How to Program,"I recently used your Programming for the Internet book and Cyber Classroom (""Internet & World Wide Web - How to Program"" by Deitel, Deitel & Nieto) for a course that I took a few months ago and it was a tremendous help. I really enjoyed the tools that are employed in each course, which helps students grasp the material from several sources. I would read a section and then listen to Paul lecture on the same material. No wonder you guys are the leaders in the industry. The bar has definitely been raised, and I don't see anyone near you. Keep making those great books and material."
5,I read this book a long time ago and it still sticks with me,"I read this book six years ago when I was in middle school. It really sticks with you. This books is about young lady who is torn between keeping her virginity and losing her virginity, morals and things that are not so moral, a guy who is good looking, and has it all. And a guy who is equally good looking and he is encouraging her to do the right thing. Its a tough situation for this girl. I encourage all young kids to read this book because it so good and it really brings to light about sex and love and hormones. Melody Carlson really brings teenage hood to life. I love this book. This book is the reason why I have so many morals. Melody Carlson books are the kind that stick with you and don't let you go. Also these books talk about faith and love and the love that Jesus Christ has for all of us. I loved this book and I think you will too.Thank you."
2,Wanted to be better,"It's a post-apocalyptic story, with a different political party on each side of the apocalypse. The earth is all but destroyed. The reclamation requires further devastation, in the short term, and that's where the story takes place.It just does't come across as strongly as it should have. The good guys are poor but honest farmers. The bad guys' downfall is their greed for gold. Sarah's transport from one episode to the next is the comic sidekick, just a little too eager for the next dollar. Good stories can be made from such ordinary pieces, but it takes a little more skill than I saw here.The line drawing is competent. In fact, the scenery stole the show in most of the underground panels. There appears to be some ink-wash drawing in the first few pages. Sad to say, the coarse half-tone screen lost all of the subtlety that the artist put in originally.""Mother Sarah"" is readable, even enjoyable, just not memorable."
2,Camilla,"I found this book rather dissapointing. It was depressing and didn't really make me want to keep reading. When I finally got through it, it was an okay book but not up to Madeline L'Engle's standards. The book ""And Both Were Young"" was much more satisfying."
2,"Worth a look, but otherwise...","This book is dissapointing and the parts where Camilla takes a drink when she's too young, and when her mother cuts herself, are distrubing. This is definitely not a children's novel. It tends to go along very slowly and dully, and has a very dissatisfying ending. It is sweet, tender, and witty in points and has some good parts. It is worth a look, but not as good as L'Engle's other books."
4,Very good book!,"I read Camillia and couldn't put it down ,but the end was kind of disapointing. There needed to be a second one. would recommend this book for all ages."
4,"O.K., but not one of my favourite L'Engle books","Took me a couple tries to actually finish it, although it was better the second time. It you like romance, read it. Not a gigantic, complex, plot structure, but okay."
3,Teen Angst Never Changes,"""Camilla"" is actually between 3 and 4 stars for me. I had never heard of this L'Engle book before so I was interested to read it.""Camilla"" was different from the other L'Engle books I've read (ie: ""Wrinkle in TIme"" series). Not surprisingly the main character is named Camilla. The book deals with her emotions as she witnesses her mother's attraction to a man that's not her father, her friendship with her girlfriend, and her first attraction to a young man.L'Engle did a good job describing the conflicting emotions that we all harbor when we are young. I don't know what it's like to live in a home where a marriage has been in trouble, but I had no problem relating to Camilla's thoughts and emotions as described in a book.Although the book was first published in 1951, the feelings the characters in the book had are still relevant for today.I have to say I loved the ""Wrinkle in Time"" series better than this book, but they really are entirely different."
4,Interesting family interactions,"I am a Madeline fan and always enjoy her books and own many of them. When I started reading this one it seemed to be a good one to share with my early teen granddaughters but as I read on I realized it is really for late teens or young adults. As Camilla learns more about life, love, friendship and family conflicts she grows in maturity and finding her place in the world. I loved the part where she realizes that she is really an individual and has her own place in the world and that others do also. This takes great insight at her age and certainly will help her as she matures."
4,decent,"Camilla is a good read even if I hate the ending. I was never sure it had ended wrong until I read A House Like a Lotus and that book proved that Camilla did not end up with Frank, how anoying."
5,Enthusiastically recommended for listeners of all ages,"Camilla is the unabridged audiobook adaptation of a novel by Madeleine L'Engle, the author of the widely beloved classic ""A Wrinkle in Time"". Fifteen-year-old Camilla Dickinson has long lived a sheltered life, but when her parents' marriage begins to fail, she's caught in the middle of emotional turmoil. She becomes close to Frank, her best friend's brother, and the one person she can really talk to about life, death, God, and her aspiration to become an astronomer. They travel the streets of New York City together, and Frank introduces her to a world of people she'd never met or known before - but will her first love end as badly as the dying love between her parents? Superbly narrated by Ann Marie Lee, who has appeared in numerous television shows including ""ER"", ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"", and ""Nip/Tuck"", Camilla is enthusiastically recommended for listeners of all ages and public library audiobook collections. 6 CDs, 7 hours 36 minutes."
4,Great help for clinical reports,This book is really helpful when learning to assess clients and write clinical reports. It was well worth the money.
5,"Great Condition, Quick Arrival",The item arrived in the condition promised and in just a few days. I was very pleased.
2,Where is the CD?,While the text portion of this book is acceptable there is NO CD that accompanies it. That one is told after buying the book is available by spending another $50.00 to get edition #6 which was just released this month. I wished I had known that before...would have saved the $$$ and bought #6.
4,What I expected,"As a Mental Health Professional, I had attended a seminar on the DSM-IV TR and had an opportunity to view this book before buying it through Amazon. Also as a Mental Health Professional, I work in Crisis Services and write many reports, often late at night. This book serves as a tool to come up with the appropriate terms for report writing especially when tired."
1,not worth purchasing,"i am a big fan of the peter green era mac. the souind quality of this cd is terrible. its to bad because the selections on this cd are terrific songs. stick with shine69 ,boston blues or boston tea party cds for excellent live mac of this period."
1,Too lo-fi (except for ultra-fans),"Let's go : Jeremy plays slide and sings ""Got to move"".Here are the Macs at the beginning of their saga.But the audio quality is terrible.Listen to ""Shrine"" , ""The complete Boston Tea Party"" or ""Fleetwood Mac in Chicago"" .Supernaturals."
1,Bait and switch,"After a field search for artist / title on CD, I am directed to a site selling me the title on LP. Expecting the search paramaters to still be in effect I purchased and LP I cannot use. ERROR... ERROR... ERROR...amazon programers beware! This is the second event happening... one more strike, and your out."
5,niffy machine,I've been using the hand-held device for years now; the new ones just aren't has quick and sturdy. I carry my NEC in my small backpack and take notes constantly thou out the day and night with easy access. I love my NEC the keyboard and i are friends and the screen is just right.
3,The Voice of Knowledge Cards,"They are ok. I have others I like better, but they may grow on me as I move along my journey...."
1,Junk water bottle for guinea pigs,"I liked that this was glass and not plastic but it didn't work. My guinea pigs were unable to drink from it. Not sure if it was because of the valve for the water. Luckily I read about leaving another functional water bottle while trying out a new one or my guinea pigs would have dehydrated. I'm stuck using a plastic one still which tends to mold. I was hoping I wouldn't have this trouble with a glass one, but guess I'll never know. Only good thing is Amazon's service was great and gave me my money back."
1,leaked,i got 2 of those bottles i liked the fact that it was made out of glass because piggies like to crew i was wrong i payed so much money and both of the bottles start leaking right after i start using them i hate it i have like 5 bottles not working in my house
2,Non-dripping danger,"I bought this at a pet store. I wish we had just waiting and purchased a bottle on amazon because we would have seen all these awful reviews. We had the same problem that many users had with no water dripping out. The dangerous part is that it drips at first, so even testing it after filling isn't a guarantee that you'll catch the problem. I read many reviews online looking for a solution to the no-drip problem, including testing it at various levels of fullness, but nothing worked. One review suggested removing an inner gray seal, but that nothing like that exists on my model so I really have no idea what they're talking about.The bottle is sturdily built and includes two types of attachments -- wire hanger and spring -- which is why I'm giving it 2 stars, but ultimately this bottle is a danger to your pets, so please buy something else."
1,Did not dispense water.,"I bought this water bottle for my two baby Degus. After I filled the bottle with water I attached it to the cage and then pretty much forgot about it until two days later when I set up a larger cage for my Degus. When I washed the bottle out, refilled it and attached it to the cage again my Degus began to fight over the water bottle. After watching the bottle work I realized that after the water was emptied out of the tube the air that took its place was not going into the bottle to let more water down into the tube. So I had to sit there for half an hour shaking the bottle every 30 seconds to keep the water flowing for my Degus. Needless to say That same day I went to the pet store and got another glass water bottle that works perfectly.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
1,noooo,"i think that my water bottle is not letting out any water because my chinchilla has been acting wierd and not eating. Now I am almost certain though, after reading the reviews from other people that bought them. trust me when i say DO NOT BUY THIS WATER BOTTLE! it sucks"
1,Defective Nozzle,The nozzle leaked all 1L of water into my chinchilla's cage overnight.... what a mess. I cannot recommend this product.
2,Design flaw (Updated opinion),"Purchased from local pet shop. No apparent problems until ratties began to drink from it. A steady stream of bubbles to the top creates a suction effect that joggles the bearings inside, leading to a constant dripping. Bottle empties itself in five minutes. Rubber washer could likely have solved problem.On the plus side, the design of the bottle is keen. Laying flush to the cage and held securely in place. A shame about the leaking, though."
1,Mine was bad..,"Leaked right out of the box. I assumed I was missing something, so I read the directions and confirmed that everything was in place as it should be. The leak was pretty bad. A steady drip. I definitely would not recommend."
1,the hell,"i just got it and when i opened the package there was glass all over the bottom of the box, i didn't even get to use it so i suggest you don't use this product."
2,I love it for a month but now . . .,"I loved this bottle when I first got it. It is glass, but very thick glass. In my experience thin plastic bottle break more easily. I could go on about the reasons I like it, but I won't waste your time. I've had it for a month, and now it has begun leaking. I don't mean a drip here and there. The whole bottle was empty in less that an hour. Waste of money. I wish I could get this bottle with a better valve."
1,High hopes... But worst bottle EVER!,"Liked the glass, high capacity, and little floating duck. However, this bottle has some serious flaws. First of all, it cannot be mounted on the outside of the cage or the nozzle won't reach inside. I mounted it inside and was hoping it would work, even though filling would be a bother with it mounted there. For those of you with ferrets, you know that sometimes you just want to let them sleep!Well the next morning, I hear them drinking, but it goes on for 15 minutes! Wow, someone was thirsty. Nope, the bottle was full and they were ferociously licking the nozzle. There was barely any water coming out. I put their old bottle back and they all rushed for it. This one is going back.Actually, there is a worse bottle. The one that has a little bar on the end instead of a ball. My fursnakes couldn't get it to work."
3,Mediocre release,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Kill! known as ""Kiru"" in Japan is the story of two samurai who is enter a poor town and become entangled in a feud between two rival clans. The film is based on Sanjuro but is not a good adaptation in my opinion.The Criterion DVD only has a theatrical trailer as a special feature which I think is not a good thing for a Criterion release. The DVD is available by itself or in a box set with the film ""Samurai Rebellion"", ""Sword of the Beast"", and ""Samurai Spy"". The box set is the better version to get."
3,spagetti western meets jidai geki,"Adapted from the same story as Sanjuro, Chanbara fans will delight in this black and white samurai flick by director Kihachi Okamoto. For those of you who love Yojimbo and Tatsuya Nakadai, you'll want to get this one. Great mixture of comedy and action."
2,Kinda funny set up. boring,This film has a hilarious love triangle set up. Like in the realm of the senses two or part of rashamon. The Japanese know how to rock some good humiliation. But ultimately the film is forgettable. Not a stand out samurai film by far.
1,Should have known better,"Could tell this is a cheaply made product when actually seeing it.I have gotten good deals at Amazon before, so I took a chance.This product did not work upon receipt. Thought maybe it was the battery, but a new one didn't help.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Designed for Cheap,"The objective of the designers was clearly to make something cheap. The toothbrush vibrates, using a small 1.5V motor that spins an eccentric weight. The vibration source is in the handle. The bristles are not moving, other than what happens by way of this vibration. The on/off switch is easy to operate, but my three children dependably forget to turn them off. In my opinion, this is a waste of money up front, and the product will eat batteries as children use them up quickly (forgettting to power off)"
1,Don't waste your money!,I was so disappointed with this product. It is supposed to be an electric toothbrush that actually moves when you turn it on.. but it was so slow I still had to manually move it to brush my teeth!
2,Cheaply built,Well I got this to pollinate my tomato plants and it was the cheapest powered toothbrush I could find. However this product is very poorly build and mine broke down after a few days. For $2 I can't complain and you cant go much wrong.
2,"Good broad strokes, light on details","I'm a web developer and bought this book hoping that it would--as advertised--teach me how to setup and install a working LAMP server. I found this book to read more like a checklist than anything. Install this, uncheck that. The book provided little insight as to the reasoning behind these decisions, nor did it provide any detail on how to fine tune or configure some of the more arcane components like email or ftp. It definitely did not teach you anything about how to live and operate in the Linux environment. These I had to figure out on my own. This book reads like a free website article repackaged and bound. Stay clear of this one."
1,a non-technical book for non-technical people,"50% of its contents can be found in a general Red Hat Linux book. Most other parts can be found in the web sites of Apache, Webmin and so on. This is the worst book I bought from Amazon.com, the first book from Sitepoint. I wouldn't buy a book from Sitepoint for a long time. I feel sorry for my company which paid for the book."
5,Satisfied!,"I liked your product, only wish it were ""adjustable"" as it causes me to have a headache if I wear it to long. (elastic band) I was under the impression that it was open in the back."
1,Came too late,"I ordered this book for a final paper and didn't receive it until after graduation, even though I had the shipping expedited."
1,Don't Buy!!!!!,This light is small and not worth your money the glass broke after the first 5 min of use buy something better than this.
1,brinkmann 800-1515-0,"I ORDERED 2 BRINKMANN 800-1515-0 STARFIRE II Under water fishing lights. When the box arrived I did not observe any damage but when I removed the 2 items which were packaged separately I OPENED ONE OF THE SEALED PACKAGES AND CAREFULLY REMOVED THE BRINKMANN LIGHT AND OBSERVED THAT THE GLOBE WAS CRACKED AND NOT USEABLE, THE OTHER ONE WAS FINE. I REPACKAGED THE DAMAGED LIGHT AS BEST I COULD AND FORWARDED AN EMAIL IN REFERENCE THE DAMAGE AND WAS ADVISED THAT IT WAS ALL I HAD TO DO. I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO LEARN WHAT TO DO BUT HAVE NOT HEARD WHAT TO DO ABOUT RETURNING THE BROKEN LIGHT."
1,broke first day,It worked very well hanging off the back of my boat at night while kids watched all the critters. I suspect the filament broke somehow but not sure. Glass is in tact but it just stopped working.
2,STARFIREEE,"broke within first hour of use, package was damaged when arrived also the lights are not as bright as the lights you get from Wal-Mart."
5,Seasons of Her Explores the Complexities of a Modern Woman,"The poetry of Tonya Marie Evans, collected in Seasons of Her, reflects the complexities of a woman who came of age in the 1990's. Sensual, spiritual, thoughtful, the work explores many of the ""selves"" that a woman encompasses. Tonya Marie is ferociously honest and fearlessly frank in her discussions -- the reader feels as though they have looked at the author's soul -- and found it is not so different from her own."
4,Wow!,"This poetry is so honest and open, and I admire Tonya Marie Evans for putting herself out for all of us to see and to admire."
2,typical biblical fiction,"I truly wish that the author hadn't carped quite so much about Zipporah being ""black skinned"". The Israelites were more interested in where she came from and what she was doing than her skin tone. Took alot away from what could have been a good book instead of just a fair book. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Disappointing,"I wanted to like this book... but it was disappointing. I liked Halter's book ""Sarah"" enough to get Zipporah, the second book of his women in the Bible trilogy. Zipporah was slow to start and then it descended into hopelessly corny. I'm putting aside that Halter plays fast and loose with historical sources here -- this is after all a novel. I'm basing this review primarily on the fact that the book isn't very good. The plot lacks depth. I thought Halter failed to portray the characters with compassion or interest. It's a hollow read that I forced myself to wade through only because I had paid the full hard cover price."
4,You don't have to be a Christian or Jew to enjoy this book...,"...but this novel with help you understand ancient Biblical figures if you are. I stumbled upon this book in a bookstore and read it in a day. This book is at once heart-breaking and inspiring, even though there are a few awkward passages on the part of the writer. None-the-less, I enjoyed this book thoroughly and will read the other Cannaan trilogy books."
2,disappointed,"I loved Halter's Book "" Sarah"" and immediately ordered Zipporah when I finished it. I was bored and practically forced myself to finish the book. Story line was weak and the characters were not defined well enought to like them. I will try another of Halter's books when available."
3,biblical disappointment,"Marek Halter's biblical fiction promises a lot, but the executions are disappointingly ingenuous, not rich in style or content, and in my opinion not very stimulating....a sort of quick read combination of fictionalized history and bodice-tearing romances. I think Zippie deserves better."
5,"Interesting for all, regardless of religious background",This is just a very good story - it is an easy read and something you wont want to put down. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read the entire thing in less than 2 days.
2,Nowhere near as good as SARAH...,"I was very excited to read this book when it came out, as I had read and thoroughly enjoyed Sarah...but I was severely disappointed. While as a novel it wasn't terrible, it veered so far from even the little bit we know about the wife of Moses that it mostly served to frustrate me. The whole story was basically made into a story of race, and I believe that Halter could have written an interesting novel about this woman without trying to make her tale more ""exciting""."
4,Was it Fiction?,"The story is FICTION, because women are only rarely mentioned in the Bible. Zipporah was mentioned, briefly... and this story fills in the blanks with great license. A pretty good read"
1,Not good at all,"After reading 'Sarah' I was expecting this to be just as good. I was EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED! Could this book have been written by the same author? Why are they so opposite in ""readability""? I would NOT recommed this book and I only hope the last one will make up for this one."
2,Disappointing,Historically innacurate and a slap in the face of true biblical scholarship. As the first reviewer stated.... if you want to know the story of Moses and Zipporah read the real thing... the Bible itself. This is a fictionalized story with the names Moses and Zipporah.. nothing to do with the real characters. I loved SARAH .... what happened here?
1,Awful,"I gave this book a chance, but it was a waste of time :-\We know that racism exists in the Bible,but there is too much emphasis on it in this book.What I 'really' want to know is..Where in the Bible does it say that Zipporah was adopted?I wish the author had spent more time on her background,that may have made the book a tad more enjoyable.I would have rated this book with O star, but there was no place for me to do so. :("
2,StreamSonic Gumstick Battery,I bought it for my Minidisk recorder that uses a NH-14WM. It doesn't hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. You get what you pay for.
1,No Bargain,I Ordered one of these some time back. Was able to charge it once. Now it will not recharge. Just be warned.
5,"Great product, very affordable replacement for my Panasonic HHF-AZ09","It is a battery, a good battery. I cannot write too much about it. :-)However, I want to highlight the great custumer service behind this product. Hitech assisted me in many different ways. Very good seller, very good customer service. Highly recommended."
3,Sadopaideia,I bought this just to see what kind of approach the author would take to this subject. It proved to be not too interesting.
2,Don't bother,"Considering how amazing some of his axe work with Dio is, this video strikes out. The licks aren't very interesting or usable, the techniques are really only good for beg./inter. players. I got it because I'm a huge fan of his playing, but it didn't represent all that well. If you're looking for good instruction, get something contemporary (Paul Gilbert, Rusty Cooley) or just go online. There are tons of great lessons for free online. Don't spend money on this!!"
2,bad condition,"the Disk is messed up, need to buy a new one. It skips around and all the other disks I play are fine so its the one disk only."
2,Not up to snuff,"I love Lorrie Moore, but this book just was not up to her usual standard. It was well written, but I have to say I did not find the characters very interesting. There was a lot of build up, so you thought something either really good or really bad would happen, but no such luck.Really kind of boring!"
5,Great book,Read this book . . . Lorrie Moore can say in one page what it took Curtis Sittenfeld 400 pages to try to say in her novel Prep.
3,Disconnected,"A lot of the reminisced portion of the book was very good. I liked the story that took place in the amusement park - but for me she failed to make a connection with the parts of the book that dealt with her present life - eating brains in Paris.Not a total failure, it was a quick read, after all, but the connections didn't come through for me.Bill"
1,pass the Tylenol,"This book gave me a headache. I am a huge fan of Moore's stories but I hated this book. Moore is great but this novel highlights her flaws: a tendency towards pretentiousness, lack of cohesivenss, and characters that are often hard to sympathize with. Skip this and read her short stories, they are awesome."
2,little too ubelievable,"This book was interesting in the fact that I couldn't put it down, but it was just a little too unbelievable. Everything fit just right and not to mention that I was suppose to feel a type of sympathy for this character. I didn't feel anything but that she brought it all on to herself. This book is good for someone in midlife..."
3,Pretentious and farfetched,"Am I really supposed to believe that two fifteen year olds were served alcohol on a regular basis at local taverns? That they regularly picked up older men and were never raped? Give me a break. All this poetic writing gives me a pain in the neck. Also the ""ugly duckling with beautiful friend"" scenerio is nothing new and done better elsewhere. Moore can write, but why does she write like this? Why not write so that the average intelligent reader understands and can relate to her characters?"
1,Not for a Book Group,"Reading this book for a book group, we were greatly disappointed. The plot lacked substance and little was told about the characters. The title of the book was worked into the theme as an afterthought. We wished we had chosen another book."
2,Entertaining but unoriginal,"This book is enjoyable for a casual read, but still leaves something to be desired. Moore certainly has a feel for language but too often defaulted to cliche in her characters. As a result, the points in the plot felt random and badly emotionally justified (by the characters). Frequently it seemed as if the author were making too much of an effort to be blunt and quirky for the sake of being blunt and quirky.For something with a bit more pith, I'd recommend Judy Blume's classic ""Summer Sisters""-- a beautiful and powerful book with a surprisingly similar storyline."
2,Not a very realistic hypothesis and approach,"Having read the book I found the autors concept that Intelligence is something that is ""learnt"" and not ""inherrent/innate"" incompatible with the traditional definition of intelligence. According to the autors hypothesis this means that a bushman in the African jungle must necessarily be of lower intelligence than a literate person of the new world. However the book certainly helps one to improve ones score on a typical IQ test (if this is a real measure of innate intelligence)."
5,Great Insight to an Insightful Maestro,"Joe Pass needs little introduction, any web search will bring up a plethora of history on this great guitarist. Solo, his work is unparalleled, trapeze artistry without the net. I'm really glad Wolf Marshall has worked up this insightful study into the styling of Joe Pass, it's a wonderful way to get into the music a bit deeper, to accomplish and perfect you own chops, to grow in your guitar vocabulary.I'm playing Bass mostly, but ANY insight to any instrument only adds to the ear, which translates to the hand. Thank you Joe Pass for your music, and kudos to Wolf Marshall for opening up the music for us."
1,Sorry a transcription specialist who doesn't play,"This is not a good book as it's ""anazlyzed"" but someone who transcribes, can play transcriptions but has no clue as to how Jazz is really formulated at all....rockers do not know how to teach jazz except to copy it and that's what this book is all about, guesses. Not a valid book."
4,Knew the author,"When I was a child in the 1950's, Carol Nay was my neighbor. She once loaned me a copy of this book which I thought was fantastic, both for the story and illustrations and because I knew the author. Carol and her mother owned a toy store in San Marino. All of this was very impressive to an 8-year old!"
3,Ok but not as good as Borne Identity,I thought it was ok but didn't move as fast as Borne Identity. Still I would recommend it to people. Looking forward to reading the third of the trilogy.
5,the legacy lives on!,"It is great to see this Bourne series getting all this attention, and I can't wait for the movie! Ludlum was the father of the modern thriller (at least in my opinion). this is the middle book of the Bourne Series about a deadly assassian created by the US goverenment, from the mild manner David Webb. While not as good as the ""Bourne Identity"" it is still a must read for all thriller fans, and hopefully a new generation of fans will get to enjoy this fine trilogy! Also check out ""The Bourne Identity and Ultimatum"""
3,The Bourne Supremacy,"The beginning of The Bourne Supremacy by Robert Ludlum starts off as an action-packed murder mystery in Southeast Asia. David Webb now has to rise again to defeat the assassin impersonating him. As I look back at the first book, The Bourne Identity, I feel that the sequel did not meet my expectations. For one, I think Ludlum wrote the Bourne Supremacy in order to write the last book, The Bourne Ultimatum, which already seems to be better than the last. For Carlos, the original threat to Bourne, wants Jason's head. However, I would still recommend this book because of Ludlum's action-packed writing style."
3,"Great plotting, weak writing.","When I first read The Bourne Identity, the first 150 pages or so were torturous, but once Bourne kidnapped Marie and the plot began to unfold I was hooked. The Bourne Supremacy, however, had me hooked after the second chapter (since the torture in this one only persisted through the first chapter). I have never read anything else of Ludlum's other than these two books but I have to give a tremendous amount of credit to his ability to map out the political and personal machinations of his different characters. His writing, however, could benefit significantly from a thesaurus (count the number of times he uses the word ""mollify"" - or ""mollified,"" ""mollifying,"" etc., for instance), and his dialogue is often atrocious. But, again, his ability to render subtle shifts in power dynamics (between groups, individuals, etc.) is riveting. So - it ain't literature folks, but it sure is damn fun."
3,"Good Plot, excessively long story","I bought the original Bourne trilogy intending to read all three books, especially since the reviews on the first two were very positive and that I wanted to complete the entire trilogy. The Bourne Identity was fantastic and I was looking forward to a similar story with the Supremacy but I was somewhat disappointed. Although the plot was fantastic, the execution was poor. The book became bogged down in excessively repetitive dialog and an excessive number of side story's or events. The book could have been much better executed had there been less detail. Although detail is important, Ludlum put too much into his book which was a shame. Until I reached about page 400 I was having trouble reading more than 10 to 20 pages at a time as I would begin to lose attention.I don't know if i will finish the series."
1,couldn't bring myself to finish it,"Life is too short to read books like this. The plot just moves constantly in an annoying series of shouting matches and no personality. Not to mention the Mandarin language used was questionable... both in its content and in the fact that people in Hong Kong and Kowloon primarily speak Cantonese, not Mandarin.I am sad to see that this book has so many positive reviews, but to each their own I guess."
4,Bourne,"A favorite read, I think it's the third copy purchased for the family library. An execellent way to spend a rainy day."
3,Last of it's kind,I think I have reached the end of the Bourne volumes here. Too Clancy-like and too impossible. Took too much effort to accept the robust and far flung concepts.
3,Bourne Again!,"The Bourne Supremacy is the second book in the Bourne trilogy of author Robert Ludlum. This time around Jason Bourne has been flung unwittingly into the politics of China and has to both reincarnate himself and battle his own reincarnation.The book is fast-paced, thrilling and certainly has enough action to satisfy the most ardent of espionage buffs. It, however, loses points once it begins to avail itself of one too many coincidences and lucky breaks. Sure, the reader is supposed to reason, this is fiction and fantasy, but a little more realism would probably have worked here.Nevertheless, The Bourne Supremacy is a fun and involved read for those who can suspend their disbelief and dive into the thick of the Far East quagmire."
2,Deviates from the storylines in the first book.,"This book was okay, but definitely not better than the first. This book deviates from the storyline(s) created in the first book. If you want to read the books out of order then you can definitely read #2 before reading #1 in the series. Though, you do have to read the first book to understand what's happening in the third. I hated seeing Bourne get older and slower and less capable of taking out enemies like he used to."
1,Laughable,"This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read. It is laughably hokey and unrealistic. There is even a scene where Jason gives a karate chop to the back of someone's neck and they fall unconscious....I mean really, I thought that only happened in Get Smart episodes or perhaps Charlie's Angels.I understand this is fiction but there needs to be some basis for reality...otherwise why not just have the characters fly around like Superman."
2,The Bourne bore.,"As luck would have it, I had nothing good to read one night, so I picked this one up from the stacks in my garage. Robert Ludlum is a story teller, not a writer. I finished it out of pride, not desire. It has a nice plot, but the writing is poor, disjointed and a lot of the story is implausible. For instance, Jason Bourne travels all over Hong Kong and into Chi Com with a briefcase full of money and no one catches on? Wouldn't the briefcase be in the way when he was doing all that fighting and stuff? Marie's escape and flight was interesting, and the described chaos of Hong Kong is believable.Do I want to read any other Ludlum books? Not unless I don't have to pay for them and I have nothing else to read. Evidently this book was a best seller for weeks and weeks. Must be an East Coast thing. In the west we recognize tripe when we see it."
4,Action Packed,"This book was not a let down. I would have expected that it might have been, because it was the second book in the series, but Bourne Supremacy didn't let me down. The characters are multidimenssional, even the supporting characters. And the character Jason Bourne, what can i say Ludlum did an excellent job in combining, part scholar part ""assasin"" . This is a great book to read, full of fast paced action. I enjoyed it."
2,Supremely mediocre,"As other reviews have been equally and accurately critical, I'll be brief:- The dialog is almost always silly.- The schizophrenic inner rantings of Bourne become tiresome after the third chapter.+ The action is fairly well scripted, if a little beyond belief.+ Ludlum manages to form a fairly intriguing premise for bringing Bourne back from the ""dead"".- Readers of his first book will likely be dissapointed by the follow-up but then who hasn't been (Indiana Jone & the Temple of Doom?).- Considering the genre, this book ranks among.....well it ranks among the genre, what can I say?There, you've been forwarned."
3,Not nearly as good as the first!,"What ever happens to Carlos? I could not enjoy the book after realizing the tale of Carlos would be left untold. The book has an almost lame, drawn out plot,and lacks the bite and surprises that made The Bourne Identity one of the best books I have ever read. I think Ludlum should have left good enough alone and not writen a sequel. It doesn't even seem like Jason Bourne is in this book because all the mysteries that made the first book great are solved and that aspect of a Jason Bourne story can never be replaced."
3,Good action - HORRIBLE dialogue,"Like the title says, the action is entertaining and made me lose sleep. Interesting plot too! However, his writing style is confusing to me as I find myself turning back pages and re-reading paragraphs at a time. Also, I often have to re-read dialogue from the beginning to figure out who is saying what. You'll see what I mean when you read this book. Additionally, the dialogue is unrealistic. Nobody I can imagine actually speaks like his characters.If you want an entertaining book and won't mind totally absurd dialogue, then read this book.By the way, the movie doesn't seem to follow the book except for maybe the conspiracy theory."
3,"Ehhh... Good Sequel I guess, but I will skip the next one.","I loved the first Bourne book and could not wait to start reading the second one. The reason that the first book was so interesting was that the main character did not really know who he was or why people were trying to kill him. The reader and the main character were on a discovery ride together that culminated in an exciting ending.In the second book, there are not any big surprises. The main character has a dark past that he does not want to relive... (Insert big bad government directive here) and he is forced to return to being the person he despises.I found it difficult to really believe that he fought who he was/is as much as he did. The talking to himself in his head was annoying after a while.I would think that this will make a good movie -- but the book was a bit of a let down after the excellence of the first."
2,Barely good,"While the first Bourne novel had a really interesting idea for a plot; that of a man who woke up and didn't know he was and attempted to find out among violence, this is a mere continuation of a story that didn't need one. Ludlum's writing is of a style I can't stand, I've learned. He uses lots of italics, lots of exclamation points, his characters' inner thoughts are beyond cliche, and attempts at romantic dialogue are laughable. But still, somehow, he grips pulp fiction espionage enough to make one want to finish his books. While I didn't hate this, I couldn't say I liked it. Mostly bad writing saved by some cool ideas and fun action (though neither as good as the first of the trilogy)."
5,Strap in!,"Whirlwind adventure story written brilliantly. Any fan of espionage, intrigue, or adventure stories will love this book. Remember, it's nothing like the movie!"
1,Some one goofed.,"This book was fine until I reached page 256. The next page in the book was page 56, the begiinning of chapter 5. Thirty some paged later the book skipped to page 313.Apparently this book was put together with errors. Apparently no one, the original producer, or seller, checked to accuracy of the books continuity."
2,One of the Few,"I may be the one guy out there that does not like his books. What makes me mad is that I have gone through about three of them because he gets some much good press. I find the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention. I also did not like the location, I thought it would be interesting but I started to think I was with Jim Jones. Maybe I just have a mental block with him and the movies will be better."
1,Brain-achingly bad Part 2,"What the hell was I thinking?!?I read The Bourne Identity and then forced my through this doubly turgid piece of horse manure.I cannot believe that once again, the movie (completely different to the book) managed to trump the book. How bad can this guy Ludlum be? A two bit hack with less talent than your average Mills and Boon writer (and that's an insult to Mills and Boon writers - they are nowhere near this bad).More of my life wasted reading this total rubbish ..."
2,Watch the movie but don't bother with the book.,"If you are reading this review then perhaps you have read The Bourne Identity and are now contemplating the sequel? Don't bother. Just like a movie sequel, this book was written for no other reason then to crank out something to please fans and hopefully make a quick buck on the coat tails of an initial success.The Bourne Identity was a fantastic read and held my interest from page one to page last. This book wanders, has a week plot, is hard to follow, is missing pieces of the story which I guess we are supposed to assume but which only make it confusing, and overall lacks the sophistication of the first novel.If you're a Ludlum junkie then you're going to read this book regardless, but if you're like me and first became aware of Jason Bourne after the movies came out and your simple looking for a fun, gripping spy novel, then please take my advice and skip this book."
2,The Bourne Identity movie fooled me BAD,"I was REALLY impressed by the movie ""The Bourne Identity"" and made the mistake of thinking the excellent story line was due to excellent writing by Ludlum. Apparently, this is one of the few examples of a movie that's better than the book. This sequel is WAY too complicated to make any sense at all, and it's easy to tell the original book was the same way - the movie had improved on the book by paring away all the excess story lines (Jason Bourne would have had to have lived about 6 life times to have had all the past history that's documented in this series, and he's not even an old man.) OK, I finished the book; it wasn't so bad that I was going to stop in the middle, but I'd suggest you don't get started on it to begin with."
5,Different from the movie,"I have just about finished the trilogy that this book is the second of. They are very different from the movies. In fact, it is as if the movies just had the same character names and were just inspired by the books but have a different story all together.The books are a little slower reading then some of the more current books in the genre but I like the change of pace."
4,Pretty good ... but I guess the first was better,"I read this a couple of months after reading ""... Identity"". It is good, but I believe the first had more surprises, bigger JOLTS in between....know what I mean? This one has a plot that seems too far-fetched, even for Ludlum [ :) ] .I'm looking forward to ""...Ultimatum"" though........... Jason Bourne (NOT Webb) is just too charismatic....."
5,Danger is Bourne!,"This book is an amazing sequel to the Bourne Identity. It is adventurous, action packed and amazing smart. Jason Bourne is the anti James bond, he gets out of situations with his mind not gadgets. The few gadgets that he does use are some common place that you really have to marvel at their use, one example is a letter opener, and plastic string. This book sets the standard for the guy in trouble, against the system thriller, check it out and appreciate a true master of the genre in Robert Ludlum, as you follow the master assasin, Jason Bourne."
2,The Bourne bore.,"Ludlum's writing leaves much to be desired. The Bourne Supremecy has a good plot and opportunities for good action sequences, but Ludlum fails time after time to carry them convincingly. Many things are also implausible: Jason Bourne carries hundreds of thousands of dollars, all in cash, in a briefcase with him all through the story. I would think it would get in the way while fighting all the time. I can't imagine how it remained on the top seller list for week after week. Must be an East Coast thing. Out west we recognize tripe easily."
4,Pretty Good,"I may not be an adult, but I find Robert Ludlum's books facinating....I must say that the Bourne Identity was very good and the trilogy was great all together. It is true, I must confess, that the last two books weren't as great as the first, but they are still interesting and full of suspense."
3,Campfire,"This product is not perfect. One of the fake logs was broken in shipment and could not be replaced as the vendor buys it from China, no extra logs included. However, it provides a cheerful area where people can gather. It takes a lot of propane. The tank connection hardware that is included should fit all 2 to 20 gal. propane tanks. We had to buy a special adapter to make it fit the small camping canister that lasts for an evening on low flame, or about 2 hours if we wanted it to really look like a campfire. It seems well made and should be durable."
3,Fulltimer,I wanted something for on a patio. It is only good for maybe two people to get up close. Does not give off much heat unless you are close.
3,Cute little fire ring.,Not much heat or light from this cute little fire ring but it goes anywhere and sets the mood while camping.
5,The Wife loves it. Easy to use,"The Wife wanted one of these cause we never seem to get a fire going outside the 5th wheel. Was not too sure how one of these was going to work but decided to give it a try. I like it! It's easy to set up, take down, and store. I use a little 5 lb tank (easy to carry around) with it and I set the flame to where you can just hear the hiss of the gas. Can get a few nights out the 5 lb tank and it's less than $3 to refill. You are not going to stay warm from this thing if its 30 degrees outside but will do OK when it's in the 60s. Works great for kids roasting marshmallows, not sure about hot dogs, but have not tried it yet. Showed it to my neighbors, they bought one too, Other neighbor is considering to as well. Construction seems fine to me, well built. Only complaint is one of the 3 snaps that hold it closed always seems to pop open."
4,Nice ambiance,We have used this little campfire on our patio. Great for having a few friends over and gives enough light from the fire and a little heat too. Would not warm you much on a really cold night but so nice not to have the smoke and sparks.
2,It's just o.k.,"Works O.K. Seems to be it could be better built, not very much heat, latches are flimsy, logs are fragile easy to get broken, should of been made with legs on bottom to keep it off of ground."
3,Campco little red campfire,This is alright for appearance but if your expecting a campfire it doesnt come close.If you turn it up high enough to get the effect you can here the propane flowing and it sounds like a gas grill.If you cannot have a fire at a campground it serves the purpose. My suggestion is to drink heavily and you wont notice the differance.
2,unhelpful,"I excepted to learn to do detail paintings of flowers, but this book failed to teach me anything different from any basic watercolor book. I was interested in learning how to create the tiny details, but there was no steps of pictures how to create those details that make the painting. The book will tell you how to paint the pictures but not show you how. Unless you know what they are talking about you will be lost. The history in the book is great but other than that it was not helpful."
4,My kids love it.,My son especially loves Fireman Sam so we have a few of the HIT favorites and he always wants to play Fireman Sam over and over. The episodes on this dvd are:Thomas & Friends: Thomas & The LighthouseBarney: SummerFifi and the Flowertots: Life's a BeachBob the Builder: Splasher's Two StopsFireman Sam: King of the JungleKipper: The Swimming PoolPlus a Bonus Episode featuring Roary the Racing Car: Roary Cleans Up His ActOverall a good dvd that my kids love to watch.
5,Now I know all about glass pipe blowing!,"I picked this DVD up hoping the learn a little about how glass pipes are made. I got exactly what I bargained for and more.The DVD is full of killer footage of flaming glass being worked by master glassblowers, while a narrator explains what's going on with the glass on the screen. Some seriously cool pipes being made, great music, and a cool chill out DVD with nice fireworks.I would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever marveled at the beauty of a glass pipe. It'll help you appreciate and understand your piece more."
4,"If you like the subject, you'll like the book.","I am probably not a fair judge of this book since I loved the class that I used it for, and find the subject simply fascinating. But even for those who are less interested, I think Anderson does a good job of covering concepts with just the right amount of detail. The more difficult ideas are explained multiple times, which can be tedious if you understand them the first time, but very helpful if you don't. The only real complaint I have is the number of typos, especially in figures and graphs."
3,"Very dry, like the desert","The main objective of the text is to advance an information processing approach to mind in conjunction with functional neuroscience. With that in mind, one shouldn't expect a historical treatment of the field in this text. Anderson is an excellent author, and he makes his points clear (if somewhat over-simplified). CP provides anyone interested in human learning and cognition, either from a strictly theoretical standpoint or a practical standpoint, an excellent resource for thinking about the nature and complexity of what we do when we think (in the broadest sense of the word). The chapter on problem solving is particularly interesting and will propel one to reconsider the significance of our descriptions of things that exist. See also ""functional fixedness"""
2,This is a franchise ad,"After I read a number of chapters, it was evident that many have had the American Dream stolen by the Banks and Corporations, but this is simply an advertiesement for anyone considering a franchise business. Go in business for yourself with the help of McDonalds, Wendy's, etc."
2,Pearl Pureheart meets Snidely Whiplash,"I'm a big fan of Victorian mysteries, but this one let me down. The author was supposedly the inspiration for writers such as Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, etc. That's like calling a cave painting the inspiration for the Mona Lisa. The story was clumsy, totally unrealistic, and melodramatic even by Victorian potboiler standards. I kept expecting Snidely Whiplash to appear, it was *that* hokey. I can't even attribute the book's silliness to age: it was published in 1880, a time when there were lots of good mystery writers around. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for it."
2,Pure Guitar Moods,"I was expecting mellow guitar rythm music. This music is more folk music. The CD's were ok, but not my kind of music."
2,An adequate text in complex analysis,"This was the text used by our class at the State Universityof New York at Buffalo for complex analysis. Most of usfound the text to be too highly condensed. In other words, we were dissatisfied with the time spent on explanations, especially for some of the subtleties that can arise. A fine selection for a reference text, but, somewhat unpleasant as a text for teaching oneself the subject. Admittedly, complex analysis is a difficult topic. The author (a famous mathematician) does very well, actually, in the space alloted. (text by Ahlfors is superior, though)"
2,Examples are poor and low readability,The book was used at UCLA recently and I found it not enjoyable to read at all. The examples were very poor and did not seem to relate to the topics covered. Not a book I would recommend.
3,very good,I'm a Mozart lover I bought this cd because I wanted to listen the symphonie k 279b. The performance is great but the recording could be better. The conductor and the orchestra are superb but the soloist in k 364 needed more feelings. I recomend this item if you want to feel the tenderdess of Mozart music.
3,"Works, but not very rugged.","I was very happy with this unit the first few days, and then in popped in half. It still works, but I had to tape it back together. (This was not from abuse; it's just simple plastic that snaps together and it's awkward enough getting it in and out of a microphone stand with a Shure mic that a bit of pressure was all it took.)Audio quality was okay, but I kept having problems with distortion, Going back to my M-Audio Ozone was much much nicer -- so it's probably the cheapness of the MicPlug. For the price, though, it's hard to beat and I'm glad I have it (if it had not snapped in two ;-)."
2,ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK,"Not what I expected. The quality is not that great! 10 MORE WORDS!!!!! 10 MORE WORDS!!!!! TEN MORE WORDS!!!!!Obsiously I do NOT like to be told what I have to do, i.e., 10 more words, etc. etc."
5,The best sailing book I've ever been given!,"Bernard Moitessier was one of the best sailors of his time, if not the best. This book is his viewpoint of the very first solo race around the globe- a race he didn't truly believe was a race, but a quest. The narrative is wonderful-at turns technical, emotional, spiritual-and even (as other reviewers note) what could be described as ""mystical."" The book was written from notes during the voyage, and it is easy to see-if not to feel, snug as we are in our chairs on dry land- the mental strain it put on him. The ending is the full realization of the quest; and Moitessier went deep inside himself, out on the deep blue sea. If you have even a vague interest in sailing and ships, read this book. If you love sailing passionatey, why haven't you read ""The Long Way"" yet??"
1,"Courageous, but not exciting.","This is the story of Bernard's (the author) circumnavigation of the world, solo and non-stop. Bernard's courage is very inspiring.What drives the author to such lengths is his desire to escape from the ills of modern civilization. The narrative is not very exciting as the it vacillates between sailing log and random musings about civilization which are not too insightful."
1,A hard book to finish,"Painfully and intensely boring. The entire book Bernard crosses back and forth the delicate line of sanity. It ends with a rambling against 'the Machine'(today it's called the Man, same thing)."
2,Literary DOLDRUMS and SHALLOW waters.,"Moitessier is a lousy writer. I read the Logical Route and was bored stiff. I bought this because I'm interested in taking up sailing and was intrigued why he gave up winning the race and sodded off to Tahiti instead. Unfortunately it's more of the same: dreary 'logical' daily accounts of boring sailing log details interspersed with equally dull, repetitive, shallow, wispy musings on nature. There's some soft rant against the 'machine' at the end. No depth. No passion. No excitement. No philosophy. No adventure. No LIFE.If this is what Zen posing, bearded frog cross legged sitting on deck contemplating your navel, waves and stars 16 hours a day does to you I think I'll pass."
4,Great account of struggle with the sea and soul.,"This book must be read in the context of the other two about the first ever single hand round the world race in the early sixties. Though Bernard isn't much of a writer,he is so consistently devoted to the sea--even when it's nasty back--and his struggle to find his place in the world that the account leaves you admiring this man's courage and single vision.Among ""cruisers""--i.e. those devoted to blue water sailing above all else--Bernard is known as the uncontested expert. He is famous for ""surfing"" his boat in heaver weather, a feat few sailers want to experience, much less purposefully seak out. The appendix is full of weathered tips on safe sailing."
1,Don't bother,"The premise of the book is: ""Don't bother, you'll never do it"", and I just can't buy that. Skip this one and read some John Searle instead. Or if you have to read some Colin McGinn, read ""Mindsight: Image, Dream, Meaning."" Skip the chapter on dreams."
2,Defeatist,"As far as pure philosophy goes, I would say Mcginn is competent. However, the days are coming to an end where pure philosophy has any legitimacy weighing in on such issues as consciousness and the brain. These are becoming issues to be dealt with by science (neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology) and not armchair philosophy. The mysterian approach that Mcginn adopts is defeatist at the outset. He doesn't even really try to make himself aware of all the work being done in neuro and cognitive science. He starts from first principles, like the philosopher's philosopher that he is. All in all this is good for those swayed by intuitive philosophical arguments but for those of you who actually care to know anything about consciousness, look elsewhere."
1,Consciousness In A Godless Universe,"It only takes very few words to sum up this book. This philosopher, (lover of knowledge), rules out the possibility of consciousness having anything to do with a God or Soul's. This is in your face throughout this book. Mr. McGinn notes on pg. 84, after ridiculing the miracles of Jesus Christ in the first paragraph, he states in paragraph two ""Perhaps, it would be best at this point if I lay my cards on the table: I do not believe in the supernatural in any form""...""I also admit that there is no theory comparable to Darwin's that can be wheeled out to provide the kind of explanation we are looking for"".If you have any belief in a higher consciousness, God or Soul's, this book is not for you, or me. One question I have is, how did the Christian Science Monitor come to write a positive review printed on the back of this Godless book?"
3,The author's assumptions about mind are questionable.,"The author seems to assume that mind or consciousness is a separate entity in the universe only related to matter in some mysterious, unknowable fashion. He declines to see consciousness rather as a function of sense and motor organs coordinated by a brain or nerve center. Armed with his belief or assumption, he attempts to refute most of the theories of mind by other thinkers, not convincingly, but with beautiful logical constructs."
5,W.I.T.C.H the revealing,"I LOVED this book,it`s my fav,I love how the girls always kick butt as guardians!! I think this is the best comic book for witch EVER,so I suggest you totally read this book!!"
2,Not good.....and I mean NOT GOOD AT ALL!!!!,"This is probaly the only bad graphic novel they had! It sux! I hate it!!! YOU might think this book is good.....BUT I DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!11 I would recomend this to Arianna Sellers....she hates Elyon. But just to wrap it up,I hate this book."
3,Dated hero but enjoyable,"I started off really liking Max and his dry sense of humor. But a little ways into the book he started pulling all sorts of macho BS. Then he acts like a jerk (reporting Sophia's friend as a way to stay close to Sophie with no thought to Sophia's friend). Then he starts acting stupid (grilling steaks, etc.). So I became discusted with him. But then towards the end I started liking him again and I really liked him at the end. Go figure.I wouldn't pay money for this book but I think its fine for getting from the library. I started working in the early 1980s and I can attest to the sexual discrimination that went on back then. In fact, I thought the B story line involving Sophia's friend was more interesting than the A story line. However, Sophia's solution of falsifying a resume was downright immoral. Note to readers - Do not try that in real life! It could get you into big trouble."
3,Re issue,Already had this under different cover combined with something else. I hate when this is done. It's very misleading. This was an ok book. Not one of her best.
3,"Humorous, he-man/cowboy and smart feminine knockout dragout","When I downloaded this audiobook onto my iphone, it went into the music section rather than the overdrive application and I couldn't figure out how to adjust the speed. The narrator's voice was extremely fast and quite annoying. I liked the usual humor and tension between the characters, but this book felt a little dated. Even the nerdy math wizard became a ""he man"" to win over the oddly defiant ""feminine"" heroine (more like hit her over the head with a stick and drag her back to the cave). I have to admit that it was funny to listen to the story and it was a super-fast read."
4,Class,"Class is like Watching Porky's and The Graduate,I think it's messed up what he did and the cross-dressing part as well as perhaps any overtones however subtle of richpeople and how miserable they are.The Acting is pretty good,not a fan Of Lowe,Andrew McCarthy(Less Than Zero)is in it,Not much a fan of Bisset or her character and I don't feel sorry for her.But I thought it was a good movie despite these flaws regarding Class and Morals."
2,Nothing special,"""Class"" is neither a distinguished nor memorable film. It's not terrible, but it is rather dull. In addition, the acting is fairly wooden and the story strains credibility (why would Bisset's character ever hook-up with McCarthy's?). What is interesting about the film is seeing so many actors at the dawn of their careers (McCarthy, Lowe, the Cusacks, Madsen, Siemaszko)."
3,"An Attractive Cast Gives Teen Movie Some ""Class""","Class is a teen movie that has a pretty good first half, thanks in part to a cast that includes Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Jacqueline Bisset, and John Cusack. Then, after Skip (Rob Lowe) discovers that his best friend and roommate Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) has been sleeping with his mother, the teen comedy becomes overly dramatic and kind of boring. Worth watching once, though."
4,good film,i really liked this film.it's a cleaver take on The Graduate.the cast works really well together.Jacqueline Bisset was solid in this film and Looked good as well.
4,I had NO IDEA,"WOW. I first heard one of these tracks on Pandora and I immediately came to the Amazon site to buy the CD. WHY, WHY, WHY are black radio stations not playing more of their songs? What a pity. These songs really get to the heart of worship and I appreciate their voices and annointing. I gave this a 4 out of 5 because I think that they have a very ""youthful"" sound, and I just prefer the heavier, full-bodied blend of more seasoned singers. I am really looking forward to watching this duo as their voices mature and they blow up the gospel scene."
3,THE MOST SLEPT ON GOSPEL ABLUM!,"CHARLES AND TAYLOR WILL TAKE GOSPEL INDUSTRY BY STORM IN THE YEARS TO COME! THE ARE THEE NEXT UPCOMING BEBE AND CECE WINANS. FOR THE YOUNG FOLK GET THIS ALBUM. IT IS HOT.THE TRACKS ARE SLAMMING.IT'S A MIXTURE OF GOSPEL MUSIC. PRAISE AND WORSHIP, A BIT OF R AND B AND THEY EVEN SPIT A VERSE ON ""LOVE AND KINDNESS!""TAYLOR EVENS SOUND LIKE BEYONE A BIT ON HER ON SOLO TRACK AND WHICH SHE WILL TAKE YOU THERE INTO THAT WORSHIP MODE ON ""HEART SOUL MIND!' THIS IS MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE. THE FIRST LADY OF THEE GREATEST CHURCH IN CHICAGO IS BUMPING THIS!"
3,"Great vitamin, awful taste.","I ordered these in orange because my doctor recommended that I start using a sublingual b complex. Sublingual means that you let the vitamin dissolve under your tongue rather than chewing or swallowing it and this is one of the fastest means of getting the vitamins into your blood stream.I had one tablet this morning after breakfast and I just had the second after dinner. The orange taste is faint, but most of all I taste vitamin. It's bitter. I know that the benefits far outweigh the taste, so I'm going to continue to use them and buy this brand in the future. I just hope that I get used to the taste."
4,A blast from the past,"I've found that a good number of ""old"" books, actually have excellent ideas for teaching what would be considered difficult subjects, and I think that I'm not alone in saying that writing, and more specifically composition, falls into this category.This is one of such books; the clarity in which the grammar points are presented, and backed by real exercices is in a way,quite refreshing.I'm a teacher and this subject in particular (composition)had been a thorn on my side, mainly because most of the ""modern"" books out there, focus on a grammar point,turning it into something dry and boring.This book turns a reading into something interesting and fun, even if some of them may be a little outdated. It would be great to have an updated version."
3,Styling Nice - Quality Disappointing for Price,"This is a very cute and practical picnic service set up. Love the vintage look and there are clasps and nooks for all the service wear while leaving room for the food.That said, I'm disappointed with the quality of some of the items. One of the wine goblets arrived with a chipped lip and both were battered looking even though they were in bubble wrap and enclosed in boxes! And, there's another reviewer's report that the plates tested positive for lead. The quality of the blanket is cheap as is the material used for the fabric napkins. The basket itself arrived in good shape - no issues with the wicker or clasps and buckles.While I think this is an adorable little set up it is seriously over priced for the quality of the overall setup and contents. I feel like $50 - $75, if that, is more appropriate."
1,I Don't Get It.............,"I found Hannah's stories uninteresting and very difficult to follow. His writing , moreover , seemed disjointed and strained. I had trouble finishing this rather short book--which is very unusual for me. I initially thought perhaps it is just me, but having read the reviews of Hannah's subsequent, Yonder Stands Your Orphan I see that other readers apparently share my view of Hannah's writing. Skip this one and read Larry Brown's outstanding Facing the Music instead."
4,An introduction to co-morbidity and smoking,This very timely look at hardcore smokers and the particular difficulties that they often face when attempting to stop smoking is addressed in this book. It raises the question or co-morbid conditions that most probably affect the outcome for smokers who are truly attempting to quit but don't succeed for reasons of unaddressed co-morbidity. Unfortunately very few health professionals are aware that smokers very often suffer from hidden or asymptomatic conditions. This book begins to touch on an emerging area of study that holds much promise for the dependant individual. Why 4 stars and not 5? There is a wealth of information available that was not touched upon in this book and although still at the benchside I believe that it is time for a paradigm shift with respect to smoking and dependency ( versus self-medication ). All in all it's a good place to start opening horizons.
3,Engaging,I missed the character Stella Bonasara but Sela Ward is a fine addition to the group and the NY scene is hotter than ever.
2,Quality of dvd transfer,"This set of discs came with scratches on each disc and something about the storage case wasn't right the product numer on the binder of the case was unreadable most episodes had pixelation in the backround I played these on a panasonic blu ray player on a three month old Samsung 60"" LED also tried on my Samsung blu ray and 55"" LED with the same results. I have a sneeky suspicion the discs were copied were archived, and the originals were packaged up and sold on Amazon as new. From now on I will purchase DVD's & Blu Rays the first week of release from Amazon exclusively and not from a second party!ThanksDennis"
5,Awesome season,This is one of the better seasons of CSI I'm hoping to be able to get the final season soon.
4,Casting deficiency: an Amazon. com`s purchase.,"This seventh season of CSI NY has maintained the general high quality of this TV series.However, I am not sure that the new casting has improved the series concerning the female co-protagonistof Gary Sinise. The casting experts had shown a marked weakness in their original selection of the previousfemale co-protagonist and now they have not excelled in their selection either, I am afraid. Excellentcasting is esential to the success of a series, as we all know, because a weak co-protagonist, like in this case,could damage the whole series. For this reason, I prefer to give a four-star rating to this Seventh Season."
5,nice,my husband loves csi ny so far he has enjoyed every episode. thanks for the product it was a nice Christmas gift.
5,It just keeps getting better and better!,"This is about the time a show should be getting repetitive and stale. But not CSI:NY! This season is SO good!!! jo Danville joins the team, and she is super cool. She's a tough former FBI agent, but she is a really sweet colleague and mom. The team only grows stronger, and the stories keep delivering. The overall theme of the season seemed to be how much they could hurt Mac, which made for a very sad, intense story!"
5,csi:ny,I am the biggest fan of csi:ny! I fell in love with all the characters the first time it cane on tv! I hope it will foerver get bigger and detter! Thanks so so much!!
4,CSI New York: a turning point,"Prior to buying this season, I read a comment stating this was a ""touchy-feely"" season. It was just about spot on. I did not know that Melina Kanakaredes (StellaBomasera) left the series/transfered to New Orleans. And after the final episode, it may be it for Gary Sinise (Mac Taylor). I do like the addition of Sela Ward as the ex-FBI agent, she brings a new dimension to the team, but the season lacked the punch of the other six. You might not see Carmine Giovinazzo(Danny Messner) who just got promoted. We will just have to see won't we.."
2,Ever hear of RED SKELTON & DON RICKLES?,"I will never purchase this collection 'cause my main man RED SKELTON wasa no-show 'cept for a couple brief clips with Lucy as an afterthought. Iwill say that PBS did feature him quite extensively in a release a fewyears back titled PIONEERS OF PRIMETIME. Most of the reveiwers hit theproblem here on the head- as I felt as well with PIONEERS- there reallyare too many names & too much material to include. Maybe another six volumes would do justice to THE TOPIC. What's presented is truly greatbut something's terribly wrong when you choose to totally ignoreINSULT COMEDY with the likes of Don Rickles & Jack E. Leonard. For metho, SKELTON WAS A GIANT & among his peers considered on another level!!!"
5,Its funny Goddamit,"Oy,this is some funny schtick,wheres Milton when you need him,but seriously folks this stuff is funnyyyyyyyyyyy.Billy should get an Oscar for this, well at least an emmy or maybe a cleo.Keep up the good vork."
1,Not waterproof at all,Not waterproof at all. The day I unpacked it we had a light rain (maybe for 10 minutes) and the it soaked right through. I would return it but it's not worth the hassle.
1,dust cover not more,Well i purchased this item to protect the bike from the sandstorms and some rain and it really doesn't protect from either of those elements. This is a dust cover for inside use only. Will invest a little more and get one that will at least protect from the rain .
2,Low quality print job,"This is a very poor quality edition of The Canterbury Tales. The pages look like they are photocopies of an old edition printed on cheap paper with warn type. I was so dissatisfied with this book, I purchased the ""The Canterbury Tales: (original-spelling edition) (Penguin Classics)"" and was very pleased."
5,Like new,"This made my Panasonic wet/dry shaver work like new. I considered buying an expensive Braun shaver with the cleaning cartridges, but I can get the same results by rinsing and drying the blades and then spraying some Shaver Saver lubricant/cleaner on them."
1,Wrong replacements for my Panasonic razon,I had purchase this as part of Amazon's recommendation when I purchased my Panasonic razor. Little did I know that it was the wrong part until I have to replace my blades (1 1/2 years later.) I wish Amazon would do cross-checks before placing products together!
2,DULL,"Like the other reviewers, I claim these things are pretty dull. I shaved with the original blades for years and figured I should replace them. Never had a fantastic shave since, even wet or with pre-shave. If I can't find decent blades I'll have to get rid of the Panasonic shaver that has served me pretty well over the years."
1,WES9070P Panasonic Shaver Blades for my ES8068,WES9070P Panasonic Shaver Blades for my ES8068I just bought these blades to replace the blades that have been in my Panasonic model ES8068 shaver since I've owned it for the past 8+ years... I wasn't having a problem with my shaver... I just assumed that after all these years... I should get new blades. I installed these new blades... and they were bad... like they were DULL... I had to go SLOW because it wasn't cutting my facial hairs fast enough... I ended up putting the old blades back in and I could shave fast again. SOMETHING is funny with these blades... They had to be dull or a different material than the ORIGINAL blades that came with my shaver.
1,Replacement cutter blades,"The name indicates the product is a Panasonic, it isn't. It appears to be a copy and isn't nearly as good. Next time I will spend the difference and get Panasonic replacement parts. Very disappointed."
5,I had good luck with these,"Though I was cautious after reading the ""these aren't anywhere near as good as the originals"" posting below, I went ahead and bought these as replacement parts for my beloved panasonic es8068. They work just fine, nice and sharp. Give it a try, and return if they don't work for you is my recommendation."
1,garbage,"I too, thought I was getting Panasonic replacement parts. The package I got had no manufacturer's name. Just a list of shavers these were good for on the back of package. The year old blades worked better than these supposedly new ones. (but alas, I threw them out when I got these). Avoid Goodmans at all cost."
1,A pointless purchase,"The blades I replaced were at least 8 years old. These cut no better and possibly worse, certainly not like I remember the original ones performing. There may be a secret way to insert the blades, but it's not obvious, and there were no installation instructions or any other documentation included whatsover.The blades do fit and they do cut. And that's all.Bummer."
2,Much to do about nothing.,I considered the book to be mostly a waste of time. Our book club chose it for its January selection. After everyone started reading the book we agreed to set it aside and pick another title for January.
2,"Boring text, nice photos","This book is an account of the author's railfan activities in and around Dixon and Rockford, Illinois, including working for short periods working for Electro-Motive and the railroad. But along the way, I got tired of reading about some of the geeky things he did. Tops among them was getting a one-night job as a baggageman on a passenger train that he had NO qualifications for, screwing up then getting chewed a new behind by a veteran conductor. He blames the conductor!He also makes armchair quarterback comments about how bad the Illinois Central-Gulf, Mobile and Ohio merger was. He bases that opinion on what? In hindsight it was correct, but Boyd didn't even have a college diploma to come close to making a judgement.If you do buy this book, buy it for the photos, which include some nice ones of IC passenger trains in northern Illinois taken in autumn, among others."
2,boring,"this book is very boring, if you are internet savvy then dont get this book because it is basically a learning tool for anyone who is not internet savvy."
4,Good information,"This book covers the different marketing strategies necessary to be successful on the Internet. It is well-written, easy to understand and gives some good examples of current Internet businesses."
2,Not impressed,"I had this inverter installed in my cargo van and just after a year it started giving me problems. I use it to mainly run an 800 watt microwave, laptop, and GPS. The inverter worked well then began to experience power loss. The unit remains on, but does does not give any continuous power output. Sometimes, the power output cycles on and off while still showing it is on at the switch. It is connected to a seperate high output battery of very good quality. I use it frequently, about 9 months out of the year. After 2 years now, I am still having problems with it. It is becoming frustrating not knowing if it will work or not. I haven't figured out any reason for it to act up. I am now looking for a new inverter. Maybe I just got a lemon. I expected more from a respectable name such as Tripp Lite."
1,No-go,Product never got voltage above 84 and burned out a ceiling fan . Was told by support that voltage was OK and that I need a true RMS volt meter to accurately measure it's voltage - guess the ceiling fan couldn't read the true voltage either
3,Great resource for teens,"A great resource for teens, but the pictures are a bit dated. An updated edition is in need. However, the information is still relevant and necessary for all teens."
1,Changing Bodies out of date,I was very disapointed with the book. Expanded third edition was deceiving because I thought it was new - my oversight. The book is out of date - I oversee a Center that teaches sex education and this was not helpful.
2,You Can't Use It At All Without the Audio Materials,"This is a great program. HOWEVER it does not come with the audiotapes or CDs and cannot be used at all without them, AND Amazon does not sell them or tell you where to get them. AND the CD set costs $48 from Cornell University, so this is one expensive textbook."
3,The Believability of 'The Changeling'.,"'The Changeling' is a play with an extremely complex structure- the plot seems to start off with the potential to develop it's dark themes but becomes preoccupied with the use of coup de theatre; such as the potion and the grisly deaths. Beatrice is shown in the first scene to understand innuendo and is able to respond in kind to Alsemero, but is later naive to De Flores' demands. THIS PLAY IS UNBELIEVABLE AND STUPID!"
3,BIG Disappointment!!,"We bought this for our son's 4th birthday. He is big into construction equipment and we were so excited to get this for him. He cannot pedal it around our yard. He gets so mad at it. The only way this toy gets used is if someone is willing to push him around on it. If you have a paved area for you child to use it, it would be fine, but we do not. Also, it's recommended for kids ages 2-6. My husband had to drill out another hole to put the seat back far enough for my son to fit it. His friends who are ages 4-5 cannot use it at all because they are too big. And one more thing...good luck finding the trailer to go with it. We bought one with it that was suggested by amazon. It was metal and very heavy, but the tractor is plastic. We tried to exchange it for the one we keep seeing in pictures all over the internet, but were not able to get it. If we could do over we'd get the power wheels version."
1,Waste if MONEY!!,"I bought this tractor for my son. I had to call the first day I got it because I put the batteries in the part that makes engine sounds and turn signal sounds and it began to smoke and smell. They quickly sent me out a replacement that worked. About 2 weeks later we began having trouble with wiring issues in the tractor. After many calls and complaints they sent me a new battery (but the wrong kind). Once I received the correct new battery it still didn't work. The faulty wiring was not with the battery but with the tractor itself as I tried to tell them, but they would not do anything about it. I've never spent $200 on a child's toy and never will ago from Peg Perago. This was a huge waste of money!!!! Now it just sits and takes up yard space.Also, even with a new battery it would not pull the weight of my 3 yr old (about 32 lbs)and would only pull the weight of my 1 yr old. I believe it says for ages 3-6.DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,love this tractor,Great size and durable! Fairly easy to install and seems to work well so far (only 1 month). The only thing I would change is the tires...they are hard plastic and I wish they were more like real rubber tires. Other than that we love it!
1,"Fun, but not durable","My 3 year old son received this for a gift from grandparents. As far as the fun value, its a blast. Assembly was incredibly difficult, however, and it has not proved to be very durable. The steering mechanism was the first to go. Then the pedaling mechanism went. 95% of the product is flimsy plastic - not as durable even as Little Tykes or Step2. For the price and the name, I would expect better quality. Any time you're making a riding toy for boys, screwing into plastic is not going to be a very durable option."
5,My son loves it but world's worst directions,"My son loves his tractor, but these are the world's worst directions. An example of one direction:""Insert retainer into special device."" That left me scratching my head - what's a retainer? what's a special device?"" As commenters have stated, there is just a list of part numbers. And the screws - you have to read all the directions and decide ahead of time what step takes what size since the directions don't specify.My suggestion for the steering wheel: Mine had small burr on the column so everytime I lowered the steering wheel it hit that burr, and clunk, the column fell inside. There is a small hole on the underside of the tractor which if you have small fingers you can insert your finger and find the other end of the steering column and hold it while you (or someone else) lowers the steering wheel.But as I said, my 2 year old loves it. He keeps wanting to take it to the park, I think he has visions of landscaping the sand area."
5,Sturdy tractor,"Purchased this for my youngest grandson, who is head over heels in love with it. A very nice unit built really well for the money."
1,Unreasonable Shipping Charge,"We're so looking forward to purchase this bed for our 2 year old son. But we're not going to get it because its shipping charge is just too expensive, $165. It's almost the same price as the bed itself. We're are not going to buy the bed unless they have it available in store or lower their shipping charge. For a $365 (bed + shipping), I rather get a wood twin size bed that is useful for life time instead of this toddler bed."
4,Racy Bed,I really like this bed for my son and he loves it. The one flaw is the room left on the sides of bed when using the crib mattress. My son (a two year old)ends up sleeping in the pit surrounding his crib mattress. He rolls off into the sides during the night. He does no hurt himself nor does he wake up. I suppose I will go ahead and purchase a twin mattress. Otherwise this bed is great!!!
4,A good start,This book is a good start for people wanting to launch a basket service. It gives the reader tips and warnings from people who are already in this business. I like the format.
4,Start Your Own Gift Basket Service,"This book covers all the basics of what you need to know to start your own gift basket service. It gives you ideas of what to offer and how to market your business. If you are considering a home business, like to be creative and have thought about the gift basket business, this book is a good start."
2,"Great ""coffe table"" book","As many of the other reviewers have stated, the book is beautiful, the author's art can even be inspiring, but if you're looking for helpful instruction, please look elsewhere.The book is loaded with Mr. Hammond's lovely works. However, as I read (and wanted to study) the book, I was severely disappointed by the lack of ""meat."" There are opportunities with each of his works for Mr. Hammond to share his ""nuts and bolts"" working knowledge of how he accomplished what he accomplished in each painting. Instead, he gives vague text, that if one has read many books on painting instruction, this same text can be found in the ""Introduction"" of most painting books.I truly looked forward to receiving this book and wanted to learn more about the workings and techniques for producing light in my painting. The one thing I did learn however, is that in the future I will be wary of books produced by this publisher as ""instructive."""
4,Very well presented,"I was delighted to look over the book. It is well written, beautifully illustrated, clear to use. It ranks very highly in my estimation."
3,Donna,My son is in a wheelchair and he needs extra seat support. This product is good for a regular chair but is too high for a wheelchair. My son sits too high up and also the center leg strap cannot work because the cushion goes too far forward as well. Good cushion but not for a wheelchair.
5,This pillow has worked well for my family member.,"I bought this for my grandmother who was always looking uncomfortable and squirming all around in her wheelchair. She has Alzheimer's so she can't tell me reliably how good it feels but she is not squirming as much and seems more comfortable.For all families buying a wheelchair, I recommend purchasing a gel filled or gel foam filled cushion for the chair is much time will be spent in the chair. Besides being more comfortable, it also helps prevent bed sores which is so important to avoid!"
4,Rodney is one of the greats!,"This is a movie that I had been waiting for...and the wait was well worth it. In addition to being one of the funniest movies ever made, it has also aged very well. If you loved it almost 20 years ago, you'll still love it today. It just gets funnier with every viewing! Rodney and Pesci are without a doubt one of the most dynamic comedy pairings ever! I gave this DVD 4 stars because the Spanish audio track is far superior(cleaner), to the English audio track...why?This movie will make you feel good...buy it!"
5,real life gut buster,"this movie has to be in the top ten funniest of all time. i mean how can you not laugh at a man who is in the bathroom looking for a ""roach holder"" and finds his daughter's eyelash curler and then quip as only HE can, ""This is da best ting bout havin daughtas!"", or how bout when he is on the diet, ""I cant eat all my home fries, , ya want some home fries?"" all the while he is staring at a pill. whenver i am down, this movie lifts me up. what a great movie!"
3,NEEDS A DELUXE TREATMENT! CLASSIC COMEDY,This a on of those films that is so much funnier than it should be! Rodney Dangerfield and Joe Pesci are great together in this blue collar comedy. I can't even begin to think of how many lines I've quoted from this movie. The 3 star rating is for the low rent DVD treatment. This film is one of my favorite comedies and really deserves an upgrade! Still a must own film for me!
4,there has to be an easier way,"another great movie from rodney danderfield,and add joe pesci.well that's a formular for comedy.who would make a bet to give up all his vices for a year.all i can say is,see this movie to find out the sad details."
3,"""Is this a knick or a knack??""","what a movie. Not only is it one of Joe Pesci's first movies, but it showcases all of Rodneys talents. Only he can turn a B-movie into an ""A"""
3,I Wish Money Really Was Easy,"Easy Money is a comedy that is only fitfully funny. But thanks to Rodney Dangerfield's usual comic energy, the movie is still worth seeing."
1,"So, ya don't need to write if a bigname's on the cover","The writing is poor, the character development is almost nil, and Kipling doesn't need to be forced on anyone, especially in lieue of decent storytelling."
4,A good start to a new series,"I have enjoyed Weber's and Ringo's previous work and found this to be a nice jaunt in familiar territory. We follow Prince Roger as he is shipped off on a social function for his mother but ends up crashlanding on a planet where not all the natives are friendly. We follow the trials and tribulations of the troops as the try to protect the fop, Roger, from himself and the natives as they travel to the spaceport around the world. It is just the first in what is purported to be a very long series, at least from what Ringo has said on some of the newsgroups.All in all, a well paced scifi military story. The writing is definitely a blend of Ringo and Weber with well drawn out battle scenes and interesting characters though they haven't been fleshed out as well as they could have been. I guess that is why there are several more books on the way."
4,Some of Ringo's finest work,"This was my first introduction to John Ringo's work and I admit I had avoided picking up the novel for a long time. But once I started reading I couldn't put it down, except to rush out and buy the other novels in the series. Weber and Ringo are the best combo going in Military Sci-Fi today."
4,Very good entertainment,"This novel by Weber and Ringo (I am not sure who the primary author was, if any), while having a fairly predictable backstory (spoiled brat prince becomes responsible man over time in face of adversity), is a very well-written book with some original plot events and an excellent way to kill 6+ hours (600 page book).I really don't have any complaints, though I did find the fact the aliens who had the party captive did not decide to simply take the casualties to capture their weapons, and that the party leadership was allowed, armed, in the presence of the king during the battle.Much of the battle sequences reads like Ringo's posleen series, with hordes of enemies being killed by a numerically inferior force.This is an enjoyable book - well worth reading."
3,A march in need of a finish,Enjoyed the novel but was keenly disappointed that it will be continued in a sequal. Would have much preferred that the authors complete the story in a single volume.
1,Cliche,"This book was the biggest train wreck, AWFUL. The only reason I finished it was to perhaps save someone else my fate. Some decent concepts, but the characters and events around their development were cliche and predictable, other events lacked motive."
4,"Well paced, nice mix of action/characters/humor","This was a good book. Not up there with the greats or anything, but a very enjoyable read.March Upcountry has a good mix of character development, action, humor (not silly), and a good story line. It kept me hooked. I recommend it, and am just starting the second in the series ""March to the Sea."""
4,March Up Country,This is a very good Ground-pounder-in-space yarn. As soon as I read it I wanted to get my hand s on the sequl.
3,"Lets go ""Upcountry""","What should turn out to be a fine space opera as it unfolds, gets my three stars. I hold two back because, although they are essential for the overall plot Weber and Ringo are developing, two of their devices make me cringe.Starting off with the unlikely rescue of a shaman who gives up everything for his asi helps the story but makes my asi ache.Second, the inability to manufacture anything that provides a tactical advantage beyond the ammo/power limited weapons or eliminates the drop dead escape date bothers me. These are MARINES.Having vented, I just ordered the second installment which I hope to enjoy as much as the first.I recommend this book to all space opera addicts."
4,Packed with great stuff,"This book features over 600 non-tournament games of the famed world champion. These games come from a variety of sources, including simultaneous displays, exhibitions, blindfold play, exhibition games, blitz events, and correspondence games. The games are very instructive and over a hundred of them have annotations. This book includes a lot more, including rare photos."
1,Buyer Beware!! Watch out for this company!!!,"I paid for a full year subscription to this magazine (6 issues) and I have only received 2 and the next issue is supposed to complete my subscription. Didn't get the first issue so I called, they couldn't find subscription, then found it and sent one magazine. Then I didn't receive the next 2 so I called again and they argued with me; have a very rude staff, blamed it on the post office, but lo and behold 3 days later I get the next due issue (1.5 months early). They told me I would not receive the magazines that were missing. I wrote the editor and never received a reply. This is a family owned business and they stick together and do not take care of their customers, AT ALL. Very BAD company to do business with. You are much better off with Mother Earth News or something of that sort. Stay away from this companyl"
4,A great toy!,"The Lego fire station is a great toy, very age appropriate, as well as fun and educational. I sat with my son and was able to assist him while he built the entire thing by himself. He is six, and the age on it was 5+. A great Lego set. Comes with a lot of men and little gadgets."
1,NOT a new ink cartridge!,"From the product description and the picture of the cartrigde I believed I would be getting new ink cartridges that were just a generic brand. When they arrived I found that they are basically someone's used cartridges that have been refilled with ink and relabled (the lable on the box and on the side of the cartridge clearly marks them as a ""remanufactured inkjet cartridge"" which looks completely different from that on the label shown in the picture)."
1,Ferguson: An Essay on the History of Civil Society,I had to purchase this material for a class which was extremely boring but somewhat thought provoking in the end it wasn't worth the money or the class time so much more could've come out of the this piece. I would rather sell this book back to amazon.com if I can
1,Do not buy this controller. I can't believe they are still selling this.,"I have purchased 11 of these controllers and only 3 worked. The rest did not work out of the box. The ones that worked wore out way too fast. The reason I keep trying is I really need one to play final fantasy xi. It is so much easier to play with one of these controllers. However they have buttons that are stuck on or that wont respond when I get them. I have contacted logitech and they have given me no support. There are no new ones. Any one you buy even if new in the box, has sat on a shelf for a long time. I believe this is why they dont work. I have had many many playstation controllers that work fine and take a lot more abuse than these netplay. They never have a stuck dpad or a stuck button.It is very annoying that no one makes these controllers anymore.Don't buy this. It's been sitting in some warehouse for years by now."
3,Bad Quality Control - Good Concept,I recently purchased this keyboard/controller combo and am already on the second. The first had the stuck 'O' button problem right out the box. Took it back and exchanged it for another and it too had the stuck 'O' button. I decided that at the price I paid and the fact that I like the keyboard part that I would keep it. I removed the 20 screws on the rear of the controller and popped the 'O' button back in place. Now it works fine. The analog sticks are very slippery to the thumbs - there are no rubber material to supply grip like on the normal PS2 controller. This is a nuisance and so I don't use the controller.I would recommend that if you're looking for a decent keyboard and you find this one on sale - get it. Just look at the controller as a bonus item.
2,They're nice. . . while they're functional. . .,"I am an avid player of Final Fantasy XI, and this keyboard/controller is a very convenient tool. The keyboard works quite well, the controller part on the other hand. . .I have had to replace three of these for the same reason; the analog sticks shut themselves off somehow, then you have to go and unplug and replug the controller cord in to fix the problem. This can be very bad when auto-running in Valkurm Dunes or any other dangerous area. >.>; That, and sometimes the analog sticks make you turn around and walk backward for no apparent reason, and it's hard to stop. I don't know how this happens to every one of my controllers, I am very gentle with them! >.< I like these while the controller is working properly, but I do not like being forced to replace them every 6-8 months for the same irritating problems. . ."
2,"Good idea, bad Quality Control","Like some others here, I'm also on my second Netplay keyboard return that's about to go back with a stuck ""O"" button. I called Logitech customer support about this issue, and stated they had no reports of anyone else with similar issues. Doesn't sound too promising, so I will probably end up getting my money back. Too bad, as it is a good idea, too - if only the quality control matched the idea."
1,not worth it,"This is my second purchase of one of these controllers.. my first one worked fine for the most part.. the keyboard had to be replaced but it wasn't a big deal. I just got a new one for my 2nd PS2 and straight out of the box the controller doesn't work. Somehow it seems to be internally stuck in the left direction.. and I have no idea how to calibrate it. So I'm just using my keyboard and basic controller.. irritating, but it works."
4,Received Replacement/Works Great,"I got a brand new replacement (...)P>It seems the keyboard was out of warranty already, even though I got it new from another retailer (whom I won't buy from again.) Perhaps there was a bad batch of these?Anyhow, the keyboard is great, and one doesn't have to switch keyboard and controller anymore. It's contoured nicely to sit on one's lap.My only complaint is that some of the keys could be bigger. Like the tab key, and all the punctuation keys around the return button."
3,Awsome If you get a working one,"This keyboard/controller combo works awsome if you can get one that actually works right. I have used these for years but have probably returned about 10 of them. They come defective, keys often type backwards and the controller buttons come stuck."
3,"Just because it's ""rare"" doesn't mean you want it","The original vinyl pressing of this album is supposedly one of the rarest surf albums of all time. If you happen to come across it at a garage sale, buy it! It's worth hundreds of dollars as a collectible.Now they've taken the original master tapes out of the vault and released this album on CD. Skip it. While the musicians seem to know what they're doing from a technical point of view - the actual playing is almost flawless - this album just doesn't have any character. It's dull and boring. Just turning the reverb up on the guitar doesn't make it surf. Good surf guitar makes you feel like grabbing a board and running out into the water, even if you've never surfed in your life and you live in Iowa. This album doesn't do that.The best thing this reviewer can say about ""Real Cool Hits"" is that the quality of the recording is excellent for 60s surf. Too bad there's no reason to listen to it."
4,Review of Story...Roll Tide/War Eagle,This is a great story about the rivarly between Alabama and Auburn. Either fan will enjoy each moment described by past players and coaches with a greater understanding of the intense rivarly. It also sheds some light on how a dedicated fan can go to far. Updyke should be arrested and placed in prison for a very long time! Also how a rivarly can be forgetton for a moment when tradegy strikes with the devasting tornado in Birmingham. The Auburn family went to Tucaloosa to help those families in need but still the rivarly remains.......
2,Does Not Measure Up,"This vid is poor compared to the rest of 30 for 30. Seriously, who really cares about a bunch of hillbillies knocking themselves senseless? It's what they do."
5,A Dessert Lover's Bible,"In his newest book, The Dessert Bible, Christopher Kimball has given us much more than a collection of mouthwatering recipes. He has provided the reader with an all-encompassing source of information about the best way to create desserts. I always feel confident that my baking will come out right the first time because Kimball has done all the testing for me. He doesn't only tell you how to do it, he tells you how not to do it. The book is cleverly organized into easy to understand dessert categories, with useful hints throughout. The result is that one ends up with a real understanding of the baking process. It is this no-nonsense approach that makes The Dessert Bible a must for the inexperienced and serious baker."
5,Baking at its best,"If you are familar with Cooking Illustrated you know the name Christopher Kimball. This book is a wonderful educational guide in baking. He investigates each recipe and variations on it completely. Before the actually recipe he suggests proper baking equipment, food ingredients, and where you can obtain all of these products. This book contains a wide variety of recipes for cookies, cakes, pies, puddings, and so much more. I like this book because it carries with it a nice cross section of all types of desserts rather than being just a book that specializes in pies, or cakes. The recipes are excellent, and it makes a nice read as well."
1,Recipes sound great - too bad they don't work,"I bought this book last fall and finally threw it away in frustration. The recipes simply don't work. I've spent hour after hour on these (often curiously complicated) recipes, only to throw out batch after batch. As an accomplished home baker, I haven't had results this consistently bad since I was a kid learning to bake. It's too bad, too, since these recipes sound so great on paper..."
2,Heroes Don't Run,"I think the author did a really good job describing the battle scene, by using details like blood and the pale faces of dead people. I could really imagine a war scene. I would recommend this book to people who like war and action books and would like to know more about World War 2"
4,A Great Book,"If you like books about war or boot camp then Heroes Don't Runs by Harry Mazer is the book for you.This book takes place in Bakers Field, California, 1944, Okinawa, Japan, 1945, and Pearl Harbor. Adam is going to Pearl Harbor to avenge his father's death, but his mom won't let him go because the family has made too many sacrifices in the war. Grandpa lost his arm, and his dad was killed. Will Adam go to war? Does he sacrifice his life? Will he be in trouble for not telling his mom he's going to war?We recommend this book to all our friends because its lets you see the kids point of view. We give the book four stars.By: Samuel and Miguel"
3,nice book,"I had to read this book for school, and I looked at it read the back and thought ""oh my god I am never going to get through this"",but the more I read the more involved I got. I can normaly tell how the book will end afer the first 50 pages but this one kept me guessing right up to the end. As an after thought if you like the show ""survivors"" I read somewhere that this is where they got the idea."
1,Misleading information!,"Purchased this item for the MC-CG467 Panasonic canister, as listed in the item description.However, this filter does not fit, not even close.Just a fair warning for others looking for the mesh filter for the MC-CG467 canister vacuums."
2,Only for serious vintage collectors,"This book, in my opinion, is only for serious collectors of vintage paperback books. I sell paperbacks and get my books at libraries, thrift stores, and book swaps. I have never seen any books like these. They are so unusual in appearance that one would immediately know that this book is unique. I would buy it knowing that it is worth some money. Only then would I need such a book as Collectable Paperback books. This book is definitely not for the usual paperback sellers.Regina"
3,Decent Video,"This is a movie short, and the film is pretty grainy and not very good quality. However if you are an avid Mickey Rourke fan, this is a good classic for your collection."
2,Broken 3rd string,"I put these strings on and played the quitar for a total of maybe 30 minutes over a weeks time, and after dropping the G string to an F# then back to G standard tuning, the string broke. I usually end up replacing my strings when the 1st string breaks, because i do often drop it down to D with an open D tuning, but that's after many many times and I kind of expect it. Not the 3rd string! This is the second set of Elixir strings that I've tried, and ordered two new sets because I'd had good luck with the first, liked the way they sounded and would say that they lasted at least three times longer than most. Disapointed in this case though."
2,wont' stay in tune,"I bought sets for both my Gibson 6 string and my Martin 12 string acoustic guitars. I am a novice player, mostly strumming for song leading on long weekends. I paid extra to get strings that I thought would last longer (as the product said it would). I put them on my guitar a month before the weekend I would play (as I have always done with my Martin lights) so they would be stretched out and ready to play. When I got to my weekend of leading music, I could NOT keep the 12 string tuned! I got half-way through the first song in my set and I was already out. Forget the capo. Each time I used the capo it was a disaster. the capo somehow sent the small G string into orbit and threw the entire tuning out. Once I had to put the 12 string down in the middle of a set and grab someone else's guitar to finish out the set. Can't wait to get my Martin Lights back on my guitar. Never again!"
2,Just ok,Nice sounding strings but they didn't last. Elixir advertises that these strings last 3 to 5 times longer than other strings. They don't! Save yourself some money and buy D'addario strings at a fraction of the cost.
5,Great sound,"These coated strings have a good sound thats bright enough yet not too bright. If you dont already know about elixir, these strings will last 2x as much as ordinary ones."
5,"the best strings, at a great price","I live in Israel, where these strings cost 3 times what the cost in America on Amazon. I had a friend bring them from back home, great strings, great price. I'd do business again."
5,Brilliant,They came in in perfect condition and there isn't much more to say than that I am satisfied and happy with the purchase
3,meh....,"I replaced my stock fender strings with these, and they definitely hurt my fingers more. I am a beginner, so I don't do that much sliding back and forth. I imagine these coated strings would be better for that type of stuff."
2,"love elixir, sound great.. but..","I love elixir! I absolutly love the sound of these, but they break on me after two sundays of playing. they sound great! if you like to strum lightly or finger pick you'll love them! if you are a slightly aggressive strummer like me you'll break them."
1,Poor Quality,"Had to have the strings replaced at a local music shop. The guitar needed some bridge work, and the strings snaped"
2,Too bright and overpowering treble.,"I just bought the Elixir from amazon and installed into my martin HD-28 guitar.My Elixir first E string was broken in the first week of use. And the treble is too bright and overpower the bass.If you like warm sound, don't try Elixir."
5,best strings ever,"Elixir makes the best strings for both electric and acoustic guitars,they really do have the sound and reliable then most of the other brandscoming from an armature guitarist who sometimes break strings tuning his guitar that saying allot."
