5,This guitar rocks!!,"This guitar is a great product! the quality of it is amazing. i have been playing guitar for 3 years and my little sister boought this first act guitar no too long ago. i picked it up and started playing with it and was amazed by it sound quality. its actually a great guitar for any one to play, whether they are a begginer or experienced. it is very light and portable, if u want something to mess around with when ur traveling. this is a really great guitar. every one who plays should get one."
4,Great addition,"I initially bought this to use as shade as I watch outdoor softball games (Im planning to attach it to my chair or cooler); I'll be using this in the future for my son's radio flyer wagon.The package states 26"" diameter coverage. It's pretty small for an adult, but doable. Looks cute for kids.The clamp is about 5"", then followed by 4"" of flex, then 20"" of the umbrella's pole.The 4 inches of ""flex"" to adjust where you want the shade (big plus for me).It doesn't fold by much, I'd guess about an angle of 30 degrees. So don't expect to clamp it horizontally (well, it IS possible, but not sure if you'll be getting any shade.The clamp feels very sturdy and strong, it may take 2 hands to open the clamp."
1,Umbrella,"The clip on the umbrella is cheap,broke as soon as we clipped it on the wagon. The umbrella itself was fine,it was just the clip was cheap plastic. Would no recommend this product with this kind of clip."
3,A little disappointing...,The umbrella just isn't as durable as I expected :/ kind of flimsy and feels cheap for having spent almost $20 on it. Although I'm sure it will do just fine for what I purchased it for. (to attach to the pack and play so my daughter can be outside)
2,Don't bother!,"I had high hopes for this umbrella, but it utterly disappointed me. After using it approximately 3 times, the pole is about to break in half where the little button is that extends the umbrella part. The pole is just not strong enough and will surely end up breaking in half. The spring is not very malleable, either."
1,Don't buy for a plastic wagon,The clamp on this broke the FIRST time I attempted to put it on my Discoverywagon. I assume the spring and clamp are not meant to open that wide.It is a strong clamp & should be suited to a metal or wooden sided wagon.
3,Great Concept but Not Durable,The umbrella is a great idea and works well with the radio flyer wagon. The problem is ours broke after limited use. The umbrella did not bend easily in the coil area. We found that when people adjusted the umbrella they always bent it where the button is to put the umbrella up and down. In the end that is where the umbrella snapped in two. So just take your time when trying to bend the umbrella to block the sun!
1,radion flyer umbrella,it was a nice idea but it is not very durable. Mine didn't even make it through the summer. It does work good but it breaks very easy. The pole and springs are not strong enough and end up breaking in half.
3,A Taper's Delight,"This little baby is perfect for concert tapers looking for an easy way to attach an umbrella to their stand. Forget about Duct and Gaffer's tape. Just clamp, and you're ready to record in the rain.+T to all...."
5,Great addition to your wagon!,Great umbrella for our Red Wagon when we take the little ones out and about! They love the shade and so do we!
1,Don't waist time and money,Don't waist time and money. this is not what I was thinking and I will gladly give the two I have
3,Provides JUST ENOUGH shade for the wagon,I'm satisfied with the purchase of the umbrella however I wish it covered mor of the wagon. But it is adequate and I don't regret the purchase.
3,great while it worked,"I bought this for the kid's Radio Flyer wagon, it worked for about 5 months and then the clip at the base broke off and is not fixable. I also didnt like how it required me to use both my hands to pry it open to put on and off the wagon."
2,Umbrella,I was so excited to receive this item but when I saw the size of the umbrella I was a little disappointed. The umbrella is not big enough to cover very much of anything.
3,BE GENTLE,"I was psyched when I found this umbrella, but after only a month of use two of the tynes popped through the umbrella fabric. Also the plastic part of the clamp started to crack after 4 months. I did use this item often. Atleast two to three times a week. I will purchase more because quite frankly, I got my ten dollars worth out of it. I am purchasing two now, because they block the sun great!! I will just be more careful when handling it now!"
2,It's cheap,"I like the idea of an umbrella for these great wagons, but this broke 30 minutes into my first use. There's a goose-neck near the clip to allow adjusting the angle, but the paper-thin aluminum tube above it won't take any stress before breaking. I broke it and my daughter cried.The only saving grace is that it's relatively inexpensive."
2,Not worth it!,"We purchased the umbrella along with our wagon. The umbrella lasted only about 2 weeks. As I was adjusting it (to block the sun) the hollow metal shaft of the umbrella bent and then broke in two pieces. Even before it broke, it was not all that useful as I had to keep moving the umbrella as soon as we changed directions and the sun was coming in from another angle.A hat and some sunblock will do your child just fine."
4,Wagon Umbrella,"It's strong but very, very small. Unless you only have one child in the wagon or ride-on, you'll need to buy two. I did and it was worth it."
3,umbrella,"I've ordered this umbrella twice already not because it's the best, but because it has the best clamp on feature I could find to fit onto my children's jeep. It's way too fragile though for a 3 and 5 year old before you can get much use out of it it will bend and break, but the clam will outlast the actual umbrella."
5,Great sun protection,"I am actually using this umbrella for my stroller and it is just perfect. The clib does widen enough to attach to the wide side of my stroller (Eddie Bauer), is strong enough to not slide off etc. and stays in position. Also the umbrella can be bended so you can move it in any direction no matter where the sun comes from. It keeps my little girl in the shade at all times and still gives her enough open room to look at her surroundings!"
2,Disappointment,Although the idea for an umbrela for the wagon is a great one. The execution failes miserably. It broke the first time we used it.
4,Hot graphics light up Ring of Fire,"Set in season two, Doug Petrie picks up the story shortly after the death of Giles' lover. Angel is Angelus. Buffy and he are on opposite sides. A terrible demon, Dru's new boy toy, is about to bring about the apocalypse in Sunnydale. The plot is well constructed. Giles' temptation to bring back Jenny from the grave is very touching. The artwork has a dark elegance. I enjoyed the action drawings. A great deal of care was taken with the characters. I enjoyed this book. I found I read it quickly for the plot and then had to go back and savor the artwork frame by frame. I recommend this to graphic novel fans."
1,"Unable to install 8, while version 7 works perfectly.","After 25 years of building PC, and installing software, beta testing software, I am unable, even with Adobe's technical support staff to install Acrobat Version 8. Software gets to the end of the install process and stalls. No combination of repair, uninstall, reinstall, registry cleaning, advice from THREE technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem. Using XP, with all the latest upgrades, defragging the drives, with 2 MB RAM, and a Adobe Tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software."
3,Product received was not as described,"This Adobe Acrobat product is known to work very well. However, what I purchased was not new as it was supposed to be. The software packaging had been previously opened and retaped. Various other labels on the (dirty) software box had been peeled off and there was no shrinkwrap. The shipment may have been tampered with as there was no packing slip inside or outside and the shipping label was stuck to the ""air bag"" packaging. I returned the product immediately and received a prompt refund."
1,MS Office 2007 v Acrobat 8 Professional,"First, I think it is a rip-off that Acrobat 7.09 or Actobat 8.0 Professional is not compatible with MS Office 2007. I was informed it was necessary to upgrading to 8.0 Professional for it to work with MS Office Enterprise 2007, after doing the upgrade, it still does not work ""as advertise'. Tech Support informs a patch to fix the issues is in the 'works' (right), in the interim 'just' print to the Adobe PDF printer as a work-around - what a mess. Another forced upgrade to 8.0 from 7.09 that still does not work. Sheesh"
5,Wow!,"If the Ark of the Covenant existed it has to be the most extraordinary artifact in history, says the author of this book. Well, if this book is for real then it has to be one of the most extraordinary true stories in history. I really hope it is, because it not only means that the Ark existed but that it also had the power the Bible says it did. It also means that this world is truly a mysterious place. One way or the other, in this racy, apparently true-life historical thriller, the reader is taken on a journey of discovery that leaves you breathless."
5,A brave man,"This is one of those books that leaves you wanting more. It is a well-written piece of historical detective work with some exciting new angles on a biblical mystery. It is also a personal quest of discovery involving Da Vinci Code style code solving - evidently for real. Personally, I am not too sure about some of the strange phenomena that the author and colleagues claim to have witnessed where they believe the Ark of the Covenant is hidden, but it makes a good read. Graham Phillips seems to be a brave man for suggesting he has found one of the Ten Commandment tablets. I would love to know what has happened to both it and the author since."
3,Great photo-documentation of the GT40 reunion,This book contains many large and detailed photos of original GT40's which attended the GT40 reunion held at Elkhart Lake's Road America in July 1994. All versions (I-IV) represented. Light on text but heavy on great pictures.
3,My first GT40 Book,"This was the first book that I acquired on GT40s. It was not expensive, and doesn't have much in the way of technical information, but that's not what it's about. It pulls together almost all of the cars in one book with reasonable photos and anecdotal comments of an enthusiast rather than those of an expert, although John Allen could be regarded as an expert as well.Worth having."
3,Some Interesting Tidbits,"There's little new technical information for the GT40 enthusiast, but the pictures are, for the most part, good. It is interesting to see that most of the original cars still survive, and many are still raced.The book's real value -- at least to me -- is when it is read and compared to other histories of the GT40. For example, it is interesting to see that Ford's 1965 press demonstation car, 1008, still serving in that role, albeit with a junkyard refugee ex-Mustang 289 engine (as of 1994). JWA's 1968/69 cars still survive, although one has an incorrect hood, and two have incorrect paint schemes. (They were repainted to resemble JWA's 1968 and 69 Lemans winning 1076.) This sort of trivia makes the book worthwhile."
5,Round Cable Outperforms OEM Issue.,"This cable is longer, providing connectivity even in taller, multi-bay computer cases, and at the same time allows better cooling air flow than standard oem issue flat ribbon cable."
3,Program good for test prep,"If all you want is to improve your score slightly or test slightly better, this program is OK. It gives excellent tips to taking the test in the computer-based format, and includes shortcuts and hints to improve your score. The math hints are really good.There are a few computer glitches, however. Sometimes when you are navigating through a tutorial you may answer a practice question correctly, but the system will tell you that you made an error. I only found that it did this a few times.Overall, it is good for the student that needs to brush up or reaquaint themselves with the topics covered in the test."
2,Infuriating!,"The biggest idiots I've ever heard except for Rappers of course. This is a band that could have been a great band if it wasn't for the goofy vocalist botching and making a joke out of everything. The musicianship is definately there, excellent musicianship, but comic book lyrics and vocals trash it all! After a few songs of this, the humor gets old real quick. It's sad to see such gifted Southern musicians live up to an outdated stereotype played out by a childish vocalist who thinks all of life is a joke. If it wasn't for this, and they had gotten a real vocalist to sing the songs seriously, they probably would have been as big as Lynyrd Skynryd, and their musicianship gives strong evidence of what should have been, instead of them being reduced to dime store novelty status! Thank god that Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, and Molly Hatchett got it right, and did the South proud with some dignity!"
4,Great and has some good interview questions,"I went through this book quickly. Reading the first few pages I have not seen great differences between this book and the other one on Oracle job interview. The only part of this book that I found very useful is the interview questions. The ""SYSADMIN"" job interview questions are well-written."
5,Great UNIX and Linux job interview questions and answers,"This is an excellent book for any IT manager who needs to find a unix systems administrator or Linux systems administrator. I was impressed with the coverage for the pre-interview stages and how you can identify those job candidates that are most-likely-to-succeed in the job role.Better still, I was impressed with the UNIX job interview questions and Linux interview questions and answers. The job interview questions are designed for a telephone interview, and the IT manager can just ask the questions and compare the responses to the ""ideal"" answer.Overall, this book is a real timesaver for anyone hiring a UNIX SA or a Linux System Administrator."
3,Taylor 1471 is OK but lacks features of competitors,I had a Taylor 1474 digital thermometer and timer with a remote pager. I LOVED it. Taylor no longer sells the 1474 and I received a Taylor 1471 as a warranty replacement when one of my 1474 failed to set temperatures. The 1474 allows temperatures to be set in 1 degree increments beginning at 120 degrees. The 1471 allows temperatures to be set in 5 degree increments beginning at 135 degrees. This gives you medium to well done beef. The 1471 timer function is not user friendly. I've very disappointed with the 1471.
2,am returning,"I did not even open this, am returning it. I bought it to monitor foods in ovens as they cook. I could see that the probe wire is 3/32"" thick and will clearly not allow the turbo oven lid to seat, or the small oven door to close. Package says don't allow door to crimp wire. How can it be avoided??So this model is unusable to me."
5,thermometer and timer,I love this product. You can put it in the food (I always use when baking a turkey) and put it in the oven.
1,Should be called slightly brighter than oem and not blue at all lights!,"Ok so i was excited to finally get these after waiting like a month for them! I got home late around 2:30AM when I got them and once I opened them was so excited to see how they looked at night that I put them in right away. The bulbs appeared to be blue so i was like awesome.. Then I put them in... WHITE! SLIGHTLY BRIGHTER THAN CHEAPO OEM BULBS! I was soooo pissed only good thing about these bulbs is that I have a F-150 that I dont really care about the lights in and they bulbs have a ""10 Year Warranty"" Basically this was a huge waste and not what I wanted. Plus I paid almost 30 bucks for something I didnt even want when I have spent half that on ebay for what i actually wanted in the past!"
1,Do not buy Plasmaglow!!!!,"One of the worst buying experiences in my life. I just burned out my 4th set of bulbs, after buying the original set 7 months ago. I've paid for shipping to and from Plasmaglow each time, filled out the paperwork, and wasted hours and hours mailing them back to Plasmaglow. These bulbs lasted between 3 - 7.5 weeks, not months, not years. 40 years worth of warranty, but I can barely get 40 days worth of life out of them. I am an aircraft mechanic for 24 years, I am installing them correctly, but the filaments keep burning out in the exact same spot. They are deamed faulty by the company, and after I pay shipping both ways, a fill out the paperwork then they'll send me a new set. They refuse to help me, now that I refuse to keep paying their postage! They won't answer my voicemails, emails, etc... This company in horrible, do not deal with this horrible company!!"
3,A few significant glitches,"My child loves Arthur Living Books, this one is great, but the software has a few glitches. Some of the pages wouldn't turn,(click them and nothing happens)and sometimes trying to click the back arrow wouldn't my child got very upset with it..."
3,Drum Stool,"This stool works as a basic stool, but it doesn't rotate so that is a bit disappointing since my kids expected it to rotate and are contantly twisting so much that the top loosens and the cushing falls off.It is not hard to put back on, but very annoying to the kids who are getting a good beat going to have to stop because they fall off the seat unexpectedly.It would work fine if you have a child that doesn't move too much!"
4,"Celebrates out jazz from Tristano to Coleman - ""out there"".","History, styles, and cultural and spiritual implications of the out jazz scene (primarily New York) are well documented in this 200 page text. If you are ""going out"" with your music, this is a valuable reference for recorded music and scholarly texts. Author is multiinstrumentalist and has a background in anthropology"
2,not for me,"I find it hard to say less than positive things as I know all the work that goes into writing a work like this. But I didn't like this book at all. It felt like a bit of an ego trip to me and I didn't come away from it enriched or excited about an art form in which I participate in both as a composer and a performer. Arcana, Forces in Motion and Experimental Music do a much better job than this. Sorry."
3,Great reference,"If you need a reference manual, this has everything. Although, most people need text books for problem solving, whether they be a student or a professional. This book some how managed to completely avoid sample problems. I returned it."
3,"Great book, not in US Standard Units","The content of this book is great except all of the units in this edition are SI units, which doesnt really make life easier if you are an engineer in the US"
3,Another betting progression!!,"There's a lot of good beginner advice in here, but I can't believe that after telling us how there are no valid betting systems the author presents us with yet another betting system! If you're just starting to learn the game and don't know the basics of betting and/or money management, this book could help you."
2,Bad Advice,"I'm not suggesting that you don't read this book, only that you don't follow Mr. Moore's play-of-the-hand advice without doing further research. His opinions re splitting aces and eights as well as insuring blackjacks are bad counsel."
4,Solid value,"This bowl is nothing fancy, but still looks great. It also has a cool textured feel that help prevent it from slipping out of wet hands. It's the perfect size for a single can of soup to keep your warm on those cold winiter afternoons."
5,If you read anything of Poppy's please read this!,"Poppy is one of the brighest stars in the horror galaxy today. While her full length novels can be a bit hard to swallow at times this collection of short stories is hauntingly beautiful. The highlight of the collection is Calcutta Lord of Nerves, though there is not a weak story in the bunch. If you want a book that has a very high reread level this is a good place to go."
4,"not as good as her books, but definantly worth the read","Wormwood was a creative collection of Brite's short stories ripe with gore and the heady smell and sweat of the Louisiana bayous. I loved it, but I must admit I did not enjoy it as much as her books. Maybe I just felt abandoned because they were so short and left me wanting more. I loved that there was a story with Steve and Ghost from Lost Souls as the main characters. My faveorite story was The Sixth Sentinnel. Only Brite can create a story about a stripper and a ghost that loves her and make it believable. Some of the stories made me laugh, some made me want to cry, some disturbed me, but as always with Brite, I did not leave the book the same as I was when I found it."
5,Fantastic,I think Ms. Brite's is comparable to Harlan Ellison in her ability to mix startling imagery with vivid emotion. This book is a steal at such a cheap price.
2,A second rate collection of horror fragments.,"The characters in every story are just about the same; dirt poor teenage-young adult southern goth musicians, complete with homosexual lovers and no place to go. Some die, some don't, but who really cares. The couple things I did enjoy out of Wormwood were grizzly death scenes and well established, disturbing settings. A little black humor here and there at least contributed something towards overall enjoyment, but no enough. Variety would have helped out considerably, as would plots. Brite isn't a terrible writer, but dosen't do anything her pal Caitlin R. Kiernan couldn't do a hell of a lot better."
2,"Vivid stories, but weak endings","Poppy is a talented writer - she paints vivid pictures in your mind and makes you feel like you're part of the story. However, I often felt let down with the endings of the stories in this collection. I enjoy a build up to a shocking ending in my horror, but in this collection you often see the ending coming from a mile away. Other times the stories just end, and you wonder why there wasn't a little more meat to the conclusion. I know this may just be a pet peeve of mine, and I don't expect a ""Sixth Sense"" shock or twist at the end of every story, but I do at least like to read more than just a fade-away tale in the horror genre."
2,Some good...others not,"On the whole I enjoyed most stories, but after Drawing Blood and Lost Souls, which I loved, there's no comparison...Also, the abortion story in this book, the pregnant girl in another had me wondering...Does Poppy hate women? If you've read all her works you'll know what I mean..."
5,LOVE this book,"Essential Brite reading. All fans should read it as well as all fans of vampiric, gothic, erotic thrillers and similar. A book of great short stories"
5,GREAT ALTERNATIVE SIZING,"I love this stuff. These large sheets, I can cut to any size and waste nothing."
5,I was skeptical but these are great!,"I was skeptical, but figured it was a heck of a lot cheaper than what I was paying for the Scotch ones, local. I have been more than happy with them thus far, & on my second box. I use these to laminate preschool/homeschool activities for my children. Great find!!!"
4,does as advertised,Was looking for the best buy on this type of item. It works as advertised providing protection to papers.
5,Great Product,"These are just as good as the higher priced name brands. You can't ask for much more from this product. Very well made and works without any problems. I used on a Scotch TL901. Actually, buying more I like this product so much."
5,Excellent sheets,These work really well. Excellent thickness. Great price as well. These do not smell bad when going through the lamination machine.
5,3 Mil Clear Letter Size Thermal Laminating Pouches 9 X 11.5 Qty 100 (UNV84622),"These are the greatest! So much better then the others that I was using, and the others are the ones that came with the machine. What a great seal around all the edges.3 Mil Clear Letter Size Thermal Laminating Pouches 9 X 11.5 Qty 100 (UNV84622)"
4,Fine for what I need,"These pouches are very thin, but I expected that since they are 3 mil. I think they are great for the price."
5,Great inexpensive pouches!,"As a homeschooling parent, I laminate so much of our stuff, so it'll last through all of my children. These pouches are great quality, and very cost efficient for someone who does a lot of laminating. I buy a few boxes at a time, so that I get the free shipping, and because I go through them so fast."
1,bait and switch,I ordered Universal BRAND laminating pouches. I was sent NO LABEL brand product and they warp when you run them through the laminator. I am extremely disappointed!!!
1,missing items,"Unlikely I placed an order for quantity of 3, I've got only 1 quantity of products though they charged me for 3. It was very disspointed."
2,did not seal completely,These are nice and thick and seem very durable but the plastic only sealed on the edges. Did not seal to the paper which caused LOTS of air pockets. I would NOT recommend these.
4,"They're ok, not the best, but not terrible either.","Ordered these as an alternative to some of the more expensive laminating pouches that are available out there. They're ok. Clarity is fine. Quality is ok. Didn't experience any cloudiness or misalignment of the edges. They are a 3 mil laminate, which isn't a big deal as I'm laminating 100lb card stock, but just keep it in mind that it'll be flimsy if you're laminating regular paper. For the price, they're not bad."
1,Bad batch or bad product?,"About half the sheets will crinkle or not stick at all when laminating. I own a business so not dealing with reprinting things or messing up price sheets is too time consuming to deal with. This is the first I have ordered the large size ones. I have ordered the card size ones before with ZERO problems. My first ten sheets I laminated, I threw away 6 of them. Sadly I ordered two boxes so I am about to open the second box and see if I just got a bad batch on the first box. If both are bad then I will see if I can update this review. They seem SUPER thin by the way. I dont need the laminates stiff but it does not seen very durable at this point."
5,GREAT!!,These pouches are just like as though you got it done at a professional store! I highly recommend it !
3,Warped in the middle,"I used these pouches to make bookmarks for my son's birthday party favors. I had two Scotch pouches that came with my laminator and I used them first. They came out perfect. Based on all the good reviews, I was expecting the same from the Universal pouches but was disappointed to find that the bookmarks that were laminated with these pouches were warped/bowed in the middle. It didn't ruin the day by any means, but I am a little bummed that I have 95 more of these pouches to use knowing there is a superior product I could be using. I think next time I need to buy them, I'll stick with the Scotch brand."
1,Surprisingly disappointed,"As a special ed teacher, I go through a lot of laminating sheets. I have bought this product before and was pleased with the price and the quality. This time, the sheets were sub-par. For every sheet that laminated correctly, there were the same amount of sheets that did not laminate at all. I wasted at least half of my sheets. I was very disappointed."
5,Great product great price!,These cost so MUCH LESS than the ones being sold in store - and they work just as well. I'm very happy with my purchase and will buy more when the time comes.
2,Lamination nation,"I was truly disappointed with the quality of these laminating pouches compared with name brand ones. However, as a teacher, getting more for less is sometimes necessary. Given the number of things that I need to laminate for my classes, I can skimp on the quality for some resources and use the brand name pouches for the more important ones."
2,Not good,I'm not sure if it's the pouches or my laminating machine but it's doesn't seal/laminate properly. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
3,3 ml Laminating,I found this product to meet my needs in creating book markers of my art and photography for sale at shows. I've been using one of my laminated book markers and the product is excellent!
5,Such a great deal!!!,"I just bought the ever popular Scotch laminator and needed some lamination sheets to go with it. I didn't want to lay out the money for Scotch brand pouches so I priced off brand pouches several places. This is the cheapest I could find them. They work great!!! I understand what some reviewers say about the papers getting a little wavy but for my use (homeschooling papers we want to reuse) that is fine. Because of the price I did not take a star away from my review. Also I have not tried the 2 Scotch brand sheets that came with the laminator so I can't compare. Overall, I am loving these sheets! A quality product at an awesome price!!!"
2,Does Not Hold Shape,"Bought this little cooler for the back of our ATW wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc. Cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well, but this a totally soft-sided cooler with no frame or supports, so if there is anything in it, the cooler does not hold it's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon. Looks terrible and I would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or something"
5,Another great idea,"We were kind of surprised to see a cooler for a wagon, but its functional and saves us from having to lug a cooler separately to the beach, or having to haul it inside the wagon. It is big enough to hold a few bottled waters and some ice, or at least a six pack of cans. Neat idea. It arrived quickly, and as with all of our Radio Flyer items, Amazon padded the heck out of them when they shipped. None of these items are breakable, but we appreciate the effort!"
5,it's a cooler and functions as such,"what can you say about a cooler? i put cold drinks in for the kids, went to the beach and got cold drinks out later."
4,Goes along well with the movie.,Well I have to this book goes along great with the film. I am almost done with it. If you loved the movie and want a little more insight on the characters then this is the book for you. I loved the film and I love the book.
4,A GREAT NOVELIZATION OF THE FEATURE FILM!,"This book is great. It is just like the movie, only with a little more dialouge. There are even parts before Lara's dad died telling how he tried to stop the evil. The deleted scenes only able to watch on the DVD are in this book, and I thought that was great! The action level seems a little less than the movie. The book seems to just speed by the action and to the point. I didn't really like that factor. If you liked the movie, read the novel, it is GREAT!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS,I have had better organic raisins. They are super duper sweet. I had two other brands already opened when I bought thse. These were far sweeter but less flave. Some may prefer that. Small and over sweet. Still. This is better than nonorganic.
4,i'm a fan thanks to this game,If it wasn't for this game I would never have found out about the rest of the legacy of Kain games.. if you like block puzzles this is a good game for you.. i enjoyed it... however it is also a disappointment on the combat side... but still it's good game..
3,Fun but it gets boring,"I played this game for awhile and it got more boring , I had to beg my mom to get it because it is rated mature . Dont waste you money, it is a total ripoff if you are not a fan."
2,I was very disappointed with this book.,"Eric Nisenson claims that this is not a definitive biography of Sonny Rollins. I would have to agree. Not only does this book tell us hardly anything about Sonny's personal life (his inpirations, his heartbreaks, his relationships with other jazz musicians), it has neither a discography nor an index. It's list of sources is only a page and a half, half of which seem to be previous books by Nisenson. After an inspired first chapter, Nisenson just seems to list through Sonny's albums and notable achievements, using generous quotes from Sonny describing events that were just described by the author himself. There were some good discriptions of some of the albums and some of Sonny's better solos, but most of it reads like a textbook. I would suggest that someone wait for either Sonny's autobiography (for which he's obviously saved a lot of info) or a ""definitive"" biography."
5,A MUST for our newborn!,The halo sack was fantastic for our child as an infant. We loved them and our daughter slept much better inside one each night. I highly recommend them :O)
2,Very Small,"Lookslike it would be a nice product, but it's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches. My baby is very long and just doesn't fit - wish Target/Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing."
4,Kir's review,"Very nice binoculars. A little larger than I expected, but that is no one's fault but my own. Delivery was fast. Binoculars in good condition"
1,this is a terrible game,"I would give this game zero stars, if the rating system allowed. I bought it for my son. We cannot figure it out; he plays for a short time and gets a disease or some other catastrophe and the game quits and has to be re-started. There is absolutely no customer support, no information for parents. We have not been able to figure it out, and it's too boring to spend any time trying.I strongly, strongly recommend against purchasing this game. In general, my son has really enjoyed games from The Learning Co., but this is by far and away the worst game I've ever seen. We also tried Amazon 3, hoping it would have some system of help or something, but it was just as bad.Total waste. Don't buy it. zero stars."
3,"Weak Book, Save Your Money","Very poor book (not the worse) for a Microsoft endorsed book.The SSIS book also by Microsoft was much, much better (K. Haselden)There were very few real work examples and step by step process.Very mechanical description of report building process and deployment.Did not clearly explain some of the more subtle aspects of constructingmore complex reports.Probably a good reason why it is not available."
2,you can do a home video better than this,This was good during that time frame but too outdated for today. It is not a good teaching tape. It is good for intertainment for older people and people who have no clue about saltwater fishing. It may have some other purposes but for me it is just takin up space in my house.
3,Shipping expense outweighs product!,"This bag was bought as a present for my son so he wrote the comments:Pros - Sterdy and durable bag. Fast Shipment. Nice bag! Cons: REDICULOUS SHIPPING COSTS! Bag comes unassembled. Pain to put together! Disceptive picture. The bag does not look like the picture, even when put together properly. The picture shows wheels, LOOK OVER THUMBNAILS CAREFULLY. ""Mega Only"" in small thumbnail. Overall I like the bag but for $32 dollars and assembly hassels, you might as well buy a better bag somewhere else for no shipping expense!!I don't know why they have this product rated as 18lbs for shipping!! Shipping cost could be cut in half as product weighs 5-7 pounds at the most!"
1,Disappointing movie,This movie was very disappointing. This is not one of Eddie Murphy's better movies. I would not recommend this for purchase.
1,beware,This is not a fun escape read towards the end. Be ready for some not so deftly handled serious issues. I have been a fan of this author in the past and was NOT expecting any sort of serious tragedy. I wish the cover or jacket copy had hinted at what was coming.
2,Dangerous Curves,"When a NASCAR driver is murdered, the best person to investigate is CeCe Blackwell, an FBI agent who grew up around the cars and even beat NASCAR star Blain Sanders in their youths. In fact, he requested her as the agent in charge, but he is the reason she wants nothing to do with the case. Nonetheless, she finds herself back on the track, shoulder to shoulder with Blain, delving into complexities that have more curves than a racetrack. Racing to a stunning ending and heartwarming conclusion is the only thing a reader can do once they set off on this course."
5,Ten long years and a forgotten high school crush....mmm well maybe not forgotten!,"'Dangerous Curves' by Pamela Britton was a wonderful find. This novel is mystery romance novel involving NASCAR, FBI and a old high school crush. Buy the book and enjoy the twist and turns and there are many !!!!! I would recommend this novel and See Jane Score by Rachel Gibson any of Deirdre Martin's novels."
5,A great read!!!!!,"If you enjoy Nascar all the better and if your unfamiliar with the sport not to worry, it is a great who-dun-it with all the right amount of romance. It keeps you wanting more. Ms. Britton keeps you on the edge of your seat with these characters and just when you think everything is coming together- wham! She makes you wait!! BUT the payoff is so worth it!!!!!!!!! Thanks Pamela Britton, I enjoyed it so much!"
1,Sadly disappointing!,"I greatly enjoyed Pamela Britton's historical romances so I was excited to read this one, especially given the other positive 5* reviews. What a disappointment! I couldn't even finish it. It's clumsily drawn with insipid, kind of boring characters who had a weird relationship in high school and are somehow, someway, and who-knows-why violently attracted to each other when they meet again as adults. The female lead is supposed to be a brilliant FBI agent and yet she just seems kind of immature and TSTL. The plot is drawn in crayon, contains very little humor, pathos, suspense or sympathy and does very little to engage the reader. I would highly recommend reading Ms. Britton's other novels, as they're a lot of fun, but I must say that this one is really not worth the bother."
4,Finally a good NASCAR book,I don't read romance but i LOVE NASCAR. I saw that this book involved my favorite sport and decided to buy it. I loved every minute of it. I read it in 2 days. it is going to be a series and i can't wait for the next book. Definitely pick this book up.
5,Great Everything!,"This book is amazingly emotional, yet funny! The hero Blain is not the typical tough guy (although he is a tough guy), he is a hero that actually shows some emotion! He has tears in his eyes on various occasions, where tears would be expected--even from a guy! This makes it SO much more realistic because the problems he faces would make anyone frustrated.The writting was great, the book moved very fast and the author jumped right into the story without giving what can be very boring backgrounds, but does a good job with character development throughout.If you're not a NASCAR fan don't worry, you will still love this book! The author wrote this book in such a different, refreshing new way with the characters actually having more typical reactions/emotions.Great writing, great love scenes, great emotions, great characters, great author, great everything!"
4,"Fast paced, emotional, and sizzling in the chemistry department.","Ms. Britton wove her tale magnificently and Blain and Cece's story drew me in. Before I knew it I was at page 100 and the pages kept on turning! I was taken in by both these characters. Cece is driven and devoted to her career, and after witnessing the effects on her former partner's wife when he was killed in action, she's determined not to let anyone get too close. Blain's no longer the cocky bad boy, he's genuinely concerned for his employees when the Team's future is in jeopardy. Blain's not afraid to show how deeply he feels, and isn't embarrassed for Cece to see his tears. I was ready to shoot him though near the end of the book, thankfully he came to his senses before Cece fully recovered, or I'd have always doubted him. Fast paced, emotional, and sizzling in the chemistry department. A very good read!Look for the Sequel --- In the Grove - HQN 2006"
4,Great Beginner and Intermediate Program,This program is good if you're just starting because it's easy to use. As you get more advanced it feels like it kind of grows with you. I have done a wealth of projects using this simeple program. I plan on purchasing the update version soon.
5,Satisfied Customer,"This purchase was to replace a broken disc. Although this is an old version, I still use it and love it; it's quick and easy; very user-friendly."
3,functional,"It is a camera case and functions as such! Reason for 3 stars: Not sure what would make it special (5 stars), not sure what would make it junk (1 star). Does what it is suppose to but nothing special about it."
5,"Casio Black Leather EX-CASE80BL for Exilim V7, S and Z Series Cameras",Perfect fit for my Casio Exilim Z Camera. Soft material and great construction. Highly recommend.
5,This has everything you need except a buttset,"Very well built tool with lots of goodies. Actually not meant to replace your other tools, but to allow you to do repairs without having to bring a whole toolbox. It has the punchdown tools...well just too many things to mention. It is a little larger than my leatherman but fully functional. Case for it is well built. It was a wonderful Christmas present."
4,"PAL format, great Joel McCrea Western","This issue of Joel McCrea's classic, WICHITA, is in the PAL format, which is different from the American NTSC format. However, there are a number of companies in the US that sell all regions DVD players that will play this dvd (e.g. DVDoverseas). With a title song by Tex Ritter, beautiful photography, a solid cast, and McCrea's ease in the saddle as Wyat Earp, WICHITA is a classic Western, full of action and highly recommended. Warner Bros. has just issued an American NTSC format DVD, so the problem of formats may be a mute issue for those interested. The quality of this issue is fine."
5,Thank God He Wrote This,"The diversity and varying depth of legal theories and critical perspectives created a clear need for this book. Its structure is compartmentalized, and complements its breadth of vision. The various articles, written by leading scholars, are aimed at the introductory level. The achievement is comprehensibility - no advanced degree required. The superior quality of the articles cannot be understated.(Paperback edition) The paper is of acceptable but lower grade quality. The text font is readable but left me with the impression that the publishing company used an old IBM Selectric typewriter."
5,"Complete, thorough, and well written.","This book is a magnificent resource for law students and lawyers. Each chapter is written by a different author, and it explains the philosophy of a different legal aspect (ie contracts, torts, criminal law, etc). Also, each section contains a thorough bibliography of each subject, which is extremely useful.If you don't want to spend as much, buy the paperback edition, but I highly recommend you get the hardcover, as this will be a book you will use throughout your carreer and professional life, and the hardcover is very nicely binded."
1,Just a warning before check-out...,"This pad WILL NOT fully fit the ATW wagon bed.They will attempt to sell you this as an accessory on check-out.The pad itself seems nice and comfy and durable...it just is too small for the wagon we bought/for it was suggested. (I'm not holding it's lack of ""fun"" or ""educational value"" against it either.) Just check the measurements of your wagon bed before buying this to make sure it fits.I personally could have used the extra [money] elsewhere..."
3,Great fit water proof but a bit thin,"We got the pad for our Town and Country which was handed down 2 generations and having been garaged looks great except for some unknown stains on the bottom, I found the pad online and purchased it mainly to cover them up, the vinyl seemed like a good idea however we always had to put a blanket in for comfort as it is hot here in Texas and sitting on plastic is not comfortable. We eventually just bought 2"" thick foam padding from the fabric store and made a terry cloth removable (washable cover) kind of like an over sized pillow case. We now have a happy 3 year old that has ridden in her wagon all day at a theme park and even taken a nap in the wagon. The moral of the story take some time and make your own pad for fewer than 6 dollars you can have a much better alternative"
5,A pad that serves its purpose.,"We bought this pad to go with the Radio Flyer Big Red Classic ATW and it fits perfectly. It provides a good cushion instead of using a blanket, it stays put and it wipes clean. We are very happy with this product."
4,Overall a pretty good trimmer,"I am pleased with the overall performance of this trimmer. It cuts well when dry & and I haven't had any nicks or scratches on my body. It doesn't work very well wet b/c the hair gets matted and the razor seems to have a hard time with it. The razor foil works decently, it seems you have to go over the areas you want smooth a few times to remove all the hair. Also, I would have liked more length settings on the guard. It only has 5 available, and I used to have a norelco that had about 13 precision settings...so if you are picky about the length you trim your hair, there might be a problem. I also like the size, feel when you hold it, & convenience of storing all the pieces in the provided pouch."
3,I'm keeping it but it is a bit disappointing,"Anyone who has had an old inexpensive trimmer that worked well but was nearing the end of its life will find this product a little disappointing for close body trimming. The foil head trimmer is great if you are watching TV and can afford the time to pass the head over and over the area needing a trim. Though it is painless it never gets the job done well. The basic cutting assembly works well on body hair and the self charging aspect is good. But, I guess I was disappointed that this special foil head would be of use--good idea but it is useless. Simpler and cheaper would have made it worth buying.I still reach for my old Wahl trimmer...maybe the new Remington will grow on me."
3,"Nice backboard frame, poor quality backboard",This is a great looking system - but within three weeks the glue holding the acrylic backboard to the metal frame came loose almost entirely.
3,Appears well made but backboard separates from supports,"This combo seems well made, but the acrylic backboard is just glued to the supports without any mechanical attachments like screws or bolts. Within a few months the backboard started separating from the supports. If you have a way of preventing that, it's a good system."
3,"Kai Tak, The Final Days",Title did a poor job of explaining the content that was really on the video.
2,John Bon Jovi Makes A Comeback,"Bon Jovi finally made a new record. I gave two stars because there was only one good song in the whole CD. If you're not a huge Bon Jovi fan, but like the song It's My Life little, I wouldn't recomend getting the album, but if you're a real big Bon Jovi fan you should the CD because the single it's my life is pretty good. I personally liked the song, but I probabaly will not get their CD."
1,This is a SAMPLER - curious to read about Delux vs.,"Although importing and adjusting picture to fit styles was easy, it only had 30 styles. Out of the 30 only 2 really were what I was looking for. The Long selection only had 2, there were 3 bridal ""up do's"" and for short - the selection was slim. It was a good ""sampler"" or ""teaser"" for getting something you could really use, but not useful once you got it. More selection of regular styles would have suite me better. ...Good Luck."
3,"First, the Good News....","(Update): I see that Amazon has eliminated the 'lilac' image it has been presenting for the past 2 weeks. Unfortunately, that gets me back to my original comment. I guess if I were in charge of Amazon, I would hold Johnson Brothers to task for producing such junk.(Original):Nicely packaged, inexpensive and made in England.Now, the Bad:It is unsurprising an image is not available. These platters (I purchased 3) are all seconds. The scene depicted was in sepia and supposedly showed Washington, DC (not the one recently -5/5- added by Amazon). You have to use your imagination though. Try to think of a copy that has been run on a printer low on ink and you have an idea of how indistinct this depiction is.I rated this 3 stars primarily because of the $6.99 price."
4,It works.,"Replacement for my Surefire grill.I didn't check it closely enough. This is a 4 ignitor generator. My grill is a 5 burner. Oh well, I'll use a match for the odd burner out.So far seems to work reliably. Sparks every time I push the button.Installation was easy, direct replacement for the OEM, same design. Wires attached to prongs securely."
1,Doesn't whistle,"The design is nice, handle doesn't become hot, but... this is Non-Whistling Tea Kettle. Whispering instead of whistling during a first boiling and absolutely silent after. I will keep looking for something else"
4,good craftmanship,"After thier underground classic La Naissance, they come out with some different ideas. More produced sounding, not quite as heavy or sad but it is a pretty dark album. Interesting piano parts and a different vocal style that seems to work for a more ""echoy"" sound. This album is to be the last of thier true doom metal sound, and this album also is the beginning of thier gothic metal sound."
4,Great german doom metal CD,"THe music its beautiful doom album that has a lot of variety: femlae vocals, piano sections, harp, death vocals, clean vocals!!!. The grunts are okey, even they have a blackish style vocal on ""Crown of leaving"". This song is one of my fav doom metal song of all the times. I usually prefer grunts to clean vocals but in this CD the male and female gothic-style voices are good worked. Buy this albums if you're a fan of poetic and depressive doom metal.Outstanding tracks: ""crown of leaving"", ""The embrace and the eclipse"""
1,whiny @$$,this guy sounds like he is talking through his nose. save your money and buy some good music instead of rap :)
4,Historical information and a guidline to Poland,"This book is one ofthe best books writtin by Eric P. Kelly. It teaches you the hisotory of poland, and it shows you the customs and other guidlines which you will have to know when visiting such a country. Well that is why I give it a four star rating."
5,Katie is a girl like Beverly Cleary's Ellen Tebbits,"I read this book when I was 9 going in 4th grade. In summer 1985 I was with my family on vacation on the Washinton State Coast staying in a cabin in Grays Harbor area, and Mom would go garage sale-ing during the day. She bought this book for 10c and I knew I was going to like it. The inside title page showed Katie on her bike and she reminded me of Beverly Cleary's Ellen Tebbits. I fell in love with Katie that summer day. The book is so good and Katie is so much like me. I found the part where she and Edwin find the old abandoned farmhouse out at Wildcat Glen VERY VERY interesting. I just wish Katie John would have asked around to find out the truth about the family that once lived there and that they explained it in the story. EVERYONE, READ KATIE JOHN! Mary should continue this series. It is good and I'm sure a lot of people agree!"
4,the lipstick eating stands out in my memory [spoiler],"There, I just gave it away: The protagonist eats lipstick, which while I found it to be nauseating, very effectively reflected the conflicts running rampant inside the preteen protagonist. I recall enjoying it, partly because the setting is Missouri!"
4,book review,I had the first two books of this series given to me and wanted the third. I found it on Amazon. It came in a timely manner and was in great shape Thanks you
2,Don't buy if you're looking for accuracy,"None of these timers are accurate according to the time they're supposed to measure, and they're not even consistent from one time to the next. So they're fine if you just need an arbitrary time limit for something; not so great if you actually need to accurately count down 1, 2 or 3 minutes."
1,50% chance,I purchased two sets of timers. One of the two minute timers does not work. Amazon says they need to charge me freight??!!
2,Timers are not accurate,If you just want these for fun these will work fine.If you want to use them as a guide for a moderated debate then don't get them. They vary widely and are not at all accurate.
2,Timey wimey timers,"The 1-minute timer was good, but the 2-minute timer ran ten seconds short in one direction (not totally sure how it could manage this), and the supposed 3-minute timer took 2:06 to empty in one direction (average of five trials) and 2:18 to empty in the other direction.Mind you, there was nothing in the packaging to indicate which timer was supposed to be which, hence performing the experimental trials in the first place."
3,Nice item for homeschooling,"Mice item for homeschooling, 3 year old likes to just stare at the sand falling, older kids use it to time cleaning, quick cleaning or doing other small chores (getting ready before the sand runs out, brushing teeth, etc.).Editing from 5 stars to 3 stars because the kids managed to open all the tops an now they are useless! Not the companies fault but just thought I would share. Was looking for something more childproof/ waterproof. Also they got them wet and the sand got all wet and sticky and now they don't work either + caps on both end pop off very easily, chocking hazard for baby."
4,Great for the hobbyist or student,"This unit is great for the hobbyist or student that really needs an oscilloscope. It has all the standard features of an analog scope and has worked very well for simple tasks. However, if you need any complex measurements or functions, you'll have to pay up for a digital scope. B+K Precision products are always a great value."
3,For Real Beginners,This book is great if you have no computer background and no idea anout marketing at all. It was not very helpful to me since I have some expereice in both areas.
5,A delightful read,"I found this book to be very believable and tastefully done. I thoroughly enjoyed every story. Within the first week I read it several times before the impact even began to wear off.It helped me to realize a lot about myself and the role this type of activity can play in the human mind and heart. I am not into senseless pain and punishment, but a ""smarting backside"" can have very positive effects if brought to that state by the right hand - as this book shows so well.I will definitely be looking for other works by Ms. Madison. Salud!"
3,A collection of slap and spank short stories .....,"There are nine stories in this book, the first, of course, being The Reckoning. With exh of the stories being 20 something pages it really doesn't give the author time to write what I would consider to be good erotica. I mean in that space can you really develop a character and then have the tantalizing pursuit and capture type of routine.Nope you can't and it for that reason the reader finds himself into the 3rd or 4th apge and already the young girl is receiving discipline ..I reckon it's knda ho hum unless you are into it and have a short attention span!"
3,Tassimo Signature blend decaf T Discs,"Taste is very good, but not rich enough for those who prefer very dark roasts."
2,"way too weak, hardly tastes like coffee","way too weak, hardly tastes like coffee. I wish that Starbucks or Seattle's Best would produce a decaffeinated T-disc."
5,Delicious coffee/cappucino,"The decaf Gevalia coffee and cappucino are delicious and come out perfect every time in the Tassimo. Unfortunately, they're the only 2 varieties of decaf coffee they have available currently, but both are excellent and come very close to coffee house quality."
2,Really light...almost like tea.,"I must admit, I'm a dark roast lover. This decaf is no coffee but rather American tea. If you like a touch of taste at night, this is ok. Otherwise, we Tassimo'ers are sunk without a good decaf beverage."
4,Could be great,"A good tasting, mild decaf that could only be made better if it generated a full cup of coffee like the breakfast blend"
3,A stupid game but bizzarely fun game,"This game is a horrible game.The graphics suck, every one of the 8 wrestlers have the exact same moves and the sound is freaky,like a cow throwing up or something.Whats weird is its kind of addicting and fun.You forget about the ... of the game and have fun, its very weird.But you still shouldnt buy this game."
1,"""Super"" Wrestlemania ?","This was one of the first games I bought for the SNES. To say that I was disappointed is putting it mildly. The gameplay is very lack-luster and the graphics are only mediocre. What really bothered me is the lack of playing options, and the limited number of characters available. This game is one of the best examples of what happens when a new platform becomes available. There is a rush to get games on the market. The first games to appear are updates of games on the old platform. In the rush there is little improvement made to the old game. There are several NES wrestling games that are twice the game this is. If you have to have a WWF game, get Royal Rumble."
2,A SORRY GAME FOR WRESTLING.,THE GAME IS SLOW AND THERE IS NO WRESTLING MOVES.BUT YOU GET OUTSIDE THE RING ACTION WITH ANY WRESTLER.PS IF YOU WANT WRESTLING GET WWF RAW OR THE ROYAL RUMBLE FOR SNES.
1,Stay away from this one!,"Man, this game stinks. If i could give it a rating of ZERO stars, I would, cause this one bites. There are three modes, one on one, tag team, and survivor series. there is no hint of any kind of season or tournament (which even some NES wrestling games had!) but only exhibition matches. Talk about a game that gets boring quick! The sound sucks, (despite that it plays the wrestler's songs) and with only 8 wrestlers, well, you get the point. DONT BUY THIS ONE!"
1,you won't like this game,"Trust me, the Super NES version of Super Wrestlemania is awful in every sense of the word. The way the wrestlers *very* slowly walk across the screen JUST to deliver a simple generic wrestling move to your opponent (because the game company didn't give any of the wrestlers many moves to work with) is worse than any kind of pain you can imagine.I can't believe anyone would consider buying this game, unless they had personal childhood memories attached to it and they were buying it BACK after giving it away or something. The one thing it has going for it is the selection of legendary wrestlers. Once you select one of those wrestlers and actually play the game, you're in for a nasty snail-pace surprise. So bad, so boring, so forgettable."
3,It was the WWF game of it's time.,"This game was always pretty cool to me when it first came onto the scene. But it has no tornaments or many match options. Every charactor has the exact same moves. I'd recomend you have a control pad with turbo buttons, because it was very ""button masher friendly"". I recomend it's sequel tho, Royal Rumble."
2,Not at all good or impressive,"The original Wrestlemania was in no way at all a good game. It was boring, slow and every wrestler had the same exact moves and more or less looked the same.Wrestlemania wasn't meant to be a stand out game. I think it was meant to be the beginning of something else because after this came WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw which some of us plated to death.I would surpass this one and go straight to either WWF Royal Rumble or WWF RAW."
2,Don`t buy this...,"1) Don`t buy if you are looking for a lighter style camera. It ""looks like"" a supersized (over 3x) zippo.2) Don`t buy this if you are taking pictures in not so bright places. The quality is poor and this camera need light!3) The video recording is useless due to the low quality."
3,"It's alright, just took a while to get going...","This book was alright, but took a while to get going because it was trying to get all the historical prospective in. Once the book does get going, it explains how some Generals were going to be wrong on future wars and the way they were to be fought. It named names on who wanted to do away with the Navy and Marines. The battles between congress and the military over the B-36 and the U.S.S. United States were interesting. The last 1/4 of the book is just notes."
1,So sorry,"Sorry folks. I owned one similar to this. I didn't take care of it, and now I'm so sorry. I thought this was my dream come true. NOT!!!!!!Well made it is. To heavy for an older woman, or man for that matter.You have to be in great shape to handle this thing. The handle is a heavy pipe. Whoa!!!! Not for arthritis......"
5,The Detox Solution,"I want to thank Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald for writing The Detox Solultion, because with her help I have been able to alieviate much of the arthritis pain which has kept me from the active lifestyle which I was used to living. The nutritional information, along with all of the other easy to understand suggestions has changed the way I view my life, and has made me want to continue using The Detox Solution to improve other aspects of my life as well. I will always be indebted to Dr. Fitzgerald and her no nonsense approach to good health and to an informed lifestyle."
2,More of the same,"This book does have a lot of information for someone completely unfamiliar with healthful living. However, if you have read other detox books, then this book is not for you. The book reads the same as all detox books that ive seen. It is mostly a primer on body systems and is not a practical guide for a process of detoxification, fasting is barely refered to. This book will tell you to eat healthfully in the vague non-specific manner of attempts at confusing jargon that other books in this genre do a better job of."
5,The Lost Art of Songwriting,"Far and away, the best album of 2005. If you appreciate the musical genius of Steely Dan, you'll love these guys. Excellent production quality, great melodies, old-school composition and musicianship. Guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. Must own."
4,Kengington Mac Keyboard- Recommended,"This Keyboard is a replacement of the same model for my older iMac. Since I liked the old keyboard, which finally wore out, I bought this one, which has been discontinued by the manufacturer. I never used all of the functions that it has, so I can't speak to those, but it is a workhorse in terms of a LOT of Word Processing, E-Mailing,and Web commentaries. It was delivered promptly in great condition as promised, and the price was right. I recommend the seller."
5,panasonic vortex hydraclean,Wonderful product. Cleans razor really well. Handy. Good for 1 month. I love it.Scott
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this game thinking it would be more like a combination of Rainbow Six and Thief. It's more like a hide-and-seek capture the flag with a Myst type navigation. The premise is interesting, but the delivery is kind-of cheesy. This game was a great disapointment, because it could have been so much, but was only so little.One of its major faults is that it is so vast, and the character walks very slowly. There is no way to change the transition speed except to hold down the Alt key while moving. The 360 degree views are cumbersome. You have to click and drag to turn, and it gets old after a while.This is an okay game...."
2,"Reasonably well-written, but ultimately pointless story.","A sad and depressing story of a casualty of war. The places this story unfolds in are interesting and historically significant, which kept my interest in the book. While the horrors of war are well and graphically described, I somehow never developed a great empathy for the main character, Joe. After finishing book, I just asked myself ""what was the point?"""
4,This CD would have been incredible...IF............,"Danny Joe Brown's vocals are barely audible except between tracks when he's talking. Whoever remastered this should have turned up the vocals a tad. If they had done this, I think this would have been one of the greatest live Southern rock concerts ever recorded."
1,A weekend lost,"Fail. Right out of the box. Manufacturing defect.A spring compressor is for one thing only, and this one doesn't do it.I ordered this overnight to complete a spring swap on a rare open weekend. Tool arrived this morning. I opened the box and immediately discovered that the jack screw simply does not thread into the clamp nut. I get about 3/4 of a turn and then it binds completely. The thread on the clamp nut looks like it was cut with a dull tap. I don't have a drawer full of metric acme taps, so this goes back into the box, back to Amazon, and the weekend is lost.The rest of the tool looks acceptable, but that doesn't matter if the there isn't any clamping force.I would expect this in a $40- version of the tool, but at $140-, the parts should at least thread together.What a joke.I'm not laughing, though."
4,I would recommend this book.,This book was very informative. It explained things clearly and was useful in learning Statistics.
2,1995 edition???,"Given the recent changes in Berlin, I was quite surprised that the published date of this book is 1995. As I began looking through it, I became concerned when I read phrases like ""Once Berlin resumes its role as capital towards the end of the century, ..."" Other than the publish date, the book seems great: lots of crisp photos, good touring routes and location maps, and concise descriptions. And its all in a nice compact form."
2,Can't live with this shoe,"I bought this shoe from a big box retailer at a discount price because they looked great and was the last pair, so I got 30% off.These shoes look great, are incredibly comfortable, don't require break in, and work with both business and dressy attire.Unfortunately, I had to return them for a reason mentioned earlier. The fumes emanating from these shoes are intolerable.I wore them on a plane, at work, and had them at home, and could still smell the noxious fumes. These shoes were made in China, and the fumes remind me of the tools/rubber sold at Harbor Freight, which imports tools directly from China.You just can't get away from the smell."
2,Very comfortable but rubber sole wears out fast,"I bought these shoes about 5 months ago and they were every comfortable. However, the rubber soles on them wears out really fast."
2,P.U. They Smell Like Jet Fuel,"Hello--The shoes look great, feel comfortable and are a good price, but they must be using Chinese rubber for the soul or something because the chemical odor coming out of them fills the entire upstairs of my house where I keep them and my co-workers are nicely complaining so as not to hurt my feelings at work.There is such a potent chemical smell that if you are sensitive to chemical odors, I would NOT buy this shoe."
3,Second time is the charm,It is a nice unit but the first one leaked realy bad. So far the replacement is working great. Limit on hose size.
2,Looks good but doesn't work,"I love that this doesn't look like a hose reel, but it's poorly designed. We're going to see if we can get our money back. Otherwise we'll just have to chuck it. There's nothing to seal the water connection where it goes into the reel, so more water leaks out of the thing than goes through the hose. It's a piece of junk. Good idea, though. I hope someone else will make a better one."
2,Handsome but flimsy,"This reel pot is compact and good looking, but it is so flimsy that you need to put bricks around its base in order to keep it in place. Also, it is really a struggle to reel up the last few yards of a 50-foot hose. Its only advantage is that it looks better and is safer (nothing to trip over) than a loose hose lying around."
2,Great idea. Poor design.,The idea of this product is great! (Which is why we bought in the first place.)Pros:1) It will keep your hose covered and protected from sunlight.2) It looks nice!Cons:1) It is designed poorly. The leader hose attachment on the bottom is designed so the hose does not attach correctly. Rather it puts the hose at an angle making it impossible to get a good connection.2) The leader house leaks around the connector due to poor quality.We never ended up getting the product to connect properly and returned it.
3,Incomplete,"I beleive Fire on the Mountain by John MacLean did far more to make change in the fire fighting community than did Scorched Earth. I am somewhat familiar with the Yellowstone fire. I did not see the expected resolutions and perhaps suggestions to go forward with better planning et al that I expected at the beginning of the book other than the tributes paid to the ongoing studies by the various scientists and their assistants in studying the recovery. Such follow up is also ongoing at the Point Reyes National Seashore in California after the Vision fire of 13 years ago. I felt the book dealt more with the controversy of past policy. The ""Ah! Ha"" you'd expect wasn't there."
4,Dense,This book is a classic. It is extremely information dense. It will serve as a great reference for any beer enthusiast.
2,Adequate,"Jackson is no Bob Klein, but no beer writer can be. However, this book is not bad as long as one doesn't expect too much. Hardly the authoritative resource it purports to be and tends to be pretentious."
1,Nasty all around,"The color of the strawberry one is an unappealing opaque pink, something a 50 year old secretary from Dallas would wear. No cooling sensation, either. (And the scent is... horrible 0_0)"
3,no msg ?.... please !,"look at the ingredients , there is msg all over the place just hidden inside different names other then msg."
3,The original NBA LIVE,"This is where the NBA LIVE games started. There has been a billion releases of new versions since this game released in 1994. This game was good, but I strongly recomend NBA LIVE 96 (SNES) over this one."
4,Buen libro de teletráfico,"Explica muy bien cada uno de los modelos de cola expuestos, me hubiera gustado un poco mas de análisis de modelos no convencionales"
4,A Is for Allah,"Peace and Blessings,I truly enjoyed both CDs, A is for Allah and Bismillah.I found myself playing them over and over.Yusuf Islam did excellent on these CDs... makes me proud to me a Muslim.Unfortunately my wonderful CDs were destroyed in Hurricane Katrina and are no longer available through Amazon.If anyone can direct me to where I can purchase these CDs, A is for Allah and Bismillah, please post a message to this site.Thanks,Suez"
3,"Done Well, could be better","As a Muslim, I was pleased that an ENglish language Muslim album had been put out, but was less plesed when I actually heard it. This very much a children's album; not what it had been made out to be. Oh well.For Muslim music in English that is for adults, I recommend ""Soldiers of Allah"", a group that has performed with Yusuf. You probably can't find their Cd outside of the Middle East, so I'd advise you to download it(even if it illegal, it's the only way)."
2,A is for Allah,"Short and sweet. If your looking for the sounds of Cat Stevens, this is not what you're looking for. As a long time Cat Stevens fan, I was hoping to catch a glimpse of his old time work as Yusuf. Unfortunately, as wonderful as his voice is, this is not Cat Stevens. I loved Cat Stevens but Yusuf's albums are just not for me."
4,"simple, inexpensive and very useful","I use this to clip my ipod shuffle to my waistband at the gym. It works great. The attachment to the USB connector is secure. The clip works well. Unlike a previous reviewer, I have no trouble detaching the ipod. With the clip attached, it is a bit of a challenge to access the power switch, but that is a minor complaint."
5,Game for everyone in the family,"I bought this for my 7 year old son. Soon, my husband began to play... then my daughter began to play. It is fast paced and easy to get started playing. The higher you are ranked, the tougher your competition. They all have different styles and first you must figure out your opponent's style before you can beat him and move up."
5,A Classic,"SNES has been ""dead"" for some time now, but I just discovered this game at my cousins house, and for me it was the perfect reason to bring out the SNES. Everything about this game is right on. The graphics are as good as can be expected from a 2D 16-Bit game. Each of the different boxers has many different animations and poses, and it will take a different strategy to beat each one. The sound is superb, even better then some of the pitiful sound that is on 128-Bit games. The controls are VERY simple, and anyone should be able to pick this one up within five minutes. The difficulty level on this game is great, it is challenging, but not to the point where you don't want to play anymore. The first boxer is fairly straightforward, but from then on out it will take strategy to beat them. Overall this is a fabulous game, anyone who likes to play classic games, or anyone with a SNES needs to own this. Highly, recommended."
3,Super Punch-Out review,"This game is gimmacky. All large percent of the boxers have weird names and are weird themselfs like Bear Hugger,Mad Clown,Bald Bull and get this,Bob Charlie which is a spoof of Bob Marley. Some of their finishing moves are weird too like Mad Clown using balls to hit you with,Dragon Chan using kicks to beat you even though that's illegal in Boxing and so is using a cane in which Hoy Quarlow does but the weirdest move is the Hair Whip used by Heike Kagero. That makes no sense. You can't hurt anybody just by whipping your hair. The Upside is that this game is challenging and gets challenging with each circuit and you get to see your name on the scoreboard if you score high enough to. I give this game a 6 out of 10."
4,super punch out,"This game was a fun game which you played for hours trying to beat that one last guy, but it only allows you to use one guy who seems to not have the same quality as some of his apponents. overall it was good, but could have used some work"
3,Tokko,"Over all a good anime. I give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. This is because the story line is really linear. The main character rushes blindly into situations he doesn't understand, and people are always unwilling to talk about whats going on. Its meant to be secretive, but it just ends up getting a little annoying.On the bright side, there is good amount of action, gore and swordplay. The character development is awesome. The Chief is an awesome character.I really just loved the swords. The way they were shown with the sword crossing half the screen. Kind like a line you don't want to cross. Always good.The weak story spoils it though unfortunately."
3,WTF,"This wasn't a great show, but it was good and Ill wactch it again. Tokko had everything I want in an anime. The one thing I HATE about tokko is the end of it! It just ends...."
5,Tokko is cool,"I bought this DVD set last month and It was worth wating 2 weeks because I was getting ripped of lately by rollstone fulfillment and cheif value, I hope amazon puts them out business so they won't rip off anyone else.P.S Tokko is also sexy. -Sign-Gumer Narvaez Jr."
5,Finiky Cat Loves these!,"We have tried other brands that the cat would try to spit out. This brand he LOVES, and can now get out of his basket without crying from joint pain."
2,Information is incorrect in many instances.,"Did this author actually make these hikes? If so, did the author know how to use their equipment and observation to detail the hike? It seems to me something was lacking. More than a few of the hikes are dead wrong even the starting points at times are non-existent. We asked a ranger about one and he said they had never had a parking lot where the book indicated. On at least one hike you need to cross a bridge with no shoulder with a 55MPH speed limit. This was no mentioned in the book. It was an uncomfortable crossing."
3,Several standout tracks amongst an album that should have weighed more,"3 1/2One of the handful of ""emo"" labeled bands whose cynical lyrics, jarring guitar work, and raspy screams still honor the category in the best sense. Despite a brief disc's healthy portion of over-noised, less focused material, Domestica's tense, heart-blackened thematic edge punctuates the few tracks that do all click together, offering some of ""screamo's"" most dignified and melodically informed rantings in the process."
1,Terrible,"Reading the reviews here I wonder if Amazon's computer has got confused, and if you're all reviewing a different album.The album that I bought, after reading many glowing reviews, is terrible. Sub-indie mumbling lyrics, talentless musicians, really I have nothing positive to say about this, except save your money."
2,its not THAT good,"its not bad. a concept album, where the good tracks (the concept part) are broken up by very bad tracks such as shallow means, deep ends. the burst and bloom ep is FAR better, and the ugly organ is (i think) the best album to come out this year. domestica isnt one i would buy, but i enjoy flipping through the good tracks that i burnt."
2,are you nuts,"first off, the cellist wasn't added into the band until after this release. the album is way too poppy to be considered their ""creative peak,"" especially when you have albums such as ""burst and bloom"" and ""the ugly organ."" the latter is exactly what a concept album should really be. shallow means, deep ends. that song sucks. a red so deep. sucks. those two tracks really kill the album, when it is a concept album. plus, this was the last album before tim kasher's collapsed lung, which made his voice sound heavenly. this album was made when he was still some indie rock guy just doing his thing. working a 9-5 and writing songs in his spare time. the ugly organ is a pinnacle of depression and self-discovery. the songs really mean something. the collapse of a relationship is a way-overdone subject. basically, this album is their 4th best. its not amazing. again, i wouldnt buy it."
2,Does Not fit Spike the Dinosaur,"I was very disappointed. I searched Amazon for Spike the Dinosaur battery chargers and this product was the second under in the search, right after Spike himself. The connectors for this battery is different from Spike."
2,9.6 Battery,I am using on a model train it does not hold a charge very long needs to be recharged often if you buy you need to buy two have one as backup.
3,Camera,"Camera was shipped faster than I expected it too. But the back was all scrapped up and has scratches all over it not like a ""like new"" product should have. Also the lens cover wouldn't fit my camera"
2,Poor customer service,Received the brackets on time. Openned the box and found the installation instructions had been damaged (shredded) during shipment. Emailed AutoShepard and asked to have new instructions emailed back. Received a automatic return email stating that they would have someone get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. I then received another email telling me that they were working on it. AND THEN NMOTHING AT ALL AFTER THAT. So my son-in-law and I installed mthem with no instructions and had to remove a couple brackets and replace them when they wouldn't work because a couple brackets had to be in a specific place. Got them and the runninmg board installed okay. Just expected better customed service from this company.
3,No Bracket No Running Board,"For sure without this there would not have been a runner, they go together. So once I received the brackets the board was put on the next day. Luckily for me there was no charged for lift space!"
4,nice book. not as a standard textbook.,"The author makes you believe that electromagnetism is not that hard. It must be his informal style of writing; but his explanations are not sufficient for tackling questions he presents. I bought this book for self-study. The official textbook at my college was Wangsness and it was just formidable to look at. However, Griffiths did not really help me overcome the kind of phobia i had at the time: my real problem was mathematics. (To come to think of it, a good student does not need ``many'' books.) Well, as I said, this book does not have it all but it is a good book. Except for just one thing: I would be glad if he'd be a little more elaborate on the use of Dirac delta function.Compared to 2/e, this book is wonderfully typeset. There are some typos but corrections available at the author's homepage."
2,Dont buy the paperback.,"I made the mistake of going cheap and bought the paperback version from a seller. What I received was a cheap Chinese copy. Even the back cover blurb is in Chinese! The problem is that the paper is inferior, the print is small and the figures are faint and many are unreadable. This may be a good book, I havent yet read that much of it. So far it has been a frustrating experience trying to make out the fine print of the equations and the poor figures. I will struggle on for a bit straining my eyes before I decide if it is worth it to pony up the cash for a decent copy."
4,"informal language makes concepts accessible, but many of the exercises and examples are shallow","Griffiths is a common undergraduate intermediate E&M textbook - and for good reason. The writing is informal (sometimes bordering on colloquial), which gives the topics an accessibility not found in many other intro E&M texts. However, many of the examples and book problems are quite shallow and demonstrate the concepts only superficially; they stop short of the level of complexity needed to force the reader to carefully analyze the concepts and tie them together. There are, of course, problems of this caliber, but I feel that they are disproportionally few. Purcell's book, another hallmark undergraduate intro E&M text, performs better in making the reader really analyze the fundamentals of E&M, as well as tie E&M and special relativity together in a fundamental way that Griffiths does not. However, Griffiths does cover a broader range of topics."
5,This may be the best textbook on any subject ever written.,"This textbook may well be the best textbook on any subject ever written by anybody. When I took my course at Grinnell College using this book, it was as though there were no need for lecture. The professor even admitted that with a text this good, the subject pretty much teaches itself. I cannot recommend a book more highly than I recommend this book. This language used to convey the information is so well-motivated that the student does not have to work on understanding what is going on."
4,Good book,"I don't give the book five stars because it is the only E&M book I am currently familiar with and maybe there is a better book out there. As far as conceptual understanding, the book deserves 10 stars. While it is true that the ""proofs by analogy"" (as well as many of the problems) do not help the student learn difficult mathmatical techniques that Jackson uses, they give a student a much better physical understanding of the subject matter, better then a rigerous mathmatical proof would. If a student is already familair with boundry value problems and wants something to help him understand E&M conceptually, this book is number 1. I'm not saying the problems are easy, they just don't utilize some the the special functions and techniques required to solve certain types of difficult E&M problems."
3,Best E & M textbook available but has two serious flaws,"Griffiths' book deserves 6,7 or more stars if it were to include more examples and answers to odd numbered questions. Nevertheless, it is a pleasure to read this book."
3,"great stuff, but way overpriced","Just like his other books, this introduction to electrodynamics by Griffiths is well written and appropriate for undergraduates, with the necessary math included. But all this material can be found way cheaper in other books. So why is this book so much more expensive? Because it's assigned reading for students, so the publisher jacks up the price knowing it's a captive audience. Commercial exploitation pure and simple."
2,confusing and time-consuming,"Although I know this is supposedly THE book for E&M, I find it is lacking in explaining concepts. Problems are just thrown at the student; one does not even know how to approach a problem, let alone actually solve it. I've spent a tremendous amount of time conferring with other students in the course or getting help from my professor than I have spent on actually working the problems."
3,Meh,"BOOOOOOORING! This book has lots of good math in it, but the plot is kind of disjointed and I don't really feel attached to any of the characters. Who is dipole and what does keep hanging around with an electric field? I just don't get it.In all seriousness, I understand that this book is a ""good electrodynamics textbook"" but I don't think it's set up in a way to facilitate learning. It's written more in a narrative form than anything else. I know this is personal preference, but I don't like to have to dig through pages and pages of text to glean an important point. I'd rather just have the major equations all laid out at first or at the end of each section and then go into details."
5,All inclusive book!,"This book has been my goto text for 1.5yrs now, and it will be for a lot longer. Griffiths hit this one out of the park!I unfortunately bought a used copy of this and received a publisher reject that had light ink (none in some spots) and a couple torn pages. I don't want that to detract form this book in any way, it is top notch!"
5,Excellent book for self-study,"I am a physics PhD grad student. I started this book during undergrad and finished in first year at grad school.Griffiths clearly has a gift for educating. He nails every single hard topic and explains it in the most clear way possible. Every time you get a bit confused about something, for example why there's a negative sign in front of the derivative, Griffiths' next line will be: ""you're probably a bit confused about why there's a negative sign in front of the derivative, that's because...""I think the problems are also very helpful. There's a solutions manual you may want to get your hands on to help you work through a bunch of problems as you learn the material."
4,Electromagnetism Textbook,"This is a good book for upper level undergraduate physics class. One should solve book problems before jumping into exercise problems. Derivations are little hard to follow sometimes. If your instructor is using this book for E n M class, make sure to get your hand dirty."
3,"Well written, but not a good standalone.","I used this book as a reference in a yearlong E&M sequence. Although I agree that the book is well written, I also think it has several flaws. First, the topics are presented in a desultory fashion (Special techniques in Chapter 3?). As many others have said, the book needs an answer key. Griffiths mentions that many people advised him against odd numbered solutions - tell them not to read the answers!I found 'EM Fields' by Wangsness to be much better as a text. I don't think Griffiths has enough math (or detail about electrostatics) in it. Granted, the book is meant as an introduction, but many people think they can read Griffiths and then go right into Jackson. I think many of the people who subsequently whine about Jackson simply haven't had enough of the basics."
5,The undergraduate standard,"This is the one you are most likely to use as an undergrad in physics. It's been called ""verbose"", but I appreciate that many steps are explicitly spelled out in this book. I have used Wangsness, also good, for a review before grad school, but Griffiths is the best."
3,Is this for students?,"This book is reminiscent of most text books, lots of writing and explanations along with lots of pictures and schematics, but it lacks in the mathematical arena. Some of the proofs and equations seem to be plucked from thin air (However, this isn't entirely bad).The only real issue with this book is the lack of a solutions manual. How can a student tell if they are actually learning E&M if they dont know the answers to the problems? How can a student move on to the more advanced subjects E&M if their understanding of the basic material is incomplete or skewed?If Griffiths included a solutions manual, this book would be a great text to learn E&M from. However, it does not include a solutions manual and this adds much more complexity than is needed to an already complex subject."
4,Introduction to Electrodynamics,"This was an excellent book for electrodynamics. This is very good for those who are new to this subject. Gives great examples. More student friendly and does not read like the typical reference textbook that gives vague examples and even more vague solutions. My only thing, this book should have a student's solution manual. Outside of that... the book is great. I will use it as a tool when I go to graduate school in the near future."
4,Quite good for an excellent price,"The condition of the book is quite good, it's new for an excellent price, and fast shipping I had it in 3 days. The book itself is great, just easy basic straight words, which makes it easy to learn. I would apreciate more examples."
4,Good spine,The book has seen better days but what is inside is quite nice. The author is quite funny. Doesn't really follow through in the math. It shouldn't look like magic as much as it does. I guess the algebra is for your teacher to show you...
3,Great Book,"Use this if you want to learn E&M.; 5 Stars (Amazon won't let me fix the star rating)This book is clearly organized, hits all the salient topics (at an Undergraduate level), and has plenty of example. Griffiths is sure to provide physical intuition as well as equations and derivations. This is the first book I go to when I don't understand Jackson, although unfortunately not everything in Jackson can be found here."
4,Griffith's E&M is great,"It's a great book for an upper division E&M class, I've used it in several of my physics courses. It's in depth and detailed examples demonstrate the concepts beautifully. The problems in the book are weirdly interspersed in the material, but usually the material that covers the problem is immediately adjacent. Making referencing the book for ideas on how to proceed a breeze. This is not a light read, sometimes it takes a day or so to really digest a chapter. That said, the way the material is presented is thoughtful and detailed. The front cover alone, with it's identities and math hints. A must for any physics geek."
4,"Very Different, But Good","My favorite thing about Griffiths is the way he writes. At times, the book can be a little frustrating, but Dave Griffiths knows how to write a book, and you can tell that he enjoyed it. Its written in the first person, first of all, and the sense of humor that comes with that is very obvious. It is cogent and concise, sometimes to a fault, but always supplies plenty of examples in just the right places that will provide you with everything you need to solve the homework problems. There are times when the problems can seem very difficult, and even impossible, and this is what the solutions manual is for though I wish I wouldn't have had to resort to it as often as I did.Highly recommended."
2,Not as good as you think,"I took a electromagnetism course as an undergraduate using this book. I could follow the examples given in the book, but the book failed to provide enough information to properly grasp the real concepts of electromagnetism (and do the homework problems too). It didn't help that the prof. wasn't an effective teacher either. With a good instructor, this book may be ok. If you are trying to work through on your own without help, plan to spend ALL your free time doing so. I sure did."
1,sucks,the book was half the size of the normal book and the print was terrible. the letters were stuck to adjacent pages!
1,no good,"His approach is getting you to learn the material *by yourself* by doing the problems. It's a nice idea, but when it ultimately falls flat, nothing is explained to you and you haven't learned a thing. Over two semesters, I've spent close to 10 grueling hours a week working his problems - and in the end it's been a waste of my time."
2,Introduction to Electrodynamics,"This book gets two stars because it is exceptionally readable. That is its sole redeeming quality. As a textbook it is a failure.The test of a text is simple--A reasonably intelligent and mathematically prepared person should be able to start at the beginning, read the text, work the examples and then be prepared to solve the problems at the end of the chapter.This text so ill prepares you for the end problems that if you can solve them, you probably didn't need the text in the first place. The examples given are simple, rudimentary compared to the later solutions asked and principally unconnected. When an example is complex, such vast leaps in mathematical continuity are found that one must question whether the author just looked up the solution somewhere and jotted it down."
5,A wonderful bridge,"I fully agree with the concepts expressed by other reviewers that have rated this book with five stars.I add the following: Griffiths' book is a wonderful bridge between the elementary physics textbooks (for instance, ""Physics"" by Resnick, Halliday and Krane) and the advanced treatises in electrodynamics (of which ""Classical Electrodynamics"" by J.D. Jackson is a venerable example).It is compasionate to the student interested in the subject but who needs more handholding than others more mathematically gifted. A pleasure to read and to cherish. The world needs more David J. Griffiths.A Community College Professor of Physics."
4,watch editions,"Great textbook, amazingly readable, but watch out which edition you have. The so-called ""Eastern Economy Edition"" (paperback and marketed in Asia)is missing a few things, notably labels on some problem diagrams. If you don't have friends with the real one, be sure to avoid that."
2,Awful text and here is why:,"I think I can understand how everyone in my class loved Griffith's book ""Introduction to electodynamics"". People like this book because he spends a lot of time explaining difficult concepts. and does not focus very much on the math involved. However, the problem with this book I think I have found and it is this:IN THE REAL WORLD YOU CANNOT SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS BY RESORTING TO CONCEPTUAL EXPLANATIONS BUT RATHER YOU NEED HARD PROOF.what do I mean by this?I mean that griffiths spends so much time elucidating concepts that he DOESN'T explain the important mathematical proofs and facts. This book is extremely frustrating for a physicist who wants to SOLVE ACTUAL PROBLEMS."
2,sub-standard E+M book.,"This book seems to have been adopted as the standard undergraduate text on the subject, but it is severely lacking in content. I find Griffiths writing style rather unorthodox, and excessively wordy. The chatty discussions of various topics will leave you dazed and confused, and the exercises leave much to be desired. Also, be warned that there are no solutions for the problems, which makes them useless, in my opinion."
3,There could be more important theory in the book.,"This book, should allow the student to be able to solve the problems just by using this book. It does not. A solution manual to this book should be provided for.Someone please e-mail me back on this."
2,Introduction to Electrodynamics,"I read this book in library,a bit different from others ,and i think that it is not for those who do selfstudy.The third chapter is silly.Especially the part image problem.Author simply guess a function and showed that it satisfied boundary conditions and laplace equation.Then he said okay this is the function because the uniquess theorem said there is only one....I wonder if every physicsts used this way to figure out the nature law,what will happen...."
4,Great for physics undergraduates,This is the first math-type book that was easy to read and follow. The author uses great examples and speaks in a more informal manner. I did not find it a chore to read. The only fault I have with this book is the lack of a solutions manual and not enough sample problems. If you are a struggling physics student this is certainly the book for you.
5,Good presentation of the subject !,The best thing about this book is that it's contents are in right sequence ! Quite often the subject matter is jumbled but here the author has started with Calculus giving ample background about the tools we use for QED /ED etc. and has proceeded in similar fashion throughout the book. The prose is explained with rare lucidity but still the level of problems is not that tough as I expected !
4,Very good text,"Yes - this is a good intro to electrodynamics, just as everyone says. It isn't a substitute for Jackson - they are in different classes, each with their own intended audiences and purposes. If you're fairly new to the subject, here's a little secret: in addition to this book, get vol 2 of The Feynman Lectures in physics! There's no equal to Richard Feynman when it comes to conveying complex abstractions in ways that even a caveman could understand (not even Geico Insurance). Later, when you're already grounded in the subject, by all means, knock yourself for a loop with Jackson."
4,"Fun, very fun","Clique ridden and predictable as others have said but that does not make it any less fun which s why it gets star number 4. Its turns into your basic Scifi story young man that doesn't think he is capable of anything in the end is capable of everything. The first part of the books will have you thinking ""Starship Troopers"". The second and shorter part of the book (when the soldiers actually get to where they are going) will have you thinking ""Armor"". If you liked any of these two books you should get this book. Its rather like watching books have children more of a homage then an actual stolen plotline."
4,Good Stuff,"Ok, so it's a total take off of Heinlein, but who cares, it was still fun to read. The main character isn't as noble as Starship Troopers and it doesn't get into the politics as much, but it was a lot of fun to read about some of the systems and tools they were using. Instead of everything being hypothetical SCI-FI it was more like a future technology that you could extrapolate from what we have today. Very fun!!The book was worth reading, but it won't be a classic."
2,A weak effort,"This book is more military fiction than science fiction. Most of the book is about boot camp training and interpersonal relationships of the soldiers. There is very little talk of science and technology in this science fiction.That might be okay if you expected it, but this problem is aggravated by the fact that the characters in this book are weak, all minor variations of a brave but dumb soldier who triumphs despite the supposed incompetence of scientists and intellectuals.When I finished this book, I felt the same as I do at the end of a Steven Seagal movie, entertained a little, perhaps, but feeling like I just lost several IQ points."
2,Unbelievable drivel but harmless,"Its a harmless read but not really a very good book. The story line is very simple, and to put it plainly, unbelievable. There are a series of very improbable events that move the story from chapter to chapter - e.g., chance assignment to MI, judge shows up to get him out of administrative hearing, gets put onto shuttle mission with minimal training, etc., etc. The phrase repetitive ""duex ex machina"" comes to mind. If you can suspend your logic powers long enough, the story arrives at the conclusion you would expect. My advice would be to skip this one."
2,Re-read Starship Troopers Instead,"I like the review that say the author stole they whole thing from the Starship Troopers and the Forever War, but liked the book anyway.The only interesting part of the book was the background story of how the troopers are being sent into space with 50 year old technology and mothballed ships because after 50 years of peace no new technology was developed. Maybe if the author had fleshed out that plot without approriating a plot and characters from 50 year old novels it might have been a decent book."
1,Save your money.,"If you are looking for good military SF, this isn't it. This book and it's sequel were mildly entertaining reads. As a former Infantryman, I found Buettner's writing to be the Walter Mitty daydreaming of another REMF ""wanna-be"". The kind of guys who never had the balls to be in a combat arms unit, but who love talking about their military service.To compare his writing to Heinlein, Drake, or Ringo is to do these men a great disservice as both authors and soldiers. These were men who experienced life at the sharp end, and it shows in their writing.I would advise anyone who is looking for ""authentic"" combat SF to look elsewhere."
4,Good Space Opera ----,This was my first introduction to Buettner's work and it was a good one. Well written and a good premise for a series based on orphans. I highly recommend it. Good detail for military buffs and realistic scenarios --
4,Likeable adventure,"This here's a rather likeable, if predictable, military scifi adventure. The main charactor, Jason Wander, is pretty solid and I'll look forward to reading more of his future adventures. Not nearly as good as John Scalzi's ""Old Mans War"" but light entertaining reading."
3,"Fun, Heinleinesque Military SciFi","ORPHANAGE(2004) is written in the vein of Robert Heinlein's STARSHIP TROOPERS, and John Varley's RED THUNDER.The book's main character is Jason Wander, who is given a military option instead of jail, when he starts to become rebellious in a foster home situation, after his sole remaining relative has been killed in one of the projectile strikes against Earth's cities by aliens who are intent on taking over Earth for their uses. After a eventful boot camp experience, Wander is assigned to support a Division of Space-Faring Infantry ""Orphans"" to try to save humanity by exacting revenge on the aliens whose base of activities has been tracked to the Jupiter moon Ganymede.ORPHANAGE is a fun and quick read, but at times is a bit unbelievable, unscientific and semi-juvenile.I give this book 3+ stars. I've started reading the sequel ORPHANS DESTINY, and I'm so far finding it to be a more mature offering."
3,Solid but unorginal adventure,"Jason Wander, eighteen years old, with no particular skills, in trouble with the law, and with his only family killed in the alien attacks that are slowly destroying Earth's ecosystem and killing the human race, somewhat involuntarily enlists in the infantry. He does not suddenly discover that this is the life he was born for, but he does, eventually, decide that he doesn't want to fail at this, too, or let down the few people who believe in him. He makes some appalling mistakes on his way to that decision, and it's not smooth sailing after that, but Jason does start to make a foot soldier of himself. When an expedition is dispatched to take the war to the enemy, at their base on Ganymede, Jason and his squadmates are part of it.This is a book that borrows heavily from all the great buddy war movies, as well as Starship Troopers and The Forever War, and freely acknowledges its debts. Orphanage doesn't break new ground in the genre, but it's a solid, enjoyable read."
4,Damn good read.,"I have heard it said that all of the current fantasy fiction is from authors who needed more hobbits and dwarves and wizards. That they could not accept the loss of Tolkien. I have never been able to accept the loss of Johnny Rico, Carmen, Sgt. Zim and the Roughnecks. I have not been able to accept the loss of Robert Heinlein and now I don't have to.Mr Buettner has given us a homage to ""Starship Troopers"". Yes, it is derivative and I can see Rico, Raezcak, Zim and the others in this novel. Since Heinlein didn't give us the rest of the story Buettner has. I would classify this as juvenile fiction in the same vein as Heinlein's juveniles. He has different characters in a different unvierse but is telling the same story. Not of glory, but of sacrifice. Not of great ideals, but of the man next to you and the unit you live with.And he is going to tell us more.Good enough for me."
3,great sci-fi book with good action,"One of the better sci-fi ground troop novels I have read in a while. I agree with other reviewers that there were many cliche's used but it was well written with clean plot lines and fun characters.I felt the book was just the intro of hopefully a long series that will get into more depth.It was a fun read, brutal and fast paced with no punches pulled.The training and the ""family"" relationships were great and I enjoyed each character especially Howard and of course Wander"
3,It's the voice that makes it special,"I can't add anything about the plot's similarity to STARSHIP TROOPERS (the book is marketed as a homage), but if you like good military science fiction focusing on training and first combat and unlikely heroes, this should be a solid read.Super first contact chapter!What makes this book special and compelling is the voice of the narrator. Every once in a while, a narrator kind of rents space in my head and gets to stay until his or her lease runs out on the last page. This one would be welcome to renew! Great storytelling."
3,A Good Military sci-fi work,"It would be wrong for me to say this piece goes beyond the lable sci-fi milporn and is true science fiction. It's not. The characters, settings, and pro-right atmosphere bear all the hallmarks of that shallow, silly, genre.That said it is a good book. Starship troopers was the first of this type of work, so it was understandably too busy breaking ground to show too much depth. There Is No Darkness, was and still is, the best version: characters with depth, true science fiction, military an intergal but not overbearing backdrop. This work is a very good contemporary update of Starship Troopers. It breaks no real ground, but it is interesting. Its a step below Sten, but a jump above anything by Drake."
5,hot!,"The saz pieces on this cd are blazing! The first piece alone is worth the price, 20 minutes of the most burningly passionate and inventive music you're likely have ever heard."
3,Movie,"I would say this was a mix of drama, dramatic idiocy, horror and comedy. I'm not sure how they pulled it off, but that's how I viewed it. I wouldn't buy again, but at least it was slightly entertaining."
4,Otis,decent movie funny to watch a couple people torture some guy they thought kidnapped their daughter...i really cant believe amazon is making it so you have to write all this garbage just to review shit
5,Really Good Blood & Guts Movie!,"This is a serial killer movie that you can watch over and over again. It's a story of misguided revenge with a lot of mistakes along the way, making it extremely funny. The family of the abducted girl gets in on the action taking justice in their own hands when they realize what a bumbling fool the authorities are and they get down to business in a hilarious way. This movie is a cult classic. Watch and laugh until your cheeks hurt!"
2,Poor Attempt at Dark Comedy,"This movie tried very hard to be a clever dark comedy, but they wound up making a mess. The ending (or rather the last 30 min) was horrible. For sitting through such an atrocity, you'd think they could at least give me something to make up for it, but they didn't. Very derivative and with horrendous dialogue. By the end of the film, I was so disgusted that I felt the need to warn people. Apparently a lot of people like it though. I don't know why, but I guess there are a lot of people out there with poor tastes. Or at least a taste that doesn't require much to entertain them."
1,F class director / plot,"first part is actually pretty good, that the girl got kidnapped and managed to escape.The 2nd part totally ruined the movie... rather than calling the policy and catch the SERIAL KILLER, the family decided to go after the SERIAL KILLER themselves...? :? and found and tortured the brother instead? ... its NOT FUNNY AT ALL, typical STUPIDITY that does not make sense."
5,Best 1-2 Punch on CFMX/FLASH MX in the Industry,"This book delivers.>>> Dennis and Ben hit every nail on the head with a great instructional piece! The new features of the MX platform are powerful and confusing, yet with a focus on architecture and simple, elegant implementations, this book is a must have for the intermediate Flash/CF Developer who wants to break the ice on building Rich Internet Applications (and can't figure out PetMarket for the life of them) or the advanced developer who wants to see how 2 of the best developers in this realm would handle real world situtations."
2,alright,"good content for those who already know flash and coldfusion. however, that said, still has some holes and seems somewhat rushed to print. not sure if will answer many of the questions those new to remoting (everyone!) will have. quite mediocre."
3,"Decent introduction, but it's only an introduction","This book provides an acceptable introduction to Flash Remoting with CF, but there isn't enough code or explanation to allow you to start on your own until after you've learned both CF and Flash well independently. Also, at least 80% of the book talks about methodology, fake meetings, requirements gathering, and stuff like that--not the stated purpose of the book.If you have extra time, I think it's worth a read, but if you can't read everything you want to, you're better off concentrating on Flash and ColdFusion specific books."
5,Very useful book and well written!,This was an incredibly useful book on integrating Flash and ColdFusion. I have done integration with the two products in the past but this book provided useful pointers and techniques that will prove invaluable for my next project. The real-life concepts work great as a learning mechanism throughout the book.
2,Only Flash/CF book,"I don't understand the fuzz about this. Maybe I am wrong but for now this is the only CF/Flash MX book I have found. But I am far from amazed. The layout and style of writing leaves a lot of blanks, The book is built in self-proclaimed case studies. Case studies where pages printed in 45 degrees, making it unnessesarily hard to read the text. Code is not clearly written and is sometimes 'hidden' inbetween descriptive text...now, I did not like this..."
2,Dissatisfied,"I bought this software and was really excited about using it only to be let down. When using this software it shuts down by itself and you lose all the work that you have done. Also when adding furniture, appliances, or accessories; they tend to float.....Yes, they float in the air and you can't fix it unless you delete everything and start over again. I have sent a couple e-mails to the company complaining of these problems and have received no feedback. DO NOT BUY!"
1,I really didn't like the ending at all,"I am a HUGE fan of E. Phillips Oppenheim. I love his books. This one though....hmmm, without giving away the ending, all I will say is that I hated the ending. Sorry, bit this book was so disappointing. Don't base your opinion of Oppenheim on this book. He's such a wonderful author."
1,worst game ever,This is not a good football game not compared to the Nintendo 64 one. I try to sell it the most I could get was 0.01 and that was a ripe off. Don't get this game save for something like on Nintendo 64 and NFL Blitz or NFL Quarterback Club 99.
3,"Hasr,s review",enjoyed it very much need a list of songs for each album of hazel dickens--hazel dickens& alice gerrard with a price list for each Email if you want to Thank You H.A.
1,Get them for free from Bose,"What a rip off. I went to the local Bose store and they gave these to me for free. $4.99 a piece, WOW!"
5,Bose AC-2 Bare Speaker Wire Adapter/Connector - Black,Good product that is a must to use with the Bose Premium Jewel speaker which produces an excellent and credible .
1,Cheap fan that didn't last long,Bought this fan for a boat and it worked only a couple times before it quit working. I'm back on Amazon looking for a better quality 12v fan for the boat. Wish me luck!
3,Another Great Read by Peter B. Waite,"As usual, P.B. Waite has written another biography that reads like a good novel. Whether you are an avid Canadian Historian or you are new to it, this book will shine some light on the life of one of Canada's lesser known leaders. From average Halifax boy to one of the most dramatic deaths in the world. ""The Man From Halifax"" makes for a great round of nightly reading."
3,OK if you want a Trial History book.,"I was disappointed with this book. It seemed ""flat"", something was missing. I think that there was not enough critical commentary and analyis on the closing arguments selected and what made them the ""greatest"" closing arguments in modern law. The book essentially gives the facts of the case, a brief commentary on the summation, then the summation itself. If you buy this book, read the table of contents first so that you know whether or not you are interested in reading about the chosen cases. Otherwise the book will not be a good read."
2,This is great rhetoric?,"I was tremendously disappointed with this book. It contains nothing but the blathering of lawyers, who everyone knows use words as though they were bludgeons. For anyone seeking wonderful speech, artful rhetoric, or earth-shaking persuasion, seek elsewhere. I suspect that Mr. Lief, et al., have chosen these arguments from the narrow view of lawyer-hood, without much regard for their true value as speeches--but then perhaps I ask too much of the reviled profession. In any event, skip the commentaries (I wish the authors had--I'd have given them another star if they had)."
2,Compared NBA LIVE 96 this was a huge downfall,"NBA live 95 rocked, and then 96 wiped the floor with it. Then this version of 97 came out and really went down hill. It was not as much fun to play as 96, the graphics looks a bit smoother, but the shots looked really weird and lay ups looked stupid, dunks were about the same but the fun factor was out of this version. I recomend NBA Live 96 for the best version on SNES."
2,Not for everyone!,I have never taken a Spanish course before and this deffintily didn't help me at all. There is dialoge on the CD's that isn't writen in the book so it is next to impossible for someone with no experiece in spanish to follow along. I would not reccomend this package.
4,Better than it looks,"Berlitz have on their web site audiscripts with complete dialogs forthis product (as well as for their other products).They also have there ""Learning guide"" with Spanish grammar.All this makes this product much better than it looks rightfrom the box."
2,hardly useful,"This replacement battery was a complete waste of money. I used it once or twice fully charged, it gave me about 25-30% of what the normal Canon battery gave.If you need a replacement battery, invest the money and get the real Canon one. Trust me. Don't waste money on this garbage."
2,Music overpowering songs,"I bought the DVD because of Bruno Pelletier and his talent. I am a French teacher and was interested in showing the musical to my students. Unfortunately, the music overpowers the singing. Sometimes,you can't even hear at all the singers. I think the sound quality of the recording is horrendous. I am French and I had real difficulties to understand what was being said and though understanding the plot. I would not buy this DVD. It's a shame because the setting is beautiful, the singing is good (from what I can hear) and the music is quite cool (it has a rock feel to it)."
5,Preschool boy loves it,"My preschool boy loves this TV show. He also loves discovering the world around him and this show does a lot of that in a fun rhyming way! He's also learning rhyming in school so its a winner for him! It's kind of funny that they gave the little boy, ""Nick"" an ethnic makeover compared to the original character I knew growing up but it doesn't matter. Kids don't care. And the Mom has an accent too. Martin Short makes a great cat-in-the-hat and I remember his voice from the Three Amigos movie with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase from back in the 80's."
5,The Brass Bed and Other Stories,"Pearl Cleage is a WONDERFUL storyteller. Her short storieshere echo the warm, authentic voice readers of her novelshave come to know and love."
3,It fits Honda Civic Del Sol,"When I got my Honda Civic Del Sol it did not have any trunk lifts in it. I had to use something to keep the trunk open. Honda wanted too much for the replacements. I got these from Amazon and they fit. Not the best quality. Honda makes better ones. But it fit, and it works. The connector is cheap. So far, it has been working okay."
4,Decent Football,"This was always one of my favorite games for the SNES. A good feature is the create your own High School team, and you can also play college and pro. Gets easier after a while against the cpu, but is always fun to play with your budds."
4,doon on diane,"i enjoyed this video. the ""voice-over"" reading was one that was familiar to me, it was a taping of an art-talk diane did before her death. i wish the quality was better, it was hard to see the details of her photographs, but hearing her daughter talk about diane was interesting. the highlight of the film was doon's hair....hand's down."
4,Great as a 1st Game!,"In this Nancy Drew 3-D interactive mystery, you (playing as Nancy Drew) are visiting friend Rose Green in San Fransisco, CA in a beautiful, old, full of history, victorian mansion. Rose and her friend Abby are planning on turning the mansion into a Bed and Breakfast. But strange accidents are dellaying the project. Who (or what) is causing them? Only you can find out!! I recommend playing this game 1st if you are new to the series. I did, and it is what kept me hooked on the rest of the games! This game is fun, challenging, and exciting! A little scary at times, this game is just like a movie!!!!!"
4,The haunted review,This game is great. The only reason I didn't give it a five star review is that it was a little too short and you couldn't explore very much. But this game is fun. I thought it was really scary. Well not really scary but scary. Some parts made me jump. The game is cool. I played it about 5 times and I just got it. This game is great! But be prepared for the spooky things inside the mansion.
4,Very good!,"This set is very good and sturdy. If you set the net up right, it will stay there and will not move. Well not until someone crashes into it. The set up is very easy and very simple. The only bother about the set-up is when the guy-lines came out of the packaging and tangled up. It is very easy to tangle up the guy-lines, so when you un-box the net, make sure you wrap the net around the thing that you wrap the cable around the yellow rope holding thing. ( I don't know what it is called) Overall, the set is very good and sturdy, the net itself is very loose though. It is not like the ones that are tight at the bottom. This didn't seem to bother me though."
3,Backyard fun as long as you have a big backyard,"The Volleyball set comes with just about everything you need. The tie down rope that holds the net taught lacks a locking slide so cinching it up requires some creative knot tying.The rope that comes for the court size is regulation size which means it takes a lot of ground to create the right size court.They provide solid iron pegs for the tie down rope which seems like they could rust real easily. Best not to leave it out in the rain.the net at the bottom is held in place by large fabric loops that you pass the side poles through, it has no way of becoming taught so it just kinda hangs there loose.There are no volleyball rules with the set so you'll need to know how to play beforehand. Or you could just make up the rules as you go along.All in all a fine volleyball set with only minor quality issues."
4,Pricey but nice quality,"This is a nice, quality backyard set. For some reason I did find the tensioning instructions a little cryptic, and it took me a while to figure out that aspect of the set-up. Otherwise no complaints."
2,Cute and nice little fogger...,I purchased this fogger for my fountain (not too large) but have discovered that it's just a little too tiny to fill the basin of my fountain. I need to consider a larger version.
3,"Difficult, of little practical value to most","I would like to stress the comments of the previous reviewer. This book should come with a warning label: uses a non-standard romanization system (why use a romanization system at all when writing for an audience this advanced?) that is HARD to pick up, and this book would only be of use to Korean Linguists and the very most advanced students. I think that there are better Korean grammars for student purposes that are easier to understand, even when they are entirely in Korean."
3,Whut no glossing?,As a linguistics student this book is very comprehensive but falls flat on its face with regard to a very important detail - the lack of glossing in examples. Nothing is more frustrating than having to figure out the meaning of morphemes and words on your own especially when you're not using the book for learning but to write a typological essay or some other assignment (that needs linguistic examples)
5,My Nephew Loved It,My 9 year old nephew is intrigued by dinosaures and LOVED the book. Especially the way each page pops-up with a detailed looking dino and also the surprise of additional smaller pop-ups on each page along with discriptions.
5,Fabulous!,"This book is not just for children. The fantastic cut-outs on every page are breath taking. The book is also very informative if you can get the children to sit still long enough to read each page. You tend to want to turn each page quickly to see what wonderful new dinosaur will pop up. We purchased this book for our grandchildren ages 4 and 11. We also have the Christmas books which my grandaughter insists I bring out every year so she can see the pop ups. We will continue to purchase these books, both for ourselves and to share with our grandchildren and anyone else who comes to visit."
4,Super cool with LOTS of details,"My son received this as a gift and loves the pop ups. It seems that they are hidden everywhere (several on each page- 1 main feature and several smaller ones). Just when you think you've read all the info there's more! I would say its more suitable for a 5-6 year old+ (my son is 4). Although he loves the pop ups, he runs out of patience with me trying to read all the details on each page. Very cool book though and I'm sure will be a favorite over the years."
5,These Dinosaurs Could Make Video Games Extinct,"I recently gave this book to a seven year old who hates to read.When he saw that I'd given him a book, his polite ""thank you"" echoed disappointment. But after he opened the cover you couldn't pry it out of his hands. His mother was equally fascinated with by the book and its magical ability to get him to abandon his video game.The dinosaurs are colorful and cleverly engineered. The text is engaging and educational. Definitely the definitive pop-up book. Appropriate for anyone over the age of three."
5,A surprise around each page,"I bought the book as a gift for my 6 year old nephew. When it arrived, I just wanted to see some of the pop-ups and how they worked. Along with my daughter, 45 minutes later we were done looking at everything this book has to offer. I could not believe the detail and the number of pop-ups contained in this book. What a beautiful book."
5,Another Amazing Sabuda Book!,"I have loved The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, and Sabuda's new book is in that same spirit. The pop-ups are so intricate and colorful, and the pop-ups within the pop-ups supplement the info so well! I am nervous about letting students use it, because I love it so much I don't want it to get ruined! So buy one for you, and one for your children."
5,Great book for Dinosaur fans!,My kids (7 & 5) received this book for Christmas and just love it! It's one that they continue to pick up and look through almost daily. The details in the book are incredible! There are also little mini books on each page with even more dino facts. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with children interestd in dinosaurs.
5,Super Primer,"My five year old son is totally into dinosaurs and we bought this book for his birthday. He loves it. I was a little worried about how durable the book would be but it is made of good, heavy stock and we haven't had any problems yet. I'd recommend it for any young paleontologist."
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"We purchased this book for our nephew. It is absolutely amazing. The pop-ups are so neat!! There are large pop-ups in the center, then each page has 4 additional pop-ups in each corner. When our 23 year old son saw it, he wanted one also!! What a buy for the money!! Looking to get the other books in the series."
5,"""Wow"" ""Holy Cow"" ""Neat"" ""Cool""","These are the adjectives I heard within the first few minutes of my nephew opening this book. It is amazing, magical and delightful for both kids and adults. I purchased this book for both my nephews as a Christmas present. They live in 2 different states and their families have very different lifestyles and yet this book appealed to them both equally. I did not get to read it but have gotten positive feedback on content (besides the pop-up part) already. I do have to mention, both my nephews are ""careful"" and I noticed right away how gently/slowly my nephew turned the page to be sure the picture folded properly. He did a better job than I would have. When I give a gift I don't stress if it gets broken but if you are going to be upset if the child rips something, unless the young person ""knows how to be careful"" best to wait or only take it out when you can read it with them. I think the pictures/pop ups make this book well worth the price...they are magical."
5,Pop up book collector,My son and every boy I know loved this pop up book! Not to mention the pop up book collector in me!
5,Diosaur pop-up book,I LOVE this book! I only hope I don't wear it out before I give it to my four-year-old cousin!
5,Love Sabuda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sabuda's Pop-ups are a constantly source of amazement for my sister. We are full of admiration for the skill and intricate detail that goes into creating these masterpieces. I got this book last Christmas together with Sabuda's pop-up ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Nowiki's storyWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 2- a charming story with a lot of information about from the world of felines."
5,Pop Up for OLDER kids!,"This book is great, but definitly for a child who is very careful with books. We bought it for our son when he was 4 and just bought it for a cousin's daughter who is 3. It really depends on the child. The pop ups are amazing though...and once the child is older will still be a book they can use because of all the detailed descriptions. I don't think we've ever read the book from cover to cover - more like an encyclopedia!"
5,Encyclopedia Prehistorica: Dinosaurs,"I bought this for an eight year old boy who loves dinosaurs. He absolutely loves it, but so did everyone else who was there and looked at it as well. Each page has one large dino who pops up, but also has multiple small popups behind what look like mini-books on each page. Visually it is beautiful, but it is so interactive it will catch the attention of any kid probably just about any age."
4,fascinating but not really practical,"This is an incredible book filled with interesting facts about dinosaurs and related trivia not found in any other children's expository books I've read. There are pages within the pages that open up to reveal intricate details of numerous dinosaurs unknown by many children. The only drawback is the likelihood of parts being torn off (mistakenly) because of the delicate composition of the pop ups. It is actually well made, espcially for the type of book it is, but will be viewed over and over again by small hands excitedly turning page after page."
2,Not happy,I expected a new book. This was used and taped in certain places. The binder was dented as well. Would have paid 10 for it not over 20.
5,Best. Pop-up. Ever.,"A number of pop-up books were purchased for a daycare with children ages 2-3 years old. This book was one of them.It is by far their favorite book, and it's easy to see why.First and foremost - the pop-ups are amazing. They are very detailed, colorful, and there are plenty of them, probably the most in a single pop-up book (but don't quote me on that)The reading content in this book is great, as well. There is a plethora of information about many dinosaurs, and things related to dinosaurs.Bottom line, if you're looking for a gift, or something to do during reading time with kids, this is a must have."
5,Gorgeous,"I saw the Dragons and Monsters book at our local Museums gift shop and was spellbound by how complex and creative the book was. I have a 3 year old nephew that is in a major dinosaur-phase, so I ordered this book for him and I am not disappointed. It's intricate, and amazing. I can't wait to see his face light up when he opens this book."
5,Dinosaurs,This is a great book that I bought for my grandson for Christmas...I know that he will love it..he likes pop up books and dinosaurs so I know he will love this.
5,Fantastic,"An absolutely fantastic Pop-Up book.Illustratively, each page contains one main pop-up highlighting a particular dinasaur. There are generally three or four other minor pop-ups on that same page that highlight the characteristics or other similar dinasaurs. The smaller pop-ups are meant to compliment the text and other pop-ups.Even better is the level of detail on each. We are not talking about four pieces of paper glued together. There is a level of detail I have not seen in other books.Finally, each page is accompanied with text. Obviously, this part is intended for an older reader, but it is quite useful. I've read it to my 3.5 year old and he is engaged by both what I am reading, and of course, the pop-ups.Highly recommended, and is certainly one of the best of the pop-ups that I have seen, and definately one of the best Dinosaur books for little ones that I have found."
3,Good book for the do-it-yourselfer,This is a good book for the beginner who doesn't have a lot of experience with electricity. It tries to cover the most common wiring jobs that a person might have to do around thehouse. It is a entry level book with many color photographsto help you understand what to do.
2,"OK, but not very advanced","This book is fine for basic electrical work. But there are much more informative books out there which cover basic through advanced electrical work such as Richter's ""Wiring Simplified"". Richter's book doesn't have the snazzy photos, though."
4,"I would give it five, but it is old","This book is very detailed in how to do basic wiring. It even gives advice on more advance types of wiring. It also goes into basic home networking. The only major problem with this book is that it is an older version then what is out now. It is still a good reference to use. When it has been awhile since I did any wiring, I refere back to this book to get it right.I would have given this book 5 stars if not for the age of the book. It is still a great book for wiring, but there are newer versions on the market."
3,WE KNOW HOOO BUT WHY,"Brooding and atmospheric, CRY OF THE OWL is a complex and interesting psycho-thriller. Bizarre coincidences set up Paddy Considine's fall into a murder scenario involving a somewhat wacko played by Julia Stiles. Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, OWL is slow-paced but involving. But when we find out the who, we don't find out why or how those involved crossed path.It is this plot twist that left me dissatisfied.OWL is well crafted but left me wanting more."
3,Weird and creepy,"This movie could have been better. It kept you guessing about everything, but left you feeling just,,,meh! I was disappointed in the acting.Julia was good, just not great! It's hard to review this movie."
4,Twisted ending,"The previews of this movie looked really suspenseful. I like Julia Stiles' acting. Although I enjoyed this movie, at the end I just said ""Huh?""."
5,Amazing Read!,Victor has done it again with this great story! This story is a great read for any woman who is struggling spiritually with finding their soul mate and letting go physically and letting God have his way in his time. All good things happen in time if you are willing to be patient and believe in him. Thanks Victor for another great book!
4,"Superb, buy this book.","Single mom - Upper exec - Grace is tired of sleeping around and wants her own husband. She meets the right guy, then her baby-daddy wants to step back up and be a father; Drama. Things get real twisted up. Good book."
1,deceived,"I bought this book thinking it was a Christian book and I felt I was deceived. The celibacy plot and the scriptures used to support it were good, but some scenes were too graphic to be considered a good Christian read. It took me almost a week to read this book when it normally takes me 1-3 days. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,A must read..,"This book started out kinda slow for me and then i gotten into and found out that Grace in the beginning of the book was just a full blown ""HOOCHIE"" (smile) but as i read further the book deals with real life stuff! not sure about anyone else but this book had me laughing out loud alot..so much i had to remember i was by myself reading and look around so no one around me would think i was crazy..Ladies if you be real with yourself and realize you and Grace might be or once was in the same boat, it gives you hope that God can and will turn that mess around and cause it to work for your good!"
4,Down on my knees,"This was a very good book. Started off slow, but it's well worth the read. Lots of twists and turns. Victor, visited with our book club (Reading by the Branch)this month and he provided insight from a male's point of view. He was very down to earth and open to discussing all aspect of the the book and his life.Pick this book up! Invite Victor to discuss it with you."
2,"Cheap attachment screws, mouse support flimsy etc.","The attachment screws to secure unit underneath table are cheap, they strip easily. The mouse attachment causes the keyboard support to lean to the right and as you type it bounces up and down.These people charge premium dollars for their product and put in cheap screws to attach the unit...stay away...bought it becuase I had to."
4,Perfect Storm Soundtrack,Hope that the movie is as good as the soundtrack. I really enjoyed John Mellencamp's contribution to the album.
5,Stormin Mix,This is a great collection of songs thrown together to help a amazing movie. The tracks are nothing but hits. I highly recomend this Cd.
3,"Good, not great...","Horner hasn't done much lately, that's for sure. Maybe I expected a little too much with the combination of Peterson and Horner. This score definately sounds alot like Horner's Deep Impact (1998), and is equally good. Neither have extremely memorable themes, but are fun to listen to anyway. They also create the same mood in each film. Horner has definately done better, but this isn't a bad one to add any Horner fans collection. In my opinion, out of the 3 scores just released (Perfect Storm, Chicken Run, Patriot) this is the weakest, but again, it doesn't mean it's a bad score. See the movie (which I found surprisingly good), if you like the music, pick up the cd."
2,"James ""The Andrea Gail"" Horner","Talk about a sinking ship! James needs to go back and look at what made scores like ""Kahn"", ""Braveheart"", and ""Legends of the Fall"" so great. The score just never opened itself up. It seemed almost confined and unable to explode into a mode of strings and brass. There were subtle reminders of The Wrath of Kahn and Legends of the Fall, but before any true rip-off occured, the notes softened and continued in the boring manner. Two stars only because its Horner. I look forward to his future works which no doubt will be works off art, but this is not ""A Perfect Score""!"
1,6 notes that repeat over and over,This was one of the only soundtracks that actually distracted me from the movie because it's so annoying. The whole soundtrack is a 6 note phrase with different chords underlying it. Hearing those same 6 notes over and over again makes me grit my teeth. It's the worst music I've ever heard from Horner.
2,Horner does it again...,"I don't know how one can love Horner's sounds. Ok, He's written good scores in the past, but over the last ten years - with the exception of Apollo 13 and Braveheart - it seems that he's been writing variations over the same theme. I can't stand this guy anymore! Please, James, improve your musical sense! What about ""The Perfect Storm""? Quite Boring, boring, borii..., bo.., zzzzzz...."
5,Chops,This is a MUST SEE for music lovers. The enthusiasim from the kids and the outstanding talent they possess is something forgotten in today's highschool life. Music programs are being curtailed all over the country and everyone should see this film and understand what a waste it is to trash that talent. We gave this disk to my son's high school band leader and now it's shown to all his music students..WHAT A MOVIE !!
2,Excellent Quality. Horrible Timing.,"The book came in excellent quality. Although the timing was a DISGRACE! I ordered the product on the 5th of August on Expedited Shipping. The estimated delivery time was August 10, 2010 - August 17, 2010. I didn't get the product until August 25th. I don't know if this was the sellers fault or Amazon's poor performance on this promise, but from now I'd rather take my business elsewhere. I prefer something/someone reliable."
4,This is a great introduction to fixed-point methods.,"This little book can take a bright high school student or undergraduate through some most interesting territory, previously uncharted at this level of mathematical understanding. Fixed point methods -- approaches to problem solving based on the simple equation f(x)=x -- are ubiquitous and ideally suited for digital computers, but they are seldom introduced in the classroom. Get this book for your high school library. Use it as an independent study for that student you don't want to set loose on calculus quite yet."
5,Perfect!,"This comforter is just perfect! Soothing earthtones combined with a sophisticated tropical design make our room a relaxing, comfortable haven. Shipment was prompt and comforter was packaged well, keeping it in pristine condition."
3,Insightful,The book has a unique perspective that teaches us not to overlook the small things since then tend to have the biggest impact in our lives.
4,A Voice of Experience,"I think I would've found this book more helpful had I been newer to the technical writing game, because much of what I read sounded like obvious common sense. But, reading this book did serve as a good gauge to compare what I've learned on my own to the author's experience. The book is a very easy read and Bremer's style is very snappy, linear, and concise. I also enjoyed the quotes interspersed throughout the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is not a full-time writer but has been given writing tasks, or any new technical writer (preferably someone working in the software industry)."
5,"A unique, user-friendly, invaluable guide.","Michael Bremer's UnTechnical Writing: How To Write About Technical Subjects And Products So Anyone Can Understand clearly and cogently explains how to write and produce good documentation, and how to deal with the business side of writing as well. Michael Bremer even addresses such tangential issues as office politics and using the bottom line to get management support for better documentation. UnTechnical Writing is a unique and invaluable guide for anyone charged with the specialized responsibility of writing user-friendly instruction manuals for any kind of product."
3,Dated but useful,"I had to purchase this for a technical writing class. The writer's humor is a bit goofy and the material is a bit dated, but the techniques discussed certainly stand up under time. The checklists and other forms in Chapter 10 were especially useful. There was one aspect of this book that, if they decide to do a updated version, I would love to see changed: lose most of the quotations. I know that the quotations are there to help humanize a technical topic, however, most of them were pointless and there were far too many."
5,well organized and practical,"This practical guide to growing healthful herbs includes 20 specific plans for such things as cold and flu gardens, healthy heart, windowsill medicine cabinet, skin care, first aid, hair care, relaxation garden, and lots more. Recipes - culinary as well as medicinal - are included with each garden type.The book begins with an overview of medicinal herbs, with their uses, cautions, and raising and harvesting advice. The ""at a glance"" box directs the reader to the gardens (always multiple) the plant is used in, so you can see what complements it and how the plant is used.Tables include specific plant care and propagation advice and uses in the garden for attracting and repelling bugs. Byers includes the basics on getting started, garden maintenance and harvesting, but the heart of this book is practical herb use. Byers even concludes with an appreciative and practical chapter on the wild herbs, otherwise known as weeds."
5,Great Book!,This book is everything I hoped it would be. I love the breakdown and categorizing in this book. It makes herbal gardening easy for even us beginners. An absolutely GREAT book!
3,live helper,I'm a forigner and Enlish isn't so good.But I interested in the subject so I browse them in your website first.I trust you offer books are useful for readers in everywhere.
5,A totally entertaining novel,"Walter Keady's 'Mary McGreevy' is a delightful novel about a strong Irish woman in a town that is not quite ready for her. I was inspired by her wit, courage and independence. Mr. Keady tells this story with warmth, humor and plenty of heart. His obvious affection for the residents of this small Irish town really gives life to the characters he creates. I highly recommend this book! A superior read!"
2,Catholics BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It's not my favorite book of all times but it did strike up my curiosity and make me think.Being a Catholic I could see all the points being made and understand a lot of why Mary did what she did growing up and going to the convent and her choices for leaving. Also, somewhat like Mary I wanted a child at any lengths and if I were to never get married I would've done exactly what she did. In the 1990's it just wasn't as much of a scandel as the 1950's. It also brought up a lot of valid challenges against the Catholic church as well as pointing out that things aren't much different with time. The Catholic church is still the same although women are some what of a more active now.If you are looking for something that questions faith and argues for and against it this is the book to pick up. Even though I wasn't overly pleased with the book I did get caught up in it BUT in the same sense I wanted it to end."
5,Walter Keady,His writing has also kept me interested from beginning to end. Both Mary McGreevy and Celibates and other Lovers were captivating and interesting.
3,DOGS?,"My large breed dog is required to be on MSM, but I am not quite sure if it is this product can be used for dogs as well??"
4,MSM Powder,"I am using it for my dog, I am not sure of how much it helps her, as I am using it with another ordered medication. Again prompt delivery, and would recommend it for joint problems for people and dogs. Dog dosage is lower than a persons."
4,Good product,"I bought this product hoping it would help with some tendonitis in my forearm. Well, the tendonitis hasn't gotten better or worse. But, my knees feel amazing. I have problems with my knees when I overdo with my workouts. This product has helped to ease the after effects. I've only been using it for about a month. I'll continue to take it. So, I'm hoping eventually the tendonitis will disappear."
2,Mediocre,"I agree with the author. I find many of the creative attempts of the mainstream Christian culture very bland. I feel that we have lost many of the traditions of great writers like C.S. Lewis and artist working in a myriad of other genres. However, aside from communicating his premise and a few morsels of truth this book falls on its face. I was left to puzzle out specific examples of mediocre art, no specific examples were given. Further the author also jumps into tirades about abortion. Abortion is wrong, but what does that have to do with the arts?I wish that the author had some training in classical argument, or had hired a ghostwriter to present his arguments. If he had I might not be left with the irony that his book is mediocre."
4,A Mind Opening Book for Christians and Agnostics alike.,"An excellent book with a lot to offer the continually diminishing world of quality Christian art. Lot's of opendendedness in my opinion--do this, but how. His book is where practicality and creativity collide. I don't think he INTENDED to give any answer about how to do it other than: CREATE. He did draw some excellent conclusions about how we (Christians) have compartmentalized almost everything in our lives and placed certain values on different vocations and ways of life. Necessary reading for Christian actors, writers, visual artists, and housewifes wishing to raise children that think."
2,A Mediocre Book,"Schaeffer has a few valid points that could be developed into strong arguments to support his thesis, yet he fails to organize his thoughts and he does not substantiate his claims with concrete examples. This book needs strong editing and perhaps the ranting could be turned down a few notches as well."
4,Good addition to my library,This book fits well with other similar books as a welcome addition to my growing library of books on art and Christianity.
2,"mediocre, unfortunately","Yes, Schaeffer's point is valid. This book, however, reads like a rough draft--too many redundant thoughts, too many one-sentence paragraphs, and not enough specifics."
1,Disappointed,"The title for me was a real attention grabber. I could not find Addicted to Mediocrity in my local library and eventually ordered it from Amazon.com, I just had to read it.I must admit that this book was a big let down. I found the author to be a little bit to cynical for my taste. I also felt the author had a very difficult time coming to a point and using some specific examples for his arguments.I do agree that the average church in America is lukewarm in their daily Christian walk. And also that life in general in the United States in not lived on a creative edge.God created us in His image and He created the world we live in. If we are made in His image we are creative as well and all of us have a different way of expressing creativity.Maybe Franky Schaeffer should stick to art and forego writing?"
3,Nothing but grumbling,"If you are interested in a travel book about England, don't waste your time on this one. It is more about pubs and hitchhiking than the places visited. I loved Bennett's WHERE UNDERPANTS COME FROM and HELLO DUBAI, but MUSTN'T GRUMBLE was very disappointing. Unfortunately Bennett didn't seem to do anything but grumble and he didn't like much of anything in England."
4,good replacement,good replacement. a little tedious to install but it revived my T3 and it works great. well worth the money if you are still using a Palm and would rather keep it going vs. replacing.
4,divine right of kings,"Church's collection of essays on Louis 14 is most distinguished. Contributors include Voltaire and Montesquieu. The contributors hail from times much closer to Louis' reign than to ours. While perhaps not quite contemporaneous, they offer lucid assessments of how effective he was, in building the French nation-state. As well as maintaining an absolutist monarchical regime; the envy of other European kings.Here, largely unchallenged, are accounts of the divine right of kings to rule. Unblemished by dissidents that lay decades and centuries hence. The book is useful, in a meta-analysis fashion. For it is not just the views of its authors per se, that the reader should consider. But the predominant world views of the times in which the authors wrote."
3,An entertaining read,"Dry in places (and bursting with denial) but fun to read nonetheless. I learned a few new tricks that may well work for me (providing, of course, that nobody else has read this book)."
1,Difficult to listen to . . .,"Not for the faint of heart, this album had a jarring effect on me the first time I heard it. Each song blends into the next and the overall grating impression is of plunked strings which underscore monotonous wailing in Malagasy. The melodies are repetitive and not likely to have wide cross-over appeal to Western listeners. I would like to say that I have a gained a greater appreciation for Sakalava music since I moved to Madagascar, but these chants still get on my last nerve. The one halfway catchy tune, accompanied by clapping, is track #4 ""E ly e."" The musical bow featured on several tracks is also intriguing -- particularly because it is not cluttered by the tuneless wailing which characterizes the other songs. Ditto for the flutes and lutes. If you do buy this CD, listen for and enjoy the traditional instruments, but I have to say I'm glad this is not all Madagascar has to offer."
1,"0.5 STARS: The ""Secret"" is that it sucks.","""Secrets of the Clown"" is a movie that tries to be clever, but it falls flat on its face. This movie is basically about this guy who has a hard time getting over his friend being murdered, and strange visions and things start happening that indicates a a malevolent supernatural force is at work. It's too bad that this movie is not only not scary, not interesting or entertaining in the slightest. There is no style and very little substance to this movie and the ultimate result is a lackluster so-called horror movie with no atmosphere and no suspense. Plagued by wooden acting, horrendous plot execution and a lifeless script, ""Secrets of the Clown"" is best left a secret from everybody. Half of one (1) star is the final verdict here."
3,Goofy!,"Ed Wood would love this film! It's one of those weird films that was filmed wrong, acted wrong, has a woman with a Medusa hairstyle, cheesy blood...and just plain dumb dialogue.It does have a few good points...from a b-movie perspective. It teeters on the it's-so-bad-it's-good line. There are insider jokes throughout the film. ""You killed Ken"" ""Those bast*@%$"" It was at this point I realized the makers of this film had no real serious intentions on telling a good story or presenting it well. They wanted a rotten movie and laughed the whole time making it."
1,Obviously rigged reviews....,These reviews are obviously bait by people associated with this movie. Buyer Beware! Something smells!!!!
5,"i have to say , as a person who reads true crime stories oft","i would like to say that , as often as i read true crime stories, this is the first defendant that i have ever actully felt sorry for and i would like to know how he is doing. i feel that the author did a wonderful job of putting all of us in his PLACE and i wonder how he is doing in custody and how his family is doing. i would like the author to respond if he can. i have never felt sorrier for anyone."
4,A fragmentary minor work of a master,"Joyce in Trieste was enamored , or perhaps more correctly lusted after his young student, Amalia Popper. The record of this never consummated romantic relation is the subject of this fragmentary minor work of the great master."
5,masterpiece of James Joyce,"you can't to read all books of Joyce. You can to read only ""Giacomo Joyce"" and you'll understand of Joyce in whole"
1,"Just Trouble, bad item","VERY VERY cool idea, but the USB implementation is the worst. It took me 2 hours with numerous D-Link reps, who were all very nice, but none of them understood how to get the network drive humming. (Of course the manual doesn't explain it either...) Finally I did get it working, the drive needs to be Fat 32 - which sucks for us Mac users wanting to name our files whatever we want... I tried to test it by transfering a 150mb file. It was going to take 2 minutes, which is VERY slow and what do you know it crashed the router on every try. This unit is going back right now unfortunately. Can't wait till they fix the issues and make it much quicker..."
1,Avoid it like plague,"I read about this product on D-Link's website and bought it. This product is bad. (1) Documentation to connect a USB port is non-existent. (2) Tech support guys are friendly but are unable to help. I've spent close to 10 hours with tech support at D-Link and none of the level 2 or 3 technicians have been successful in getting a USB device to work. I returned the product for an exchange, but my new product did not work either. I've researched a lot on Google and found that almost everybody has had similar problems. Don't waste your time and money buying this product."
1,Utter Junk,"Utter junk. USB is impossible to use. The wireless throughput is slower than a dialup. I bought it and spent 2 hours with D-Link customer support and they asked me to return it for a replacement. Not sure if that is going to help, since i think the product is faulty and replacing this piece is not going to change one thing.There is no firmware update either. If I could, I would give it zero ranking."
2,Not enough security,"The router provides with it advertises. However, there are some problems with they way that it provides everything. First is the fact that it doesn't have any in-depth manual that tells you how to use the features on the router. Second, the setup for the shared folders is not documented and the support available from a tech is non-existant. Third, the wireless encryption is manual. You have to setup your own wep key or whatever type of key you want.Overall I don't like this router because you have to fumble through everything to get it working. Once it is setup its fine, but it will take the average user about 3 weeks to get EVERYthing going."
4,Very entertaining reading,"The 6th in the Jonathan Argyll art mystery series, I enjoyed this title as much as any of the others. The return of a protaganist featured in the previous book, made for very nice continuity, but the book would certainly be enjoyable even if you haven't read any of the others. The ""team"" of Jonathan and Flavia compliment each other in skills... and I personally enjoy the foreign location settings (primarily Rome in this book). The story lines are better than average and the characters are reasonably well developed. I recommend that you read ""Giotto's Hand"", if you can, before ""Death and Restoration"" for maximum enjoyment."
3,"VERY comfortable, but ripped quickly","After years of spending $30-$40 every few months on cheap moccasins, I decided to splurge on the fantastic Ugg Moccasins. I paid $120 for these and they shipped so quickly and I immediately sprayed them with the protectant sold by UGG. After less than two months wearing them outside, they began to pull apart. I was very upset but I called Amazon about my issue and they immediately apologized for it and offered me a full refund so I could purchase them again. I love these shoes, they are warm and are exceptionally comfortable."
1,Readiris pro11,"My printer/copier/scanner/fax is so old that the scanner software I received with it is no longer compatible with my current computer so I researched scanner software (probably for windows machines) and settled on Readiris. I received it, installed it and used it. So far the results have been so bad that I have ended up just typing the information that I wanted to scan. With the old software (mac OS9 compatible) I would have to reformat the OCR text but did very little typing. With the current software there is very little I don't have to type. I feel the ""Readiris Pro 11"" I purchased is a waste of money, I won't use another product by this company."
1,Didn't finish reading it,"Just my opinion but I thought this book was long, boring, with unlikeable characters, unbelievable plot. Should have asked for a refund."
3,Interesting Video,Anything that will educate people as to the artistic genius of Kertesz is a good thing...to my way of thinking....This black and white photographer was among the earliest masters..It was great to see some of his photos (although there are many more that could have been shown and were not)....I enjoyed the video...
2,informative enough,"I've never heard of this artist or his work, but I think photography fans will like this documentary. It was easy for me that think, ""This guy is the Ionesco of photography."" However, Ionesco was Romanian and this guy was Hungarian. Just as many African-American artists moved to France in the mid-20th century, maybe Eastern Europeans did the same thing. This work was made in the 1970s and it has that '70s style that even ""The Simpsons"" once mocked. If I were a betting man, I'd say this artist is dead, but I don't want to jinx him if he's alive. His broken English is adorable and may remind many of their foreign-born grandparents. The work starts with him flipping through his photos, but he's just tossing them around on his kitchen table. There is no focus on each one individually, so it almost cheapens his oeuvre. I kinda watched this passively, but I think many will like it."
5,Charles E. Sellier did it again!,"Charles E. Sellier and David W. Balsiger have done a VERY GOOD JOB with this book. They basically proved the existence of Noah's Ark on top of Mt. Ararat. They pretty much disproved the geologic colomn, and also practically disproved the Wyatt-Fasold theory of many arks. Convincing eye-witness accounts confirmed by lie-detector tests and psicological overviews, along with CIA cover-ups and a picture of the ark from the James Irwin expeditions really make this book engrossing. After I read this book, I decided that one day, I would become an ""Arkeologist"" and find that ark!"
1,Biblical Pseudo-Science,"As archeological and other scientific disciplines push the stories of the bible further and further into the realm of mythology and spiritual allegory (where it really belongs, rather than a literal account of events in ancient times), books like these are popular among those desperate to 'hold the line'. They serve as some kind of proof or affirmation that the biblical accounts were based in 'fact'. Frankly, this sensationalistic volume, claiming that a bunch of large rocks on a mountainside 'prove' that Noah's ark actually existed, is just the sort of evidence that a religious person would treat with skepticism and scorn as extremely frail, circumstantial and shabby if used to prove that a biblical event had *not* happened. About as much validity is attached to the author's work as that of Von Daniken."
1,Books like this do NOT do credit. . .,". . .to the cause of Christianity.The frauds surrounding the alleged ""discovery"" of Noah's Ark have been well-documented, and this review is not intended to add to them. Suffice it to say, that from my perspective as a conservative, Christian clergyman, my faith is certainly NOT predicated on being able to ""prove"" the historicity of certain events. For those who require such ""proof"", loss of faith is, sadly, all to often the result when the ""proof"" turns out to be a hoax.Such works can do serious damage -- damage that could and should be avoided."
4,An excellent and still-timely message even nearly 3 decades later!,"Contrary to a previous reviewer (Ray ""History Buff""), Schaeffer never ""took back"" his evangelical views. ""Crazy For God"" was the work of Franky Schaeffer, Francis' son who converted from evangelical Presbyterianism to the Catholic faith. That book is condemned by pretty much everyone who really knew Francis as a hit-piece against his father.But back to the sermon in this video. Hearing (or reading the transcript) today, we can see how right Schaeffer was - with his practically prophetic illustrations. He illustrates in this speech the reality of why our nation has fallen so far. And with the perspective of 27 years of recent history since this address, we can see that all he warned about is fully present in society."
1,"ok baseball game, but hasn't aged well","was ok bad in the day, but so many other baseball games were better. 2 stars."
2,"good for review, but not as up-to-date as it should be","I found the concept of tables and visually organized facts good. However, this book should not be used as single source as many facts are not as current as they should be, e.g. treatment for hyperlipidemia without statins etc.Again, the book does a very good job in organizing key facts such as clinical signs and symptoms. Those are not subject to tremendous change over time.For clinical, especially therapeutic issues, please take care and consult another more ""serious"" review book."
4,"Liquid Silk, a visual lubricant","As a lubricant, it works, it doesn't smell either, but it's not the longest lasting. It is water-based, so you can use it with pretty much any type of toy material out there. And if you like the idea of one that is white in color, this one will do the trick. It is pretty watery though, closer to the natural fluids a body produces, so re-application will be necessary if you dry out."
4,"A bit pricey, still great stuff!","This feels a bit like hair conditioner, but it doesn't irritate like hair conditioner and somehow does not leave a mess behind, so overall I am very satisfied. I will likely be purchasing again when I need more. Very good stuff!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this mobile through a department store with a good return policy so I'm not too upset. The mobile itself looks nice; a variety of brightly-colored animals attached to a yellow plastic frame. It's a little cheap and flimsy but structurally would get the job done. With 2 large ""screws"" it's a pretty solid mount for the crib too. The problem is the wind-up music box/rotating part. When fully wound it plays and rotates for less than 3 minutes; hardly enough to keep any baby occupied.I gave it 2 stars because my little girl seems to like it as long as it spins. If it could go 7-8 minutes between windings it would be a keeper but this one will be getting returned."
3,Less than expected,"I used Aqua di Selva about 25 years ago and it was my ""go to"" fragrance after trying several other products such as Aqua di Parma, Boucheron and Bulgari to name a few. But when it was nearly impossible to find, I used Creed and some of the other brands. Recently I was elated to find it on Amazon.com and purchased it. My disappointment was, that even though the initial spray has a strong woodsy smell, there is a heavy undertone of alcohol. The fragrance lasts at best about three hours, under moderate activities in air conditioned environment. I believe that I received a genuine product and not a diluted fake that seem to permeate the internet. The price cannot be beat but quality control may be lacking. I will continue to occasionally use Aqua di Selva EDC, but it is no longer my main fragrance."

4,A good Addition To Your Collection,"Not too sweet, masculine, and feels Euro. Recommended as a daily use type of scent, or for the less daring perhaps their ""evening out"" scent. Try it."
5,Nice smell and great value,"Give this one a try. It makes a nice aftershave and has a light fresh scent. Eau de Cologne is a classic, look it up."
2,A quick read only.,"Probably a little late with this review, or rather comment. This is an entertaining read, although, to me, obviously based on the Skakel events. One knows practically from the start how this read is going to go. I did find the main character to be somewhat of a whimp, and wonder if this is the way things go among the wealthy. Although Constant is found innocent the author does assure us that the final outcome will not be good for the Bradley family. I would recommend anyone who wants a quick read, on an airplane or something, to pick up this book. I do however think Mr. Dunne could have been less obvious in his retelling of the Skakel affair. There was nothing in this book that we didn't already know, and as you read along you had in your mind what was going to happen next, and it did."
1,A season in purgatory,"I would sum up this potboiler as readable trash !Dominick Dunne obviously worshiped the upper echelons of society, and thinly disguises the real people he wrote about and all the gossip and scandals thatsurround them.He was a skilful writer,and it's a pity that he wasted his talent on the peccadilloes of the vapid super-rich, which are intrinsically boring !I hated myself for reading it and yet couldn't put it down !"
4,Mrs. C.,"Perhaps I've been living under a rock, but I truly didn't know that the book was about Martha Moxley's murder when I started reading it. I figured it out real quick, though. The connections aren't subtle by any means, and that's part of the pleasure of this novel. This is the only Dunne novel I've ever read, and I have to give the guy very high kudos for his no-holds-barred style of tabloid-mentality writing. Reading the novel, I felt like a disgruntled insider in the wealthy Kennedy world . . . It's definitely entertaining and definitely worth a read."
5,Compelling!,"A SEASON IN PURGATORY is consistent with Dominick Dunne's other books. He writes with an easy, readable, style while at the same time he packs his novels with an extraordinary amount of detail.As he often does, Dunne took this story from the headlines, though he obviously had a deep personal connection to the plot about a murdered girl from an exclusive Connecticut town. He never has made a secret of the fact that his own beloved daughter also was murdered. In A SEASON IN PURGATORY, he insisted on telling the tale of the murder of Martha Moxley.Due in large part to Dunne's persistance, Michael Skakel has been tried for that murder and convicted. A SEASON IN PURGATORY was Dunne's early fictionalized effort to refuse to let that murder remain unsolved."
5,The Perfect Piller,"I've been using this piller for two years on a small cat who needs 2-3 pills daily. I tried the ""other"" piller and found it useless. This one seemed large when it first arrived, but its size hasn't been a problem at all. It works beautifully, and I highly recommend it!"
3,It worked for a short time.,Luckily we havent needed to use it since. It does help dispense rx to cat without undue stress for the cat and prevents scratches.
2,Loses effectiveness fast,"Really good when I first opened the pack; however, it seems to lose its effectiveness rather fast, refrigerated or frozen. I will not buy this brand again."
2,Not effective after 3 month,I have only used 25% of it and this yeast merely working already. Too bad.
4,The land of the free,"Only four reviews of this remarkable book (with mine). Strikes me as strange that no other Americans have reacted to it. I suppose that says something. It confirmed for me more than it revealed, but for that I'm also grateful. If it's a premise you can understand and follow, it's a gratifying read."
3,The voice of genius,"The DVD has some great ""home movie"" shots of the master describing some of the highlights. But I was dissappointed by the lack of real insight. I expected more and higher quality production. It does have historic quality but I have seen the same footage mkore effectively produced and incorporated into better media."
2,"Worth renting, but not worth buying","Show content - 3 stars. Value - 1 star. This is a 30 minute black and white documentary made in 1964 which is largely an interview with Steichen and a look at his home and property in Connecticut, along with a few minutes about his wife. Steichen is interesting and has some good insights about his life, his career, his photography and his process. But it's not a documentary about his career and work. A list price of $19.99 is, quite simply, insane for so little content. Kultur Video should put several of these 30 minute shows on a single DVD and then it might be worth a purchase, but I suggest you rent it from NetFlix or see if you can find it at your local library. Your money is better spent buying one of the Steichen books instead."
1,"""This set is not authorized by Neil Young, his management or record label.""","This is absolutely the worst video I have ever purchased. Here is why:The majority, like 99%, of the video is complete nobodies....some obscure person who wrote an article, at best a biographer and a guy or engineered one song in '67. The other 1% of the video are clips...maybe 5 to 10 seconds at a time, of Neil performing commonly available (on you tube) footage. Who wants to see a 5 second clip and then listen to a complete nobody talk for 2 minutes about ""why this song is good?"" There are even more than occasion when these nobodies, in so many words, state that Neil can't sing very well."" Also, there were completely uncalled for and unprofessional statements made by these nobodies such as ""I hate Crosby, Stills and Nash...they are fat choir boys...""Don't waste your money I repeat it states on the box:""This set is not authorized by Neil Young, his management or record label."""
1,absolute waste of money ...,.... unless you collect DVDs for the plastic ... Just a couple of pseudo-experts rambling on as if they have insight into Young's career. Many books available that are far more superior and informative.
1,Crap,"So I got the DVD and popped it into my Macbook pro.It doesn't play.I popped the second DVD in.It doesn't play.Neil, how could you?"
2,SAME OL' G!,"I LOVE MISSY, but T.C. is a rip off of GINUWINE. I hear a couple of songs off the album and he is a sex me up singer with catchy beats. Singing songs just like Ginuwine! He is trying to be just like him and i don't think him nor Missy notice it! I hope he changes his wanna be playa ways before he hits rock bottom! Ohh and Miss, what is up with that wig in the video. It wasn't cute! I like you better with the weave on your album cover. That was hot. Ohh and T.C. ........try not to fit into the mold of other R&B males out there! that is why there is such a low of them and noone buys their cd's!"
5,THE WHITE SHADOW,"I LIKE THE WHITE SHADOW SERIES,IT PORTRAYS AN AUTHORITY FIGURE(COACH REEVES)WHO IS DEDICATED TO HELPING THE MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM WITH THEIR PROBLEMS,IT SHOWS HIS COMPASSION,UNDERSTANDING.IVE WATCHED THIS SHOW ON TELEVISION IN THE PAST AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR VIEWING."
4,sandisk,"it arrived fine and works. i thought it'd be the titanium one, so it was a bit expensive for what it was"
5,"Now, don't be so picky!","All right, ya'll... Quit being so picky! If you don't like the U3 software, just get another drive! Or uninstall it! What is the big deal?? Or ya'll work at CIA and got all this super-duper sensitive information? Why are you using a $30 drive then? You should be spending hundred times more of the taxpayers money!I have used this one for about a month, does all it's suppose to. A lot of room, works fast, works with Mac (ye,ye,ye, it puts another drive on your screen! Big deal!)I even like some of the U3 programs, the anti virus is actually handy - you can check your system independently from your computer!Over all it is a great device. I have used many SanDisk products, they never failed me."
2,To pricey,The drive I bought was through Amazon's site but from another vendor. The shipping was way to high and much better deals can be gotten elsewhere. The shipping was a bit on the shadey side how it was doen as well. I would look at other vendors for much better deals on usb flash drives.
4,I finally have 4G of memory in my pocket!,"I love this item, but I get annoyed by the U3 software. I haven't use this item but once, so I haven't taken the time to uninstall the U3 software, so don't let that turn you away. I've heard its a sinch to remove."
1,Not for Mac,"This item comes with U3 stuff imbedded, which is useless to Mac users. It is not possible to throw away the U3, which shows up as a separate disk icon on the desktop. You also cannot reformat this ""disk."" It takes up 200 MG that one loses as storage space, and puts two icons on the desktop. This disk is simply not satisfactory for a Mac user unless you want to put up with lost space and useless icons on the desktop."
1,worthless,"Couldn't get it to format correctly either for normal PC use or with an Xbox 360. It was cheap, and I guess I got what I paid for."
1,I hate using this thing,"Does the drive do what it is supposed to? Yes, but beyond that its a piece of crap. The design is flimsy and cheap. It doesn't lock into place once extended so its constantly disconnecting from whatever device its plugged into. The bright orange light it emits is just annoying."
4,Great Product,I like my new flash drive. I got it the first day it was estimated to arrive and I have already started to use it. It was very fast for the computer to install the necessary drivers.
3,Good product overall.,"Good flash drive itself. The only thing that bothers me sometimes is that the light never turns off. Other than that, it works very well."
4,Sandisk Cruzer Flash drive,"Everything is good about this sliding idea except I would like a locking pin or even just more friction on the sliding piece. It's a little loose, I think."
5,"Reliable for 3 years and counting, still looks great","I got this flash drive in the summer of 2007 (4 GB was really hot stuff back then!) and I've never had any problems with it. I like that it's small, has a place for a key ring, the USB connector retracts so it won't get damaged, and the black color makes it look very sharp. The orange indicator light is very bright and a little obnoxious, but I love everything else about this drive. I've used it in my computer, friends' computers, computer labs, and more from Windows XP to 7, and have always been able to read it. Just remove the annoying U3 software (it didn't put up much of a fight, if I remember correctly) and storing and transporting your files is fast and easy."
3,"Great product, not great shipping","I was very pleased with the flash drive. It holds plenty for our organization's needs and I like that I don't have to worry about keeping up with a cover. I was not pleased with having to pay postage due for the shipment. Beach Camera's response to my email regarding same was essentially, ""Sorry about that."" I doubt I will use this supplier again."
5,WORKS GREAT,"This is the perfect thing for school, home, office and anything you can think of its perfect and i haven't had any problems with it."
3,"Good drive, but not Ready Boost",This is a good drive from SanDisk. The U3 is annoying. Just format the drive and remove it. And this disk does not work with Ready Boost for Vista like what the product description says.
3,Company is a BIG disappointment!,"I own several SanDisk USB drives. All have worked flawlessly and I would give them 5 stars BUT the company has some terrible gaps in service. Mediocre support, but that's fairly common among companies. My big problem came with my third and fourth orders. So I warn you, order something from their online store listed ""in stock"" and you may find your product is really on back order, and THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT WILL SHIP. I had this happen twice. They couldn't even say that it would probably ship within a month, or even 6 months! They are polite and honest and totally useless for anyone needing to rely on receiving what they ordered."
3,Great Jump drive but not VISTA compatable,Great product if you are not using VISTA. U3 Software in NOT VISTA compatable and SanDisk cannot tell me when the update will be available. Can't find a way to change the password once set. Working on it. Any upgrades to the U3 system formats the unit.
1,Installs stuff you don't want or need,"I'm a software developer who uses (well, used) this drive to transfer files between my mac and pc. Starting today, I'm no longer going to use this drive or any that Sandisk makes. Their auto-run software is annoying, and there is no way to remove it permanently as far as I can tell. The thing launches 2 drives when you plug it into windows XP... one for your stuff which is pre-cluttered with sandisk junk, and one for their auto-run software. Even when you try to delete their files, it comes back next time you insert the drive. You can disable the auto-run software temporarily, but this morning I ran a windows XP update, and behold, their autorun stuff is back, bothering me with popups and wasting my system resources. Get a clue, Sandisk. People want a drive for their data, not yours."
3,U3 work is not reliable,"As USB Flash Cruzer works fine. But its U3 applications are not very reliable. For, example, EverNote (Microsoft Office OneNote like program) sometimes lunches, sometimes doesn't. Seems to be, it has mind of its own to decide when to work and when don't. May be reason for it that I have Vista. Who knows? With Microsoft you never know what is compatible and what isn't. But game Atlantis works fine. (Big relief :) And its plastic body seems fragile. If you want Cruzer better buy titanium version."
2,it is sooooo slow!!!,"I have this for a long time...I have already written review but I have to do new one, because the cruizer is so slow... and that freaks me out.Everything is just too slow.shame :("
1,Use at your own risk!,"SanDisk 2 GB Cruzer Micro USB Flash Drive with U3 (SDCZ6-2048-A11)This product automatically installs LOCKED software into every computer you use it in. I am a teacher and this software fouled the hard drive and made it more difficult time consuming, and sometimes, impossible to use other flash drives in every classroom I used it in. I have had it two weeks and I have tossed it in the garbage.I have used other broads for years on dozes of computers with zero problems. This one spoiled four or five of my classes before I finally said, enough!"
3,cheap storage but cheap housing,I've had other flash drives like this and this one works fine but I was disappointed to find how cheaply made the casing is. Of course that's not apparent in an on line image. On the plus side the USB jack is recessed which is good as there is no cover to misplace. Nothing wrong with the drive's function but my bet is there are other flash drives out there at a similar price.
2,"It has a nice feature, but is too flimsy!","I have owned many USB drives including this one. When compared to the similarly priced and rugged Corsair drives, the Sandisk seems very cheaply made to me. They can easily break off of the neck lanyard and are a little too small for their own good. The only thing I like about this drive is that there is no cap to lose. My advice is to consider the Corsair USB drives, or maybe even the Kingston drives, before buying this one."
5,Great product,"Product works great! Computer read the flash drive, I saved stuff on it. No problem. Love that I can push the drive in its shell to protect it. A cover would be nice but otherwise great product for the price."
2,time bomb,"Poor endurance.Mine died in 1 year.I took care of this drive really well. Also I have one other extremely cheap kingston flash drive, which is kicked every single day, and though it looks like a toy and performs really bad, at least, it still works."
2,Erratic,"I had problems with this item since receiving it. The computer sometimes simply does not recognize it, and even worse, on ocassions this happened while working on some files, causing the loss of data and hours of work. I disabled the U3 feature, and that might something to do with the problem."
3,"Works fine, a little slow","Can run a little slow at times if you're trying to run programs off of it. Couldn't get the U2 software to work on it, so I just deleted it."
3,Took effort to work in Vista,"Initially couldn't get this drive to work in Vista. I have the 2gb version which worked fine, but the 4gb wouldn't work. I called tech support and they said wait for a vista driver. Eventually I downloaded a hotfix from Microsoft. Now it works. Frustrating as hell though. I was close to bringing it back.If you're stuck like I was, try this:Right click on ""Computer"" and select Manage.Then choose Device Managerif you see a u3 Cruzer drive listed with a yellow icon on it, right click and select uninstall, then stick the drive back in the computer, go through the windows installation wizard. It will fail to find a driver, then there should be an option for windows to find a solution, follow that, a website should open with a link, follow that. I wish I could be more help but I clicked through all this too fast and I can't find the page anymore. Good luck."
2,Good while it lasted...,"This product lasted eight months, and then no computer could read it. One day, I heard a hiccup when I pushed the latch that slides out the USB connection, and that was the end. I would recommend that you opt for a flash drive without manually-driven, moving parts."
5,"A versatile, reliable secure flash drive","The 4 GB Cruzer is ideal for my purposes. Plenty of storage capacity plus it has optional password protection. But don't lose the password or else the entire contents of the drive must be erased to restore access.A useful program that came with the Cruzer (Signup Shield Passwords) allows me to store user names, passwords and so forth. The pertinent info is then entered automatically when signing in to a particular website. The first 9-10 entries are free, and for a subscription fee of around $25 the program will store virtually all of one's passwords."
1,"Currently, this product sucks","Not only is it not compatible with Windows Vista, it *HANGS* my windows vista machine (most recent udpates).I loaded the Cruzer micro into my Windows XP SP2 machine, and updated it from the Sandisk site.Still hangs my Vista machine. Can't eject it, can't shut down the machine.Have to hold the power button down for five seconds to shut off the machine...Chris"
3,Haven't used it yet.....,"I haven't actually stored anything on the product yet, but it seems to be just as advertised. I'll update the review when I do use it."
4,Almost perfect,"Everything works great. Good transfer speed, durable so far, and compact. One complaint though is that my old 2 GB version of this flash drive has a more solid sliding mechanism than this one. Besides that everything is awesome, and the one drawback is not noticeable unless you have something to compare it to side by side."
3,4G Flash Drive,"I had this drive for one year. I liked it and had no problems with it until it quit working for me. I used it on Mac OS, XP and my Vista."
4,Awesome,The 4GB Cruzor by Sandisk is excellent! It gives you the ability to secure the contents of the entire drive with one password. Now I don't have to fumble through setting password after password to protect data.
1,This drive is TRASH! Died in less than 3 months!!!,"I bought this drive because so many of the reviews on amazon.com were favorable. However, I've only had my cruzer drive for about 3-4 months and it is no longer working. One day I was using the drive and the computer stopped recognizing it and it stopped flashing. I initially thought it might be a computer issue and i switched computers but no luck. I've taken very good care of this drive so you can imagine my disappointment that it died in MONTHS! Save your money and buy a product that actually works."
5,SanDisk Micro 4 Gig USB Flash Drive thumbs up!,The flash drive has worked great. The best part is that the male end of the connection is retractable which makes it much more durable.I don't like all of the spyware programming as you have to click through the No-I-don't-want-to-install-it everytime you plug it into a new PC (not a problem with Macs and the programs aren't compatible.)
5,Worked great!,"The flash drive arrived in good condition and I was able to copy the files I needed. Probably more space than needed for my home computer, but I was satisfied with my purchase."
4,Good USB drive. Lasted four years.,"I have had this drive for slightly more than four years. It has been working very well until recently it gets very hot when plugged and later gets disconnected, especially when I'm copying large amount (>500MB) of data. I also had 3 out of about 500 picture files corrupted while storing in it. Anyway, four years of service is not bad at all."
1,NOT Password-Protected,"I should have read negative reviews for this item before I decided to order it. As other reviewers have already stated: this memory stick doesn't have U3 software installed on it anymore, therefore you get NO password protection - this is just your regular 4 GB flash drive. I will try to install free USB Secure software on it and see if it works. If it doesn't, I will consider returning this item. Not happy at all."
2,Not for carrying in pocket,"I'm work for an insurance agency in the IT Department and bought this drive soon after graduating. It lasted for 3-4 years in my pocket, but then stopped registering on any computer I plugged it into. I'm guessing the connectors eventually wiggled loose. I did use it pretty constantly during those 3 years, but I'd like a drive that lasts a bit longer. Luckily I did weekly backups of the data that was on the drive, so I didn't lose much. If you're going to use the San disk drives, I recommend removing the U3 product as soon as you get it. There are other products that will serve the same purpose and won't install on your computer or erase your data. [...] is one that I use on a daily basis.Form factor is ok at best. When plugging the drive into the machine, make sure your fingers are on the side. If you accidentally press the button while inserting the drive will just slide back into the casing. A slight annoyance, but not what you want when time is key."
2,"Worked great, until it SUDDENLY DIED in under a year","Yes. You can remove the nasty bloatware. But when it works fine in the evening, and then suddenly doesn't in the morning? Inexplicably. Suddenly. Just stops working, after 10 months of working perfectly?And all SanDisk does is confirm it's the drive with a verbal shrug, and gives no explanation, let alone any data recovery options."
4,I think results may vary...for some reason. Overall good buy.,"Well I bought this as part of a Secret Santa present I had with some friends. She doesn't like anything where she has to jump through all these hoops just to get something to work, but this USB flash drive is simple, plug in, let it automatically install itself and boom drag and drop. I read some reviews of it not being Vista compatible, but even though it doesn't say it on the back of the package it worked fine with my friends Vista Ultimate equipped Compaq laptop. So even though I don't own it and use it enough to review this in full confidence as long as my friend was satisfied then so was I."
2,Flimsy construction,"Good: It works. You can, at least on mine, reformat the drive to remove the U3 junk.Bad: It has a plastic case that sounds like it's going to break when you handle it.The USB connector tends to slid back into the case when you try to insert it into your computer. The flimsy construction makes you afraid to grip it tightly to prevent the connector from sliding back in. This means you have to play with it when you insert it into the USB slot on the computer to get it to work.I have had numerous products from this company with no complaints till now."
5,Works like it should,"With the on the go life style the U3 launchpad was made for those needing a quick way to boot up the files they needed from any windows computer. However in most cases the software is slow and I needed this for storage more than to tote around programs, which I now do from [...]. All I had to do to remove U3 from the drive was to go to the sandisk website, look for the uninstall app, plug my drive in and presto it was gone. Took less than a min as it has done for most of us who found this out. The fact that it doesn't have a cap to lose and it's space saving design also appealed to me. There was even a little ring for me to put it on my lanyard. Good amount of storage space for my art file formats and other files that I need through out the day. I gave it 5 stars for being friendly enough to get rid of U3 and do what it was made to do. Store things."
5,great!,"this product is great and i can definitely rely on it! and good timing for it too now that my computer completely crashed and now i have to reformat it. i'm so glad i had this in time so now all of my work and pictures are safe.i love how it retracts so i don't have to worry about losing a cap to protect it and it glows an orange-ish color when it's plugged in, the light turns off when it's not connected and it blinks a few times while it's saving or being busy. there is some program on it called U3, but i immediately got rid of it because i knew it wouldn't benefit me in any way and was taking a little space. so now it is just a storage device for all of my pictures and school work.i don't think i will be able to survive college without it! but be warned, it's not a full 4 gig! it's more like 3.73 gigs!"
3,"not bad, but not impressive either","Too much in the way of software. I just need a simple way to back up files, not have it make my breakfast for me."
1,"Frustrations, Freezes, Reboots, and Pain","All of the folks complaining of system freezes and reboots when using this drive are true. It seems to be erratic though so some users have no issues. I have 4 PC's and 2 Mac's in the house. This drive works fine on both mac's and 1 of the PC's. The other 3 PC's barf when the drive is inserted and just reboot themselves. It's the U3 software that causes the problems. I have several other flash drives and they all work fine on all machines. Risk it if you want, but there are better, cheaper, faster drives that won't give you headaches like this one. Sandisk just lost a customer and is now on my list of companies that owe me a few hours of my life back."
1,Watch out for the bloatware,"The first time I plugged my new Cruzer drive, I discovered to my dismay that it automatically uploaded unexpected, unannounced and unwanted programs into my computer. Moreover, these proved nearly impossible to eradicate, not only from my computer but from the flash drive. Even reformatting the Cruzer wouldn't remove them. This is inexcusable. I've purchased many Sandisk products in the past, but I never will again. Obviously they can no longer be trusted.I threw away the drive."
2,Don't get this unless you REALLY want the U3!,"I've had no problems with reliability or anything like that, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1. The problem is that I use a Mac, and the U3 system is useless on Macs. It is also not removable, even by reformatting the drive. It's very annoying that when I plug it into a computer it automatically tries to pretend that there's a CD there, and Windows computers sometimes give pop-up messages about it. I thought I could use this drive as a plain-old flash drive, but the fact that the U3 feature cannot be turned off or removed is an enormous pain. I'm probably going to buy a different one, and I would recommend against buying this drive, at least until SanDisk makes it possible to remove the U3 system."
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"This is a good little flash drive. It holds your files and (for me) has not yet had an error after a year of use. This best feature I've found on it is the readyboost option is has for some computers. I can plug it in and use it as extra RAM to speed up my computer. Cool product, especially for the price."
4,SanDisk Cruzer Micro 4 GB,This flash drive is fine. It came on time and is exactly the same as another one I have. Nice and portable.
4,Highly Practical,"I purchased this book to replace a copy that I purchased earlier and ""loaned"" to someone. The author's method is highly practical and straightforward. I would have liked the author to consider and explain other options and let me make some choices. He seems to be a strong advocate mainly for his chosen techniques."
1,Never received item,"I ordered this this book (Cubed Food Gardening) along with two others, more than a month ago. The other two came within a week, but I've yet to receive this item."
3,Ok for general info,"Was very disappointed; expected much more. Bird is not just ""short"" on organics he has an anti-organic stance. ""If you stick to organics, you must be willing to share...your crop with...less than appetizing produce. Most of us are not so willing."" (p. 8)Really? Au contraire, a high proportion of us who do want to grow our veggies want exactly that - pesticide-free, organic food that is safe and nutritious to eat. It's not that hard. Bird only has 2 simple diagrams for plot layout; more specific diagramming would be helpful to readers. (other writers can do it, why not him?) Save your money, don't buy this as a first book for bio-intensive raised bed vegetable gardening. I will be getting Bartholomew's Square Foot Gardening - when I do, I will rate it here. To be fair, there are good planting and frost date charts, but this is not enough."
1,Puts Dog Crap in garden beds,"He uses fresh dog manure, in compost, and then puts it in garden beds. Has apparently never heard of the word ""parasite"". Revolting, unsanitary, and could kill you.Brags about giving root veggies to friends, have to wonder if they know about the ""fertilizer""."
2,Stick to Square Foot Gardening Bks,"This book is not worth the money wanted. The same ideas, just better, are in the Square-Foot Gardening series of bks. I should have got this out of the library first but no library had it around me. I guess it would be ok if you're really just starting out reading about this type of gardening."
3,We don't know yet...,"But, we are certainly going to enjoy finding out how good this book really is.The explanations are clear and we are already planning the crops we will have in the four beds we intend to make according to the instructions.We are going to retire to Kunming, in the South-western Chinese province of Yunnan. The weather is sort of Mediterranean, except we are about 2000 m above sea level. Old rich red volcanic soil.We should be happy. Keep tabs, we'll post our progress for you to see."
5,Hard to find but worth the effort,"This movie has everything a 50s SciFi classic should have: flying saucers, scary aliens, campy but decent special effects, romance, suspense, comedy, and maligned main characters who ultimately prevail--in this case 20-something actors passed off as misunderstood teenagers. The plot is sparse in places but it moves along and has some entertaining subplots.Invasion of the Saucer Men is among the best 50s SciFi flicks. Too bad it's not available on DVD."
3,Depressing,"I've read the first two books in this series. I read novels for the m/m. There is not enough fag romance in this story to satisfy that. This series is a tragedy bordering on horror fiction. If you are into evil winning the day instead of good, this is for you. I hated it. The books are suspenseful, though, so if you start reading you will not be able to stop. You were warned. The novels put me in mind of the anime series Beserk - if you've seen that you'll know what you're in for.My personal book reviews are at jemcrystaline.livejournal.com"
2,Not chosen by me,"I was seduced by the cover art and blurb to start reading vol. I of this series. Having gotten two thirds through volume one I had to stop reading, overwhelmed by the images of bloodshed and torture. I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for over 40 years now and have often encountered the theme of the young man, naive and moral, who is thrust into a decadent society. Observing the often exotic customs of such a society is often as much fun as watching as the hero learns through suffering how to deal with and often overthrow this corrupt society. However, in this work the descriptions of wholesale killings, blindings and crucifixions in time overwhelm any interest that the plot might hold. One has the sense from these detailed descriptions that the author is overly fascinated by the sadistic elements of this tale to the detriment of the story he is attempting to tell."
5,"""Gay"" is a relative word.","Some of the reviewers here have objections to the fact that Carnelian, the main character, seems to be ""gay"". I think such a view is a total misinterpretation. In the world described in this magnificent novel, there are no such concepts as ""gay"" and ""straight"". None of the characters in the novel sees anything ""wrong"" with the love affair, and nobody is the least surprised. It is also strongly hinted, that Carnelian's father, when young, had exactly the same type of love affair with the God-Emperor himself, and this this was basically the reason for his self-imposed exile. The people in this world simply do not view sexuality in the same manner as people in our world. And perhaps the author has some further susprises up his sleeve? I, for one, hope so!"
5,"The Chosen (Stone Dance of the Chameleon Trilogy, Bk 1)","This book was great. I had to read every word. And I couldn't put it down. Great descriptions, and characters. Great writing! And after that ending, all I can say is, WHEN DOES THE NEXT BOOK APPEAR.I MUST HAVE IT! I MUST READ IT! I MUST!"
2,The editor slipped up,"The basic story line is quite interesting. The characters have depth and complex relationships. The plot is a little predictable, but it is interesting.The pace of the story is excruciatingly slow, with a great deal of unneccssary detail and repitition of the same stuff every 4-5 pages.A good editor is supposed to help identify these types of wrinkles and smooth them out. The author is on the right track, but this edition is 100 pages too long for the story it tells.There's nothing wrong with having the extra 100 pages, it's just a good idea to write them in a manner that keeps the reader driving to the next page instead of dragging into it,"
2,Slow is an understatement,This book has some new ideas and interesting characters. That is why is is so sad that the story is so dull. Stay away from this book unless you are a masochist or need help falling asleep.
3,Interesting but... Boring.,"There is nothing that I can add about the book that wasn't already written here, except that the book is boring.The author just likes to keep describing and describing and describing with no story advancement. But what is worse is that he just exagerates! It's really annoying! Too many short sentences in a row. Too many descriptions. And even the way he describes is not very appealing... Because it's too much!I really wanted to love this book, but for the first time in my life, i was very tempted to skip pages or even not finish the book.If you like something like this: a man is walking toward his home, which is 20 meters away. The author would describes his clothes, the way he walks, how the sky is beatiful and how beatiful is the sky. Then he would describe his house from afar, its garden and even a small snail in a plant, a described plant, off course. Then the man would take a step. Wow. Let's describe all again!Yep... That's it."
1,<<hack>>,"This was recommended to me because I told someone I liked Tolkein, Martin, Jordan and Williams. I wish I had used the cash on something far more satisfying, like paying some mobster to pull my fingernails off with plyers. Wretched!"
2,Be forwarned: this is not a PC review,"The basic story and character development are good - Pinto has a style all of his own and is a good wordsmith.Unlike other reviewers, I found the entire portrayal of human life as base and the level of subservience as warped, and akin to the Norman/Gor stuff. I confess to having liked the Gor series when I was in High School, but I was too young to know D&S when I saw it. Also unfortunate (for me) is that while Norman's characters have a hetero worldview, Pinto's main character is gay.I don't consider myself a homophobe, but this perspective does nothing for me. On the whole I found the book disturbing and will not purchase any further works by the author. PS: I would not buy any Norman books either..."
4,"Oh, well...","The photos are great, and there was just a little information about the ""real-life Waltons"", but unfortunately the vast majority of the book is taken up with episode summaries. Not really what I was looking for, but it is valuable for a Waltons fan."
5,Good Night John Boy,I really think people should read this book. If you are a TRUE Waltons fan like myself; you will enjoy it over and over again. It is what a family did to survive the depression times. I sometimes wish I lived back in that time with the Hamner family because they knew what life was all about and clung to their beliefs as a family. Family is the most important part in life and we shouldn't take them for granted.
4,The Waltons,"I enjoyed this book so much.I have all seasons of The Waltons and watched them over the years.It was so good to read of all the people who protrayed this large family and what they are doing in life after the program ended.I am sending it off to my older brother to read,he also has all the dvds. I have been on line for other books involving The WaltonsLillian"
4,Good night John-Boy,This is a very good book and gives additional insight into Mr. Hammer and his family and the characters he brought to life. I wish there had been extra written about all the episodes but the ones written were good.
3,Difficult installation,"I did not realize that the actual pole was in 3 separate pieces. Although the instructions looked simple, they actually were quite confusing. There are a lot of pieces to this. But the final result is good. I am pleased with how it operates and its durability so far."
1,Poor Description,Very poor description. I thought I was receiving an entire system not just a pole!! Not happy at all!!!
5,BakFlip G2,This is just what I wanted. Can use the full bed in a heart beat or if items are not to tall hide them and they are locked up. If you have a locking tailgate. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a bed cover.
1,very poor performance for the money,Purchased a cover in 2007 when I bought a new truck. The FIRST cover had abrasions along the rubber gasket. as this was only cosmetic I let it go. Within the year all taped joint started to come off (still cosmetic). I returned it to the place of purchase and it was replaced. The new one did exactly the same thing within a few months. They refused to replace it again. I have lived with it until a year ago and I then noticed the black vinyl which covers each panel had cracked in numerous places. I have attempted to re glue this with little success. A $1000 cover is now garbage! BUYER BEWARE !!!
1,"Nice, but leaks and is a dust vacuum","I read all the reviews and thought this would be perfect. But first off the thing leaks like crazy, leaks on all four corners and in the middle seams.Then because I live on a dirt road I thought it would keep the dust off things, no such luck. This is like a dust vacuum...it actually sucks the dust into the bed from the outside. If you have the plastic bed rail covers it is even worse. The dust comes in under the bed caps. So I have to silicone under there too. I have plugged every hole I can find and still no luck...tons of dust.I really like the fold up portion but I am really disappointed that this thing leaks and sucks in the dust.So considering that the only thing it works well doing is to keep people from stealing things...but awfully expensive just to do that.Good luck..."
2,Leaks,"Leaks a lot , put your thing in garbage bags to keep dry!have adjusted several times!still leaks on sides and from corners"
2,2007 F150 HARLEY DAVIDSON AWD,"not what I was hoping for I had to hack up my factory bedliner and scratched my truck moving the rails in and out to cut the liner. You have to open the cover to close the tailgate. stickers and tape all over that leaves alot of residue after you peel them off I don't want to scrape it off for fear of scratching the cover. When I close it the gasket on the outside edge and tail gate folds under and I have to pull it out, but at the hinges it is bent up the other way and it doesn't look like it will seal hopefully it will straighten out over time. If you don't cut all the bed liner on the back of the bed the tailgate won't close (you have cut the side back top corners of the bed liner to). I should have stuck with soft cover but once you start cutting there is no going back."
3,Very different..,"A bit dusty, but other than that it came in very quickly and works great.The only problem is its much different than what was pictured here, the description is very wrong instead of a ""CrossFire 512MB GDDR4 x1950"" it was a 256mb gddr3 and no crossfire at all. Still it was very cheap."
3,Remington honors warranty,"Good, compact hair dryer at a reasonable price. Small size works especially well and the 2 fan speeds and 3 heat settings make it very versatile. Had the dryer a little over 1 year when the fan disintigrated. This is the problem noted in several other reviews. The product has a 2 year warranty so I sent Remington customer service an email and asked about warranty service. They responded the same day and all I had to do was send them a letter describing the problem and include the original receipt. No shipping/handling charge and didn't have to return the broken dryer. Received a replacement via UPS in less than a week. That kind of customer service is hard to find these days."
4,"Love it, but it isn't for long-term.",I have purchased 6 of these dryers in the past few years. Why???? I love the small compact size of the dryer and the power. But... it does tend to do the internal combustion thing that was mentioned in one other review. Parts inside must break and get into the fan which causes sparks and smoke and terrible noise. That is why I buy them 2 at a time. I just consider it a temporary item and am willing to replace it as long as I can find them for $10 - $15.00.
1,Junk!,"I've bought two of these and they both broke the same way. I bought one about a year ago and it died last months. It didn't make any sound or smoke or anything, it simply stopped working sometime in the night and wouldn't turn on. I bought a new one of the same (dumb choice, I know) a MONTH ago, and it breaks today! Just won't turn on! Don't buy these things, they're not going to last."
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!,I purchased this item today at target...for the same price as listed here. I was soo excited because it looked nice that I came right home to try it. I pluged it into the wall and turned it on for the first time....smoke...BLACK SMOKE...and lots of it! This product is defective! BUYERS BEWARE!!!
1,"Danger! Danger! Warning, Will Robinson!","I've had this hair dryer for less than a year, choosing it because it looked like something from The Jetsons, was a great price, and was a good brand name. Today it suddenly started making a strange sound and I could smell burning plastic. I also heard something rattling around in the thing, and realized that if I didn't turn it off, bits of whatever had come loose would start shooting out at me. I have NEVER had a hair dryer break after such a short time! They usually last more than five years. This hair dryer may look cute, but it is VERY poor quality."
1,Be Careful!!!,I had this dryer for about 8 months when I used it one day it just broke from inside it was scary if I were you I wouldn't use this get a new dryer before it happens.
1,"slightly better then the other older Madden games, but still aged horribly",just not very fun. play new sports games everything is updated more realistic and fun. 1 star.
3,Not his best work.,"An enjoyable and quick read, but the post-Cold War theme doesn't really measure up to the tension and feel of his earlier novels."
3,Just an okay chair!,"I bought this chair based on the looks in the picture, and the description sounded nice.I recieved it fast and put it together. One screw was bad so i ran to the hardware and got a replacement. When the chair is fully put together it is not comfortable.The back is extremely straight up and down and feels like you are being pushed forward in the chair.The material is stiff not soft and does not have alot of cusion to the seat. I will probably keep it because it's all together now and don't want to bother with the hassle of a return.I was just hoping for a little nicer!"
4,Nice chair,"So far no issues. As comfortable as I thought it would be. Took a little bit of time to ship, but hey, I've never purchased anyhting like this from Amazon before. Overall nice purchase."
3,To recieve and give away,"In this story a boy named Hugh Thomas thinks his father and friend were playing about weired things happening on the Bauyou Clapateaux. But soon as Hugh went to the Bauyou it was horrible. The trip started out alright after cathching a bundle of fish. But soon as he was threatend by a gator for taking his fish , harrased by a racoon, and robed by a cat. Hugh ended up with three fish, for himself, his father, and friend."
5,There's No One Better,"If you are a ""Doris Fan"" you definitely need to buy this set of CD's. No matter how many years pass, nor how many new performers come along, no one sings a song like Doris Day. It is no wonder after all these years, there are still new fans being born to her music each day. Such a talent,...such a voice.And for those who have never heard her sing, this is a good way to get started. I loved every song.Karen SeverinoAlbuquerque, New Mexico"
5,The Best of Doris,This CD is absolutely fabulous. I totally enjoyed it. It is a MUST for any true Doris Day fan! Get your copy now so you can also enjoy. You won't be sorry!
3,Decent Dance Song,"The Ocean Mix of this song is by far the best, with a decidedly euro sound, a little downtempo like Real McCoy's ""Another Night"". It takes a little warming up to, but once you get into it, it won't let you go. The Z.E.N. Euro Edit gives the song more of a harder euro edge, which comes out well, but it loses a little something in the translation. The Ocean Mix is better. The two Santana mixes are great for club play, but the average listener will skip right over these. The unplugged mix is not really unplugged, but turns it into an uptempo ballad. Definitely a club song to pick up."
4,Catchy With Nice Singing,"Where did this girl come from? She has a full, rich voice that's a notch or two above your usual wailing dance diva. The Richie Santana Love Mix is my favorite--a peak-time dancefloor quaker that builds beautifully out of ethereal, looping vocals. Kind of a Johnny Vicious sound. The other mixes have a cheesy Euro vibe. It's the Santana mixes that'll bring attention to this debut."
5,Fellow Musician,"At a local gig (IGORS in Montgomery, Alabama) a few days ago I had the opportunity to meet one of the principal musicians of thes ensemble. Having had the opportunity to listen to, talk with and observe Karey on keys have given me a personal new high to reach for. These tracks (all of them), are in the pocket. The beat and clarity in transitions, structure and mix on the original tracks are magnificent. A new and different twist on Miles' Jo Jo is refreshing yet these reflect too the respect for the original peaks and valleys miles intended. I have truly enjoyed the CD and would suggest to all to GET THIS ONE!!!"
4,Reaching Your Dream,"It has been over 15 years since I first read this book. I recently re-read it and am very impressed at how well it has stood up, even though it's pre-Internet. The principles of evangelism are still good reminders about how to get things done. Kawasaki's book is a fun, fast, and instructive read."
1,BLA BLA BLA BLA (Eat like Bird and Poo like and Elephant),"The most STUPID Book ever written ..this guy is a CON Artist ! he use Apple over and over and over and over ...and when he is himself he write stupid things like ..Eat like a bird and poo like and elephant.. I read this quote in the office and every one was like ..really ...this guy is SICK ,,MALADE !!"
3,A real Circus,"Many reviews of this program have been very good but I wonder how many people have really worked with this program. I have been a Mac user since the first Apple II computer and through the years I have installed hundreds of programs. I have significant and stil unsolved problems with the installation and the company does not seem interested in even answering my pleas for help.The manual which can be printed from the internet is very, very poorly written and organized. I do believe some answer are there but it takes many hours to find them. In addition the program uses very strange nomenclature such as cell which is really the equivalent of paragraph.If one can make the program work it will be a very useful program but the company needs to do a lot of work in customer support and re-writing the manual.W. H. van Houten, MD, PhD."
1,Looks and feels cheap,We ordered a Jersey which was priced pretty high ($86) expecting a high quality item. What we got was cheap material with silk screen that was also poor. For the cost I was expecting sewn on embroidered patches and player name. We returned it and to the sellers credit had no problem with the return.
2,"I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did...","But I didn't. I just kept praying it would spead up as it went on. The story never improved, the pace was too slow and the writting uncaptivating."
4,good game,This game will make you want to stop being a steve francis fan! It got good graphics but not what we will see in two or three years with the x-box or the ps2 but it has the players that you want and fun for hours
1,Not-so-cold paks,"I wrap cold packs around my wrists and arms for chronic tendinitis. From the positive reviews I saw, I was hopeful I could replicate my experience with old-fashioned drugstore cold packs, which I cannot find anymore. However, these cold-paks are too thin to hold their temperature for more than 5 minutes and even in those 5 minutes, I can barely feel them when wrapped with a thin dish towel. They are simply not robust enough to do any good."
3,A gem from the dying days of the hair metal era..,"I found a second hand Casssette of this album in a new and used music store. My hobby is collecting Christian rock and metal. Considereing the era, being the tail end of the hair band era, it is a good album. To me most of the songs are more straight ahead rock, than metal. THey weren't muscially all that original, and sounded like thousands of other bands during that era. Although I didn't let that stop me from enjoying it from start to finish. It eventually ended upbeing filed away in th rest of my music library but I'm proud to have it in my collection."
4,Great fragrance,My niece used this perfume when I was at her house a few weeks ago and I thought it smelled wonderful. I'd describe it as lemony. Beautiful bottle. I knew that it was hard to find but I knew I'd find it here. I'm very happy with the fragrance but the only downside is that it doesn't last too long. It's a great way to leave the house in the morning though! Very fresh-smelling.
1,don't buy,i received this item yesterday and gave it to my girlfriend today to find out it was a dummy. DON'T BUYYYYYY!!! Thankfully they're gonna refund my money back.
5,Wow.. Great price and so easy to install,This is a fiasco genuine OE replacement Lennox part and is an exact replacement for the part in my Lennox furnace. I had it in four days and all is good in the world of heating once more. And the HVAC contractors want crazy money for this thing!
5,Comprehensive handbook for management,"The perfect book for the people that are managing the call centers. Especially when call center is just a part of your responsibility and you need a comprehensive and ehhaustive in-depth description of call center activities. Great book. Good for both excecutives to understand what the call center managers are doing (even in terms of languages they speak, very usefull, if you are not able to undestand sometimes the cc managers you need the book) and call centers managers in order to understand how to present their work to the executives."
5,Very Goos Spanish Translation!,"The Spanish edition is one of the few books that can be found about the ""Call Center Managment Universe"".Besides that, it gave me a really good vision about what a Call or Contact Center should be.Really enjoyable......"
5,A real Focus on Call Center's Opeartional Dynamics,"CCM on FFwd do represent a down to earth challenges and objectives of the the operational aspect for any focused or unfocused Call Center. To read, understand and implement the book ideas, you have to be a thorough professional in order to align it with the real world. Cleveland showed his work of art which makes us eager to see his next ""Stop"" after ""Fast Forward""."
2,bullseye pillgun,"Bought it, dumped it. Maybe it works on other cats, not on my little psychos. I bought it to make the task of serving their medicine easier. They saw the gun and they went WOOOOOHAaaW."
1,Still not shipped!,Ordered on 8/26/10 now 9/1/10 and still not shipped. Ordered other items from other places at same time and have recieved them. If it is not in stock then that should be posted. Will not look to do business again.
2,Not for small pills,I chose this for use with a cat. The pills have been cut in half and this tube was too big to handle the pill. Not to be used with any small pills. You would have to have Horse pills with this pill dispenser.
3,Pill gun,"flimsy, but medicating a cat is a formidable job at best. If I had it to do over again, I probably would not buy it"
5,Excellent,"Wonderful way to give your cat a daily pill. Just wrap a towel around the cat, open the mouth, and pop the pill down into the throat. If they bite, they don't get your fingers, just the ""pillgun"", and that is soft enough for them to bite but not do damage to it. Though I would not reccomend this for very small pills."
1,Season 3 PART 1???,"Just release season 3 and 4 together complete!! I was pretty happy with Shout Factory's first Angry Beavers release with season 1 & 2 together, even though they didn't put any special features on the discs. But please release Seasons 3 & 4 all together as one to complete the set. I really don't want to have to buy FOUR more sets to complete the collection."
5,Amazing,"I love Pete Sampras since he retired, tennis is not the same except maybe a little bit RN. The DVD is wonderful and I was pleased with the outcome.Pete was always I gentleman, sportsman and never will forget when he said ""I let the racket do the talking"""
1,Non existent,You sent a copy not suitable for viewing in Sweden.I am sure the DVD is great but I can not see it. The other DVD:s i bought were fine.
2,Not quite what you're looking for,"I must say I am disappointed. I was looking for a book for the amateur gilder, and I got a book for the gilding hobbyist. This book teaches you to gild objects around the home (i.e. picture frames, tassels, and yes--even a toilet seat), but does not go any further than that. For the purposes of gilding as a hobby, this book is complete. For the purposes of practical gilding (like sculpture, architecture, and wood work), this book is lacking, and there is nothing in the book's description or title to suggest as much. So, be warned."
1,ducks dvd,"The case of the dvd was very damaged. Luckily the dvd itself was not damaged, but I wouldn't be surprised if others were."
4,"O, to Serve and Volley like Gerulaitis!","This is a great addition to my collection of tennis DVDs. It is an unforgettably thrilling match, and I was very impressed with Gerulaitis - one of the best serve-and-volley exponents ever. The video quality was not great, probably because I got used to HD TV. Plus, the grass gets worn out by the semifinals and does not offer a good contrast to the white tennis balls of yore. I got over it by adjusting the color/tint/contrast functions on my TV. Nevertheless, this should be in every serious fan's collection because it show cases the best of a memorable personality. (Gerulaitis, not Borg, although Borg had to play at his very best to win the match. But, then, that is expected of Borg - winning the championship without any huffing and puffing.)"
4,Fun and Funky,"My whole family, from age 5 to 50, loves to listen to this album! ""Jesus is God"" is really in your face both musically and lyrically. It's probably my favorite song on the album. Another strong cut is ""God is Good"". This album isn't going to set the world on fire, but with it's funky music and funky lyrical imagery, it's a lot of fun to listen to."
1,"Ugh, crappy, save your time, watch paint dry instead","Only for the movie Deadhunters, a Spanish sort of film.Put your hand on your chin, rest your elbow on your knee and that's how you watch this movie. Because it is boring. Deadhunters, a Spanish sort of film. Dare I call it film? It starts semi-ok, then goes horribly crappy. It has ok gore, but still substandard. Ugh!Still, doesn't everything sound better in Spanish, even with the bad translation? At least this has somewhat better dialogue that `Dead Summer'! It starts out ok and then it deteriorates into crap. Watch this only for the music, it is a great metal rock soundtrack. Gothic feel in the costume design. It has bad bad bad acting, wanna be sexy crappy acting.Just like the made-for-you-tube-`movies'.Still bad movie, nice soundtrack, but badly placed. Really ok few songs in the soundtrack though. Feels like a video game around the end. And then the ...no words for that handkerchief scene."
2,Not as good as the Football,See the title. I remembered playing a baseball game on SNES but I guess it wasn't this one. Not very much fun coming from the company who made (in my opinion) the best football video games ever.
1,No Art . . . No Science,"In this 199 page book only two and one-half pages are dedicated to how money is laundered and that's the art and science. Over 130 pages are dedicated to a country-by-country risk analysis and this information is easily available from a number of sources on the internet. If that is what you want, then this is a great book. If you really want to know money laundering techniques and practices then look elsewhere.The number of missing details or oversight was frustrating. For example, page 1 of the book starts with ""placement"", which is interesting, but if you are new to anti-corruption or fraud investigation then it would be nice to know that placement is only the first step in money laundering. By the way, the other steps are layering and integration.I recommend Peter Lilley's book ""Dirty Dealing"" as a better introduction to money laundering."
4,Great headphones with a cord that DOES NOT TANGLE!,"I don't review a lot, but I just want people to know that if you are tired of earbuds and clip-on headphones always tanging, these things are the way to go! Great sound, the cord doesn't tangle, durable... the only problem is the padding is a bit thin so they can get uncomfortable after a while.I got mine for $20, they seem to be hard to find now but you might have better luck on the auction site."
4,A decent box set for Noein,"This box set takes the five individually released DVDs and puts them into one package. The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains only four.The first disc was the best when it came to bonus features. The second and third disc had decent features. The fourth and fifth discs, however, were a disappointment. It felt like they put too many special features on the first disc, and then ran out of features and were forced to repeat a feature from the first disc.The series itself is very well done, and I would recommend this box set. For fans of Noein, this is definitely the way to go get the full series. Instead of having to pay $90-$100 to pick up all five DVDs individually, you can purchase this box set for about $40."
5,This is how boxed sets are SUPPOSED to be made.,"I'm going to review the product, not the series (although the series is amazing) - just a heads up. This boxed set is absolutely gorgeous. Honestly, whoever packaged this knew what they were doing, which is a refreshing break from most anime boxed sets. I don't regret a single penny spent on it. It's got a fresh, stylish look - very color coordinated, and the design elements work well. The dvd menus are very impressive, very professional. The audio and subtitle options are great. The special features are also quite admirable. I'm pretty hard to please, but every time I look at this set, I feel instantly satisfied. Make it a purchase!"
3,Almost Perfect,"It comes in a box with 5 dvd's in all, it's everything that it claims, the only thing that keeps me from 5 stars is that one of the discs was loose in it's box when it arrived to me so it had time to get scratched up, still works fine but I wasn't happy about that."
5,Noein - The Complete Series,"If you are interested in, or believe in, quantum physics, this is the anime for you. It will undoubtably leave you thinking about all the possibilities of the unknown. I loved it, and have watched it several times already."
4,Exciting Callas Biography! A Must for Opera Lovers!,"Huffington has written a well-balanced biography after years of research. She delineates all of the obstacles Maria Callas had to overcome in her rise to the top of the opera world. Her tragedies and her triumphs are portrayed in fascinating details. She does not allow Onassis to dominate too many pages, yet shows us how futile the relationship was and the heartbreak Maria suffered when Mr. O. married Jackie Kennedy. The sheer number of operas Maria performed around the world, often under trying circumstances, is phenomenal. Her quest for the perfection of her art was a gift to the ages.Virginia W."
2,Maria Callas,"It would be fine for someone who loves and knows all the operas and all the characters in them. For me, it could have been covered in one chapter."
3,Jupiter Menace,vhs was ok. did not seem to be clear for a new video. looked more like a copy. managed to make a dvd off a computer rip.
5,Most Engrossing NHL Game With No Fighting,"This game is the best EAsports NHL game for Super Nintendo and Sega. It may not have fighting but the hits are still the best and you can actually see your player. Maneuverability is superb and more fun that the 95-2000 games where all you can see is colored blurs of passing players...you can actually pass in this game and determine strategies. You know the players, their weights and strengths, making the game fun to play as you work up to the Stanley Cup. I defy anyone to tell me the new flame games are better!"
1,ok Hockey game,"decent game, but it hasn't aged well. only worth purchasing for hardcore fan. 1 star."
5,HELLO WORLD =THATS ME AND MY SIGN WITH FRIEND,This paperback version is better because there is a better picture of me [no arm blocking my face ]+ my friend is on this cover. We will be doing a book signing world tour as soon as [BOB] sends us our advances.- Those countries not supporting the U.S.A. are off the tour p.s. lets make this a better world
5,YUMMY,"I bought a CASE of this. I had found a bottle at local market and really liked it. Some friends liked it as well, so Ive been giving them away. It is really good. In soups, on meat, french bread, whatever!!!And the price is right!!!!! Its a must try."
3,Disappointed,I own Sylvia's cookbook(great soulfood recipes!)but was disappointed in the seasoned salt. Used a generous amount in a recipe but didnt flavor much. Sorry Amazon.
1,not what is pictured,This is the correct fit for a replacement but it is not what is pictured as far as color is concerned. It is a dark burned red color hinge not a black color as is pictured in the description. Very disappointing for me.
3,Wild Huckleberry Candy Gift Crate,"This was purchased as a gift for the holidays because huckleberries are not a common item. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, the gift has still not been opened. The crate arrived, though, looking just like the picture"
3,No thrilled - but perfect fro travel,"Have used twice - bought for travel use only. For some reason the black curlers are hotter than the red. Thought about returning it , but not worth paying hte return shipping."
1,Pathetic...,"I bought these for a two-week tent camping trip to Colorado. I have a car-inverter for my laptop and figured I could get a nice, little set of hot rollers I could plug in once in a while and make myself look a little bit more presentable! I got them on the way rather than beforehand, so didn't know until we were a state or two away from point of purchase that they didn't work....AT ALL. I think ONE got a little warmish...but I'm not completely sure of that. I thought maybe it was plugging them into the car that was the problem (although everything else electric worked with that set-up), so I tried plugging them into a campground bathroom outlet...again, nothing. It said they would heat up in 90 seconds!! I'm thinking maybe they meant 90 hours."
2,NOT TOO HAPPY,"THEY DO HEAT UP FAST... AND THE SIZE IS PERFECT, BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON THEY DO NOT STAY IN PLACE... THE PIN DON'T HELP...ROLLERS. AND THEY ARE TOO HEAVY FOR THE ACTUAL PIN"
1,Wish I'd read some of the one-star reviews before I bought....,"I have the same problems mentioned by many of the one-star reviewers - the clips are too short for the roller, the roller's surface can't handle my fine hair, etc. A useful travel size for emergency use only."
2,So-so,"These rollers heat up fine -- but they get so hot and it's hard to hold them and put them in. I even went back to my old electric rollers that were older and take longer to heat up -- but at least I don't burn my fingers on them. I like the small, travel aspect of this set, but they are not as easy to use and put in because of the way they are structured. Your fingers get burned putting them in."
3,Expected more but i know what i did wrong,"I did not realize the difference in size, i thought all the rollers included were the same size because a friend of mine has the same set and hers comes with all the rollers in the same size. I have too much hair for only 10 rollers especially since 5 of them are smaller. I do like that they are very portable though."
4,Yay! I have curls!,"I was skeptical based on other reviews, but they worked really well. Rolled easily, but the clips left a little to be desired, the rolls kept flopping around, but that may have been user-error. I have shiny, bouncy curls.. I hope they last!"
2,Ummm no,I have very fine hair and the curlers just didn't take. I don't know if they would work better on longer or thicker hair but it was a total bust for me. If returning wasn't such a pain I would do that.
5,Good rollers,"The overall unit has a great compact size and shape. They heat up quickly and get more hot than my previous rollers did, which I like."
1,Roller Clips Much Too Short,"The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short. Rollers fall out. If clips were longer, they would probably work. Suggestion: Make longer clips. Other than that, it looks to be a nice product even though I wasn't able to try it out. Signed, Spouse."
2,Not as advertized,"This product was advertized as having 5 large and 5 x large rollers. The rollers we not large, let alone x large. I returned the product."
2,Not what I expected,They did not get very hot and did not work in my hair. I could only attempt to curl one half of my hair and it didn't work. Not satisfied with product.
5,Remington ceremic electric hair rollers,It is small and very portable. The only thing I would change is the medium rollers. The medium rollers should be replaced by large rollers.
1,very low heat,liked the size - just what I wanted for travel. Great except they do not heat up well. What is the point of being the right size if they don not work? Very luke-warm.
1,Poorly made,These rollers are compact and a nice size for medium length hair. However they do not stay in with metal pins or plastic clips. Also do not heat up well. Would return but shipping gets expensive and not worth it.
4,compact hot rollers,"I like the size. The curlers are heavier than most, but heat well. Make sure you push them all down into the connection or you might have a curler or two that doesn't heat up."
1,Rollers Fall out of hair!,I really hate these rollers - very frustrating as they fall out the minute you put them in - I had forgotten I had already written this! UPDATE - STILL AWFUL -
2,Just started using and not thrilled...,"Heavy, hard to get them to stay in place and awkward, takes too long to work and the result doesn't last long... May work better if you leave them in much longer, but they stay hot only for 15 minutes so you have to reheat."
3,"eh alright, too small and not enough.","these rollers are okay, but not great. I have long hair (upper/middle back) and these rollers are too small and not jumbo like described. They are the medium sized rollers and just do not work with how long my hair is. Also, there is definitely not enough of them either for a full head of hair so I will need to buy 2 or 3 more sets, but I would only buy more if they are actually jumbo sized as stated. Only good for short, thin hair."
1,remington h-1015 hot rollers,"I was very disappointed in the size of the rollers. The x-large are more the size of (large) the large are more the size of (medium )...I have very baby fine hair cut into a bob. These rollers do not stay in even with clips that I purchased extra...On the positive side, they heat up well and what curlers I could keep in made a wonderful curl, if you are trying for curls."
4,great product,"This is a replacement set for some Remington hot curlers I owned for many years. The first few times the curlers did not get very hot, but after a few uses they will get hot enough to watch your fingers. The pins are really wimpy and do not hold the curlers well enough in place - one star off for that. I replaced them with some new ones from a beauty supply store. The set is also dual voltage, which is important for me for overseas travel. They are compact for travel and are not very heavy. Would I buy them again? Most definitely! I had researched for a while, before buying this set and did not find anything better for my needs."
2,Not a travel product-but works well,"I really like this hairsetter. It is very small, doesn't get tangled in my hair, and is really easy to use. However: I purchased it for a trip to Europe but when I received it I didn't see the 110/220 emblem on the cord. I looked for a switch but couldn't find one. Although the website and even the pamphlet list this as dual voltage, it is not. I emailed Remington and they confirmed that this is not a dual-voltage product. So I will be taking it to Europe but with a converter."
2,Not That Good,The quick curl rolls and the claims keep falling off of my hair. They don't stay long enough to curl my hair at all.
5,Great for home and travel!,"I've owned a couple of sets of these. (They tend to look worn out from regular use every couple of years and I replace them - even though they're still working fine). In fact, I bought one set just to keep in my travel bag - and replaced my regular ""big home set"" with these, as well. They heat up very quickly and leave a long lasting curl (even if you leave them in just a short time). They are particularly great for fine hair, and these have better clips than the last set I bought. (These wire clips don't leave a kink in your curl like the plastic ""clip all the way around the curl"" type does.) Really, a great value and great product all around!"
3,Clips provided are useless!,"While first using this product, clips would not hold rollers in place. Rollers also don't seem to have enough gripping texture. I bought the Conair Super Clips and they work perfectly at holding rollers. Over-all I am pretty happy with these hot rollers, although it is the first time I have ever used somethiing like this."
2,So So,A bit disappointing. It sure is convenient and compact but doesn't heat up all that well and not as quickly as advertised. It is quite economical but I guess you get what you pay for.
4,hot curlers,"Surprisingly hot within minutes of being plugged in. It's not scorching on the fingers to handle but hot enough to get hair to the curliness that is wanted. Totally surprised by this product, am glad I picked it up for such a cheap price. Also not as damaging as hot irons"
1,defective,"Wish these had worked for me, as I love the compact size and I have fine hair, so I don't need as many curlers. However, only 4 of the 10 rollers heated up- the remaining six didn't. Remington, you're dead to me."
2,Size Matters,I was so excited when I ordered this based on reviews but so disapponted when I received. It stated 5 large rollers and 5 jumbo rollers - not true! It's more like 5 medium rollers and 5 slightly bigger medium rollers.
2,"First one great... second one, not at all.",I ordered 1 and it worked so well I ordered another. I wanted enough rollers to do my whole head. The 2nd one was terrible. . ..5 out of 10 rollers didn't get hot.They're very inexpensive but still. . ..they should work.
4,Nice curlers but not for short hair,"I purchased these because I wanted some curl to my very straight, fine hair. The packaging is very compact and very portable. The metal pins held even my fine hair in place. They did not get ""hot"" in 90 seconds as advertised (more like 4-5 min) to get more than just ""warm"", with the lid sealed.The amount of curlers were just right for my shoulder length hair, however the red rods were too big and just produced ""body"" not so much curls.I would think if you had longer hair and or just wanted body this would be a 5++. And I bought them at that ""red"" super department store for just 12.99! Overall, I would recommend as they are nice - just didnt suit my needs."
2,Works just ok.,Takes a long time to heat and rollers don't stay in very easily. I don't know why they can't make better hot rollers.
3,My wife used a couple of times then gave them away,"These did not meet my wife's expectations but they may well be more a result of her lofty expectations rather than the quality of the product. For that reason, I rated an average 3-stars."
3,My curls don't hold,"If the curls held, this would be the best invention ever made. I put them up and leave them for 5 min or so and then take them off, that is so much faster than any other hair curler, but my curls though they look great, they barely hold for one hour, I figure it's not hot enough... or need some kind of hair spray... not sure..."
1,No good,"This has got to be designed for people with super fine hair. I have average, Irish hair and this does not get high enough to do anything for my hair. The rollers do not offer uniform heat, some do not even get hot, only slightly warm. I've been doing my hair since I was 12, and have used several roller sets for updos and this is one of two that is just no good. I was excited at the portability of this, and it is portable... it just doesn't work. Save your money. I even tried to do tiny tendrils of only a tiny amount of hair and it still was not hot enough."
2,Medium and small not large,"Curlers don't heat up well, don't stay in hair . Clips don't hold and they only included 0ne clip per curler, took to post office to return and it would be over $6, so I'm keeping them.."
2,Remington H-1015 Ceramic Rollers,"Thougnt this product would work on curly hair but there is no grip to hold hair onto rollers, making hair just slip off rollers. Pins do not hold rollers in place. Should have believed reviews I read prior to purchasing. Returning would cost about as much as cost of rollers. Guess I'll just give them away."
5,Love it.,"What a bargain. This is my second set of these rollers. I had the first set for 3-4 years. I like them for travel since they are so compact but I used them every single day. They hold up under the beating they get because I drop them on my ceramic tile floor all the time. I have super fine, straight as a stick hair with no body what so ever. If you use 8-10 they give you curls, less you get waves and less just body. Lasts all day even after I brush out the hairspray. Still have body and waves until I wash my hair again the next morning."
4,Compact for sure,"Great size, don't get too hot to handle. Not the absolute best solution for thick hair, but curls hold for a couple of hours."
3,Good Quality,"I used it a few times and I only use the large rollers, but even then, it created really pronounced curls (which I don't really like too much). I brought this with me to Japan and used it once there too. It travels pretty nicely. I'm glad that the voltage worked and that it heats up really fast, but I can't stand those metal holders. They are hard to align and keep in your hair. I prefer using my curling iron to this, but it's still a good product."
1,not for big hair,This item does not do the work. I have a 15 year old Vidal Sassoon. I felt I needed more rollers and decided the buy the biggest rated ones.SOrry but it does not do the work unless you are light haired!
4,Not Dual volatege - Pin is too short,"1. The pin is not long enough to hold the hair tightly. The roller falls down. I switched the red pin with the other longer pin (over 1/2 inch more), the roller is held right at the desire location on my hair.2. Is this a dual voltage unit as of its advertising? I read the use and care guide, and I only found 120 volts. Did you send me wrong model?3. Can you exchange the one with dual voltage?4. Can you give me longer pin? instead of the original pins?Thank you very much.Best regards,Your customer."
1,Useless for fine hair,"Do not get that hot, pins are difficult to use, rollers are heavy and do not stay in fine/thin hair."
3,Not large and x large at all,"The product description says 5 large and 5 X large rollers. The rollers were very small, they are small and medium sized. Returning it."
1,Fail,I bought these and returned them. They don't get hot. More like lukewarm rollers. It's really too bad because the size would make them ideal for travel.
3,Remington Electric Rollers,I have a difficult time getting these to stay in my hair. I think that maybe longer pins may be needed.
2,Travel Curlers,"I would probably never buy travel curlers without looking at them. I have moderately curly hair that gets a little unruly so I need just a few electric curlers. These do not have any prongs to help grab.As a travel set there is not a place that holds the cord......it is just out and flops around so that is not put away neatly in the little red case, which the picture does not show the cord. So in summary if you had straight hair I would think these curlers would not stay in your hair very well they would slip out and the compactness with cord is not good. They do get very hot."
2,Rollers small,"I thought from the pic that five of the rollers were large, but they're more like medium and small. They heated well, but my hair is too long I guess. :("
3,"OK, ...",The product is fine for curling your hair. It gets really hot to the touch and burns your fingers a little. Also not too great for longer hair. I needed larger rollers and more of them. But it is small and easy to travel with.
5,Hair Rollers (Remington),"I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully. I also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office, gym and around the world. They are easy to pack and are lightweight."
1,Too hot to handle,"While compact, light weight and small-sized for travel, I had to give a poor review as flocked rollers have spoiled me. This Remington ceramic set got so hot that I could barely stand to touch them to wind up my hair. Also the smoother ceramic surface meant that the rollers did not grasp the hair strands as they are wound. And the clips weren't enough to keep the rollers in place and they flopped. This not only created a flatter overall look, but the hot rollers were now sending heat to my forehead instead of my hair. In addition, the diameter of the rollers of the set are also relatively narrow, so they couldn't have created the look I was after anyway. I should have been able to figure the last part out, but I was hopeful as the overall dimension was about what I wanted for my small suitcase. I ended up being so dissatisfied that I left this roller set behind in the hotel."
1,NOT for fine hair,"I have fine hair & even with putting my usual styling products in before using these hot rollers I was very disappointed in them. I could not get them to stay in my hair anyway I tried, they kept falling out. Plus they were SO hot against my scalp I couldn't stand it & just ended up taking them out (before some fell out on their own). I really liked the ""travel pack"" design but I guess I should of known most of the time ""you get what you pay for"". I'm going back to steam rollers such as The Caruso hair setter that always worked for me in the past."
1,Can't keep 'em in,I agree with the other fine hair people...you can't keep these curlers in. the clips slide off so they roll out. Either the clips are all wrong or the curlers need something more to stick like velvet covering. Rather than return these I will purchase a bunch of plastic hair clips and just clip the curler with them because they do heat fast and curl nicely.
4,Good rollers,"Good rollers, some didn't clip in very well in my medium length layers but the long layers were ok. I need to get the hang of clipping them in and not burning my fingers. Its been SO many years since I used hot rollers and they haven't changed. These are good overall"
4,Good product,I think the product is compact they definetly curled my hair. I think the clip things could use some work. maybe I just don't know what I am doing with these things.
4,Roller Review,"This product arrived on time! The rollers were a bit smaller than I wanted, but they are convenient for traveling."
1,good if you like your finger tips and scalp burned,Dreadful hair rollers. Firstly..there are no large..just five medium...and five small ones that are too small to be of any use. They get so hot..that you have to turn it off for five mins to handle them. I have fine hair so they burned my scalp.Why oh why is it not possible to buy even eight medium rollers..all the same size..that get hot..but not THAT hot.....that you can travel the world with...????I am mystified how people gave good reviews on this product...what on earth did they do with the tiny rollers?
1,CAUTION: NOT DUAL VOLTAGE!,Do not buy this product if you are planning to use it in countries with 220v output. This is not dual voltage and you'd have to use a converter. I'm very disappointed and am sending it back immediately.
5,I BOUGHT TWO,They are great rollers. I liked them so much I purchased a second set. I have not used them for travel as of yet...but these are now part of my primary go-to hair style.
2,Remington heated rollers,"compact and good for travelling but disappointed as plug sockets unsuitable in UK and had to purchase separately universal plug (a further 6.99) also found rollers difficult to keep in place, certainly not like ones I had some years go (different make). chose Remington as thought would be ideal"
2,Less features than old version,"I have been using this product for 20 years, I believe this is my third vresion of the set. One problem with this version was the ill fitting clips. But most troublesome issue was that they left off the velcro cord storage compartment, which made it much easier to travel with. Now there is no where to store the cord. I hope the next version of these rollers add this feature back."
2,Fooled by the stellar reviews!,"I have long hair- past my shoulders. It's in layers; it's finely textured but there's a lot of it- these rollers curled half of my hair. Maybe you'd say, ""Oh, well- buy another set!"" No. These rollers are so slippery and rubbery that it was nearly impossible to roll that one half. I tried hairspray, I tried using smaller amounts of hair, larger amts, etc...it's like rolling your hair around a plastic hairbrush handle. The only good I would say about it is that the clips fit pretty well and the heat is decent. Obviously, there are women out there with different hair than mine that love these but if you have hair that's anything like what I described, there are better sets out there!"
3,You have to buy curler clips,"I like these curlers, but you have to use them with curler clips (the grey, claw-like ones), or else your hair is likely to get fuzzy if it is fine. They are good for travel, but they don't get super hot. If you're looking to enter into the world of hot rolling or get some travel rollers, this is great, if you want more than that, get a better set."
2,is this a toy?,"You get what you pay for... these rollers are in my trash. They didn't curl my hair, they got warm but not hot. Maybe I didn't wait long enough— is 10 minutes long enough?"
5,Compact and Heat up fast,"I Love these Hair curlers. They work well and heat up quickly. They are very easy to store which I like because sharing a bathroom with 5 others doesn't leave much room for my stuff. I only have 2 bad things about them that I can deal with. 1- There aren't many of them so sometimes you have to wait to do the rest of your hair, and 2 they can burn your fingers. When I roll up my hair which is shoulder length I have slightly burnt my finger tips from the heat."
5,Disney's Little Einsteins,"My gandaughter is 2 and she has loved all of the little einsteins series. great kids movies, teaches and entertains."
3,2 year old loves Einstien,My son enjoys this video-he doesn't enjoy seem to like it as much as others but it is his personal preference.
2,waste of money,"I rushed to purchase this second DVD yesterday, which was the actual release date. I also have the first movie, ""Our (Big) Huge Adventure"". My daughter loves Little Einsteins.I am VERY disappointed in Disney and the Einstein Company. I thought the first movie was very creative and thoughtful. ""Team Up For Adventure"" is such a waste of money. I can't believe I paid $20 for it. It's a really lazy production... three episodes put back to back and called a movie. It's better for parents just to record episodes every morning off the television."
2,you can record these episodes for free.,As already stated Disney did not say that these were not new and we were very disappointed to discover they were ones we had already seen. Very misleading advertising.
5,2 yr old,"A guy helped me with my computer didn't charge me, so I bought his little girl this video... Rocks!"
3,Mostly old material,"I thought this was a movie like the Big Huge Adventure. Instead this is ""I Love to Conduct"" and ""How We Became Little Einsteins"" both of which are shown almost once a week on Disney. There is a new show Rocket's Safari, but I imagine that will show up on the Disney Channel soon enough.Fine if you just want episodes of the show on DVD, but not much new material."
2,"2 old, 1 new","What's up with only one new episode? We preordered this video at the beginning of the year assuming it was going to be as good as the first one. (There obviously were no reviews about the DVD since it hadn't even been released.) We have all the LE episodes on our TiVo, so it was very disappointing to see that we paid for ONE new episode. (This new episode better not air on TV because I'll want my money back!) Even though I was not happy with this purchase, my 3 year old loves to watch the new episode."
3,Not my favorite.,"I was also feeling like I had been duped. Two of these videos aired on Disney already and they certainly aren't my favorites. However, my son seems to enjoy the entire series so we are keeping the video. From now on I'll be sure to read the packaging more closely when I'm shopping."
1,Little Einsteins Team Up For Adventure,"RIP OFF!!! Shame on Disney for billing this as a ""Triple-Length Adventure"" when in fact it is 2 old episodes from the TV show and 1 new one. $20 for 1 new show???? If you call Disney at 800-723-4763 they will give you a 1 time exchange if you were unfortunate enough to buy this DVD."
5,Great DVD for my 2 year old......,"My daughter (2yrs) loves the L.E. Huge Adventure, so I was happy when this was released. I purchased it even though I make it a point not to purchase episode DVDs. Since LE comes on when we are generally doing the school run for older sib or OUT PLAYING, I didn't think twice about making this purchase.My daughter really loves LE Team Up for Adventure. And I am pleased with my purchase."
5,Educational Fun,"Disney's Little Einsteins is a great buy for the family. It's entertaining enough to sit down and watch with your child, unlike some other children's cartoons. Best of all, the entire series brings many lessons and facts that children will remember and are sure to enjoy as they learn about them. The series will make a wonderful addition to an existing children's movie collection as well as a fantastic gift to parents with young children. Don't wait! Order yours today!"
1,Agree - RIP OFF!!!,"I rather pay this amount for multiple released shows then target it as a ""Triple Adventure"" with only 23min out of 69min of new material. Plus, only one bonus feature??? Come on - Huge Adventure was so much better. Also - why are you using the same songs over again. Pick some new ones."
3,ok read,"this book will not teach you a lot. it will, however, point you into a direction where you should venture into if you want to learn directX 2D or 3D. the matrix lessons are a bit too complicated with the way the author explained it, considering that matrix arithmetic is not too difficult. there are a few pages containg cryptic matrix multiplication examples which could have been explained in a few sentences like in lamothe's tricks of the trade book( lamothe explains math better ). but i give it 3 stars for a decent read. it is a good addition to a game programmers collection"
4,"ARS, Live @The Savoy","Well, it is not as good as ""Are You Ready"", but what is? Sound quality is excellent. Performance is excellent with a few exceptions, but thats why I like live albums. Very nostalgic. It takes me back to the carefree days of the late 70's and early 80's. I strongly recomend to original ARS fans like me."
3,please someone release ''ARE YOU READY'',"i have looked everywhere for this cd. i have the album but it is in baaaaad shape. who makes these decisions on these re releases? anyone with any pull reading this, believe me, ARE YOU READY will sell like a sumbitch."
4,excellent late period ARS,"OK admittedly 1981 was the backside of the bands popularity. They had a few singles that broke, but most of us who were longtime fans felt like they had left something behind with the slickness of the songs like Do It or Die and Imaginary Lover and the departure of Robert Nix, who was a co-writer on so many of the bands classic songs. However, this disc shows a band that continues to burn hot while showing a high degree of professionalismThe disc starts of with Champagne Jam and Not Going to Let It Bother Me Tonight. Both are tight and provide an easy entry to the set. Songs like Homesick and Large Time give one of rock and rolls most underrated guitar players , Barry Bailey a chance to shine. Ronnnie Hammond is spot on as a vocalist and the rhythm section kicks everyone's butt.Highly recomend. I much prefer this to Are You Ready"
1,Where's the beef?,"Sadly the reviewers who gave this book 5 stars must be friends of the author or paid to write positive reviews. Truly, this book is simply a collection of reheated generalizations we have read a thousand times before. I get tired of the line that the french women do everything so wonderfully and the Americans are so gauch. It is annoying to be hit over the head with almost every single paragraph citing some lifestyle atrocity Americans are committing on themselves. If you want a good book about getting slim the french way read French Women don't get Fat by Mireille Guiliano. Or, for an insightful, balanced perspective, read the wonderful book by the Australian author Sarah Turnbull Almost French:Love and a New Life in Paris. I hope that I have given someone pause before buying - I was so disappointed that I believed the good ratings and wasted my money on her books."
1,"Reads like a pamphlet compared to C&S Encore, which is a real book.","Skip this book in favor of C&S Encore. This book has the SAME info, but Encore includes so much more. The thickness of the book alone is just a fraction of Encore. I like AB, but this book isn't worth it."
3,Not bad...,"Anne Barone has put together an explanation of the mythical habits of ""chic French women"" and FWIW, it's not bad advice. There are several books out at the moment which discuss how it is that French women captivate the rest of the world. It isn't the best of these books but it is the first"
3,"Common sense advice, mostly.","I thought it was an ok book, though *most* of it I had already guessed could help control my weight (eating slowly, not snacking too often, etc.) There are a few things that I wouldn't have thought of, and the author makes a good connection between self-respect and the ability to lose weight. Some of what she suggests doesn't mesh with rural lifestyles well, or for those of us living with other people who wouldn't appreciate the relative inconvience in eating."
2,Elle n'ya pas tres jolie!,"Mlle. Barone certainly shares some very practical advice for ""thinking and living French."" However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. She appears to be very judgmental and almost without humor. She definitely is not the possessor of the blase style which she espouses. She seems so grimly determined to live her little French life and seems annoyed with having to see to family emergencies, characterizes her Texas brother as a bit stupid and definitely would not care for this reviewer who is politically conservative! Her whole attitude lacks that light, je ne sais quoi attitude of the French woman!!!!!"
1,WARNING: Please read this before considering purchase,"I have all three of Ms. Barone's books. I enjoyed her writings. There were many helpful references. However, this woman does not practice what she teaches. She is very prejudiced towards Americans who do not agree with her politics. She does not want anyone who may have voted for anyone other than Kerry to purchase her books. See her website for confirmation. There are so many more useful resources for those seeking to enhance their life by being 'chic.' There are even Yahoo chats that are charming. Ms. Barone does not exemplify the type of woman that I am trying to emulate. She is definitely 'pas chic.'"
1,Don't waste your money like I did.,"This is a short read, and I started out thinking it was going to be good. But after a while you get the idea that this author, Anne Barone, is just looking for a way to put down Americans as fat, lazy, slobs with zero style. She seems to be overly-enamored with the French as to make ridiculous statements. She seems to think if only we American women would be as adulterous as the French, we could stay slim since we would want to fit into that slinky lingerie for our lovers! I have found out that sometimes when people have no other skills, they put their viewpoints down on paper, call it a book and sell it. Try Will Clower's ""The Fat Fallacy"" or Gin Sander's ""The Martini Diet"" instead. These are enjoyable reads that will show you ways to enjoy delicious food and lose weight without denying yourself pleasure. I think Anne Barone was trying to fit into this genre, but she can't hold a candle to these other 2 books."
1,thank goodness I read the customer review,"I had no idea this author was such an idiot. Thank goodness I read the prior review, visited her web site, and then made the informed decision not to buy such political garbage woven into a book. As a native Texan I take offense. She is seriously misguided. I will get my advise elsewhere."
4,Ty Ling Crystallized Ginger With Fresh Ginger,"I like this brand because of its less sugar content. To kick it up a notch, try them along with either sliced or grated fresh ginger!"
4,Very Comfortable!,"I bought this item for prom, I was wearing a nude colored dress that had some sheer fabric you could see through on my sides. Though I might have bought a color a little to dark for my dress, it was still unnoticeable, and the great thing about it, it was very comfortable all night, probably the most comfortable thing I wore to prom! Great product, just the price is a little to much just for one undergarment."
1,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE and product quality is not good as online explanation and picture,"This is the first time i write review on Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the seller ""In the Mood Intimates"".Product quality is not good as online explanation and picture. Very very thin and too big.DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS from In the Mood Intimates. This seller is just horrible. I had THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE in my life. In the Mood Intimates will NOT accept return and exchange. Even the size you order is too big to wear. Stop wasting your time and money. Don't shop the seller who doesn't accept return&exchange;."
1,Disappointment,The hose does not stay on the vacuum or the attachments very well. It is rather heavy but perhaps that is because it is a shop vac hose.
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I would caution anyone not to waste valuable resources on this book. And do not listen to the ""get it while it's publicly available"" nonsense either. You could probably get a manual on nuclear reactors too, but it wouldn't mean you could teach yourself to run one and it wouldn't make you a nuclear physicist. If you really want a Gardnerian or Alexandrian BOS, contact a legit coven and get yours the old-fasioned way, earn it. You can buy this book, and even learn it by heart word-for-word, but it will not make you Gardnerian or Alexandrian. Wicca is lineaged and experiential. You can't get it solely from a book. Even if a legit Gardnerian or Alexandrian HP/HPS handed you their BOS, it's not enough. There is much more to it. Too bad there is a one star minimum."
1,Huh?,"Both Alexandrian and Gardnerian Wicca are Oath Bound, lineage based religions. Covens of these traditions do not publish their Book of Shadows and only initiates of their Coven would have access to their Book of Shadows. These people have to prove to be trustworthy and able to keep their oaths including not discussing or showing their Book of Shadows to non-initiates, before having access to it. Sure, there is basic information on these traditions via books, the internet, etc. But the information is not the whole of these traditons in the least. In order to be a part of these traditions and call yourself an Alexandrian, Gardenarian, or other British Traditional traditions, you must be initiate into a coven that has direct lineage to Gerald Gardner.... not by reading a book."
1,Burn the Witch...,"...who thinks that this is what it's all about.This is just a rehashing of publically available resources. If you can get on the net to buy the book, you can search google.com to find this stuff online.But ""Gardner"" makes one crtical error... no context. These things, alone, are like building ahouse without a blueprint. You may come up with a decent house, but probably not what the architects had in mind.(That and decendants of G.Gardner and A. Sander's sects DON'T interchange materials!)"
4,Simply Wonderful,This is a wonderful book. It explains the spells and rituals very well and is a must read for all practitioners out there!
5,Age spots due to sun damage,"My naturopathic doctor prescribed Solaire to combat sun damage. She believes it not only helps minimize age spots, but prevents further sun damage. This product is not easy to find in a typical health food store, so it's great that it can be easily ordered on Amazon."
5,A great summary of the President by those who knew him best,"Outstanding review of the President by those who knew him best. Detailed interviews with members of the cabinet, advisors and family members. The interviews are broken down into categories (such as Alexander Haig, Domestic policy, etc.) and it is fascinating to hear what those closest to the situation had to say. For Reagan fans, it will confirm his position as the greatest leader of the 20th Century (although it is not biased in any way)."
1,Our most Treasonous president...,This lopsided book won't change the minds of most Americans who agree that ronald reagan was one of the decietful presidents this century. He makes Nixon and Clinton look GOOD. He subverted the Constitution and lied to both Congress and the American People over the Iran Contra scandal--one of the most embarassing and shameful incidents in American History.
2,Good history on securities operations,"Probably best used as an introductory text in a college course or as your first book on the subject. In the fast paced world of securities processing 1995 is ancient history. One section discusses the use of magnetic tapes to transfer data for comparing trades as an up-comming technology.That being said, I found the book to be very well written, easy to read and understandable. There was a good amount of detailed information and all the acronyms and buzz words were explained as you went along."
5,For all adult catholics,"This is an excellent review of the Catholic faith. The other booklets in this series are excellent as well. All adult Catholics should read these books to renew/enhance/review their faith. Also, they are an excellent basis for bible studies or Sunday school studies."
3,O'k Bible Study,This book has good passages that you study but some of the questions are not best suited for group discussion. Would recommend this more as an individual study resource vs. for groups.
2,Who knew it was an ad?,I was disapointed when I received the book and found that it was 1/2 a glossary of technical terms (not necessarily a bad thing but not what I needed) and one 1/2 half a big ad for a product called MeetingPlace. This one-product focus is not made clear in the description of the book.
3,Nice,"These are very nice, but are alittle heavy. The white diamond sections take away from the overall look. Still... for the price,,, a great deal!"
1,Stay away if you are running Tiger!,"This program is not compatible with OS 10.4, and Norton has no plans to upgrade SystemWorks or Utilities to be compatible with OS 10.4..."
1,Don't bother if you're running Panther with large files,"Spent $100 elsewhere on this. I've used Norton in the past but had switched to TechTool. I decided to try them again. I was sadly mistaken.First, I ran Disk Doctor. Got error 23005, which the support said to run Volume Recover. Nothing found there. Got the same error from Disk Doctor. Tried Disk DeFrag and it said that the directories were too large for ""this version"" of SystemWorks to defrag.Useless. I'll be returning it and using TechTool again."
1,STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING FROM SYMANTEC!!!!,"NORTON UTILITIES WILL SCRAMBLE YOUR HARD DRIVE IRREPARABLY!I purchased the latest version of Norton Utilities from the Symantec Website shortly after upgrading to the new Tiger system from Apple. Ran Norton Utilities, no errors, ran speed disk, scrambled directory. Had to erase hard drive.I am an expert Mac user and have been so since 1984. I have never had a system crash or any loss of data - ever. Symantec, you suck! You freely send software to loyal users accept $ in return with no prior upfront warning about known problems. I will never purchase software from you again, and will tell everyone in my sphere of influence to stay away from your company. If you own stock... SELL, SELL, SELL!"
4,Great troubled teen story,Inside Out is a favorite with my adolescent boy students who have reading difficulties. The chapters are short and action packed and students have trouble putting it down. The mentally ill main character is very likable. A must for all teachers looking for an easier read for boys.
3,It was okay,This book was about a boy with schizophrenia in a coffee shop that gets held up. The boys that hold up the shop were trying to get money for their sick mom. I think this book would be good for a person who doesn't like to read because it is exciting and has a good amount of suspense.
3,Attempts to have young people understand schizophrenia,"It's a quick read, only about a hour. It's fast paced so reluctant teen readers will probably finish it. I think the author did a good job making Zach likable and someone to have sympathy for having this horrible mental illness. I found myself just as interested or more so in Alan, the kindly older thief. I didn't want him tried as an adult since what he really wanted to do is help his mother buy medicine she needed. I wonder if Alan taken away the attention from the main character since Alan in some ways more interesting than Zach."
4,Inside out review,"This book is very exciting the main characters name is zach. Zach faces a severe case of schizophrenia. When he was in a coffee shop waiting for his mom. His mom always picks him up and gives him his pill, if zach doesnt get his pill he gets voices in his head and cant ever tell whats real. He then faces some big troubles with in this coffee shop with robbers.These robbers both have guns. They thought that they could get quick money. They needed the money because their mom has cancer. They tryed to take money and leave but then someone outside the coffee shop called the cops. All the people got stuck in the coffee shop and the robbers made all the people in the coffee shop go in the back room. Zach then saves the lifes of all the people with him in the backroom."
4,Inside Out,For the second book I read it was called Inside Out.This is about a Schizophrenic boy who is constantly confronted by rat and dirtbag.Zach Wahhsted is waiting in a coffee shop one morning when everything goes wrong.Two boys named Stormy and Frosty hold up the store.Everyone is afraid excpet for zach.To find out what hapens read Inside Out
3,neeah,"i liked the book because of humor styles it used and had other things i like itn it like ""maple bars"" although the book is good in these ways it is a bit short and the ending is a little bit depressing"
4,INSIDE OUT,Ever wonder what it would be like if you were schizophrenic? If you were a 16 year old boy and schizophrenic? A 16 year old boy who just got out of school and is waiting for his mother to come and pick him up at the local coffee shop so he can then take his meds. which he desperately needs? And do you wonder what it would be like if you were this boy and then all of a sudden the coffee shop you are in gets held up in a robbery and you suddenly become a hostage? This book will show you just how much of a weapon of self-destruction a mind can be. This book is very unique and is absolutely wonderful. I gave this book four stars because the ending is so very depressing.
4,Great Hat,I love the garden hat except for it don't sit on the head very well. I have a difficult time keeping it on my head while working. Suggestion would be to extend the brim more and to add an inch or two to the top part that sits on your head..Thank you...It did arrive in a timely manner
1,"Safe for humans, plants and aquatic life???",My husband put this in my small pond and by the next day over half of the 4 to 6 inch goldfish that I have had for 10 years were dead. He used less than half of what the instructions said.
4,This sucker still works,"Its been several years and this cheap little strobe still works, although the shipper did give me some hassels."
4,"Great product, installation had small hiccups.","I figured that I stood a good chance of a seamless upgrade since my router is also a d-link, but it was not problem-free. I did manage to clear things up pretty quickly and it turned out that in large part the error was mine, ...you have to follow the setup instructions EXACTLY...and it's worked beautifully ever since. I love not having to have one computer on all the time to allow other network computers to print and I've saved a bundle on electricity. Be aware however that d-link tech support is not super-saavy, and I suspect that it would not very be helpful to novice users."
4,"Good, definately upgrade firmware to version 2.00 and install latest printer driver though!","Good product, definately upgrade firmware to version 2.00 and install latest printer driver though!After upgrading the firmware to version 2.00, and downloading the latest driver for the Brother HL-2040 Laser printer, I got this printer to work with the D-Link DP-G321. I was able to print through both Windows XP and Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger)!I just wanted to let you know because this printer is not on the printer compatibility list for the DP-G321, and it should now be added to this list.One note though regarding an innaccuracy on D-Link's product documentation for this product, the print screens for the Mac OS X IP printing are incorrect...I have Mac OS 10.4 and these are not the screens you see when configuring this product..."
1,"If you have WPA, don't buy this","This product does not support WPA security and, according to D-Link, neither you or I should hold our breath that it will. Below is the vendor response when asked about future (and industry standard) WPA support on the DP-G321(17 Nov 2005)""Technical Support does not have the information if and when there will be a firmware that supports WPA. Right now it only supports WEP encryption. Please do not hold on to the device in anticipation of the same.Sorry for your inconvenience and thank you for understanding.""While I have been impressed with D-Link with some of their other products, this fails to impress and actually causes concern for the security conscious (the paranoid would freak)."
2,No Support for WPA regardless of Firmware Level,"DP-G321 Print Server.Correct/Full Printer support is very limited. D-Link dropped the ball on this one.Wireless Security support is limited to WEP - so it says. WPA does not work in any of its forms. I invite D-Link to counter. In non-security fashion, wireless is fine. But if you are in any residential or crowded environment, do not buy this print server. (You'd be a fool for not using some sort of extra security and WEP is not it...)End of Story.[Yes. I know this product EOL'd. I placed this to share my frustration with the deception regarding the WPA support - none. Further, there are those of us that can still use older HW to save the landfills... in China.]"
2,D-Link Return Problems,"Think twice before you buy this or any D-Link products. When this unit failed, it took my materials person 2 hours, 6 phone calls and 8 techs to get an RMA authorization. D-Link pay attention, you will be loosing business for poor performance. D-Link hassled my materials person instead of just issuing her an RMA. She had all of the information for the RMA prior to calling and it still took her 2 hours, 6 phone calls and 8 techs to get an RMA authorization!"
1,Review of DP-G321 Wireless-G Print Server,The installation documentation is totally inadequate. Was only able to get a glimmer of the problems by checking online other reviews of the product. After spending over 8 hours trying to get a satisfactory setup I decided to send it back. Printer port names and addressing are the main issues. Don't understand why D-Link would not sort this installation documentation problem out. It appears to have been going on since 2003 or earlier.
1,What a hassle...,"I have not been able to use this nice looking device, as the installation has been impossible. The manufacturer included a link in the booklet, but it is not in service. Technology is supposed to make life easier, not harder."
2,Terrible range for 802.11b,"Ive not yet upgraded my access point to 802.11g, but I bought this device because it will be ready when I do. Unfortunately, it doesn't have nearly the range of my 802.11b devices on my existing network. My cable modem and access point are one room over from my computer, with a single plaster wall in between. My 802.11b network cards connect to the network with about 60% signal strength and 11 Mbps speed. This device doesn't even see the network at the same range. Totally sux."
3,"not easy to setup, but works fine","The user guide is as poor as it can get. It assumes the user is very technical. However, after alot of wasted paper, I was able to get the print server to print correctly. But that was mostly my fault, as I didn't get the right printer driver installed.No WPA support, but if you check the UK website, it has firmware upgrade to support WPA. Is the US support site outdated? I'll have to try this out.(...)"
1,"Not a useful guide, for entertainment only.","Don't buy this book thinking that it is a comprehensive beginners guide to getting started with sea monkeys (the title of the book is definitely misleading). The informational content of this book is very minimal. You will find more information on the topic from various websites including the sea-monkey kit manufacturer's web site help/faq section. Most of this book is filled with content good for entertainment purposes only, there is not even any good pictures of the sea-monkeys themselves, only the author's quirky pursuits..."
5,Sister22,The unique style of this music is what drew me to buy this album. And the writing and lead vocals are great!! These guys are really making a statement with this one. I definitely recommend these Jersey guys to EVERYONE!!
2,A Love to Cherish,"This book was ok, the ending was nice. I realy cant say to much about it. I think its one of those books that you like it or you don't. The book did nothing for me. It was very easy reading."
4,Great nude shoe!,"I have been looking for a nude heel for months, but nothing I found was quite what I was looking for. These were a bit taller than what I was hoping for, but the price was right, so I decided to try them out. I was glad I tried them on at a local shoe store instead of ordering online, because I went down to an 8 1/2 instead of my normal 9. At first, I wasn't so sure about them comfort-wise (I almost never wear heels that are 3+ inches), but I've definitely broken them in after wearing them intermittently for about a week. I'm not on my feet all day, but I do a decent amount of walking around in my office and my feet feel just fine. My only complaint is that they scratch EXTREMELY easily and are already a bit beat up. I am a bit rough on my shoes and I know I probably bump into more stuff than the average person, but I was still disappointed. Overall, I am pleased with the shoe and am thrilled how great they look with all of my spring/summer outfits."
4,She's back!,This is one of the tightest cd's i've bought in a while and i must say the lil kim came out hard as hell on this album. teaming up with ceelo of goodie mob and redman and other artists made this album tight. she's one of the baddest female rappers out there. don't sleep up on this cd....go out and get it!
5,Notorious K.I.M.,"If you are looking for something exciting for the summer and are longtime fans of Little Kim, then you definitely need to check this album out. Hardcore-the extension. Little Kim added many knew flavors, from dance hip-hop, streeet, all the way to R&B. This is a great album and well worth the wait."
2,bad...,"I bought the edited version of LIL' KIM's new album, and I have to say that it is pretty bad. I mean, I haven't heard HARD CORE, but I've heard this CD and I was mad that I even bought it. The only decent tracks are #2,7,8,9,11,18. It may seem like a lot, but even these songs are pretty stinky. I like LIL' KIM's style and I think she has a lot of potential as a rapper, but her latest album stinks."
3,FREAKY V 2000,I THINK SHE SHOULDN'T EVEN CAME OUT WITH THIS CD OR EVEN THE LAST. I AT LEAST GIVE HER 3 STARS SHE IS A WOMAN TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THE INDUSTRY OF MUSIC TODAY AND I RESPECT THAT SO WHATEVER YOU DOING I GUESS KEEP ON.IF YOU LIKE HER THEN GET THE CD BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY.
2,Notorious Kim,This cd is not worth thirteen dollars. It's not worth thirteen cents. There is nothing Nortorious about Lil Kim. I feel she is being very disrecptful to the wife (Faith) for using Nortorious. She is garbage and so is her music. Carl Thomas should not have wasted his time or his vocals to such a ridiculous project.
1,The best rap star,"My name is Elvira , Lil Kim is my one of the best female star.I like her knew CD because it has a lot greatest songs,such as Qwen B and more.thank you"
2,"........ITS NOTORIOUS, NOTORIOUS LAME THAT IS.........",I HAVE TO SAY THAT HER LYRICS ARE FUNNY AND SOME ARE TIGHT BUT SHE NEEDS TO GET BETTER WITH HER RAPPING SKILLS AND HER FLOW NEEDS IMPROVEMENT. ITS A-IGHT BUT SHE THINK THAT THAT BODY IS GONNA SELL HER BILLIONS OF ALBUMS.
1,Horrible,"What a waste of money. I thought this chick a least changed up from the first album, but come to find out it's the same old corny Kim. Her first album was good most likely because of Biggi; this trash here took two years to come out and is no better than her first album. Her vulgar languge should have changed up too by now. Stay away from this album; it's the same old crap."
3,LIL KIM! the notourious K.i.m.,"this album was ok. The tracks were a little to weird for me but thats just me. I definetly advise that u buy this cd used, it is definetley not worth the $16.99 i paid . Dont let some of th e major singles off this album fool you. This is not one of kims best efforts . this is how each of her albums rate :1.the naked truth2.hardcore(her fist album)3.la bella mafia4.the notourious K.I.M"
2,Lyrics sounds Familar?,"Maybe its me , but some of the lyrics on this cd sounds very familar. Maybe from Biggie. Lil' Kim, I love because you are the boldest sista I've seen. You have really started a trend. But, this album is not good. The lyrics are childish and some are taken from Biggie(If you think I'm lying check out the ""Ready to Die"" cd). The beats are too poppy, the production could have been a lot better. Also, on your song ""Hold on"". You said that People are making money off of Biggie's death, but I think you and Puffy seemed to have profit too off his death . If people concern you ""The Best Female Rapper "". Show them why. I recommend some real female MC's: Rah Digga, Eve ,and Sonja Blade."
4,"Oh, Please She's Great! Get Over Jill Scott!","Lil' Kim, granted, is not a great rapper or artist, but so what?She has more (guts) than anyone I've heard, and she should be appeciated just for that. The fact that some of the reviewers were offended by her language is hard to understand. Here's a word of advice: If you see a parental advisory sticker on the cd that probably means there are going to be some dirty words on the cd. (...) As for the music, it is not as good as ""Hardcore,"" but it's satisfactory. The music is sort of retro and derivative, but I defy anyone not to dance to ""How Many Licks,""""She Don't Love You,"" and ""No Matter What They Say.""Unfortunately, Grace Jones is underused and the rumored track with Rupaul is missing, but I would buy this album (...) Lil'Kim, like Madonna, is not a great technical musician. (...) Kim's artistry lies in her ability to piss people off, which she has obviously done. Good for her! (...)"
4,4 and 1/2 stars,"Eventhough Kim's album was pushed back, it's tight. The CD is bangin'. Tracks 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,and 16 are my favorites. That's almost all the tracks. She disses Shyne and Foxy on N.O.T.O.R.I.O.U.S. K.I.M. Buy this CD now. It does contain extreme, nasty, and super explict lyrics."
4,A Must Have for Summer 2000,"The wait is finally over, and the Queen Bee reigns supreme like many of us hoped she would. This CD has some of everything on it, and the beats are unlike anything I would have expected from her. ""No Matter What They Say"" is a definite hit, but ""Don't Mess With Me,"" ""Who's Number One,"" and Tracks 4 and 7 make this CD hot."
3,not a bad effort,"First off, I think some people definitely need to settle down... Lil' Kim is not ""wicked"", nor are people who listen to her music... people are going to enjoy what they want to, regardless of what others think. I don't think I'm going to hell just because I like Lil' Kim... hahaAnyway, this is a pretty decent album... I like Lil' Kim a lot- next to Missy, she is one of the most talented female hip hop artists left. While this album has a bit more of a pop-ish feel to it then her first, it still certainly deserves some respect. I remember buying it when it first came out and thoroughly liking the beats.'No Matter What They Say"" is straight up a great song, along with 'Dont Mess With Me,' 'Hold On,' and 'Notorious Kim.' Can't forget 'How Many Licks?' too.Overall, it's not her best album... I'd say Hardcore or almost even her latest, Naked Truth, are better... but still a good buy for new Lil' Kim fans."
1,One Big Trick,Just what is Her Musically Purpose? She is Not a Good Rapper&that is a Reach.RUn Of The Mill Production&Material that it shouldn't have taken 4 years too follow-up with.Unlike 3 years back Puffy can't save Her.I Got too Hear this For Free&I Still wanted My Money&Time Back.if She wants To Be The Madonna of Rap She has alot of Work to Do.first You Have to Have Catchy Material&Not Bite&Make Such Lame Music.She is More Hype than She is Worth!
4,As Long as There's a Lil' Kim People are goping to Hate,"Lil' Kim's new CD Notorious K.I.M. shows her musical growth as well as her smooth attempt of targeting a wider audience. Some of her songs don't have the proper production to help her go in the direction she's trying but for the most part this album is tight. She's still hardcore and nasty but she's also more lyrical and versatile on this album. For those who say she still talks nasty on this album... big deal! I don't see anyone critisizing Too $hort for talking about pimping hoes on all 10 of his albums, so whats the difference. Lil' Kim this album is tight and as long as theres going to be a Lil' Kim there are going to be haters. And like your first single says ""No matter What People Say..You got it going on..Who cares about what they think..you are the number one"" obviously- haters check the billboard!"
2,Anticlimatic.,"I know I initially raved about this album, but I'm liking it less with each listen. First of all, this CD was LONG. At over 70+ minutes, I swore this record was never going to end. It just kept dragging on and on and on. Add to this the second-rate material that pervades much of ""the Notorious KIM."" I dug ""Lil Drummer Boy,"" as well as the faux-Latin flava of ""No Matter What They Say."" ""How Many Licks"" was also not half-bad, even with its cameo by Sisqo. After that...what else? There's too much filler on this CD, and it became a near-grating experience. This CD was released 4 years since her debut, and in those 4 years she had ample opportunity to come up with a WAY better record than this. Kim still has the skills. Now she needs the jams to complement her. Will she do better on her next CD? Time will reveal."
2,Notoriously B-A-D,Say what??? this is baaad music. I meant bad as in bad. Bad as in who thinks this is music.Bad as in who buys this music?
1,well she looks good,"I really do love Lil Kim but sometimes i can't understand why anyone thinks she can rap. her personality' fashion , looks , charm all get 25 stars but i struggle to give her a 1 star for her skills on Notorious kim hardcore or anything else she's ever done. If your just a wigger like me who love femal rappers check out anything by MIA X."
1,Do the '20 Bucks in the 8 Year Old's Hand' Test...,"...that is, what do you think an 8 year old with 20 bucks and a portible CD player gonna buy? (What did you think I meant?) That's the secret the record producers/promotors don't want you to know... But, it makes it easy for you to determine what to buy for yourself, especially if you ain't nowheres near 8 years old...what's unfortunate is that Lil Kim will sell millions of these while the supertalented like, f'instance Di Reeves or TK Carter, can't even get airplay."
3,Fun but lacking,"I'll put it this way; Lil' Kim has not changed one bit. NOTORIOUS KIM still has the same nasty ""easy girl that could"" lyrics and sentiments that thrived on Hardcore. Unfortunatly this time around they are far from fresh. What was shocking in 95' is stale in 2000. Da Brat most recently and many others riped pages from Kim in turn wearing out the ""nasty girl with a heard of gold"" routine. Due to the fact that Lil' Kim is at her best when she is talking trash it hurts this otherwise fine album. Though I suggest you pick it up if you at all enjoyed Hardcore cuz Kim beats are as solid as ever."
2,its all about what you like,"If you are a little kim lover, then this is for you. Just like her original album, she displays a raw attitude about men, money, clothes and sex. This CD gives us a look into Kim's life, and displays some things we rather not know. Some of the beats are fresh and new, and there are some things borrowed also (samples). This CD is definately ""out there"" and will definately shock."
4,Great Album!,"Contrary to what Time Magazine said about this album, I still think that its a great album. Lil' Kim IS the queen bee in the rap industry. Her husky voice, tight beats, and hard core lyrics are present in this album. She also compiled songs with a lot of people such as Sisqo, Mary J. Blige, and Puff Daddy. Overall, a great album! I would recommend it to anyone who loves rap music."
4,The Queen Bee Stings Again!,"Lil' Kim's album has finally dropped! After pushing her albumback time after time, i was finally able to pick up this disc as agift for my honey..I am not a real big K.I.M. fan, but some tracks were pretty hot. ""Custom Made,"" which features some porno vocals in the background, is pretty good. Also ""How Many Licks"" ftg. Mr. Thong Sisqo is steamy & sexy. The track, which is also her first single, ""No Matter What They Say,"" combines several different samples which gives you a catchy song to sing-a-long to. One track, ""Queen B--ch pt.2"" features P- Diddy, he ruins the song with his opening verse, which seems to never end...My girl seems to like it so yours will probably to, I just hope she don't wanna reinact some of K.I.M.'s hoeish stories...For me I'll stick to Too $hort if I wanna hear about pimps and hoes...."
4,"Good, clean fun.","Well, not really, but two out of three ain't bad. Clean just isn't a word in Lil' Kim's vocabulary. Let me first say that I'm really not one for rap music. I have heard a few rap songs that I like a lot. ""I'm That Type of Guy"" by LL Cool J is one example. But typically I find it repetitive with not much going on musically, and nothing much more than posing going on lyrically. I was pleasantly surprised by this disc. There seems to have been a lot of care taken in doing something different musically. The raps themselves, well, some of them would make Larry Flynt blush and did me as well, but she's definitely good and comfortable with what she does. Personal favorites are ""How Many Licks?"", ""I'm Human"" and ""She Don't Love You"". If you like rap, you'll probably really get into this. If you don't, give it a try. You may be surprised."
5,Lil' Kim's STILL the Queen B!,"Personally, I was going through Lil' Kim withdrawal waiting for the release of this CD. This girl has got it all!!! She IS without a shadow of a doubt THE BEST female rapper out there now and that I've EVER heard in my time (for the record, I'm 29 years old). This Girl just continues to blow my mind with her nasty (in a good way - at least to me) lyrics. I thought I was in love with the first CD but this one is truly incredible. It was WELL worth the wait. My favorite tracks are Who's Number One?, Aunt Dot, How Many Licks, and Hold On - her duo with the diva Mary J. Blige. And, I'm Human shows how versatile she can be. I'm so... impressed that she's written EVERY lyric in EVERY song on this CD. Something that we don't find nowadays in rap. I recommend this CD with all my heart and sould. I love you Lil' Kim!!"
3,Lil Kim not so big,"This new cd is good, but only if you are a fan. I am not exactly a fan of Lil Kim's music, more a fan of her, and her body, and her sexual style. If you are interested in her for the same reasons, I suggest that you simply buy this cd and look at the pictures."
2,Need more topics than just sex,"Although I only heard one song (which I do not like at all) I can only hope that Lil Kim can prove to me that she HAS grown from the last album and can deliver just as well as her deceased boyfriend, protege, father-figure, and everything she claimed he was. To me, if it wasn't for the fact that Biggie had anything to do with career, she would be nothing without him. But, hopefully, she can prove me wrong as long as she uses real lyricism."
2,wanna be divia,i thought the album was alright to explict even for me but she has had better albums in the past. you don't have to shell out so much to get your message across. and too much of her album revolves around sex and profanity. turst me she ain't the bomb!
5,Buffalishas,im sorry but im new to this and i havent heard it yet but woild like details on all new artist all Rap & RnB so i can buy cd's before there in the shop
2,Kim could do better,"Lil' Kim should go back to the M.A.F.I.A. This album shows how much she depends on other artists, and how poorly she can do performing solo. There are a few good songs on the album but they don't outweigh the bad (why did you bring back Puff Daddy's 80's cover material again?). Lil' Cease does a nice job letting us know he's still out there though."
3,yo i don't mean to hate on lil kim,yo i don't mean to hate on lil kim but it's just her lyrics r so wack. i mean if u a lady u might like hearin bout male parts the whole song but afta a while it gets nasty. her hit song no matter what they say is the best song by far. it's just that's the only song that i can stand listenin to besides who's #1. hey and this goes out to notorious: REST IN PEACE PLAYA. peace out.
1,Weak,"I can't believe so many people purchased this weak album. Her first album was ok probably because of Biggi, but this new album which took two years to make don't even come close. She should have grown up from the first album but she's still nasty as ever and un-listenable. People keep your money."
1,NOT REALLY CLEAN!!,"This CD has some good songs on it like Little Drummer Boy, Who's Number One and more but it also has songs that are really nasty like Ant Dot wich is about murder and How many Licks"
2,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"All I can say is this, Foxy Brown's new album Broken Silence is a classic and far superior production wise and lyric wise. Kim fell of completely with this album, lost her street credibility and proved without a shadow of doubt that she is nothing but an over rated fashion statement. Tracks like ""No matter what they say"" proved that she is trying to be too damn commercial and in her attempt to crossover,she has lost many many fans, mainly me. I was so dissapointed when I heard it. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by listening to it a few times but I just can't stand listening to it. I gave my copy of The Notorius K.I.M. away and after listening to Foxy' Brown's new one, I realized who the doper lyricist is and it ain't Lil Kim. Don't waste your money on what has got to be the wackest albulm from a female MC in a long time."
2,Lil Kim Sucks more Than usual,"Lil Kim was good back in 96 but now with Eve, Rah Digga , Sonja Blade and the Brat, That BS style she has, sucks. Yeah everyone has their own style but little Kim sucks right now. She talks about people makin money off of BIG but who's album reflects that. Who sample his voice on tracks, who talks about him on tracks, you are not the female BIG. She does not spit flame. She need to improve. The Scorpion album and The Sonja Blade album will prove that. Throw this Cd in the air and ""BANG, BANG"" and watch it fall to pieces like JUNIOR MAFIA. BRistal, Lil CEase and VICKY BANger , ya'll suck. ONe"
4,She Don't Love You,"I enjoy this CD. The songs are fun. Lil' Kim exudes raw sexual power. It's androgynous thrusts may not be sensual but they have lust. This stance would be only vapid posing if not for the songwriting skill. Lil' Kim displays a wide range of styles. Of course, there is the brash, in-your-face with her favourite body part songs, however, there are also sentimental fluff for the timid, and even a bit of gospel as she recites Psalm 27. Lil' Kim faulters a bit in her delivery, though, because her vocals often miss the beat, losing their needed forceful punctuation. Compared with her other skills, that is indeed a small sin, and can be overcome easily enough with practice. If you are interested in female rap music with strong sexual overtones, or if you are interested in music with a good beat that is fun, this CD will be interesting to you. Lil' Kim, stay away from my man. ;D"
1,Notorious W.H.A.C.K.,"A hip hop sin was committed when they let Kim name this album. One word to describe her music is 'trash'. Lil Kim has and always will be a whack rapper. She is nothing more that rapping about diamonds, versacci, and drug dealing. No originality, nothing noteworthy, just another boring CD brought to you by Puff Daddy which real hip hop fans will hate but little wannabes will enjoy."
1,Lil' Kim...notorious for making horrid music.,"Biggie put her on the map. Why, i'll never know. So she sucked off the fame he gave her (not the only thing she's been sucking) Also, being a Biggie fan, the name of this cd (proving my point about Biggie) was offensive and disrespectful. This is not rap, this is pop. If you think this is rap, you need to get smacked with a ""The Lost Children of babylon"" album and learn real rap. Nothing but two dollar trash by a two dollar wh*re."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"MAybe this album was supposed to give ehr more cross over appeal..but it hink this was a terrible attempt at any such things..This album is very disco ..hip hop..and little bit of pop.there are a few notable mentions but besides this she could have kept these lyrics and songs all to her self.The songs.""Lil Drummer Boy"" is alright and makes a good start to the album.The songs ""hold On"" featuring Mary is a good song talking about BIG..a great GREAT attempt to show her softer side, ""No Matter What They Say""..""Suck My D**k"", ""How MAny Licks"", ""Revolution"", ""She Dont Love YOu"" ,""Who's Number One?"", and ""Custom Made (give It To yOu)"" ae all worth mentions.But the rest of the album was mainly a waste of time..Im so glad she resurrected herself with ""La Bella Mafia"".If her third CD was anythin like this one.SHe would lost ALL street redibility..and there wouldn't be a LIL KIM for much longer!!!OVERALL GRADE 67/100 = D"
3,...Well...I was OK...not too impressed.,"I MISS THE OLD BIGGIE'S LIL' KIM!!!!! I don't know who this Lil' Kim is. I liked about 3 songs on the WHOLE ALBUM. Maybe 4. I miss the old Lil'Kim. I don't like this post-Biggie, Puffy Studio Remake."
2,Booo,"We all know what Lil Kim is about. This album seems to not know what it waants to be. Sometimes like it's going to be an experiemental piece of work. Sometimes standard hardcore hip hop. Sometimes x-rated pop. (...) Even the album cover is suspect. (...)..give her, her eye color back.There are a couple of decent songs on here. But most of them honestly fall short of what she started on her first album.I believe the combination of hard beats and nasty lyrics is what she's best at...and she's wavering all over the place in this one."
2,She Can Do Better,"Kim Jones can do better than this, check her verse on Quiet Storm which is by far one of her best displays of lyrical ability. I'm sorry, I still love Kim but this is not her best work.Jalonda"
2,buyer beware,Notorious kim is very wack. I was a fan up until this. There are only about two songs that I might consider playing in my car. Lil Kim has disappointed me with all this new beats that did not do anything for her type of rapping style.
1,2 dollar whore with a three dollar hairkut,"This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping."
4,A good read,"The book combines trial drama with psychological interest, both in the hidden past of the sketch artist and in profile of serial killer. Romantic angle involves female attorney who has to juggle romance with shady goings-on at prestigious firm. A very absorbing read."
5,Versatile -- ask me how!,"I tried this one day when the oldest of the grandchildren graduated from a tray on the high chair to table surface. It works like a charm in protecting the table from hazardous spills and can be washed for the protection of the user -- and the mat still has an ordinary day job! Got them for both my daughters-in-law, so this is a happy family. Now to bake some cookies..."
1,Use these if you want your baked goods to taste bad,"My wife and I were very excited to find silicone baking mats that were rated up to 500 degree. I like to bake my biscuits hot, and most baking mats are only rated up to 425. We purchased four of these. Two as a gift, and two for us.Well, I couldn't be more disappointed. Since we got these two months ago, we've baked mulitple batches of biscuits, cinnamon roles, cookies, and rolls and everything is imparted with a distinct chemical flavor. It's kind of soapy, but even after we wash with just hot water instead of using soap.These are a terrible disappointment. Do not buy these. We'll just have to put up with are other 425 rated baking mats until the world comes out with something that works."
4,"Interesting, but not a replacement for foil","I don't know anyone who uses this type of thing, so I relied on Amazon reviewers...good feedback so I tried it.I've been able to cut down on foil use quite a bit, and things don't stick, but this does stain (doesn't affect performance), there's no good way to wash it in the dishwasher (it's too flexible to get all sides clean), and it certainly doesn't catch grease the way foil does. It does have it's uses, and I'm sure I'll find more, but I'm not running out to buy these in all shapes and sizes."
3,Good item for some purpose.,"I would have liked to know the THICKNESS of this product befor purchasing it. I use this type of product to protect my Quartz Countertop. The color is great but it would have been perfect if the thickness was 1/16"" thick.I'm still looking some larger silicone mats 1/16"" thick for my countertops."
2,Disappointed,It's OK. My Sheltie had fleas and we tried getting rid of them with Ark Naturals - Neem Shampoo and Spray and they wouldn't die.
3,Lack Luster,"Not impressed at all. In the realm of new age, this is old hat. I wish I'd listened to the samples before buying but I went with the positive reviews. The pauses between tracks are too long and the music it self is lack luster."
5,The Best in the World,"I heard Medicine Woman many years ago while vacationing in the mountains of Tennessee but wasn't able to buy it. The melodies stayed with me for a year, when while at an Antique Show I stumbled across a small booth selling Indian artifacts. The owner was playing Medwynn in the background. I immediately begged him to sell me the CD, which he did, and I have since bought every CD available. There is no other music in the world that has touched my soul the way Medicine Woman has. Truley amazing!"
2,Gifted musician.,"Found this in a cut out bin for a quarter... oh wow.I won't begrudge the people that gave this cd 5 stars, because I'm sure they must have good memories associated with it, or something to that effect. Maybe they equate it things like that comfortable, beat up coat or that ratty pair of shoes everyone seems to have and love. Your girlfriend frowns and tries to throw them away, but you dig them out of the trash everytime. I mean there has to be some sane reason why all these people gave it five stars...Ok, so if anyone has forgotten what NEW AGE sounded like in the late 80's through the 90's -- give this one a spin.There is enough quasi-traditionalist pablum here to give you incense and mullet flashbacks.I will gifting this cd like a fruitcake this year."
4,Blissful listening,"I first heard this album while on a long business trip in Malaysia. It was piped through the hotel's internal music system into my room early one morning. The unique blend of primitive and melodic sounds of ""Medicine Woman"" transported me to a blissful jungle scene. Soon after locating this album, I became hooked on Medwyn Goodall. Over the past two years I have purchased eight of his CDs. I play his CDs during my workshops and seminars, and many people comment on where they can find his music."
4,Just what I wanted-soothing music,"calming, soothing music. Great for background while surfing the web or otherwise. Gladly recommend this music to anyone looking for this type of feeling"
5,healing music,"About four years ago,I came across this album in a used cd shop and was also struck by its colorfull cover and the hint of its content. Listening to it has lead me to invite friends to hear it and lead them to appreciate it as myself. Now, I have six of his titles, each has its own appeal. This album is one of his best efforts. What it leaves you with is a sense of inner peace and a healing just took place without you asking for it! At this time of society`s crazed disfunction, you need a source for healing in whatever form it comes in. Medwyn came through for us all and I thank him for it. Sometimes I think it was Spirit that led me to that cd shop because I needed this. I would also recommend ""Moon Goddess"" also look at the `New World Company` as there are many artists that are worth a listen."
2,"Hack, no talent. This is what gives New Age a bad name","The first hint that this guy has little talent can be found in the enormous amount of material that he releases. Thsi guy turns out music like Jimmy Dean turns out sausages. This is hokey, bombastic, hack music. Medicine Woman? Let's pander to the goofiest New Agers, eh? I doubt that any of the reviewers who praised this album would trust their health to some backwards medicine woman instead of modern health care givers - especially when they hear that the average Native American Indian looked like an old crone by age 30 and was usually dead by 35. This junk is what gives New Age a bad name."
4,Haunting like a Chagall; Deceptively brilliant like Couperin,"Anton Vowl, the story's focus, is missing and his friends must unravel the mysteries of his diary. This may sound like a pretty average premise, but neither Vowl, his frends, or their creator are average themselves. One immidiately notices the strange feel this book has--it hasn't a single ""e"" anywhere in the text"
2,Take my vowel. Please.,"Man, this book was painful. Once the find-the-""e"" game gets stale (about page 8), the rest of the novel is a tedious exercise in literary masochism. The only thing more amazing than the fact some guy wrote a book without using the letter ""e"" is that another guy came along and translated it into English. Even Perec himself apologizes for how boring it is, telling the reader by page 190 or so that he would be surprised if anybody made it that far. Well I did. And I've come back alive to tell you it's not worth it."
1,Big Regrets one year later,"I purchased this vacuum some time ago new. I have always owned and liked electrolux vacuums. This machine worked well at first, but so many parts are plastic (the wand) and over time it has lost suction. It barely works better then a dust mop. On another web site I discovered why this vacuum is a piece of junk... electrolux is not electrolux anymore. They sold their name to another company (eureka?). Anyway I will never buy another electrolux again. I bought a Miele and am very happy with it so far. My ""electrolux"" is going into the trash. P.S. Even new this vacuum did not work well on my hardwood floors."
4,Dork in Disguise,"Did you ever think you would have the chance to read a great book for teenagers.Well,now's your chance!!This is about a totally huge dorky guy named Jerry.He had bright orange hair and very dumb looking glasses but he threw away his glasses so he could look cool for his new school.He was about twelve years old and in 6th grade.Jerry tried to be cool in his new school so he wouldn't get picked on anymore.He was very likable.A lot of people would be friends with him. Jerry was very friendly and wasn't mean. He liked people that were intelligent but now he was looking for some cool group to join in. In this story he is doing some serious lying and crazy stuff! READ TO FIND OUT!!YOU GUYS SHOULD READ THIS STUFF.IT'S VERY HILARIOUS!! AND IT'S FOR TEENAGERS!!!"
5,A dork,"The main character I am writing about Jerry and he is about 12 years old and he is in the 6th gerade.He had glasses, wore ripped jeans and he had a shirt to make him look cool, but Brenda, his friend, thought that he needed lessons on acting cool.He lied to his friends when he started school and fell in love for the first time.He wanted to change his look from a dork to a cool kid to have Cinnamon for a girlfriend, but the suprise is that he chooses Brenda instead of Cinnamon at the end.He likes the smart people and he likes dorky people, too.He was changing. He looked cool finally, but he did not really succeed at being cool for the ""in crowd"".I liked it a lot and I think that if you read it, you will like it, too."
3,a cool dork,"This book is inturiging. It talks about a dork becoming a better person. This book is for all ages. If you are a dork, this book is HIGHLY recomended. It gives you clues on how to become cool. So kids read it now!Aaron,Dustin"
5,wide angle lens,great lens.. clean crisp photos and a super wide angle... pictures look awesome after they are cropped...47th street photo is a great seller to deal with.. very fast and very helpful in fixing a problem that I created with the wrong model number.Highly recommend Amazon.com & 47th street photo...
3,angry emo,"With Long Knives Drawn, Rainer Maria has turned down a dark alley. The female singer (of the once often duo), Caithlyn De Marrais, has gone basically solo (and should probably date Thom Yorke or hang with Jagged Little Pill circa Alanis). Long Knives Drawn is an exploration of a woman's unfulfilling relationship(s). Her voice is alone (""I was thinking we could go and live in a monastery"") & drastically punk, the atmosphere dark and unsettling, the lyrics lacking the elegance and sensitivty of past recordings as in their (as of now) masterwork Better Version Of Me.Undoubtedly, though, the record IS well done, the gleaming guitar work reminiscent of the past, but in _this_ fore Rainer Maria will rain on your parade. (Hilites: Tracks # 2, 4 & 8.)"
4,"Perfect fit, high quality, but...","... for this price the item should have arrived sooner than the two weeks it took. Fabric feels like a giant paper towel and I'm a little uncertain about how waterresistant it really is. Because of the thickness of the material, it takes up my entire trunk after I've rolled it up off the car. This is more for a car cover than I've ever spent, so I hope it lasts longer than the year or two the others have lasted before tearing or losing elasticity in the hem."
5,Let's Roll !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My mother suffered a debilitating, adverse reaction to a medication which left her bed-ridden for months. With the help of this walker, she is slowly regaining her ability to walk.She was unable to use more traditional lift-and-scoot walkers; but now, rolls with ease around the house. While shopping, the seat provides welcomed relief when rest is required.I would recommend this product to anyone with family members who wish to regain their mobility and independence."
4,perfect cartooon for men,"I bought this set as a gift for my husband, who is a fan of gory cartoons. He loved it!"
4,dinosaurs,"I remember this show as a kid but since I've been watching it, the show isn't that funny as it was when I was a kid so I was kinda dissapointed."
5,Just as funny as it was years ago,"I used to have some videos of this series and cherished them.The show is so funny it had me laughing all night.Jim henson was a pioneer and it appears his son brian will carry on his legacy.The show is great for kids to watch.There is nothing in it that would be objectionable at all to parents.I especially like when they are watching TV and the show ask mr lizard comes on.Its a spoof of Mr Wizard the science program seen on nickelodeon awhile back.The spoof always blows timmys head off as mr wizard has him look in a jet engine or something like that.Mr wizard always says--Were going to need another Timmy""""This just cracks me up.Buy the set and enjoy"""""""
5,Great Series,"Dinosaurs is the first show I remember loving as a child. Once you hear not the mamma coming out of your television speakers a smile will come on your face. Someone rated this show poorly because it is liberal propaganda... the fact is it is simply a smart, satirical show which can appeal to both childern and intelligent adults. As biased as my revivew is, the other person's is much more... he simply assumed everyone is pro-war, pro-business, pro-big oil, and the fact is 68 percent of Americans aren't. The fact also remains that Dinosaurs can also be watched for a simple smile and a laugh if you wish to not read into it that much. Buy it and enjoy it."
5,Christmas gift,"This was my oldest son's favorite show when he was a small child. This wasn't on his gift list, but when I saw it here online, I knew I had to get it for him. I was correct in my decision!"
4,good times dinosaurs,yep good times watching an old school hit tv show. glad i found it availible on dvd- even if the region is reg 1 and my country (au) is reg 4 :( still lucky i got a multi region player.came in very good condition
5,Great show,"I was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to look and see if this show had ever made it to dvd; low and behold, there it was! I was seven when this show came out (wow, was it that long ago!?). It's a cute show, it was entertaining when I was a little kid, and now, as an adult, it's STILL entertaining (I hadn't realized how deep the show actually was). Anyhow, still good for all ages, and the lessons still apply to today's society."
5,Just as funny as I remember.,"I remember as a kid watching this show and loving it. It was one of the only shows my family would intentionally try to never miss an episode. I loved it then and now seeing it all over, I still love it."
5,a great fun show,"i never actually seen this untill it got released on dvd.i got the dvd, and then, i just LOVED it !it's funny, you can actually related to it without it being lamei loved it, and i recommended it to everyone who loves tv.now some of my friends and i watch the dvd togheter, so please, bringus more! :)"
4,awesome show,"this show is a classic, it's funny, cute and actually smart. i remember it well and being in front of the tv every week to watch it. the episodes all look just like they should (good). the only bad thing about this set is the extras..there aren't enough. you get the beginnings of how the show came to be, the suit people talking about what it was like being in the suit and that's about it. no interviews with the voices of the show or any behind the scenes stuff that you would want and the most disspointing thing is no commentaries. otherwise this is a set that you should really get and enjoy by yourself or with the family. this is good stuff for kids and adults..all you need is a sense of humor. anyone who says this show is bad and shouldn't be on dvd probably doesn't have a real sense of humor and likely doesn't even remember the damn show so don't waste your time on reading their stupid reviews. give it a shot and you will enjoy it."
4,He's the baby! Glad to see him!,"This show never got the attention that it deserved. My father loved it and quotes it all the time, so I was glad to be able to buy this complete collection for him. One simply cannot go wrong with the works of Jim Henson's crew. If you are looking for a show to share with your family, I reccomend this. It is a little bit Honeymooners, a tad Roseanne, with a dash of the Muppets."
4,Timeless,This was fun viewing and a great way to teach satire. The last two episodes of the second season are about war and your mouth will drop at the timeless metaphor and current relevance.
5,Absolutely classic!,"This was a favorite of mine wen it came out on TV all those years ago. I loved it. So when I heard it was coming to DVD, and I had to buy them. The characters were well written and acted, and the storylines were great. Each episode had a underlying story of some sort, and a message to pass onto the viewers. But unlike many sitcoms, the way it was presented was very different.As mentioned by a few other reviewers, Earl and Roy are very similar to the charcters from the Honeymooners. Whether they were modeled after them or not (pretty close), they were still different. So, to say this is a rip of that show, is vastly over simplifying things.I throughly enjoyed the show as I was perusing through the episodes, and managed to laugh at almost all of them. Other than Farscape, I cannot think of a better show using Jim Henson's puppets to this high degree of performance. The humor is still just as good today as it was then, and recommend getting this show to all."
3,Sometimes things change,"I remembered this program as quite funny, and thought I might like to see it again. Unfortunately, it wasn't as funny as I when I first watched it. I guess my taste in this comedic genre changed, as I am now planning to offer it up for auction at eBay. Maybe someone else will enjoy it more than I thought I would."
5,Excellent!,Everything was great! It was shipped fast and packages well. The item was just as it had been described. I couldn't be happier about the transaction. Thanks!
4,Dinosaurs - The Complete First and Second Seasons,"The DVD's was new as promise, and I was very satisfied with the delivery time the next day."
4,Enjoyed it again,I watched Dinosaurs when it first was on television. I very much enjoyed watching it again with my children. The older two (17 & 19) were amazed at the adult humor they missed the first time they watched the show when younger. The youngest (9) was enthralled by the show.
5,Dinosaurs - How we miss Jim Henson,"It's obvious that Jim Henson was a master puppeteer. I myself am a fan of The Muppet Show, Muppets Tonight, Dinosaurs, and most of the Muppet Movies. If you loved the television show Dinosaurs, you'll love this dvd. It has some interesting extras as well. You can learn about their idea for the sitcom and how they put it into action. Enjoy!"
4,Great price,Really good saw for the price. Has plenty of power and easy to control. Great gift to get someone you know.
1,What a disappointment,"The price seemed write, but now I realize it's not worth it at any price. I found it made of cheap plastic, and the alignment doesn't even amtch with the blade. Please, please, please don't but this saw. Looks like I'm still in the market for a lightweight circular saw. I finished my project with my old ryobi 18 V saw and tossed this garbage saw in the corner of my garage."
2,not a good saw,"My advice is to spend more money, and get a better saw. I wasted my money, save yours."
3,Worked well for about 2 hours -- but not a major issue,"As the headline indicates, this saw proved effective at cutting wood for about the first two hours of run time -- after that, it failed miserably. However, after initial anger wore off, I realized the problem was that the blade bolt just needed to be tightened down. Back in action. That said, with the bolt having been initally tightened down according to spec, it should not have loosened up so quickly in my opinion."
3,Skil saw,"I am currently deployed ISO OEF and didn't want to bring my Dewalt saw. I want to say that it is a quality product for the price, again for the area that I am at."
4,Great saw,Our son asked for a circular saw on his Christmas list. He was delighted with the one above. It fulfills all his needs and expectations.
3,Bulky,"I wanted a saw for light use, essentially for limited residential use. While this is a good and powerful saw, I find it to be somewhat bulky. Also it was tough to cut straight, you only have the benefit of a mark in the front and not the back to make straight cuts."
5,Great Saw for the buck!,"I purchased this saw for my guy for Christmas a year ago. Although he hasn't got much use out of it, when he has used it he liked it. It's heavy and seems to be able to handle anything you try to cut with it. I was a little leery about getting a refurbished one, but that hasn't seemed to make any difference. I'll definitely buy refurbished to save money in the future as they seem to work just was well as a brand new product!"
4,"If it is stalling out, tighten the blade.","Spent a lot of time trying to make this saw cut through simple things (like 3/4 inch plywood) and it just wouldn't work for us, even after buying new blades for it. Goes in a few inches and stalls out, blade just stops turning. It starts up fine, spins for a little while, but doesn't seem to have enough power to make it through normal treated plywood. Pretty big disappointment considering how positive all the other reviews are. The saw seemed very underpowered to us, so much so that we couldn't use it on even basic projects around the house (making plywood boxes for gardening and compost.) Not sure if we got a flukey one or what.Update: After some more troubleshooting it turned out the blade was just loose somehow, even though it was running it took forever to get up to speed. If this happens take the blade housing apart, reassemble and tighten everything. Once this was fixed the saw worked fine!"
2,Short life. Semi OK price.,"These break at the valve stem or handle. All of the plastic ones I tried have, this one included. Perhaps if you only plan to use it for a short time it would be OK but an all brass one will last much longer."
3,Cut small,"Nice fabric and seems to be well made. I won't be wearing mine, though, as it's cut overall too small. I wear a 44 reg. jacket and generally wear a Large in shirts. This one is too narrow in the chest, but I think the XL sleeves will be too long. So, maybe OK for the skinnier guy."
3,cuffs are undersized,I like the quality of the material and the weight. Overall the tailoring is first rate but the cuffs are much too small. Even on the outer button there is not enough room for me to check the time on my wrist watch without unbuttoning the cuff. Somewhat like the Italian bicycling jerseys with tiny arm holes and cut for narrow shoulders. Anyone with large wrists will not even be able to button the cuffs at all. Too bad someone screwed up on this important detail as otherwise the shirt is great. Back to LandsEnd I guess.
5,Riggs workshirt,"Durable quality yet comfy work shirt. We ordered two and will order more. Husband usually wears a large, but we bought the XL, and it's just right. Stylish and functional--appears to be long lasting, too."
5,great casual workshirt,"My husband lives in denim...shirts and jeans. These are heavy duty winter shirts.good quality and simple style. You can trust the Wrangler name, I have found."
4,Extremely helpful as a research tool.,"Eisler's collection of pieces from The Lowell Offering is arranged in a user-friendly manner, but is limited in its content. If one cannot get one's hands on the original publications, however, this work is a great stand-in. Highly recommended as a research instrument, as articles are fully footnoted."
2,Wrong fit,"Ordered it. Too long to get. And, it didn't fit my 2003 Avalanche. My mechanic got it to work, but it's not great as a bug deflector. Definitely, don't recommend it for the truck I have."
5,Great CD,"I don't usually listen to hardcore music, but this CD really is amazing and great for anyone. The guys can really play their instruments and it's obvious from the energy of the CD that they love what they're doing. The lyrics range from fun to profound. Pick up this CD if you're looking for something new. You won't be let down."
4,Great for Boys,"I bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas. He was very excited to get started. There are nearly 90 steps to complete the International Space Station. He finished it in two days, (I hoped it would take longer) and plays with it daily. I would highly recommend this product. It will provide hours and hours of fun for your 9 to 12 year old."
5,A Lesson for Many,"Missing Michael is a heartwarming, courageous story that only a mother could tell. Sleepless nights combined with perfunctionary days are many, yet perseverance, rapport, and therapeutic normalcy become the frosting on this cake. I recommend Missing Michael not only for families experiencing epilepsy, but for others who may someday find themselves raising, educating, or treating children with physical and emotional challenges."
5,Even the grill master loved the book!,"After researching barbeque/grilling books, I bought both my father and my husband this book for Christmas. My husband uses his grill about 3 times a month, but my father is our ""grill master"". For years, he fires up his grill at least 3 times a week. When he opened the book, he just gave us a polite 'thank you' and seemed kind of disappointed. However, he called me last week to tell me he started reading it. He thinks the book is fantastic! It is enjoyable to read, and he has a better understanding of what works, what doesn't, and why. My husband and I cooked a prime beef tenderloin on the grill last weekend. We followed the advice in the book, and finished product was amazing!"
5,"6,000 Fires!!","The Penultimate review book on the different ways to BBQ all kinds of meat/fish/fowl, etc. They literally try every single way something could be cooked outdoors and tell you which work and which do not work. Large, red hardback book. I used a yellow hi-liner through out the book b/c it is just too informative."
2,"If you really want to stay alive, don't count on it","I realy don't know what to say , but if you want to stay alive while you mamaging the sql ,and this is the only book you got, you better send help to somebody who really know SQL. This is not the book you thought."
4,Good book for anyone converting from 6.5 to 7.0,Clearly written and concise with lots of useful examples
1,little useful information beyond the SQL Books on Line,"Unlike some other SQL Survival books, which can save your neck (such as the SQL 6.5 Unleashed) this book is not very helpful in real world situations. It regurgitates the Books on Line (with the occasional ""real-world"" tidbit) and offers little new or relevant information. It might be helpful for studying for an exam, but if you are trying to perform a real task, it's not very useful. It feels as if it were written before it was actually used, which is probably correct, given its publishing date."
4,Essential for new and seasoned SQL 7 users!,"This book has saved my butt while I was having trouble during version 6.5-to-7 upgrading, ODBC Unicode and language headaches and while trying to understand proper application of transactional replication. The sections od database design are very good. As a DBA for a major Turkish user of SQL 7, this book is a good reference. I first look at it before calling online help. It lacks a bit on low-level details when compared to ""Inside Microsoft SQL Server 7"" by Soukup and Delaney. But, the language here is more business like rather than technical."
1,Wrong size!,"The item is great just that the listing did not specify the correct size. This is for king cabs short bed at 77"". Not the 69"" that it says in the description and sizing chart."
5,GREAT,"I've had my polar heart rate monitor for over 2 years now and it still works great! It tells how many calories you burn in a workout session so that you can better calculate you calorie needs during the day. The more you work out-the more you can eat! With the help of this watch and my LoseIt app, I lost over 45 lbs!Great product!"
2,Something is missing...,"I have to say that unless you had a subscription to this series that it would make absolutely no sense to purchase this volume.First off, this book has 3 chapters: 18, 19, 20.TITLES:Ekans in EcstacyThe Kindest TentacruelHitmonlee, BabyCute titles. Which are accompanied by cute artwork. Unfortunately they aren't accompanied by a discernible plot. For example, chapter 18 begins with a Yellow introducing himself. Then in the next panel we see small Pokemon skittering away. Third panel has unknown characters saying, ""What the --?""Then a battle ensues. No explanation for why or even who.All in all it was not a satisfying read. Even given that the motivation of the characters might be understood by others, there was just too little material covered in this book. The story didn't advance at all. And in fact, I'm guessing that a child would likely outgrow the series before it got to a conclusion.Pam T~"
1,These don't work,"If you need a laxative for real dont buy this.-For me to generate the movement I had to take between 5 and 10 pills per day, and I was going to the bathroom normally. Nothing out of the ordinary. Once I took this dose twice in a day, and finally got what I wanted.-100 softgels will last 1 week, not worth it!"
4,Excellent product but excessive shipping cost,"The product is excellent but the shipping cost is exhorbitant, costing almost as much as the product. I ordered two thinking it would lower shipping, but shipping was charged for both,"
2,It did not help me.,"In my case it did not work. But in fairness,none of the otherstool softeners worked either.I discovered that a glass of prune juice with barley crumbs(once a day,afternoon)is the remedy for my relief.I am very happy now."
4,Stool Softener,"The items came in a timely manner. Exactly what I expected in the product. Unfortunately, I did not receive an invoice."
3,enchanting fairy tale-like novellas with a dark side,"This is a different pace than his other books b-c it's broken down into quick-read novellas. You sink into an almost childlike world of characters whose consuming faith in one thing allows them to create their own imaginary realities. There are so many little kingdoms within each story, and it evokes a feeling of wonder. I only gave it a 3 b-c I liked some of his other books better, but this book was really interesting, deceptively simple. Also, I disagree with the first reviewer who said the last story was a bore. It was a different pace, but I could really visualize each painting he described. It encourages the reader to use his or her own imagination"
4,great novellas,"the three novellas in this book are all very different in style and content, but written so cleverly. the 1st story is mesmerizing and the the 2nd - dark fairy story style is so surprising after it that i was instantly enchanted - loved it!"
4,Wonderful Movie: Question About DVD--Please Answer!!,"I do not have the DVD version, but this movie is excellent. I have been waiting for some time to see this out on DVD. The acting is superb and the setting adds to the story. This is a very character driven story. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys period romance.My main question for anyone who has purchased this is, does the DVD include a trailer? I have been desperate for years to figure out the music playing in the trailer. If anyone knows, please let me know!"
1,will not work on Windows 2000 or Windows XP,"Had to give a star to post this, but how can I give any stars for something useless to me?! During this sale I was lead to understand that this game was compatable with Windows XP. NOT!!!!!!!! According to the eGames site - ""the indiction on the box regarding the limitiation of it's compatibility to Windows 95 and 98 is accurate."" Needless to say i'm upset. Not a lot of money, but a lot of hassle!!"
4,Good saw for small projects,"I got this saw for small projects and it definitely gets the job done. As other reviewers have mentioned, I wouldn't cut anything more than 3/4"" pine. I didn't use the stock blade at all (I went with the Bosch blades) and it did just fine on 3/4"" MDF and Pine. As you'd expect there was a noticeable difference between the two, but you could tell the saw was struggling to get through the pine. If you have larger, more intense projects, I'd suggest getting a more powerful/expensive saw."
3,Not for thick material,I tried to cut a fairly flat curve on a 2x6 using this jigsaw (with a very good Bosch blade) and it was basically impossible.
2,Basic saw BUT DOES NOT HAVE THE FEATURES SHOWN IN THE VIDEO,The saw is a good basic unit BUT the Amazon video shows that it has an orbital cut setting and a laser cutting guide. IT HAS NEITHER OF THESE FEATURES!
5,Does What It Was Made To Do,"I like this basic jig saw. It works well at a reasonable price. I wish it came with a case, though."
1,Poor quality and definitely not an instructional video.,"The only thing this video has to do with the saltwater fly fishing is the fact that the instructor(name forgotten thank God)has a fly rod in his hand. Poor camera work, lots of local fish stories, but very little instruction on technique. I viewed this tape twice and felt this is a scam. Save your money and don't buy this one. Apparently Amazon has a very limited selection of videos on fishing instruction. Definitely not a Lefty Kreh video. One star is too high a rating. Can I get my money back"
3,Enghh,"I ordered this to re-mount a used backboard onto an existing 3.5"" pole I inherited with my house. The part quality is fine, and they ""technically"" give you all the parts you need, but the directions are anything but clear and they only give exactly the minimum parts (bolts/nuts/washers), so to actually install it well, you really will likely need some extras from a trip to your local hardware store. I ordered it as a used, but new part, so I'm not complaining. It was only $11-$12. It did the job, but it could've done it a whole lot better without a lot of extra effort. If you're handy, you'll do fine. If not, you'll be very frustrated."
2,Wrong screws sent,"I ordered this product and paid for overnight shipping so my son could have it before the weekend. It arrived as promised, however, when my husband tried to install it we found the screws were wrong. Not one of the screws sent to us matched up with the pre-drilled holes on the backboard. Nor do they match the pictures in the instruction manual. So, we're now left running to Home Depot to buy the right screws. Needless to say, I wouldn't purchase anything like this via the internet again."
1,Difficult,This is more than a pain to put together.It really is not sturdy at all with all the joints in it.Will be returning it.
1,This is not a universal kit.,"Beware! This is not a universal kit. The 2 main supports for roof mounting are not included. Here is a quote from the instructions ""Hardware for mounting brackets to the roof is not included.I called Spalding prior to purchase to see if it would fit my backboard and roof mounting and that said it would. What they didn't tell me is that I would need additional mounting hardware.This is very disappointing; I told my daughter I would have it up for her this weekend."
3,very confusing,"The picture of this bracket being used on a garage-mounted backboard is very misleading. The universal mounting bracket does not have enough parts to mount this backboard out far enough over the gutters of a house. The picture shows it mounted as such- but with close examination of the picture, there are actually two of these mounting brackets being used. So, if you are planning on ordering this bracket for wall-mount or pole-mount you will be fine. But, if you are mounting to a roof that has gutters that project out past the roof, you will need two of these brackets to mount as the picture shows. We ended up deciding the kids will screw up the house if they miss too many shots, so we just ordered a pole to put in the ground instead of another set of brackets. Found a great spalding pole for $87 on the walmart web site."
5,new brackett,Very easy to use and affordable. My grandson loves it and is now making better shots in basketball.games .just love it
3,not enough,if you're going to mount this on a roof that has a 12/12 pitch it might work but I had to rig it to work on the 4/12 garage roof. need over twice the angle bracket than what you get.
5,Made it through Sandy,"Seems like a good mount, probably better quality than the backboard itself.Would buy again, too bad its not height adjustable."
3,Read backboard directions first!,"Purchased bracket with Spalding backboard. After assembling and mounting the bracket and backboard on the garage, we found out that the holes for mounting the rim did not match up. On the backboard directions, the correct assembly instructions for the bracket were included. At that point we had to take the backboard and bracket down and re-assemble the bracket. The bracket works fine, but the directions need to be edited. Wasted hours."
2,Who designs these things?,There are two things wrong with this item1.) Universal is a very loose term here. If you have excellent spatial intelligence you MAY be able to figure out ways to mount your backboard to your pole after several hours of trying various things. When you do see the solution it will be less than ideal. I had supplement my own parts to make my backboard fit in the end.2.) There are not enough parts or bolts to do what you likely need to do. You may have to buy another mount set to get more of the parts you need or do what I did and find parts in your garage and from the original backboard mount you had.POOR POOR value for what you get.
1,Worst piece of Chinese junk ever.,"Ordered this product from Amazon. It is the recommended kit for the Spalding 79354 backboard. Almost at the point of sending both back. The holes in the kit do not even line up for a pole mount. I am going to have to drill new holes to make the angle pieces fit. Also, the angle pieces they ship do not line up either. The picture is wrong from the kit to the backboard(same company mind you with supposedly same instructions for pole mount). If you order this kit, make sure you are a handyman and can drill new holes...at least for a pole mount. You will have a good bit of drilling to do. If you order this kit, you might want to go the hardware store and buy new bolts and nuts. The ones included are Chinese crap that strip fast. The hardware store probably has Chinese crap but maybe a better grade of crap. My advisement is to buy a brand new everything(pole, base, and backboard) if you have a portable pole mount."
4,sturdy,"this seemed like an easy job but was a little confusing using the directions - there are 2 booklets. definitely two (moderately strong) people to actually put up the hoop with this, and 2 ladders. seems very sturdy once all the directions are figured out."
2,Bolts that break during assembly,The bolt that are included with the mounting kit aresub standard. Everytime I tightened a bolt to the hardware the bolt snapped off. I ended up buying stronger nuts and bolts from Home Depot to complte the job.
3,Didn't work for my Application,Thought it would cover all applications but my pole set up (25 yrs old) was not compatible.
2,Required some re-engineering.,This is the proper installation kit for this backboard. But the instructions are confusing.And some of the holes are drilled wrong. I had to cut one of the braces and re-drill a hole.It is almost impossible to install alone.
2,installation difficulty,"This product was extremely difficult to install. Some bolts interferred with other bolts or nuts going at 90 degrees from one another, blocking the nut from installation, without a lot of work. Also, because of this, a socket wrench could not be used on many nuts. Very frustrating and time consuming! I am hoping nothing has to be tightened after the backboard was installed above the 10' height, and between the house wall and the back side of the backboard."
1,Enormous PITA to assemble,"This item comes with an instruction book consisting of mostly drawings. There is no text of how to put this contraption together...no steps to take, no text on what is supposed to where...just drawings.It took 2 adults a half a day to assemble this thing (3.5hrs) and I was working with a ""professional"" handyman (a guy that makes his living being ""handy'). It takes 2 adults because it is kind of heavy and awkward to lift.Basically this backboard mount is just way too complicated for what it is. In the engineering field, it's called being over-engineered.Now I will say, on a positive note, that it seems to be rock solid and a stable mount for the poly-carb backboard, but it's a long, long way from being an easy, relatively simple, put together."
2,Not OK for all roof mounts,"If you're trying to mount a backboard on a low pitch roof and over a rain gutter, you will need lots more parts. Being a retired mechanical engineer with 40 years product design I headed to my nearest hardware store and purchased 18"" long angles and drilled them to fit. I used the included short angles to extend the support arms so they could reach my 3 pitch roof and hold the backboard vertically. Unless your roof is steep and there is no rain gutter, I suggest you don't buy this kit and head to your nearest hardware store (not a big box home improvement store) and ask for advice to complete this job."
5,Very reliable device and sturdy as well,"This is another Belkin product that is well made, sturdy, and performs exactly as advertised. It takes up very little room on my desk and is an essential item if you need additional USB ports."
2,Surges and drops connections when unplug something from it,"Kind of scary. Often, when I unplug one of the devices from this - after doing the ""safely remove hardware"" thing from windows, windows will report a power surge and stop seeing the other items on the hub. Two problems with this:1 I have to reboot to have the other USB devices be visible again.2 More scary, sometimes USB drives are destroyed when depowered suddenly. Not sure if that's the situation with this but don't want to risk it."
1,Did not work - had to return,"I purchased this item because I am pretty much using all my USB ports, and I liked the idea of having high-speed ports for my high-speed USB devices. When I plugged it in, not only did it not carry my keyboard or my printer (it was like they weren't plugged in at all), but it also killed my other USB ports -- none of them worked after I plugged it in -- even after I unplugged it. I have NO IDEA what happened but after I did a system restore to the previous day, and then did a reversal of the system restore, then I had my USB ports back. I couldn't print out my return label fast enough. I am fairly saavy when it comes to technology, and I can say I may never buy a Belkin Hub again. Bad experience for this first time Belkin buyer and full-time web developer."
1,Unreliable,"I purchased this product from a retailer, but returned it in favor of a 7-port StarTech hub from Amazon. As some other reviewers have noted (elsewhere on Amazon and on other ratings sites), this hub is unreliable. After a day or two, it dropped its connection to the computer, and I had to unplug the USB connection to get it to be recognized again.I borrowed a cheap USB 2.0 hub from a friend, and it worked fine, so I realized that the problem was caused by this hub and was not a computer problem. Belkin's only advice was that this hub might work if it wasn't connected to a surge suppressor. The explanation simply didn't jive with the facts, and removing a safety device seemed to be a ludicrous solution, anyway.They've lost my confidence...I don't recommend this product. There are cheaper, more reliable products out there. (So far, I'm very happy with the StarTech ST7200USB 7-port hub I got from Amazon.)"
2,Gradually died,"Had this for a year or so. It worked well at first.First one port died (nothing would work in it), then another, then another. At that point it's a lousy extension cord.I threw it out.Connected to an iMac G5, using keyboards, mice, iPhone, disk drives, audio/midi interface."
2,Unreliable and unpredicable performance,"When I first purchased this device (also from a retailer other than Amazon)I appreciated being able to use a mouse, an external hard drive, a keyboard and a set of head phones through my Belkin. Now, I have the exact problem described by reviewers even though my device is only about 6 months old. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Lately its been working less and less. There are 4 ports and each lights up green if it works. I started at 4 working when I purchased it, than went to three and now one works, on occasion. Sometimes you reboot and that helps. Sometimes it doesn't. Very unpredictable performer."
5,Great Product!,I've had my hub for about a year and never had any problems. I only wish I wish I had bought the larger one with 7 ports!
3,"Great Imagination, So-So Script","""Delgo"" features a wonderful, visually enticing world. There's a Star Wars/Dark Crystal vibe to the strange ecosystems and cultures that come alive in nearly every frame. I loved the computer animation, the details, and the textures. Unfortunately, the script could've used a little more fine tuning. It was almost there, and had some great elements, but had just a few loose nuts and bolts rattling through that kept it from purring along like it ought to have. One character in particular, Delgo's best friend Filo, really poisoned it for me: his overacting, Jerry Lewis-style antics, and general incompetence really didn't seem to fit the rest of the tale. It's still worth watching if you appreciate original, creative worlds and wonderful computer animation, but it's a little sad to think that it could've been better."
3,Deserved a better fate,"If I rated this movie by 1999 standards I would give it 3-4 stars, today 2-3. Granted the plot is rather derivative - but many fantasy action/adventure movies are, so I can give that a pass. Unfortunately the movie got delayed in production and as we know CG art ages like milk rather than wine, so it was 7 so years past by the time it hit the theaters. I believe the wisdom of hindsight would have been or them to release some shorts like Pixar did and not dived into the deep end on their first try."
2,Delgo - expected more,I was expecting an interesting movie what could be watched by adults and children. My assumption where wrong and I would say that the movie has too much fighting for the children and I quite boring for the adults. I was not impressed with the animation at all which has a 80's feel to it.Overall I would not recommend it worth keeping in a DVD/ Blueray collection.
4,Delgo,I really enjoyed this movie. My grandsons and I sat down to watch it and they liked it also. There is a little movie short that you should watch. i had not even heard of the movie before I found it on Amazon.
2,Great Graphics Poor Story,"Positive: Great graphics for background scenes and in particular for expressiveness and uniqueness of each character. This was accomplished on a low budget but with detail reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki. Too often voices are poorly cast for animations but in this case the voicing was well done and fit naturally to each character.Negative: The dialogue, script and storyline could learn much from Miyazaki. As others have noted the story is redundant and poorly developed; relying too heavily on graphics to carry the audience through. Some imagination in story & script development equivalent to the graphics would have carried this movie to a much higher level."
4,A great family movie,I really enjoyed this movie. It may have not made a hit on the big screen; but it sure made a big hit with my family.
4,impressed,"Quite a Epic of a movie for a animated one. The graphics are pretty good, thecharacters are plenty, and its good for the whole family. A familiar story ofGood against evil brings us to this world where they are trying to live in peacebut there's always someone's who wants WAR for their profits.Love the scenes where we see both armies...the computer animation is alwaysimproving. Im sure some will not like it...as in all movies, but for the onesthat like these kind of movies, i dont think you will be let down by this adventure."
4,Must See in Person,These sunglasses defintely make a statement. I own one of the few rare ones out there. They put on a show in the sun that is to die for. People usually wear them on there head to get attention. There a must see in person.
2,Phoney Sex Fantasy!!!!,"This book may be ok for a phone sex consumer or someone looking for a cheap thrill, but as a professional phone actress it was very disappointing. I had been looking foreward to getting this book and after reading it twice it went in the trash. Austin talking about getting hot and bothered with callers doesn't ring true in my experience or any of my acquaintances in the business. The most preposterous claim in her book is being successful with a character that is supposedly asian, but using a whiny New York accent. Several phone workers I know and myself as well, have asian and other ethnic characters, when clients call them they want an exotic experience and expecting a very genuine accent. Although Ausin's writing is adequate and even marginally witty at times, her accuracy and take on the business is very sadly lacking."
4,i went through this too,"yes i spent 12,000 on this in four years . now its just a regular chat line for me ..when i still use it. beautiful girls that you do not see. but hear . a web cam would be forbidden ."
5,Engaging and Amusing,"If you've ever wondered about the real world of phone sex operators and callers, this is a book for you.Miranda Austin gives the reader a wonderful voyeuristic peek at a profession most of us know little about. And even better...she does so with intelligence, humor and a keen eye for details. Whether you'd like to be a phone sex operator, or are just curious about what they do, this book is a terrific read.Ms. Austin shares the often peculiar details of human sexuality (her own as well as her callers'). I now have a good understanding of why someone would pay for phone sex and the mechanics of how the business works.But the best part of the book is Ms. Austin's infectious enthusiasm for her profession and her amusing, sexy, compassionate and often bizzare view of her clients.Rarely have I read something that turned me on, made me laugh and educated me at the same time. This book, in my opinion, is a wonderful and entertaining contribution to the knowledge of sexuality."
4,phone sex.,"very helpful, gives you a head start on the the phone sex buisness, helps you come up with ideas on topics to talk about."
4,Outstanding drama series,It's a shame that A&E cancelled any future episodes of this drama series. I personally thought it was very well done and held your attention through the entire hour. The cast was great and this series was based on true facts. The broad spectrum of characters that were addicted to drugs was so interesting. Made you realize that drug addiction is no respecter of persons. I recommend this two season series hightly.
1,Waste of money,Architecture Traveler is a waste of money . I bought it in hopes of getting guide to great new buildings in NYC . It did not have any and the guide to buildings in NYC was aweful . Buildings not listed by City but by year !!! Give me a break .
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this item a couple days ago to for the spare bedroom in the house, and all I can say is that this item is worthless. It looks cheap and it feels flimsy. As I was positioning the antenna to get a better picture one of the antennas broke right off. DO NOT BUY."
1,poor,"poor -- looks like it was jumped on to make it fit in the box , non functional - didnt work at all - i took it apart to find out why it didnt work and the inside was mangled , wires were not attached and suprised it didnt catch fire just floating around inside -- not worth sending back , postage is more than its worth"
1,Vegas Jackpot Gold: 325 Casino Games,Worst cd games I have ever tried. Sorry I bought it because it is a complete waste of money. Games are cheezy to say the least......terrible product I would never recommend anyone to buy it.
2,Berber women in question,"This work is flawed: the author presents life before French colonialism as authentically Algerian and doesn't even reference the history of the country as a product of Islamic/Arab and Ottoman conquest. She has a tendency to overuse phrases such as: 'Algerians thought that...' as if they were homogeneous. Worst of all she refers to Berberism as 'anti-Muslim and anti-Arab' -- twice, without even a variation of phraseology -- and that this phrase is the quite literally the only mention of the Berber people she makes within the whole post-colonial section of the book. For someone who claims to be filling the 'silence' this omission of the concerns of one third of the population is very telling.However, the sections dealing with post-independence legal changes are informative and useful."
2,There Are Better,"This book was a little run of the mill. The story sounded like it would be full of interesting stories, but it really did not rise to the occasion. This book is a review if the problems DBL had after their Junk Bond department ran into trouble with the SEC. The book covers the collapse as an overall review with not much new info that has not been shared in other books. The best part of the book was when the authors took to describing all the financial players involved, their egos, and ways of life and doing business. The excesses of some of the companies detailed are really something. If you are interested in this topic then I would suggest you also read ""Den of Thieves"" and ""Predator's Ball"", both of which cover the 80's M&A and Junk Bond world. To get a better understanding of KKR, I would suggest ""Masters of Debit"". They are much better books then this one."
3,Outdated Publication,"When I orderd this text, I expected a current edition, not the 1998 publication that I received. I seem to recall that the text was advertised as a recent publication but, unfortunately, I did not print the advertisement."
2,Dark & Boring,The Nutcracker Sweeties was weird and boring. Not very well filmed. The film was shot from a down angle which is not always a good angle to view dancing. Too much vamping done by the dancers. The Judas Tree was dark and depressing.
3,Just ok,For a tales from the crypt movie the story line nor the cast was very strong. Seen better from tales series.
2,Jennifer Grey In The Land Of Zombies...,"RITUAL isn't the worst voodoo movie ever made, but it's certainly got its problems. First off, it's a bit too long. At an hour and forty five (plus) minutes, the story meanders and ultimately collapses under its own girth. With a decent opening -including a bubbling, melting man (!!)- this could have been a twisted masterwork. Alas, once Jennifer Grey arrives in Jamaica, things bog down in a Nancy Drew-type mystery, minus any real intrigue or thrills. Not even Ms. Grey's tight T-shirts can save this one from mediocrity. And don't get me started on the ridiculous CRYPT-KEEPER segments! Yecch!..."
3,A Good Movie Fans Would Enjoy,"This isn't a bad movie, in fact, I think that Crypt fans would enjoy this movie. Now I agree, the Cryptkeeper looks real crappy on the movie but he still has the same personality and voice, even though it is with a Jamaican accent. The movie itself is pretty cool, it has one gory scene and a nice twist at the end. Ritual isn't scary, but it will definitely keep your interest the entire time. Overall good, I'm not sad that I bought the movie and I think it is worth buying. In some ways, this is better than Bordello of Blood (which wasn't that good)."
2,less than you would expect,"this movie ritual from tales from the crypt, is not as good as all of the other tales from the crypt full lenght movies, and short stories that i own. it lacks excitement, and it is not something i would recomend to my friends."
2,was that jennifer grey!!! movie sucked!,i watched this whole movie saying dam that main girl looks like jennifer grey. But it cant be she looks to young! Then it ends and the credits roll and dam it is her. Well i must say she looks hotter in this movie than she ever has. She was 41 when this movie was made and now shes 47. She has aged great and with the nose job she really looked different. OK well the movie sucked only saw it cause im a big tales from the crypt fan. Love the movies except this one and i have 4 seasons on dvd.BUT nothings beats the almighty DEMON KNIGHT one of the best horror movies ever!!!
1,Packaging stinks,The product came as described but I was very disappointed with the shipping. I paid an extra almost $6 for the faster shipping. It cam on almost the last day and was shipped in a flimsy plastic envelope that was so torn and ripped that it had damaged the DVD itself. When I wrote to movie mars about it they offered to let me return it and they would cover only up to $4 for return shipping! I got this for rockadoodle so since the other side movie skips I figured I'd just keep it. Probably won't buy movies from this company again. Should've listened to other posts that complained about shipping.
3,Rock-A-Doodle Doo!,"Rock-A-Doodle alone is worth it, Pebble and the Penguin is ...O.K. at Best. But Again Rock-A-Doodle Sooo worth it! certainly worth the purchase."
4,Well written for interviewees,"I was happy to have this book to serve as a guide during my interview process for a Java apps programmer position. It was well written with an insightful assortment of interview questions - both technical and non-technical. The questions on Java are relevant to all releases of Java 2, but would like to see an update that includes new features found in release 5.0. Other than that, a well written guide."
4,A Necessary Book,"Excellent book, good definitions, but wish it also included pronunciation guide for each word."
4,Good Plugs,Always liked NGK Spark Plugs a little more expansive than through an autoparts store but helped add $ for shipping.
3,Not complete,"I just got this book recently, and I was pretty disappointed with it. Although it's not The Monkees fault, almost every passage in this book has been quoted on one website or another, making almost everything in the book lose it's freshness. Also, the Monkees don't talk about the group's long breaking-up period (from when Peter left in spring, 1969, to when Micky and Davy finally called it quits in 1970) or their lives individually after they broke up and very briefly about their lives before they were picked for the show. Still, the few parts that weren't quoted on websites before are interesting (like the Micky-making-fun-of-Don Kirshner story), and it's charming to read their recollections, particulary Micky's and Peter's. In short, this is a good book, but it's missing some stuff, and don't be surprised if you've read pratically everything in it before."
1,"out of date, poorly written","I would not recommend this book unless you are looking for a historical perspective. My impression is that this small paperback was written by a student as a thesis project. It is poorly organized, horribly out of date (read: insensitive to diversity and today's norms/values), and poorly edited. The question and answer section in the back is really embarrassingly funny, with questions like, ""is it ok to whip the child if he consistently misbehaves"" (which, to the author's credit, she answers 'no') and statements referencing ill-behavior like ""evidence of homosexuality"".There are typos throughout and the typesetting appears to be done by hand in some areas, with fonts not matching up, type sizes varying within the same sentence, etc. A poor choice."
5,Great Rack :),"I have a rack very similar to this one and I love it! It is easy to assemble, compact, and sturdy. I live in a small apartment and it's a great item to have for my smelly hockey gear. I highly recommend this product to anyone who plays hockey and deals with the dreaded smelly gear!"
4,Excellent Hard Core Metal,"If your an underground fan this alblum is for you. The lead guitar is awesome, fast and furious riffs John Grosso is one of the most talented artists in uderground scene today. The only thing I didnt like was the lead singer,on some tracks he tries to rap when he can't. Wsou, #1 College Hard Rock Station"
1,Very poor...unfortunately the only one...,"Juha Tetri's Kunniamerkkikirja is very bad example of how book about orders & Medals should be made. All pictures are very small and none of the items are pictured from both sides. This is currently only book that covers Finnish Orders & Medals, but I would easily find the same information on world wide web - and with better pictures. And... This is in Finnish - Short English summary does not help a lot..."
1,More like a sales brochure.,"I was very disappointed with this book. I felt like is was more like a sales brochure than a book. Their were too few testimonials and they were not specific. It just magicly helps everything at about the same dosage. Not one negative or down side about Noni Juice, ever. I was truly looking for info on Noni juice and did not recieve it."
2,Meh,Was pretty boring actually but that may be because I'd already read about the benefits of noni juice & not the book's fault.
5,My Favorite CFMX Book,I have about 5 books on CFMX and this is the only one I use anymore. It seems to be a book that is either loved or hated with no room in between. I loved it and in the past I have not liked Forta's books.I learn best by getting the big picture and seeing how the pieces fit rather than learning about the pieces and then building the big picture. This book allowed me to see the bigger picture and how the pieces fit in it.Another reviewer complained about the explanation of the cflogin function. This was the very reason I loved the book. I looked at the code and glanced through the text for any needed explanations and the confusion I had was cleared up in a matter of minutes. An hour later the administrative site I was working on had much cleaner code and it was working properly.Not every tag is covered in detail but most of what is covered in the body of the book was easy for me to understand. If you learn like me I highly reccomend it.
3,Reviews again,"Ben is good, well very good but this is just an update from all the other CF books he has written. There are others, go to book stores and read the book before ordering this way you can have all the information right up front and not have to second guess, from someone else's opinions who may be totally NEW-BE to CF and not know that much. Do NOT base your purchase on the opinions here, why, cause half the authors right the opinions, or some pinhead who doesnt know jack about the product."
1,Missing Several Chapters,"I recently bought this book and it is missing complete chapters.24 - Enhancing Forms with Client-Side Java30 - Working with Stored Procedures32 - Generating Non-HTML Content33 - Interacting with the Operating System35 - Event SchedulingEach of these chapters are listed in the table of contents with a heading only and when you turn to the page listed, there is a cover page and that is it. There are no pages missing in the numbering which leads me to believe they were all printed this way. Between missing pages and typos throughout, it looks like they decided to skimp on the editing process. Quantity does not equal Quality. Had I noticed how sloppily this book had been put together, I wouldn't have wasted the money."
1,What a book of ColdFusion MX!,XML--One of the most important aspects of ColdFusion MX is barely mentioned. What a book of ColdFusion MX! I will never buy anything from these so-called authors.
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"There is no point of adding anything else but saying that all you need to know about CF you can find in this book. About previous reviews, I would say that people who mentioned that there are 5 chapters missing are complete IDIOTS since on each chapter page (that is missing) there is a note on the end of that page saying: ""The entire text of this chapter can be found on the included CD""... haha I guess they didn't read that part ;)"
2,More is not More,"I bought this book based on the comments by previous reviewers. And though it might serve as a reference for me in the future, I was rather disappointed.Perhaps my expectations were also shaped by programming books I have used and loved in the past, but I thought this one was way to verbose - straying FAR off topic (for example: the ""real"" definition of the internet, basic Dreamweaver MX - which felt way too much like a proprietary plug for Macromedia), and taking much more space than necessary to explain and demonstrate ColdFusion tags.In short, I found this book too little for too much: too little information for the price and difficulty of finding it. In this case, less would definitely have been more.For the beginning web developer, this might be a great book, but if you've already got a reasonably good handle on web app development, then I will have to disagree with a previous reviewer and say that perhaps another book would be a better use of your time and money."
5,the most charismatic technical writer ever borned,Even if you don't want to learn Cold Fusion you cannot avoid it. I prefer reading that book at the bed instead of a novel.
5,Great Easy Storage containers,"These containers have paid for themselves time after time. They stay new looking and can be used dry, wet, or cold or warm."
2,Not as good as Lock & Lock,This product is thinner than the Lock & Locks sold here on Amazon. They are the latest imitation trying to copy Lock & Lock's innovation and technology and not as good or better!
1,Drags On,"Same ol' tired voice over and over. Not horrible beginnning to end, but not so good either. The band's name sums it up."
5,My very first DSLR camera,"I really LOVE this camera, even though this is my first dslr camera that I have owned. I have been searching for a long time trying to find a camera that would work for me and one that wouldn't break the bank as I am an unemployed graphic design student that needs high res. photos for my portfolio work. I have two hybrids that have great zooms but they do not have the snap speed for taking photos as this Canon does.I had my eyes set on a Nikon, but somehow I came back to Canon!!"
5,GOOD book,I am still a novice I am still learning I know thatI still have a long way to go and still a lot to learn but for a novice like me it is good may be when I know more I can review this review
4,Wonderful Camera - but,"I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. The photos, however, are wonderful. Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable. (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.)"
3,Major drawback in LCD screen,"I was so excited to get this as my first SLR camera, it was very affordable and had so many features... however, I didn't realize that you could not use the LCD screen as a viewfinder. You have to look through the tiny viewfinder to see your picture before you take it. Then you can view the pictures taken via the LCD screen. Major drawback for me. I will be returning it and buying a different camera that allows for LCD viewfinder usage."
3,"Good, but We cannot use LCD screen for taking pictures. It is only for review","Good, but We cannot use LCD screen for taking pictures. It is only for review"
1,LCD Screen fails after one year. Costs $239 to repair!,"The LCD screen stopped working after a little over a year. It looks like static on the screen. It costs $239 and four weeks to get fixed. What a piece of junk! I am very, very disappointed and will not buy another Canon."
2,Love-Hate Relationship,"I love the size and potiential of this camera. The fact that I could use my old lens was what caused me to only look at Canon Cameras.PROBLEM: White Balance was way off. When I took pictures, the blues did not come through. For example, I took one picture of a fortress in Corfu, Greece that had a background of a blue sky with a few white clouds with the new Canon XT and my wife's $300 5mp Sony. The Sony showed blue skies and white clouds and the Canon showed all grey skies. No distinction between the clouds and the sky. I shoot this in the automatic (green square) mode.I worked with the professional photogragher on our cruise ship and he agreed there was a problem. I returned the camera and obtained a refund. I was disappointed. One final comment: I am not a professional photographer so this could be pilot error!"
5,I take it everywhere,I am an amateur photographer so my opinion is not based on more technical aspects. This camera is so great compared to my non slr digital camera. I have a one year old child who is never still. This camera allows me to catch those moments that the other digital would miss. It's so easy to use. The automatic mode has captured some pretty amazing photos. There are creative modes that allow me to choose how much control I want - great for a beginner like me. It's so much lighter than the other digital slr cameras that I was considering. I can take it everywhere without much trouble. I highly recommend it!
3,Excellent Camera,"I have owned the Digital Rebel XT many months ago and have been mostly pleased. The various modes give great control over subjects and the size makes it easy to carry around to the various locations. The camera started giving ""Error 99"" and eventually ended up sending it to Cannon in California. They fixed the problem quickly, and because I had my original Proof of Purchase information and warranty card, did not charge me, and sent it back mostly fixed. The meter still acts up at random times highlighting multiple instances in the meter display when it gets an light source on it. It is still an amazing camera, much lower in price now than when I purchased in new, though it would be good to explore your options."
4,Great,"great camera, very responsive and fast, after using many point and shoot and advanced point and shoot cameras, this was definitely a step up for me. The only problem i have is the stock lens delivers some soft images, i would recommend buying the body and another lens"
5,My Weapon of Choice...,I've been using a RebelXT for the past 6 years or so. This is the second one I've bought and it's worth every penny.
2,Disappointing,"I've had this for quite some time so this review is overdue but well-considered. Canon products aren't what the once were. The auto-focus struggles with alarming frequency. The display is minute and of poor resolution. The manual adjustments are somewhat non-intuitive. The build quality is a bit weak and questionably arranged. All things considered (after several years' consideration), I should have gotten the comparable Nikon."
5,good,"good camera, very accurate, it is recommended that ultrasonic lenses and full frame cameras because with these the image is very good, as 28 -105"
2,Bad experience,"the camera it's very good for the price, the lens it's mediocre but..again, for that price what do you want?I purchased this camera at Target, it was the last one on the shelf. I got a great price but then I realized why. as I purchased the cf card (in another place since they were out) I noticed the infamous ""Err CF"" message: the pins were bent. But not only..I decided (shame on me for not returning it) to ship the camera to Canon, I thought it would be fixed for free and then it would be ok. I received the camera back and for a while it's been working fine. Then it started giving that message again, every now and then, to the point that it was hard to take pictures. I shipped the camera back to Canon and they wanted to charge me for the repair. They said the pins were bent. THEY WEREN'T!! There is a problem with the firmware/hardware in the card reading/writing process. Some cameras have it some don't. I wouldn't reccomend this camera."
4,Great camera to start with.,"There is no right or wrong choice when it comes to DSLRs, before going for this specific camera I consulted myself with couple of friends - pro photographers, one said Olympus the other Canon. It's purely a matter of taste when choosing between the four major players (Sony & Nikon). I went with Canon because of the great lenses they offer.Pros: Great package, enough resolution, built-in flash, vast selection of Canon and 3rd party lenses and accessories to choose from.Cons: Plastic body, no image stabilizer, cannot access directly ISO, metering or white balance (could get a bit annoying running through menus).Other: I don't regret getting this camera, and since added some very nice fixed focus lenses to my bag - looking into buying the 40D."
5,Canon Digital Rebel XT masterpiece,"I've had this camera for some time now and it continues to impress! I go to car shows, sporting events, races, etc. and this camera can handle it all awesome. It may be a little pricey for some, but you get what you pay for. I have a 6GB card with it and went to the Detroit Auto Show and didn't even use hardly any of the memory on the card(and I took well over 450 pics). The pics are very clear with minimal or no distortion at all. I've been reviewing pics of the auto show all over the internet and my pics still seem clearer and more vibrant than any I've seen from any professional or otherwise that have them posted online. This thing is THE best camera I've ever used and I would strongly recommend it any day!"
4,Great all around digital SLR,I've loved using my Rebel XT since I purchased it 3 months ago. I've been able to capture some great shots with ease. So far no problems and it's kept up with my travels well. I recommend it to all!
4,"low end, but great SLR",This camera doesn't come with a memory card... I guess I didn't realize that before buying it. Otherwise I might not have thought this was such a great deal. Look into their XTi. I'm pretty sure the shutter speed is significantly faster. Also do research on lenses you might want before you buy. There are some kits that might come with more than one lens.
5,Great Camera,Great Camera For all purposes. unlike some other reviews that state this camera is small. that is 100% false it is a good size camera with fast capturing capabilities. Great Item!!
4,Excellent Camera but...,"This is an awesome camera that takes excellent pictures, what I missed is the chance to view the photos in the screen before taken it, you cannot see the image in the screen to take your picture."
5,"Great service, better price!","I spent a lot of time online searching for the best price on this camera, and this was it. It arrived in a few days and was perfect. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my 17-year-old daughter, and she is thrilled. Just remember to purchase a memory card separately as no card is included with the camera kit."
4,Canon Rebel EOS XT 8mp,"I am a novice photographer, but really feel in love with the abilites that this camera has! I have owned several other digital cameras including the Sony Mavica & the Canon Sureshot. This camera is clearly a step above, and I am very happy that I purchased it!I just recently purchased a Tamrom Lense which provides me with slightly better zoom, and substantially better clarity and colors!Hope this helps - Good Luck"
5,Excellent Camera,"Bought the Canon Rebel XT primarily to take pictures of grandkids' sporting events. I'm not an expert photographer, but am able to take great pictures in both outdoor and indoor settings. (I also bought a telephoto lens.) I especially like the ability to take rapid shots to later review to choose the best ones to save and print. The Rebel XT is easy to use and with the accomopanying software one can efficiently crop, enhance and print various size pictures. This is the 4th digital camera I've bought and is by far the best (but not the most expensive) one I've owned."
4,"Nice Pictures, Fast Warranty Service","This camera has been reviewed many, many times so I don't have much to add. The pictures are great, it's easy to use, etc. Aside from that, it did stop working on my vacation about 3 months after I purchased it. I sent my camera in to a Canon Service depot and I received it back, fixed, within a week. While I wasn't overly impressed that the camera broke in the first place, I was impressed by the quick, hassle-free service."
5,Just the camera I've been looking for,"My first camera years ago was a Canon TLb. Then Canon A-1, then Minolta and finally a Nikon N60. Never had the great pictures with anything else than the Canon's. My first digtal was a 3 megapixel Olympus C-3020. Love the pictures BUT hate the wait to focus/capture the picture. Grandkids don't wait for the camera. I wanted something that would take a picture at the same speed as a film camera and but excellent quality. With the XT, when I press the shutter, I take the picture, and can take pictures even when the grandkids are moving. I coupled this XT with a Canon 28-135 IS zoom lens. Great combo."
4,"great camera, buy only from amazon","I love my new digital rebel XT. Takes great pictures especially with the EF 50mm f1.8 lens I got for it.The kit lens is fine for an amateur like me.BUT, I would hesitate to order from any of the other merchants listed here, except for Amazon.I got my camera from Adorama, and they sent me a torn up reciept in the box. I needed the reciept for my rebate and they would NOT return my emails requesting a new copy of me receipt.From now on, I only order directly through Amazon."
5,This was my first camera,"Unfortunately someone swiped it, but I learned how to shoot digital photos on this model. I loved it and used it every day until it was stolen. I'll probably upgrade for my next camera, but for the price this is an excellent model for anything you'd need to do. If you're a pro then you already know what you need, but if you're getting into photography and am not sure what your first camera should be, you won't be disappointed by this one. The only thing that could be better is the autofocus in low light conditions, but if you are not into using manual focus then you may as well just get a nice powershot that will fit in your pocket."
4,"love it, with 1 exception","I was new to 35mm cameras when I purchased this camera. Within a couple of hours, I felt in command of most of the controls, and was taking good photographs. It has a built in light meter display, so you can adjust your settings to get appropriate light, before you shoot the picture.One nice thing is that the camera shuts off if you accidentally leave it on, which I have done on several occasions.The only complaint I have is the autofocus. I shoot photos of animals indoors, and I have enough to worry about without having to manually focus the camera. At the same time, I need this kind of camera to have control of lighting. The autofocus in these situations is too slow, or it seems confused and unable to choose what to focus on.Loading photographs onto my PC seems to go very slowly as well.I recommend getting the best lens you can afford (widest range of focal lengths) since the one that comes standard in most packages is a little limiting. You won't regret it."
5,Expanding the great Canon Digital SLR line,"I already had a digital rebel and was able to sell it to a co-worker and use the proceeds for my new rebel xt. Faster, lighter, better. Simple review. It took everything that was great about my digital rebel and made it better. Some complain that it feels ""too light""...OK...it that's your thing. To me, it's still solid and the pictures speak for themselves.Now, with the addition of the 10 MP rebel xt, I'll bet the original xt can be purchased for an even better price.No downsides that I can think of..."
4,Canon Rebel has a cause,"I received this camera as a Christmas gift. I was heming and hawing for over a year on whether to transition from film SLR to digital, and if digital, compact or SLR. Well, I asked Santa for this bad boy. What a camera! Impresively light weight, sufficiently rugged, great flash, quick turn on and shoot, very log lasting battery pack. I love this camera and highly recommend it."
5,It's everything I needed,"I had 2 Rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. While I had owned other digitals I keep going back to my old Rebel, until now. We got the back up battery pack. My husband and I love it."
3,"Great Specs, but too small","This is a really nice Digital SLR, but if you are upgrading from the original Digital Rebel be warned that this is a MUCH smaller body. It does not have the same high quality feel as the first and it is actually pretty hard to use if you have large hands. To me it is almost worth paying the $450 more for the 20d just to get the larger body."
3,2nd best,Short and sweet.. Spend the extra money for the XTi. I returned this camera and bought one. The XTi outshines this unit for about $100 more.
4,Great Buy,"Just recently purchased this camera to replace my old Canon 35mm SLR which had been sitting in storage for a couple of years since I bought my first digital.Already having Canon USM lenses I got the body only and am very impressed with the results so far. I can honestly say that the only photos that haven't come out the way I wanted them to were purely my fault.Gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons.1. I am used to changing the focus from Single to Servo using a dial. Since I change this setting a lot I do not really like having to push buttons to do this.2. They have made this camera a lot smaller than the 'traditional' Canon SLR. Mostly in the width...I did prefer the larger body size personally.3. Having to push buttons to change the focus point really does annoy your subjects for portrait shots. (It takes some time) I know I should have bought another camera with Eye focusing if this was an issue for me, but it is just what you get used to I suppose."
4,Great camera but instructions are weak and NO FLASH CARD???!?!?,"This is a great camera, but it is a REAL frustration to spend north of $800 and not have something work out of the box because it has no memory card. At first I figured I'd lost it so I spend a half hour looking through the garbage before emailing customer service. They seemed to think some advice on where to buy a flash card would suffice. The instruction manual is no work of art eitherWith all that said, it is an excellent camera with an easy interface to the computer."
5,Beware of marketplace scammers,This is a great camera but be aware of the prices in marketplace that seem too low. They are. These people are just trying to scam you. DO NOT wire them money.
4,great camera but need different lense,I love this camera I dont hardly miss a shot. The one thing I do not like is that the lense that comes with the camera does not get up close enough now I need another lense.This camera otherwise is so far a great camera
4,Different results than the Rebel SLR film camera,"I've had a the Canon Rebel for film which unfortunately is in not working, but in the auto focus mode, it seemed easier to get a great shot than in this one. I've had a whole birthday party turn out blurry with this camera. It's likely that I just didn't find the right setting, but it's not like I just opened the box either. It was a bowling alley, lower light with action so that made a difference. Also, I have had situations where I would like a shot with no flash, but I can't avoid blur. I switched to manual and seemed to get what I wanted, but the auto focus almost always forces a flash in most any lighting situation! ERRRR! I am going to switch to the lens with my old camera and hope this helps. This is still the best deal you will find if you are desperate for a digital SLR like I was. Best of luck!"
5,"High Range of Functions, Great Cost","As a complete newcomer to the DSLR world, I wasn't sure which camera to purchase to explore the world of photography. I thought about the XSi...the features sounded impressive, especially the Megapixels. But a friend of mine said that after about 5MP, the numbers don't really matter unless you're planning on printing poster-size photos (which few of us would actually do). The 8MP images of this camera are gorgeous and crystal clear--you'd never miss having a 12MP camera. All it would do is make the file sizes HUGE, and you'll have to get an external hard drive to save your photos. (Number of MPs is really ploy to get consumers to buy a more expensive model)The features on this unit are vast enough for an advanced photographer but has enough automatic features on it that it will ease you into the world of photography. I highly recommend this camera!"
5,Canon Digital Rebel XT,"I bought this camera used and am happily snapping away with a prime lense from a Rebel 2,ooo.The pictures are great. Also, the experience with shipping and product representation were good. Thanks"
5,Great product,"It is the best SLR camera for entry-level user. Easy to use, great quality. I was struggling between a cheap DV or good camera. I am very happy with my choice."
1,0 star,"Why I gave it one star? Because it doesn't even power on although I bought it brand new. Of course I fully charged the battery! Of course i tried new batteries.I called canon, canon said I had mail it to canon for services and i have to pay the shipping to the factory.I asked how long to get it fixed and they said at least a month. I asked can I get a exchange and they said no.The body and lens are made with plastic. very cheap.For a product and services like this, it deserves 0 star.You gave it 5 star because you are lucky."
1,"May be a good product, but service is bad","The company that sells this camera is not customer friendly,they asked if you have any questions, or concerns, and when I did give a response my order was cancelled, they did not try to fix the problem at all, and I needed this for a Christmas gift for my daughter, I would not use this company, the product may be great, but the service is awful.Angie Smith"
1,Autofocus poor,"I've been waiting for a SLR digital that's affordable ($1,000 or less) and which can handle high ISOs well. I enjoy shooting without a flash, and am used to Fuji 800 film which has some beautiful grain, and I didn't want to loose that experience with my ""upgrade"" to digital"".The HUGE dissapointment is the focus appears very poor. I've seen other poeple say the same thing on user groups, including some people suggesting it's only a problem in the ""creative zones"". Either way, I've ended up with more out of focus pictures in 2 months than I've gotten in 2 years.Until Cannon fixes this problem, I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it. It's really frusturating to have dozens of great compositions that are out of focus."
5,Sencillamente EXTRAORIDINARIA,Soy un usuario un poco mas que amateur y mucho menos que profesional y esta camara me resulta realmente extraordinaria. Una gran cantidad de opciones y lo mas importante con una gran calidad!!!Estoy tomando mi primer curso de fotografia y la verdad cada vez me demuestra que es una gran camara. 100% recomendada.
4,Great Buy!,"Overall this camera is a great buy. I have seen what others have said about the auto focus, it tends to focus on the wrong things in the seven point mode. You can bypass this in the P mode by choosing the central point focus, but then you lose out on the other Auto features. The only other problem I have had is that the flash sometimes seems out of sync. Some of my shots you can actually see the flash on the left side of the picture, that it hasn't made it across in time.But don't let this slight irritations stop you from buying it! Compared to the point and shoot models out there this slr camera for the price is superior."
3,great camera to learn with but.........,"I have owned this camera for almost 2 years now, and it was great to learn about photography with perfect for a beginner trying to get into it. Unfortunately yesterday the 7 point auto focus stopped working and i tried three different lenses and had the same problem the camera would not focus on its own and it has never been dropped."
5,This Merchant Will Go The Extra Mile,"I had some problems with the order because I gave the wrong adress, I contacted the merchant and he gave me a top notch service, he went the extra mile for me and I really appreciate this."
3,Decent camera for the price.,"This was my first DSLR camera. It was great! However, I found myself outgrowing it rather quickly, and upgraded to the 40d."
5,Amazing,"This was the best 400 plus dollars I have ever spent. Read every review, I doubt you can find something negative about this."
4,Good body not so good lens,This is a great entry level (or for those like myself who are going from film to digital) camera. I took 30 or 40 shots with the kit lens and they were not real good. I then purchased the EF 100mm f2.8 Macro and the picture quality improved big time. I use this lens for both everyday and macro photography. It is quieter when in AF mode not to mention faster. The best way to buy this camera is body only and then buy a good lens.
1,I don't recommend it,"This DVD can be summarized easily in a couple of sentences: ""1. There are many living creatures today which look very much like some fossils found in the dinosaur fossil layer. 2. It means that evolution never happened"". I have many problems with this DVD. First, the pseudoscientific method they used in their research: a doctor (MD), not a paleontologist, went from museum to museum taking photos of fossils. Then he compared the pictures to the existing species. This is it, more or less. The authors did not use any scientific method, they simply relied on their eyes. The authors of the DVD don't mention any intermediate animals, such as tiktaalik (see Neil Shubin). In addition, they hint on some global paleontologic museum-conspiracy, that is, deliberately not displaying fossils of living species to the public. I also have a PhD, but having a doctoral degree does not qualify anyone to mislead the public."
3,Quick read,About the book good but dated suggestions so take that as you may if you never thought of this great but if you have and seen this type of information before you may want to skip it.Abouth the seller great book sent very quickly and in great condition I would buy from this seller again than you.
3,Slightly preachy.,"Daniel Black has matured into a wonderful writer. His ""Perfect Peace"" is at least 4 stars. This, his first novel, is quite good but launches occasionally into a preachy mode that I think is just a matter of being less experienced. Still quite worth a read."
1,Very slow read,"I normally do not review books, but I couldn't resist on this one. This was probably once of the worse books I've read in a long time, and I am NEVER without a book! I have been reading it for over a month, and just can't get through it. I read Perfect Peace and thought that it was exceptionally well written, so I couldn't wait to read this one. Boy, was I disappointed! I have skipped through so much of the hum drum, got to the main point, and am now ready to put this one to rest without even finishing it! I'm a little scared to order Mr. Black's latest book."
4,Good book....a little slow,"I enjoyed this book...it was a little bit harder read and a bit mundane at certain parts, but there were some very strong and prevalent messages and lessons that I took away from the story."
3,Decent Book,I read this author's other book Perfect Peace and loved it. This one was okay but I thought it lacked some of the drama and excitement of his previous novel. I would read another novel by this author.
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"I was so impressed with this author and how he wrote this book. This book was like a learning experience for me about our culture. Halfway through this book, I got online to search this author's name just to see if he had anymore books out and he does! I can't wait to order it!This book is about a man that leaves home because his father was abusive and his mother always treated him like she hated him. He went to New York and got his PHD in Black Studies. Ten years later he returned home to discover that his sister (age 17) was dead and buried in the backyard..this alone should prompt you to pick up the book!HIGHLY recommended!"
5,Riveting and Thought Provoking!!,"They Tell Me of a Home is a riveting page-turner. Dr. Black tells the story of a young college-educated African American male returning home to the rural South only to face carefully kept secrets that once revealed have profound implications for the rest of his life. The plot has enough twists and turns to command a reader's attention to the end. Dr. Black does an excellent job of representing the dialect and culture of the rural South and presenting lessons we should all take to heart. The book provided my book club with much to ponder. This is a wonderful first effort. I salute Dr. Black!Sandra of Ladies of Color Book Club, Southern California"
1,"Disappointing, At Best","Shrill, whiny, amateurish, more than a bit preachy. Not nearly up to the hype it has received. A couple interesting characters and a couple interesting plot points but not worth paying for. If you really want to read this book, try the library."
3,It was okay.,"I don't usually read this type of book, but I found it at the library on one of their ""promising ready"" shelves. I was immediately absorbed into this book, the richness of the characters and their accurate and resonble descriptions. I personally enjoyed the name dropping of book titles and the baptist hymnals, it took me back to church, a place i haven't been for a while. I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book, before it gets weird. Not getting to much into the specifics, the male relationships get a little ""sensual"" ( his word) in a uncomfortable and unrealistic way. I literaly almost stopped reading the book it was so grotesque and outlandish. But, somehow by the end I was crying, and hopeful.So, if you enjoy a ride of emotions in a well written, if unbelieveable story; Go for it.please visit me at BookDevour@blogspot.com"
1,Just way too much whining!,"Now just about a quarter into this book and all I have read so far is bad. The main character comes back after ten year without a words to anyone. He expects to be fed and to stay with the same people he hates and supposedly hate him too. The main character whines about everything and engage in conflicts like a child not a PHD holder. His only plea being that he loved his sister and she loved him and they owe him an answer.Poor character development.If it took him 10 years to come back home one would hope he had plenty of time to think about what he would say, do. Another bad moment...just back in his parents' house barely talked to anyone and he retreats to his room to write a letter to his best friend!It is sadly a poor attempt at what could have been a great story."
1,Really disappointing,"I really looked forward to this book, but it disappointed me in every way--the writing, the lack of true character development, the immaturity of the ""hero"" (whom the author obviously admired), the absence of any consequences for horrendous behavior (murder of a child by her mother). The subject could have made for a great story, but the author seems much too full of himself and not nearly so smart as he believes."
4,Surreal,"As the co-founder of Scribblers' Retreat Writers' Conference, I try to read at least one of the books each of our speakers has written. Daniel Black is one remarkable author. He knows how to grab the reader the moment you open the book and he does not let you assume anything. His authentic form of writing the way they speak makes it so much more realistic. You end up asking yourself over and over, ""Did this really happen?"" If it didn't , it could have, and that makes the whole story even more frightening and appalling.I am glad Daniel is coming for our February conference. I will have a list of questions for him. Register and come to meet the other nine as well. I simply must have an signed copy of They Tell Me of a Home and get The Sacred Place and Perfect Peace.Jeanie Pantelakis[...]"
5,Awesome read!,Lots of twists and turns. Certainly kept my attention. A real page turner! Author has quite an imagination. Hope there's a sequel.
3,An Enyoyable Read,"This is the second novel that I have read by Daniel Black. First, I read Perfect Peace and frankly I liked it more. Hoewever, This is also a good book. It's an easy read and it held my interest from beginning to end. I enjoyed it."
3,Avenger,Good read was interesting had a lot of hero's and action enjoyed it and recommend ultimates to every one who likes superheroes
4,super hero soap opera,"I love the realistic artwork and it has a storyline that is interesting, full of action, and geared towards adults. I'm anxious for the next volume."
1,Post 9/11 confusion in comic book form,"The problems with this series:1. Bigotry2. Racism3. The dark sides of nationalism4. Cruel and unusual is the norm and to be accepted5. Gore, gore, gore6. Captain America, who represented the 'ultimate' paragon of the American dream/way is now someone to fear and hate instead of someone to admireand, finally, the worst is:7. Americans and their heros are portrayed as being no better than the Aliens (i.e. terrorists) they fight. Traditionally, rogue soldiers and commanders might be portrayed as homicidal maniacs - now ALL Americans are portaryed as lazy, cruel, sadistic, wife-beating, dishonest ... jerks."
1,nauseating,"My dog kept throwing up after I put them in her food. Finally, I made the taste test, and understood why - The taste is absolutely disgusting. They are completely unpalatable. And this company does not accept returns - so this was a complete waste of money."
2,Seems ok,"The dog likes them, but I have no way to know about safety or effectiveness. I am not buying them as a treat. Too many indistinguishable products like this."
5,Excellent product!!!!!,"My dog is a yellow lab and is 6 years old... he was having trouble with this hips now he is strong and can run again with no problem...!!! I love this product, they brought me back my Polo..."
3,not sure yet,"I'm hoping that it takes a while for this to build up, I'd like to see more relief for my dogs and their sore/weak hips and back ends. The price was the BEST I could find anywhere online. The dogs dont mind the taste, the tablets are always gone from their bowls."
1,Totally without value,It's truly hard to believe that a publisher thought this book wasworth publishing. It's 250 pages with several empty cliches perpage.
4,Very Nice,"A very nice rollator indeed. No real assembly required and the item is very sturdy. Don't order any walker/rollator sight unseen. While this was a wonderful product, it wasn't ""right"" for my aunt. We ended up taking her to a medical supply store and letting her 'test drive' some rollators."
3,NOT AS SHOWN,"This walker comes with a soft collapsible basket NOT a wire basket as shown. My mother specifically wanted the wire basket. After two phone calls to Amazon, and promises to ship another walker with a basket, the problem has yet to be resolved. Too much of a hassle, I guess we'll just have to keep it. I should have rated the walker itself five stars, as it's very nice, lightweight and easy to assemble. The three star rating is for Amazon."
4,Very well built,This item is very well built and moves easily over rough terrain. I would give it 5 stars but-- it is built for tall individuals. If I sit on it my feet do not touch the ground.
4,An important back story on Ms. Wollstonecraft,"This is the back story to Mary Wollstonecraft's life written by her second husband. It is important to understand her environment and upbringing to better understand her own work. A worthy companion to her work ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"""
1,Very disappointed in this 40's Candy Crate,This 40's Candy Crate was a birthday gift for my husband. It was wrapped very nice and there were all kinds of neat candies in the box. But everything in the box is so hard and stale you can't eat it. The wrapper wouldn't come off some of the candies. We were very disappointed in this product.
5,Awesome read!,This book will take you less than an hour to read andwill make your day! A great read for book groups.
1,Not worth the money,"This book was the worst. Many errors. I was surprised to see that they had someone listed as an editor. Clearly, they didn't edit it. Practice test is messed up with two #91's so the answers don't match. Don't waste your money."
4,One of the best meditation books,"This book was my first introduction to mediation and it changed my life for the better. Great for anyone with a spiritual belief (any belief/ religion - it has something for everyone). Possibly not the best for someone who has no spiritual leanings though and due to the commitment required, may not be suitable for people learning meditation who have very young families. A really great read even if you don't use the meditation tools."
4,great book if you taking biology,"bought this book for my biology class and even though it is missing some words, it is still a good investment."
2,Biases diminish importance or impact of this text,"Triumph of the spirit recounts the events leading to the March 1998 protests at Gallaudet University in Washington D.C. Author Angel Ramos delivers a shamelessly biased, at times even quixotic view of the protests and the subsequent national fixation on Deaf rights. Written more as propaganda that historical narrative, Ramos peppers the text with so many unsubstantiated conclusions and baseless emotional speculations that the book becomes quaint but hardly a serious historical text by any standard. One can imagine a repressed elation as Ramos demonizes certain trustees while generalizing anecdotal support as a national groundswell of opinion when, in reality, most Americans know nothing of Gallaudet or the Deaf President Now movement. Having enjoyed serious historical text from critical authors, this book serves as a catalogue of incidents and a rough timeline but should enjoy no serious consideration from any reader with a critical lens."
2,Mediocre coverage of an incredible event,"The uprising at Gallaudet University and the ""Deaf President Now"" campaign were the culmination of a long and fascinating history of the Deaf people and culture. Interesting as the events were, however, this book is not the place to be introduced to them. The writing is mediocre at best, and oftentimes reads like a junior high school essay. And as was mentioned by another reviewer, the bias just bleeds off the page. Key players are either hero-worshipped or vilified, with little ground in-between.In short, the book rattles off a sequence of events like a child's report on some foreign country, but captures no essence of the excitement and tenseness that must have been present.For a much better account, I'd recommend the third chapter of ""Seeing Voices"" by Oliver Sacks. Sacks was also an eyewitness to the protests, albeit in a somewhat detached, observational role, but his writing better captures the emotion and power of this extraordinary historical event."
5,An Easy Guide.....,"This is In my opinion one of the greatest books for the beginner in magick. It explains What magick is, the tools you need and really easy but usefull spells to cast, potions to make, protection etc etc... This is DEFINETLY worth my time and money. ENJOY :)"
2,"Movie good, sound awful","The movie itself was good and the picture quality was good but the sound quality was terrible. There was an annoying base hum throughout the film that destroyed any enjoyment. Perhaps it was just a bad quality tape. I will never buy ""used"" again."
4,Very good,"I bought this CD on a whim after listening to a few clips (you can get this one for super-cheap) and was pleasantly surprised. Kind of a trip-hoppy, highly-danceable jazz excursion, Submarine's music is very listenable and is rarely tedious. It has the enthusiasm and percolating creativity of a first release, without getting bogged down in studio trickery. The music is well-performed, intelligent, and often very catchy (think mid-90s Depeche Mode). Plus, the singer has a beautiful voice.If you like Portishead, Hooverphonic, Frou Frou, or Morcheeba, this CD is worth a listen because it could very well become a staple of your collection."
5,"Sultry, Catchy, and REALLY Good","Do yourself a favor and buy this album. It's a mix of sultry vocals and every sound you could imagine from synthesized pop beats to raging electric guitars. The only bad track is ""Heartfailure."" EVERYTHING else could have been popular singles.In fact, if you ignore ""Heartfailure,"" the album, from beginning to end (excluding the bonus track ""So This is Love,"") is simply one of the best ALBUMS I've ever heard.The best songs on the album in my opinion are:1) ""Out to Lunch""2) ""Blow Me Away""3) ""Sunbeam""4) ""Evergreen""5) ""Way Out West""I'm so happy I found this album."
3,Mirror works.,"Although it does not seem to be the right size for a 93 cadillac deville, it does work. Wished it would fit exactly."
4,My 3 year old has a blast with this toy,This came with a very nice cell phone case and it works really well as carry along during car trips. My 3 year old has endless fun talking to her imaginary friends on the phone.
1,Full of his own virtue!,"I started out liking this book but was soon tired of its pedantic preaching. It gets tiring very quickly. Good heavy editing of the text (I'm the CEO of a publishing company) and a lot more photos would have greatly improved it. By his own admission and example his life is so void of virtue and character that he can only find meaning in escaping to the wilderness to some how start over again. He decries those in RVs as polluters and spoilers yet his virtue is enhanced as he dashes around all over the wild northwest in his Suburban. A SUV yet! My last complaint is that I like to pass on my outdoor books, good and bad, to one of my 14 year grandsons, as he and I hunt and fish together, but alas the R rated verbage in this made it fit only for the circular file! I would have preferred my money back!"
3,English teacher struggling to teach this book,"I am teaching Sutcliff's The Sword and the Circle to a 7th grade class. I do find the descriptive language incredibly beautiful, and I like how thorough the collection is. However, I'm finding that this book is entirely too difficult for my 7th graders (and they are a bright bunch of kids). I'm frustrated that this book is marketed to such a young audience, because I think it would be more appropriate for high schoolers and for adults. (The Sword and the Circle in the 5th grade?! I'm glad I'm not teaching that class!)Does anyone know of a collection of Arthurian legends that is well written, but more appropriate for a younger audience? I want my kids to get excited about legends, not to find them grueling and tedious."
1,Wake me when its over!,This is a horrible book! Maybe its just me but it lacks any good qualities. I snoozed off after reading a page of this. This book is just plain boring. Its filled with basically the same thing 20 times. Waste of time.
2,The review for The Sword and the Circle,"The Sword and the CircleThe Sword and the Circle was a pretty lengthy book, but good. It is not the best book though. Rosemary Sutcliff is the author of The Sword and the Circle and many other books. The book involved all of Arthur's life. From when he met Merlin, from the sword in the stone and all the way until he dies.In this book there were some chapters that you could stare at all day and others that you could fall asleep on. In this book all the characters are the same and there aren't to many twist. They only added more description to make it a little different, although, some chapters were exactly the same. In some of the chapters I knew exactly what would have happened because I already knew about.This book can fascinate you if you know about King Arthur and all around that time. I would recommend this book to older people like 15+ because kids won't enjoy it that much. As you read you can get into it and could fascinate many young readers."
1,TOO UNREALISTIC AND PLOT WAS TERRIBLE,"I had to read this book for english class and I am so glad that that class was over. The timeline was unrealistic, no descriptive words could be found (you can barely create an image of the scenes), the story jumped from one season, month, year in one paragraph. This translation of the legends is totally dumb. I refuse to believe that Sir Lancelot of the Lake was ugly BECAUSE every single girl fell in love with him and looks do count because it is his features and strenght they notice.From what I hear, The Mists of Avalon is totally better, but that book is 5 times bigger, so it'll just have to wait awhile. :)"
3,not bad..,"the quality is not as expected, it's okay but the neck portion is hard to close (clear clasp that you have to slide into a narrow hole, not so easy to see especially behind your own head!) the bottom portion kind of reminds me of a cheap rendition of basketball shorts. the cost of shipping is not really worth it."
3,great shipper,This company is a Quick shipper! Product received in new condition as advertised. Only bad thing is that this black dye doews not cover the surface area in my pond as advertised. The actual Product kinda sucks
2,pond dye,"Well I use pond dye anually and for the last two years and have added black Loch ness) to the Aqua Shade. In my opinion,Aqua Shade produces a deeper block when it comes to eliminating the sunlight to penetrate. Next year I will just purchase another gallon of Aqua Shade instead of the black"
3,"A Few Choice Cuts, A Lot Of Ho-Hum","Nina Gordon's voice reminds me way too much of Aimee Mann, and with that in mind she suffers by comparison. Her songs lack both the intensity, musical variety and bite of Mann's best work, e.g. Mr. Harris, Fifty Years After the Fair. Now I Can Die and the title cut stand out, but most of this is background music, for bars or between bands concert music, with little that wakes up the ear. I wonder if Gordon might not do better as an interpreter of other people's songs; the old Skeeter Davis country hit End of the World which closes out the album is a real gem. Overall this is unoffensive, forgettable music. Listen carefully before you buy."
3,Well..,"Nina Gordon has a really pretty voice and most of her songs sound good. However, I can't help but think she was better off with Louise Post in Veruca Salt. Nina's lyrics are a bit on the weak side and some of her songs are too slow. Her fast paced stuff sounds a lot better. No matter how good it sounds I still can't make any sense out of Number One Camera. Some highlights are New Year's Eve, 2003, and Number One Camera."
3,Solo white female,"From power pop to powder puff, former Veruca Salt frontwoman, Nina Gordon's first solo turn finds her slouching into Belinda Carlisle territory. Granted, her lush voice still glides smoothly over the hooks, heating up every soft rock turn with its sensual fullness. But deprived of the metallic pubk trang of her former bandmates, she cools from contemporary torch to triple-A diva, and the loss is the listener's. Much of the problem lies in the material: After the barbed alterna-girl rocks that first brought Veruca Salt to major label attention, these songs are bloodless, with their few good ideas sailing off without development."
2,"The chick rocks, the lyrics don't.","Not bad. If you liked VERUCA, you'll like this release from ex-frontwoman GORDON. The music is great and GORDON's voice is absolutely cool, as is the way she builds her hooks. Her musical stylings are reminiscent of KEN ANDREWS (YEAR OF THE RABBIT). Her biggest flaw lies in the lyrics department. Her words are really lacking the substance her voice can manage. It's a shame, if she could've written some strong lyrics this release would be a lot better."
2,Disappointing Solo Debut,"After hearing the title cut, I had mixed feelings about what the rest of the album might be like: I figured she could go the Aimee Mann / Til Tuesday route and have an album full of shimmering, smartly written pop songs, or the Belinde Carlisle route, and have an album of future background music to telecommunications ads. Unfortunately, it's closer to the latter. Not a terrible album, but filled with edgeless music, especially bizarre considering this is from the writer of ""Seether"" and ""Volcano Girls."" Louise Post's version of Veruca Salt (essentially a solo debut in itself) put out a far better album (Resolver) than this, and you'd be better off picking up that one if you're coming to this album as a Veruca Salt fan."
4,Veruca Vixen Proves her Mettle,"Nina was the songwriting talent in Veruca Salt. This album makes it more obvious than ever. Great work in the back by Eisenstein, Jones, Riebling and co. This is a pop album with songs that are meant to stick in your head and be whistled in the car. And they do."
4,Nina Gordon Stands Tall On Her Own,Nina Gordon sets herself apart from Veruca Salt by proving that she has lost nothing in the split. The break-up of veruca salt's two main song-writers has provided each with emotion and feeling to build new material from. Veruca Salt's new album is strong and fast. Nina Gordon's strength lies in her thoroughness. Each song is crafted as if it were painted picture reflecting a moment in her life. Do yourself a favor get Nina's new CD and Veruca Salts new disc then decide for yourself.
4,Who Needs Louise?,"Nina Gordon very well may be the next Aimee Mann, but with a harder edge. The (obvious) talent behind Veruca Salt, Nina takes her musical talent and her knack for creating catchy hooks to the solo arena, and the results are spectacular. Those looking for deep, confessional lyrics might be disappointed, and the closest you'll come are a few lines in ""Horses in the City."" But overall, this is an exceptionally well done album, with standout tracks being ""Now I Can Die,"" ""Horses in the City,"" ""2003,"" ""Hold Onto Me,"" and the title track. Nina, as gorgeous as she is talented, is on her way to a big, big solo career. Buy this album!"
4,Good mix of rock and pop,"I was never a fan of the band Veruca Salt, but when I heard Nina Gordon's song ""Tonight and The Rest of My Life"", I knew she was something special. The album will satisfy both pop lovers and rock lovers. As for her voice, it isn't particularily good, but she sings with such emotion and inspiration. Good work, Nina!"
1,Sounds like a lame version of the Bangles,"If you like Veruca Salt for their edginess, don't buy this CD. I was hoping some of the VS flavor would be brought forward into Nina Gordon's highly anticipated solo debut. But I was sorely disappointed. To me, this CD sounds like a lame Bangles imitation."
1,Irritating pop at its worst.,"I bought this album because someone told me it was good. I like word-of-mouth recommendations, they tend to be more reliable than critics, more trustworthy. In this case, I wish I hadn't listened.This album takes unimpressive to whole new levels of indifference. The music is uninteresting, the words are boring, and combined? Who cares. If I'd known at the time I got it that Ms. Gordon had been part of Veruca Salt, I would have been even more disappointed.I tried to sell this album to a used CD store, but they wouldn't take it. They had too many already. I left the disc on the railing outside, in the feeble hope that someone whose musical tastes I don't agree with would give it a good home."
1,BLECH!,"I heard ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" on the radio, and I thought it was a decent song. So, on a whim, I bought the cd. After listening to about 2 songs, I was ready to chuck this cd into the trash can. All of the songs sound the same, and it sounds a lot like the same old pop you hear, over and over, on the radio. This cd was utterly undistinguishable, save yourself $20 and buy the Dido cd instead."
5,The Waiting Is Over...,"You are gonna love this. Forget the 'something is missing' new Veruca Salt album (which I'm not knocking I hasten to add) but this... THIS is the tour de force from the pen that gave us the angry stabbing you-can't-have-it 3 minutes of brilliance 'Seether' and the female Bon Joviesque,(courtesy of Bob Rock) of Volcano Girls. I love this in the exact same way that Voice Of The Beehive made 'Let It Bee' such a major event. This album won't change the world although there are those who will say this is the best album they own ecetera (STOP doing that!). But trust me on this... It's bloody good! Great title, production, thought about kinda tunes AND it's Nina Gordan! If Veruca Salt ever got inside your head then you already know what I'm trying to say. Buy It."
4,"Sort of a less quirky Aimee Mann, but it definitely rocks...","This solid debut doesn't sound very much like Veruca Salt. It is much more mainstream, sort of a less quirky Aimee Mann, but it definitely rocks. Good grooves and strong vocals."
5,Fabulous - do yourself a favor and buy this CD,"As others have stated, you don't want to skip any songs on this CD - they're all great. Thanks, Nina, for leaving Veruca Salt and coming into your own. I'll be waiting for your next CD!!"
5,Brilliant Solo Debut by Nina Gordon,"I've only heard a few Veruca Salt songs, so I can't actually compare Nina Gordon's solo album to her old Veruca Salt stuff, but I can honestly say that this is a beautiful album. The songs have a great variety, from some softly touching to rock that sounds more like the Veruca Salt I've heard. All the lyrics are honest and the music is lyrical. I recommend this to anyone."
3,Debut CD A Mellow Trip Through Gordon's Songwriting Skills.,"Ex-Veruca Salt co-founder Nina Gordon's new CD is quite the soft mellow mix.After a few listens of her new CD Tonight & The Rest Of My Life, the conclusion: mellow.While some songs have that up-beat, Veruca Salt rock sound, most are slow confessional-type songs. Gordon's voice sounds as good as always and the title track is clearly the best choice as the first single for this CD.However, most of the songs get repetitive and are easily forgotten. Not much stands out on this first solo effort of Gordon's, but it is a nice album to listen to when you wish to kick back, plop on the couch, close your eyes and relax.Nina Gordon's songwriting abilities are quite impressive, but I'm afraid that fans of her more 'Pop-Rock' sound that she showcased in her previous work with Veruca Salt will be disappointed."
5,The Perfect CD,"If you liked Nina while she was in Veruca Salt then you will love her new solo cd. The songs range from slow to rockin. Defintetly check out ""Hate Your Way,"" ""Got Me Down,"" and ""Too Slow to Ride."" Also, ""Black and Blonde"" is a cool song featuring a line from a previous recording, ""Earthcrosser."" There is a song on here for everyone."
3,A Good Album,"I went in search of a song I heard at work, Tonight and the Rest of My life and uncovered Nina Gordon. I took a chance and bought the album. I've been listening to it for a couple of days. I enjoy it. For what it is, it's a good album if you like sweet poppy songs. It's not brillant but I enjoy listening to it. It's definitely going to stay in my collection. I think it will stand the test of time. I hope she comes out with more albums. I love that she writes her own songs. She has a nice, sweet voice."
4,Got Me Down,"I like this CD, but I was a little disappointed when I got it. I thought it was going to be better. Oh well. It's still pretty good. She's got a variety in this album."
4,Like Veruca Salt?- congratulations!,"If you like Veruca Salt you're gonna like this one as well. The songs are just as great as expected. No wonder; Take a Veruca Salt record, divide the songs by two and then double the amount - hey you've got a Nina Gordon solo album! Now I'm just waiting for Louise Post to make one as well. In short: If you're a VS-fan, there's no reason to hesiate about this one. Get it today."
3,"if resolver didn't break your heart, this one will.","i haven't taken a look at the credits for this record...but it sounds like nina is in top form as a vocalist and a songstress...the title track is nothing less than mesmerizing...and her melodies shine on many tracks......however, the ultimate effect on any true veruca salt fan is total sadness..........i had a dream...veruca salt with nina and louise recorded by butch vig..."
3,Good Voice but very unoriginal,"This album isn't horrible but it won't blow you away either with its awesomeness. It reminds me of a mix of different artists. It isn't very original, the lyrics sound like they were written by a very young girl with hormonal issues, and it's altogether average. Nina Gordon has such a great voice that it kind of saves the album for me, which is why it didn't get a lower rating."
1,I just can't believe this!,"""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" is one of the most boring songs I have ever heard and it has haunted me on commercials for TV shows, the radio, and everywhere in between. I hate that song! It's just a blah song. There's nothing special about it. I'm so tired of people saying about these kinds of artists, ""She has such a lovely voice!"" So? You gotta know how to put that lovely voice to good and unique use. Then, to my dismay, I have just learned that this woman was once part of the awsomely wonderful kick ass band known as Veruca Salt. Why would she go from gutair kicks to boring poppy crap? Ahg! My world has ended. Nina! Find your rock boots and strap on that electric guitar once more! Where has my Volcano Girl gone to?"
3,"""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" (the song) ROCKS!!!","Nina Gordon has a beautiful voice and a knack for writing terrific lyrics. Buy the album for ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" alone. It's one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard, and I listen to a LOT of music. Unfortunately the album for the most part is a mix of dull over-produced powerpop and girly quasi-metal, which is really not my thing. ""Tonight"" is awesome though, in the truest sense of the word."
2,The ROCK is gone,"First of all, I wouldn't classify most of these songs as ""rock"", like a previous reviewer did. Not even close. She's made a full transition into the pop realm, and left the rockin guitar behind.There are some good songs (Tonight and the Rest of My Life), and a few that somewhat rock (Number One Camera), but if you're looking for an extension to your Veruca Salt collection, don't bother.Overall, the album is a bit too long, giving you that ""is this album over yet?"" feel. Some tracks are too sappy for my tastes, and could easily double for any ""pop diva"" out there. Skipping a few tracks (Horses in the City, Too Slow to Ride) makes the whole experience much better."
5,Strange record,"Jazz Times just called Nels Cline the most dangerous guitarist in the world. The trio records show Cline building the foundation for such an assessment. The trio records are probably more a group effort, more of a result of gigging on aregular basis than the music that was/is to follow. It would be interesting to see where the trio might have gone given Cline's ever increasing confidence. Perhaps his new Nels Cline Singers group will pick up these pieces.This one is very strong- get it!"
3,Not for everyone.,Big and bulky; you have to really work with this pillow until you find your comfort zone. Took it apart (into two horizontal pieces) which made it more manageable.Not for everyone.
5,American Textile Cotton Body Pillow,I bought this body pillow for my son who loves it. I'm going to be purchasing two more. One for my husband and one for myself. It is the most wonderful pillow I have ever used. I wish I would have discovered it years ago.
5,Excellent Value,"At $7.99 this is a great item, which is difficult to find in linen stores. The case is a beautiful, deep navy color with a white zipper. Linens & Things charges $15.00 for a similar product. Definitely worth the price."
4,Better than I thought,"The color is a nice deep red - hinging on purplish. Fabric nothing special, but overall better than I thought it would be.The zipper is white, which is pretty disappointing, but if you're just looking to cover a body pillow w/ a modest cover, this will do the trick (and it's a lot cheaper than all the other body pillowcases out there)."
