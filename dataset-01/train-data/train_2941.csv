2,Stick to the other Simon works,"Pure pulp, and not in a good way. This is the Green series to avoid IMHO. Reads like a cheesy SyFy low budget movie."
5,wew this is a great cd,i just want to say that if you think that this is not good you are misslead this ia sweet stuff right here
4,No clones here,"A great band with a huge future...their sound is unique, vocally strong and most songs have really great lyrics. Paperthin Hymn is awesome. Other good songs: The Feel Good Drag, Symphony of the Blase, Audrey Start the Revolution. If I could give it another 1/2 star i would :)"
4,I was in their Fuse Video..YEAH!,"So I went to see Anberlin when they came to Town with Saosin, Code Seven, and Acceptance. At the time the only band I knew was Saosin. But I was blown away by Anberlins performance. They bring lots of enegery and great sounds to the stage, while the kids brought the mosh. On top of their show being awsome, Fuse TV was there filming them for a video. I was like ""WOW"", yeah it was an awsome time, and I now and most definitly an Anbelin fan. This album is great, the songs are uplifting and will get you out of that bad mood that you're probaly in. The best song is Stationary, but all of them are good."
5,5 stars absolutely,"god i absolutely fell in love with this band when i saw them live and now own all thier c,ds , they are just great"
5,Anberlin is amazing,"I got a few cd's really cheap (& free) at the Warped Tour this summer, & 2 of the songs i got were Anberlin, & I immediately fell in love. They have catchy tunes, great lyrics, and are overall fantastic. buy this, you won't regret it."
5,totally underatted,"This refreshing release from the so called ""christian"" label is outstanding. Beautiful melodies in stationary, stationary will just make you fall in love w/ this. Not to mention the little alternative style in dance dance christa paffgen. If it was a shorter song i would play it on a popular station thats plays yellowcard and all that kind of stuff. Definetly worth buying and they should be on the map but maybe they'll break the line with a future realease!also taking back sunday fans look to see if anberlin and tbs are in concert close to youre area."
2,It sucks,"Anberlin fails. The band delivers a heartless look at relationships and the music follows suit with a half sincere attempt. The problem with this cd is it is white noise alternative rock, as is there decision do release a ton of these songs on purevolumes webpage ahead of time. Just give it one listen and from a bit torrent site. Don't waste your money. If you want good alternative rock turn to modest mouse or third eye blind if you like that poppy sound anberlin is shooting for."
3,It's alright on first listen,"I'm not wowed on the first listen of this album but I do plan on listening to it a couple more times in the hopes that something will stick. It's not bad or anything just nothing that I can see myself listening to over and over and over again..yet. We'll see. I'll definitely be keeping it when I need music in the background but don't want to be distracted by it.Oh, I'm generally an Anberlin fan. I'm guessing this isn't their best album though."
5,Tremendously informative,"This book concisely explained the probable causes of anti-Semitism. Lindemann was careful to acknowledge that by attempting to understand anti-Semitism, one can misinterpret this to mean accept it in some way. Anti-Semitism is never an acceptable expression but by understanding why it has occurred perhaps steps can be taken to prevent its future occurrence.If you don't have a lot of time but want to better understand this troubling issue, I can't imagine a better book to read."
1,ripoff,Way overpriced. This vendor should probably return to their previous job of robbing the poor box at the church or stealing candy from babies.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this printer at the time I had Windows 98. And since I bought my new computer with Windows XP, it doesn't even work. I sent a letter to Visoneer telling them that there software I downloaded online does not work, and I want my money back. They said that they will give me 20% off my next scanner if I sent this one in. I DONT WANT NO MORE VISONEER PRODUCTS!!! I waisted my money."
1,This scanner sucks!,"I've never been able to use this scanner. I'm getting the same error message, that the scanner is hardware locked. However, there is no external lock anywhere on the box. The Visioneer website is useless, has no email contact, no 800 tech support number. They have a long distance tech support # which I've waited on hold, twice, for 30 min then gave up. I'd avoid this company like the plague."
3,5820 works with effort,"But you need to REMOVE THE 5820 DRIVERS and install the 5800 series drivers. The 5820 is supposed to have some neat stuff to scan 35mm negatives, but if you can live without it, we have had good luck with it just working with both '98 and XP Pro"
2,Can you scan negative pictures?,I was told from where I bought it from that I could scan negative prints on this scanner but I don't know how to do it. Is that a true statement? Can some one help me?
1,SCAM,"This product receives an ""F"". No tech support. Updateddrivers do not work. Spent time installing & uninstalling.Got mine from Gateway computer package purchase.Will not suggest you get one. It worked a couple of timestil this ""Unlock"" error came up. I have XP OS and it is supposedto be compatible. What a rip off! If you see one on sale,(5800 0r 5820 Visioneer) RUN AWAY!!FAST!! I have a MicrotekScanMaker X6 - it works alot better."
1,Poor Help from Manufacturer,"I get no e-mail nor toll free support. Received a Xmas gift, and trying to install it several times -- logo comes up on task bar w/red X meaning it cannot connect. I learned that this scanner has problems installing with Windows 98 second edition under certain conditions (AMD processor, certain USB ports, etc.). Why isn't this noted somewhere on the box, or at least on inside instructions. Too, installation instructions I got on internet did not correspond w/Adobe accrobat instructions, & the latter had totally blacked the illustrations which could have been of some help. Scanner still not installed & ""Sara"" understands nothing I ask about."
4,"Challenging - yes, Entertaining - hmmm","The visuals are remarkable and the composition is stirring but this is not ""easy"" listening. I am not sure how often I will dig up the DVD, although I will show Richard Dawkins saying ""machine, chine, chine..."" to my ""bright"" buddies, but the CD does work on it's own.I really envy the people who saw this live."
4,The one man woman is gone without a trace......,"10 years ago I thaught Miliria would rule at least the next deacade. Now she's nowhere to be found, or.... Does anyone have a clue. I treasure her both albums. In a time when Motown had it's most difficult days Milira gave real soul to their catalogue."
2,Gauge warning,"This product seems of good quality, and the price has it squarely below other ""0"" gauge wires on the market. I would like to say that the outer diameter of the insulation is of 0 gauge diameter, however the inner conductors are closer to that of 4 gauge. I have some high quality 0 gauge wire, and put the ends up next to each other and it is not even a close comparison on the diameter of the conductors. It is still fine in my application because I am not drawing a TON of power, but beware if you are looking at this kit to pull massive power (ie. 2000W of amplifiers) as it would likely be unsafe to do so."
4,looks good,"i recently got this product in the mail. it seems to be good stuff, though i haven't installed it yet. i am unsure of the material used to make the wire for the cable itself. everything was included as promised, however, you may want to purchase aGSI GTP20 RCA 2 Channel Twisted Pair Audio Cable with Aluminum Shield, Gold Plated RCA Connector (20 ft , Blue)for the signal itself. the thing is only $8.99 w/free 2 day shipping for prime users. wo0t! good value for the price."
2,garden shears,"these are sturdy shears, but I give them a work out. they became dull pretty quickly and because of rivet construction, sharpening them is difficult if not impossible."
4,An excellent CD,"As the previous reviewer said, these guys are like Mogwai. More so than GYBE in my oppinion. For comparison, Godspeed are alot darker and tend to focus more on a tense brooding strings/guitar combo. Sword's have a far more relaxing sound and tend to place less emphisis on specific instruments.I ordered this EP on the strength of the track 'A new assasin' which you can hear in its entirety on the epitonic.com site.After hearing the full thing, A new assasin is probably my favorite and is the closest they get to standard rock.Apparently there is also a self released live albumn as well, but I have no idea where/if you can get it.Rush out and grab this EP!"
4,Hide And Shriek,"This book is about a girl named Randy that moves to Fear Street. She hears people talking about some guy named Pete and Randy wonders why people are always talking about Pete. Randy soon finds out about Pete, and if she isn't careful, she might be the next ghost of Fear Street. This was a really good book but I don't think it's the best GOFS book that R.L. Stine wrote."
2,Horrible writing style,"The author clearly knows his Chinese history, there's no denying that. But this was a difficult and boring read, especially for someone like myself who has a layman's interest in the subject. He writes in an unnecessarily complicated and academic prose, full of extravagantly worded concepts that probably could've been more simplistically explained. Only other history professors can fully appreciate the writing style."
4,Pleased,This product arrived two days before the estimated delivery date. It was as described and in perfect condition. The only reason I don't give five stars is that my dragon is refusing to eat the food so far.
5,Engaging and relevant on many levels,"I couldn't put the book down. I finished reading it in record time. I loved the narration from different perspectives and how it filled in the characters' thought bubbles.As a coach I found the characters reluctance to follow through on their instincts frustrating, but that's something I deal with in the real world all the time (with myself too).I also appreciated the sentiment in the acknowledgements where it was mentioned that it is more important to be a better person than writer."
1,Did we read the same book?,"Admittedly I read the Pre-pub which may have errors etc but honestly this was one of the poorest written books I have even read. The characters are one dimensional, the situations are questionable, there are gaps in time that don't make sense and events just pop up with no real rhyme and/or reason.I started this book months ago and read two books while I put this one down out of sheer disinterest. I picked it up again while waiting for my next book to arrive and finished it just on principle.I would NOT recommend it to anyone. Flat, boring and uninteresting. I couldn't care less about any of the characters and was happy to finish and didn't want one more page...not a good sign!"
5,Incredible!,I actually bought this book because it had a catching cover. I purcahased it on a whim- and it really was worth the money. The story of Jack and Conner was so well written and addictive I want to read it over and over again! I look forward to more boks by Shari!
3,Disappointing,"It was definitely a very fast read, but the writing was filled with cliches like creamy pink skin and apple cheeks. And I never met a teenage boy so obsessed with being in love with his first lay. Plus even the characters described as super-smart were inarticulate."
1,I wouldn't read this book again,The charaters are flat and under-developed. Author has depressing out look on life.
3,Neither here nor there,"This was a mindless read. Not very well written or original, but it went by quickly and kept me absorbed a lot of the time."
4,better,"kids listen to way to much music that has no feeling to it at all today. these guys may not be musical geniuses, but they have more heart and soul for rock and punk music than most bands out their. to really understand these guys you have to understand where their coming from, these guys probobly didnt start a band to change rock and roll history, they started a band to rock. and they do. and thats why they are great. with all that pop punk garbage that floats around in the radio, getting an even bigger hold on kids heads that have no idea what kind of other music is out there, these guys are what punk is. mall punkers have no idea. go break dead srv's guitar and then get back to me on what punk is.tracks:love is happinessfeed a cat to your cobra"
1,Blows Goats,"These guys are a joke. A total absolute waste of time. The singer wishes he was Mike Jagger but he does not possess the stage presence, intellegence or talent to be such. This whole band is a total joke. I cannot stress this enough. I saw them open for A Perfect Circle and I laughed my .... off at them for the first 20 minutes of the setlist. They were so bad that the crowd started flipping them off...surely that tells you not to buy this garbage."
4,I like it !,"...If you like Molly Hatchet, Lynyrd Skynyrd & the Allman Bros. and good 'ol southern rock...you'll like Doc Holliday. Doc Holliday's CD ""Rides Again"" is also good !"
5,A page turner,"Fantastic read. It follows the path of a young marine who goes from green to being an old salt. It gives you an idea of what went on then, and by all accounts in the news, now. I honestly didn't want the book to end because I met so many different personalities and takes on what war is like. At the same time I wanted them all out of there."
3,Memory Lane,"This DVD brought back the old memories of Christmas celebrations I enjoyed as a child through the use of black and white cartoons, old movies, songs, and Christmas TV specials. The most entertaining of the entire collection is Ozzie and Harriett. These folks can still bring laughter and fun to your heart. The collection can be enjoyed by the young and old and will take many down memory lane. Grab a copy for a stocking stuffer or for a that ""special"" group that hangs out during the holidays and complains that they're bored. It will liven up any snowy day and keep 'em coming back for more!"
2,The Christmas Collection,"This set is just ""o.k."" The main problem is that the description said it contained ""Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer."" What it doesn't say is that it is not the classic TV version that we all associate with the story. Instead, it's a brief cartoon of the story. Since this was the reason I chose this collection, I was disappointed. There are some entertaining programs on the video, but it was not what we expected. We wouldn't have purchased it if we'd veiwed it first."
1,NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL CLASSIC CHRISTMAS CARTOONS,"I was extremely disappointed in this collection. I have never seen ANY of the Christmas cartoons that were included and believe me I've seen a bunch of them.One thing's for sure, they were not your (my) traditional version of classic Christmas cartoons.I got them and sent it back them back all in the same day."
3,Something for (just about) everyone,"For under 10 bucks you get three dvds. One has movies, the second has tv shows and the third has cartoons, all with a Christmas theme. I most enjoyed the rarely shown TV version of Miracle on 34th Street (with Uncle Billy as Kris Kringle) and the almost forgotten Beyond Tomorrow, both on the movie disc. I also got a big kick out of the Bev Hillbillies, Burns and Allen, and Jack Benny episodes on the TV disc. Picture quality varies from feature to feature (don't expect restored prints at these prices) but even so, you'll find hours of holiday entertainment for next to nothing. So, if you're over 40, go for it! Enjoy and Merry Christmas."
2,Still using film?,"The book has some good information still, but even though it's only a couple of years old (2003 I think), the pictures just seem as if they are from the late 80's or early 90's. And they're all VERY GRAINY!!! You can tell by her experiences that she knows what she's talking about and she is very talented, but I just think it's a bit out of date for today's wedding photographer. Good thing I got mine for under $3. If you're just getting started in the business, I would actually recommend you get this book (if you can get it as cheaply as I did) and use it to compare to other books you read. It actually can help you figure out which shots NEVER to do..."
5,"Two Words, Kids...","Two words, kids .... Hyun Bin.And not to take anything away from the terrific Korean actress, Kim Sun Ah, who portrays the title character in this beloved Korean perennial (and available on Netflix btw in case you just want to dip your toes in) because she is wonderful, from start to finish. But once you've invited Hyun Bin into your lifeboat, isn't the rest of the pitching and rolling voyage all about how to keep him hydrated and looking fresh?? HB is the undisputed poster boy of my as-yet unwritten series, ""The Compulsively Watchable Koreans."" I came to K-dramas late, but like all recent converts to religion, I am fanatic and prone to button-holing strangers in the street to sing the praises of Lee Jun Ki in ""Iljimae"" or Ji Sung in ""Save The Last Dance For Me."" If you haven't already discovered them, run don't walk to the nearest one. You'll be addicted in no time, just like me."
5,You Need to Watch This! :),"I have just started getting into Korean dramas/comedies after a friend suggested that I watch this. It is absolutely hilarious! I am so happy that I have been turned on to Korean mini-series & movies. This show was funny, engaging, and real. I could empathize with Sam-Soon throughout the show. I am happy that I saw this and look forward to watching many more!"
5,"Good Drama , LOve it","the drama are pretty interesting . but i don't really like the ending , i was hoping the other way around."
2,Too stupid to believe.,I did not like her character nor did I feel there was any real chemistry there.
5,She's a panther - Rroww!,This is definitely a must-buy and I would recommend this dvd series to everyone i.e. non-Koreans. There's never a dull or false moment but don't bother picking up German Michael Ende's Momo which is just futile money policy propaganda.
5,Worth owning,"This is a rather nice comedic K-Drama. While the main character struggles with her weight and love life, she is never really without resources. You will laugh at her antics, but also admire her determination and business savvy. There is nothing much I can say that hasn't been said in previous reviews, but I have to mention the really nice packaging by YAentertainment! It also contains a mouse pad as a bonus.Looking forward to the main actress' new work, to be released this fall by YA!, ""City Hall."""
5,Great drama,i lovee the drama. it skipped twice on a couple of discs. other than that it played great
4,Seal & Shine,"Although I originally received the wrong item (due to an error in the product code number), the company was most helpful in correcting the error. The are now sending the correct product at no additional cost."
4,WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD,not much to say about a gasket set this one was good quality work ad it should would have been better if they sent someone to install it too.
3,I don't like ceramic knives,"Is the second time I give a chance to the kyocera ceramic knives. I have a very big collection of kitchen knives and the ceramic has nothing to do against good quality knives and a good sharpener. No way. Even the knife works, even a standart Global knife is much better. The original japanese handcrafted and german cutterly are a better option. In case you know how to use the knives buy a japanese original model, a vegetables one, a deba and sushi knife. If you want a good balanced, a small global petty for peeling and a G4 for all the rest."
4,"BEAUTIFUL, CUTS LIKE BUTTER","Saw a program on TV about the Kyocera knives and knew I had to have one. Was very excited when my new knife arrived and knew I had to be extra careful, as it is VERY sharp. It was my decision to only cut soft food with my knife as I didn't want to run the chance of dulling it and even though it is strong, felt a steel blade could do the ""hard stuff"". Even though I cut soft foods, one day when chopping parsley I noticed a chip in the blade. Was so disappointed but after reading the warrantee I returned the knife after only having it for 30 days. Instead of re-sharpening the knife, which I didn't care for, they sent me a brand new knife. I am again in ""action"" and even though I have confidence in the knife, I will still check continuously for any chips."
2,Super sharp but they break,This is the third knife I've bought and broken in 18 months. They are amazingly sharp but fragile. They just don't stand up to everyday use.
1,"fragile,brittle and not of much use in the kitchen","I have had two of these knives the first I purchased because I saw an infomercial on ceramic knives. The second was a replacement knife for the first that broke when i was cutting a roast-the blade simply shattered for no reason other than it is not a durable product. The replacement broke under similar circumstances performing the kind of task that you buy a kitchen/chef's knife for. I would've given this product no star rating but that isn't an option.If you're going for a good knife for the kitchen buy a steel knife,ceramic stinks!"
3,So-so marks for this knife,"I recieved aq small paring knife as a gift and I really like it. This spurred me to try out the Kyocera 6"" Chef's Knife. I didn't like this at all! It was too light-weight for my use, didn't have enough ""heft"". I also did not like the fact that I would have to send it in to be sharpened. That just seemed like too much trouble. All-in-all, I decided to return the knife and stick with what I had."
3,"Fine book, but out of date","This is a very well-written, clear, and (so far as I know) comprehensive explanation of what it is intended to describe. The problem is that it seems to be many years out of date. The copyright is last given as 1998, but the content includes anachronisms from even earlier, the most glaring of which is that all the world maps are marked with the USSR. This leads me to doubt a lot of other information in the book, such as ""current"" trends in European air traffic control and the global reach of LORAN-C. Still, I doubt that the basic systems described have changed that much in the intervening years. It does have INS and GPS."
5,Navigation for navigators or would-be navigators,"Navigational concepts are presented at a high level and in a thorough manner. Although a good grounding in navigational principles is helpful to get the most out of it, even a novice will be curious to learn more. As a former ship's navigator and aircraft pilot of 35 years, I learned more from this book than any before. The authors' explanation of the principles of long range navigation and their description of how GPS works are the best I ever read. It is so clearly written that anyone can get something out of it, with or without a technical background. I have used this book to teach navigation to university students and to Civil Air Patrol cadets."
4,What does it take to be a good air navigator?,"This book is a very comprehensive picture of what every pilot should knowabout navigation. A clear, easy language and thorough explanations of basics and navigation rules makes it easy for everyone, even like me who just begins the flying adventure."
4,Highly Recommend !!,"Very Satisfied, Fast, Condition of Book was Good - I would use this seller again."
5,These really are the 250 best muffin recipes!,"I have always loved muffins but had never been much of a baker. One day while browsing through my local bookstore I spotted exactly what I needed to get me to start baking, a muffin cookbook! I went out to get the few ingredients I needed and started baking. I could not believe how easy it was. From that day foreword I became an avid muffin maker. This book is not only easy but has great recipes. Even my kids have started making them with me since their is a speical kid's section in the book. The variety of choices makes them want to cook as well as me. I congratulate Ms. Brody on an excellent book!"
3,Hotei Encyclopedia,"Useful for a beginning collector but the various essays do not provide new information. An in depth discussion of reprints and how to identify old, early impressions is really needed. The historical background is readily available elsewhere. The list of artist's signatures, publisher's seals and date seals is very useful."
5,need to have tools,"this is a great combo. all in one, the set has tools that you will use all the time. they have a good weight and although they're a little chunky, work marvelously"
5,The Best of Saint-Saens,"I recieved this CD as a Christmas present and I have been listening to it fairly consistently since. Saint-Saens has made my list of favorite classical composers because his music has the ability to tell stories, and cover wide ranges of emotions in a single piece. My absolute favorite track from this CD is the ""Bacchanale"", for its lively orchestration and toe-tapping ""dance-til-you-drop"" rhythms. I also especially enjoy the ""Carnival of the Animals"" segment; each beautifully orchestrated piece is arranged so well, one can often tell which animal it represents without having to double-check the index on the back of the CD. Finally, among other great works of this composer, the CD also includes the undisputed best version of the famous ""Danse Macabre"" that I have ever heard in my life. I give this beautiful, addictive CD a HUGE thumbs up!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"We ordered two versions of ""Carnival of the Animals"" at the same time and this one was a disappointment because the music is meaningless without the wonderful poetry of Ogden Nash. The Boston Pops recording is much better because it does include the brief narrative that introduces each segment."
5,Essential Shawn Mullins,"Outstanding collection of songs by an artist who deserves a lot more attention than he's received. There's a mixture of blues, folk, earthy tones along with good old fashioned rock and roll. Get this album........it will become a favorite in short time!"
3,Shawn Mullins - Decent American Singer Songwriter,"Mullins is best known for his huge hit single ""Lullaby"" from the late 90's. That was pretty much the only thing I knew of him until I saw him open for the Indigo Girls a few years ago. I was impressed enough with his show to go out and pick up this compilation album. I don't own any of his studio albums, so I don't know how representative this is, but it seems to be a decent compilation. Mullins is a singer / songwriter who seem to specialize in acoustic oriented songs in the tradition of many who have come before him. His lyrics don't blow me away, but are decent enough. Overall the album is a pleasant listen and Mullins is an enjoyable writer. The album contains two versions of his bit hit Lullaby, the original single along with an acoustic version. There is also a cool duet of Border Song with Elton John."
2,You cannot trust the pronunciation instructions.,"This book is good for learning basic Vietnamese vocabulary for the price and size.However, I found a few grammatical mistakes.And the pronunciation instructions are horrible. For example, I don't understand why all the beginning c is instructed to pronounce as g. In fact the c sounds k. The pronunciation of ""cam on"", thanks in English, is shown [gam urn]. If you say like this, Vietnamese people never understand you. I have tried it already. My husband is a Vietnamese who speaks tieng Viet."
3,no need to use it.,"You can easily get by in Vietnam using Enlish and a few Vietnamese phrases. If you're planning an extended stay, it's probably better to properly learn Vietnamese."
2,More Dictionary than Phrasebook--not useful,"I usually don't bother to review things unless they are an outlier to my expectations, which this book was. I'm actually in Vietnam now, and I have not cracked this thing once. Of the 250 pages in the book, the only phrasebook part of it was pp 13-27. The rest of it is a dictionary with a menu reader at the end. Not recommended unless you are looking for a dictionary."
3,Review from a Vietnamese who teaches Vietnamese on Sundays,"After looking at the pages that are available, I'd say you'd be better off showing your intended audience the pages rather trying to say them as the instructions are terrible.I give the book 3 stars instead of 1 because its size is convenient for traveling, and it does have what you need in case you're lost somewhere."
2,Don't buy it,"When this scanner works it does a fair job. Prepare to listen to LOTS of noise and lots of scans with nothing but a black strip in the center of the output.More importantly it is now obsolete and out of production.I had to reinstall Windows XP and was never able to get the scanner to work again. The Visioneer technical support is no help either. It tells you to call a toll number and then you also pay 2 dollars a minute on top of the toll charge. The web site has updates, none of which help.Check with Microsoft to see what WIA drivers XP has to use for scanners and you will NOT see Visioneer on the list.Stay away from Visioneer and it's out of production models."
2,Disappointed!,This is my second Visioneer scanner. I bought this one specifically for its 35mm slide scanning capability. I have followed all of the instructions for software/hardware installation (I used both Windows Me and XP) for USB and still the slide/transpancy feature does not work! Quality of the scanning for color prints lacks sharpness as compared to the Epson/HP scanners that I have used. Will consider Epson or Canon next time.
1,The scanner I received had obviously been used.,"The scanner I received had obviously been used. Worse yet it was ship unlocked (there is a lock on the bottom to keep the scanner in alignment during shipping). Tech Depot was good about taking it back and even sent a UPS label to return it. At the moment the scanner is in transit, hopefully I won't have any difficulties with the credit back to my credit card"
2,Cancelling an order I just placed today,"I ordered it today and have been trying to cancel the order and order something else but because it's ""shipping soon"" I can't cancel the order over the internet. I can be reached at:<"
3,Seeing Amazon's prices I'm sick.,"I bought one from aol shop direct brand new lost the PaperPort Deluxe Driver Disk.I payed more than I want to say because everybody will want me to buy prime farm ground on the bottom of the Mississippi River.The prices on Amazon are great.It is not much of a review butI never had the chance to use it much.I hope I don't get in trouble for saying this,but I buy something and they would try to sell me the samething five more times in the same year."
4,An overlooked gem,"This novel was an unexpected delight! I read it because of my acquaintance with its author, Sheldon Greene but I am recommending it strictly on account of its merit. Narrated by a Holocaust survivor, it concerns the triumphs and foibles of the Jewish community in a small town in Pennsylvania. It is written in the style of Sholem Aleichem and is, by turns, poignant, humorous and provocative. A small treasure!"
3,You can do better,"This is a nice book and it may allow a beginner to paint a pretty picture. It briefly discusses the basics -- paper, brushes, paints, some brush and masking methods. The problem lays in that the pictures will come out looking mechanically made (much like a child's watercolor) and the book provides no real basis for artistic growth after completing it.I am an absolute beginner: new to watercolor, new to painting, new to drawing and new to art. I need all the help I can get. This was the first watercolor book I brought. I put it aside to read another, and upon returning I was dismayed by how limited and dead-ended this book was. In fact, I now consider it a bit of a trap. I recommend choosing a more advanced beginner book -- you will go further faster, and still have room to grow."
5,Great Compact Model,"I have nothing but praise for this mighty little electric kettle. Boil water super fast, and has a very small footprint. Have had no trouble with it in 6 months+.(Note): I use this about 2-3 times a week."
5,ooooh sexxay!,"this single is very, very, sexy. lara croft singing about getting naked, every guys fantasy! if you love lara, or if you dont, this albums for you!"
4,Great book but too expensive,"It's good to read the book that the writer and inventor of theory are the same person. Glover and Laguna conduct this book in a self-comprehensive book. I've never found any good resource of Tabu Search as great as this book. Only drawback is the price... too expensive for student. I only read it in the library though. I'm glad to know they have the paperback edition but I'm not sure about the quality of printing. Lastly, get it whenver you can afford it!. It's worth your money every characters."
3,good to cut pvc and cpvc pipes,"It is excellent to cut pvc and cpvc pipes, but only thing is that you have to get back the edge side each time you cut any piece of pipe, by driving security nut left way and getting edge side at its cutting position. It doesn't get back at its position on automatic."
3,Suzanne,"Need a blade for a ORBIT pvc cutter--cuts 1/2-1"" pvc. Can't find any blades anywhere. Good cutter, but blade doesn't hold up."
1,"I would rate this DVD ""Zero stars""","It is a home-made video, where the person with no medical education tries to teach you MEDICAL hypnosis. I am not sure he knows the basics of anatomy, physiology and/or pathology. The movie is very unprofessional. Quality of the video is very poor. The content is not the same as the title. The title is what sells this DVD, but not the DVD itself.This DVD was a complete waste of my money. Unfortunately, Amazon does not refund the money for opened DVDs. It is sad that Amazon even accepts items for sale like this one. But if you still want to waste your money for this DVD, I will sell it to you for $5 (all it's worth).I can recommend: ""Heal Yourself With Medical Hypnosis: The Most Immediate Way to Use Your Mind-Body Connection!"" by Andrew Weil, MD, and Steven, Ph.D. Gurgevich (Audio CD - September 2005)Svetlana B., MSOM, Acupuncture Physician"
1,After I waited forever to recieve this,"I finally get this dvvd that I purchased and come to find out, it is a dvdr from someones home computer. It is a home made video. Not to mention they put in flyers for r&b music and other various junk. Do not purchase this product if you are looking for real medical hypnosis."
1,u have sent the wrong game,"I requested a purchase of the special adition, but what i recieved was the regular Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas"
1,Disappointing,"Everybody loves this game, and I can't figure out why. It's almost impossible to get money, you die far to easy, and the missions are tedious; hoo boy lets get a haircut...good times. I played True Crime and it was soo much better than this. Maybe I didn't play it long enough, maybe I just suck royally at this game, but I didn't think it owned up to its fame"
3,Filter cartridge not the one shown.,"I was expecting the filter cartridge shown. the image clearly shows the internal strainer which also acts as a support for the filter pleats so they don't collapse under high pressure. What I got was a filter cartridge that requires an additional purchase of a center insert which does the same job as the original strainer insert. Still a perfectly good filter cartridge, it just requires an additional part, it would have been nice to know that BEFORE I ordered the cartridges, not when I get the cartridges and then have to order the darn insert."
1,you should not offer what you cannot deliver!,My wife had ordered this plus the 1 inch size for me at the begining of February. I got the 1 inch size in but the 3/4ths size bit is nowhere to be seen! I find this very frustrating! The website now has this item as discontinued or not stocked. There seems to be no insight as to when and If I will ever see this bit. This was my first online purchase and it will most likely be my last.
2,Fragile Clamp,"The light itself was fine, but the clamp hinge is very fragile plastic.Mine broke after only a few times moving the light from place to place."
4,Good introduction to Goldilocks,"My toddler loves reading ""Ricitos de Oro,"" and now ""reads"" it to herself using the different voices of the bears. The translation isn't perfect, but it is a nice simple story. As she is getting older, she is curious to hear the story in English and Spanish, so it is nice to have both versions on the same page."
3,"Good Music, Bad Recording.","I actually stumbled onto Janine playing a live concert on a local cable channel. I only caught the end, so all I heard was ""It should be me"" and ""Made to fade"". I was impressed. In fact, I think the live versions were better than what's on this album. Janine Wilson has a husky, deep, and extremely sensuous voice. That said, this is an OK album. The music is not bad, with the two songs already mentioned being the best. Unfortunately, I find the recording quality on this album to be iffy. For lack of a better description, there seems to be a dull haze over the recording. It sounds kind of flat. This is unfortunate, for I really like Janine's voice and I find the poor recording quality to be very distracting. Pity."
4,4 songs missing from orignal lp,"I loved the LP title Lucille Talks Back in 1975? but I no longer have it ....so I will buy this CD although it is missing 4 songs from the LP and has 6 songs that were not on the LP and yet it says ""original release"". The 2 wah wah songs are on here -thankfully- and they get 5 stars"
4,They're hot pads...,"The heat doesn't get through them and that's good. They are a bit floppy though which makes them a little awkward to work with at times but generally, they're ok."
2,Hot pads,I find these hot pads are hard to keep a grip on ---- I prefer themore traditional quilted pads.
2,No...,"I am an enormous fan of the works of Vivaldi and was rather pleased to find this CD in a pile a friend gave me. I listened to the three sections of ""Spring"" and was sadly disappointed. The music had no emotion, no flair, and the mixing of the audio was rather bad. The joy that the spring section is supposed to convey was absent. Technically well done, but that is only the half of what should be there. Each piece is rather under tempo and the soloists seem to have taken some improvisational liberties with some parts, in a poor direction. I could not finish my favorite, the Largo section of Winter, simply because it was not well done in my opinion."
5,great product,"these fender trims look fantastic on my 05 yukon! great fit and easy installation, the contour was perfect and shipping was fast! couldnt be any happier!"
3,10 Original Decca Hits,"A budget priced set with some hard to find sides. All of the music here sounds great except for the Chuck Berry song ""Thirty days"" and ""Boogie Woogie Baby"". These 2 songs are noticably taken from the original 78 rpm discs complete with surface noise. Aside from that it is still a good sampler from the Texas Troubadour."
2,Picture is misleading!,"This set does include the 4 spark plug wires, however the picture shows that it comes with the coil wire as well. Will have to order and wait on the coil wire now. Very disappointing."
2,Does not come with the 5th wire you see in the picture.,"these kinda fit, but they do not come with the 5th wire you see in the picture, pretty miss leading and item description does not say much about how many wires are included. i bought these from amazon, didnt know they would be like this."
4,Great replacement wires for the price,"Regular wires, Great for replacing on wires on a Honda, which was 10 years old (Honda brands mark the year on the wire). These bosch wires are longer than OEM so you need to do some tricky routing to the cap in order not to have too much slack at the end. Also make sure the connector plug to the cap is long enough so it will stay in the cap."
5,The Bevis Frond is original one of a kind music.,"Great album by founder and lead guitarist Nick Salomon, bass guitarist Ade Shaw of Hawkwind fame, and drummer Andy Ward formaly of Camel. I had the chance to see this tour in a small venue in Portland, Oregon. I had never heard of Bevis Frond, but Andy Ward is from my favorite band Camel and I had to see him play. The music was awesome, a mixture of psychodelic, feedback, blues, and folk, with some english humour thrown in and lots of heart. Nick is a master songwriter and introduces many of the songs on this CD. This gives the listener a sense of knowing a lot about Nick and where he is coming from.The live album brought back great memories of the show. The opening song Hole Song #2 has a great guitar lick which is unforgetable and my favorite tune, Stone Trained Driver has an original set of lyrics that will make you smile."
4,Great Cd,"This album is full of imaginative, creative and original sounds. It's a unique blend of rap and pleasant melodies, and it's a refreshing change from the likes of ultra aggressive white rap groups such as limp bizkit, kid rock and Eminem. I highly reccomend this for any listener with a discerning ear for something new and fresh."
3,Par20 LED,"The LED lights were received promptly and were in excellent condition. However, the lights worked but were not as bright as 40 watt Halogens I needed in my garage where I wanted to replace florescent tube lights. They would serve in some cases but no where could I find a light output comparison to other lighting. I did not use them long enough to check out the lifetime."
2,"if you love giveing your $ away,for all leds as of now","we have$ 395.00 of this so called save u $$ and the big bad ball that we all live on!,LED bulbs, by the whay all but some HAVE STOPED WORKING,we have a lot of CYRON,s led bulbs as of now a lot of them do not work !and IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR THEM TO STOP !!!at 10.00,two 30.00 a bulb ,u be giveing a lot of $$ to cyron,that is fine if u do not care to give your $$away,but we can not do that ! but i think we did ?give $ to keep the big bad ball we all live on,and to help make led,s last and cyron $,we have some that do work very well!!! and love the fake look of the gu10,s and the halogens,we do not have the incandesscent bulbs BILLS,so all of it is a 2"
4,Excellent Instrumentation Text,"As others have already stated, This is an excellent text on instrumentation - information about any instrument you're liable to encounter. Octave ranges, tunings, fingering charts, myriad examples of techniques particular to varied instruments used in scores - generally anything you would want to know about instrumentation without actually learning how to play all the instruments discussed. By comparison, the orchestration chapters are a little thin. Of course, it could be argued that orchestration/arranging is a more or less intuitive skill that can be honed by studying the full scores of others - however, a more in-depth resource for orchestration/arranging is probably out there. But again, an excellent reference manual for instrumentation. it is a little on the expensive side for what you get, as it is a textbook."
3,So-so,"The author should have actually said this is a book on instrumentation. There are few samples of orchestration and nothing as helpful as a CD of samples. For orchestration you should look elsewhere. For instrumentation it is fairly useful but it does contain errors, one of which is the listed transposition for the Alto Saxophone, which is wrong. One would hope that if someone puts out a book on instrumentation that the basic facts would be correct. Perhaps talking to an instrumentalist would be more useful but the section on the strings is quite decent."
4,"Its a good ring, seems high quality but..","I bought this ring as a wedding ring and from the online picture it looks like the top surface is matte. But its actualy mirror polish..so it looks like a disco ball on your hand. Not a bad thing I guess but its not what I was going for. Other then that, great product I suppose and they shipped quickly, just doesn't look like what I thought I was buying."
4,3.5 Stars,"The funereal overture ""Transcendence"" yields to the power goth of ""Mirrors"" and it's readily apparent Havayoth are not lighting a fire under the ass of originality here. However, if there's one thing that's been proven time and again since the dawn of music, it's that melody, when done right, can be endlessly milked from now until eternity without getting old. ""His Creation Reversed"" is chock full of melody, with not a loser in the bunch, and in fact ""Teloah"" is a downright classic. ""Teloah"" runs on the longest of the nine tracks, but in the old days of vinyl and cassette the artistic move was to relegate the middle of the album to transitionary songs, a sort of musical intermission, and that's exactly what's achieved here. Havayoth have a way of combining atmosphere with actual songs that initially makes you think they're a bit more brilliant than they probably are, but it's worth it for that initial breathless first impression."
4,You've been away for such a long time now...,"This mid-90's, one-woman sketch comedy was very funny and original. Ullman's characters were a riot and very likeable while the format is a five-minute monologue from each one with no real interaction with any other characters. Ning Nong Nang, the Vietnamese donut-store owner delivers hers at the end of a long day in the kitchen with her bare feet resting in the next days' donut batter! The crude but sincere Aussie stunt-woman is a treat as is the even more vulgar Middle-Eastern taxi driver."
5,Brilliant!,"I loved it, some characters more than others. I can't get enough of the Rosenthals and Ruby Romaine (what a hoot!). Others I could skip, but overall, extremely clever and funny. The range of characters she can do is just amazing."
1,Very low volume,"I recently purchased the BT320s. I have a Nokia E61i phone. Pairing with my phone was not an issue. However, at the highest volume, the sound is fairly low. I use my own headset. So beware, if you use your own headset. Headset impedance (mine is 32 ohms, which is fairly low) was too high for the BT320s."
1,It didn't work!!!,"They sent me a second one and it didnt work either, asked for something else and never got it. So not only the product was crappy but service was horrible."
2,"Low volume, Intermittent sound, needs regular charging, died after 3 months of use","Low volume, Intermittent sound, needs regular charging, died after 3 months of useBought the device a couple of months. Works alright but find it very diffiult to hear when travelling on the tube. The product just died after 3 months of use!"
3,HIstoryfic or Ficthistory? Your call,"This is a fairly interesting book that has several problems. First, if you are an aviation fanatic, you've read most of this before. If you are not, the level of detail will probably bore your eyeballs out. Second, if you are serious about aviation, there is no explaination of who is real and who is fictional, which leads to a lot of wondering about third tier characters. And third, the worst part, is that there's no bibliography. We are all supposed to take, on faith, this massive brain dump from Col. Boyne and if we want to research something further, that's just tough luck. Especially if you're not sure if you agree with some things. Lastly, the Vance penchant for being in the right place gets a little old after a while, not to mention the magic ability to discern aircraft problems. Particularly since the Vances are so stupid about sex. And there's lot of sex here, I guess to keep the non-fanatics awake."
4,Shades of Monk,"If you like jazz, you must like Thelonious Monk. This CD has a nice selection of recordings, some solos, some with backup, and some live with great band members.For musical purists, he may be a little hard to listen to. But once you get past the intentional off-notes, you can feel the spirit with which this man played. It is, for the most part, happy music, free as a child would be romping through a musical landscape.That's how this music makes me feel."
5,"This is the best of Monk, but...","Monk is my absolute favorite, I have dozens of his albums and box sets. The quality on this CD is great, the song selections are great. The only thing I would recommend is that if you plan on buying more of Monk's recordings this ""Greatest Hits"" CD will kind of spoil it for your. You remember the best of the Eagles, Steve Miller Band, Beatles, Elvis whatever. You'll never want to buy another album because some of the songs will be on it. If you just discovered monk go get Mysterioso, Straight No Chaser or Monk's Blues. It's not like you'll find any bad tracks on those albums, so why just eat the frosting! I love that they are remixing all this great music!"
5,Exactly what I had in mind,This was my first foray into jazz piano and I was not disappointed. I've added this and the Best of Duke Ellington to my weekend morning's playlist.
2,Can't use it at edge,"These may be fine for your need, but I needed to hold up the liner along the edge, and these won't screw into my Accord's ceiling along the edge - too firm there. I'm skeptical they will screw in away from the edge, either."
2,Useless,"On the face of it, looks an excellent idea. What can go wrong with a bunch of pins, you may ask. Well these are quite useless. If you try to use these pins by pushing them in, they will bend. If you try screwing them in, (as the shape suggests), they still won't go in as they aren't sharp enough. I got tired of them and simply tore off the sagging headliner rather than deal with it getting in the face of passengers all the time,"
1,Failed Miserably on an '03 Dakota,"Ordered 2 packs of this to try and hold up the headliner in a 2003 Dodge Dakota. Most of the pins were bent on arrival. While most could be straightened, a few were completely useless right out of the box. The pins would not screw into the headliner board at all, nor could they be simply pushed in. All they did was bend. I would not recommend this at all. Some people have had success with this product, but my experience was terrible."
2,Headliner Repair,Did not work as easily as I had hoped but it worked until I could get the liner repaired. Did OK. Got what I asked for in a timely manner.
1,I couldn't recommend this to another,"I was leery of purchasing this scanner because of these reviews. But I thought the price was right. The scanner was basically dead on arrival. After it was installed I kept getting an error message that the scanner was locked. It was not locked. Visioneer's automated support web site brought this issue up with the first search, so it must be a common problem for this model. Their only recommendation is to ensure you have the right drivers ( I did) and to plug the unit directly to the wall outlet and not a power strip. Tried that. Their next solution is to return it to the dealer for exchange. I would say definitely do not buy this model."
1,"1st one died, the 2nd one is currently dying...","The first Visioneer scanner I bought died after a year. So stupid me, I decided to get another one. Now the 2nd one is starting to do weird things like not scanning, the customize window keeps popping up to 'customize' it again, and so on. In simple words, it is dying. Don't buy this product!"
1,"6 Months Later, Looking for a New Scanner","First of all, if you're a Mac user, don't even bother. Move on. This is not a Mac (OSX or 9) friendly scanner.When I tried it just out of the box, I was very happy with its performance. Now, however, I can't even get it to scan--this machine will only operate with its original power supply (although Visioneer will happily send you a new one for only [more money). This product is not for those with a tendency to lose things!It boils down to this: Decent hardware. Software is lacking. Very bulky scanner. Tech support is a bargain at $2 per minute (on this model)."
1,Lousy software = useless scanner,"AAAAAAAAGH!This scanner's optical qualities are great, the problem is the absolute piece of garbage that comes with it masquerading as scanner software. It's a pain to configure, and it's a pain to convert scanned images into the formats you want...for example, a simple JPEG format! Plus once the software is loaded, it automatically boots up every time you turn your PC on, which will add a good 15 seconds to your system boot-up time! Even more annoying is the fact that whenever you have it turned off, every time you insert a CD or floppy into your computer, it will make your PC search for the scanner connnection...there is NO way to turn this off!I found the scanner software for my Hewlett Packard all-in-one machine ten million times easier to use, and can't even begin to tell you how much I wish I had gone for an HP scanner instead.Stay well away from this piece of junk! I wish I could give this thing a BELOW ZERO star rating!"
4,This scanner is great for the price!,"I don't know what the heck everyone else is complaining about. I've had this scanner for more than two years and the only problem I've had is that I now have to jiggle the cord to get the power supply to stay on. That's probably because I've used the thing so darn much.I've scanned hundreds of pictures that came out extremely crisp and sharp and have used the TextBridge (OCR) software to scan chapters of books into Word.The software that comes with this Visioneer 8900 is definitely not intuitive but that's okay with me because I use Corel to do all my photo editing. All it takes is a little patience the first time to learn how to adjust the scanning quality and color. After that, it should be a breeze.One the downside - this scanner first came out three years ago so it's a bit bulky and there are slimmer, sleeker models now available. But, if you can purchase one used for about $30-$40, it's definitely worth it."
1,One Star because there is nothing less to give it.,"This is by far, the biggest piece of garbage that it has ever been my misfortune to buy. If everything Visioneer makes is like this, they deserve to go out of business. I cannot believe they can foist off this kind of junk and get by with it. I will never buy another product with 'Visioneer' on it. Period. This scanner was a HUGE waste of money, not to mention a very good source of frustration. It worked long enough to scan about 5 items...but none of those consequtively. It will scan one, then if you're lucky you might get another scan out if after about 25 hours of fooling with it and it's pathetic connections, (lots of luck getting any decent drivers or updates) and countless reboots of your computer. Buy a real scanner, send this one to your enemies."
2,Works OK till it works!!,"I bought it from a reseller and was easy to install and worked great for about 6 months and one day for no apparent reason I started getting ""The scanner optical module is locked"" error. Since then I have tried reinstalling drivers as well as software with no results. People I have read recommeding reisntalling OS. But to me if you have to reinstall the OS to make a scanner work, the piece is not worth having. I will just look for another scanner."
5,Menocchio...an important historical figure,"Ginzburg's study of the miller Menocchio is an invaluable view into the genre of Microhistory. He utilizes a great deal of sources to tease out the identity of this man, how he dealt with his world, and how is controversial views on religion and life ultimately led to his demise. If you haven't read this yet, you should. It's a quick read and very interesting."
4,Terrific insight!,"In the cheese and the worms, ginzburg gives terrific insight into how ones social status defines their belief system. It shows the interperative filters one uses based on what they know and are able to comprehend."
2,Slipshod speculations of a doctrinaire thinker,"Mr. Ginzburg's ""The Cheese and the Worms"" is destined to be enormously successful among young, undisciplined students who lack the discernment or the inclination necessary to tell history from fantasy (as several of the reviews above will attest.) Ginzburg, although an accomplished researcher and a fine writer, has written a very murky and extremely biased interpretation of Domenico Scandella's life. Ginzburg is far too facile and quick to cite his own unsubstantiated assertions as ""proof"" of his conclusions, and his slipshod thinking mars what might otherwise have been a fine and valuable book."
3,Dramatization takes a priority,"It strings you along, dangling its evidence and purpose within your sense of smell but outside your other senses, for dramatic effect. It made for a mildly entertaining read, but as far as an historical work is concerned, it's more frustrating than brilliant."
3,interesting case in realistic recreating of cultural history,"This book presents an interesting case in realistic recreating of history; when the well-documented record of the 16th century Inquisition Trial are brought into scrutiny based on the cultural context of the times. The most fascinating things for me were descriptions of the bookshelf of the 16th century peasant; with so few book which can influence oneself (and for most people it was just one book - a Bible). Unfortunately, the book tends to become more repeatable, looses focus and ultimately my interest. One can sense hesitation of the author - am I really writing a history or fiction; it is not thorough and detailed enough to be history, and narrative development is not exciting enough for it to become very good literature."
3,Almost Perfect,"Pretty good book. The plot was kind of out there, but the characters were well-defined. Ms. Metzger's book(s) feature characters that do a lot of (wordy) introspection. Kind of slows down the flow of the book, but still and all, Ms. Metzger can write and I'll keep on reading her as long as she does."
4,Despite a few flaws...,"...such as the too easy ending for the missing sister, not enough urgency regarding said sister, and a mildly written and easy to figure out but creepy murder mystery...Metzger creates a delightful hero in Stony, a strong, independent heroine, and some truly wonderful and unique secondary characters. Moreover, her wit just sparkles, causing me to laugh out loud more often than I could possibly keep up with.While I have found Metzger's short stories to be hit or miss, this book made me a believer, and I'll try another of her full-length works soon. This one was delightful!"
5,book,babara metzger rocks and so does the company i bought the book from.tey delivered in a very timely manner and the book was in great condition
4,A great book,"This was a great book. I thought it was funny and exciting. The reason that it was funny was because they thought a man was a monster, but it was only Matt. It was funny becuase Matt was a kid and the three other guys were adults. Now if you want to find out the other problem you can read the story to find out. You can find this book in a local library or the media center. It was exciting because I always get fascintatecdd in the mysteries. So read the book."
3,This May Hurt (A Little),"Though their sound is similar on most tracks, I really am digging this album. I admit, I'm kind of a sucker for the psych sounds of Elephant 8, but this group has a nice mid to up tempo rocking sound that never dives to deep into true psychedelia or the bizarre. Steady, consistently good. Great mixed with other clean guitar centered rock or E8 friends."
3,Good but incomplete,"I rented the VHS for this from my local library. I was excited to watch a movie about Booker T. Washington and seeing that is was from Featured Films for Familys, I was sure it would be clean. I was disappointed in the length of the film as it turned out to be about an hour long and only covered a year of Booker's boyhood right after the end of the Civil War. The acting was pretty good though but I wished it was longer."
4,Loving tribute by author Steel,"Danielle Steel is known for her works of fiction, but in this one (the first Steel book I have admittedly read) she shares a great deal of personal history. Her son suffers from bipolar disorder and causes much heartache in her life. Yet she loves him unconditionally.A terrific love letter from a mother to her son..."
5,A searing and moving account,"This is not just one mother's struggle to help and understand her bipolar child, it is a commentary on the state of help for mentally ill adolescents. The one mother, of course, being the famous and wealthy Danielle Steel who had resources beyond most parents wildest dreams. Yet she encountered numerous educators, psychologists and psychiatrists who were incompetent and disastrous. But this book is also about unconditional love, being resourceful and never giving up. As someone who has worked in both mental health and education, I am so sad that when kids don't fall into the cookie-cutter mold (although Nick was far from that), there is such a hodge-podge of often inadequate help for them. I highly recommend this book and think Danielle Steel has really given readers a wonderful gift in sharing her story."
3,touching suicide story,"This well-written story shares the experiences of one family with a Bipolar young man who ultimately commits suicide. Although interesting, most parents cannot afford full-time bodyguards for their child,nor some of the other interventions that the wealthy and famous author could--even though they didn't work. While this is a touching story, it can be somewhat depressing for parents struggling to find ways to prevent their child from becoming suicidal. Other resources can provide more practical advice that helps parents successfully handle the daily challenges of parenting a bipolar child.--Sheryl Gurrentz, author""If Your Child is Bipolar: A Parent-to-Parent Guide to Living With and Love a Bipolar Child"""
5,This sensitive subjuct book really hit home,"Danielle Steele really outdid herself in this emotional/sensitive book about her son. I could not put this one down...His Bright Light hit me so hard, it hurt!!!"
2,Sad story,"Very sad story, but a hard book to finish. I love Danielle Steel, but unfortunately did not love this book. However, reading this book did make me really feel for her and her family."
1,His Bright Light,Very well written book. Love Danielle Steele. It had to be a challange for her to write this story of her son and all his challanges
1,I found this book to be a major disappointment.,"I have enjoyed Ms. Steele's books in the past, and I looked forward to this ""real life"" one. Boy, did I feel cheated! I felt ""His Bright Light,"" , with its hyperbole and self-serving redundant comments about how much SHE loved her ""genius"" son, how SHE was the only one to understand him, etc. etc., just too much to stomach. It reminded me of the line from Hamlet: ""The lady doth protest too much, methinks."" Sadly, after reading this book, which I had to force myself to finish, methinks I respect this author a whole lot less."
4,Alot of love written on the pages,Very interesting insight on manic depressive behavior. Very educational and extremely touching. A real tear jerker with alot of love written on the pages.
2,It never should have been published.,"And it wouldn't have been if Steel hadn't of been famous. I haven't read anything else by Steel, but it has to be better than this. I understand that this is a very personal book for her, and was probably very painful to write, but that is no excuse for repeating the same things over and over and over again, and really giving no insight into anything (i.e. just plain bad writing.) I wouldn't recommend reading this book unless you knew Nick personaly, and certinly not if you expect to get any kind of ""help"" from it."
3,THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL FAR FROM THE TREE,"While this wacky gem has it's moments, Steele often resorts to sophmoric, sitcom-like stunts to emphasize the drama. Like Nick Traina, the punk-rock badboy of the novel, Danielle Steele tries to have her cake and eat it too. You go girl!"
5,A disturbing page-turner,"Danielle Steel proves once again SHE CAN WRITE -words pour from her pen. BUYTHIS BOOK you won't be able tp put it down. Some disturbing things about this book, however: if the author was respectful of Nick's privacy during his life, and therefore didn't read his diaries, how come she quotes them extensively for the entire world to read in this book? And how, in the name of common sense, could she, as a mother well aware of her son's mental illness (and unmentioned heroin addiction) encourage him to become a rock ""megastar"" when even mentally well people hardly succeed in this field?"
5,MY REVIEW,This book was very good and I read it because I wanted to find out about manic depression. I found it very useful and it made me realise how hard it must be to live with someone who suffers from it. It was about Danielle Steels son who was born with manic depression but they could not diagnose it until he was in his late teens. it was very touching.
5,Awesome,I didn't read this book because of the author as most did. I read it to try to get a better understanding and learn more about someones life from a band that i like. The story was awesome. It made me understand more about this person and the struggle he went through and that his family went through. It was touching and made me think. I suggest that you read this and form your own opion don't read it to find out about manic depression read it if you are curious as to the struggle of a young mans life dealing with manic depression.
4,Manic-depression is a cold hell,"""His Bright Light: The Story of Nick Traina"", is a frightingly real observation of someybody you love so dearly battling with manic-depression. Ms. Steel gave everything to help her son get over this most dreaded disease. I recommend this book to anybody who may think they know of somebody suffering from any form of depression."
4,Well written and precise view into the life of depression,Found this to be an engaging and informing story of a family's struggle with living with a person suffering from depression... one not unlike my own...
2,I can't say,"The story itself is okay talking about Nick's illness and how the family dealt with it. The whispersync part keeps shuting off every few pages, then I lose my place, since I was listening to the story. So I've became very annoyed and just shut it off until I get time to talk to an Technican."
3,A Real Story,"This was an inside look into Dainelle Steele's life as a mother of a dear child with very special needs. It did stick with me as I usually read her books for an easy and light fiction read. It made me sad for her even though she reflected a lot on the happy times, this must have been so hard for the entire family."
3,"Touching, But Hard to Get Through!!","When I saw that this book was written as a tribute to the author's son, I was interested in reading it. As I read the book, I saw Ms Steels love for her son and it tore at my heart. I felt that the author longed for her son to be ""normal"", but of course, from a young age he was not! And his lifestyle and homelife by any means were not normal! Looking through Nick's eyes, he must have longed for a mother who was not jet-setting around the world and in and out of his life! I thought Nick had a lot of love to give, but also liked the attention he received from the wild things he did. At his death, my heart hurt for his mother. It made me think a lot about ""could I handle a situation like this"" if it happened to me? The book was written as a gift of love for a son. I have to be honest here and say that while the book was fairly interesting to me, it was too long and repetitious and I was ready for it to end."
1,Very misleading,"I'm bipolar, and was given this book. It was written with the best of intent, but it made me very angry to read it. First, she spends so much time talking about Nick's depression as a disease, a genetic problem, a medical condition, but doesn't even think that a big part of his condition was his upbringing. You learn everything from your parents, and when mom is jet-setting Europe, writing books, and popping out more kids, you'll grow up with issues. The only time Nick got attention was when he went off of his medicine or did something else extreme. The entire book builds Nick into some kind of god but ignores that his trouble is more than a bad gene or something. I'm glad my mother didn't read this book when I was 14 and lock me into some kind of concentration camp reeducation resort based on this flawed information about manic-depression."
2,Not my favourite Danielle Steel!,Story seemed to lose momentum in parts and was a little bit long winded.Definately not a favourite for me!
4,What a Llady,This book makes you think what an incredible lady this writer is and what a sad life her son had in many ways... worth a read
5,"SAD, TERRIFYING, but AN EXTREMELY AWESOME BOOK!!","I'm not much of a reader and this is the first Danielle Steel book i have read--and the very best book i have ever read!! His Bright Light was well written and in great detail. I enjoyed reading this book even if-most of the time i cried. I can't even begin to say how deeply this book touched me and made me see things differently. I am glad i read it and will never forget about what Nick Traina went through mentally and spiritually. I loved this book so much. Thank you Danielle Steel for being strong enough and writing such an awesome book!!! Anyone, who has the chance should read His Bright Light."
4,It gave me renewed compassion for the ill person in my life.,Danille Steeles motive (to help others) in writing this book was acheived when I read it. It has been so helpful in continuing a struggle with my own family member. I believe any remark about DS not loving her son enough to save him is ridiculous unless you can show me you saved a manic depressed person with love.
3,It is an OK book.,"This is the first book I have ever read from Danielle Steel. Even though it is a different book to what she normally would write - I can tell her style of writing is not my thing. She writes like EVERYTHING is perfect in her life, but this small think Nick has. I think she mentioned like 50 times how gorgeous her son was - we get it. I was hoping she would be more honest. I have read over 40 books on bipolar and this one falls at the bottom. I am giving it a 3 as it did hold my interest enough to finish it."
2,Heartfelt but mawkish and repetitive,"While one can only possibly feel sympathy for the pain Nick's mother feels, her writing style is sentimental and flowery in the extreme. The descriptions of a manic depressive personality and suggestions for dealing with one are excellent, and there is no doubt that she did all she could for her son whom she loved dearly - however having established that, it was tedious to read over, and over, and over again her expressions of motherly love, her gratitude repeatedly to the same people and the gushing in general. It is also difficult to understand from her telling why she was unable to cope with her own son while another mother with less space, less money and younger children was able to take him in for the last few years. The book was worthwhile in some ways but could have told the same story with as much information and feeling in less than half the number of pages."
5,His Bright Light,"This book is a true story written by Danielle Steel portraying the life of her son Nick Traina who was diagnosed with manic depression and committed suicide at the age of 19 yrs. Danielle Steel, a picture of beauty and strength, writes very candidly about the struggles she endured in raising him amidst a large family and a busy schedule. The book tends to be somewhat graphic, a little morbid, but might be very helpful for parents who struggle with difficult children or those suffering from mental illness in their lives. I appreciate Danielle Steel as an author even more after reading this book because of her willingness to share her true feelings and pain."
2,not good,Very hard to get into its a book you can put down and pick it up days later and still caring on with it
3,His Bright Light,"I really enjoy her writing, but found this book very hard and depressing to read. Left me feeling quite disturbed."
4,His Bright Light,"This book is a story of success and a young man who met so many challenges in his young life. I cannot relate to Nick traina, he was an only child and that alone has to have an influence on his bringing up, he did many things in his life I also cannot relate to but did enjoy this book."
3,His Bright Light: The Story of Nick Traina,"A difficult subject and I'm actually having a had time getting thru it. However, my reading time is when my grandsons are playing with my Kindle."
3,His Bright Light:,"I had a son die last year from mental illness and he couldn't get any help without insurance. The book was okay but I wasn't crazy about it. I can definitely relate to all the ups and downs his mom went through. I guess I expected something else than what I read. I relate to how talented he was, with his mental hlth issues. My son was also very talented in music."
2,Not Worth Reading,"This book made me dislike Nick Traina, and Danielle Steel. I read it and wondered who she was trying to convince that Nick was talented, charming, and just plain wonderful. It also made me wonder who she was trying to convince that she did all she could for her talented, charming, just plain wonderful son. It's clear that Steel has turned her son into a god, that's not unusual to do with a dead loved one. However, I don't want to be told she wrote this book to help other people. Danielle Steel seems to be self-absorbed. I feel horrible for her children that are still alive. The lack of love and attention they seemed to recieve because of Nick is what is heartbreaking about this story."
4,Sharing in his light,"This book was very enlightening. I'm not a regular reader of Danielle Steel, however I've always admired her writing. This book though caught my attention because of the subject matter. I was grateful to Ms. Steel for opening up such a personal aspect of her life to the public. I hope writing it helped in her healing as well. This book really shows from a young age (infant) just how strong a mother's intuition is and some, what I believe from my experience as well, what can truly be some tell-tale signs of mental illness. I would definitely recommend this book, especially for anyone who suffers from bi-polar disorder, or knows someone with the same."
4,His Bright Light - A Child With Mental Illness,"The notoriously private Danielle Steel opens up her entire life to readers in this emotional and moving true story about her son Nick, who struggled his entire life with mental illness. I highly recommend this book for any mother who has a child with a mental illness."
3,"Heart-ache, confusion and anxiety of mental illness","Ms. Steele's description of her son's battle with mental illness provides much-needed information to others struggling with this as well as to the general public. However, the message could have been heard more clearly had Ms. Steele written with more coherence and less repetition. The writing degenerates at times into more of a personal journal entry than a biography. Had she given any attention to the tremendous impact this illness had on the other children, it would have been more of a public service and less of a personal grief statement. All those criticisms aside, she does do a fine job of relaying the pain, fear and upheaval which mental illness brings to the individual and his/her family."
3,good but shameful,"I am only thirteen years old, but I believe that it is wrong to open up your son's private life to the whole world. People of diversity will read this book, but not all will take it the way that the author is trying to display. It is a book that tells the story of a very accomplished young man but had too many problems to deal with in his life. By making his life story public shows that the author has no respect for his private life. This book is well written, but if I were the mother, I would not have written it in the first place."
1,a mother capitalizing on a tragedy,"I have not read this book because I refuse to support D.S.'s making money of the tragic death of Nick. Being just an acquantaince of his, I am still knowledgeable enough to know that Danielle Steel is known to not be there for any of her children, especially Nick. While Nick was struggling though his teen years, she was solving the problem by shipping him off to expensive schools/rehabs... not that she cares since she made the money back by publishing this book. I deeply sympathize with Nick's family and friends for it was truly a great loss for everyone... I just wish that Danielle Steel knew when it was appropriate to respect her son's privacy. Nick's best friend and son of Boz Scaggs, Oscar, recently died of a heroin O.D. Boz and Carmella Scaggs are speaking out about the dangers of herion and our youth that abuse it... I wish Danielle Steel could have used her power to speak out about that in her community instead of ignoring that issue completely."
1,extremely melodramatic and repetitious,"While it is very hard to accept the death of a loved one, you should never lose touch with the importance of the rest of your family. She seemed to totally ignore her other children. Every doctor was wrong, every school was wrong, everyone else wrong but him. Had she not sainted him from the beginning perhaps she would've seen it coming. The book was a complete bore and I found myself tortured to reach the end. Every chapter was the same. I couldn't wait for him to die and get it over with. I was mad I had wasted the time to read it. I can't hardly believe it got good reviews from anyone who has ever dealt with a personal death or sickness. The book could've been two chapters and then finished, instead of the same story repeated endlessly throughout."
2,NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING,"The book told a lot about Nick but not what I wanted hear, and after reading it I now think of Miss Princess Danielle Stell as selfish and very in love with herself. Yes in the Book she explains over and over again how much she loves Nick, but I do not beleive she means it. She sent him away all the time because he did not fit into her perfect life, and if you ask me I think she's the one that made him ill in the first place."
3,Danielle Steele is a guilt ridden neurotic.,"Danielle refused to keep her kid off drugs, which should have been her prioroty. but she let him get out of control, It does prove the point that manic depression is serious"
3,Heavy duty reel,"This is a sturdy, heavy duty hose reel thathas proved to be a bit cumbersome for my wifeto operate when she waters our small garden.The reel is probably more suitable for largerlawns and watering needs. For our modest needs,I would have been better off with anotherAmes 'bench' reel, which has worked well for usin the past.Also, the water assembly inside the reel startedleaking the first time I used the reel, so I hadto disassemble the reel to get at the hard-to-accessassembly and fix the leak.Again, this is a strongreel, made of sturdy plastic and is strong enough tosit on or store bags of mulch, etc. on the top."
2,Needed to fix it right out of the box,"The Auto Track Guide was separated into two pieces right out of the box. I had to shave factory plastic filaments away from the connector tabs to get it to secure itself. Also, I had to bend the connector tabs out a bit to get them to lock. I pinched my fingers bloody doing it. Then I turned on the hose and found that the hose leading from the spicket was leaking at the Reel connection. I tried to tighten the hose clamp but it was stripped. After going to the hardware store and buying a new clamp the Reel works fine; but I don't like buying something brand new and having to fix it upon arrival. The Reel has a smooth operation, that's why I'm not giving it my worst rating."
1,Junk,This is a worthless piece of junk. After an hour of trying to connect my hoze to the outlet on the spool I gave up. The outlet is a cheap piece of molded plastic. It is probably out of the thread specification dimension.
2,improvement in need!,"I have to agree w/ other reviews on this textbook even though I have a lot of respects for Prof. Rao. I have used for two semesters and it has not been a pleasant read on this exciting topic! A lot typos and errors, and language is not very good, e.g. very long sentences and sometimes vague! Hope the next edition is a lot of better!"
2,Here's hoping your lecture is good.,"This book has its up and downs (quite a bit more of the latter), but to put it bluntly, this book expects quite a bit too much from the reader. It's laid out strangely, and the examples are far too sparse for the number of concepts thrown at the reader. There are many times when more details over sections would've been extremely helpful. If you've got a good lecture to go along side this book, you might learn something. If your lecturer is terrible, you will gain nothing from this book.Also, keep an eye out for some of the more vital mistakes. Particularly fun are the formula definitions that are flat out wrong. Thank goodness there's a new edition every few years to keep Rao's coffers full!"
3,Reflection coefficient is explained well~,I find it quite helpful to understand the Reflection coefficient concept and transmission line surges with this book. I havent read through the whole book yet; but i think this is one of the best intro. EM books which illustrates the reflections coefficient and voltage transmission coefficient systematically.
5,If You're Not The One,"I recommend this song to anyone who loves music! If You're NotThe One, is an absolutely beautiful song. It has alot of meaning, and lets just say, Daniel Bedingfield is HOT and his voice is gorgeous!"
4,A hell of a ride!!!!!,"This game has no real story depth, or gameplay depth, but it is a jam packed action shooter. It really feels like you are in a Hong Kong shooter with guns blazing everywhere. Want proof?? If you run out of ammo in a shoot-out then just walk around a bit and you are sure to pick up ammo from all the fallen enimies. You really see John Woo's presence in the game with the gun battles. Almost everything can be shot up and destroyed wich just causes mass debris to go flying. It was great to see Chow Yun Fat reprise his role as Inspector Tequila.This game truly personifies a rollercoaster of a game. Nothing intellectually great, but A LOT OF FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Stranglehold gets repetitive but..,Its still a fun game in spurts. If you play this game for 30 minutes each session then you will enjoy the the game. You cannot play this game for long periods because it will just get boring & feel extremely repetitive.Its simiar to Max Payne with the gunplay but adds in style as key feature. Not a bad game at all but you MUST not spend to much time playing
2,The Woo factor,"This game is John Woo in every way, style and no substance. Great shooting mechanics but after the Woo factor wears off in the beginning of the game, it gets VERY VERY repetitive. Great game for Achievement/Trophy farming, you won't hang your self or kick your puppy after hours of playing it, but you won't play it again after you get your Acheivements/Trophys. Like a Psychotic girl/boyfriend get what you can out of this game and never play it again."
3,interesting,i found this game in a bargain bin for 25 bucks an decided to pick it up i was actually really impressed the first hour or so playing it and really enjoyed it but after awhile there was just so much stuff goin on onscreen that i started to get a headache lol and i found the never having to reload kinda cheesy along with the endless amount of enemies flooding out of random doors a lil repetative but all in all i really enjoyed the action movie style stunts and destructable environments really fun theres just so much on screen commotion
2,update to previous review,"This is the worst part of this game.Get to know the meaning of claustrophobic. This game will take you there. Most of the time throughout the game there are either people or things right next to you and you can not see them all so you end up trying to go the wrong direction right into them. Also once you jump up on a highlighted item, which is difficult because it won't always highlight very easy, it is difficult to get off. The camera view distance keeps changing when something is close behind, and since as stated there are constantly things near you, it is maddening on ones equilibrium. You just spend your time wishing for more areas out in the open. It seems as though the programmer just wanted to drive you crazy insted of make a fun game."
1,Stranglehold chokes.,"Stranglehold is the single worst multiplayer game ever created. These guys took a lunch break and decided to add some net-code. You have a game where you can shoot someone point-blank half a dozen times and still get nothing on them unless you have run around some box of a level and picked up a bunch of paper cranes to pull off some real trite power moves. Bullet time? Again?!?Single-play in Stranglehold has the occasional fun part but nothing at all original about it. The level designs range from boxes to bigger boxes. The programmers seem to think intriguing level design is secondary to throwing half the Chinese army at you at any given time. The destructive environments will keep you interested for about five seconds.Rent this game if you want, just don't buy it and feel like you wasted your precious money like I did."
2,Lousy 3rd person shooter,"I like 3rd person shooters but this game is terrible... Bad graphics, horrible playability... DO NOT BUY. Rent if you want to try it... you will get tired of it soon..."
2,Way over rated,"The graphics the game has are decent but extremely repetive. You can expect to see the same objects over and over. The games objectives are thrown together and bland. Go blow up ten meth labs. Rinse and repeat. The Tequila time gets very annoying. Do to the fact that it activates every time you walk by a table or any other ""interactive environment."" The weapons are generic and repetitive. The game is bland and forgettable. A rent only."
2,Short but sweet,This game took me about 4 hours to beat. I loved the action in the game but it was repetative. I as kind of bored and kind of excited. I dont think you should buy it though it is really short for a lot of money you should get viva pinata instead.
1,Mr. Big back to Budokan,"Great DVD. Mr. Big is a great group.. Love it that there is so much music on these 2 DVD's. If you're a Mr. Big fan, you'll want this."
2,Back to Budokan,Great guitar work / great drummer / vocals don't do it for me. I will keep in my record collection & recommend this to all budding guitarists to have a look at the Gilbert's techniques & speed & musical guitar-work.
3,Does NOT come with CD,"My kids (ages 1 and 4) love this book, and after borrowing it (with CD) from the library and renewing it several times I decided to purchase it. I knew there was an old review that stated their purchased didn't come with the CD, but I took a chance anyway. This version (paperback) does NOT include the CD. Amazon should update the description."
4,Good for a 3 year old,"My three year old loves this show, but we enjoyed ""Spring for Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Meet Strawberry Shortcake"" a little bit more. If your child is a fan, you should probably buy it for their collection, but I would try the other ones I mentioned first."
4,Great For Any Strawberry Shortcake Lover,We love Strawberry Shortcake in this house and this movie doesn't fall short of our expectations. Strawberry and friends go around the world to meet new people from other countries. Very cute.
5,Great,"The Frank Capra-esque stylings of the camera work, put together with the visionary production, which I can only assume was the work of the great George Lucas, makes this, dare I say, the greatest piece of film of our generation. With the subtle nuisances, reminiscent of the early era of film, the cinematography alone creates a genius work. Add to that, the acting of the greatest actors in the business today, this movie goes from genius, to masterpiece... Oh wait, nevermind... IT'S STRAWBERRY-FU##ING-SHORTCAKE. It keeps my 4 year old from making me go out in the hot Arkansas summer for an hour."
4,My 19 month old loved it,"Kept the attention of my 19 month old and me!Messages about friendship, working together, being honest, being aware of differences but to not let that stop you from being a friend. Cute DVD, will probably buy more SS DVDs"
3,"Very cute, but not educational.","Perhaps my expectations were unreasonable, but I bought this to introduce my daughter to some other cultures in preparation for a trip around the world, and was very disappointed. It is extremely ""cute,"" and the characters are very ""hip,"" there is some interesting content on dealing with conflict in groups of friends, and my daughter did sit enraptured through the whole thing. All in all, if you're looking for pure entertainment, it's a fun piece, but there's little educational value."
1,Doesn't work !,"This is totally junk product. It didn't work for me, infact the adapter just melted ! Luckily no major harm done.Shame on digipower that they consistently release junk products. Previously they had useless AA NiMH batteries which didn't hold charge for even half an hr.Consider twice before you buy anything from this [] company. Its just not worth your time or money."
4,Plug it in,Good AC adapter for use with Fuji Camera's. Great if your camera also functions as a web cam. Cheaper than Fuji branded item.
5,worth the price,"These things are much better than the Craftsman pliers you get for $11. Are they worth close to triple the price? I guess it depends on how often you need to use them. For me it was worth it. Both the handles and the tips are well made and do not flex much. I use them quite often, and haven't had a ring slip off the ends once.The extra tips, of course, are already lost in the bottom of my tool box. It would have been nice to have a built in storage container, but I guess that would be excessive for just a pair of pliers."
5,Great!!!,This is gospel music put to the shag beat at its best. Heaven Bound is uplifting as well as stimulating. Love the whole cd-hope it inspires you as it has me
2,Thoroughly Factual and Incredibly Dry,"In a clearly acedemic work the authors imparts a wealth of information about business of bullfighting in the 18th and 19th century. The different factions within the business of bullfighting, matadors, their assistants, promotors, bull breeders, the press, and the crowds are all examined in fine detail. Unfortunately, this interesting information is delivered as simply one fact after another with little consideration for creating an engaging narrative. By the end of the book you'll know a great deal about the history of the business of bullfighting but it'll be up to you to put the facts together the get more complete picture."
4,Impartiality at Last!,"Adrian Shubert presents a historical view of the bullfights that is neither pro or con, which is very rare today. The origins, although unclear to everyone, are presented in an unbiased form. Having attended over fifty bullfights in my 34 years of life, I found it very refreshing to learn the importance of the bullfight, not only in the romantic and cultural sense, but from historical and buisiness facts. This was definately worth the money."
5,AWESOMEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS SOOOOO COOOLLLLLLLL!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I LOVE ITTTTTTT!!!!!! YEAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! IM SOOOOOO HAPPYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Extreme Drumming to the MAX!,"WOW! If your looking for inspiration at any level then this is the DVD for you! I've never seen ANY drummer play like MARCO before! You won't believe the drum sound (5.1 Surround Sound) and EVERY camera shot is upclose to the point where I felt I was right in the room with him. Marco breaks down patterns to his songs and his unique hand and foot interdependence so that anyone can follow and apply these techniques immediately to the drumset. With over 4 hrs. of footage along with mp3 downloads and a 15 page PDF booklet with exercises and play-along drumcharts, this is one I'm going to watch and learn from for a very long time. My drumming improved immediately.I highly recommend EXTREME DRUMMING and at $$$, ya'can't beat it! GOTTA GET IT!!! WOW!!!"
5,I cant explain how much I love this series!,"If you are feeling sad and depressed, Maison Ikkoku will cheer you up. If you are in the mood for a laugh, it will have you rolling on the floor. If you're in a romantic mood, it will bring tears of joy to your eyes. And if your a broke college student like me, it might just give you some ideas for living cheaply! In other words there is something for everything in this touching and immensely funny series which just gets better with age. The story is, in some respects, very Japanese, but in a larger sense it is universal--this could happen to you, or me, or anyone. The chracters are great, the story is great, the series is just great! Go buy it now! ^_^"
1,Not a great cookbook....,"I was expecting something a little more oiginal, I feel the cookbook is outdated and not up to what the title states."
3,artistic,I THOUGHT THAT MADONNA COULD OF DONE BETTER ON THIS VIDEO. SHE COULD OF DONE MORE MOVEMENTS AND SHOULD OF PUT IN MORE STYLE INTO THE VIDEO
2,Madonna - The Immaculate DECEPTION,"I love Madonna!!!!! I purchased the original VHS version back when it first came out -- And now the DVD version, and the reproduction quality is REALLY POOR! The videos are blurry -- its as if they lost the original (or was not able to obtain it) and used a copy to make the DVD. For example, In the video ""Pappa Don't Preach"", in some of the ""low light"" parts, you cant even make out their faces - total silhouette... not so on the VHS version.But there are two BIG SURPRISES on the DVD that was edited out on the VHS version --- Madonna had (2) wardrobe malfunctions in her dance sequences in the ""Pappa Don't Preach"" video, - two total breast shots with full nipple exposure on both!!! Sorry Miss Jackson...Looks like Madonna did it first again!Overall, most of the videos on the DVD were not as crisp and clear as the original VHS version."
3,A Must Have but WHERE'S the Surround Sound?,I was sort of disappointed to see that only stereo was included on the DVD. The albums are recorded in surround so I don't understand why this package (and the newer video collection) are only in stereo. Try out the Gloria Estefan DVDs for hi-fi sound quality! Perhaps the fact that Gloria is on SONY meant that they realized sound quality on a DVD is as important as on a CD.
5,to summ it up in one word AWSOME,if you love madonna you'll lov her collection cause its pure or shall i say immaculate!!!
5,Fascinatingly easy,"After my initial ""how the heck does this thing work"" ignorance, I've decided that this is a great product. Not to knock amazon, but I purchased mine at Walgreens on sale for $24. The instructions are very easy to follow. It does however take at least 5 minutes for your saliva to dry on the ""optical piece"". And the important thing to remember is that it IS a microscope so put it directly in front of your eye like a microscope. And of course adjust the focus up and down until you can see something like the pictures in the instructions guide. And I hate how they call the so-called ovulation results ""ferning"" I think it should be called ""crystallization"" or ""crystal structures"" but that could just be me. Also I really like the lipstick case with mirror included."
2,it was fun while it lasted,It worked for about two months then the light died. It's a shame because my husband and I were having fun with it
2,"Love the idea, but it broke really quick!","This is super easy to use, just be sure to be diligent and use it every morning before you get up to brush your teeth or drink anything.[Normal days are just scattered ""specs"" while ovulation days look like ferns.. the specs connect... something to do with the salt levels I think. The couple of days right before are indistinct fern-ish shapes, but not so separated as the dots.]Mine broke after a couple of months, but not so bad that it was unusable for almost 6 months. (the back wouldn't stay in place, so the wires for the light got all twisted, inconsistently shorting out, and finally disconnected.)I didn't return or replace it when it finally gave out completely since I didn't need it anymore."
1,did not live up to my expectations,I found this product to be almost useless as the results turned out to be very confusing. It was difficult to tell when the fern like patterns were forming and therefore it was impossible to determine when the ovulation was supposed to start. It was a waste of my money!
2,Not Reliable,"I read the reviews and decided to test this out. When I use it first thing in the morning it shows no ferning (even after a half hour or more), but at night when I come home from work and check it again, there is ferning. Seems like there is some kind of ferning every day. It may just be me, but I don't think that this is a reliable product."
5,clear and organized and practical,"The book is well organized and offers practical information for someone trying to begin or enhance practice. I did not experience any of this text as esoteric. The exercise instruction is very clear. In the exercise section, the pictures are simple and amazingly instructive. After reading this book, I felt confident I had learned a valuable practice. Put another way, I was not confused, overwhelmed, or left wondering. This book is well worth its cost, indeed worth more."
5,No need to worry about receiving a broken press!,"After having read some of the other reviews, I was hesitant to even purchase this item because I was afraid it would arrive broken. Well it arrived in perfect shape!"
4,Nice but small,"Being the only coffee drinker at home, I thought a 4-cup press would be fine for one but it is a bit small. I find that almost 1/2 full I get one cup out.....maybe I just have really huge cups?!"
4,Great Coffee!!,"This makes an excellent cup of Joe! It's a perfect size for one person. Very easy and quick to use. In a few of the past reviews, it mentioned that the glass was too thin... it seems fine to me but there is a warning not to add boiling water so as long as your water isn't too hot, I don't really forsee it being a problem. I love mine and I'll never give it up!"
4,My First French Press,"Turned out to be a pretty well made little jewel. Easy to break down and clean. This is the only one I have ever owned, but I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for one."
3,5 oz. cups,"Boden MUST be talking about 5 oz cups when they say this is a 4 cups press. It barely fills my 20 oz mug and then it's kinda over flowing. I love this french press, it makes great coffee, I just wish I had more information to have bought a 6 cup press instead."
2,They measure cups differently than I do,"This is a probably fine product - for a 2 cup coffee press (I ordered the 4 cup). I can't think of any decent reason other than advertising to misrepresent the size of this item. True - it may make 4 - 4 oz cups of coffee, but at that point you are no longer using any sort of standard meaning for the word cup, and you might as well assign it any number of cups which suits your fancy. I'll be exchanging my 17 cup press for one of a more suitable size."
1,the 4-Cup Coffee Press is only a 2 Cup,"Bodum is ripping folks off, i.e. the 3-Cup is only a 1-Cup the 4-Cup is only a 2-Cup and the 8-Cup is only a 4-Cup, in my book that's a rip off!! In the USA if you say ""hey it's a 4-Cup Coffee Press"" the thing had better be able to hold 4-Cups of hot water not, i.e. 32Oz not 16 1/2Oz A complaint was fild with the Federal Trade Commission, i.e. the Box says 4-Cup Coffee Maker right on it in 3 places.. All over Amazon's sales page.. Last time I checked it was against federal law to say ""4 Cup Coffee Maker"" if it only holds 2 Cups.."
5,Coffee press review,"I broke my Daughters' press, so I sent for the Bodum Chambord 4-cup Coffee Press. It was delivered very quickly, and the price was reasonable. My Daughter was happy with it. Thank you"
5,Bodum Chambord 4 cup Coffee Press,"After tasting coffee from a press I had to have one. I researched several coffee presses and talked to a few people with a press and chose the Bodum Chambord 4 cup. Not too many things in life impress me but this does. This press will bring flavors out in mediocre coffee. When you buy one experiment with different coffees and you'll be surprised. I actually get up and make me some coffee and take 20 minutes every morning just to enjoy it and savor the taste, something I have never done before. The best part of waking up is my coffee!Bodum Chambord 4-Cup Coffee Press"
4,Flavorful coffee,I bought the pot as a gift for my daughter. She loved it and feels the coffee does not have a harsh taste as found with other pots that use a filter. The only complaint is it is too small and she can't make enough.
4,Works very well!,"This is the first french press I have ever owned and also the first time I had coffee made this way. It's very good, and easy to make. I think the most important thing is a coarse grind. When I made a cup, there was coffee silt at the bottom of the cup. The screen is a good size but coffee dust can get past the side. Easy to clean and small so it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. I would recommend!"
5,top quality press,"This is the first time I've used a French press coffee maker. It is made of top quality materials and works great. I wanted to move away from the drip coffee maker because of the combination of hot water with plastic which may cause leaching of chemicals. The French press is a bit more time consuming, but the flavor makes it worth it. Cleaning the grounds out is a bit more of a pain then just dumping the filter with the grounds from the coffee maker.If you are wanting a French press, this is definitely the one to get!I do have to say that the first one I ordered arrived and the glass part was broken. I sent it back it it was replaced immediately, no charge. The second time it was packaged much better."
1,Corning ware,"This item makes great coffee - only one major problem - the glass container has no quality @ all! Kept having to get new glass replacements. Finally went with frieling stainless steel press - coffee is just as good, without the problem of cheap glass. So if you buy this product - good luck. When you get tired of replacing cheap glass; you'll switch also. This company needs to switch there glass container to something on the order of Corning ware (heat treated glass), that likes hot and cold changes without cracking. Also, beware, these containers aren't what they say - 2 cup is not 2, and 4 cup is ont 4, etc. - at least not by U.S. standards."
2,Try a less expensive brand,"The glass container is not held well by the frame and the plunger does not fit together well. Very poor manufacturing quality and poor design. I have other, less expensive models from other manufacturers that are much higher quality."
5,bodum 4 cup french press,Perfect size for a large mug of coffee. Must fill the container with boiling water otherwise coffee will be lukewarm. Easy to clean as it is dishwasher safe.Bodum Chambord 4-Cup Coffee Press
5,great coffee!,"I bought one of these small bodum presses, and unfortunately it arrived with a crack in it. I was sent a replacement immediately, and had a great cup of coffee this morning. I plan to get the larger one for use when I have company or family over."
5,Great Coffee,"The coffee press takes coffee to a different level of enjoyment. It is fun to ""work"" for your coffee using a manual devise. The coffee has some sediment in it but it settles to the bottom of the cup. If you drink black coffee you will marvel at the extraordinary flavor. The Bodum Coffee Press is of very high quality, beautifully designed and makes wonderful coffee. The only drawback is dealing with the grounds but it is really no trouble."
1,a great brew..broke already,"Previously gave it a good review however; now after two months of not daily use,it's broke( the glass spout (lip))NO MORE ASIAN PRODUCTS for me."
3,Bodum 4-cup,This is fine. It's just hard to get top off. Wish top wouldn't break up so easily. I have to order several a year.
4,Much examples,"This is a good book for a senior undergraduate probability course, it has many examples which provides good understanding. But some results I think it would be too difficult for a 3rd year course to have their students to absorb the material. Again, it is pretty pricy too."
1,terrible,"this book is not an easy read. it goes from proposition to proposition. although there are examples after the propositions, the reading is incredibly laborious. I suggest you stay away from this book"
4,Very Good book but not the best in this topic,"My proffesor in Industrial Statiscs class liked it for some themes, but not for all. So sometimes it's better to use other sources. So that's why we used another book for some topics."
4,good balance of rigour and problems,"Ross presents a good treatment of probability theory. Enough rigour to be suitable for most students. Along with a very extensive problem set for each chapter. Instructors looking for a good text to accompany a course might consider this book. The exercises are varied enough to cover most of the aspects of each chapter. Answers are given to some exercises. But notably not all.All the common, important distributions are explained, along with their usages. Poisson, geometric, exponential. Even the somewhat obscure hypergeometric. Plus, there is an extensive discussion of Markov chains, which find many applications.A solid book for an undergrad student majoring in this field."
4,"A good one, beautiful ballads","If you like Cristian Castro you know what to expect here and you are not going to be dissapointed, more ballads some chessie pop, and more ballads. if you like him, go for it."
5,Could this have really happened to some of our MIA's,"I started this book yesterday and finished it today. Couldn't put it down. Although unbelievably gory in the prison settings. I marveled at the hero's tenacity, and will to live. The twist with Sung was very imaginative and well done. This book seemed all to real to me given what I've read about the atrocities that occurred in Vietnam. This is a book that sheds light on a noble cause such as accounting for the MIA's. I would recommend it to everyone."
4,Good quality... a little oversized,"Bought these to replace older, non-matching kitchen tools. OXO work well and look nice but size-wise they are a bit large. Handles are extra long which is kind of overkill especially when using a small pot or pan. Grips are comfortable. Will have to invest in a new holder with a wide mouth to fit all tools comfortably. All is good, just be forewarned on size."
2,"Way too big for woman, 5' 6""","These tools are weirdly gigantic. I wish I had more carefully checked the reviews as I see several people mention the size. For people 6 feet tall and over, these will probably be terrific. They feel bizarre in my hands. I'd say they are about 30% too large for my comfort. For me, this reduces control and accuracy when moving the tools in corners of pans, etc. I'm going to make a gift of these to a large friend and shop for something else for myself."
2,OXO tool set,"Nice grip for non-slippery. The size is big, but not too big. It's easy to clean. I never put it in a dish washing machine though. After reading all the reviews, I put it up side down to dry out in order to let all the water out of the grips. However, I don't use this set much often because, it melted on the pan when I cook on high fire level. Not very impressed with that..."
2,Good quality...but didn't get what was listed,"The pieces I did receive are very nice - however, I did not receive a solid serving spoon. Instead the package included two straining spoons - which makes this ""tool set"" much less useful.I'm disappointed that an otherwise very good company could make such a basic mistake."
3,gift purchase,Purchased as a gift to go with a cookware set i purchased for my daughter. I wanted for her to have a good set of utensils for her new non-stick anodized set.
2,Too big.,"I wish there had been some information on the size of these tools. The product seems ok but the size really gets in the way. If you have really large pots and pans you may like it, but for me, they should have been at least one third smaller to be useable. I am a 6' tall guy who does a lot of cooking, so it's not that they are big for my hands, but having been in construction most of my life, I know when a tool doesn't fit. Not really for the regular kitchen."
5,great cooking utensils,"love OXO stuff and this utensils are great!! i own cuisinart, calphalon, and others.. these guys are very durable and do not bend when you are trying to stir something thick like my other ones do. just before not to let it rest on the hot metal portions too long (it is still make of plastic and will melt)."
5,Good Grips,We have not been disappointed with any of the OXO Good Grips items we have purchased. The grip is perfect for stable working with foods of all kinds. We will buy from this company again (if the ones we got ever wear out). Solid products and a good buy compared to the cheap ones also on the market for non-stick cookware.
3,Oxo 5 Piece Set,"I already own several Oxo good grips utensils and wanted to add to the collection. Purchasing the 5 piece set seemed to be a bargin over buying the individual pieces that I need. When these arrive, they were not manufactured the same as my original Oxo tools, they were considerably longer with larger heads and did not fit well in the utensil drawer. After just a couple of wash cycles, I could see evidence of water being trapped under the handles as another reviewer pointed out. Rather than return them I gave the set to my daughter and purchased the individual tools I needed locally."
1,Not Impressed....,"The ""relationship"" between the main characters seemed forced. I know these books are supposed to be about ""paranormal"" stories but as much as I enjoy reading such stories, this one was just not believable."
4,Love Lindsay McKenna's books usually,For some reason this book seemed to be slow at the beginning so it took me a while to get into it. I did enjoy it once the plot seemed to quicken up. I have been a fan for Linday's McKenna's books for a long time so will read the rest of the series.Rose
1,Just.....Bad.,"I don't think I got past the first couple of chapters, and that's really bad. With most books, I try to at least get through the first three chapters, thinking that most books start to hit their stride by then. This one never got out of the gate for me. Boring, trite, poorly written. 'Nuff said."
4,Loved it,This book has gotten a bad rep. It is a really good book. The characters had a lot of depth and the paranormal aspects were really something special. I would like to see more stories that follow the theme of this book. The book was left open in such a way that other stories could be written and I hope Nocturne will be around long enough for those stories to be published.
3,Country Bacon,"The product was fair, not as ""country"" as I would like, but better than you find in a grocery store."
4,Pretty Good if your looking for dance music,This is an ok cd. Don't buy this if you want a Ricky cd. His voice doesn't exist here. The guitar songs were great and I liked the Maria and Livin La Vida Loca dances.
5,1 Corinthians for the 21st Century,"1 Corinthians is one of my favorite books of the Bible. So, I am always interested in any Biblical literature on the subject.I would highly recommend this book by Ganz for both minister and Christian alike. It applies the book of 1 Corinthians to the 21st century and explains very well the background of the text.It is easy to read, exciting, and filled with examples from his long ministry that apply. Even if you do not agree with all he says, it is well worth the time to read."
4,Nice Surprise,"Being a hardcore Funkateer I was skeptical about someone elses interpretation of some of the best songs that P-FUNK ever made. This CD had a light, jazzy feel to it. It's something that should be played on a Sunday morning while reading the paper. While the turntable stuff did nothing for me, the instruments, especially the sax and bass, were tight. It is a great tribute to George Clinton and P-Funk when players like Clyde Stubblefield and Phil Upchurch join forces to remake their music.The best tracks are One Nation Under A Groove and Chocolate City. Again, the best way to describe it is (jazzy)funk. The style in which the sax is played helps to give it a light feeling. For all the devoted clones out there, you really should add this one to your collection."
4,Kronos strikes again,"Kronos and Dawn Upshaw (some of the most versitile performers around) come together to play this gut wrenching suite by Berg, who took serialism to a more emtional and musical level (perhaps more worthwhile than Webern...). Despite the amount of actual music on the CD being small...I think the purchase is most definitely worthwhile as the whole thing is VERY well done."
2,I hope the enthusiasts will forgive me ...,"... but there needs to be a warning here for casual listeners or those with more traditional tastes. If those describe you, this is not for you! However, this is a very emotional composition and I credit the Kronos Quartet for their masterful portrayal of the mental and emotional anguish that Alban Berg must have suffered as a result of the events which inspired this. I completely respect that, but to someone without advanced training in stringed instruments and early twentieth century classical music, it is, in a word, jarring."
4,Great kneepads!,"I have been using these kneepads at work for the past 4 years. These are the only kneepads I will use due to their comfort, durability, and craftmanship. I work at a grocery store stocking shelves overnight (graveyard) and am on my knees constantly. These kneepads have been great in their comfort."
1,way too big,"only a week till christmas. no time to return. my 13 year old son wanted these, they are way way way to big. only buy if you are really tall."
1,Not rubber!!! Hard plastice...sending back,"Very close to xmas and am pissed off! An earlier review said rubber so who wrote that review? Who wrote any of the good ones because these knee pads are not even functional. I'm sick of having to deal with these random stores selling their garbage! The knee pads are HUGE, they look more like butt pads (if one needed to protect their butt for some odd reason) THEY REFUSE TO BEND!! They are poorly made of hard rubber And are VERY uncomfortable! TRUST ME!! DON'T! Just don't..."
3,"No sophmore slump, Servant goes 2 for 2","ROCKIN' REVIVAL is Servant's most ""complete"" set of songs with no real missteps along the way. There is tremendous enthusiasm throughout the album in both the songwriting and playing and there isn't a dud in the bunch.It's a solid 3-star recording. I gave their debut 4 stars because it was such a cohesive package and while this may be a better album overall, it was ""more of the same"" but very well done."
5,Best fitness & dance shoes ever,Incanto wellness shoes are fantastic for dance and pilates. I love wearing them. They are so comfortable and smell good even after use. Where can my friends buy them as they seem to have disappeared?
1,A Limited Scope,"This is not a book for the serious artist; this is a book for someone searching for a unique hobby. Contained within are simplistic descriptions of the author's naive and limited techniques (he creates crafts, not pieces of art). He combines these instructions with over-simplified rules of composition and space. Furthermore, Bossom hardly explores the dangerous potentiality encaustic presents, which I think is negligent. For a better insight view Mattera's ""The Art of Encaustic Painting."""
1,Disappointed,"Mattera's book on encaustic seems to be the only good book out there on encaustic technique right now. Bossom's books are a step up from making melted crayon art in elementary school. I hate to be so rude, but the books are really not about encaustic painting, but about doing something with an iron and wax, and making one very particular style of art. Unless you want to make pictures just like Bossom's, this book is not in the least helpful. I write this review as a painter who uses encaustic techniques, so I feel I have some credentials to make such a harsh judgement."
3,For beginners,This book is excellent for beginners and those wishing to do small projects. It can be the start of an encaustic adventure.
1,dont get this book.,Skip this if yu are an encaustic painter. This is formula painting at its worst.
1,"Great show, terrible quality","When I saw the complete series of Dungeons and Dragons cartoon in one box set I just had to buy it. I've returned it twice so far. The first time the booklet fell apart. The second time, there was skipping on disk 4 with bad image quality. Looking at the disk, there were some scratches on it. I don't know how this passed quality control. Do they have quality control? Amazon can keep sending me replacements until it is done right. This is terrible.The complains I've read so far about the DVDs not being digitally remastered and the music being changed from what it was on TV seem accurate. This set is a disappointment."
4,Dungeons and Dragons animated DVD,I am very happy with the purchase. The product is in excellent condition and the delivery was prompt. My family enjoys watching the old cartoons.
5,my first order,"item was in great shape,was pleased all around,and will be using agian.i will recomend to any one i know ."
3,A blast from the past!,A fun cartoon from my youth. D&D lovers will enjoy it most. It brings out the geek in me lol.
3,A cool throw back to the good days of cartoons,"Simple stories, pretty predictable...but all in all of treat for the kids & the kids at heart. If your like me and haven't given up the cartoons, then I think you'll enjoy this."
4,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm,It's the full series..really loved this on Saturday mornings with cereal... I forgot how the concept of Dungeon Master vanishing each time was really annoying lol.
2,Not the good collection,"This edition of Dungeons & Dragons the Animated Series is the second release collection by Mill Creek, and not the BCI release. What does this mean? This means that the video quality of the collection is on par with what you can find one youtube, there are no special features (one of the highlights of the original BCI release), and the packaging is cheap and will aid in damaging the DVDs. All the episodes from the original run of the series are present and a good 90% of the original music is intact (one of the few complaints from the former BCI release). The biggest disappointment here is in the video quality, which on any non-analog television or LCD computer monitor is full of artifacts, and noise."
5,This Version has the Extras You May Want,"You might find places selling this series for a lot cheaper, but this particular version has all of the extra stuff like interviews and inserts.If you just want the series, then any of the other sets will do, there are no differences between the episodes, only the Bonus material.I've seen people comment on the ""music"" being redone, but the episodes on this edition and the other one have the same ""redone"" music. I think those who notice are purists --the average person who just wants a piece of nostolgia won't be bothered by it at all.I initially boughtDungeons & Dragons: The Complete Animated Series, but I wanted the commentary and the other bells and whistles."
4,Great vintage adventures,"My husband and I got this for our 3 year old because my husband watched it when he was younger. It's good enough that we watch it with our son. A bit dated of course, but good adventures, good characters."
4,Good memories,"As a person born in the early 1980's, I was around 7-8 years old when this cartoon came up. I was a very strong follower, but living in Mexico, it has kind of hard following up on the series. Actually, I don't remember ever watching all 27 episodes. A few months ago, I was hanging out with some friends and we started talking about cartoons from our childhood. Names like Bionic Six, Brave Star, and Dungeons & Dragons came up. After this, I looked for these series and was very pleased to at least find this one.Obviously, you can't compare the quality of the drawings with a recent cartoon, but actually, the story is pretty good, so you'll have quite a good time watching this series and remembering when you were young."
4,1980s Nostalgia,"Looked forward to seeing this every Saturday back in the 80s. Got mad at myself one Saturday when I slept too late and missed it! Glad the series is now available on DVD.I noticed that the music score has changed on many season 2 episodes. For example, in the episode ""Day of the Dungeon Master,"" I remember a completely different score during the scene at the end when Eric and Venger are fighting. Ditto for the scene where the kids are being chased by the dragon while flying on the giant eagle. I know this to be true because I have this episode on video. Lame picture quality compared to the DVD, but at least the drama of the battle scenes is preserved.Despite the above mentioned complaints, it's been fun reliving these adventures all over again. I highly recommend it!"
2,Only ok,"Its only ok first of all everyone needs to know that the series does not end so you don't really get an ending to the story. Also one of my disc did not work so that was not a good thing. At the price I paid I let it go because it would have been more trouble to send it all back but the disc that did show were what I expected the TV show from my youth. Purchase the product only if you want to reminisce on old times. If you were looking for a a full story with beginning, middle, and end this is not it."
2,Twice D&D Handbook Contents Ripped Out.,"Well I would have loved to watch it....but I am a purist. I ordered this and it arrived, the D&D Handbook having its contents ripped from the binding.....twice. Wonder if the are having a problem at the factory."
3,"Just the eps, ma'am","If you want to see the show from the 80s and that is all, this is the product for you.Beware the other reviews imported over from the previous comprehensive release - this is bare bones and produced cheaply! There are zero extras in this edition - NONE.Within the case you'll find paper sleeves with the discs - I didn't even know they bothered with packaging like that anymore.If I had gotten this off of eBay I would have been convinced it was a cheap bootleg - the first shipment gave me a disc 1 that didn't work at all.But, for pure 80s cartoon action, they make it easy. There's a ton of eps on each disc and, thankfully, they put a play all option on the menu as a default for each disc. No frustration like those early Simpsons seasons having to pick each ep individually!"
4,Great show!,"I remember watching this years ago and I stumbled upon an article that mentions this show and I knew I wanted to see it again. Once I found this DVD on Amazon, I immediately bought it and was quite happy. Have to thank Amazon for helping me relive my childhood! :)"
3,Dungeons & Dragons,"I love this cartoon as a kid and I still love it. My only problem is, the version that is currently being sold, does not have any special features, nothing on the un produced last episode :(The set comes in a case, but the individual dvds are in cheap paper sleeves. The set was only 5 dollars, i guess I cant complain too much."
4,Good price for hours of fun.,"I grew up when Dungeons & Dragons was on and always had fond memories of it. However, when I rented a disc of episodes to share with my 5 and 8 year olds, I was ashamed at the quality of these old cartoons. The kids LOVED them, lol. So, when the purchase price was so low, why not and the kids still love to watch them.Good family fun at a great price, do it!"
2,damaged packaging,I received two copies both of which has damaged packaging. All of the pages fell out of book right away when opened in both cases as well. There seems to be some problem in manufacturing.
3,A decent enough kid's show from the 80's. Horrid packaging.,"I vaguely recall this show from the 80's. Figured I'd give it a rewatching. Not as good as I recalled it being. But then I'm sure my tastes have changed since I was 8.I have to say however that I *despise* the packaging. It's horrible! You've got the oversized outer plastic case. But then rather than have any kind of brackets or clips for the DVDs like a normal case, it just has the discs in paper sleeves in a shoddy holder. Who designed this case? Homer Simpson? Worst ... design ... ever!So, yeah, okay show. Horrible packaging."
4,Digipak with handbook,"a caixa chegou lacrada mas o item tem algumas avarias, tray do digipak quebrado, capa do handbook solta e um esfolfado no cardboard. Mas valeu a pena.Fora isso o produto é lindo demais. Voc~e tem outro item igual com handbook?the box came sealed but the item has some damage, the tray digipak is broken, loose cover of the handbook and a damage in the cardboard. But worth it.Than that the product is beautiful too. you have another item with handbook?"
1,"it's guilty of the worst of sins, it's unfinished.","Dungeon and Dragons is about some kids that take a carnival ride only to be warped into the alternate universe that is Dungeons and Dragons, their they meet Dungeon Master who immediately gives them magical weapons to aid in defending against the many threats that roam the land and promises to aid in their efforts to try to find a way back home.buying a series, the complete series becomes hollow without an ending, this is the case with Dungeons and Dragons, I bought it because of fond memories and because it suddenly disappeared and I hadn't seen the conclusion.sadly their is none.the 2nd great sin that this series suffers from is writer fatigue, literally the last few episodes seemed ""phoned in"" brutally simple, uninspired and even for a cartoon just plain silly, that the characters never really grow as the show went on is just another negative.save your money, it's an empty experience without 2 more episodes to wrap it up."
3,Great series...lousy hardware,I ordered two sets and both had discs with digital hits. Maybe Amazon got a bad batch. Buyer beware.
5,Reliving my Saturday mornings before I even knew what D&D was,"I recently purchased Dungeons and Dragons Anthology The Master Collection for my laptop, and since then I've been reading books and watching DVDs about the history of D&D. Finding this animated series for less than $10 was the best bargain I've EVER seen on Amazon. Stop reading this and go order it!"
4,pretty good.,"nothing like watching cartoons that take you back to the 80s. I must say in time , it is not the same effect, but honestley there is a story line , show to show. I like the quality of the show , and it is entertaining:) GOOD TIMES.As i have said bout other cartoons, that is just what they are ,CARTOONS, not to be taken seriously. Hay , enjoy , and watch this show , i sure did , and i like it:)"
5,A blast from the past,"This show was by far my favorite when i was a kid, and i have actually owned this same essential set a couple of times, but then lent them out, lost them, whatever. So, i bought it AGAIN! Anyway, i like going back and watching these episodes from time to time. Good fun. Enjoy!"
4,Simple and fun to watch.,"Its been long time when I use to watch this show as a little kid on Saturdays morning. Its strange to watch something old, and also how many little life lessions that are thrown in the show. Dungeno Master always talks about some sort of lesson learns. Still the show is very enjoyable to watch. Show about young adults tring to find a way home. Only to encounter hard chooices about doing the right thing. Vilance is very mild and monsters are drawn simple, not scarry. Hope to show this to my kids one day when they get older. Even though the name was base off a game, it does not really flow with the game. The show is just diffirent. It may not be for everyone, but it is nice to watch and if your watching with with your child. You can enjoy that even though its a just a cartoon show. There are lessons in, like seeds in a field. Only time for plant to take root. As for me, its nice to watch something and remmber the old days a bit, even if its just for a little while."
3,Loved the episodes but...,"I was expecting to get all the ""perks"" that others listed they recieved with their copies only to discover what I recieved was the episodes only. Dont get me wrong.. I loved the show just disappointed that it wasnt specified that you were only getting 3 discs and none of the other perks."
1,Worst packaging EVER!,"Do not buy this product if you want discs in any kind of decent condition. I don't know who came up with the idea to have a plastic dvd case holding discs in paper sleeves, but they should be slapped in the face. Every disc was scratched and in poor condition (they really thought it would arrive otherwise). Its too bad. This was an enjoyable series as a kid and I wanted my kids to be able to enjoy it also. Stay away!"
5,lov it,This is exactly what i had expected. It is still great after all these years. I would highly reccomend for anyone who has not seen the series!
4,Great...can I get extra trays?,"I have had this for about 4 years and have used it quite a few times. I have never had a problem with mold, mildew, slime or the water siphoning correctly. You should add water once a day and dump it once it gets to the bottom tray. I always throw the used tray in the dishwasher beofre starting it with new seeds.I am preparing to improve my diet to eat mostly raw food and would like to eat a lot more sprouts. This unit is a little small for the sprouting needs of a large family. I wish I could get extra trays for it. But it is so cheap, I guess I could just buy a second unit."
2,plastic cracks easy,"does the job but won't last long. mine started cracking after 2 months of use. Leaves bottom too wet for smaller seeds, they will tend to rot. my advice is to use canning jars with cheese cloth covers."
1,So close...,Not quite sure what the design flaw is here. The lid was too flimsy and I man-handled it trying to get it off.... rip! The drainage system requires that the tiers be raised at an angle for it to properly drain each level. Got to be a better mousetrap! Is it bpa free? That is the real question...?
1,Don't waste your money,"Water didn't drain, seeds kept getting stuck in the filters. We sent it back and didn't even get a full refund....ugh."
1,returned,"I have had 2 sprouters prior to this one. No problems. This one, I returned after using one time. The water did not drain well even following directions. I wake up at 4:30 AM for work, and dont have time to fuss with something that does not work easily or properly. Would not recommend this."
3,Bean Sprouter,"I had a sprouter similar to this in the UK and thought this would be as good. However I have found that one still needs to spend time tipping the sprouter trays on their side to drain the water as, if you just pour the water through, water is left in the seed trays making them smell overnight. Especially with large seeds.It is also not easy to keep all the trays balanced.However, on the whole I like it and am using it daily."
2,Only for large seed sprouts,"The Victorio tray sprouter works fine for large seed sprouts (like lentil) but I've had no luck with small seeds like alfalfa or red clover. Even when I sprout the seeds first in a jar then put them in the Victorio, the sprout roots are still so tiny they plug up the holes in the trays.If you only want to grow large seed sprouts then this Victorio is convenient. But even then the sprouts don't get much air circulation, so they don't seem as vigorous.Too bad, it looked so simple and semi-automatic. I had high hopes for it."
3,Easy to use but,"I purchased this particular sprouter because of good reviews & the fact that I could start 3 different sprouts at the same time. It is easy to use but the bad news is that not all the water drains out which, I found out, causes sprouts not to grow & in particular, broccoli sprouts to smell putrid & not sprout at all! I would rinse 6-7 times a day & have had marginal success with any of the sprouts that I use. Today I did some research & discovered that you absolutely must do evertying to make sure no water remains in the containers. I haven't given up but think I may go back to the old fashioned way of sprouting...a jar & cheesecloth!"
1,same problem as others,"I have the same problem as others. Sprouts get stuck in drain, nipples don't drain fully, tipping the trays moves the spouts around and degrades their quality. Draining therefore takes 20 minutes while I coax it all through. If small spouts are not good for this product (and that's the case), company should include LARGER ones and state as much. There should be a way to drain the trays without tipping. I don't get why some people seem to have great luck with this sprouter and others, like me, don't. But it should consistently work as advertised and it obviousy doesn't. I would NOT recommend this product."
1,moldy sprouts,"I have been sprouting with mason jars and screens for a long time, and have never had a problem. I ordered this sprouter because it seemed convenient, less cumbersome, and much more compact than a bunch of jars draining in my sink. I mainly wanted to sprout sunflower and mung beans. The way this sprouter is made does not allow the water to drain out of the trays completely, so all my sprouts were sitting in water and became a moldy mess. I am returning the sprouter and going back to my good old glass mason jars!"
2,Shop carefully!!!,"This sprouter has ONE tiny hole for drainage in the bottom of each tray. No air circulation and poor, very slow drainage. I took a very small drill bit and drilled extra holes in each tray so that they would drain better when I rinse the seeds and also so that they don't sit in water. The plastic material is nice and sturdy and I liked the fact that they gave me 3 trays for sprouting. I constantly worried about mold until I put the extra holes in."
5,Seed Sprouter,"I bought my Sprouter because I had tried the jar method with no success . This is inexpensive and simple to use. I have not soaked my seeds, I water twice a day, emptying the tray before each watering and in just a couple days I have wonderful sprouts for my salads. I love it and wish I had bought one sooner !"
1,Item arrived damaged,"Received this as a gift for Christmas. The bottom tray arrived cracked, rendering the whole thing useless. May not have been manufacturer's fault, but it reflects the durability of this product."
2,BE AWARE!!!!!,"I received Victorio Seed Sprouter from Amazon two weeks ago and althoug I think it is an ingenious idea, I gave it 2 stars because I am disappointed. In the product description in amazon.com it says it comes with organic alfalfa seeds and the one I received didn't come with any seeds even when the papers that come with the Seed Sprouter say very clear ""Organic Alfalfa Seeds Included"". I called Victorio's phone number and I complained about the seeds, they said they were going to send me the alfalfa seeds and I am still waiting. I also think it would be a good idea to make the trays a little taller so the sprouts could grow a little taller. I'll update my review if I receive the alfalfa seeds.11/26/2011 Update: I finaly received the sample seeds from the manufacturer."
1,this product is so so,I bought this to see if I should buy some for my grand kids. No way. It is cute but that is about the only thing good I can say about it.
2,Avid Sprouter gives Thumbs Down,"I sprout a lot, and figured for the price I would try this three tray to see if I could safe a little counter space. The design leaves a bit of standing water in every tray, which is condusive to mold. the standing water can also give a bit of a tangy/not fresh taste to even larger bean sprouts as they never fully rinse off. It may work better for someone who lives in little/no humidity, but I live in houston and you really need to rinse your sprouts to keep them fresh and free of mold. Even 4x a day rinsing wasnt enough to get rid of standing water at the bottom.I suggest canning jars with cheap screen netting you can get at a local drug store and a canning ring to attach them. You keep upside down in a dish drainer, it lets all the water out to sprout, and is easy to rinse."
5,Works Great,"Having read the other reviews about the product not draining well and problems with mold etc. I was skeptical. However, I find if you do NOT place the covers tightly on the drain holes, line up the drains when stacking the pieces and place something under the side of the sprouter on the opposite side of the drains (tipping the whole container slightly), it drains well and works beautifully. A little trouble, but I want to grow a good variety at once in small batches without it taking up a lot of room. The trade off is worth it.PS you do have to be sure that the sprouts do not block the drain by growing under the drain cover"
2,Water doesn't drain well,"This unit does indeed sprout seeds well if you can get the water to drain through the siphon tubes. About 50% of the time, the water will fill up in one or more of the trays will refuse to drain. Of course this causes the flooded trays to rot and prevents the lower trays from getting water. If you lift the unit about an 1/8"" off the counter and let it drop back down, the water will often begin to flow, but not always. Sometimes I have to tilt the unit from one side to the other until enough pressure builds up around the siphon tube.All in all, it would work well if it drained properly."
1,"Was shipped two different models, one almost unworkable","Ordering a few days apart, I got two very different models (but with the same model number). One was as pictured, with 3 transparent growing trays, 1 white tray; it is hard plastic. This model drains with a single nipple, so that if the trays are on a surface that is even slightly non-level, each tray will have a different amount of water; in particular it could have standing water in part of the tray. The other version has several design differences, the most important being drains all around the rims of the trays, instead of the single nipple.I would judge the nipple model pictured online to be difficult to clean (by hand), because of the nipples' complicated design, with small crannies. Also the nipple model has only 3 growing trays, while the other has 4. For $10, I can't be bothered to repackage it, but in a store, I would certainly return the model pictured, in favor of the larger one with better design."
2,Siphoning is not Seamless,"I like the concept, design, and small footprint. That being said, the siphoning action does not happen seamlessly. It takes a lot more attention and effort than I expected to have to devote to the sprouting process. I will probably return this and look for a more efficient sprouter."
5,Great sprouter,"In the past, I have used mason jars for sprouting. When we moved, I lost my lids.To replace them would have cost $5 a lid in the store! For a piece of plastic withsome holes in it! So I went to Amazon and ran across this Kitchen Seed Sprouterby Victorio. I have used it for a week and am glad I lost the lids. This is somuch more convenient. It has an ingenious rinsing system that only requires puttingwater in at the top 2 or 3 times a day and removing it at the bottom after about15 minutes. It looks nice on the counter too."
2,Leaves sprouts wet and moldy,"Good idea with the siphons, but they don't drain properly, so sprouts sit in water. In California, that means mold, bugs, and rot. Nice effort, but design needs to go back to the drawing board. And when I called the company to ask them some basic questions, they didn't know the answers and directed me to a store that carriers their products, and who don't recommend them. very strange, but it just goes to show that the company's just not very serious. I'm back on amazon to find a more effective sprouter."
1,Product arrived broken,Sprouter was in intact bubble wrap in an un damaged box and was smashed. Someone had to pack it that way.Disgruntled employee?
1,Sour Seeds - does not drain - too much time,"I used with alfalfa seeds as provided. They clogged the caps when they got under there.. I had to adjust every time I watered it.. I can grow in a pot better than this. I tried other seeds, radishes soured. Lentils smelled funky. Everything soured. I watered 4 times a day and had to drain the top tier 3/4 times with 1/8 the seeds going down the drain each time. What a mess and what a waste. I tried turning caps and leaning and all the things recommended by others but nope.. still soured. I returned it. I'm sticking with a basket in a large pot leaned to one side. I get thousands of little sprouts that way that don't stink from rot."
5,I WILL NO LONGER BUY IN STORE...,"I can not believe how great this item works. My son got this for me, because i'm always buying sprouts every week at the local market. Very expensive. Also the taste is so much fresher. Love to put on my kitchen counter and watch grow. With in a couple of days you will have sprouts ready to eat. Never go to the store for this again. Plus the seeds from Amazon are much cheaper on here than at local heath food store. $4.99 an 4 once here. $15.99 for alfalfa seeds on Amazon. You do the math."
4,Work good,"Nice product with good design.I am sprouting alfalfa seeds and they grow really well.It is a pretty small sprouter, and it could be good for a small family. It is not for massive production."
4,Great Product,I really like this product. It is contained and small for 3 different types of sprouts. I really love sprounts and it works very quickly with little mess. AWSOME...Laurie
4,Works great....,We really liked it especially because we sprout almost everyday. This really helps and is very neat. The only thing worries me though is the quality of plastic they use.Other thing is the product pictures show wheatgrass and I am wondering how do you do that? Has anybody tried it? Please post your experience.
1,Not for serious sprout growing,"This is what I am calling a ""hokey"" sprouter. It's small, hard to clean (with all the little grooved circles on the bottom) and doesn't rinse the sprouts well at all. My sprouts end up slimy and rotten every time. Sprouts should be rinsed VERY well, this unit does not allow proper rinsing, the vessels are to small and the syphoning action way to slow to provide a good rinse. It's one of the useless things to spend money on. I should have known better."
3,Sprouter.....lids split,I bought 2 of these Kitchen crop sprouters. Both of the lids have split badly along the sides and top of it. I have had them for only about a month.
4,great little sprouter,"It worked well and quickly. The only complaint I have is that the sections should be taller. The sprouts quickly grew bigger than the container. I bought a different sprouter, too, but this one works the best."
2,I Really Wanted to Like This But...,"This appeared to be the answer to keeping our large family ""in sprouts."" We had been using the canning jar method before, with an ill-fitting screw-on screen top that came off half the time while draining. The Victorio's elegant design and reasonable price were attractive, but after several weeks of trying it out there are some functionality issues.The trays do not consistently drain unless the little outlets are constantly tweaked...even the ""water only"" level, so it's not because of getting clogged with growing sprouts. (But designing a tray that is BOUND to become clogged with sprouts was not a good idea, anyway!) This is my main complaint and a serious design flaw. It would have been better to design the trays as being sieves themselves instead of this so-called siphoning design that doesn't actually work. What happens is, WHEN the water manages to flow down the layers at all, it happens so slowly as to cause rot instead of rinsing."
3,Edición casera,"Es un buen libro, buen contenido e información. Está dirigido a Luthiers más que a músicos. Hay muchos datos interesantes e ideas para mantener nuestros instrumentos de cuerda ""saludables"". No debe faltar en la bibilioteca de ningún músico. El diseño es bastante elemental. Es un libro pequeño y escrito a dos columnas. Inglés elemental."
3,"Works Great, But Hate the Smell","I love they way this product feels in my hair, but the scent is way too strong and it's expensive. It smells like a strong perfume...not something you'd think would be appropriate for hair. For as expensive as it is, I'd prefer that it smelled better. Not to mention with as much product as I use in my full, curly head of hair...this is not economical."
2,not too good,It leave my hair very hard and crisp not sleek and shine very disappointed i bought two and now have to return one of them.
2,Do NOT buy!!!,"Please do not waste your money on Paul Mitchell if it's not from a salon. I bought this and realized quickly it is old! VERY OLD!!! It smells so bad. I have used this conditioner in the past (bought from a salon) and it smelled great! This stuff smells awful. It still works well, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but it does smell. I then thought to look at the bottom of the bottle. I believe it expired in September 2011. I bought it in October 2012. Need I say more?"
1,The smell is just okay,"I did not purchase this conditioner from Amazon. I gave it 1 star for the okay smell...its nothing to brag about seriously. This conditioner left my hair dry and my hair felt hmm...thirsty?! I really wanted to like this product and even used it for a whole week as a conditioner (for wash and go's) and a small amount for a leave in to layer in with gel. I initially thought it must be the way I am using the conditioner so I tried it on my daughter's hair and it was the same thing. Her hair actually looked worse than mine. The next day I promptly co-washed her hair with Totally Twisted and voila, her hair was back to normal. I will not repurchase this product again, I did return it to the department store I bought it from with no questions asked. I am sure this will work for others but for my 4b/4c natural hair...NO THANKS! Oh well, I guess on to the next....."
4,Great product,"I am of african descent and my hair is relaxed. I now use ' The conditioner' leave in moisturiser, makes my hair incredibly soft (i have been using this about 4 months).Plus I started using the Awapuhi moisture mist (only 4 days now) but so far it has been absultely amazing.The last bit of softness and mositure that I needed to stay in my hair and take it from day to day seems to have been accomplished with this.I have been very impressed with his line. It is a bit pricey (especially since where I am I pay almost double the price) but it has been giving good results for me.I highly recommend.I will update, should I notice that it is not living up to my previous recommendation."
5,So Soft!,"Makes my hair soft, smooth and feel super healthy. My hair has never been shinier, and I am so glad I took the leap and bought it despite the cost."
3,Listen to the CD and then see them live.,"The CD needs a little help on the recordings but if you go to one of their gigs, they can rock the house to another level that you will want to see them again and again...."
4,"Get it for the binoculars, not the camera","This product is a great idea, but no manufacturer has been able to combine a great camera with the binoculars. The camera always seems to suffer in comparison.Nonetheless, this is great for its application."
2,camera sucks,"I got this camera binocular for my husband for a christmas present, thinking this would be awesome to take on trips or to concerts and take pictures. But no matter how steady you hold the binoculars when you take a picture it always comes out so blurry that you dont even know what you took a picture of. I even tried it on a tripod we had around the house and it still took a horrible picture. Im planning on returning it."
3,"Pretty good, but the sizing chart is messed up","I'm a size 32 men's waist, so I purchased a medium harness based on the sizing chart, but I definitely should have gone with a small, there's enough room to fit a kangaroo between the harness and my waist."
3,"I mean, it definitely gets the job done.","As the title says it does get the job done. It's not the most comfortable harness, and the straps are a little hard to adjust; especially the front/main strap. With that said, I can still belay and auto belay with ease and no problems. I would recommend this harness for a beginner but if you are planning on using this for longer belays I would consider another harness."
3,Climbing harness,"Nice harness, just not exactly what I thought it was,Im built like a pear and does not fit right, yes pear"
5,Comfortable and affordable harness,"This is a great harness for beginner and intermediate level climbers. I am currently using it for top rope indoor climbing, and as said in the title, it is comfortable. It has good leg loops and a solid waistband. It is also a great deal when compared to the prices of other harnesses that seem to be of similar quality."
5,Looks good! Came fast,"As a prime member I paid $3.99 for next day arrival. I ordered it yesterday a little after noon and today around 11am I noticed it was on my porch!I am 32"" waist and it fits good. I am climbing tomorrow so if it hold up and I'm alive, I'll update this review!UPDATED 4/9/12: Worked great. Pretty comfortable. Everything held. I lived...!"
4,Climb on,"Bought this item, but the brown one, way back. Great fit. Easy access to tools and beeners. Really love it. Looks cool, though that really has little to do with the experience of climbing anyway. =) Easy to get in and out of, no confusion, no muss."
4,Nice harness size is misleading.,I'm pretty slim and this 'medium' barely fits around my waist. Just a warning. A fine product for me otherwise.
4,Great Budget Harness,"I bought this harness when I was doing mainly gym climbing and it worked reasonably well in that role... There's nothing partiularly special about the harness other than the $. It's pretty comfortable to sit in (not the most comfortable, but decent), the gear loops have held up very well, and it's fully adjustable. I recently took it out on a full day of trad climbing with at least 8 rappels and it still held up to the job quite well. If you aren't doing a ton of long routes or specialized climbing, this is it. At 33"" in waist, I'm just over the center of the adjustment range for the medium."
4,Great Harness,"Great Harness. Very light weight, comfortable. When you drop from 10-15 feet, it does not hurt/pain at all.Seller is great too. Got my shipment few days in advance. Superfast shipment."
3,Value: Get what you pay for.,I feel like most reviews are based on value. I bought this product here on amazon for 25 dollars total! the current price at 45 dollars after shipping is just outrageous to me. I would never have bought this hose for $45. But at a 25 dollar value this couldnt be beat. It leaks. Its a cheap plastic and its only a 1/2 inch hose. At 25 dollars id purchase it a 2nd time but really not for a penny more. It is not worth any more than that. You can buy a good hose and reel for about 50 bux and get something 2-3times better than this.Just so you know this hose is not rated for clean drinking water.
4,hose reel,"Just what I wanted and could no longer get at Lowe's. Works well, is barely noticeable from the street and stores easily in the garage in the winter."
4,Always reliable.,We needed to replace an old hose/reel identical to this one that was 15+ years old and were happy to find another online. Especially happy to have one that doesn't take up too much space. Works great!
5,My Favorite Yoga Book,"Simple, easy, feels great. Of course different people will enjoy different yoga styles. Most of these postures are lying down or sitting. This book is definitely worth adding to your understanding."
5,Excellent,Short and precise.With detailed description on how to take note of certain body requirements.
2,Hard to get worse than this,"Yo-Yo Ma's rendition of Cesar Franck's sonate for cello is by far the worse I have ever heard. It sounds like a shopping mall version where all the asperities and emotional elements have been removed. The disservice to Faure's sonata is just as bad (if not worse as the transcription for cello has been done by Yo-Yo Ma himself). Smooth short transcriptions by Saint-Saens and Massenet helps this SACD not to get a 1 star. Unless you prefer ""tame"" versions of masterworks, this SACD is not for you."
5,"Great food, easy to feed.","I set out 4 or 5 pieces of this food on a plate, add a little water or juice, wait 5 minutes then hand feed them. My beardie loves them and hand feeding is fun. Then it's off to the sink for a warm water soak for a couple of minutes which usually results in a number 2 action, so no dirty cage to clean. Backk under the heater to warm and then free reign of the house for awhile."
3,Call it a 3.5,"The game starts very slowly. Eventually it picks up a little. Can actually be a little scary in spots. Now for the rest. Graphics are max payneish. Lots of fog and more fog and more fog. The combat parts aren't to great, let's face it, this guy['s tuff]. Something to try, but won't be played over and over. Oh yeah and the game saves are goofy. Get it as cheap as possible."
2,Where do I start,"Ok. This game i rented hoping to have a good action-storyline based game. Well theres a story line, and i have to day its a good one. But the fun in this game lacks, its can be addictive, but unless you have alot of time on your hands, its not really great. The graphics are top notch the gameplay is good, the setup overall is good. But after paying for awhile i lost intrest and put it down. If you are someone who likes strategy, lots of thinking and lots of time, this game is for you. But if you are someone who likes fast paced action and exitement this game is not for you. I do have to day at times there is some action and some horror, but not much, so this game i give to stars for the graphics, and for the lack of intrest and fun."
2,Not my kind of game,"This isn't necessarily a bad game, but I found the difficult controls and awkward fighting to be annoying. Fans of Max Payne, Halo, and other games of that ilk should consider renting this game before buying it."
1,BORING HILL,I do not know where this game gets its reviews but i am beginning to think the manufacture has paid someone to put these ridiclus reviews up here. To be VERY honest this game (is no good). the graphics are intesly awsome. but remember it is played on the XBOX so it has to be. The game play is extremely boring. If you like HALO and MAX PAYNE then please do not waste your time. I had to return mine and i will also email konami and ask them what were they thinking!
2,Pathetic attempt at a video game,"After 30 minutes of game play my character walked about 100 miles through thick fog and junk graphics. I came to 6 dead-ends, and killed like 5 guys (which is really hard when the player control totally sucks). I've played this type of game before and usually they are ok. But if this game moved any slower it would be on pause. If you are looking for a game with a creepy feel, then this is it. But if you are looking for a game to entertain you...pick something else. I was bored to death playing this."
5,"Now, that was scary!!!","This game was really good. This was the first time I played a game of this type. The controls were a little tricky, but that was the 3d control option, change it to the 2d control option, it is a lot easier. The graphics were great, the sound was right on the money, it can be very spooky at times. For the low price now, its worth getting, trust me..."
4,Do not play on xbox 360,"Just a warning, I got this to play on xbox 360 and ran into glitch after glitch - one I had to research, delete my saved game and start all over, the other I can't get past since it just doesn't load an area so I can't go any further in the game.The below site details a lot of glitches, not including the second game ending one I ran into.[...]So yeah, either get this if you have an original old school xbox or get the ps2 version if you have that."
1,Poor product,"I REALLY like this game! However, I gave it only 1 star based on the fact that it stopped working 3 months after I purchased it!"
4,Action Thriller Chiller,"This game chilled me to the bone all the way until the end. I literally had to have my roomate stay in the living room and watch me play the game, because I was afraid to play alone. This game so far is the scariest game I've ever played!Now for the downsides: Camera angles are choppy, boss fights (or any fight) is clumsy, and the storyline is cryptic (much like most Japanese storylines)But overall: Worth the play."
3,It's an ok game,First I would like to state that if you are one of those people who like to start a game & be able to get into it right away then this game is not for you. This game takes too long to get you involved & after a while of playing the game I just got bored with it because you have to do everything in order basically to be able to get anywhere in the game which makes beating it very tedious. I thought the game sounded good but after I bought it I realized it wasn't for me (one of those types of people who like action all the way through the game no matter what happens) I would have to say that this game has great graffix & a great storyline so if you are the kind of person that likes to sit down for hours at a time to figure out games & puzzles then maybe this game is your kind of game. But for the fact that it takes too long (in my mind) to get involved in the game & takes a lot to keep you involved then I will have to give it a 3
3,Another short game.,"I'm starting to think that I should quit buying my games and just rent them all. SH2 took me 9h 45m to finish. While I enjoyed the game and was creeped out a few times, I just can't feel comfortable recommending a... title that gives less than a short weekend of gameplay. The game does have 4 endings, but who's really interested in playing through the game 4 time just to see a different 30 second ending movie. Not me. I played SH2 with the lights down and the surround sound up, and was spooked just as good (if not better) than a decent horror flick. Stalking dark hallways with a flashlight while watching for zombies was pretty cool. The puzzles weren't particularly difficult, and the writing (as usual) was B level quality at best. The graphics and textures are gruesome, as are some of the cutscenes. This one's rated ""M"" for a reason parents. While I do recommend it for fans of action/adventure/puzzle/horror games, I really wish the game was longer though...thus the 3 stars."
4,"Nice job making this thing ""Creepy""","Don't play this thing at home in the dark while you are alone. This thing is creepy! The characters, the surroundings, the SOUNDS!!! I dare you to play this thing with your surround sound on at night and not get creeped out. While these first person games are not my thing, my wife has fallen in love with it. It is the only game she even cares to play, and by play I mean, I have to sit next to her to keep her safe from the scary stuff.. It is a little slow and you do a lot of running around aimlessly...However, like the guide says, James, the main character is not a super hero. He is clumsy and is just an average guy with average skills. He doesn't shoot straight, he misses and falls a lot too. But for the creepiness and realism factor, it is addictive."
3,Author asked me to stop reading her books!,"I read the Bride series and loved it. Inside each of her books, she gives her e-mail address for feedback. I found a major typo in this book and also had feedback on the book and when I wrote to her, here is what she wrote back:You know what, (my name) -- don't read me anymore. Thank you, Catherine Coulter.I was shocked that an author who makes her living through her fans could be so ungrateful."
2,Not a keeper,"We all know that Catherine Coulter can and has done so much better. This book lacks characterization and depth and leaves too many questions unanswered. Yet it is nice to visit with old ""friends."""
2,Not up to the usual standard,I was disappointed in the latest addition to the Sherbrooke series. The plot was a weak replay of others she's written and I found myself dozing off in places. Catherine Coulter is usually so much better! Left too many loose ends and didn't wrap up the plot well at all.
1,BEWARE,"I had high hopes for this book. I have read many hsitorical romances and I have read Ms. Coulters FBI series. I assumed that I would love this book and would be running out to buy all her historical romances. Well you know what happens when you ASSUME.This book was awful. The charaters were not inviting, the story was too drawn out and the cat racing. What was up with that!?!? I should have stopped right there. I think the characters had potential but the dialog was so convoluted you simply didn't care. As for the mystery, it started more than half way into the book. By the time I got to it I just wanted the pain to stop so I read the last two chapters and put the book away.I will not be reading any more of her historical romances but I will keep up with the FBI series which also has its faults but it is much more enjoyable."
1,Unbearably bad read,"Pendragon is the fifth book in the Sherbrooke Brides series, a sequel to The Scottish Bride. I'm afraid I just skimmed through it, too much catracing and other stuff and very little writing actually on the hero and heroine. Not much on the romance. I didn't learn much about the hero, Thomas, and Meggie grown up is such an unsympathetic character I was sorry for Thomas he ended up with her. Also, I hated Calypso Magic, because I don't want a romance involving a slave plantation (I don't want to read about the exploitation of black slaves) and Jeremy is back and he still owns that slave plantation. I read too much romance and Coulter used to be a pleasant enough read but I think I'm too picky now, I don't like light historicals anymore and I don't like that wedding night thing, why do the women always act so surprised and hate it so much, doesn't seem realistic to me. If you like light historicals you might like this book but I would suggest start at the beginning of the series."
2,Nothing like the old Catherine Coulter,"This was a very erratic book. I've read every Catherine Coulter historical romance and loved them all, but this one was very strange. Not enough character background and some very jumpy/scattered writing. It's almost as if it used to be longer and was chopped up to be shorter, leaving some of the flowery feeling-type info out. Very strange."
1,I was disappointed with the content of this book.,"This book is essentially a transcript of a workshop. It discusses in general terms some interesting concepts and experiences regarding well maintenance and rehabilitation. It is lacking in real usable information. The author's strength is microbiology and some interesting general observations are presented. I returned the book (the first time I have returned a technical book). Good information on well rehabilitation is available in ""Groundwater and Wells"" by Driscoll and also in ""Construction Dewatering"" by Powers."
4,"Excellent book, well worth every penny","I think at a first glance this book is a little bit imposing, and it would seem that this is why it is met with apprehension. However, after reading it I realized that the radical concepts are what keep people liking the book. If you are willing to forget what you have been taught because it is wrong, and embrace the truth that this author has discovered through experience, then buy this book."
4,Catch the Irish Laughter,"What would an Hungarian/German immigrant know about Irish humour? After reading Dave Abbott's delightful book a lot more, and I enjoyed every delicious bit of Irish wit and wisdom included in this ""must-have"" book. Abbott is a great story teller, and a remarkably good writer: the two don't always come together in one person. There were dozens of jokes I of course had heard over the years, and having been briefly engaged to a ""mad Irishman"" I even knew a little about their origin. Abbott's work is refreshing and compelling, especially when he talks about the fascinating people has has known, such as Kathleen Behan. Moreover, the bit of Irish history he does include makes me want to read more about those ""fightin' Irish.""

4,Non-Irish should catch this green disease,"Dave Abbott's CATCH THE IRISH LAUGHTER has even me -- a non Emerald Isle resident laughing. If as Norman Cousins said ""Laughter is the best medicine"" then this 122-page book is a medical recipe for any type of ailment.Although Dave Abbott is known world-wide for his speaking humour his translation to the Gutenberg-format has caught this acoustical rhythm. From his Irish ""Spy stories"" to those about pilots will throughly exercise your laughing mechanisms.Don't just stand there and listen to me: go buy the book.Frank Ogden ""Dr. Tomorrow"""
4,Printer Switch Box,This works great if you have two printers hooked up to your computer as I do. It is a no brainer to hook up too and it gives you the convience of using two printers. It was delivered quick and packed well. The right choice for me
3,"Eventually combine the two, please","Combining Vasks' Fourth String Quartet with Berg's Lyric Suite (the latter features an underused, unfocused Dawn Upshaw) would make a worthy, if not an interesting addition to anyone's contemporary music library. Currently, these pieces are available only as separate releases--by themselves, no filler--which leads one to surmise a regrettable marketing/creative miscalculation on the part of the record company or the musicians. Otherwise, the Kronos quartet deliver powerfully convincing performances of each, and one only hopes these recordings would be preserved in a future 1-CD release. Both were nominated for a Grammy this year so I got them both and took the (financial) bullet for them."
5,Harp Guitar Magic,"I was first introduced to the harp guitar by Michael Hedges in the Eighties. Here was this mutant guitar with a dozen or more strings that as it turns out has been around for more than a century! When I heard Hedges perform ""Because It's There,"" I was stunned by the beauty of this instrument's sound.Years later, I picked up a copy of BEYOND SIX STRINGS which was produced by Stephen Bennett and Gregg Miner. This was a collection of various artists displaying their technique with this amazing instrument.Bennett's contribution to that album, ""November,"" is also included here. First released in 2004 as a 2-CD set, HARP GUITAR - A COMPILATION collects 29 tunes from previous releases by Bennett on the Cimirron/Rainbird label between 1992 and 2004. Each of these solo pieces is a complete joy and (at the price!) an economical way to introduce yourself to one of the principal practioners of the harp guitar. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Greated product,I have connected to an Iogear Video splitter with other 50 ft cableand work very well. Good resolution transmition.
3,"Good Chips, Bad Case","The chips are great but the case they came with does not shut when they are inside. So the case is useless to me. Also, I got two missed blind chips instead of a big blind chip."
5,THE BEST POKER CHIPSET EVER,"This set was beyond fantastic. These chips could sell for a lot more than I bought them for, and with all the extras that were included, I became the envy of every player in my town!"
4,"Good Product, Poor Customer Service","I received the chips in a timely manner, however the case was dented. I emailed the company regarding this and never received a response. I would not order from a company that ignores its customers once the items are shipped."
2,Poor,Was disappointed with the box. Same color chips don't fit in one column. So you have to break the bundle and do an odd distribution. The box hood keeps on falling on your hand when you are taking out the chips.Very less number of green chips and not many blacks
3,case does not stay open on its own,"Nice chips and case, but case does not stay open on its own. Need a stick or your forehead to hold top of case while get chips."
4,High tech tennis,This book was great but tended to over do some points. I liked the little tips that were given on various pages. The only thing that i could see wrong overall with this book was that it is a bit old but the science of it has'nt changed its just that technology has.
2,No clear target,"Beginners, intermediate and advanced players need different types of information. The problem with this book is that it does not seem to address any specific level or make distinctions about what is suitable for different skill levels. To the author we all seem to be ""athletes"". Very basic information apt for an absolute beginner (how to hit a slice backhand) is mixed with advice for more advanced players (top spin lob, top spin/side spin serves are all described as fairly easy). I felt that some basic information was missing. For instance there was very little discussion of grips, and the little there was I found confusing. Further, the technical discussion about rackets and strings, although interesting, is today clearly outdated. You will not find discussions on new ultra-light Titanium rackets, and how they can affect the type of tennis you play (shorter swings?). In all fairness super stiff Titanium racket came to the market years after the book was published."
1,leaks,"Started leaking when first used hung on the wall. The one I am replacing leaked less. Lot of plastic, afraid if used very much it would break."
3,Comparison to previous but now discontinued Ames reel,"Buying experience from Amazon was seamless. Really liked reel that I had before,but is now discontinued. Tried to get replacement part but with no luck. Too bad, but I will have to live with it for now. Old reel was better constructed, even though assembly recquired, a much more sturdy unit.Ames True Temper 2388700 Hose King Hose Reel"
1,"""Reel crappy"" is more like it!","I bought this today at my local hardware outlet... and three frustrating hours later, returned it... Here are my pro's and con's:Pros:* Nice color, blends into any house or garden* Inexpensive* Doesn't cause skin irritation, vomiting or hives (ok, that's a stretch, but I couldn't think of a third pro and I wanted three)Cons:* Flimsy plastic, cheaply made* Connector to water supply line is plastic, not brass, and despite much tightening, mine dripped and dripped.* Does NOT hold a 100 foot 5/8"" hose. Not even close.I'm going to order a metal ""professional"" model on Amazon that's about 3x the price of this...but reviews are very positive and it looks like it will last. This thing will NOT last."
3,Better than Suncast,"This would be a 4 star product except for two issues.1. The inlet (leader) line supplied that goes from your faucet to the reel is very poor quality. My first reel leaked twice here until I replaced the inlet hose with an old piece of better quality hose. At one location I needed a longer leader anyway, so replaced it immediately.2. The instructions say to mount this with the hose guide going down as shown in the picture. This really needs to be mounted with the guide going horizontal so you can pull the hose out and roll it back in easily.With that said I still bought another one of these instead of the less expensive Suncast. The Suncast had bad reviews for cheap plastic parts. I think this one is better and has performed well after fixing the inlet hose and changing the mounting orientation."
4,"Great product works nicely, helps with clutter","I had a cart hose reel in the garage which took up too much space. I found this type of hose reel that is installed flat on the wall. Installation was pretty simple. I like how it looks on the wall and how it frees up a lot of space. This thing works nicely, only a few problems with dripping water occasionally, but every hose reel I owned has done this. I'm not sure how this plastic would hold up in full sunlight. But, for my case, in the garage, i can see it lasting many years"
1,Just another cheap plastic hose reel that will leak,"I suppose if you only have 25' of low end garden hose (light weight) it might hold up.BUT, for a normal 75' run of good quality hose, forget it. It will leak and I mean big time.It's only supported on one end of the reel which is 50% of the problem. Add that to the fact it is plastic and you have a poorly desugned product."
2,Les from Amazon,"The reel will hold 100 feet of 3/4 inch garden hose, but revinding and pulling the hose out is a challenge. The hose guide at the bottom of the reel acts like a brake. It would be better not to have this guide, or it should have rollers for allowing the hose to slip through. The O-rings did not seal well because imperfections at the molded O-ring seats. Otherwise the reel looks REEL good on the wall..."
2,Not impressed so far,"I read wonderful reviews about shea butter and decided to give it a try. I have to admit, my expectations were high.The first night I put it on my face and body I was quite disgusted by how greasy it is. It is indeed like spreading butter all over yourself. And it doesn't absorb either. It just stays on your body all greasy and shiny. This feeling is really gross so I really just have to make myself not think about it. The smell is also quite unpleasant and everybody who smelled it so far think so as well. The smell follows you around so if you put the stuff on your body during the day you need to realize that people may not like the way you smell.I've been using it for a week now and have to say that I haven't noticed much difference from any other lotion I've ever used. Except that this one just feels like I'm spreading butter over my body.I'll give it a week or two more, maybe finish the jar - but my expectations are now very low."
4,not for heavy duty jobs,Although this comes with scrappers and other attachment this heat gun is far from being heavy duty. I bought this to apply heat shrink to electric wiring on my motorcycle and it does a great job. If you are look for something to remove paint I don't think this gets hot enough to do a good job on paint.
4,Seems great!,I've had this product for about a week now and I'm very happy happy with it.I bought it mainly because it is much cheaper than comparable products from B&D; or Dremel and it hasn't let me down. Works great for stripping paint and using heatshrink on computer power supply cables.
1,Cheap build and non performing,"This heat gun failed to help me remove a thick layer of plasticized paint.The unit is built very cheaply, and the so called accessories look more like toys, than tools: made up of very thin tin.I would not buy this product again."
4,Good Tool for home use,"The Hot Air Gun was lightweight, and did not feel uncomfortable. I had no issues with the gun shutting off due to overheating, and I had it running on the highest setting for several minutes. Make sure you plug it in to a outlet that is not very busy.All in all it was a good purchase, and hope to get more use out of it this summer."
5,Does the Job!,"I bought the HomeRight heat gun based on another customer's very detailed review.Quality was surprisingly good for the price, and it came with attachments and a sturdy plastic carrying case.The variable heat control settings, not found at this price range, really make the HomeRight heat gun versatile.I've already reshaped a slightly dented rear plastic bumper on my SUV, saving myself a $1000 body repair job, and have done a few projects requiring heat shrink tubing.Great deal for the price!"
5,"How to improve on perfection? I dunno, but they did it.","I first found Maktub shortly after the release of their first CD, Subtle Ways, and fell instantly in love with this band. I'd already owned Kronos [pre their Velour signing] when they were 'introduced' on NPR earlier this year.When I slid Kronos in the tray, I instantly felt like I had with Subtle Ways. Here's a band that really understands music, knows how to play it and craft songs that don't sound like everyone else's. The arrangements are complex without being avant-garde; the percussion isn't just average beat-keeping. Kronos was even better lyrically until...Hooray that Velour has decided to release this CD without the one objectional song that belonged on a Godsmack release, not with the rest of these wonderful tunes. Now it really is a collection that can be put in the player, listened to from start to finish, and one mo' 'gin!"
4,Modern Funk/Soul Throwback,"Maktub's 'Khronos' lays down some great tracks, and is certainly more than just a one-hit album that other reviewers complain about. Yes, there is little doubt the catchiest song on this disc is the first one (""You Can't Hide""), but ""See Clearly"" is equally nice, and ""So Tired,"" ""Give Me Some Time,"" and ""Just Like Murder"" deliver as well. Zepplin fans may or may not like Maktub's version of ""No Quarter"" (I'm ambivalent to it), but on all tracks singer Reggie Watt's smooth voice and the band's funky sound delivers music reminiscent of Earth, Wind and Fire. This is a good, solid selection."
5,"very good book, but has some dangers","On the volley, Braden advocates having a forehand grip and a backhand grip. Not having a single volley grip has some advantages, but is a very distinct minority view.On the forehand groundstroke, Braden advocates the Eastern grip, but nowadays this appears to be a slightly minority view. Most good players use a Semi-Western grip or at least a grip that is at least slightly to the West of an Eastern grip.But again, this is a very valuable book."
2,Not worth the money,"Not well made, the foam seat came apart and the cover was very thin cotton. The elastic was to small to attach to the seat. After a month I threw it in the trash."
5,seat cushion,This was perfect for what I wanted it for. I needed a little extra lift in my car. This gave me that.
4,Auto seat wedge,My step-daughter is very short and has a difficult time looking out the windsheild of the car. This cushion has aided her in seeing better when driving.
5,WOW!,I collect these records for years and have never seen a CD so good. Sound is excellent and package is beautiful. Perfect transfers. Recommend to everyone!
3,Excellent transfers; questionable musical value,"I was delighted to get this excellent set of transfers from Archeophone. The hit of the week holds a special place in the hearts of collectors of early 1930's music. They sound great and Archeophone is turning into a major player in remastering and ancient recordings. The problem is that these are not essential performances. The orchestrations lack inventiveness or anything of interest (except for the circumstances of the hotw series) in many cases and my reaction to many of these was, ""ho hum."" If it wasn't for the unique cultural history of these recordings, I doubt that I would have sprung for this collection. There are enough good songs and performances here but plenty of drab ones, also. I will get volume 2 since I collect this type of music, but I am not expecting much. The hits of the week may not have had what it takes to be hits of the century."
5,PRETTY & DAINTY,"These are a great buy! They are average size turquoise studs that in other stores would cost a whole lot more. They are a great match to turquoise bead necklace I have had for over a year now. (I was looking for just a matching stud.) And, they have a 14kt. post."
4,Sunny Californian,"The earrings are as described, vivid in color and a nice size. The only negative to report is the backs are very flimsy and I replace them as I almost lost one earring the first time I wore them. Otherwise, I highly recommend them, I have received many compliments on them."
5,Stadium Replica,"This item is beyond any words. It is a fantastic replica of the stadium. A truly ""Gold Series"" limited edition of FedEx Field. The minute details are awesome. My son-in-law saw the stadium and had wished we had purchased it for him. I think we will look for something for him for his birthday. He doesn't want this particular stadium, but I think a college one. We'll be looking soon. We all enjoy shopping through Amazon. You all are GREAT to work with. An ""A-plus"" organization, for sure. You all are a ""Gold Series!""Thanks again, BobbiNFL 4750 Limited Edition Gold Series Stadium Replica of M&T; Bank Stadium Baltimore RavensNFL 4750 Limited Edition Gold Series Stadium Replica of Veterans Stadium Former Philadelphia EaglesNCAA 4750 Limited Edition Platinum Series Stadium Replica of Oklahoma Memorial Stadium Sooners"
3,Alittle Confusing,"I am very new to quilting, so this book was confusing to me. It starts out being easy to read then half way thru a part it gets bogged down by trying to be more technical than it needs to be. So this book would be probably understood by more advanced Quilters. I found the book ""Quilting For Dummies"" much more informative, just as technical, and alot more easier to read and understand."
5,Easy to follow visual direction,"This is my second purchase of this book. The first for myself I found this book so useful that I purchase a second for my sister B-day. This is a must have for new quilters. this is has easy to follow information and covers alot of how to do information. If you are looking for alot of quilt patterns this is not the book. But if you are wanting to know how to do the patterns,rotory cutting,sewing,planning and putting it all together this is it. Lots of helpful hints."
5,Excellent,"What this book does not have is not worth knowing! Bought for DIL, will be borrowing it often! Fantastic book."
2,I don't like it.,The subject matter was scattered and not coesive to the information being sought. The information did not provide me the quilting details I was led to believe it had.
3,Complete Guide to Quilting (Better Homes and Garden Collection),I have been more than satisfied with ever book that I have ordered from Amazion.com
5,Lovely book!,Nice picture guidlines help so much with understanding exactly what we are supposed to be doing. Great help for anyonewho is new to quilting. Clear instructions are so helpful!
5,Really helpful.,I like this book because I can look up how to do things without having to track somebody down to ask. Very easy to understand.
1,SHAMEFUL!,"I bought this book thinking that it would give me an unbiased perspective on Muslim life in America. Instead, what I got was a very ethnocentric, biased, bogus book that promotes leading (misleading) Muslims into the Christian faith. I was dismayed at the dreadfully biased mis-information given. Unfortunately for these authors, I knew more about Islam than they gave me credit for. They are obviously banking on selling this book to those who have no background in Islam, because this book would not hold up to any educated scrutiny. Shameful!"
1,"Empty, not working, right out of the box.","I installed this in my printer after I blew off the dust off the box. It either dried up or was empty from the start. I don't know if they are selling refills or what but I'm super bummed I spent this money on Ink and now I'm printing blank pages. I haven't installed the color cartridge from the same order but if its anything like this one, I'm gonna be pretty upset I wasted my money and now have to go to a store and buy another.will never again.AJ"
1,Didn't even print 20 pages!,"I don't print very often and honestly I probably have not print over 20 pages in the 4 months since I installed this refilled ink cartridge. Last night I tried to print and nothing prints that is black (black is the cartridge that I ordered). My color cartridge (genuine HP about 3 yeas old) still prints, LOL!I feel it doesn't matter how low the price is, if I'd known your product would only be good for a few pages I would not have ordered it.Very disappointed!"
1,Error: Wrong Ink for Printer,I have ordered this product previously and had no real issue up until this point. My printer does not recognize the ink as the correct type for my printer even though I am certain it is the correct ink. I have had one occassion where the printer does not recognize the ink as genuine HP product but I reinserted and it seems to work. The packaging and authencity seems appropriate but something is not right. Maybe best to pay a few dollars more and taxes and get it from the B&M retailer?
4,0728shadrack,"I have bought this item several times before and have had good luck with them. You get much more as far as the amount of ink is concerned. If you do much printing or copying, the regular cartridges don't last very long. I've never had any problem with this cartridge at all. Completely satisfied. Its also cheaper in the long run."
5,updated review,"The vendor of this item provides solid customer service, is honorable and stands behind their work. They are replacing what was simply a faulty ink cartridge at no cost. The gentlemen was very happy to provide integrity and solid business practice in corrected the problem right away. It is a breath of fresh air to find such excellent customer service, product & business integrity. My previous review is thoroughly amended here. I thoroughly recommend purchasing products from this business."
5,Best Place On Earth To Buy Ink Cartridges,I can't find a better way to purchase my new cartridges for my HP printer. I can't get over how fast delivery was 1 or 2 days! Can't beat that. I don't like using refilled cartridges and the price on this is about the same price. Great to find this here on Amazon.
5,Excellent service,I was very pleased with the quick service and high quality of the HP High Yield ink cartridges. I definitely recommend this vendor.
1,Incompatible with J6480,"I have an HP J6480, which takes the HP74 ink.This cartridge worked a few times with it and then quit.I get the message ""Cartridge Error: Cartridge on right must be replaced.""I called HP support and they couldn't help me. They offered to replace the cartridge, but then said they couldn't because I bought it on Amazon.Also: it's impossible to even use the scanner as long as that error is on, so just avoid this cartridge if you have the HPJ6480"
3,OK--Not a great value anywhere; better on Amazon,"HP ink is really overpriced. This is a bit better than most prices--and it was free shipping so I didn't have to go out and hunt for them. PDFs are saving us a lot of money. Again, Amazon did a good job on the relative price v. other retailers, delivery, and the rest of it. The product itself is the issue as a captive user, never a great pleasure."
5,Excellent deal,"This was an excellent option, hands down, one of the best deals that you can buy for a ""NEW"" ink cartridge. My wife, who happens to be a school teacher, usually prints off 20 - 30 pages a day and I will print anywhere from 10 - 15 pages. Amazon's price compared to Staples, Best Buy or even Wal-Mart is the lowest. Definitely a hot buy!!"
3,HP Inkjet Cartridge,"Good product, decent price. I don't think you'll find it any cheaper anywhere else."
1,Do not waste your money,Terrible purchase! Product worked for one week and ran out of ink... DO NOT PURCHASE!!!
5,Just as expected,This print cartridge will fit any HP printer that accepts the regular 74. I put it in my C4240 and it works perfectly. I spend less time and money changing cartridges.
3,Doesn't Last That Much Longer,"I thought I would try the 74XL for my HP OfficeJet J6480 All in One for longer print cartridge life. I read somewhere that the XL might provide up to 750 pages of copies (depending of course on the print settings).I got less than 500 copies on my last cartridge, set to fast draft quality, which is a lot less than I expected. Not as economical as the hype would lead you to believe. I will probably try another XL to see what happens, but my feeling is that it might be a bit overrated, at least from my experience."
5,"Genuine, perfect.","Installation went smoothly. This is the genuine product, comes in retail packaging.My printer recognized the cartridge instantly and there were no problems whatsoever!"
1,Not an HP product,Product description gave the impression that this was a remanufactured HP OEM brand cartridge. It is not. This is just an off-brand rip-off. BEWARE picture and description is deceptive!!!
1,quality is extremely poor,"bought 2 of these thinking it was a very good deal... the first cartridge became inoperable after approximately 10 single page copies of invoices were made... put the second one in and have made 6 printed pages so far... based on the poor performance of the first one, I would not recommend these to anyone... the second one just failed after making just 45 single pages of printed invoices... very, very poor product"
4,Good Things to buy in Good Price,This is a very good item in great price.But it is not the same size as my Original Ink Cartridge. And Quality of printing little bit light as compared to Original Ink Cartridge.I recommended to buy this item.
5,Great price and service!,This was the best price I found anywhere. The ink cartridges were just as described and in perfect new condition! I would happily buy from them again.
1,Cartridge arrived broken.,"I tried to put the cartridge in the printer 5 times and the printer rejects it. I did some research online and found out that perhaps the chip is broken. Anyway, money wasted."
5,HP 74XL Black Inkjet Cartridge,"The item was delivered in good time. I have not yet used the ink cartridge, so cannot comment on it's quality at this time."
3,Nice Product,The product is great but gave it a 3 as I found the same ink in generic for much less at a local office supply store.
3,"HP 64XL Cartridge, Black",Cartridges were not as good as ones we have had before for printing photos. Dark colors came out looking as though they were in lighter and darker bars.
2,Not exactly as advertised . . .,"Maybe I missed something, but I thought I was purchasing a new cartridge. When I received it, the expiration was from 2009 (3 years ago) with ink stains on the label and printed with lines going across the page. After a few more printouts, the text was a little better but I wasn't sure how long that would last. Had this been advertised as a remanufactured cartridge, I would not have purchased it. I gave 2 stars because the seller responded quickly and I received my refund in a timely manner."
1,Deceptive ad,"HP 74XL Ink Cartridge, BlackMy Photosmart 4345 does not recognize this as an HP cartridge, which is what the packaging in the Amazon listing (""HP 74XL Black Ink Cartridge in Retail Packaging"" sold by Linkyo Express) claims it to be. It arrived in an unmarked pouch with no box: I realized that might mean trouble but couldn't try it out right away. Now that I have installed it, I find that it works only when I specify ""best copy."" Otherwise it prints only the top half of of the page with too little ink on the bottom half to be even legible. I consider this a deceptive ad as I expected an original HP cartridge. My advice, in view also of the others who have had this or a related problem: do not even consider buying this product from this seller."
3,"no ""retail packaging""","I purposely paid a couple dollars extra to get a ""retail packaged"" cartridge in a box as shown in the photo for this item. I received a cartridge in plastic pouch with no box. It was mailed in a bubble wrap envelope. The cartridge works OK, and my printer recognized it as a genuine HP cartridge."
3,HP ink doesn't have to be a rip-off,Appears to be the real deal but I have 1 concern.... The exterior box (with the expire date on it) was removed by the seller. I'll see if they work tomorrow.
3,Not Very Happy With HP Products,This product functions fine. The gripe that I have is that is has doubled in price since I purchased this one. The price for this ink cartridge is now almost as much as I originally paid for the printer. I am considering purchasing a different brand of printer soon. Remanufactured cartridges to not perform with my HP printer. Also Hp no longer makes a printer that will print directly to a CD/DVD & that was the main reason I bought my HP C5580 in the first place. Cannon makes a printer that is reasonably priced & has the print to CD/DVD feature & that will be my next purchase. Also have an HP computer that has given me lots of trouble. Will buy a different brand next time.
1,Paid premium for a re-manufactured and defective ink cartridge,"The product was not what you would buy at the stores. It looked like a refilled cartridge with ink stains on the label that probably was made by the mishandling of whomever refilled it. It worked on my printer at first, but the ink had a very strong chemical-like smell to it. After a month or so and only using 1/4 of the cartridge ink, it all of a sudden wasn't compatible with my printer. I did all troubleshooting options, but it would not comply. I have been shopping at Amazon.com for many years, and this has got to be the worst experience that I have had. I should not have to waste time to complain about a $20+ product, but I am doing it out of principle. Amazon should screen these sellers before working with them."
1,Received Re-manufactured Cartridge instead of New,"I ordered what was represented to be a (New) HP74XL Ink Cartridge but upon opening the ink cartridge package it showed to be a (Re-manufactured Cartridge). I will no longer buy Ink Cartridges from Amazon.comHP 74XL Ink Cartridge, Black."
5,Great!,"Bought this one year ago and still haven't replaced it yet. Works great, never had any problems. What a huge cost saver! I will buy this again and again as long as I have this printer."
1,Ordering problem,"I was unpleasantly suprised to find that the two items ordered has to come from different suppliers. This of course requires double shipping charges. One would think that the 74xl and 75xl ink cartridges, which go together much like salt and pepper, would be available from the same supplier? Live and learn, I guess! I am taking this review system as my only option (other than the phone) to vent my dissatisfaction. I looked for a way to use E-mail, but can't seem to find such an option."
2,You don't deliver this item,"I am very disappointed because you cannot deliver this product, arguing incorrect address. But you do deliver the printer to the same address, without any problem.I need the print cartridge too !!!"
4,Great Band in a No Music Town,"I just caught ""The John Sparrow"" live at a local club in Houston and they were really good. There sound is somewhere between The Everyothers and The Blank Stares. These are both New York bands, which is where I think The John Sparrow belongs. There sound is way too good to go to waste here in Houston. Buy this album, you wont regret it."
4,Doesn't quite work,"I've heard U.S. Highball live a few times, done wonderfully (once at St Anne's in Brooklyn Heights, I believe), and have the Gate 5 Ensemble with Thomas Coleman rendition on CRi Harry Partch Collection Vol. 2, also done wonderfully. The Kronos Quartet & David Barron rendition doesn't quite work, I'm afraid, though it's a noble try. Firstly, this is a stripped down version from the ones I've heard, which have multiple voices. That reduction tones down the richness and drama. Secondly, the ""dirtiness"" of the Partch-scale isn't there. And the droll character of the music isn't apparent. 3rdly, Mr Barron's voice, too, is too clean for my tastes, though he does try nobly to fit the mood.The transcription is played admirably by the Quartet. The overall attempt is very much appreciated."
5,Harry Partch CD US Highball Kronos Quartet,"The whole deal was top notch. Price, speed and quality. Could not have asked for more. Very, very pleased."
5,My Fav CD now,"I have listened to this SACD several times in 2 days now, and it is my favorite now. On the Sony PS3, this SACD shows up as either a 2 channel or 8 channel from the XMB->Music->CD menu. I never listened to the 2 channel version, but listening the 8 channel version on my 7.1 Yamaha receiver just puts right there."
5,Awesome Transfer,"Judging by the liner notes, this was one of the first albums to be made in quadrophonic sound. I never heard that version, but I have to admit, this version is pretty awesome. This was recorded in a church with four organs. You can hear the different organs in each of the speakers and if you close your eyes, you can almost imagine that you are in a magnificent cathedral in Germany somewhere. The crispness and clarity of SACD comes out and the warmth of the organs comes out very well. I hope that this format sticks around because I am getting more and more impressed with it as I listen to new CDs of it."
5,Best SA-CD I own,"If your AV system is capable of taking advantage of SA-CD then you OWE it to yourself to purchase this disc - the sound is just that amazing. Many have said this before me, but this is a recording of four organs being played at once in a large church, and you can hear EVERYTHING. Every note is super clear. You can hear the echo when the organ releases every note. You can even hear the organ changing ranks when the organist changes stops. If you close your eyes it seriously feels like you are in a large church listening to four organs which are 100 feet away.In short, if you have ears that work, and an A/V system capable of playing SA-CD (this will not work in a normal CD player) then you will appreciate this and you must own it."
1,First printing riddled with errors,"The first printing is riddled with errors. Freeman have published on their Web site 10 pages of errata, but I have found yet another error. I am left wondering how many errors remain, even in the newer, corrected, printing.The examples are often worked with such abridgment that the student is left staring across either conceptual or algebraic chasms.Too much page space is burned on problems, and not enough on exposition.My perennial pet peeve for modern textbooks: the coated paper makes the book too heavy. I had to rip it into individual chapters to make it tolerable. And, of course, it is too expensive."
3,Bacon,"It arrived cold and fresh in Ca. It was derinded so it was easiy to cut. It cooked well and smelled wonderful. But, It was 20% too salty for my taste. The bacon was edible and was a good component for dishes,but so salty I couldn't eat more than 1 piece at a sitting. I will not order this brand again."
2,Terrible remastering,The performance is sublime...but the remastering lets you hear odd sounds during the performance...like when the foot pedals are actuated. Very disconcerting!
5,Mandatory reading,"This book is a MUST read for every woman and teenager - it should be mandatory reading for all teens. Such helpful insight into a dark world. It also provides so much information about the formation of vulnerability even into early childhood. Read it, read it, read it. SHARE it! Help stop the abuse before it starts."
3,can't buy can't get,"For a long time I was looking for a specific song and I could not find it anywhere,one of those songs that have an IT.slightly different from your normal R&B with a bit of mid tempo.i have found that song in this CD.Track 13,a golden oldie with a long shelf life,I hear those older than me complaining whenevr I play ""love don't feel like love no more "" by C.L.Blast....well it is one of those moments that you have to buy the whole album just for that one track.....the rest of the song are not bad to the ear.....sipho (south africa)"
4,A good and fast read,I like her booksBeing a fan I always get her new books and look forward to them coming out
2,Good book,My only disappointment reading this book was to discover partway through it (Kindle edition where you're not always aware of how many pages are left) that the story ended and a new one started! Both stories were very good though.
3,Two for one Romance,I enjoyed the first story the most. It had an edge of anticipation throughout the story. The second story did not maintain my interest and I kept wondering how many more pages to go. It was all to predictable. Since I enjoyed one and not the other as much therefore the three stars.
5,Sweet Christmas story,I loved this Heart warming Christmas story and would have adopted one of the puppies had this been in real life.
5,Loved It,I don't think Debbie Macomber can write a book I wouldn't like! She has such a wonderful sense of humor and love.
4,One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorites episodes. It provides a excellant study of study of patriotic extremes and excesses and greed.As an American though, I must admit that the scene where Kirk looks back at the ragged flag as they're getting ready to leave the planet brings a tear to my eye and a lump to my throat. Those from other countries may not feel these way, but it's still an excellant episode."
1,Another Earth Parallel Story!,"I really liked the beginning of this episode. The idea that an entire crew had been completely dehydrated was very cool. But what do we get later? American propaganda shoved down our throats. William Shatner was pretty funny when he read the preamble to the United States, I mean Omega IV, Constitution. The Second Season really overdid it on earth parallel stories."
3,Its Techno!,"For the knowledge of other Star Wars fans who may want to buy this CD, it is a techno remix album of the Imperial March by John Williams. This is not the <Special Edition> single featured in the booklet from the Max Rebo Band or Figrin D'an singles also available from the <special edition>."
3,Better then the Fifa200 - BUT!,"Fifa series are going down (I mean the level) very fast this time! I had Fifa99 it was a good game for me, but I thought I need a new DATA for the new players to know ""where"" there are.Unfortunately I had a shock because there was not so many new options that I thought. I have an advice to the EA-Sports: ""The people are not mad because the game is bad. They are mad because there ARE NOT SO MANY NEW OPTIONS as there was at the independence between the Fifa 98 and the 99!"""
1,FIFA 2000 is the worst soccer I've ever played,"I am sort of a sport games collector. I have played FIFA 2000 for a couple months, and I am extremely dissatisfied with FIFA 2000. First of all, it's because of the refree strictness (I set it to the centre of defined); I often recieve yellow or red cards when I use tackle (I don't use aggressive or hard tackle), and I am called offside even when the computer is passing the ball! Secondly, the goalie of my own team isn't moving at all! Every time when the ball is rolling towards the goalie, he just watches the incoming player kicking the ball into the net; the goalie doesn't do anything trying to save the ball! These problems are really serious. How could people call it a good soccer game? FIFA 2000 is the worst soccer game I've ever played. I feel FIFA 98 and FIFA 99 are way better than 2000, but I am truly disapppointed with FIFA 2000. For all of you who are reading this: This is not the game that you want to buy!"
3,OK THIS IS A COMPUTER GAME THEY HAVE PATCHS,"ok first off the game right out the box isn't the best i haveto admit its 2 fast, the speech is bad and i most say i cryed at thefact it cost me. Then i remembered why i bought the computer version Web sites fix all the problems from the Portuguse league to players that are messing. So buy it and fix it. EAsports was lazy because they know fans are to the level were they can fix their problems. Try r do a search thats all u have 2 do. LONG LIVE FOOTBALL END"
1,Fifa 2000 is a waste of time,"Come on, MLS? please. The American commentators are ANNOYING. They keep mentioning wrestling comments in a football game? Also there are many league playing problems. Where is the argentine league? I think it is far superior than the MLS. Come on easports, this game sucks."
2,Disappointed,"I was really anticipating the arrival of FIFA 2000. I thought it would improve on Fifa'99. Instead E.A sports went backwards. What's with the American commentators. They sound like their commentating a hockey game. Also, they added mediocre leagues such as Israel and Turkey and took out the Portugese league and other than Brazil, still have not added any of the South American leagues such as Argentina or Colombia. Futhermore, they don't allow you to play as more than 8 teams when creating a tournament. What's with that? Before you could choose to play as almost all the teams. This game really sucks compared to older FIFA games. (Bring back the British commentators, atleast it sounds like a soccer game)."
4,This works well when combined with the shampoo,"I used to swim on my high school swim team, and I remember using this product 30 years ago. I recently started swimming again and my hair was getting dry, so I searched for this and was surprised - but happy - that it is still around. It worked then and it works now. I find that if I use the shampoo alone, it's not as good as using the shampoo and then the conditioner. This seems to help get the chlorine out better than most other shampoos."
1,Nope! Not a keeper,"I purchased this software at the beginning with the understanding that ""updates"" and ""upgrades"" would be available...They were not and trying to complete a dissertation with this has been impossible. After 30 years of being a professional student and teacher I am very dissappointed in this software. I give this software a failing grade."
2,dissappointed,"I found reading this philisophical treatise masquerading as a cookbook that fat-free does NOT mean low calorie. This is the same drivel that agrabusiness does, make and label something as fat-free and then use such ingredients that the calorie count is as high or higher in some misguided attempt to retain the same 'flavor'. What a waste of money this was...and the recipes are more appropriate for some yuppie type, upper-class, european wannabe restaurant rather than a middle class palette...useless."
4,beautiful songs,"A welcome reissue in CD format from old LP's of Carpenters compositions : song cycles of very well known lyrics. Particularly fascinating are the renderings of poems from ""Gitanjali"", a collection of poems by Rabindranath Tagore in English translated from original Bengali; a work that got Nobel prize in 1913 (Not the Pullitzer prize as mentioned in th accompanying text). The songs on lyrics/poems by other poets, all americans are just as beautiful. Well done."
2,Violin,"I bought this violin for my daughter in December 2010. It worked well right out of the box.But, the tuning going off very frequently. When the strings tighten to tune the instrument are not staying which requires to tune every time that she wants to use. My kid's music teacher is not happy with the instrument as it is taking too much of her time to keep the instrument tuned. I want to see if the Seller can help me with fixing the issue."
1,Money wasted,"I bought this violin 9 months ago for my daughter and it turned out to be a disaster. After nearly 6 months, the bow had to be replaced because the hair completely fell out. Right from the beginning my daughter's teacher kept complaining that it doesn't hold on to the tune. But, when winter came, it became almost completely unusable. Finally, last week I took it to a violin shop. The pegs and tuners are made of real bad quality. The tuners were turning in the same position and the pegs were made of a material that can't withstand the cold. They said there is nothing you can do on it other than replace it which is what I have to do.Looking back, I should just have rented a violin for the amount I spent on buying this one. Even if it was not faulty, my daughter would have grown out of it in no time, which would have made it a worthless investment."
5,Toscanini's Wagner,"What is there about Toscanini? Everything he does sounds more emotional, more intense and exciting, and more beautiful than any other conductor's. His Wagner is no exception, and the remastering of the Immortal Toscanini series is just excellent. While I am not a Wagner expert, nor do I like all of the selections on this set, that's my reaction to Wagner, not Toscanini. This is just outstanding work, as good as his Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert, or any other of the composers he recorded.On this set, I especially like the Meistersinger prelude. I have heard this done by other conductors, such as Kempe who does a very fine job with it, but still Toscanini somehow manages to get the utmost emotion from the work, more evocative than anyone else.This is a two disc set that I will go back to again and again. Highest recommendation. The only mystery is why RCA/BMG decided to discontinue production, really hard to understand."
4,"a very good game, but with errors","I would say this game is rather good. The graphics are nice to look at, you can ride your own rides and stuff, however, i find that this game lacks the depth that one finds in Roller Coaster Tycoon. If you are having to find a choice between the 2, I reccomend you buy RCT, and it's expansion"
1,I can't get it to work!,"Okay, I absolutely loved the old sim theme park game, so I figured I'd treat myself to the new fancy-shmancy version. Yeah. right. This stupid game won't work on my computer! You need to have a CERTIFIED DRIVER to work it, and many computers (or at least of ppl i know) don't have this. It crashes my computer constantly, and I can't figure out how to make it compatible with my system. btw, any suggestions for this problem would be greatly appreciated! thanks!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Very Slow on 450 PIII with TNT, Annoying Interface, Hard to get past first park, Limited set of ride types, Stay with RCT"
1,"If Maxis would had done it, It would be much more better.","This game really has dull graphics, has major errors and the worst simulation game ever! When I first saw it, I was thrilled that another simulation game popped up. When I tried it, after one hour, I stopped playing it. Mainly because it had boring features. If you like roller coaster simulations, then buy RollerCoaster Tycoon! With it's new expansion packs, you'lle be a RollerCaoster Master in no time. So don't spend that money in your pocket for this one."
2,Please Don't Buy this!,"If you are looking for a roller coaster game, get Roller Coaster Tycoon, not this. I own both, and RCT is the only one I continue to play. First of all, you have to have a super computer to run this game. It crashed 2 computers before I found one it would work on. Even now, there are little lines all across the words in the game. Very annoying. The only thing a little great about this game is that you can ride the coasters you made, but it's really not as cool as it sounds. This game does not live up to the standards of previous Sim games at all! Now get out there and buy RCT!"
1,Really Bad!,"""Sim Theme Park"", or in Europa ""Theme Park World"" is a really bad game. ""RollercoasterTyccon"" + ""Added Attractions Pack"" must have 100 points comparing to ""Sim Theme Park"". I will always play RTC and never again ""Sim Theme Park"". If you plan to buy it, don't do it, buy RCT."
1,"Not Worth it, Get Roller Coaster Tycoon","I thought this game looked like it would be great-- but it turned out that it was boring, irritating, not to mention that it has bugs- my computer is almost brand new, and this game would crash every five minutes. A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon, and I became addicted to it- I LOVE it! If you are interested in this game, I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead, it's a lot more fun, and it doesn't have bugs- don't waste your money on Sim ThemePark!"
1,TWO THUMBS DOWN! WAY DOWN!,"Ok, get Rollercoaster Tycoon and STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS, nuff said."
5,The Best Game EVER!,This is a real good game compared to Roller Coaster Tycoon. The graphics are awesome! I don't see how you could like RCT better. The 3D part of it is great.
1,Good Offset By Bad,"Starting off, this game only has one feature that overcomes theme park titan ""roller coaster tycoon"" - the ability to ride your rides and stroll your park. Everything else, RCT dominates. In RCT you have more options, hundreds of rides and accessories, customize your own terrain, and it has many more than 4 themes (you can put as many themes as you want in your park. You can also buy land to expand your park.) don't settle for theme park, buy RCT and both expansions! it's worth the money!"
2,"Great expectations, greater disappointment!!","Sim ThemePark was not what I saw coming. Right when I got it, I popped it into the CD-Rom on the computer. I was so excited! But then, the downside comes along. The installation takes forever. I had to try again to make it work. Then, it takes forever just to get into the game. And when I finally got into the game, the colors were all screwed up. Okay, so I messed with some hardware on the computer, but even after my mom fixed it, they still wouldn't work right!! And whenever I go into the game, it gets stuck right after I click ""quit"". So I have to restart the computer completely. Since the day I first got this, this game has not seen the CD-Rom. At all. I am looking into Roller Coaster Tycoon, and am hoping that it will work much better than this. Thank you for reading my review!"
4,prety good but,i like it but its so bloody hard to get space zone. the parks are cool. one hint to people who buy it: some patterns in the rides and shops make some bloomin well needed moolah(as you americans say).
2,GEEZ I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"Sure it was fun for the first hour then it died. I could never get the kids to stop vandalism. Riding the rollercoasters weren't fun at all. You want a theme park game get Rollercoaster tycoon. Rollercoaster tycoon not Rollercoaster tycoon 2, but I won't get into that. Where can I get a refund....?"
3,Okay,"This game is good but I think they could do without the ant that pops up to tell you you are going bankrupt every 5 seconds. They should let you be in the park and not always an overhead view, go in the shops, and actually stand in line for rides."
1,Worst Game Ever,This is the Worst Game i ever bought the first time i bought it there was a problem with it and then the 2nd time its was still broken and had a problem with it don't waste ur money on it its so not worth it i still have the game but i've never been able to use it since its so messed up
3,Lame!!!!!,"Sim Theme Park is a bad copy of Rollercoaster Tycoon, which was way better than Sim Theme Park. I you buy it buy it USED."
1,Make sure you listen to others and I,BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY listen to me! I being a Maxis fan and liking Rollercoaster Tycoon really wanted this game.It is a horrible game. Possibly one of Maxis's worst games. It is very slow if you have a computer like mine(not sure what are the megs of ram etc.). Also like everyone else says it looks very cartoonish. I suggest you save your money and are very interested in buying a rollercoaster game buy Roller Coaster Tycoon or if you want to buy a Maxis game buy the Sim's or something like that. once again DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
4,"A game for lighthearted, but not so easy fun","A fun game where you learn to place everything in stratigec places, but you lose money really fast and cant build the ideal theme park due to lack of roller coasters"
2,I agree - Windows XP kills it!,"I am a software engineer by trade and while I agree that there are many variables at play with a 3D graphics game, the fact remains that it is the software company's responsibility to keep up with and comply to the different Windows and hardware platforms now available. My company does it, and any good game company will also, instead of pawning the blame on the hardware devices like EA does. The game was fun on Me, fun enough that my son was extremely disheartened when it crashed repeatedly to the desktop on XP. If you have XP, avoid it like the plague."
1,Windows XP Users Beware!,"I had wanted a sim amusement park game, and was given this for Christmas. Unfortunately, my husband had recently installed Windows XP. If you go to the EA website they will tell you that this game is NOT compatible with XP. It does NOT say that on the box. Even with all the patches available, the game has many problems, (can't save my games, incorrectly counts how many tickets I've earned, and freezes up on me EVERY time.) There are so many fun sim games out there - try a different one!"
2,Find a demo before you Buy!,"I was really excited when this first came out and could not wait to get it. ONce it arrived, I was pretty disappointed and frankly, was surprised that it came from the same people as SimCity!The game is slow and choppy. You can only start in one of two ""parks"" before going on. I tried, really tried to like it but have not touched it since.Try to find someone who has it or a demo to see and play before you pay the price."
1,Buy Roller Coaster Tycoon instead,Ive tried both Roller Coaster Tycoon and STP - Plus I am a great fan of real roller coasters. This game is OK but it just isn't nearly as good as RTC. Very slow and interface is messed up. Graphics are lousy.
3,Not a substitute for a roller coaster ride,"If you're buying this program with the idea of building a roller coaster and then getting to experience it, you will be very disappointed in the graphics in the ""try-out"" section of the program. If, on the other hand, you want to try to create another type of Sim City, you'll like it."
2,"Alright, not the best Maxis game out there...","I guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment. I probably would have liked it more if I hadn't already bought Rollercoaster Tycoon (even though I'm not really a fan of that game, it's a LOT better than Sim Theme Park). I felt ripped off when I found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from, which made this a very short lasting game. Another major problem is - you can even build your own rides! Talk about cheap.Overall I give Sim Theme Park 2 stars, I gave the extra star because I probably would have liked it more if I got it before I got Rollercoaster Tycoon. Actually, this game is pretty good for all ages, it's just leaning a little more towards the younger kids, about I guess 6-12. If you want a game for older gamers, try Rollercoaster Tycoon. (I suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like The Sims or somehting)."
4,A pretty good game,"If you like the sim games(city,sims,ect.)then this game is for you. it allows you to biuld your own theme park, hire staff, and make new rides."
2,Its not worth the money,"Sure, its fun its exciting, for about 5 minutes. You get bored of it fast, not to mention the fact that it crashes 4 out of 5 computers (not fact). If you want a good simFUN (my word) game get Roller-Coaster Tycoon. This game is fun for a while but it gets old quick and i say its a very dissapointing Sim game."
5,Sim theme park,"it is the best game i have ever been on i played it at my friends and now i want a copy of it, it is absolutely mint, class whatever you want to call it but it is my favorite game ever!!"
1,ummmm....,This game is stupid. It allways freezes my coputer and i have to turn off the computer and start it up again. I wouldnt recomend this game. You allways run out of money unless you dont build a lot of rides but if you dont build a lot of rides you dont get any customers. i would rate it lower then 1 star if i could.
4,This is a great game,"This game is really good for children with active minds, and adults alike. This game is very involving, and adds a fun twist to the traditional Sim City game."
2,Not XP Compatible,"This program will not even run in XP within the Win98/Me Compatibility feature provided by Microsoft.... and the web site is worthless.Runs very well in my Win98 machine, and my 11 yr daughter enjoys it better than RollerCoaster Tycoon."
2,BORING!!!,"When I first got this game for my birthday, I was so excited. I opened the box and found out it was the gold version. I raced to the computer and downloaded it right away. For the first couple of hours it worked great, but in the next couple of days it started slowing down and acted like it had bugs in it. Then it made it hard to go from one end of your parks to the other cuz it was really slow getting there. I hate that there are only 4 themes but all of them have the same rides with different looks. I was really disappointed. Right now I can't even get to the 4th theme cuz I can't earn that 5th stupid golden key because my park is not perfect enough. The ""helper"" is annoying and slows down game play. If you want a game that will really agitate you then this game is for you. If not, I would reccommend Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims. I gave this game 2 stars cuz it is pretty fun for the first couple of hours but then it gets really old and annoying after a while."
2,"A great game, but poor programing","I tried to play the game. It was starting to get good, exept the game crashed. I was very disapointed in the programming of the game and how the creators created it, to not being the best game ever. Beileive me. The game is good, but has very bad programming. Save your money, and buy Rollar Coaster Tycoon or maybe even SIM coaster."
1,GRRR,"I found this game to be incredibly dull and boring, that is after it actually worked. Back when I got this game ( about 6 months ago ) I had a 500mhz computer with a Voodoo graphics accelerator but this game doesnt work. I tried it on 2 computers and it hardly worked, i have no idea why this is but it would crash and shut down and take FOREVER to load. After waiting 15-20 minutes for it to load, I finally started playing it, expecting it to be excellant...it wasn't. The graphics are ok, but they look like a cartoon! You think would be cool to ride the rides but it isnt, it looks stupid. You can hardly make any choices, maxis made them all for you. You can't just choose a place and start building you have to follow along with the little story. My advice: If you really want a good Maxis game, get the Sims! It is addictive ( but gets old after a few months ) but thats another story."
1,The game sucked it won't even work it's a lousy game,I don't recommend any one to get this game. I try to play it and it wouldn't even download to my computer
4,So much fun for the creative mind!,"You could spend hours creating your own amusement park! It was so much fun. It helps you to see what's needed, how happy customers are and you can even ride your own ride! The first night I got it, I didn't sleep at all!Nice bright colors! Cute graphics."
1,Alway Quits!,This game would be a great game if it didn't quit all the time. I only played the action simulation game (like a demo) and thought it was a good game. I tryed to play a full simulatoin game and the game quits. I restarted the computer and restarted the game. I didnt even get the game fully loaded before it quit again. I had to reinstall the game to play action simulation. I tryed full simulation game but again the game quit. I woudn'y recomend you buy this game. It is only a waste of money.
2,Nice Try,"It was cool, funny and entertaining for a day or two. But then I realized that there no difference between the parks, and after a certain point there is no reason for expansion. The rides are all the same and there is little imagination used. The coustomers who continually throw-up are annoying."
4,Good Game,"Sim Them Park is a good game. One of the games largest advantages over the roller coaster tycoon series is the game's simplicity in roller coaster building and it's level of detail with shops.My main problem was it's shortage of golden tickets, items that you win by achieving certain goals,which are unknown to you. The golden tickets are used to purchase secret rides which can only be bought with the tickets. The ticket problem can be easily solved though, all you have to do is to ration out the tickets and only use them on the good rides. But, in order to know which ride is good, you have buy the strategy guide, which can also tell you what the goals are in each area. So, if you only buy the good secret rides and don't buy the bad ones, you ought to have enough tickets. I reccomend this game to everyone."
2,Don't waste your money on this game,"This game is frustrating, not intuitive and very boring after just a short time playing it. I learn programs and games very quickly, and I still cannot figure out how to rotate rides (I'm not sure you can!). Plus, it does not run on my new operating system, Windows XP.There are not that many rides to choose from, the graphics are distorted, the staff is useless (janitors will just stand around even when there is stuff to do right in front of them--no matter how much training you give them), the monetary system is bizarre, and that ant guy makes you crazy.If you want a good theme park simulation game, buy Rollercoaster Tycoon I or II. These are excellent games with more realistic graphics and more intuitive gameplay. You'll never get tired of them. Zoo Tycoon is not a themepark, but is another excellent simulation game.Sim Theme Park is a huge waste of money. I'm selling mine."
1,This game was terrible!,When I saw this game on sale when it just came out I thought it would be a blast but I was wrong.When it came out it was $(...) and I saved my money for almost a month and a half and when I finally got it I raced up to my computer to check it out. It took eight minutes to load and it takes one minute to get out. After a week of playing I did not like it any more. I espcially did not like the stupid ant telling you what to do. Compare Sim Theme park to Rollercoaster Tycoon(my personal favorite)Sim Theme Park is just a pile of junk.
3,"Almost, but not quite good enough","Sim Theme Park is a good game but the Sim games have met their match in this area with Roller Coaster Tycoon. The gameplay, graphics, and every thing else is nowhere as good as Roller Coaster Tycoon."
3,Good and Bad but not 'The Best',"SimTheme Park is beautiful to look at, and its ability to let you RIDE your rides (and walk around your park with a camcorder) is cooler than cool, but if you've played Roller Coaster Tycoon (and LOVED it, as everyone who's ever played it does), then you'll be sorely disappointed in this game. Players won't be able to rotate the play area or customize their rides to anywhere NEAR the level of detail Roller Coaster Tycoon employed, and the gameplay, while pretty, is pretty slow; even on GOOD computers with 3D cards."
2,A disappointment.,"An avid fan of both SIM products and of RollerCoaster Tycoon, I found this game a disappointment.I have a new and exceptionally fast machine (Pentium III with 128 MB RAM), and this program, even from the earliest stages of the game, crawled through each step. As importantly, there are too many things getting in the way of good, old-fashioned game play--the ever-present assistant, the kloodgy interface, the low-grade sea-sickedness one gets from the constant 3D view. Whereas I couldn't stop myself from playing RollerCoaster Tycoon for hours on end, I found it easy to uninstall this software after only four hours of game play.Buyer beware: this game looks and feels NOTHING like RollerCoaster Tycoon. Your best bet, if you really want to try this game, is to wait until the price drops..."
2,Good but slow,"I bought this game in excitement thinking I could get a 2 in one game for sim city and RTC. Which it does but the game is slow and I just got a pentium III 400 and it shuts down. Other then being slow and shutting down, with the 30 min of game time at a time that i have played its a good descent game"
2,Not for users of Windows Me,"Don't get me wrong, this is a really fun game. It just didn't work right on my computer. Once, it crashed so bad, my computer had to go into hibernation. However, if you have Windows 98, then don't hesitate to buy it. It is a great game."
3,Bleh...,"This game looked really fun when I just bought it. So I tried it out but was a bit disappointed...The graphics are a bit iffy and the game overall is a bit complicated. The sideshows and resteraunts are fun to mess around with, and they look different in each theme park. Which is kinda neat, cuz you can put a bunch of salt on your fries... :) It's fun for a while, but it gets a tad boring, especially if you have played Roller Coaster Tycoon before playing this game."
2,Quite Confusing and Complicated,"I ordered this and returned it. I found it very complicating to navigate around. You have to train the staff...like that is kinda too elaborate. The view from looking down at your park makes it hard to build a roller coaster at tall heights. That pesky cannon ball shaped assistant keeps talking too much. I recommend Roller Coaster Tycoon because it is a very user friendly interface, thats elaborate and detailed, but still simple and easy to use ."
1,Don't waste your money!,I was very disapointed in this game. It looked like so much fun until i tried to play it. It was so confusing and frustrating. I recomend Roller coaster tycoon I&II. They are much more enjoyable.
1,Wish I had read the reviews before buying,"As said in the other reviews, this game does not work on Windows XP, their website is down for ""essential"" maintenance, and I threw the box away so I cannot return it. The game may be great on Win98, but there really really should be notice on the box that the game doesn't work on XP or at least an adequate patch available on their website. I agree that the EA has some responsibility for making their games playable on all current platforms! I'll be selling my copy if anyone wants it!"
2,Boring,"I had this game a couple years, at first I loved the game, but then I became annoyed with the stupid ant thing that kept repeating everything again and again. Maybe its just my computer but the words on the game are all jumbled looking and I cant understand the ant. There is only four worlds, which by the way are all the same but different scenary, and they dont give you enough money to buy everything you need. Theres not enough options for this games, theres like 5 different rides, 4 concession stands, and you need like 20 janitors to keep the park clean. Nobody want to ride the ride because they are to expensive, but you will lose money if you lower the price. The game takes forever to load and even longer to get off the game and do something else. Save your money and buy something worth it."
1,Could this Game be any WORSE!?,"I honestly don't think they could have made this game any worse if they tried! It is the most boring game in the world, theres nothing to do, all the worlds are the same, basically it sucks. If you want to get a theme park making game get Roller Coaster Tycoon, its really fun. If you buy this you'll just be wasting money, because trust me, you will never play it again!!!!"
3,Disappointed,"This was a fun game to play on Windows 98. I have played Sim Coaster, so I was pleased overall with STP. When I recently tried to use this with my Windows XP, I found that there is no apparent way to intall and play this game. XP's compatability program is not able to make the game run properly and I found through my own attempts and those of other STP owners that Electronic Arts, which markets this game, is apparently not at all interested in providing aftermarket support to XP users. EA directs you to check other sites for further updates, but does not offer any patches of their own to make XP use possible. I would suggest that XP users that are looking for a sim game look to other vendors programs. Come to think of it, I would suggest that anyone who now uses XP or might in the future consider avoiding Electronic Arts products until they support them."
1,MOST HORRIBLE GAME,i bought this game and i regret buying the game. its boring and stupid. i would rather buy the real game ROLLER COASTER TYCOON dont be stupid like me and buy this game.
1,Good for the first 30 minutes...,"When I first played this game, I loved it so much. I just couldn't pull myself away from the computer screen. I loved it so much that I even blew the [dollar amount] and bought it. I played non-stop for about an hour, then ran out of things to do and quit. I never brought it out again. [...]"
1,A bit Odd,"This game [is bad], to be quite blatient. It is extreamly hard to get your funds going up, for starters, and there are many other thing wrong with it. When you are suposedly losing money, your actualy gaing money, but some times you can go rupt anyways. The rides are a joke, and the interactive ""let-u-ride-it"", isnt interactive. Over all, the only reason I gave it a single star is that when you finaly start making money, you feel so good that you actualy defied what the degsiners seemingly wanted you to do, loose! This game is a definate disapointmen from Sim, and I wouldnt pay so for it."
1,HORRIBLE GAME!,"I would not go back to this game in a million years. This game is only cool because you get to ride your ride. Also, i had just purchased a new computer and this game would shut down while playing it. I would purchase RCT instead of purchasing this game. RCT is alot better than Sim Theme Park!"
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"First I would like to say that I got it for playstation and it really was not good. RollerCoaster Tycoon was so much better and I hope that none of you buy it because it was THE WORST game ever played by me ..., I would go out and buy a totally different game and I hope I convinced you too. All that [nonsense]about riding your rides, it sucks, Don't buy this game, especially if you already have rollercoaster tycoon because it will disapoint you BIG time!! Don't take your money and waste it, buy a GOOD game!!!!EXTREMELY DISAPOINTING"
2,This is a sim game?,"SimThemePark is a 3-D simulator in which you design & build a theme park of your own. I bought this game once, but promptly returned it because it was not to my liking. The graphics are adequate, but the humor and design of people have gone too far.I liked the sim games like simcopter,simfarm and simisle which had more seriousness and real-life situations in them, but sadly they aren't in stores anymore.I do not recommend this game for anyone."
1,"don't spend anything, it's not worth anything","It is just boring you think you saved something on it when you lose it. Is that good gaming? NO! You can only go to the kingdom you start out with, you can't go to any others that's what it did to me when I played it. So if you get it you must have seen good reviews this one's bad. Trust me DON'T get this game it's not worth anything!!!"
2,Text fails to meet expectations,"While the concept of this book is great--Portuguese for Spanish speakers--the book falls flat in a number of areas crucial to language acquisition. First, all of the instructions are in English, followed by examples in Portuguese and Spanish. At first this sounds ideal, but it is very taxing to work between the three languages--especially in a collegiate level language course that moves very quickly. In addition, the instructions are incomplete, and often say that they provide basic information because the student is not ready for the entire explanation. A complete beginner with a Spanish background may find this book a useful reference for the absolute basic sentence constructions, but anyone attempting to learn about more advanced constructions (such as the personal infinitive, the future subjunctive, etc.) should consider alternative textbooks and audiocassette series."
5,Glad I got my textbook in time,The book was cheaper than in bookstores and I got it in good time so I could have it for class.
3,misspelling?,"Is the misspelling of 'licenca' (second c has cedilla) an indication of carelessness? I don't think the word is supposed to be in Spanish (which would then be a correct spelling) because then the phrase doesn't make sense; the translation in Spanish would be con permiso, not con licencia. Even with a correct spelling, I think it's an odd title for a text book."
1,Excuse me?,"I haven't read this book, but I'm Brazilian and I can tell that the title is wrong. The correct is ""Com Licena"", and it means ""Excuse me""."
4,Difficult but worthwhile,"This is a densely written book with references and vocabulary that may elude the layman. The first 2 chapters are particularly difficult. Nonetheless, the issues are fascinating and the arguments are honest and disciplined. And strangely, there are some quite funny observations as well. If you are interested in an in depth look at the philosophical underpinnings of identity politics and of the eternal conflict between the individual and society, this book is for you."
4,It's what you'd expect,"As for the content, it's quite philosophical, and very challenging in the first chapter. If you stick with it through the first 13ish pages you'll find that it gets much more understanding and hitting home.Perfect e-book excluding the fact that it doesn't have page numbers. It's like any other books out there if you've gotten them before."
2,Too elitist,"This text is intended for teachers, NOT students. Appiah uses too many obscure words and expressions. Perhaps he is only trying to impress his elitist colleagues at Harvard. Too much blah, blah, blah about John Stuart Mill and not enough about the ethics of identity. Students may find only one-third of it readable and engaging."
1,dont buy from this seller,"The cd case was damaged when it arrived, but the package was fine. I can only guess that the seller shipped it in this condition, and the product discription said it was a new item and in good condition."
4,Fiskars 7933 replacement tree pruner saw blade 15 _inch. I like it very much.,i lked the blade as it was hard for me to get any where else.it really does well. doesnt bend up like some blades.
5,THE PERFECT BLADE,"This is by far the best tree prunning blade I have ever used. When I opened the package, I thought it would cut poorly like a simular blade I once used. Was I wrong, this blade cuts on the pull stroke making cuts much easier and with less effort. I was very surprised at how quickly it would cut through any type of tree limb. The largest limb I cut was about 2"" in diameter and it was easy. It almost make's tree prunning fun. You can't go wrong with this blade."
3,Saw Blade,"Fits correctly, shipped promptly. Saw balde does not cut as effectively as the original. Blade has new tooth design."
2,fizzled,"The premise of this movie is intriguing and the allegorical parallels to drug addiction are actually well portrayed. Unfortunately the very low production values seriously degrade this film. Let's face it, open heart surgery in a dimly lit room that looks like it's in a warehouse basement??! I could go on and on with examples of not only poor sets, but of cheesy lighting, poor sound, and horror elements that are about as scary as shelling peanuts. The transfer quality to the dvd is pretty awful, too; washed out colors, & erratic volume. Perhaps this movie was more enjoyable on the big screen?? Two stars for the eye candy and maybe a half star for the effort..."
3,Enjoyable,"I have to admit after reading the reviews I waited until this movie went on sale to purchase it. I wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find I really enjoyed this movie. The two leads, Bill and Craig (Matthew Montgomery from ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"") had great chemistry together and the plot was extremely original.Now I have seen better production values on a Sci-Fi channel Saturday night movie, but for a low-budget, sci-fi and gay-themed film this movie is far better than say ""Boa vs. Python"" or ""Megasnake.""Take a chance on this film, I think you'll like it."
1,Electro Lust,"Simply ghastly film with an interesting premise, a talented (and comely) Matthew Montgomery, and absolutely nothing else going for it. Obviously made on a limited budget, this sci-fi tale of a lightning strike survivor and his involvement with a group of electroshock fetishists (also survivors of lightning strikes)could still have been a success, had there been a decent script, a competent lead actor, and some semblence of direction. As it is, the film is a frustrating waste of time."
2,socket,"The plot was sort of obvious but it was good to see the two main characters were gay and in a loving relationship. I hate to admit it,but the Male nudity (though not at all gratuituous) was the onlygood thing about the movie."
1,Those are 93 minutes I'm never getting back in my life!,"I don't know if the makers of this movie intended to create some type of metaphor for society's abundant drug use, or if it's just a somewhat glammed-up extreme and creative representation of S&M types that get off on shocking themselves with electricity. Whatever the purpose behind this film I assure you that it's nothing the details claimed it'd be. This is certainly NOT a ""fiery hot erotic thriller"", and by no means is the story an ""exceptional sci-fi fantasy."" The movie is low D-grade camp at best!"
1,Why do we waste the money,"This is a typical film that is more about getting something on tape than it is about telling a story well.Perhaps if there were a local arts council to provide adequate funding this film could have hired the talent it needed to execute on the concept. The writer needed external folks to fill roles he filled himself.It comes off as exactly what it was - a film produced on a budget reserved for a concept not an entire work. By stretching the funds this tight the film remains in the bin of ""if only.... ""I think I'd like to see less desire for ""celebrity at all costs"" and more focus on ""I will only do what I can afford - nothing more."""
4,Socket,"Quite a well made gay love story with tragic serial killer twist.Some minor male nudity,very much in context and naturalistic but not especially erotic.Quite well acted .Held my attention as story unfolded.I enjoyed it as a good scifi yarn with beleivable characters."
2,Suckit,This movie was so bad it was good...I loved it! I could not stop laughing at everything about it. The actors weren't so bad but the story was so lame. It's worth renting just to see exactly how bad gay movies can be. A major swing and miss. Should have been called SuckIt but then everyone would assume it was porn.
1,One of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!,"This movie changed my life. After viewing the movie I said to my self, ""I can't believe I just waisted one hour and thirty minutes of my life."" Just because the actors are gay it doesn't mean they can ""act"" in a gay movie!!!!I would continue with a negative review, but I do not intend to waist any more time re: this mov.."
2,"I don't like this movie, so dark","I love the passion and the story in this story at first; however, the story turns out to be so dark. The way the group love dancing club and was addicted to electric reminds me uncomfortably about the dark side of the gay life that i never want to face and also drug. I should've been more careful when buying movie"
1,OMG Don't waste the money,Man this movie sucked. If you want to see a hole bunch of flasid penises and horrrible acting than this is the movie for you! It was just aweful please don't make the same mistake I did.
2,"poor explanation, Weak Language","Dr. Han is a leader in Data Mining; but unfortunately this book does not speak for that. The explanation is poor, the language is weak and thus, the book is not at all a good read. The book by Pang-Ning Tan and Kumar is much better.The only good thing is that the second edition has a comprehensive coverage and contains many recent topics (streaming, social network, etc.) which is not available in other textbooks."
3,Maybe I Expected Too Much,"In reading this book, you can see the differences between the two writers - in fact, gimme a sentence or two and I can probably tell you which one wrote what - but I think I expected a little too much from this book. Obviously, info on what pitches a pitcher used during his career is subject to availability and maybe I expected Neyer, and especially James, to come up with more info than they did - it is mainly newspaper quotes and maybe just a handful of direct quotes from the pitchers themselves, via e-mail. I thought the chapters on each type of pitch was interesting in how they ranked pitchers and how those pitches differed but I can't help but think they were just filler, done only to probably fill out the book - I was hoping there would be more pitchers listed than there were in the book but I guess only so much info was was available to them."
2,A major disappointment -- as other readers have noted,"After reading Rob Neyer's *Big Book of Baseball Lineups*, I was expecting another gem. But this book has little to recommend it except for the essays on near-Hall of Fame caliber pitchers Mel Harder, Billy Pierce, Tommy Bridges, Bucky Walters and several others. The lists of best fastball and breaking ball pitchers appear idiosyncratic, while the analysis is simple-minded and redolent of bar-stool advocacy (at least when one considers that the evaluators are renowned sabermetricians). Save your money for Alan Schwarz's new book, *The Numbers Game: Baseball's Lifelong fascination with Statistics*. He's a better writer than either Neyer or James and has a fascinating story to tell."
4,Groundbreaking data,"The star of this book is the data: an encyclopedia of thousands of major league pitchers and information on their pitch repetoire, along with sources. This is groundbreaking, never-before-collected data and it will surely prove to be a boon for baseball researchers. For their work collecting this data, Neyer and James deserve serious kudos.The book also features articles describing pitches, how they're thrown, variations, their evolutions, and their key practitioners. This is good information as well.However, these articles and others in the book seem to suffer from the authors' informal tone. Often, we're treated to disagreements between the two authors which don't particularly add to our understanding of the subject.Though it could have used tighter editing, the book is still a joy. James remains a tremendously gifted writer and analyst and, again, this data is priceless."
4,Great book!,"This is a truly fascinating book, particularly for a person that never made it (even in little league) as a baseball player.The bulk of the book I haven't read yet, but have used if some for reference, the majority of the pages (about 500) are the Pitcher Census. It has the major pitches thrown by EVERY pitcher to throw over 1000 innings.There are also bios about several important or interesting pitchers, and then a description of where the major pitches come from, who is credited with creating it, and other info.I'd highly recommend this book to any baseball fan."
5,Great Movie Series,"I have always enjoyed these movies. All have good plots and keeps the action going through out the movie, which some new directors should try to do more in their movies. It's hard sometime to go back and watch without laughing at some of the scenes, since the release of the Airplane Movie spoofs and vise versa."
2,Airport '79-The Concord,This movie is more of a cartoon than a professionaly made movie! George Kennedy as the pilot of the supersonic aircraft (bad enough right there) and doing fighter aircraft maneuvers? Ridiculous.
3,Airport '75/Airport '77,The only 2 movies that I liked was Airport '75 and Airport '77. I did not care for Airport or Airport '79 - The Concord. But if you loved the first Airport movie you will love the rest too.
3,airport terminal pack,very good on delivery i ordered the week before and it arrived the next week wonderful. in the pack airport is the only one which had 5.1 surround decoding. the rest of the films were decoded in 2.1 which was dissapointing. the picture quality was acceptional wouldnt say it was great.having said that it was amazing to find the pack in the first place as it is not available in uk at all.
3,Order Review,"The item was received in a timely fashion. The item consisted of a set of DVD's. I have only had a chance to view one of the movies, and had some problems with my DVD players reading the entire thing. I do not see any visible scratches, but my DVD players would encounter inability to read certain sections. I may need to have the DVD resurfaced. The other DVD's may have the same problem, but I do not yet know. This is most likely a manufacturing flaw and not a fault of the supplier."
1,Don't play,Bought this set as a gift - none of the disks play on the recipient's DVD player. Will be requesting a refund.
1,A Great Film Series,"Having discovered that all the AIRPORT movies were in one DVD set I was very excited about it as it is one of my favourite film series. I received them very fast considering they were imported from America. I am very pleased with them, although having read some of the reviews that were submitted I was very disappointed that so many people has criticised Airport '75 because in my opinion it was without a doubt the best of the Airport series. I thought it had a gripping story and was very suspensful with a great cast and score to back it up. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, and is definately a worthy addition to this fantastic film series. Also to all those people who don't like the movies here is a tip, DON'T BUY IT, and leave them alone for the people who do appreciate them."
5,Awasome set!,"Yes! I love disaster movies, this is a great set, each movie is an actual classic, great performances by Jacqueline Bisset and Karen Black, keeps you in suspense and entertained."
3,"NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE, BUT FOR NOSTALGIA MOSTLY!","The Hollywood disaster films of the 70's are remembered fondly by the people who grew up with them. I was one of those kids who saw these films in a large theater. I watched the original 'Airport' from this set and must say it is a weaker film than ""Poseidon"", ""Towering"" and even....""Earthquake"" The film has the formula, but it is way too long(135 minutes) and there is not enough disaster for my taste. Even though ""Airport"" came out first, it's not the best disaster epic by a long shot. By the time the sequels were coming out, the disasters epics were starting to wear thin. Although the 'Airport' series are good for what they are...whatever that is? They are certainly entertaining and fun except Airport 79 Concord! The transfers are very good and I found this set for under $10.00! It's hard to argue at that price! If your a fan of the series.....what the heck!?1)Airport - 3 Stars2)Airport 75 - 3 Stars3)Airport 77 - 3 Stars4)Airport 79 - 1 Star"
1,"Airport, Airport 77, and Airport 79 were great transfers","Three of the movies in this set look great, and fortunately...the true classic, ""Airport"", is one of them. With the exception of the hammy George Kennedy, this movie really WAS a classic.However, if someone has a copy of ""Airport 75"" from this ""pack"" that is in proper ratio, it can only mean that Universal fixed the problem. My guess is that it is more likely that some aren't as discriminating a viewer as those of us who noticed this problem. It certainly isn't that those with complaints with this DVD have the ""aspect ratio on their tv or DVD player is set wrong"". How could that be if every other DVD looks fine?Universal is known for shoddy workmanship. Purchase this one at your own risk....as I'm betting they haven't corrected the ""Airport 75"" transfer problem since the set's initial release."
1,Yet Another Botched DVD Release From Universal,"What is up with Universal Home Video these days?Airport 75 on this set is not properly framed, resulting in a stretched picture.Let's see..........E.T. was botched only because no one knew exactly what each edition actually contained.Back To The Future had framing issues on films 2 and 3.Monty Python's Meaning Of Life has all the progressive scan flags set in the wrong position. This is a major blunder, and should have been recalled, as it will affect those who later upgrade their DVD and TV hardware.Schindler's List should have been a 2-disc set, with audio options as part of the menu on side 2.I could go on and on...."
3,"Sorry, Universal: here goes another framing problem","Buyers beware: all transfers in this pack are fine (even the awful 'Airport 79' and its ridiculous special effects), except that there is a problem with 'Airport 75'. For some reason, the 2,35:1 anamorphic framing has not been properly handled, and as a result, the image retains a slight horizontal squeeze that can be really annoying: the 747's wings looks much too short, its wheels are not circular but oval, and all actors look unnaturally thin (especially Charlton Heston who looks like he could use some bodybuilding...)After all the trouble we had with the 'Back to the Future"" pack, this is another fine mess from Universal..."
2,Typical of most generic shop repair manuals,Not a bad shop manual except one critical piece of information is not thoroughly outlined or explained......the Vehicle Identification Number Chart for all 1970-1980 model bikes. I have a 1980 FXB Sturgis shovelhead with the following VIN stamped on the frame and which matches the title paperwork:7G4974J0Table 4 on page 18 of this book doesn't show the second character in the chart. Don't know what other information is missing within the text that could be critical.
1,Wrong Part,I Orderd this part for an engine i was building imagine my supprise when I recieved the part only to find its not a flywheel for a manual transmission but a flex plate for a automatic come on guys pay attention
5,Making macrobiotics sound less crazy,Jessica Porter's light hearted approach to macrobiotics sets this book apart. She doesn't take herself too seriously and admits how nuts it all sounds to someone who has been eating a typical American diet their whole life. It makes the macro philosophy accessible to the most cyncial of us!
4,Hip Chick's Review,"The book came promptly and in the condition it was promised. It's an amazing philosophy - but I'm wondering how realistic is it to impose on a family of 5. That being said, I do think it' inspired me to infuse our diet with many more healthy options and the recipes are worth trying. Mrse"
3,macrobiotic,"includes some helpful tips, the most helpful tip was to read other material on the topic inluding the book inspired by the creator Dr. Kushi"
5,Beware of Kindle Edition/Table 1 unreadable/Great book,"This is a wonderful book. However, I downloaded it to my new Kindle and immediately had problems reading the first Table even after adjusting to the largest font. I wrote customer service today thinking they would back it up with a text copy or some refund but they just said this will happen and side-stepped the issue. I don't really find this an acceptable policy when a very important part of the book is unreadable."
1,Just awful!,This is my first review on Amazon after hundreds of purchases. What a horrible book. It is totally stupid. Just somebody going on and on about how food is yin and yang. Very little instruction. Occasional rants about how she went off her diet and it was bad for her. This is a complete waste of money and time. Don't buy it! Just awful!
1,"kindle books should be *cheaper*, not more expensive","A friend recommended this book and I came to Amazon to buy it. I don't buy paper books any longer as ebooks are more convenient and I am reducing the amount of ""stuff"" I have sitting around the house.I discovered that Penguin has the ridiculous policy of charging more for an ebook that has no physical component than for a paper book that they had to print, deliver to Amazon and Amazon has to ship to me. If the publisher and Amazon are making money on that paperback that I get delivered to my door for $12.92, then they must be making a tremendous amount on an ebook that comes over the web. A rip-off amount, actually.One might almost imagine that the publisher is trying to discourage people from buying ebooks so they don't have to change their business model.Which is having the effect that I'm *NOT* going to buy this book at all."
5,Hip Chicks Unite,"A wonderful approach to eating brown rice, learning about exotic green stuff aka sea vegetables and the universe. Not only does Ms. Porter make her argument for eating mindfully humorous, the recipes are great and the advice about relationships are excellent. Geez, she can write about naked candybars and the universality of love making and gender differences in a way that makes me give broccoli in the produce section a doubletake. 'Hey, did that vegetable just wink at me?' Hilarious and soulful, it feels as though Ms. Porter is sitting next to you holding your hand and explaining it all. A special book that is beyond self-help and recipes. She helps you to think bigger and laugh."
2,Ok but nothing exceptional,"Although this is rather a 'fun' read it does not provide a compelling reason to follow a macrobiotic diet, after you have finished the book. The author appears to be committed to the macrobiotic diet to a lesser extent than I expected, given that she was writing a book on the topic. Her admissions to still indulging in french fries and other junk food, while at the same time extolling the virtues of giving macrobiotics your all seems contradictory to say the least. Sure, we all fall of the wagon (whatever that means for each of us) at times but Ms. Porter's descriptions of forbidden cravings and lapses seemed a lot more than that.I was also dismayed to read that all the nightshade plants are forbidden on this diet, including tomatoes and potatoes. No way could I commit to that.Not the worst dietary book I've read but certainly not the best. Try it from the library first, before investing in a copy for yourself, if you are seriously looking for answers re: macrobiotics."
5,Informative and a Great Read,"As a newcomer to the macrobiotic lifestyle, I am always looking for books on the topic. Jessica Porter is awesome - she conveys the information in a succinct, clear and non-condescending manner. Not to mention the fact that she is really funny! Not only did I learn a lot from this book, but I also really enjoyed reading it."
2,Who has this much time?,"Seriously, I want to eat healthier, but I need a break. This seems to be written for someone who has a fairy tale life and has hours to prepare meals. Also, alot of time spent on the spiritual aspect of Macrobiotics. That's great but I just wanted recipes, not another full time job."
3,Decent Read,"Jessica's approach is hip and fun, but it's certainly not for everyone. Being into the Paleo lifestyle, I thought this might be another more scientific way of looking at things, but left a so-so- taste in my mouth. A friend of mine borrowed it and ended up moving away and abandonning our friendship-- hopefully they got more out of the book than I did!"
3,OK,"I found part of it useful, a little scattered. Not quite what I was looking for BUT might be the perfect book for someone else."
3,A Personal Journey to Macrobiotics,"If you are just starting to delve into macrobiotics, this is not the book for you. Although whimsical, it is one person's story of their entry into the macrobiotic way of life, not a resource for someone who wants to learn what macrobiotics is and the philosophy behind it. The recipes are okay. I think I may have book marked one or two. There are better books available from Amazon that would be beneficial to a novice."
4,Hip Guide for those new to Macrobiotics,"Good resource, but a little bit complicated in places regarding the finer points of excess yin and yang. Good recipes; would have liked a few more home remedy recipes for common ailments."
3,Unsubstantiated claims,I was disappointed by Ms.Porter's lack of a bibliography to back up some of the more controversial content in the book. Dairy causes wet spots in your lungs? (just one example that she never explains)She seemed to shoot from the hip without backing up her statements. I am sure she is not a medical professional nor a nutritionist and should not be representing this information as remotely factual. The fact that she prefaces many of these statements with the wording that 'it can be debated' does not let her off the hook. The publishers should have demanded better. Anything can and will be debated. Most authors do not write books amounting to conjecture and have someone buy it. I am glad that I did not pay full price. I hope that people do their own research before taking parts of this book as the truth. Talk with your physician.
3,I'm not excited,"If you want to see artists working in polymer clay .. this will give you each artist's mini biography and a photo of one of their creations. No instructions are in this book.I""m not excited about this book and if it was in a store and I was going through it I would not have bought it. If you can buy it second hand ... fine."
2,Portable Studio,"The product came in a very timely manner. It's extremely compact, but it's not all that. I will need to buy different lights... but overall, it's okay for the money."
2,eh,"lights were not as bright as i hoped for however i did end up using them outside of this photo box to light other things. the box itself is not very useful either, and the colors of the backgrounds were kinda useless."
2,Not great,This was pretty unimpressive. The quality wasn't good and the lights were far too weak. I wouldn't buy this again. We ended up just using lights from the hardware store and a piece of white poster board.
2,A bit disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed when my husband opened this product. It claimed on the description as well as the box that there was a diffuser background included, but there was nothing in the box. Thank god I bought him a pack of 5 different color backgrounds for the mini studio as well."
4,"Good product for the price, lights could be better.","I concur with what many of the other people have said. The tent itself works great, and the blue and grey backdrops are effective... though the black and white backdrops you can order directly from Sakar are less so, as the white comes across as faded and dingy, since the black of the other side shows through. A way to acquire more diverse backdrops would be nice.The included lamps, however, are pretty weak, so you'll need to fit them with higher wattage bulbs and/or buy some additional lights to get better shots. As the tripod also leaves something to be desired, though its limitations are understandable given the need to be portable. If it's convenient for you, however, I recommend using a larger tripod and placing the tent on an elevated surface.It's a decent product -- but it would be perfect with more backdrop options and better lamps."
4,Good enough...,"I bought this table-top ""studio"" to photograph small items for use on a website.It was very easy to assemble and I used it right away. I love that there was a tiny tripod included in this kit. All was well until I saw the resultant photos--the color balance is variable so sometimes the backdrop--which is blue--looks gray, sometimes pale blue--but the products themselves show up with colors that are ""off."" Also, you really can't photograph things as large as a honkin' purse because the constraints of the box are tight. Good for small items--no bigger than about 6""X 6...."" OK for what I'm doing, but not adequate for anything larger.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBF400/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Ok but did not reduce shadows,The photo box was ok but it did not reduce the shadows as we had hoped. We still needed to Photoshop the images to get them cleaned up. The kit comes in a nice case which is good because you have everything together.
4,Portable Lighting Studio,"This item was a gift. I am using the lights that were included with the product. Many of the items I am photogaphing are varied in color and the specialized lights allow for accurate and consistent reproduction when posted to E-Bay. I am also using the tripod. The ""studio"", however, is too small for most of the things I photograph."
2,Lights are not bright enough .... only tent is usable,"The portable tent is really nice with this product, however, the lights are too small to light inside the tent effectively.Really disappointing."
2,Bulbs are cheap in construction and fragile,Guess it is as good as any other on the market. This is my second one as with my first one the plastic melted on the lights because there were no instructions or warnings not to face the housing in the down position. Too much heat caused the covers to melt and they were ruined within the first 30 minutes of taking pictures. I had to learn from my mistake while this manufacturer assumed that every beginning photographer knows what to do.
1,NEED MORE LIGHT!!!!,"Concept is great, set up is easy, price is right. HOWEVER...... the lighting provided is no way near enough to take any decent picture."
3,small item light box,"I looked at and read the reviews for several units of this type out there. I selected this one for price and reviews. I must say I was a little disappointed. The light box is OK, but with no instructions you have to look at the box for pictures on setting it up. the lights are not bright enough in my opinion to fully illuminate objects inside the light box. I will see if I can find something brighter and set up in a permanent spot. the tripod I would not trust with an expensive, big digital camera. It is fine for the smaller units. I bought this to take better pictures for ebay and I think it will work out for the small die cast cars I shoot with some extra lights. But to rely on this as a true portable studio I don't think it does."
3,"somewhat pleased,yet disappointed",delivery time was good. one of the lightbulbs was burned out and is impossible to find in my small town. i am using other lights and a different background. the pictures do look good.
3,lights are not bright,"Bought this about 5 months ago, 1 lamp burnt out and now waiting for 3-4 months for Sakar to replace it. I not holding my breathe anymore as I called 4-5 times asking when will my replacement lamp come. The first time they were out of stock, they said 1 month they'll get them in. Well after 2 months I called they said you'll have it in 2 weeks, called again you'll have it in 2 weeks, called again you'll have it in 2 weeks.....LOL well it's getting close to Christmas, maybe Santa will deliver it to me...LOL"
2,Lights are insufficient,"I bought this to photograph small items to sell on my online shop. Items smaller than a lady's shoe. This setup is only barely large enough to accommodate that. And you need to get creative to make most shots work.The lighting is woefully under powered. The backdrops are solid, but I would have liked a white or black backdrop instead of that garish blue.If you are shooting tiny objects (like the size of a matchbox toy car) and have access to supplemental lighting - this may work great for you.I do like how nicely everything folds up. It has been neatly folded up and stored away since about an hour after I unpacked it and realized it wouldn't suit my needs."
1,Flimsy construction,"This product has all it claims to have, but the construction is very flimsy in a key area. The legs for the lights are very thin sheet metal, and on mine the legs jammed and bent within minutes of unpacking. I called the vendor, Big Value, and got a refund (except for shipping). So, the rating for the product is ""no stars at all"" but the rating for Big Value is five stars. I bought a similar product by Sunpak that is very sturdy and well made."
4,camera photo box,This outfit is excellent and does an excellent job for taking pictures of coins. The only issue we had with it is that one of the light bulbs were no good when we got it and we had to go out and purchase an $8 replacement bulb
5,PS-101Lightbox kit Lamp Upgrade,"The light box construction is well done and executed.!The two lamps provided are 20 watt units, and a bit weak for the purpose.The lights can be upgraded to 35 watt or 50 watt halogens. You need 120 volt GU10 type replacements available at home center stores or here on Amazon. (Push in and twist 1/4 turn to remove the lamps)If you do upgrade to the higher wattage lamps, use them only intermittently. Also unscrew and remove the front lamp retaining ring to allow increased airflow around the higher wattage lamps. After the lamps cool, replace the ring for secure storage of the lamps.The tripod provided works OK, and supports my Lumix DMC-FZ7 without a problem."
4,Convenient and Complete,"Pros: Compact and complete, this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it's reversible backdrop (gray/blue). I also have used the black back panel for some shots as well. Construction quality is good ( I found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel, which is fabric and held in place with Velcro tabs), sturdy enough for its intended purpose. I like the output of the lights--seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight.Cons: Only one complaint: The output of the lights could be stronger. Requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture."
2,Lights are terrible,"The light tent is very nice and it folds down into a carrying case. The lights however, are terribly underpowered. Even with the lights half an inch from the tent fabric, I was shooting at 1/20th of a second at f5.6, and at a macro setting the depth of field is very poor. These lights might work as fill if you use a much brighter one on top, but then you'd have to get one that matches the halogen bulbs/filters that these use.Buy a tent seperately, and get some reflector lights and daylight bulbs at the hardware store. THis isn't worth the money."
2,Almost worthless,"The tent is decent and the portability is excellent. However, the lights are woefully underpowered and the bulbs create uneven color casts. The tripod is flimsy, frustrating, and almost useless, but this is the price of portability as well. I ended up buying clamp reflectors with 150 watt daylight bulbs at a local home builder's store. I also replaced the blue/black backdrop with a white one, and added the velcro strips to hold it in place. You can purchase better domes or tents from online photo retailers, but they are more expensive. Do a little research to discover your needs, and be sure to use the white-balance feature of your digital camera. At first this item looks like a good idea at a reasonable price, but its performance comes up short."
3,Great Way To Fix The Light Problem,"The concept is good, but the lights were a problem. They are not strong enough, and they get extremely hot. I fixed the problem very easily. First, I turned the lighting studio upside down, so the three white boards were like so: [_] Two sides of white board, and one white board on the bottom. Nothing on the top. Then I took a two bulb reptile light (heat lamp type light) for a ten gallon aquarium tank. I switched the reptile lights with 75 watt light bulbs. The reptile light is long, goes straight across, and sits atop a ten gallon tank. You simply rest the metal light right on top of this portable studio. It fits perfectly. Put your item right on the bottom so you have a white background, and you don't have to buy a white backdrop this way either (this only comes with a royal blue backdrop). I take jewelry pictures, and the pictures come out great using this method."
2,Save Your Money - This Product Is Not A Good Choice,"I would not suggest you buy this kit unless you only want the tent. One of the bulbs burned out within 2 minutes of my first time using and the second bulb burned out the next time I used it. In addition the lights are so flimsy that the weight of the cord pulls them down. In other words the lights are virtually worthless. I ended up buying another product called a litehouse and I am using it without artificial lighting and it works better than the ""lighting studio"" with lights. I gave this product 2 stars because the tent is not bad."
5,wonderful buy!,"For years I've been trying to take decent photos of my work. This portable light box is so simple and has everything you could need. The price is amazing. Upon ordering, I wasn't sure if it really included the lights and such because it was so inexpensive but it did! It has the perfect amount of light and the best part of it all is that after my photos are taken, I can pack the whole package up and put it away in my studio. I can't remember when I've been so pleased with a purchase - I just wish I'd done it sooner."
1,Is this item necessary?,"I went from a two tube fluorescent light and a bed sheet to the Studio which I bought at the best price via Amazon. It is well packaged and well engineered but less convenient to use than my bed sheet 'studio'. Its size limits its use to stuff like small figurines, etc."
3,Not for Beginners but a good tape if you are past that stage....,Jennifer talks in a well modulaterd and controlled voice which is exactly the way in which she moves. She is a dancer and a teacher and that is evident in the way she instructs you in the various poses. If you are truly a beginner I wouldn't recommend this tape until you have practiced on some of the really beginning level tapes. While Jennifer does a credible job talking you through the moves it can be a little overwhelming and self defeating if you find you can not really keep up. She tries to tell you that you will build up to it but there are easier tapes to build some basic strength and then you can do these series of exercises. As usual I feel great after completing one of her tapes.
5,excellent yoga tape,Jennifer is such an wonderful instructor.. i have recommend her tapes to bother strangers in target and friends. the yoga breathing leaves me calm and focused every time. Thanks !
4,Makes you feel great,"It is a pretty challenging workout for a complete beginner, I couldn't finish it from the first attempt. Sometimes Jennifer Kries moves too fast for a novice follower. But as you do it again and again it becomes easier with each time and makes you feel terrific. No back pain as a result, great (very gentle and very effective) flexibility workout and most important - great relaxation techniques. Really worth trying it!"
3,a bit disappointing,"I am not too familiar with yoga and I bought this video because first I wanted to learn yoga and second I like almost all Firm tapes, especially those with Jennifer Kries as the instructor. I was a bit disappointed with the exercises though. If you want to buy it for learning yoga, it is better to choose another video, one that is especially for beginners and if you want to buy it only for flexibility, then choose another one that concentrates more on flexibility and stretching."
1,HAUNTED hOUSE,I ORDERED THIS BOOK BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT AS OF 6/25I THOUGHY IT MIGHT BE BACK ORDERED
4,Lots of useful information,"I did not have any use for astrology before I found Zolar. His astrology is useful and relevant, and this book is pretty accurate in predicting how well two people will mesh based on their star signs."
3,Good for the price,"I purchased the towel bar, towel ring, and toilet paper holder a couple of years ago. They are good for the price - the only complaint I would have is instead of being wrought iron - it is more like steel that is painted. The paint does come off via wear and tear and has to be touched up, but for the price that's ok."
3,Leading Where?,"Though lacking focus, this book, written to Asian-American leaders, prompts questions of how our ethnicity, and the upbringing that may have gone along with that, effects how we lead and how we are led. Though most of Tokunaga's examples are based on stereotypes, or what is usually expected, from Asian homes, his points are universal in that we all have been raised in a certain way and many of us have not examined how that upbringing has shaped our world view. Tokunaga also focuses on how the Christian church needs to be aware of the different views different upbringings tend to foster as we try and reach others for Christ. Tokunaga's own story is very compelling, but his stories sometimes get in the way of his being able to make clear points to move his arguments along. He also repeats various points at different times in the book which can frustrate the reader, thinking that we have been over this ground before."
4,Eden not so much,"This book was written with a bit more of the author's slant than I thought it would be. I found it difficult to read because one page might contain the normal reading, heiroglyphics, footnotes, and notes and references referred to quite often. I felt like I was searching through the book rather than reading it.I enjoyed the story behind the book, but I wonder how accurate the translations of Egyptian text are.I am fascinated with ancient Egypt, so this book was cool to add to my collection, but the reading wasn't easy."
3,the browns,"Disappointed that this CD didn't also have The Old Lamplighter on it. Most other songs pleasant to listen to, though."
3,Soft Bristled Brush,This is a soft-bristled bush - fine for more delicate hands. It's not the stiff-bristled kind of brush you would find to clean acrylic nails (the kind used at most nail salon).
3,Blitz: Not for the weak in spirit,"When I bought Blitz the league I was hoping for an experience a little different then the madden games give you, and I definitely got that. This game gets down into the ""real"" world of professional football. It has painkillers and steroids and other things like that, that really are not officialy part of football but are still there. I enjoyed it for awhile but no one will play it online it seems like. So I would say if you are looking for an experience of football different then madden go ahead get this game, but if you are faint of heart you might want to think twice about getting this game because there is blood and profanity. I gave this game a three mostly because it is lacking in online players and because its just a little over the top on violence and profanity, but if you just want to enjoy a little simplified football (with a little bit more attitude) by yourself then I would reccomend this game to you."
3,SAME AS FIRST XBOX EDITION,"Don't get your hopes up for anything different it's the exact same game graphics and music. they just converted it to work for the 360.It's fun , but it's the same damn game."
1,Beware...Xylitol can be deadly to your pet,"I strongly urge Amazon.com to pull this product. My employer has a yorkie, and she almost lost her pet because of this very product. Xylitol, the third item on the Breathalyser ingredient list, has been proven to be a toxic chemical to animals. It's been shown that as little as three grams can be fatal to a medium-sized dog. It causes precipitous hypoglycemia, liver damage, blood-clotting problems, and dehydration. Google ""xylitol pet health"" for more info, and check it out on snopes.com. Also check out avma.org (american veterinary medical association) and do a search on xylitol."
1,Beware xylitol!,"I have not used this product specifically, but research studies have indicated that xylitol (an alcohol with a sweet taste) can be harmful to dogs. There are other products available that do not contain xylitol."
4,"Well, the pets LOVE it...","This product was prescribed by my collie's vet, because of all four of my middle aged, animals (dogs and cats), she has terrible teeth, and the breath that goes with it. I don't know if it will help with her ongoing problem with tartar build-up, but it definitely helps her breath. And all of the animals seem to love the water with the product added. (If you smell it, it smells just like a particularly yucky kind of candy!) So at least everyone is getting plenty of water."
5,Fabulous Pillows,"Simmons Beautyrest pillows are simply fabulous. They are fairly but not overly firm and are great for back or side sleeping. And for the money, you will never find a better longer lasting pillow. I have been using them for years."
5,Robert el ex-menudo regresa,Despues de estar fuera por un tiempo a regresado mejor que nunca con más fuerza que nunca.Espero que tenga mucho exito.Le desean su mejor fanática de Puerto Rico.
2,This not for those look for a light read...,"The book was written from a single woman in her 20s which I love. It started light and humerous. But with every page, it became heavier and heavier. It was TOO serious!! This is not the ""chick-lit"" I expected to read from the excerpt. I was disappointed with it overall. And the story seem to drag along. I honestly would put the book down and wonder should I continue. There were too many characters. The chapters were VERY long. The whole book was one bad situation after the next. I know God puts us all through tests but the plot of this book was over the top. I purchased this book with the hopes of reading something humerous, light, and spiritual. My expectations were not met except for the spiritual. The references to how God speaks to us in a quiet voice was nice and the Scropture references were nice as well."
3,Takes Awhile,"I really enjoyed this book.I read ""If the Shoe Fits"" first which was a lovely book.This is the first book in the series.It started slowly but after awhile I just couldn't put itdown.This is the type of book that slowly drags you in.I would suggest reading it and then read ""If the Shoe Fits"" I really Liked that book."
2,Did not enjoy this book at all,"When I first picked up Made of Honor, I thought it had a lot of promise based on the blurb on the back cover. However, I was disappointed. I just did not like the author's first person style of writing, I felt the characters spent too much time on introspection and analyzing every detail of every plot scenario, to the point where I felt this book was unreadable. More action and less navel-gazing please."
2,Very Slow!!!!,"Maybe it was me but this book needed lots of editing. I just didn't flow. I skipped several chapers to find the ""interesting parts"" after all the great reviews I was very disappointed."
4,"Great product, but...","I have a lot of allergies and cannot use fragranced products. This does have a slight citrus scent, which is very subtle, but nice. You MUST leave the conditioner in your hair for a few minutes to have it work. I used to slather it on and rinse it off, but would have a ton of tangles in my fine hair. Now I put it in, twist it up on top of my head, wash, and then rinse it out. Works great and no one knows it is a basic (not professional) conditioner. I will continue to purchase this product and recommend it to anyone with sensitivities."
3,2 out of 3 ain't bad,"The package for the oils said (1) Refreshing; (1) Soothing; and (1) Unscented. If only it were so! The refreshing and soothing oil fragrances are nice and light, and the oil is very nice to work with, but the unscented oil was somehow left out and we received the exotic oil instead. BLECK! ""Exotic"" means ""reeks of patchouli."" I decided to go ahead and enjoy the two bottles I like rather than go through Amazon's return process, but I paid for three bottles of oil and only received two I can use."
4,A Decent Reference Book,"Since I have several Judith Baker Montano books, I found this one to be a little disappointing since it's title uses the word ""Handbook"". It is however, chock full of beautiful photos. Probably better for someone who is just venturing into Crazy Quilts to get a better sense of the variety of techniques and how different each one is in the final product."
3,best part,"I was somewhat disappointed in the quilt part of the book, but I love the section at the end of the book where Victoria embroidery stitches are given (complete with directions for some for lefties."
5,The guru of crazy quilts,Well written and illustrated. It gave a varity of ideas and suggestions. It can be used by the novice and seasoned quilter. I would also suggest her encloypedia of stiches.
5,Exciting!!,This was the first book I have read by Grice. I took it everywhere so I could finish reading it. Well written and wonderful warm ending.
5,I love Julia Grice!,"As always, Julia Grice kept me up late reading and I lost a lot of sleep because I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it. Julia keeps the suspense moving and once I started the book I was hooked. I have read several of her other mysteries and find that she always gives you a very fast moving story. Loved it!"
3,Comfortable but not strong,The plastic tabs included to attach the harness to the binoculars broke the first day. The harness itself is comfortable and holds the binoculars conveniently
2,Not what expected,"I'm pretty sure I placed an order for new and fullfilled by Amazon. Apparently it means nothing. They did a great job of packaging the item in an old HP box sealed in an OEM bag. The issue is that while a great knock off of OEM packaging, the fact is I purchased a 75XL cartridge. What I received was a standard size 75 cartridge. I know the price is ""discounted"" and I can deal with a re-manufactured product with ink refill, but the fact that it is a standard size cartridge, means I only get 200 page capacity and not the 750 advertised from the XL. I checked the cartridge dimension for the XL size products on HP's website. It is not original and it is not XL. I will complain to Amazon, but I am not sure what to do about it. Not what was advertised."
2,inkjet print cartridge,bought ink for our HP printer. Almost as soon as the two wereput in the printer it indidcated it was low. Have not had that problem with refills before or since.
5,Good purchase,"Ink is expensive, everyone knows that. But this XL set lasts quite some time and is the actual genuine product. The color comes out nicely and I use it to print photos to decorate my room. My printer can recognize genuine and imitation ink jets, and I can assure you the one I purchased from amazon is cheaper by about $10 AND was manufactured by HP."
1,Dried Ink?,The HP 75XL Tri-color Inkjet Cartridge arrived quickly but it appearsto have dried out since I could not get it to print even though I followedthe instructions to the letter. I am going to ask for a replacement. Theblack cartridge which was in a sealed plastic worked fine.
3,Hp 75XL printer Cartridge,Well to be honest I haven't really got the chance to use the new cartridge yet to see if it does save me the time and postage in Buying one then ordering another soon after. I like to stay ahead of what I need so that I am never with out. Hp makes great products but they could make their brand cartridges a little less expensive to compete with off brands that in my opinion perform the same. I just didn't have time to shop around this time like I usually do.
2,Why you could'nt deliver this product?,"I am very disappointed because you did not deliver this product, arguing incorrect address. But you delivered the printer to the same address, without any problem. Why? I need the print cartridge too !!!"
3,Expensive ink,The only thing cheap about HP is some of the printers you can purchase. The price of this cartridge is so expensive. I got rid of the printer and purchased a laser printer where I can get a few more thousand pages at a much cheaper price. I cannot understand why they get so much money for such a small cartridge of ink. It's a real ripoff.
3,Didn't last as long as expected.Nowhere near 500 pages.,HP 75XL Tri-Color Ink Cartridge: Ran out of ink after printing only 50 pages of our Xmas letter. Would have been cheaper to go to a print shop.
4,HP 75XL tricolor Cartridge,Good product and works well. The price locally is way too expensive for this small amount of ink although it is the XL size. Just glad I could find it on line at a much cheaper price.
1,"yes, very expensive ink","I recently bought a new HP printer that uses these #74 and 75 cartridges. My old 920c used #78 and 15. They were about 31 dollars each, but held 19ml. That's a 1.63 per ml. The 74/75s are 17 dollars and only hold 3.5ml, that's 4.86 per ml.Even with the XL carts (12 ml) at the sale price, its 2.40 per ml. (Before S&H;) I gave that new printer away.My old one may be slower, but its loads cheaper. I also notice now that HP doesn't list the ink capacity on their cartridges anymore. Next printer I get, I'm switching."
1,NOT XL INK,THE INK STATED ABOVE IS NOT AN XL INK BUT A REGULAR SIZED INK. I GOT RIPPED OFF. I LIVE IN THE CARIBBEAN AND IT COST MORE TO RETURN IT
1,dissatisfied customer,"I was completely dissatisified with this ink cartridge product, and in fact, removed it after trying to use it twice. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the printer. I ran diagnostics, and nothing was found, although it said the cartridge was defective. I went out and purchased another refilled cartridge at an office supply, and had no problems with the it at all. I would never buy another from this provider, and would not recommend anyone else doing so...this is the first time I have had problems using Amazon's recommendations. (This item was not a refill, by the way, but new.)NO STARS FOR A RATING, although review would not accept that with the review."
2,Not Apple Compatible!,"This camera seems really nice for the few days that I've had it. However, I am returning it because it is not Apple compatible. I-movie cannot edit the mpeg-2 files the camera creates so all the images are not editable. You can only watch them on an apple computer if you purchase a quicktime upgrade from apple, but the third party work-around that allows you to convert the mpeg-2 file to mpeg-4 results in a totally unacceptable degradation of image quality. I believe the Sony hard disk cameras have the same problem."
5,Wonderful camcorder!,"This is my 5th camcorder. Compare with vhsc, minidv, this one has best video quality, not to mention 30hrs tapeless storage capacity. I don't agree with the 1st reviewer on the focus, noise problems he/she reported. After using it for a week, I feel I should let others know the good thing about this camcorder. It defininately deserves a 5-star!"
5,A Rollicking Adventure through Japanese Culture,"Kriska's memoir starts out at an even pace and builds throughout the book. It intelligently criticizes Japanese (and, in many ways, American) culture, while silmultaneously retaining a deep respect for her second country. The book is fun, light on its feet, and extremely unpredictable. A great ride and a must-read before any American's trip to Japan!"
4,Now I realized how many mistakes I made while I was in Japan,"(I work for a large Japanese-owned corporation. Comments from a co-worker to whom I recommended this book...) One of the things I did while I was on vacation was read ""The Accidental Office Lady."" I loved it. Now I realize how many mistakes I made while I was in Japan. Oh well. I am circulating the book among the women in this office. Thanks for the tip."
4,Delightful...an American woman brings change to Japan,"I found Laura Kriska's book, The Accidental Office Lady, to be both delightful and informative.As the first American woman to work for Honda in Japan, her honesty and forthrightness served as a vehicle for change which might never have occurred without her impetus and perseverence. Honda employees owe her a debt of gratitude.Her experiences in Japan and her style of writing about them make this a book well worth reading!"
4,"Enjoyable, but there might be a discrepancy ...","I really enjoyed this book, and found it to be an interesting, useful, and above all, blessedly unsentimental (no sakura or lyrical descriptions of mountains, trees, or destruction thereof) book. However, since Kriska mentions that she joined up with Honda for a career, not a job, I wonder why her bio on the back cover describes her as a writer living in NYC ...."
5,Repalcement Springs 1989 Bronco,One of the very best prices that I could find on the web for a replacement spring for my 1989 Ford Bronco. I have used Moog products for years and trust their quality. Great fit. I couldn't believe how fast the new springs arrived.
3,Solid. Good. Interesting.,"If you are interestedsilent films you will enjoy this book. No doubt many readers will have a morbid interest in the protagonists' death and/or homosexuality. What struck me more interesting was the fact that Ramon dreamed his life away. The book is well written, seems to be solidly researched. I have one criticism. It seems padded. The book could have used an editor to strain away unnecessary detail that draws attention away from the central character."
2,This product does not arrive as I saw in the picture!,"This product does not arrive as I saw in the picture! as in the photo is black background and white came with me, I'm not happy with this product should deliver what they purchase or otherwise update the photos of the items."
1,defective,The Memory Card was defective as noted by the Game Cube pop-up message and would not work. If your need is immediate you may wish to order two.
5,YAY,"You suggested in the package that I write a reveiw, and I usually don't, but I'm very happy with product! Thanks for the memory card and your good service! :)"
3,Nintendo Gamecube Memory Card 251 - Corrupted from Start,"I just received this memory card, removed it from the packaging, and it does not work. My Wii says this Gamecube card is damaged and will not work. Disappointing. UPDATE: Amazon quickly replaced with a working card, and all works well. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Corrupted files,"I bought this memory card a few months ago and it worked fine the first time i used it. But the next time i tried to save my game the file was ""corrupted"". I didn't know whether it was something I did wrong at first so I deleted the corrupted file and started over again the next file was also corupted. So I played the gamecube game on my wii, because i thought it might be my gamecube that was broken still the memory card failed I've now tried several different games on it hopeing that was the problem, but no. This memory card is a peice of junk unless you like starting a new file every time you play. I would never recommend this memory card."
4,perfect,"i do only have a 59 memory card for gamecube and i think it is too few blocks, therefore im going to buy a big memory card"
5,Good Card Built very strong,Well im 13 and i got this memory card 2 years ago and its finally full thats two years of memory and that is because i put animal crossing on it it rocks its perfect if u play and buy alot of games like me ^_^
1,Buyer Beware!!!,If you're looking for a memory card this large made by Nintendo then keep looking. This is NOT made by Nintendo. Do not fall in the same hole I did unless this doesn't matter. They ought to be hit with false advertisement for using a pic of an actual gamecube package!!! BAIT AND SWITCH!!! Keep going!!!
1,not enough memory,"If you plan to buy it to save games like NARUTO, don't do it, it simply won't work."
5,Great Memory Card,"This memory Card arrived 1 day early and took only 2 days to arrive from the other side of the US. The memory card did have some minor scratches on it (it may be refurbished but I'm not sure) but other than that, it does its job like it should and worked great from the moment I inserted it in my Gamecube. So far I've had it for almost 2 days and it has been working properly (I'll update my review if anything changes) but I would recommend this memory card to people who have little to a medium amount of games since it has 251 blocks."
2,Not Enough Memory,"I have gone through two memory cards on the Gamecube in less than 4 years. The first was the memory 59, which was ridiculous, I managed to save 6 games on that one. Now the Memory 251, which I'll admit is an improvement as it is 4 times bigger. But in terms of megabytes, it's only TWO versus the Sony's industry standard of EIGHT. Nintendo's card is 4 times smaller! On the Memory 251, I have saved 3 EA Sports games. Which may sound good, but it's NOT. I've only managed to save the essential files to play the game. If I were to save all the files, I would only be able to fit one. I've also managed to save 5 other games. But now my memory card is full, and I don't want to purchase new games and a new card because of this.Nintendo has released the Memory 1019, which is equivalent to Sony's 8MB card. But Gamecube's life cycle is near it's end. Nintendo, another case of doing too little too late."
5,The only Memory Card to get right now,"It's about time we no longer have the 59 memory card. The 251 is the only place to go for memory. You can buy other brands now that offer a 251, but lets face it they are not Nintendo. You have to have a memory card to save your games and this is the best one out. I own a bunch of memory cards and they are all this one. I would't buy another one to save my games on. Well that is until they make a bigger one."
2,beware,there are pros and cons of this card.PROS-its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordableCONS-games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save!sometimes crashes.i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory. if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory card
1,Corrupted Card,"The card came completely full of files. I had to spend 10 minutes deleting everything. After the card had room, I tried it and it says that the card is corrupted. It won't work. I'm really disappointed. I'll have to order another one..."
4,Memory for Gamecube,I like this product a lot even though its used it works great and I love it I would buy it again and I think I will because I need another one soon!!! Thanks a lot for this!!
5,Good product that's worked fine,"I've had this memory card for over 2 years and it hasn't corrupted like other cards I have owned. In general, it's a great gamecube memory card."
3,Expensive memory card,"251 Is a lot more memory than the standard amount but this was pretty expensive. I bought a Mad Catz memory card as well for about the same price but with 1,019 blocks. Both are compatible with GCN and Wii. I purchased and started using each card more than a couple years ago. Neither has failed on me."
5,"New, original Nintendo equipment","This memory card arrived new in the box, exactly as shown in the picture. I've been using this card to save Gamecube games on my Wii without any trouble at all. The 251-block memory size is easily large enough for as many saves as I need. This item is well worth the purchase price."
3,It Works!,"I Got Harvest Moon About A Month Ago (It Came Quick By The Way) And I Was All Excited, I Put It In And Guess What?! ""Your Memory Card Is Full"" So I Ordered This Memory Card, It Also Came Thru The Mail Fast, And Thank Goodness! My Game Plays Now! So Yes This Memory Card Works Good I Guess. However, I Went To Play Mario Kart The Next Day, The Same Game I Have Had For Years, And It Said ""Memory Card Is Corrupted"" So All of My Unlocked Stuff Was Lost! But That Might Be The Other Memory Card Its Talking About Or Something I Dont Know What Happend Because My Other Game Harvest Moon And One Of My Other Games Works Fine! But I Haven't Played Any Other Of My Games Yet So They Might Be Messed Up Too. I Dont Know. But Anyway This MC Is Fine As Far As I Can Tell."
5,Perfect,Exactly what my niece wanted! It's perfect!!! We looked everywhere and this shipped on time and she loves it. I got the best aunt award lol
3,I felt ripped off.,"Well, I ordered the Gamecube w/Super Smash Bros. Melee, three controllers, and this memory card. The gamecube and controllers arrived yesterday, and still no sign of the memory card. I was pretty disappointed, since the three controllers came with the Super Saver Shipping, and I decided to pay extra for the memory card because I wanted it sooner. Now I'm regretting having had paid the extra shipping, since it would have been sent along with the controllers yesterday."
5,Great Deal,"This is not a Nintendo brand memory card, but is a great memory card. It is a 251 block and has served me well. Don't waste your money on a name brand one, this one will do just fine."
4,Very good wild game treat,"I have not had my own wild caught legs for years.These do not compare to those gems.I have purchased these a few times and will continue to,they are a good treat."
2,Not impressed,"Everyone is saying how great this is. Who are these people? This alblum is mediocre at best. DB's past cd's have all had a harder edge, so I was kind of looking forward to hearin something more downtempo from him. But his alblum is downtempo to the 10th power. The melody aint that bad, it's just the weak and spaced out beats. I could imagine my parents getting down to this stuff. Downtempo is ok, but you still need a little kick. . ..Oh, yeah, and the brownpaper bag mix on here is just the instrumental, no vocals, so don't be tricked if you look at the cd case and expect some kind of excitement."
5,amazing,"this is so great, its perfectly mixed and compiled. DJ DB is my hero. He has topped his last releases with this one, its such a great chill dnb album!!! amazingly beautiful."
2,I vowed no more Ikea. Ooops!,"This came from Canada. No mention of that anywhere. No big deal. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Covered in some kind of plastic black film. Edges are pealing up a little. No finished black wood. All particle board. Flimsy, loose. Zinc twisty contruction and assemly just like Ikea. Comes completely unassembled in two boxes. Good for a dorm. Won't last one move. The knobs are the nicest part of the whole thing. Bottom line, I keep it and learn a lesson: You get what you pay for."
4,Tiger Rocks,The graphics are great and the game is easy to learn. it offers hours of competitive golf
1,Crash City,I bought the Tiger 2007 game for the PC after playing the Xbox360 version. There is no comparison. The PC version contiously freezes my computer (which meets and exceeds the recommended specs) and was a waste of money. Sometimes it plays for 20 minutes without killing my PC (TOTAL FREEZE or shut down) and sometimes it just takes turning it on.I will never buy another EA game for the PC again.
5,Profound practical insight,"J. M. Farro demonstrates profound practical insight into our lives and the daily problems we face. She then relates them to the Bible, and how we can use God's Word to find answers and/or strength as we trudge through this life. Her insights include almost any possible event, problem, or difficulty we might be going through. She has two other books like this one; one for women, and one for men, which actually can be used by either. I love her writing style and her deep understanding of Scripture and how to find the answers to all questions in it."
3,ride it out,"It starts slow, but if you are into quirky movies, it's worth a rental. If anything, just watch it and see if you don't want to shoot his friend. Sadly, we all have friends like this.Peter Faulk is the one weak link, but Sean ""Puffy"" Combs is a natural in this ""down-wid-it"" character.Cool ending, too.Great soundtrack."
5,Visually stunning,"USAF is hands down the best looking flight sim ever created. The beauty of the scenery leaves you breathless as you soar through the plush clouds above Vietnam, Las Vegas, or Iraq. I've been a simmer since the release of gunship and stealth fighter on the commodore 64 (long time ago). Up to this point, nothing has even come close. The missions are somewhat boxed, but that isn't enough to take away the realism of the game. If your are a stickler for graphics as I am, This is the best game by far. It's definately a must buy for all simmers."
3,"Great When It Works, Maybe My PC Is Junk...","Seems cool, graphics were very nice. Although I experienced MASSIVE load time. Consequently, I lost interest. Control is pretty much the same as Israeli Air Force, but everything is MUCH better looking. Again, I can't say much, as my low-budget, no-name, brand-goes-out-of-business-as-soon-as-I-buy-it computer is too s--l--o--w when it comes to this one. Although, I must say the Vietnam missions in the F-105 Thunderchief were a gas, and blasting the poop out of Iraqi armor in A-10 Warthogs gave me a giggle or two."
4,fun and realistic,"This game is really cool. At first it was a bit tricky but after a few hours i got the hang of it. Some of the graphics are a little wimpy (mainy the ground is very grainy), but overall the graphics are good. The sound is excellent. Overall gameplay is great and lots of fun."
5,Awesome Song,"""Be My Last"" has got to be one of the best songs i have heard from her. Her voice is as good as it gets, and its not nosie sounding like Britney Spears or Ayumi Hamasaki. A good song thats really catchy. Get the video if you get a chance it is definitly interesting to say the least.:)"
4,Heartbreaking and haunting,"After the debacle that her English debut ""Exodus"" was, this song really showcased the true beauty and talent this Japanese singer/songwriter is all about. It does not take one to know the Japanese language to feel the longing and emotions invested into this song. ""Be My Last"" is a return to the days of ""Deep River"" with a new maturity gained from the lessons of her older works. The only fault I have with this single is that it does not include any remixes or instrumentals (unless you've bought the special cd/dvd one). Overall, a great piece of artistry!"
3,Weak Release,"'Be My Last' is the theme song for the Japanese film 'Haru no Yuki'. It's in a very different style than her previous works.This song is very minimal in arrangement, using basically only acoustic guitar and Hikki's voice. The composition is splendid and original, and Hikki sings beautifully as always.The downside to this release is that it only contains the title track. It doesn't even have an instrumental!It does, however, come with a DVD (Japanese DVD players only) that contains the music video."
2,Below par,"This song is just a cheesy-sounding run-of-the-mill ballad. I do not speak Japanese - hopefully at least the lyrics are worthy.In terms of sound, this is a far cry from Utada's ""Exodus"" or ""Single Collection"" albums that are far more interesting and involving. I have come to rely on Utada to rise above the average J-pop fluff, but this CD disappointed me."
4,PrEtTy GoOd,"the book was ok but I'm not really into historical fiction, I just needed it for a book report. but the book gave me LOTS of facz. a+ for me!!!!!!"
1,Herbal essences conditioner,"While the product was packaged in original looking container, it does not smell the same. I also was extremely stupid to pay so much for such a small amount. Fool me once"
4,Atlas of the First World War,"This book is a new (1994) edition of an earlier (1970) work. It depicts the war in maps and seems to cover all the important aspects of the conflict. The new edition boasts of 164 maps. There are large-scale maps showing entire theatres, and small-scale maps depicting towns. There is a strange map titled a ""London Gun Barrage, 1917"" that is difficult to decipher.One flaw of the book is its failure to take advantage of modern printing technology. Perhaps even in 1994 color reporductions were expensive, but the variety of shading and line drawings, all in monochrome, become monotonous and a bit irritating. Maybe a Third Edition will amend this issue.But the book tells the reader a lot of information that a serious student will appreciate. I recommend this book."
2,"Not much of an ""advantage""","The book is nicely laid out but the questions are not, I repeat, are NOT from the LSAT. To get the best preparation possible, get the real questions and drill. In fact, some of the questions in ""The LSAT Advantage"" leave room for multiple answers."
1,Not weird as much as goofy,"Kleinberg's book is more silly goofy and stereotypical of floridians. It wasn't funny or well written. I would recommend ""Weird Florida"" by Charlie Carlson instead."
5,strange state truley weird,found the book to be very funny. got a great laugh at the welcome to floirda sign :)
2,Not that great,"If you are looking for a good recording of Chopin classics, Roy Eatons Meditative Chopin will probably not satisfy you. He does not have very good command of his tones (especially in the e minor prelude, where every note seems to oscilate betwwen mezzo-piano and forte), distorts the rhythm with way too much rubato, and doesn't strike notes at the same time (he does it to be expressive, but in his case it is not a technique but a mannerism developed by years of poor practice). His rendition of the D-flat major nocturne is okay, and the music is relaxing, but as a classically trained pianist I recommend spending 10 bucks on something better."
1,Rip-Off,"MY fault. I thought the description said 702 pages; it said 702 words. I in fact had just read this exact ""book"" in Wikipedia.Wanting to know more about the individual, I saw this and thought it was a comprehensive biography with details of his philosophy and methods. I deserved what I got, since I was trying to avoid buying his books!!!!I bow to that old saying, ""Experience is a dear school, but a fool will learn in no other.""On the other hand, I learned the logistics of this service, and now have the beginnings of an online e-library, and that's worth the $2.50 right there.I am still in awe of the Internet and its powers, and of Amazon in particular."
5,I love this book,"This book is terrific for anyone who is either trying to learn more about their own behavior, or especially someone of Christian faith who is trying to connect their faith and their life. Very readable and a manageable length, this book points the reader toward a life of authenticity and loving. Using examples straight from the gospels, it paints a portrait of the human Jesus as a completely rich personality rather than the usual meek and mild stereotype - a personality to learn from. I highly recommend this book."
2,"I hope this edition would be more ""honest""","I've been collecting coins for over 10 years and I used 23rd Edition of Krause World Coins Catalog (1996). What can I say? There are too many coins for such a respectable edition missing in that edition, which were minted even in 1993! I just hope the present edition would be more ""honest"". Thank you."
1,Literary Stink Bomb,"I wouldn't recommend buying this book. The only books you should buy are those which can be read over and over again. This novel is not one of those books. It leaves the reader feeling cynically amused and that's about it. If that's the kind of feeling you're looking for then by all means, buy this novel and knock yourself out. By the end of the story you will have had your fill of cheap, regurgitated humor, so much so that you won't have to read a novel like this one ever again. Because, obviously, if you've read one of these trashy books, you've read them all."
1,"R.I.P., Loveless Monkey","As the New York Times and other prominent publications have noted recently, this awful novel died a quick death, flopping with readers and critics alike, failing at bookstores. I have to say, I read this book and can only agree. It wasn't just one of the worst books I'd read in 2004, but in my whole life this is in the worst Top 10. See you in the remainder aisles!"
3,not so so so bad,"LOVE MONKEY honestly could be worse. I don't think it was a total waste of my time. I do think I found myself scanning to the end beacause a friend reccomended it and gave me his copy over a month ago so I felt bad not finishing it. But not 'cause I wanted to . But I felt I had to write something here and that's this: If the six or seven very funny pages were folded down when you started reading it miiiight be worth it, but overall the writing is really stale and there is no plot or charachter that kept my interest. My definition of a beach read where you're not really paying attention anyway but want a laugh every once in a while."
3,Good novel; leaves you craving more...,"I initially saw this book at the store my wife works at, and honestly, I found a little of myself in the main character, so I bought it. After reading it through (and not wanting to give away too much of the storyline), I was left with a craving for more of the romance between 'Julia' and 'Tom'. The book ends on a sad note, and that was unsettling for me.Sure, there's the obscure semi-related story on 9/11, which was honestly only a point in one chapter, and we get a chance to see the main character develop from the self-proclaimed 'manboy' to a mature 30-something single guy, but I honestly felt sad when the book ended. I actually re-read one of the happier segments in the book to make myself feel better about the ending.I apologize for this review being brief, but I prefer to read reviews that don't give away everything in the book/movie. If you're interested, give this book a chance; don't be swayed by all the negative comments you may read...."
2,meh,"the main character repeatedly calls himself a ""manboy"", but the author went overboard trying to prove this. the writing comes off as immature and extremely chauvinistic.his overall prose style was okay. it was an easy read, but there was pretty much no plot. kind of boring, actually."
5,Loved it!,"This is the best book I've read in a LONG time. And I am a woman who did not find the main character at all annoying. Quite, the opposite--I thought he was charming, sweet and real. And I wanted him to get the girl really bad. But was also glad that it didn't end as simply as that. Now I don't know what the deal is with the amazon reviewer who trashed it, but it seriously must be some crazy who thinks they are a writer and is mad because Kyle Smith didn't review their book in People magazine or something. I mean, there is no need to be that nasty, it has got to be something personal against the author considering that the whole review is just sooooooooooooo off base. Anyway, this is a seriously good book, can't wait for the next thing Smith writes."
5,I want more.,"This is one of my five desert island books and I can't think of any higher praise than that. I laughed out loud on a regular basis, from the first page, Farrell had me. Tom Farrell is somewhat pathetic, but you still like him. He tries to get the girl and keeps you laughing. Even when tragedy strikes, you feel for him. His relationships with his friends parallel everyones, from the rich friend, the married couple and the girl who he ought to see for more. He captures the genre well and reminds us that the manboy still exists, whether we want to admit it or not."
1,"Boring, poorly written, and shallow","It was given to me as a gift from the bargain bin.The book had a ""play by the numbers"" storyline. I actually fell asleep reading it.As if the poor writing wasn't bad enough, the crappy book even left ink on my hands."
1,Monkeys in Love,"What did you expect? There are monkeys, they are in love, they are dope like the author, the piece of crap author who does not do any homework when reviewing movies. Whatever the price is for this trash, it is too high."
1,date from hell talks..........,"I don't like these ""lit"" books that are not good literature. These sort of books tend to have characters with no morals, are self-indulgent till you want to slap the writer. Just leaves me cold. His talent as far as prose is very good - he is quality writer, but this is just gash. His characters is everyone woman's worst nightmare. This dicklit is a dud.Sorry, give it a thumbs down and spend your money on something worth it."
4,Absolutely dead-on,"You know that guy who can do an entire conversation of Simpsons quotes? Or who knows all the names of the planets in Star Wars? This book is that guy.The plot left me a little bleh, but the humor sold me. There were some one-liners in there that I was laughing about for weeks. There is certainly nothing ""timeless"" about it. If anything, it probably won't make any sense to anybody in ten years. But I highly recommend it today!"
1,"SKIP THIS ONE IF YOU KNOW WHAT's GOOD FOR YA, FOLKS!","Love Monkey is a bad book by anyone's IMPARTIAL standards or reviews. Those who aren't objective have another agenda, but that's not for me to deal with; I'm just a big, well-read fiction luva who knows what is worthwhile. Actually you don't even need to have good taste to recognize that this novel lacks quite a lot. Not only is it one of the least amusing stories I have ever read, but the author just doesn't get you to care about the characters, because it's so clear he doesn't care for them himself. Taken entirely on its own terms, Love Monkey just doesn't hold up to a critical eye; it wobbles and crumbles into dust, as well it should."
1,An Emotional Wasteland,"I found this book to be a complete waste of time. The main character, Tom, is a shallow and immature character who evokes no response in the reader. I could neither like nor hate this character - rather I just felt very ambivalent about him and could have cared less about what happened to him. It took having the character experience 9/11 to make me feel anything at all while reading this book. An author should not have to rely on a horribly tragic event to evoke a response from his readers. Do not waste your time with this book."
2,Donating it to the local library,"I felt kind of embarassed buying this book, but I had to see what it was like. Well, I could kind of relate to what Tom was going through, but I found the writing to be too self-indulgent and Tom's interpretation of women a bit simplistic and misogynistic. Since I am too ashamed to have this novel on my book shelf I will donate it to the library."
1,PURE SWINDLE !,"Found this CD and WOW! I have non of these tracks on one of my over 150 Duke Ellington cds.Listened to it at Barnes and Noble.com and heard it did not sound as Ellington at all.Checked it out at: http://www.depanorama.net/dems/03dems1d.htm That's THE best Ellington site.And they wrote about this cd the following:Magnum CDMT 015""Keep it Movin' ""03/1 DEMS 24/1I found this CD which is exactly the same as the CD TKO ""Keep it Movin'"" TKCD010 as mentioned in DEMS Bulletin 98/2-16/3. Non of the 16 selections is an Ellington recording. Lars-Erik NygrenPLEASE AMAZON REMOVE THIS ITEM FROM YOUR CATALOG IT'S PURE SWINDLE!"
5,Excellent..,It was for a present for a friend and he was over the moon especially as it oly took a couple days to arrive and it travelled from America to England..
5,DIABLO 1,"I can't get enough of this game! It's really fun! I got it ""used"" and haven't had a problem yet. So far I'm at level eight, and am going further."
3,Diablo,If you like diablo 2 then you'll like diablo one or vice versa. Fun game a little gory at the end
3,old but yet still fun,i got this game when they came out with diablo two and i was disapointed by the spells and some other stuff but i found myself playing it a good amount and if you cant aford diablo 2 wich now probley doesnt cost much this is the right game.
1,This looks familiar...,"Okay, I'm about to make myself really unpopular here, but I just didn't like Diablo. I'm sorry, but I seem to remember a game called Gauntlet back in the mid-80s that offered this same gameplay. Don't get me wrong, Gauntlet was an okay game... for its time. Then Electronic Arts made a Guantlet rip-off called ""Demon Stalkers"" which offered the same gameplay but with a level editor. Well, Diablo doesn't even have that. Sure, the graphics are nicer now (though the colors are a little drab), and the music is better, but come on! The whole game consists of frantically clicking on sprites till they explode into a bloody mess."
4,blizzard,"great graphics, if u like those you should check out starcraft... blizzard is awesome for graphics on games..."
4,Great game but gets boring after a while,"When I first played this game i was amazed! This game was the best i had seen in a long time. The ai is ok but the best part of the game is the role-playing part of it. you have to go to town once in a while to get healed or to buy stuff. I reccomend only playing this game on multiplayer because single player isnt that good. But, after a while this game got extremely boring and it just seemed like a chore to play to me. i dont hardly ever play the game now but i might someday. but i reccomend you buy this game anyway because it is still a ... good game. it installs very easily and it will give you lots of hours of play for about 3 to 6 months."
2,Worthy of such praise?,"I must admit, the first two to five hours of playing this game I was addicted, but afterwards, when the quests were almost non-existant, when the environment ceased to change, when the game left a bland taste in my mouth, I found it to be a fruitless journey. The game got really old really fast. Aside from this, however, there was an abundance of items to be found, and I liked the music. However, these seemed to be the only two good things in this game."
5,"Get This Perfect Game, but Be Ready to Lose Sleep","Diablo stands alone - no other adventure roll-playing game comes even close.Everything about this game is just perfect - the graphics, the plot, the monsters, the setting, the music - everything. The only thing bad was that the game does end, leaving you with a serious post-partem depression that can be cured only by Diablo II."
4,Most addictive RPG Game forever!,"Extremely addictive ...... I bought it because my cousin also owned and said that is fun and great(Good Play????Cantonese?) , when I insert the disc to the drive......a ""HAHAHA......"" sound comes out.......! Well , this game is extremely addictive , you will spend hours and hours to play , kill and heal , so perpare some stuffs such as coffee and concentrated tea....... This game maybe can play unlimited times........the world of diablo randomly generates every time you play a new game , so don't think that this is a bore game~ Warning : If you are still a child , if you are not dare enough , then better don't play this game , the blood and damned dead bodies.......not suitable for Child...........~ The Multiplayer game is more addictive ! Try ! But beware of PK!(Player Killers)They may kill you if you are newbie or beginner!!"
2,Too maze-like with not enough up-close detail.,"I'm an action fan and I love games like Final Fantasy 7, Duke Nukem 3D, etc., but there just wasn't enough detail with the surroundings in all those dungeons and labyriths.Everything was too small on the screen, the charaters, even the biggest monsters. At least in Duke Nukem, the surroundings are more real-life. Yes, it's somewhat exciting with plenty to monsters to slaughter, but it just goes on and on. All those mazes were too intellectual for me to enjoy any excitement. It's dark and you're always trying to find your way out, etc. Also, the music and theme of the whole game in general is dark and depressing. And like I said before, there's not enough detail with the graphics and characters. I like Duken Nukem 3D because it's more close up. Even 'Quake' is more detailed than this game.Thank you."
3,Great price but unable to play.,"Unfortunately the game would not play correctly on my PC. It did load, but the video graphics were all reversed and unusable."
2,Single Player is fantastic.. but..,"Single player is fantastic, but playing Diablo online (multiplayer) is terrible. Cheaters and hackers have ruined online gameplay, the only way to survive is to cheat as well (godmode+more). It's not much of a game after that. Good News though, Diablo II should be cheat/hack free."
5,watch your back,"This game is a lot of fun. It is even more fun (and less scary) if you play it with a friend. If your friend is Joe the ""Duke of Winona"" you best be watching your back though. Joe like to play the rogue and Joe isn't fussy about who he shoots his arrows at. I can't count the number of times my character lay dead beside chest, back full of arrows while Joe jumped up and down beside me yelling ""Yahoo! More Loot!"" He wasn't careful about drinks on my new sofa either.uncareful + new loot = spilly joeOne time he even broke some wooden lizard I brought back from Mexico. It was hanging on the wall and he was a bit dizzy on account of too many beers and it being way past the time he usually retires for the night and he bumped into it and it fell.Another thing Joe does is hang back a lot. I'd call him ""old hang-back joe"" because he'd wait for you to clear out a room and when you're standing there trying to catch your breath, in he'd sweep and collect all the loot."
2,Boring times 5,"Don't let this game fool you with all the awards its won because i think the judges might of ben on .... This game is boring and it has the same old stuff over and over and it seems like it never stops and its a waste of time, money, and headaches.Kids do not buy this game uuumk"
3,It keeps going and going and going...,I thought this game really had no point. It just kept doing the same thing. Every level was the same it just didn't change. I mean it had great graphics and all but it just puts you to sleep it is so boring.
4,Nethack with Graphics,"Not to put too fine a point on it: this game is essentially a shallower, real-time version of Nethack, a game with roots stretching back 20 years to older computer games like ""Rogue"" or ""Beneath Apple Manor"". (You can find the freeware Nethack easily on the web.)However, it =is= a particularly solid implementation, with excellent music, graphics (for the time, they're somewhat outdated now), sound effects, voice-acting, and (most critically) a decent interface. The story is more or less irrelevant, but it serves.This is a fairly short game with a fair amount of replayability. There's not much brain-strain nor is there much of a learning curve. Reccommended."
3,"Diablo...The Lord of Terror returns, or rather, begins","First of all, this game is great. I really enjoy it. However, it is a little tedious at parts, and sometimes the guys outpower you (DON'T be the sorcerer starting out), but the game is good. If you like Dungeons & Dragons, this game is really similar, only it doesn't take hours to get through 1 level of a dungeon. There's some great items, you can interact with the characters really well, and the items and weapons are fabulous.I gave this 3 stars only because I made a bad mistake...I played Diablo 2 first. I was REALLY disappointed that it wasn't as good as it. I know it's unfair to make judgement on one game based on it's sequel, but if you have Diablo 2, or are thinking of getting it, play Diablo FIRST, or don't play it at all.Good luck, and have fun!"
4,Fun Game!!,Diablo is a good game. I have played it for hours at end even though the game gets repetitive after some time. It's worth it's price!
4,"Simple, dark, compelling","Sometimes you just need to whack things around. Storyline? Who cares? Plot? Who needs it? Gimme a sword and a healing spell, some monsters to bash, and I'm happy as a clam at high tide. When I feel that way, there's only one place to turn, and that's Diablo.While later games have improved significantly on the user interface Diablo pioneered, this is certainly still a playable piece of work four years after its release. I find myself trying to get to the Previously Visited Places menu from Darkstone at least once per hour, but I can live with that. Diablo's atmosphere is dark, almost palpably creepy. That's not something that's easy to do to someone who's staring at a computer monitor.If you don't have Diablo yet, what are you waiting for? At its new bargain price, it's one of those games that should be in the collection of every gamer."
3,"Yep, I've played it and can't think of a better title","Enjoy this one thoroughly. However, graphics aren't nearly as detailed as other games I've played; bird's-eye view is limiting, and the sorcerer character has no chance in hell of surviving past the first levels to where his abilities could be considered an advantage. The Rogue and the Warrior are great fun, however, and the game can be played over and over before it begins to be dull."
3,An updated Ulitima VIII - Pagan,I am an on again off again gamer. So I went back to pick up Diablo which seems to blow everyone's mind. I don't get it. The graphics and game play are about on par with Ultima VIII which was released in 92 or 93.
5,cool game,ya diablo is great game it took me about 2 weeks to beat it.The only bad thing is the graphics.P.S lazurus and diablo are both easy to beat but guys aroung him are hard.
1,...,I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS GAME AT ALL! IT WAS WAY TOO FANTASY-BASED! DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE GAMES THAT ARE EVEN SLIGHTLY REALISTIC!
4,works great!,Serves the purpose I needed. Installation was time consuming but easy to follow if you have the correct tools.
1,JUST GOT AHOLD OF A BAD ONE,"FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING! NEITHER OF THE CARTRIDGES WOULD PRINT ANYTHING BUT PINK! PURCHASED NEW CARTRIDGE LOCALLY, AND I WAS OFF AND RUNNING IN FULL LIVING COLOR!"
4,More space then you need,"The quality of Sandisk flash memory is superior. Durable, fast transfer speed. The most I like about this product is the memory size of the Micro SD. I use it as storage of music on my PDA phone, with 3.80GB actual space, who still need to carry an i pod around."
2,Got a 4g surprise,"Ordered this unit as a suggesttion from the web site here as my LG800G tracfone would support this memory card. Phone wouldn't recognize the card, but my computer would while installed in the phone. Ordered another 4g SanDisk card from McTechy,(another shipper) through Amazon links. It works like a champ. Don't know what's up there. Still can't go wrong for the price."
3,Don't Try To Defrag It !,"This was a replacement media card I bought for a new Blackberry Pearl 8100. My previous unit was stolen. I had bought a 2GB from a T-mobile store which formatted and defrag-ed without incident. Now for this new unit I purchased one from Amazon.com (4GB). It formatted fine but when I tried to defrag it for some reason its not recognized on my phone. I have to remove it, put ALL my music and movies back on the card. That's a hassle ! But other than that, it works fine. So lesson learned! Defragmenting is not always a good thing !"
4,Very hand and comes with SD Adapter,"I got this for my new tracfone, and it works well. I enjoy the fact that it comes with an SD Adapter, so I can just slide it into my SD slot on my computer and transfer any information needed. It is very easy to put the card into the adapter. I enjoy having the memory card, it allows me to store my music on it and play it through my phone."
5,Great Bargain,"great product...works as advertised and it's a Sandisk. Can't go wrong at this price plus, the product is of good quality."
2,Shipping Charges a Rip-Off,"The reason I'm giving this card a low rating is not because it's a bad card, but it's because of the shipping costs that sellers charge. I ordered one of these a while ago, but had to return it. I pay less than a dollar for shipping. It's about the principle in the end. Economically speaking it's all about the trade-off. You might be getting a cheaper card all in all with the shipping included, but what's ridiculous is how the sellers lie about the shipping costs.SD cards barely weight anything, so go check the rates that USPS offers for items that are less than a pound. You can even return this item with regular postage mail. If you buy this item then you're falling for the seller's trick. The charge a relatively small amount for an SD-card, and retrieve the rest from the abnormally large shipping cots for such a small item."
1,"slow delivery, incomplete order, did not rec'v the adapter, only the SD card - won't order from this supplier again","did not rec'v the adapter as specified in the description, only the SD card - luckily, I had an adapter already at home so I could still use the SD card. The item was ordered on 9/17, ETA was 9/23. as of 9/27 still had not recv'd package ... contacted supplier to let them know, they sent me an RMA number to return the product that I NEVER RECV'D! ????? hello!?!?!?! granted, the delivery issue was probably UPS's fault but, I was already pretty upset about not yet recv'ing the product, then to get an RMA # to return something I didn't have and THEN to not get what I ordered .... yeah, won't order from this supplier again ..."
1,Fake card & charged double shipping,"I bought two of these from the seller. One was real, and the other a fake. I was charged S & H on both, even though they were going to the same place."
5,dawilmer,exelente vendedor muy responsable muy puntual a la hora de enviar el producto gracias el producto es de exelente calidad lo recibi tal cual como decia en la presentacion. espero seguir haciendo negocios con ustedes.
2,Micro SD card,Both card adapters fell apart when installing the micro SD card. I have not been able to get the micro cards to work so I rate these cards as either knockoffs or poor quality items. I will not purchase from this supplier again.
1,How can you mess up something so simple???,"They sen't me a SD card for a Digital Camera, instead of the one I needed for my cell phone. You'd think a place that sells this stuff on a regular basis would have noticed the big diffrence between the two items. The one is 3-4X bigger than the cell phone SD card. Waste of $$$, and a headache I'll never deal with again. FAIL!"
1,missing adapter,when i rec'd the disk it was not in the plastic container it was just loose in the box and the adapter was missing
2,Price is right but,Arrived on time. Bought it for use in my Cell recognized product but there was no improvement in game play. Kept it because of low price. Probably the phone.
1,NOT SANDISK,This is NOT a SanDisk memory card. It is an approximately 4GB card (although it shows less capacity than the other 4GB SanDisk cards I have - 3760 and 3768 vs the SanDisk cards at 3773 MB). The included adapter is labeled SanDisk.
1,Never Received It!,"I would love to write a review for this memory card, but I never received it. And I've yet to receive a reply to my inquiry about the delay... Will NOT be purchasing from this seller, again.UPDATE: Finally received it. Love the memory card, but will not shop with Superior Electronics, again. Ever. It was a great hassle trying to get through to Superior Electronics. Wound up waiting for it to arrive, as though it was the first time I ordered. Even went so far as to ask me to remove this review, BEFORE the problem was resolved. I recommend Sandisk memory, but warn against patronizing Superior Electronics..."
3,i need help,"i just got the memory card today and already downloaded music onto it with my laptop and i inserted it into my phone but its not reading any of the music.i doubled checked if the music is on the card.. i re inserted it back into my comp. and it shows the music.the phone i have is at&t; tilt 2 and i read online that this model of phone is compatible with microSDHCand i put the card in the right way, and turned off my phone twice.so can someone help me out and give me instructions on how to do this, i really dont want to waste my time and ask the company and wait a week to get a email back.. lolwell, thanks..."
1,POOR Customer Service,"I ordered a memory card and paid extra for expedited shipping. The seller claimed expedited shipments would take 1-3 days. Once the order posted, the estimated delivery date was 8 days after the order date!! I emailed the seller to ask about this and my order was immediately cancelled by the seller without any response. Absolutely ridiculous!"
3,cd jamaica,I bought this product for my Blacberry Pearl however it cannot read this device.Works well in other devices.
2,card has damage,i received it DOA and sent it to SanDisk for a new one through RMA and shipping was insanely slow
5,4 GB Micro,Ordered. Shipped. Recevied. Price was right. Works like it's suppose to in my phone for MP3
3,Works.. But..,"Like some persons were saying but I never really understood some devices might are not able to handle this new technology I have a LG Shine Bat it wasn't able to- So I switched and gave ma Bro this and took his 2gb instead. Try and find out what your device is compatible w/. I emailed the company that supplied this, they were helpful."
3,Good news and bad news,"Well I bought this card because it was 4 gigs, however for lack of research on my part. I didn't realize the Tmobile Dash was only capable to use up to 2 gigs. Still a great deal. I just popped it into a usb memory card reader and use it as a flash drive."
4,Good deal but I can't use it :(,"I have an LG ENV, this card won't work in it :(Card must be a microSDTM so be forewarned ENV owners."
5,Works great in ATT Tilt 8925,Hardest part was figuring out which way is up. Card was recognized immediately after cold boot and now doing it's job.
5,Great Product!,It was a great and inexpensive thank you so much! Came in a good amount of time and was in new condition as said! I would recommend this to other.
4,Quick Service.,"Received the Card very promptly.I used the adapter To try out in my camera but got""card error"" message.I then used it in my GPS to download new maps & it appears to work in that.Although I havent used the GPS yet all seems to be ok.The adapter seems bad so wont be able to use as a regular sd card.The card was shipped promptly & received long before the estimated time of arrival.The price was a good deal also."
2,80% failure rate,"I ordered 3 of these cards, which were supplied by the AGFA Store. One worked just fine, the other two returned a ""Card Error"" message as soon as I inserted them into the recorder. When I finally received replacements, they didn't work either. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I won't be ordering any more of these cards from this supplier."
5,It works!,"It works for me... I mean, it's just a storage disk. I can't figure out what else to say about it."
5,compatibility,this micro sdhc is not for use on psp go or psvits systems. some cell phones are also not compatible with this card. please refer to your product user maual before buying this card. if you are not shure you should contact the product's company for advice and compatibility list. you may also be able to find and buy a card reader for this and use it without the adapter but i still recomend you have one just in case you need it down the road.
4,good storage,"I put this in my phone to access photos. More than enough storage for what I need but when I insert the card into the SD adapter and try to read it in my computer, it does not recognize it. Perhaps the phone has a dedicated file system that prevents it being read by my OS."
4,good product with limited use.......?!,it is a good product if you get it for less than $10.working effectively...till nowcons: No USB card reader.. it limits its usage.Its a big disadvantage.we can't use it with desktop.working is superb..
5,Works Perfectly,"I got this for my Casio Exilim Cell phone, and it fits perfectly into the slot for it, and it works great!. I'm really glad I got this micro SDHC card."
5,Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC,"Standard Micro SDHC Memory 4GB, Works well for Cellphones and other portable devices, SD adapter makes hooking it up to the computer simple and fast, no need to deal with USB cellphone to computer hookups."
3,ok,This product does what it is supposed to and is reliable as long as it is treated properly. It seems recommendable.
5,excellent price and product,got a call phone missing the memory card this worked great holds tons of music and photos plus can slide it right in the laptop
3,NOT SURE ABOUT THIS,"I have yet to use the memory card. I can't seem to find how to use it with this phone. It fits perfectly in the phone and shows up on the home page, but getting to it has been impossible thus far. Maybe I could get some help with this feature."
5,Good,Good product. Good everything. Will recommend for other people. We are very happy with it. Have a very nice day.
1,This was horrible,"i cant really review it because i never got the thing, i sent an email to bluproton and they never sent anything back to me i forgot about it of course i never really needed it in the first place but oh well just horrible though get an 8gb+ they are much better"
5,hard to beat the price,"Worked fine in mp3 player as micro sd card, and just as well in laptop when placed in SD adapter."
4,"Perfect, just perfect","It was just what I needed. Found instructions online on how to install it in my phone, but it was really simple. Gives me plenty of space to store apps, pics, and mp3."
4,Finally I get it,"I have been waiting for a month to get the item.I guess the first item they shipped to me is missing on the half way, dam USPS. So I send an email to the selling, and they are very concern and very helpful. They promise to send me again. Now I finally have it."
2,Do NOT buy this item!!!,I just recieved this item for my Sony Ericsson Z750a and it doesn't even fit! I have read everything about the memory card that is capable with my phone and this memory card is but it doesn't fit at all!!!
5,Great fit,Perfect sized storage at a more tan delightful price. I will buy more in larger memory size as well as more of the same..
3,Haven't used it.,"Received in a timely manor. Thought is was needed for the trafone I purchased, but don't see where it can be used. Can't fairly rate."
5,Memory is memory,Memory is memory. This was inexpensive at the time I bought it and works well. Bulk packaging is of little concern. It helps to keep the cost down and makes for a greater value.
1,Not with BB Curve 8310,"Someone on this board said it worked with the 8310, but when I tried to format the card it froze the unit. Every time. Had to remove battery. No idea why."
5,Very happy with product!,I got this for my blackberry to be able to take more photos. I inserted it and it worked immediately. Great product.
5,Great!,"Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC (MicroSD High Capacity) Memory Card (SDSDQ-4096-E11M, Retail Package)Works great with my Sprint Mogul nothing to do but insert and add your favorite videos,pictures or music and very quick shipping thanks again"
3,better now,At first time of purchase I had to return the product back to the seller. So a replacement was sent and now everything is cool. Just doing what it was created to do.
1,wrong size,it did not fit in the mp3 player that i brought for my husband and that is all i have to say
5,It's a micro world!,"I bought this for my LG800. 1st installation didn't work--there was an ""X"" over the icon. Took it out and put it into my cardreader and the computer picked it up just fine. I was able to transfer files from my computer to the card but the phone wouldn't read from it. So I put it back in the cardreader and formatted it. After that, the X was gone and the card was usable on my LG800."
2,Only MP3 EPG Music allowed!,"This product does not allow any type of music to be downloaded execpt for mp3 epg music [ Music downloaded from Itunes or Frosrtwire ] if you buy an album from an artist [ Example: Lil Wayne, Adele, Justin Bieber, Elton John, ETC ] it does not load onto the SD card. If you buy an album from the store and put it on your computer you can't load that music on the Micro SD card. If the only music you have is from Itunes or Frostwire then this is a great great buy."
4,COMPATIBLE WITH LG500G,Bought two of these bulk/oem micro memory cards. LG500g cell phone displays less than 4gb on card. Also bought one of the retail microsdhc cards for twice the price and I prefer it because it has full 4gb and a 5-year warranty.
5,SanDisk 4 GB microSDHC card,"Great price, fast delivery, Good product. I installed this in my cell phone (LG 800G) and it works with no issues. I didn't even need to format it."
4,Micro Memory!,"This technology is wonderful, but it's incredibly easy to lose track of where you put place it. I had one that I had stuck in a device and I had to pry it out and it stopped functioning afterwards, so these aren't the most durable pieces of memory. It fits in its adapter perfectly, but be careful of the other devices that are testy with it. It reads/writes just as fast as any other normal media storage devices and it may be the future of micro mobile storage."
5,It is working as indended,"The 4GB card works great in my Garmin 60csx. My ""legacy"" card reader will not read a card larger than 2GB because of the file system the cards use so I do not have that option. I can load the card directly into the gps from my computer."
4,Make sure your device can read it!!,"I have a Blackberry Pearl, and along with a number of other devices, it can't read these cards!! The card itself works fine with my Canon SD800iS camera (with the adapter), but even then I cannot download it to my G5 Mac through my card reader. The technology is very new, and not all devices support it, so double-check before you buy. If your device does work, I recommend this product 100% - the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because there was no warning when I bought it."
5,Micro sd card,Item arrived earlier than expected and in good shape. I was glad it came with the adapter card. Makes it easier to transfer the pictures.
5,Works very good,It works like charm. By default no issues. I would recommend buying whole case than just buying micro card so that It can fit in camera and card reader in laptop. Worth for money.
3,Works fine.,I used it for internal memory for my phone. Worked great until my phone broke and had to replace it. Too bad I forgot to take out the card when I had it replaced..
2,Doesn't work in an R4 card,I bought this to use in a R4 card. I copied everything that was on the current micro SD card to this and put it in the R4 card. The Nintendo DS gives an error message about not being able to read the hardware. I'm very disappointed.
2,just okay,"It didn't work with all my electronics. Was unable to use it for my phone, but use it now for my camera, but can't be read with my computer's card reader, so have to hook up the camera to the computer. Yeesh. Bottom line is I do use it, but wouldn't order it again."
5,Worked great!,"This little card is great, came in the mail popped it in my LG Shine and ta da! Now I can load it it up with some music and use for pictures."
2,Failed to work properly in my Sansa Fuze,"This chip pretty much functioned properly 90% of the time in my Fuze, but hung the unit and resulted in errors during playback and deletion. About 2 or 3 times per day. Oddly enough, I even got the errors on the unit's internal memory as well.I removed the chip and the Fuze once again works flawlessly. It appears that it caused no permanent damage to my device.I took a nine-dollar chance and it didn't pay off this time. I am still waiting to hear from the vendor that sold me the chip."
5,GOOD BUY,"WITHOUT THIS EXTRA MEMO MY PHONE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FUNCTION THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO FUNCTION. SO FAR I AM PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT, AND IT ARRIVED A FEW DAYS BEFORE I HAD ANTICIPATED, THAT WAS THE ICING ON THE CAKE FOR ME."
3,check compatibility,"Arrived as speedy as Amazon always delivers, and at a great price. However, the product I purchased this for only supports a maximum of 2gb, and it wouldnt even recognize the 4 gb card at all."
1,Doesn't Work,"This Doesn't work, no package, looks fake brand. none of my cell phones work and cameras, all my sd card readers can't read it."
1,waist of time,"I got this to go with my phone, sadly it only works with 1% (according to the people that sold it to me) of devises at this time, something that they failed to mention."
1,sucks it never came to me,i bought this item and it never came to me i had a refound but it sopose to come in 90 days i will never buy from this seller agan
1,Not good.,Be careful with this memory card and adapter because it cant be read by some laptops (i tried in several toshiba) nor pda or cell phones.
4,value,cant't really give a good review on this i purchased it to help with memory and haven't needed it yet
1,they stole my money,"it only work for 2 days, i have tried to use it in other devices and i didnt get any results. finally ill have to trow it to the garbage can."
1,Great price...until it didn't work.,"I bought this Sandisk micro SD for my Garmin GPS.What a deal! $4.............Until it didn't work.I went to Office Depot, paid $17 for the same thing, and it worked fine.Live and learn."
3,Micro plash memory card,The card arrived as promised and it works fime. I purchased it for a specific device that uses this micro card. I wish that manufacturers would stick with a more managable size memory card.
3,Adapters did not work,I bought two of these Memory cards that worked but neither of the adapters that you use to plug into the card readers worked. I had to buy a separate card reader for it from office depot.
2,Problem adapter,I got this for my new phone. The card seems to work fine but the adapter doesn't. It has a switch on the adapter that is supposed to allow the card to be locked (read only) or unlocked (read/write). The card is locked whenever it's in this adapter no matter how the switch is set. Look it up on the web and you'll see lots of people having this problem with their sandisk adapters. Some can fix them with tape and other tricks but the fact is the adapters aren't working right.Sorry I paid more for the Sandisk name.....
5,Awesome!,"The product works excellent, for both camera & cellphone. I really got what I wanted for a good price, it was definitely a great deal!"
1,Defective,The SanDisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card (BULK Packaging) did not work in my Samsung phone. I called AGFA and they were nice enough to immediately send me another. Second one did not work.They finally sent me another in a sealed SanDisk packaging and it worked perfectly. I learned a lesson to not order anything when it says: Bulk Packaging.
5,"Very inexpensive, arrived very quickly, in good shape, working.","I ordered two of these little 4GB wonders at $3.27 w/$0 Shipping and Handling from eTech, for a total of $6.54. I ordered on a Monday, and got them on Thursday.Plugged straight into my phone and my Nook, and worked right away.Both came with an SD adapter, inside a little plastic box for both the MicroSDHC card, and the SD adapter.No problems at all!Very pleased with my purchase, would buy again, would recommend.Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter (BULK Packaging)"
4,No problems works great!,Good price and works great! Use in my cell phone and it does what it suppose to do. Good buy!
5,I saved $$$$$$,"I have a Garmin nuvi 1450 and when I was loading the 2013 updates, I got a message that the unit did not have the required memory. Garmin suggested that I purchase a 4GB to add to the unit at $15., add shipping, $21.00 total. Garmin suggests that their 4GB is the only one that will work. They don't tell you that the SanKisk Micro for $5.00 will work just as well. On the Garmin nuvi 1450 there is a micro disk slot on the right, top, side of the unit and the SanDisk snaps in. I went to the Gamin download page and the SanDisk was excepted. I saved $15."
5,Good buy,"This is a good price , but other places are equally as good. xxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxx xxx xxx x"
4,sandisk card and adapter,"i was blown away by the amount of space for phone photographs. some 21,300 pictures. awesome storage capacity. i would certainly buy another one if i need it. great price and service. thanks"
5,Just What I Orderd,Good Card Formated Out To 4 GbLike The Card A Lot Had FunHad It For A Blackberry AndWorked Fine :) A+++
5,Sandisk 4GB Micro SDHC memory card,"This memory card works just fine in my Samsung SGH-S390G Tracfone. And with the adapter, I can plug it into my MAC & download pictures. It is very small & takes a little practice to be able to insert & remove it from the phone - so don't get to heavy on it."
5,Great for Garmin 1350,"Bought this micro SD Card for my Garmin nuvi 1350 because I did not have enough space to update the new maps. This micro SD card works great, and I now have enough memory to be up-to-date with the maps. Great shipping time and product quality, at least until now."
4,GOOD STORAGE,THIS DISK IS THE BEST IN DATA STORAGE. I USE THESE UNITS ALL THE TIME. I HAVE DOCUMENTS STORED ON THESE DISK FOR FUTURE USE.
1,Does Not Come with Adaptor as stated.,"The micro disk works great but luckily I already had an adaptor because it didn't come with on as stated in the ad. If you don't need the adaptor, this is a good deal."
4,Better deal anywhere hands down!,this is a great product and would recommend it if you need to back up a lot of data. I use if for my music on my phone and now i don't have to carry my mp3 player along with my phone. I can just have one and carry my favorite music. oh and don't forget the price. a lot of places this card is really expensive.
5,"Solid product, good price.","Nothing to complain about this Micro card. It works as you'd expect it to with no issues. There were some minor issues, but really the seller had great communication and took care of me along the way. I recommend it..."
5,Works on the Cingular 8525 with WM6,"I updated my Cingular 8525 WM5 to WM6, so I bought this Micro SD praying it will work with my phone, and it did!!!Lots of storage, no problem what so ever."
2,False advertising,"The SDHC cards are not from Sansa (as shown in the image and item title). So a bit of false advertising is involved. The cards work fine, but I expect quality control is not as good as might be found in a name brand. I certainly don't appreciate buying what I thought was name-brand but which is actually 3rd party."
5,Just right!,This memory card is just as described and works like a charm. I wouldn't hesitate to order again should the need arise.
5,"Great product, great Service.","I ordered two of these - one for my boyfriends Pearl, and one for my Curve. They arrived several days early, and were precisely as described. They were very simple to install, precisely as any other MICRO SD would install - they are so terribly tiny, however, so if you try to slam them into your phone by force - why yes, they probably will break. Right in half.Both phones recognized these products immediately, and both laptops did as well (MacBook Pro and MacBook).So overall, great product, good price, great shipping. Go for it."
5,Good product - slow USPS delivery,"This was exactly the product I needed for my ATT Blackjack II phone. It is TINY - but having an additional 4GB of memory for music makes this a great buy.As for the seller - great product, great price, fast response to E-mail inquiries. Unfortunately, USPS let me down (10 business days to send from Florida to Michigan on priority shipping) and Iw ould strongly recommend upgrading shipping if you order."
4,Satisfactory Customer,Promised product and I got micro card and container for it to connect to laptop.I did so much of search to buy cards and stuff like that but reviews had shaken my confidence. But this purchase did not disappointed me.
4,Good things do come in small package.,"Wow its amazing how small a space you can cram 4GB of data into. You could hide this thing under a fake thumb nail.And you can get larger GB size 16,32,64 GB but it is the same size outside. How cool is that? You can put alot of data on 4GB. Music,video,text. For less than $5 with shipping I am amazed at what $5 can still buy. Works perfect. My phone sucked it up like candy, was an easy install. And my win 7 desktop auto created a folder for the phone and a mass strage device. I ordered on thursday after 5pm and it was in my mail box the next tuesday before noon. And it works great! Would be worth 10,15,20 dallars to me retail. You cant go wrong for less than $5. But it dont come in a retail package. Its a split bulk lot -into 1 unit packaging . You will get a first class envelope with no insutions or documents or retail packageing. Just a working SD card. Works for me! I dont need the fluff I just wanted the card."
4,Well it works,Product works fine but the adapter that it comes with to fit a regular SD card only works part of the time. Not a huge problem except I bought it because I lost my adapter and needed a new one! Oh well couldn't beat the price.
5,Perfect.,I bought this to put music and store more pictures in my cell phone. It works like a charm. Absolutely no complaints. Also was a no brainer for the price I paid compared to buying it at any store.
2,There was no SD Adapter.,"But I didn't give a s***, because I only paid 5 dollars for the card in the first place.The card works great in my GPS, I'm just a little burnt over not getting the SD Adapter."
1,Didnt work,Didnt work. I bought this with my daughters phone for extra memory and the crda did not work so now I have to purchase another one.
4,Pretty Nice :),"Received in mail a few days before estimated arrival which was nice. Came in small packaging which contained the shipping info, Micro SD card w/ adapter which were both in a case. Upon popping it into my computer I found that the SD card would not accept me to copy paste my songs. Upon further inspection I found a small lock on the side of the adapter that I was using. Switching this off seemed to alleviate my problem, anyways the file transfer was a breeze after that. I am using this for a phone and it sorted my songs in a weird order, so I went back into the card and found that putting your music in the ""Sounds"" folder automatically puts them in a comprehensive order. To top it off, this is a nice card for the price, albeit with a few user complications ;). Overall pretty good. 4/5"
2,Not recognized,"DOES NOT work with an HTC Excalibur...at least not with mine. It recognizes the 1gb version just fine, but not his one. The 4gb is recognizable by my computer, but not my phone, which is what i bought it for. i am disappointed."
3,4GB micrSD,Nice 4GB storage. Bought it for my PDA phone but the 4GB will not read in my device. I guess it only reads up to 2gb. But I can still use it for my coputer. Never knew there could be so much storage space in a microsd card.
4,Works Perfect on Windows 7,"The reason I purchased this item was to add memory to my cell phone (enV2 by LG). When I first purchased it I was running Windows XP, and it did *not* detect the card as a device. I didn't want to look for drivers, and stashed the card in a drawer.A few months later, after getting a new laptop with Windows 7 pre-installed, I decided to try the card again. It worked perfectly on the first try and is fairly fast to transfer a few gigs of music and pictures.In short, it does what I need it to, but use Windows 7 opposed to Windows XP. I haven't tested with a Linux host yet."
5,SanDisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card-Awesome,I got this thing in 2008 so I know i'm really late for making a review about this memory card. Ok so after the day i got it till now I am really happy about this micro memory card. I use it on My Sansa 4GB Fuze. So now it gives me a total of 8GB. So thats pretty good. I haven't completely filled it up yet. I like the adapter card it comes with. So it can be played on a PC or any device that can read this card. Overall it a good micro SDHC memory card and worth the price.
3,Acceptable.,I absolutely loved the space on this little card which makes me able to carry alot of stuff around. What I absolutely hate is the adapter which dosent work very well. So I had to sync all my music thru the windows media player and it took forever. The adapter dosent work very well with all brands of laptops I guess. But that dosent deter me from buying another when I need one knowing how to do it now.
1,Deceptive advertising by the seller ??...or just plain greedy,"OMG...I placed 16 of these cards in my shopping cart, went to check out & was STUNNED to see the shipping (US address) was $72!! That's almost $5 @ card. Mind you, the total order probably weighs less than 1 pound, and they want $72 to ship it! Why don't they just advertise the cards to cost $1 each, then tack on $20 @ card shipping? This smells of deceptive advertising to me.Thanks, but no thanks. For the same price, I went elsewhere & bought my 16 cards & received Class 6 cards, instead of these lowend Sandisk Class 2 cards."
1,SATISFIED,I AN ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH THE SANDISK I PURCHASE THEY DO THE JOB I ENTEND FOR THEM TO DO. WHERE EVER I USE THE SANDISK IT ALLOWS ME THE SPACE THAT I NEED FOR THAT ITEM.
1,Outrageous Shipping!!!,"Roughly $6 each for shipping? That's not right. I ordered 6 of these and got billed more for shipping than the product. They don't bother to tell you they consider each card an item. Really, how much more does it really cost to ship 6 cards instead of 1? ORDER CANCELLED!"
3,Lots of shipping for a little chip.,Minimum shipping increased the cost by almost 50%. Seems to work in my useless Garmin.
1,Wrong Size,"The peoduct is probubly just fine, I won't know. The item was recommended by Amazon for the media player I purchased. Neither it or the adapter would fit the device."
1,this SD adapter does not work with PE MP4/Mp3 player,"I bought ""Touch Screen 4GB 2.8-Inch TFT MP4/MP3 Movie Music Personal Media Player"" + ""Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter (BULK Packaging) "" which Amazon recommend. but the SD adapter cannot be inserted into slot of Mdia player! I went to lots store for help. but I was told, this SD adapter is too big to inserted! Money just wasted!!Very bad recommendation! amazon just cheat me again to buy more unused goods!!"
3,Great memory for price!!,Hey its great memeory for the price i just wish i had ordered the 8G so i could have more stuff on my phone i dont and wont use...
5,Excellent,Excellent price and works perfectly with my Samsung Omnia. The adapter is an added bonus. I'm never buying this kind of stuff retail again - phone company shops and big electronics retailers will make you pay 2-3 times this price for the same item.
2,Not Impressed,"Before spending your money, make sure it's compatible with your computer. I was told that it's not compatible with most computers, so your best bet is to buy from a retail store, even if it is more expensive. They'll at least let you know if it works before you take it home. A converter only cost $19, but it's the fact that this company doesn't advertise the adapter most likely isn't going to work."
3,SandDisk SD vs SDHC,"Bull_T is coorrect about the SDHC cards.My Motorala I880g Phone will work off the 2GB Sandisk micro, but not the 4 GB SDHC micro. Dude, on the 2GB I have 2 hours of MP3 Music, 50 hours of MP3 podcast, and I still have room for 3 hours of Video and some high resolution Jpegs. Hoo-Ha! Sure wish the 4 gig worked too..."
2,san disc,I was not truly impressed with both of the discs I received as one did not function properly. Since I was in a time sensitive situation I did not return the product. I ordered it from Amazon and received it in a timely manner and was able to complete my task since I ordered two discs and therefore had a backup.
5,Great deal,"I purchased this for my sons camera he received for his b-day, I havent heard anything else out of him about a card. it serve's it's purpose."
1,Adaptors didn't work at all,"I bought these to use in my digital camera, an SD device that supports MicroSDHC with SD Adaptors. And these MicroSDHC cards worked fine -- once I tested them in a friend's adaptor. But the adaptors that came with this didn't work at all, which made the whole product useless to me. I contacted the seller (Digital Media Source) for a refund, and never heard back."
3,Picture is a fake the product isnt a real sandisk product,"This product is a fake, I bought 3 assuming there were real because the picture he has of the 4gb micro sdhc was a real one or what appeared to be. Check the customer image, there should be one picture and then you will see it is a fake. I did not check the image, therefore I did not realize until it was too late. You can tell it is a fake easily by looking at the adapter for the micro sdhc card. Go to the sandisk site and they will have high res pictures of their real products; compare them and you will see a definitive difference. If I knew this I would have rather bought off ebay and could've gotten it for cheaper by atleast $10 for all 3 in total so about $3.33 per card I would have saved. I had bought 3 cards. Don't waste your money on here with this fake, it isn't crappy, but you can get the same for cheaper at ebay. One good thing was the shipping time so if you don't want to wait long then go buy it."
1,dont buy doesnt work,I bought 2 of these memory cards neither one is recognized buy phone or computer with or without adapter just a piece of phony plastic complained to amazon and week later no response DO NOT BUY
5,"Works well with Vista and Samsung Solstice/Flight, but not XP","Was worried about ordering memory cards in bulk due to malware concerns. But these were definitely blank, since I had to format them. They froze my XP machine, but this machine is touchy under good circumstances. My Vista machine formatted them no problem, and they work just fine with our new Samsung Solstice and Flight cell phones."
3,the adapter was missing,i didnt know until now that it was suppose have adapter. :( i love the memory but what happen to my adapter
3,Worked great for 2 years in my cellphone,"Bought this micro SD card back in June 2008 for about $17. Crapped out on me last week (July 2010). Seller sent me link to Sandisk. Sandisk says their 5 year warranty does not apply to Bulk Packaging. Seller says their warranty for this product is only 30 days. Still cannot see where it says the warranty is only 30 days on Amazon. But a new one is under $5, so not a great loss, just expecting a Sandisk product to last longer."
2,Good but not great,"This is a very good Micro SD card for storage like music and videos, but the read rate is terrible for gaming devices, The DS can barely read from it which is what i bought it for, and there doesnt seem to be a way to fix it seeing how its a class 2 SDHC card. Overall get it for storage, but dont get it for gaming."
4,"Good, inexpensive, but slow","This memory card works, it's a good price, but transfer data speed is very low - it's only ""Class 2"" card. Also write protection switcher in my SD adapter for this card doesn't stay in chosen position. So, 4/5."
5,"Used Card for Sansa Clip, Works Fine",I brought this card for my Sansa Clip a year ago and I love it. It has held up for a year and does its job. I have not had a problem with it yet.
5,Card plus card adapter combo,I got this microSDHC card for my Garmin GPS and it works great. The SD card adapter is nice to have even though I don't need it. Getting both for less than $4 is a bargain and I would recommend this to anyone needing a microSD card.
5,OKAY,"WHAT CAN I SAY IT IS AN SD MEMORY ADAPTER, IT WORKS GOOD HAS EXACT AMOUNT OF MEMORY ON THE CARD"
4,Easy and great,Bought this for my video camera and so far no problems with pictures and video great price too. If you have a camcorder then buy this
5,Great product,"I like it now i can listen to my music and use it for my phone, i like sandisk and it is a great product"
4,Good buy,Works real well and serves the purpose. I use on my phone then use the adapter to download pictures I take. Can't beat the price.
4,No problem,"It works nice. standar quality, no problems with recording. good price. The item arrives soon and safe. I really like it."
5,A Bargain for What It Is,works as advertised at a bargain price. no problems here I put mine into an LG100G cellphone.I've never had a problem with SanDisk products.
3,Nice Charm,Size is small. It dainty looking which is okay with me. Had a problem with the company I bought it from. Coundln't get it engraved. Won't buy from this company again.
5,A Brilliant book for Beginners,"You can find things in this book quicker than you can read the title. I had used Linux for a year and bought a set of FreeBSD CDs (just the CDs, no support etc.) I bought this book and I'm really pleased. However, the CD is slightly out of date, FreeBSD was up to release 4.5 but the CD provided was 4.4. (April 2002) Minor problem that will probably always happen. If you have any interest in computers, you'll find yourself dipping in for a read every now and then. You don't have to read it in order, it's good to just read whatever chapter takes your fancy. Everything is explained, but it is never condescending. The index is good, the writing style is excellent. The author has done an excellent job in producing a very useful book for any newcomer to FreeBSD. Buy it."
3,Cute but not durable,This item is super cute but the lipstick fell apart right away so i couldnt let my child play with it as it is a choking hazard when apart.
4,Tippy Toe Murder,"I like all of the ""Lucy Stone"" mysteries. Very down to earth stories.I give them all the same rating. Tippy Toe Murder."
3,Tippy Toe Murder -- why not on Kindle?,"I have the other 19 Lucy Stone Mysteries on my Kindle and am a huge fan. Just the thing for light and entertaining reading. Enjoying watching (?) her kids grow up. So how come this is the only one not yet on Kindle? Am going to hold out until it is, but I've missed a whole chapter in the life of the Stone family."
1,Tippy Toe Murder - Major Downer,"I didn't like this story line at all. It was depressing, and I read for enjoyment. The protagonist wasn't very likeable in this book."
4,Very Bright and Bold,"The book is aptly titled -- WOW is what you'll say as you view the almost outrageously bright and bold drawings on each page. My two year old was a bit overwhelmed, some images were clear, others were harder to distinguish. As native New Yorkers, I appreciated that they illustrated the typical city sights, i.e. SUBWAY, BUILDINGS, TAXIS, BUSES....our children love colorful picture books but in my humble opinion, I think this one, though the wording is short and simple, is best suited for children 3 and up."
1,junk product do not buy,"this is a junk sheath...do yourself a favor and get a leatherman surge..better sheath and it has side elastic pouches for flashlight and batterys..this is junk, i can barley fit my skeletool in it ..there is no easy way to deploy it out..you have to fight with it ...lame...the way this is designed is no good ..there no real depth to it, its big as ever..but you cant fit anything in it..its not deep or wide enough to be called xlarge...its retarded design..i feel like this was made for holding folded paper...i hope thats clear enough for ya ...vertical mount only ...end conclusion...i wish i diddent buy this product...good seller junk product.."
5,For new and old boat owners,"I love Meguiar's products. I used this on a old Ski Nautique boat and was amazed at how easy and well it kept hard water deposits off of the hull. I am using it on a new boat and have trialed it compared to several other boat waxes. Hard water deposits easity came off and water scum was minimal, even if dried on for a few days. It still was beading up water after 2 months of use. The product is easy to apply and a great value. It is also recommended by Correct Craft Mfg."
1,Product comes damaged,"This product came damaged, I couldn't even use the detailing spray. The box was soaking wet and one of the three bottles was completely empty. The boat wash was half full, the other half being all over the box. EXTREMELY BAD PACKAGING!!!"
2,see below,i ordered these as you can see on the box there is three bottles of stuff. when it arrived there were only the was and wax nothing else. still a good price i will keep it
3,Packaging,Upon arrival of the order a bottle was broken and had leaked over the entire order. Poor packaging on someones part.
4,A delectable treat!,"The basket of treats arrived as a gift to friends. From what they shared, and later what I saw, the basket of treats was well put together with a nice selection of various candy."
1,Not what I thought!,"The hairpins that I received did not have rubber tips and broke off my hair everytime I tried to use them! The product I received, contrary to other reviews here, was definitely not ""invisible"". Very heavy pins to be ""invisible"" in my fine hair. I have 497 pins that I would gladly give away!"
4,Big loc always puts it down for Baton Rouge.,"C-loc has been putting it down for a while now. He is probably the most under rated artist from the concentration camp. The other artist on his camp are: MAX MINELLI, J-VON, AND LIL BOOSIE was with the camp. He always puts together pretty good music though."
3,This blush is just ok,"I have been looking for a blush to replace L'Oreal's gel blush, which I absolutely love and they quit making sometime after I bought my last one. It lasts forever. I can't seem to find one. This is the closest I've come, but it doesn't measure up. It's ok, but it doesn't give the nice, natural color of L'Oreal's, and it doesn't apply as smoothly. I'm still looking."
3,It's okay,"I bought this in two colors - the Natural, and this, the Rosy. I really like the Natural, but the Rosy not so much. I mean, it's fine, and I plan to wear it - but the color is less natural (duh) than the Natural. I'm a caramel brown African American woman, and it looks a little clownish on my face unless I control it really well. Unfortunately, it's a rather thin gel and runnier than I expected, so it's difficult to control just how much you put on. It's very easy to apply too much, so you kind of have to dab in layers and blend until you get the right amount. Also, as was mentioned this does NOT last long at all. You'll be doing a touch up two hours after you apply it; it slides right off your face. Still, it's nice for a little flush of color and for a very easy morning application if you don't have the time or desire to fuss over powder blush. I just recommend the Natural instead of this."
2,Pixi Sheer Cheek Gel,"Again, another disappointing gel blush which claims to be a stain--and is not. Messy to apply, and disappears from your cheeks before you even leave the house."
1,rip off,The moot website offers the game for 35bucks - and the cheapest price on amazon is $181.http://www.mootgame.com/howtogetit.html
1,Terrible design on the bag!!!,"Assembly is super easy, installation is easy too.MAJOR issues:the lure is covered with a perforated, fabric-like white material, this allows beetles to crawl all around it without falling in... beetle can easily fly away.if the beetle doesn't land on the lure, it falls down just fine.The bag is TERRIBLE!!!!! the opening between the top portion of the bag and the bottom chamber (where the trapped beetles collect) needs to be re-designed so that there's always an unobstructed hole. put some kind of a plastic ring there.Otherwise, the beetles can not fall through unless I rig this thing to function properly.very poor design overall.Can be made to work with additional materials and labor."
5,It holds up through countless readings.,"My wife and I bought this for our daughter's 4th birthday, and we read it over and over and over to her. And the highest form of praise I can give is I'm not tired of it.James Marshall was a great writer. The stories are short, 3 or 4 pages at most (you get 5 stories per book, all 35 in here). Marshall used an economy of words to tell the stories, but he chose his words well. How many other picture books would you find the sentence ""Martha strongly objected""?As for the illustrations, Marshall made it totally believable that hippos can go to the movies, walk tightropes, and high dive.Someone complained in a review that some of the stories end abruptly, but life is like that sometimes. I don't think kids will mind (grownups maybe, but not kids)."
5,George & Martha: Problem Solvers,"My fiance and I had been struggling to come up with vows for our upcoming wedding for some time. Then, one day, it hit me. As a children's librarian, I had so many resources at my fingertips, it was a wonder that I hadn't thought about it before. I brought home a stack of George and Marthas from work and we have each picked a story to read to each other at our wedding. Thank you James Marshall, wherever you are, for giving us something that so perfectly illustrates what we are trying to convey!"
1,Watch the TV show; skip this book,"We are huge fans of the George and Martha TV show, so I bought this book for our three and five year old children. It was so disappointing. The basic stories are the same as the ones featured on TV, but they are only 3 or 4 pages (really just a few sentences) long. We were reading it, wondering if we were missing something. The stories just seem to end mid-thought. Now, we just laugh about it. When I read one of the stories to my daughter, after the first sentence, she says ""the end"" and we all laugh. The TV program on HBO family is so much better, with character development, cool music, and a hilarious ensemble of animal friends."
5,Adults can appreciate this one as well...,"I just recently came across the George and Martha stories, and I couldn't be happier that they're now released in a complete collection! Every child should be exposed to the witty, funny writing of James Marshall...he's a genius! His talent for capturing each character from simple drawings is uncanny, and the short stories make it easy for children to hear MORE! I haven't read these stories to a child yet who didn't love them. Don't let your children miss out on George and Martha - CLASSIC!"
5,This book is really good and funny.,As a family we have read this book numerous times and love it. They are best friends. They are really funny when they are frightened.My sister aged 4 loves the stories and they are simple enough for me to read to her. Every child should read this book.
5,Life coaching,The perfect wedding gift - will help all couples figure out how each others work & think.
1,Price reflects quality,"When I connected the product, the quality of the output on the monitor was so degraded, I had to disconnect. The quality of the cable must be so poor that it renders it ineffective to be used for its intended purpose. The low price reflects low quality."
2,Splits signals but with problems,The product does what it says but the resulting signal is weak and lines are going up both displays.
1,Auditory crime against children,"Within minutes of listening to this I considered putting it back up for sale on Amazon, then realized that would make me an accessory. This is just plain bad. It's not sung by kids, it's sung by adults trying to sound like kids, the result of which can best be called The Stepford Choir. The instrumentation is a joke - I've never heard fun holiday songs sound so limp. Save your money, and more importantly your child's ears, from this awful awful disk."
2,?,Maybe I'm just not an opera fan? I hated the singing! I really wanted to hear her story from the author. I found it very frustrating to watch.
2,once over very lightly,"I had high hopes for this software, but I found the games to be less than fun. All in all I would not buy this software had I seen it first. However there is vocabulary and possibly for an older child it would be helpful. I doubt my first grader will ""play"" with it."
2,Highly overrated,"The Ransack I opened had lost one of his foot pegs in manyfacturing, but even with it, I don't see how it could possibly stand well. The vehicle mode is cool enough, and robot isn't bad, but the figure still comes across as overpriced; it's not much bigger than 2 mini-cons. I'd avoid this one unless you are really into Tron's light cycles."
1,Lasted less than one day!,I have a drain next to my driveway and after living in the house for 7 years the old grate was breaking up from cars driving on it occasionally. I put the new one in place and threw out the old one. The next day the new one was broken worse than the old one! So I fished the old one out of the trash and put it back in place and threw away the new one. Save your money and avoid this clunker!
3,I found the conditioner to work decently but ...,"I found the conditioner to work decently but not well. It didn't leave my hair soft and silky but did leave it fairly tangle free. Overall, for those with damaged hair, I'd recommend it if the cost were decent."
2,The smell was much better than with most ...,"The smell was much better than with most dandruff shampoos. I have very long hair and it really tangles after I wash it. This product didn't help much with that, but then again, it's not supposed to. I think I defeated the purpose by having to use my normal conditioner on top of it so I could brush my hair out. I think someone with shorter hair would love this product, but I had some problems with it."
4,Nicely Compact Dictionary Phrasebook,"Was pretty good for my one week in Egypt. Gave me what I needed, but has plenty more there if I want to take my Arabic studies further."
4,"For the most part, it's good","There are a few minor things I'm not fond of in this book, but for the most part, it is good.I like the fact that the author uses Arabic as well as English in the phrasebook.And he teaches some basic expressions as well as what I call ""tourist Arabic"" (where's the nearest restaurant?)I would recommend this book, it is good, and it's useful. But I'd still be more inclined to recommend the Lonely PlantEgyptian Arabic phrasebook."
4,not bad,"This is a decent dictionary for a language that changes constantly. I still refer to it often. It is a good supplement for a class, if you can find one, on Egyptian."
3,Decent Phrasebook.,"This book advertises itself as an Egyptian phrasebook, and that's exactly what it is. There are a couple of brief sections that discuss the language and a give some common phrases, some accompanied by Arabic script which is nice, but mostly it's a small Arabic-English, English-Arabic dictionary. It seems like it would be a useful reference tool, but certainly not the sort of book that would help you learn the language. Egyptian Arabic is one of the tougher dialects, in my opinion, because it's a bit further from standard Arabic than some of the versions spoken in other parts of the Middle East, so a book like this is definitely useful. I've seen a couple other phrasebooks like this one, but this one seems to be one of the better ones. If you are looking for a compact and affordable reference book to carry around, this one is worth checking out."
2,Not very useful,"Doesn't have much info - it's a Rough Guide diluted 5:1.Huge empty page margins, big spacing between lines...Adds nothing to my Rough Guide..."
5,Great CD!,I used to own this cd on record. I never thought I would find this on cd without paying over $30. Great price for great music.
3,"A great artist but not a great cd, recomended only for fans","I'm a big Joo Gilberto fan and I have all cds he recorded. The problem with this cd is the quality of the recording. It isn't very good and on some songs the orquestra on the background makes it almost impossible to listen to Gilberto's voice and his guitar. There are some enjoyable songs when there is no orquestra, only Gilberto and his guitar. Only for this part it worth to buy this cd. If you are starting you should get this only after you get the others."
4,Be A Discerning Listener...,"As a fan of Joao Gilberto, I listened to this album with high expectations. Honestly, I was a little let down, but mostly due to my own over-hyping of the experience.Don't misunderstand though, there are some gems on this album. Do not overlook the rendition of Chega De Saudade which features a very young Bebel Gilberto. This track alone, being so sweet and simple, makes the purchase worth your money... because, after all, the album is not a bad contribution from the legendary Gilberto."
1,Not Donnie Iris's Best Work,"This album was a big disappointment to me. Being a fan, the only really good song on this one is Poletown."
1,AWFUL,"I've got it all, from Mr. Ierace (Iris) - Jaggerz, Wild Cherry, Cruisers, Cellar Full of Noise, etc. Ever heard ""hold On to Your Hiney"" or ""Here come the 80'S""; Well I've got it all. This is the WORST album he ever put his name on. As the Seattle Grunge sound was finally being buried (thank God), Donnie releases this attempt (his version) of the Seattle grunge. - AWFUL !!!"
5,saved my 3yr. old daughter's hair,My 3 yr. old daughter had HORRIBLE tangles! I read reviews and tried the Infusium shampoo and leave in conditioner. What a miracle- we comb through her hair easily every night and without tears! THANK YOU INFUSIUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Coasters!!,"Three words - ""Piece Of Junk"", ""Don't Buy It"" unless you'd rather have ""Four New Coasters"". Not at all user friendly - even to the computer literate. Content is not at all captivating to the young ones, hard to navigate and there is NO HELP! After I tried to play it for my kid, I thought at least one of the four CD's may have something worthwhile - no such luck! The only reason I gave it one star is because that is the lowest I can go!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I was extremely dissappointed by this software. My 2 year old son loves the computer and he loves to play games, however he just did not ""get"" these games. The box says it's supposed to be educational, but I just don't see how. I would not recommend this software to anyone with a toddler."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this as the first software for my 2 year old. I can't even figure out how to use it. As the others have said, don't waste your money. There are no instructions with the materials."
1,Don't buy it!,"I thought that this package was basically a waste of money. My son has a minor speech problem, so we were able to use one of the disks for having him practice his speech. Other than that....it stunk."
2,Disappointingly bad software,"Out of the four CD you receive, we are only pleased with the first CD. The others are either hard to figure out what you are supposed to do or it just brings you to other websites. not worth any money to purchase this CD. My daughter loves playing games on the computer and she never wants to play this one."
5,Great,I bought this book for my 4 year old son and he loves it. The book was still in excellent condition. Thank you!
1,Wishin it would fit,"Looked wonderful, received quickly. Ordered twice for a compact truck, received twice a full size truck net. Gave up and build my own."
1,cheap bait and switch,"This faucet hole cover is not as advertised or depicted in the website photo: Threading is NOT heavy duty brass construction. Coverplate is NOT thick gauge, brushed stainless steel as shown on website but a cheap, tinny, lightweight substitute made in Taiwan which feels like cheap tin. This is NOT a 1 3/4"" diameter top, but 2"". The difference between what was advertised and what arrived is day and night. I could've bought this cheap imitation for $3.99, not the $20 I paid for a top quality faucet hole cover. This faucet hole cover was definitely not manufactured by the reputable Jones Stephens Corp as unfortunately advertised."
5,Quite Nice,This is very beautiful and I like the material and I know that it will make a nice impact with my outfit
5,Gummed paper tape,"This is one big role and I love it, I was able to tape to wood another canvas without it moving or budging. And very easy to remove. Fast shipping"
3,got the job done,"it was about what i though it would be but the ""t"" part of the handle is not as long as it looks in the pic. so i had to use a short pipe to get more pulling power to turn the valve.it being 5 feet long and the hole the valve's in is about a ft. deep made it just right."
5,I love the Neutrogena Conditioner. I have very ...,I love the Neutrogena Conditioner. I have very fine hair and this gives it a lot of body and shine without leaving an oily feeling. My hair feels really clean and smells great! I'll definitely buy this product.
4,"I have really long hair, and have always ...","I have really long hair, and have always had a problem finding a conditioner that will get the tangles out but not feel heavy, even after it's rinsed out. This conditioner does work without feeling heavy. I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't need a conditioner with a lot of moisturizer. It works great on my hair!"
4,"My daughter has very curly, very unmanageable hair. ...","My daughter has very curly, very unmanageable hair. This conditioner really helped both of us. It really helped take the knots out of her hair and made brushing so much easier. I recommend this product."
3,Save your money,"The Lansky ""Super"" Sapphire Polishing Hone is not worth the extra cost. Use the ultra-fine included with the kit and you'll be very happy unless you are a knife snob and have to have the jewelry."
5,EXCELLENT,"MADE AN EXTREMELY RAZOR SHARP EDGE ON MY HUNTING KNIFE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND AS THE ""FINISHING TOUCH"" AFTER USING THE FINE STONE."
5,Excellent finishing stone - has more bite than the Ultra-Fine.,"Lansky bills the Super Sapphire as the ultimate finishing stone for the Lansky system and I'm not going to disagree. I find that the super sapphire has a bit of a granular feel, with more bite than the pink fine or white ultra fine stones. It feels like it removes more metal than either of those, I get a robust burr pretty quickly - but the edge produced is blamelessly sharp. I've had it for a month now and always use it after the pink fine stone and marvel at how well and quickly it raises a burr compared to the pink or white stones. I find that a bit mystifying given that the grit is finer. Maybe the super sapphire is finer grit but softer? In any case it's an awesome finishing stone. My knives have a razor-like finish."
3,Rarely Use,This is a great product. But your money is better spent buying a coarser grade of sharpening stone. The extra fine shines my blades already.
2,Not a polishing stone in the least,This sharpener is nice but its not for polishing an edge after its been sharpened. To me this stone is somewhere between a lanskys medium and fine stone. The ultra fine yellow is much better for putting on a keener edge!
2,structural problems,"the hone works well, until it hits the heel of the blade, and massive chips fall off, which leaves little dinks that scratch your blade. my advice is to live with a 1000 grit stone (the yellow lansky one doesn't have this problem) or to learn how to use a benchstone."
4,Does the job.,"I’ve been looking for a hobby to while away the hours (not really), and the Sapphire Polishing Stone might just get the job done. If you already have your edge sharpened and shaped, and the with enough time, patience, and honing oil, this hone will give you a chrome like finish.Not recommenced for the casual knife sharpener, its better suited for a “Knife Snob” who feels a knife is a functional work of art.I didn’t know I was a “Knife Snob”, but after an hour or two polishing the edge on my Ka Bar Fighting Knife, I fear I have another hobby."
3,Overkill for most knives,"I got this to complete my Lanksy set of sharpeners. However, much to my surprise I found this stone to be overkill for most edges. This stone merely polishes out the super fine stones honing. If anything it'll reduce drag when cutting due to the polished edge."
3,adequate,This item was OK. It did polish the knife to a luster. Since the whole system wobbled it became very frustrating.
4,Great knife for the price.,This knife is awesome. A little hard to break in at first but after about a week I was able to open it easily with one hand. The only problem with this knife is that the pocket clip is sharp and gets in the way. In one week I gashed my thumb getting out of the car and put a six inch scratch on the side of my car getting in. This is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.
3,Too small,I guess it is my fault for not reading the specifications more closely. It is nicely built but too small for my preference.
1,Buyer Beware - Very Poor Quality Software,"The software included in this set is of very poor quality. They will change your screen colors since they need to be run in 256 color mode. The games themselves are flawed with bugs. The answers to some of the questions were incorrect. I have an advanced degree in medicine, but even that did not help to address these shortcomings. I have also purchased the middle and High school math and Middle school math excelerator software and all of them are from the same company - TOPICS ENTERTAINMENT. I would recommend not to purchase ANY of the Excelerator titles, for not only are they a waste of your time and money, but they include two programs that are the same in both the Middle School and Middle School Math, which are the Pre-Algebra and Algebra programs. You would be better off buying another title from a different company....Buyer Beware!!!"
2,Good for elevator music,"I had high hopes for this CD. Maybe that was the problem. I had imagined this would be something along the lines of the cover tunes the Bartron Tyler Group does in their Beatles renditions. Granted BTG is a group, Stephen Bennett is one person, so there's a difference. The biggest difference is BTG makes the songs their own. Stephen Bennett plays the songs almost unfailingly note for note in the exact tempo they were done by the Beatles. I might as well listen to the Beatles doing them. There's no venturing out here, no stylizing. For me, this was a big disappointment."
1,No Support,"We have had this camera for less than 2 years when the ac adapter quit working. Unfortunately, Toshiba quit making parts to this and there is no place to get replacement parts. This is really sorry that this nice camera is basically useless when something goes wrong with it!"
2,Low Light and AF are Major Problems,"The camera size is great, and it is easy to use. Battery life is fine and HD storage space is ample.The problem is that this camera does not function well at all in low light, and the autofocus is shaky unless you are filming outdoors in good light. Even in these ideal conditions, the cameras is sluggish to focus when shifting from close up to further away and zooming.Capturing important indoor activities (Christmas, Easter, school plays, kindergarten graduation) is not easily accomplished do to the low light performance and the issues with sluggish AF.I would not recommend this camera to others."
3,not bad.,"great amount of storage, lacks audio input, and the auto focus is noisy on it, and isn't fast enough when zooming in. not bad for the amount of recording you can do. the cam is really small as well."
1,Outside Use Only,"I loved this camera for outside use, but anything inside with even marginally low light and the video quality is so poor it is unwatchable. If you shoot indoors at all, this is not the camera for you."
1,This is a scene for scene remake of a 1976 superior film.,Watch the Peter Falk/Jill Clayburgh one as this 2007 remake is a complete waste of film besides being a scene for scene remake except that they changed & made a lame worthless ending to this one compared to the original. Should have remastered the 1976 one & never remade it with this piece of junk. I suppose if the producers remade Duel they would change the ending to where Dennis Weaver buys the truck driver lunch before he runs off the cliff.
4,Heartbreakingly heartwarming,"I stumbled across this movie on accident when I was researching something else online and I told a friend about it. She added it to her Netflix list and reported back that she really liked it a lot so I ordered it on Amazon. (I'm a huge fan of both Dermot Mulroney and Amanda Peet, I would have wanted to own it just having both of them in it.)I finally sat down and watched it tonight and loved it.It's quirky and heavy and charming and heartwarming.I've read reviews in which both Mulroney and Peet received very good marks for their performances and I completely agree. This subject matter is hard to handle but it was done well - showing both the delicacy of the situation and the full on anger that comes with it.I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone looking for a tug on the heartstrings or a touch of raw human emotion."
2,Strange movie...,"The man finds out he is dying and he starts a relationship with someone? Doesn't anyone think that is strange? The movie starts emotional and never stops. Definitely get the kleenex. You will need at least a whole box by the time this movie is over! I didn't like the movie but if you need to cry, rent this movie!"
2,A Sad Second,"The original movie is no longer available, so I ordered this. A sad second. Hopefully someday the original movie will be available again. No comparison."
5,Excellent version,Peet & Mulroney give superb performances in this version. Definately an emotional as well as humorous ride. A well cast and produced film.
3,Really morose fatal illness flick,"First off, this couple looks way too healthy all through this movie to be both on the brink of death from fatal cancers. Even when the woman enters the hospital for the last time, her hair shines perfectly. No bags under her eyes, or skeletal frame here. I know, I know, the message here is really important, things about living to the max and never too late for love etc etc. But the combination of the mopey soundtrack and the depressing subject really set me back a few steps. Not since Ryan O'Neill and Ali McGraw in ""Love Story"" has a fatal illness movie crossed my viewing path. If you can stand the emotional impact, then watch this. But if you cry easily, or prefer to avoid sentimental romance films about death, avoid avoid."
4,Nice subset of Messiah,"This is a nice subset of Messiah. I also have an entire Messiah, so this is supplemental for me. What I like is the soprano on here is very good in my opinon, actually has two sopranos. I found the bass to not have as deep of a sound as on two other recordings of Messiah that I have, almost like he is more towards baritone, but it does list bass. The liner notes are fairly extensive and include quotes from letters written at the time this music was being composed and first being performed, which makes for some pretty interesting reading."
3,While I feel this product would be good ...,"While I feel this product would be good for fine or medium hair, my hair is coarse and curly. Even though I followed the directions, it seemed to weigh my hair down and give it an unnatural look. I wear my hair naturally curly (don't blow dry, just dry naturally) and this product doesn't allow my hair to look natural. It smells great and I'm sure it'd be a good product for a different type of hair."
5,"I've been using a salon product that's expensive, ...","I've been using a salon product that's expensive, but after using the Clairol mousse, I'll definitely change. It was very creamy and held my hair in place and dried like I styled it. This is well worth the price -- I'm going to save me some money."
5,Great!,"I already love this mousse. Unfortunately, there are not too many stores that carry it. The ones that do carry the product, charge more than I can buy it in bulk here. It is a bit expensive on this site due to shipping, but still better than the stores. :\"
1,Beware refurbished Maxxum 3's,"I bought a factory refurbished Maxxum 3 and immediately regretted it. Both rolls of film I tried, it spontaneously rewound the film after taking 4-5 pictures! Nice."
3,Severely limiting,"I've owned one for a good 6 years now (give or take) and it's a decent camera for the point and shoot minded photographer. While being an SLR, it's still a fully automatic camera. This means no light meter, no adjusting of aperture or shutter speed and little control in the way of adjusting for situations. It's the type of camera that a user will quickly grow out of. I personally found myself using it as a tourism camera, with a Cannon AE-1 for serious projects (until a more modern Rebel replaced them both).It's a funny camera really. It has the capability to look serious until you notice it has only 5 buttons (one being a redundant autofocus button), and the camera is also very light and compact. I've noticed if the film is not put in juuust right, it can sometimes auto-rewind after a shot or two. It's no fun having to dig out negatives and/or throw away a couple shots sometimes.I was honestly just a kid when I bought the camera, but I wish I took my money to something else now."
3,"Adequate summary for informal assessment only, inadequate treatment section.","I'll just briefly diverge somewhat from Mr. Lassiter above to say that while the ""bulk"" of this slim book provides a solid introduction to the issues for informal assessment (falling short of sufficient depth for formal assessment), the very brief section on treatment is completely inadequate if you are a clinician looking for concrete help planning intervention, and is not a particularly good resource for further exploration. There is much more information available on treatment than is even hinted at in this book, even after a brief time with Google: to place treatment in the title of this book is misleading. For context, I'm the clinical supervisor for a family therapy program, and a Licensed Professional Counselor.That this book was published as part of the Practitioner's Resource Series promises more than it delivers. This was my first foray into Amazon's offerings on the topic, and I'll keep looking."
3,Pyle PDBT35 1-Inch experience,"I ordered and installed 1 unit in the center of my double 15 inch mid-high speakers to generate more highs at standing ear level when these speakers are stacked on the subwoofers. I was amazed at the improvement in sound quality and the volume seemed to leap out with gusto! On the second night of use, both tweeters blew out at less than 500 watts output. Actually, less than 400 watts. I believe the handling capacity is overrated, but using the included capacitors and a compressor is helping to maintain the life, so I ordered two more for my other cabinets. Let's see how long they hold up."
4,review,I think that fthis tweeter performs extreamly wll for the price.I was very please at the quality of sound it produced.
5,Die-hard Fan!,"I've also been using Infusium 23 for 30+ years. I don't think I could live without it as I have fine curly hair that is painful to try and comb and would turn into dreadlocks given half a chance. I've also started using it on my daughter's fine, straight hair as a de-tangler with great success. As far as I'm concerned, this is an essential hair care product after shampoo and conditioner."
1,Leaves a sticky residue,"My daughter always had a head of matted hair. It was frustrating to detangle and I was advised by more than one person to try Infusium. Well, I did and I was more than disappointed. The children's detanglers work much better. Not only did Infusium not help detangle my daughter's hair, it left a sticky residue for me to wash off. I still have nearly an entire bottle left that will go unused."
