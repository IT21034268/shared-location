3,Fifty Famous Poeple,Easy reading; not complicated but designed for 5th to 7th grade students. Some passages didn't flow well however. I would not buy again. Good for upper elementry or middle schools.
2,fifty famous people,not a book I would rate highly. A quick read and then forget it. Look elsewhere for a stimulating reading experience.
5,Biography of Pancake a welcome literary event,"This is a satisfying book for anyone interested to learn more about the life of Breece Pancake. A thoughtful biographical account of Pancake's life provides a detail and depth of information about his past, roots and conflicts heretofore unmatched. Also, a thoughtful critique of his work is followed by a most satisfying compilation of his letters, which, for one deeply curious about this author about whom little of substance has been written, is like striking gold. This is a gem of a book for Breece Pancake admirers."
5,"sleighbells clang, are ya listenin?",great cd. this is the one i play to get in the christmas mood when i am feeling scroogish. my vinyl copy was kaput. reminisent of the old spike jones stuff.
1,wrong product,I ordered this and got a cream instead. Then they tried to keep my money after I returned it. I did get my money back but it was very annoying
3,"Great Snack, but Cheaper at Walmart or Samsclub","Of course I love nature valley bars! I was excited to get a subscription for this item to get delivered every six months and get it for cheaper. However, I made a recent trip to walmart and the price of one box was $4.00. So it would have been cheaper just to buy six boxes at walmart than order off of amazon! I recommend you cross check the prices at your local stores and make sure you're actually saving your money by subscribing."
5,Math 101,"This is a case of 6 boxes, and each box contains 12 two-packs. It came out to nearly HALF the cost compared to my local grocery. How can you go wrong? It's a bargain for this family."
3,crunchy but to friable,I can hardly eat this bar without it disintegrating into dust. The pieces that break off are good though.
1,do not buy from amazon. buy from local store,I checked the local store. The price is the same as amazon. and you donot need to buy a huge bulk.
4,Mesh Bedrail,"I like the fact that it is double sided and that the two rails connect under the mattress. However, I think it could be improved in the area of putting the sides down. It is just a little inconvenient. You have to be able to pull up the ""dowles"" at the same time, one on each side."
1,Two sets broken in two months!,"We purchased this set twice for our 2 year old son. The framework is metal, but the hinges are plastic. (whose bright idea was that?) Our son managed to break them just by leaning on them and he isn't a big kid. Since the hinge is plastic, the hinge just snapped in two. We've since bought another brand (One Step Ahead) and that one broke (in the same way) within a week of delivery. We are still looking for the best rail, short of my husband building a wooden ""cage"" to go around the bed. I don't recommend purchasing this product unless you like to make frequent trips to BRU to return the rails and having to take apart the bed every time they break"
1,JUNK!!!,"We are on our second set and the company had to send a new one. My son leaned against it and fell out of bed when he was 2 so we got a new set through the company and it broke with in a month and we have been bolting it together since then, all 4 edges are broke. They break so easy and we cannot keep replacing them like they are disposable especially at that price. I have been looking for something better and won't let my son fall out of bed when it breaks."
3,sides should not be used by themselves,"I bought this particular product because I liked the fact that there were two, and it fit a Queen-sized bed (we actually have a full, but this was better than the shorter ones). I needed two side rails, one for the right side of the bed and one for the bottom, as the bed we are using does not have a footboard and the other two sides are blocked by walls. I didn't realize that in order for these sides to be stable, they must be used on opposite sides of the bed and attached to each other using the straps on the legs. We used these the first night unattached to each other, and our daughter ended up pushing the side out until she was able to roll out between the rail and the side of the bed, then eventually on the floor. We will be returning these. If we needed one for each side of the bed then these may be fine, so I don't want to give it a completely negative review, just didn't work for what we needed."
3,The Manitou,"I got to know about Graham Masterton through his 3rd Manitou series,""The Burial"",and like most of his fans,always wonder why he is not more well-known.In my opinion,he is indeed the grandmaster of horror , always able to shock you at every turn , and making you laugh at the other . Extremely graphic in his descriptions of gore and bloodsheds and exhibit humour in the face of adversity.The Manitou marks the beginning of the series,and introduced Harry Erskine to the world.It may not be as gripping as ""The Burial"",and shorter too,but it gave you the worthy introduction it should,and you will never rest until you collect and finish the whole series.Personally,I think he is so much better than Stephen King."
2,Poorly written,"One of the worst books I have read this year. I trudged through it though it had some good parts. The premise of a medicine man growing out of a tumor on the back of a young girl was ok but the writing was not. Masterton seems to think that everyone is a believing soul and that a major hospital would just let any old charlatan march in and assist on a case. The plot and characters are weak, the scene and characters are extremely dated and the moral fabric to me is insulting."
5,goodbye cords,"Bought this as a gift for my other half over a year ago. He loves it, and it still works great.This model has a ""chirp"" to it. When the battery is charged, the dock chirps really softly. It sounds like a cricket. But don't worry, it's not too loud that it will annoy you. It's meant to remind you to remove the battery from the dock as soon as it's done charging. This will extend the life of your batteries. It's a nice feature. Love this product."
5,Great product!,"Works fantastic! It takes a little time to get a good toast, but the outcome is great. For that price, I am happy!"
5,Amazon free freight is a lie,I bought this item and was supposed to get free freight.I was charged 17.97 freigtht
3,Deadly Dames Collection,"All three of these VCi movies have been available for some time. I own Slightly Scarlet, and while it is in Enchanced Widescreen it looks like a VHS copy. I would like to know if these three movies have been remastered for this new release? Otherwise I'll just perchase Blond Ice for $9.99, and keep my current copy of Slightly Scarlet."
1,Disappointment,Not well written and poorly plotted. I expected this to be more like the Lee Child books but it does not even come close.
4,Another great offering from Goldman,"William Goldman amazes me more with each work of his I explore. Dan Brown could really take a lesson from him. I won't spoil anything, but there are two different storylines that alternate chapter until the characters meet at the turning point. I am not a fan of ""The DaVinci Code"" for exactly that story telling devise; however, where Dan Brown made it seem cliche and frustrating, Goldman uses it to weave two seemingly unrelated stories together to form a taint thriller with an excellent climax. A quick, entertaining read."
4,Tightly Written Account of an Unlikely Protagonist,"Marathon Man is tightly woven tale of espionage which involves a protagonist who is drawn into the action completely against his will, and in an extraordinarily short period of time. This is a tough book to review without giving away how the seemingly disparate characters interrelate, but suffice it to say the way in which they do is both clever and clearly well designed. Though there is clearly a rich history to the main character (and his family) which is alluded to often, it never truly gets developed, and the actual action sequences take place over a 36 hour or so span.Nevertheless, the pace, dialog, and conflict are all realistic, and artfully enough crafted so as not to seem rushed, and there are some interesting spices added to the mix which seem incongruous, including marathon running, dentistry, and Nazism. Lastly, there is a chilling torture scene and enough revenge exacted to reward you for rooting for the good guys."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Not a fan. For a thriller, I would say this is too overblown, and it is not quite far enough to the other type of writing to get a good horror book, either. The bad guy being a killer dentist is close to that end of the spectrum, it would seem. Then there is a bit much of the whole running, running, running, theme throughout."
5,Vintage suspense novel,"William Goldman's ""Marathon Man"" is my favorite novel of all time. I have probably reread it 20 times. It can act as a virtual textbook on the creation of suspense and terror. Goldman has a firm grasp of what frightens people. He juxtaposes different points of view very effectively and creates characters which you cannot help but care about. It contains what is probably the most famous (and infamous) torture sequence ever commited to paper. The novel is violent but doesn't glorify violence which is a very delicate line to walk on. Goldman is wordsmith without peer. His prose sparkles and is memorable. He lately has been concentrating on screenplays and has not written a novel since 1986 (which coincidentally was a sequel to this novel called ""Brothers"".) I can only hope that he finds the time to produce a few more novels. Thirteen years has been too long to wait for another Goldman novel. Read all of his novels, you won't be disappointed."
3,good story... poor research,"As usual Maeve Binchey wrote a rather interesting story - however, she has a lot of mistakes in it. Two of the charactures, (a German and an American) say things they would NEVER say in real life. At one point they are learning the ""German"" toast... SKOL! (This toast is NORWIEGEN!) Also SEVERAL times she has the American speaking in totaly BRITISH speech patterns which are completely wrong for him and which he would never use. She also beats to death the idea of the ""quiet sea taking so many lives"". You get really tired of hearing it. Over all it is a good story but Ms. Binchey REALLY needs to bone up on her research next time!"
2,Will the real Mauve please come back????,"I love Mauve Binchy & have read all of her books, however this book is a big disappointment. Normally her books will grab you from page one & will not let you go. This book was somewhat a chore to get through. The characters are boring, so you are left not caring. I look forward to her next book & the real Mauve to come shining through."
2,I think all the rain got to Binchy's head...,"Not that this story isn't enjoyable, but it is a little plastic compared to her other books. I missed the lengthy, entertwining lives of the characters I have come to love in her other novels. But the outcome of these characters are rather predictable...let's hope for another ""Circle of Friends"" next time."
2,My mom would like it,"Not sure why this book has 2 different posts for reviews.This is one of my mom's favorite authors. I am 44 & we don't really have the same taste in books. I keep trying to give this author a chance because my mom loves her so much. Don't get me wrong I would love to see the landscape that she describes so beautifully in this book. I'm sure this Greek seaside village is beautiful. The characters in the book I couldn't connect with. I was totally bored & waiting for Adonis to show up - yes, that is really his name.I can't stand to not finish a book & frankly I am glad this one is over so I can start another one."
4,It entertained me.,"Although this may not be Maeve Binchey's best, it hooked me and made me want to come back to it all the way through. The characters were well drawn and believable. The circumstances of their meeting and their bonding required the reader to suspend disbelief. That never prevented my enjoying them and the wonderful Greek setting. I recommend it!"
2,Lukewarm,The novel Nights of Rain and Stars is written at a very basic reading level and the plot was fairly predictable. The characters were one dimensional and not especially likable.
2,Below Binchy's Best,"I eagerly looked forward to this book - I'm a true Binchy fan - and I was disappointed. While the setting is intriguing and her warmth is there, the characters are boring and one-dimensional, and the story is so plodding and predictable it is unbelievable - I kept reading it, expecting one of the famous Binchy twists, but it never came. I kept wondering where her startling insights into characters had gone - these were stock characters, with none of the unique and human foibles that make most of her characters so memorable and alive.If you are not a Binchy fan, please don't judge her books by this one - read London Transports, Next Year It Will Be Different, Circle of Friends, Dublin Tales, etc. Those are all wonderful, and show why she is so beloved by readers."
1,This CAN'T be the real Maeve Binchy,"I have read many of Maeve Binchy's novels. Many! This book couldn't have been written by her. Her novels all leave me with some kind of message about living and life. This novel was filled with shallow, empty, undeveloped characters. Plot? Message? No. Don't buy it!"
4,The Binchy I like Best,"I've read maybe 7 Binchy novels. This is the only one that I have kept and even reread. It's shorter than the others and you don't get so many details of the people's lives as in her other books, which to me is a good thing. Her writing is better, sparer. It's as if she took a nice refreshing vacation herself and the results showed up in this book."
4,Liked this book,"I have only read a couple of Maeve Binchy's books and while I am sure this is not the best, I did think this was a good book. I loved the Greek setting and I thought it was a good, entertaining summer read. I would recommend it for a beach read."
2,Where di my author go?,"Maeve Binchy has always been in my top five authors. I loved her previous works enough to start collecting them. When i bought this book I settled down with a cup of tea and prepared myself for an enjoyable afternoon. Boy was I wrong. This book was nothing like the previous novels I had come to expect. From the very beginning it was confusing, boring and overwhelmed me with too many characters with no real value. I kept hoping that it would start to make sense and the storyline would emerge, but it just never happened. I finished this book on the stupid rule I have about never leaving a book half read and gritted my teeth through the pain. the book had a beautiful cover and an interesting blurb on the back, but just as I have seen with theater previews...that may have been the best part!"
4,I liked it . . . I really liked it.,"I liked this book enough to read it in one sitting. I'm not sure what other readers found, but having spent a lot of time in Greece and in the Greek Isles, I was enchanted by the story of four strangers, all running from someting, who land on the magical Aghia Anna, forge friendships and confront their demons.Binchy is a master at creating colorful supporting characters, so it's no surprise that this book's color goes to the wild Vonni (reminiscent of the teacher in EVENING CLASS).I enjoyed every moment of the book and would recommend it to anyone who loves great stories, well-told.Enjoy!"
2,flimsy,"A friend loaned me three Binchy novels. I read ""Nights of Rain and Stars"" first. I just finished ""Evening Class"" and I see why reviewers who have been her fans were so disappointed with ""Nights of Rain and Stars."" Big contrast! ""Evening Class"" was a fun read. ""Nights of Rain and Stars"" was like an outline of a novel - sketchy, undeveloped, barely interesting.And I felt that the four vacationers, if they really had any respect for the community that suffered this tragedy (which compels them all to linger), would discreetly move on rather than gawking at the aftermath and projecting their own emotionalism onto the real pain of strangers."
2,I am disappointed,"I enjoy Maeve Binchy's books, especially Scarlet Feather. This was not up to her standards. While I did like the change of scenery (this novel is set in idyliic Greece) I felt that the characters were not fleshed out. I could not belive some of the romances (especially towards the end of the novcel) or the one-dimensional character of Shane, who is cast as a moronic villain.I think what was the most disappointing aspect was that certain characters (especially David) were left w/o any closure at all.This novel didn't ring true and wasn't especially well-written either."
3,Missing that classic Binchey twist,"Nights of Rain and Stars was an ok read. I am a huge Binchey fan and found this book missing the twist that is in most of her really good books. The end of her best books tend to have something, like the hotel burning in ""Firefly Summer"", the injury and miscarriage in ""Circle of Friends"", the tragic car accident in ""Glass Lake"". That twist that an Irish friend described as ""typically Gaellic"" is missing from this book and from some of her not quite best efforts, like ""Quentins"".I had a hard time really caring about these characters and never got as invested in them as I did in her best novels."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"We just read this book for our book club and no-one liked it. It never took off. I probably read chapter 1 about 5 times hoping I missed something. It seemed like the writer was under the gun to produce a book and that it was thrown together. You just didn't care about these people. We all agreed it had a pretty cover but no substance. We spent our discussion thinking of better ways this story could have gone. The ending was wrapped up neatly and ""everyone lives happily every after"". It just was not realistic."
2,Disappointing...,"I've read a lot of Maeve Binchy's novels in the past (Scarlet Feather, Circle of Friends, Light a Penny Candle, Echoes, Firefly Summer, The Glass Lake, Evening Class, Tara Road). Her books are typically the kind of book that you fall into and can't put down. I keep reading one last chapter before bed, until I realize that it is 2 a.m. So I picked up a copy of Nights of Rain And Stars. What a disappointment! The characters are flat, I had little interest in what happened to them, the outcomes were wrapped up too easily for some characters, and the writing was not very good. I had to force myself to keep picking it up and finish it, which took several weeks, because it simply was not that enjoyable or interesting. If you are looking to read some Maeve Binchy, don't start here. Try Evening Class or Tara Road."
1,Ugh,"I received this book after failing to respond to my book club in time, but I thought I'd give it a shot. It was a waste of time.It started off well enough, and I initially liked Ms. Binchy's writing style, so I kept going. There were several flaws, however:1. The characters (save Vonni) seemed to be cardboard cutouts. If they were any more one-dimensional, they'd be a dot.2. The end result was too predictable. If about a third of the way through you couldn't figure out exactly where each character was going to end up, you weren't trying.3. The dialogue. Who talks like that? Specifically, the American man and the German woman's dialogue sounded like they were speaking two centuries ago. I haven't read dialogue that bad since I tried reading a Left Behind book.I'm tempted to give Ms. Binchy another shot. She seems to have many devoted readers, and they too have expressed their disappointment with this novel. I sincerely hope that this book was not representative of the rest of her work."
2,Typical Binchy of Late,"I am not sure why I keep reading Maeve Binchy's novels. I guess I am hoping that one of the ones I have read: Evening Class, Scarlet Feather, Quentins and now Nights of Rain and Stars will compare to the books that made me a Binchy fan in the first place. How could an author who wrote such books as A Circle of Friends write such one dimensional drivel as in these later works? Does she not know any other adjectives other than ""sad"", ""happy"" or ""poor""? You can almost predict the plot. I am afraid this will be the last one for me."
2,i can't believe that MB wrote this book,It is sooo boring and predictable and the characters are not at all likeable. Maeve Binchy is one of my favorite authors and this is the only book of hers which i did not like. I just can't believe it is her. I loved Glass Lake and Quentins and Evening Class.
1,My first and last Binchy,"I picked this book at up at a discount price. Loved the dust jacket and looked forward to reading a novel set in Greece. Thank goodness, I'd be more upset if I paid full price for it.How many times can an author use the word ""companionable""? A dozen or so, no kidding. My biggest complaint is her insistance on describing what her charactor's dialogue has already established. If they are having a friendly conversation then you don't have to tell me that they walked/sat companionably or any of the other odd words she was compelled to use. Speaking of dialogue - I found almost every conversation unbelievable and therefore her charactors pretty boring and unlikable. Don't writers have editors any more? I am tempted to take a red pen to it and send it back to her publisher.Maybe if I was 13 I would have liked this book. I will never be able to read another one of her books."
3,Maeve disappoints!,"I was genuinely disappointed in Maeve Binchy's latest offereing, Nights of Rain and Stars. I thought the characters were poorly developed and not nearly as interesting as in previous books. The plot was thin and there wasn't the ""smile on my face"" pleasure that I usually derive from her books. I was glad to get to the end of this one. I hope her next book reveals a return of her delicious talent."
5,A Refreshing Change,This novel is a bit different from Binchy's others. The uplifting tone and Greek setting will draw you into the inner circle of the four characters' meeting.
3,"Engaging, but no classic","I've been a long-time Binchy fan, and I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed with her latest work. The characters seemed stilted and forced to fit the story. Also, I repeatedly had the feeling that I was being introduced to these characters just to set up the sequel. Not the worst book I've read, but possibly the worst by Ms. Binchy."
2,Not at all impressed,"This is my first Binchy book and had I not read rave reviews about some of her other books, this would have to be my last. The setting was wonderful, but the story line weak and frankly not too realistic. In my opinion the dialogue between the characters was stilted and didn't ""flow"" and they (the characters) were never fleshed out...no depth at all; also the book kept jumping back and forth to what was happening in each of their lives so much that it was almost like watching a slide show. The lessons learned by each of the characters was noteworthy and I'll probably try to read one of Ms. Binchy's older books that I've heard good things about, but this one truly wasn't worth it and I finished it only because I don't like leaving things undone. This must have been published only because it was a ""Binchy"" because otherwise I can't imagine an editor/publisher bothering with it."
2,sad disappointment,"Although I had briefly scanned some bad reviews of this novel by one of my favorite authors, Maeve Binchy, I decided to ignore them, and checked it out of my local library. I really tried to stick with it, but was sadly disappointed. I was hoping that some of the other reviewers had overstated the decline in the quality of Binchy's writing, but they did not exaggerate. It's hard for me to believe that, given the wonderful character development and plots of her earlier novels, this one was so poorly drawn. Is she simply fulfilling an obligation for a certain number of novels, perhaps?The 'heart' of Binchy is missing from this one. I couldn't even finish the book, giving up at not quite the halfway point. It's a huge disappointment, because I've always savored Maeve Binchy's books, especially her earlier works which took place in Ireland."
2,Not Binchy's best,"I did not enjoy this book. I loved Tara Road and The Scarlet Feather, but found no such affinity for this one. I, like other reviewers here, found the characters to be stilted and unbelievable. In the first few pages I was thinking to myself, who reveals this much of themselves to a complete stranger? I just did not believe in the people. For me that is the crucial part of a story.I have another Maeve Binchy book on my shelf, The Quentins, and I hope it doesn't disappoint me as this one did."
3,"An Easy, Comfort Read","Although not up to the standards of her ealier works, Maeve Binchy offers some light, undemanding reading with this one. There are no surprises and the outcome of each character's story is predictable. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that the story could have benefitted from a more thorough edit. There were several instances of a non-Irish character using Irish speech patterns. The short chapters and simple plotlines make this a good choice for anyone looking for something to read that won't demand too much time or thought."
5,Great Book,I bought this book for my mom and she just loved it. I browsed it myself and its very informative. My mom found it very helpful in explaining her Diverticulitis.
4,A very good camera!,It is a very good camera. Would have given it a 5 except for the limited optical zoom. Extremely easy to use and thakes great pictures. I use it allot for macro mode pictures and they come out super. The battery life is amazing. I have a fuji 4700 digital that requies a battery change after only a few macro photos.....this sucker takes hundreds on one charge!
5,Nice find for the price,This is a great camera for the price. I was looking to upgrade from a 4mp camera and was a bit worried because the price was so low. I use the camera for fun so I wasn't too concerned about all the extras. This one has alot of nice extras and it' really easy to use.
4,How do i Charge it?,The camera is great. I bought it at a store that is going out of business for 40 dollars!! Only problem is i have NO i dea how to charge it... i didn't come with an outlet plug. It just came with a USB cord and (i'm guessing) a cord with yellow and white plugs to upload videos. Can't even go to the store and talk to them cause it's out of business!!!!! oh well that's what I get for such a good deal i guess.
2,external battery not convenient,"I had the old 3.2 mpeg Exilim for years and recently upgraded to this one.It was not obvious when I did the research to buy this, but the external battery charger turned out to not be a good idea. Unless you have 2 batteries to switch around.The problem1. you take battery out to recharge2. say you leave the battery in the charger for a few days3. put battery back into camera, everything resets and the camera asks you to enter date/time again. urgh... annoying...I still like the Exilim, but just wished I didn't get one with external battery."
2,LCD cracked for no apparent reason,"I have had the camera since Febuary and while it does take great pictures, I opened the case yesterday to find the LCD cracked. To replace this would be $150.00 minimum which is half the price I paid. I did not drop it, it was in the case in my purse. Apparently after speaking with Casio you are not supposed to put it in a purse or in a suitcase. Well this will not work for me and I have never heard of such. I have to have something more durable. I am basically out 276.00 which is what I paid in Febuary. Its too bad because it did take great pictures and was very compact, just too fragile."
2,Vertical lines on LCD screen,"I own several great digital cameras. It seems like I get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. This one I wanted for the high MP in a small compact size that I can put into my pocket. The first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out. When I download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. I've played around with the settings (and I do know how to work them) but still it does the same.So time to return to find a better one. That's too bad since I read some good reviews and wanted to have it."
3,"Love Casio, just not this particular one","Short & sweet: the camera takes BEAUTIFUL outdoor pictures (or any in-door photos not requiring a flash), but once you get into an indoor photo-situation, the flash seemed to be poor, the colors not true, and a LOT of digital noise in low-light situations. Also, the anti-shake didnt give the protection that I thought it should have; still some blurry shots with minimal shake. Loved the cradle to charge & upload, and loved the big screen. I guess that I might have been expecting too much, but given that this is their ""flagship"" camera, and given the price, I just didnt feel that the value for the dollar was there.My previous camera was a Casio EX-Z57, and I really feel that it was a better camera than the Z1000 (I banged the screen and cracked the LCD layer, rendering it useless, else I would still have it).A very good camera, but not a great one. A lower price-point could help justify its shortcomings, but aren't great photos the ultimate goal?"
5,Great Camera for High Resolution & good quality pictures,"I bought Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 to see its 10.1 MP capability and slim look and now I am very happy with the performance of this camera.In 10.1 MP segment this is perfect choice. Picture quality is really very good especially for high resolution pictures (Large size photo) and Casio Exilim EX-Z1000 have good frame rate to capture video.Overall this is perfect combination of high resolution (Power) and good quality pictures.Box includes rechargeable Battery, Charger, Dock (Cradle), USB cable."
3,Casio Exilim EX-Z1000,Overall a good camera for users who want an easy to use point and shoot digital camera with a large LCD screen. The video quality could be better though because it only records at 25 frames per second.
3,Strange that it is 3500lb rated,"I missed that this was rated for only 3500 lbs when I ordered it. I only need it to tow 3500 lbs by chance, but I ordered another one (4 inch drop) that has identical steel and weld construction that is 7500 lbs rating, so this really makes no sense. My guess is Master Lock is being lazy and didn't really test it for anything greater. I towed my 3500 lb tent trailer with this over 1200 miles so far including rough unpaved forest service roads and no problems. Not even a paint scratch."
5,Comforting Thoughts,"Perfect book for those moments when the tragic events of September 11 overwhelm me. It's filled with inspirational, practical, and often provocative ideas to think about. I know about a dozen people who should have their own copy--so, with Christmas coming, I know what to do!"
1,Yuck,"I read this book out of curiousity. Harold Bloom is undoubtedly one of the great literary critics of recent times--what would his own fiction read like?Ugh. This book is cast in the mythological prose of a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast. This is low quality fantasy. The real star of the book is Bloom's eccentric philosophy of Gnosticism and no thought at all is given to characterization or euphony of language. I think Bloom is trying to write a new testament here, not a novel. He fails. This is an embarrassing piece of work.Do try his criticism, though. When Bloom is on his home court, he's engaging."
3,Well-written but maybe not so interesting,"The book is well-researched and well-written, and definitely opened my eyes to a whole age of inquiry and discovery about which I was not much aware. However, ultimately I found the subject of geology to be, well, just not very captivating.I can only assume that if you find geology a more engaging subject, you should add at least one star to my review."
1,Historical Hogwash,"It might be a nice little book if any of it were actually based in reality. Yes, the author is right that if Hutton had challenged the dominant mode of thought to create a new science and been the first person to challenge the biblical time-scale and the story of the flood, that he should be mentioned in the same breath as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and the other greats...BUT HE DIDN'T!All of this had been already covered to varying degrees by many different scientists for only about oh, the last 100 years by the time Hutton showed up on the scene. He is in no way a founder of geology, he is only an important and early contributor.So regardless of whether the book is well written or not, the entire foundation for what it has to say is completely false, and thus completely worthless."
1,Buy New Deal instead,"My wife and I have seen Wes in concert several times over the last twelve years, and listen to his albums often. Neither of us could fight our way through this album. The lyrics show a complete lack of imagination. I wish that I could comfort myself in the fact that this album will bring his music to a larger audience, but I don't believe that is the case."
2,Nothing new or interesting.,"I found The Confessions of St. Ace disappointing. I wouldn't say it is truly bad, but the weak lyrics and tired melodies make it boring. John Wesley Harding sounds like a poor imitation of Elvis Costello. I'd file this under ""not worth listening to."""
3,The past is prologue,"For those of us interested in the New Thought movement, this book is a must. It's size can be overwhelming and yet the detail and careful preservation of the names of those who came before us is amazing. In these days of instant everything, it is helpful to be reminded of those who took time, made the effort, strove ahead through all kinds of challenges, to bring a way of living in the world to our attention. I highly recommend that this book be on your library book shelves, not only for reference purposes but as a living memorial to these inspired and inspiring women and men."
3,"Overall comfort pretty good, the bottom seat contact surface is a bit soft and subject to friction breakdown. Shipped with",The bottom seat contact surface is a bit soft and subject to friction breakdown. Attachment elastic works well. Sheepskin cover is nice.
5,WOW !!!,"I would give this CD a thousand stars *************The music is awesome and her voice blows me away. Is not for just one type of listener. Romantic rythms,latin rythms, pop rythms, rock rythms, you will love it!!"
4,Surprisingly good!!,"From the heartfelt ballads to the rock songs (specially Emotional Rescue), everything has a personal touch: unique and powerful voice and amazing guitars that give this album a sort of pure-rock mood; definitely not a basic latin music album. After owning this cd, other cds in my collection will become drink coasters."
5,Harmer comes into her own,"Sarah Harmer's You Were Here is an excellent offering from a potentially future star. Anyone who enjoys Shawn Colvin will also like Harmer. Her pop/folk vocals are mesmerizing and heart filled. Her music is not overdone as many productions of today are. Her music is simple enough to enjoy it for what it is, without becomeing too complex. the easy listeneing of Harmer's vocals over the instrumentals of each song finds the rare prefect balance. I recomend this CD to anyone thinking of buying it. I truly believe in time that people will know about Sarah Harmer and her pop/folk music will become quite popular and make her the star that she should be."
5,"Awesome, truly the Best ever CD","I don't buy a lot of music. But, by chance, I found this one. The first song got me. When I first listened to all the songs I wasn't totally sold. I can't figure out why because now it is one of my all time favorites. You've got to try it. It's a welcome, beautiful difference to the norm."
5,Underated star,This cd grows on you big time.Sarah can change the tempo so quickly and well. I like almost every song and rate it right up there with Emm Gryner another Canadian star.
2,Needs Work,"Despite the overheated push, this is only a so-so album. Harmer has a bland, emotionally neutral voice, and the material is very weak. This is no song here you could call a potential single. Less hard sell and more effort on the singer's part for the next record will be more heplful in the long run."
2,Off key,"Listen closely and you'll notice that she slips off key several times during the second half of ""Lodestar,"" betraying a weakness in her voice and ear. It would've been a nice song had it ended halfway through."
4,Another Canadian Gem,"This is a great CD from a gifted Canadian vocalist and Musician. Sarah Harmer has never been afraid to explore different types of music or instrumentation from album to album or even song to song...that is evident on this well-crafted CD.The lead off song ""Around this Corner"" is my favorite track on the CD. It will having you singing along after just a play or two. What other pop song can you think of off the top of your head that has a clarinet solo in it?Other highlights include ""Basemant Apartment,"" ""Uniform Gray"" and Coffee Stain."" This is a wonderfull listen from start to finish crafted by a great artist. Listen to all of her CD's and see for yourself the versatility that she has. Even better, if you have the chance...catch her live show! You will not be sorry you spent the money on the ticket."
5,Fantastic.,"I recently picked up this album and loved it so much that I bought her newer album too. While there are some very good songs on ""All of Our Names"", for me, this is far and away the more complete work.If anyone out there enjoyed Pater Malick's collaborative album ""Chance & Circumstance"" this work has a similar variety of songs and styles from the stand-out hit ""Basement Apartment"" to the initially quirky but ultimately superb ""Lodestar"" - a song that must be listened to the whole way through.I'm a picky soul and there aren't too many albums that have made it 'uncut' onto my iPod, this is one."
5,One of the BEST CDs.,I was walking through a local CD store a few years ago and saw Sarah Harmer's face looking at me. I picked up the CD and just decided to buy it. I haven't regreted it for one second. I LOVE this CD. Her voice is beautiful. Her songs are catchy. She has since become one of my favorite artists. I wish she had many more CDs.
5,Perfect in every way!!,"Okay, maybe I was a little disappointed in the small size but everything else is just perfect. Every page in the Old Testament and New Testament has a short verse in rhyme that reads the significance of a particular person in the bible. It's short and right to the point! The illustrations are beautiful and the pages are good quality. If there was a board book version, I would have bought this for my 13 month old son a lot sooner. This is his actual ""first"" bible and I'm including it in his Easter basket. Would also make an excellent Baptism gift."
4,Great gift!,"Great first illustrative bible as a first gift... This may not be THE very first bible, but, it's an illustrative story book. I think it's great for kids. I gave this to my godson as a christening gift."
2,Great Book - Horrible Translation,"I love the book. As it was written by Howard Zinn.I can't believe that such a bad translation could be accepted by the editors.I know Spanish. I wanted one of my relatives in South America to appreciate it as much as I do.After browsing through a few pages, I realized that the translation is completely amateurish, uninteresting, and often plain wrong.What a pity. Please have this translated properly and re-publish it. The audience out is tremendous and in bad need of such a great book."
4,"I have got the book in a shorter time, and I really like it, The white pages i dislike but that is only a prefference.","The color and quality of the paper,I disliked, I preffer yelow paper instead ob white, but that is only a prefference. The translation is good. and the theme is quite interesting. Besides the author, is known and is really like him."
5,Exactly what I needed,Not much to complain about here. These 120mm fan shrouds are great and serve the purpose I need them for. Arrived exactly as described.
4,Doesn't include screws all the time,Keeps the cables out of my fans but didn't come with screws. The eyelits are slightly lowered to give the fan clearance from the grill.
4,Roc Tien scores again,"Roc Tien does a stellor job here as a lone dark swordsman with no attachment to anything or any body, his life depends on how far his sword can carry him. Roc uses a Japanese type of sword fighting technique in this film that works well with the demeaner of his character."
5,Oh Boy...This record is Tight.,"To everyone in the Bay to La...Don Cisco ""Oh Boy"" is tight. Brown pride...Cisco shows us he has what it takes to get to the top. Check out Mamacita (Next Friday)...Guajira is da bomb. Buy this one!"
1,Worthless junk,"Legend strikes again, colorized garbage and ""restored"" B&W that isn't restored, just the color turned off. And most of this isn't ""television"" stuff at all, it's the same old theatrical public domain shorts (""Disorder in the Court"", anyone?) that we've seen over and over and over. I don't know why this company still bothers. Junk."
2,Breakable,Almost every piece in this set is broken only one year after buying. It looks pretty but simply can not hold up to the wear and tear of a 4 and 7 year old. Will look to buy a more durable set.
4,creative and well made doll house furniture,Most creative and well made of any doll house furniture I have seen.Eye catching for my grand daughter. Fosters her imagination.Does have small working doors and drawers.Each room of furniture comes very well packaged.
3,Broken,Several items arrived broken in the packages. The furniture is adorable but very delicate. I'm not sure it will withstand a 4 year old playing with it daily.
4,DollhouseFurniture,"Decent quality overall. The toilet seat was broken, but everything else came in good shape. The kitchen furniture just barely fits in the kitchen though. We purchased the Melissa and Dough Victorian dollhouse also. The rest of the furniture fit fine in the house."
5,Very good doll house furniture.,The furnniture arrived in good condition and I was delighted with the quality and detail. It goes so well in the Victorian house.
5,"Excellent,Adventurous,facinating","Thomas E. Simmons has done excellent research work on this book, ""The Brown Condor"" I have been doing my own research and found it difficult to get accurate information. But this author has spent 8yrs of excellent work and has managed to tie all the information together so well I thought I was watching an exciting action pack Movie of very high quality. This Book should be made into a Movie. I truly love it."
5,Great jazz and r&b sax!,"The focus of this collection is on two dates made by Al Sears. His band features Ellingtonians, and are probably the finest recordings Sears made under his own name. Also featured is Wild Bill Moore and his swinging octet. Moore's characteristic upper register playing and unusual tone grace all his tracks. While he was widely known and influential, especially for his recordings with Paul ""Hucklebuck"" Williams, Moore has not been well represented on LP or CD re-issues. His presence here is indeed welcome."
1,Where's the underground?,"This album is another example of crap compilations. Where's the Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Television, or even the Ramones? This CD is completely one sided."
5,Beautifully photographed with great ideas,I love this book! As an avid junk collector (much to the humour of my family!) I found this book to become one of my favourites.I have read this book so many times- there are just so many inspiring pictures in this book. The book contains many different interiors and all different types of junk style. A great book.
2,OK but not the best of this genre,"I am an antiquer and flea market junkie. This book is OK, but it isn't the best. (I also don't like the word ""junk."") The points this book makes about mixing things and repurposing things is better made in Flea Market Decorating, a book which also shows a broader variety of locations types as well as flea markets from around the country. I also like the original American Junk book, but it only shows objects versus nice big photos of real rooms."
4,Saint Saga #27,"1948's ""Call for the Saint"" marks a partial, but nonetheless welcome, return to the old (1930s) Saint from the sanitised and lobotomised G-man of the War years.In the first story, set in Chicago, the Saint works to find the brain behind a protection racket; in the second, he unravels the mystery behind the rise of an apparently talentless New York boxer.Both stories, unusually at this late date, also feature Patricia Holm and Hoppy Uniatz — the latter in particularly fine form.P.S. For a list of — and discussion of — all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
5,TIGGER DECAL STICKER,"I got my first Tigger decal sticker as a gift, placed it on my car window and it stayed there with no peeling or fading for 10 years. He finally got to old and had trouble sticking there so I ordered a new one with NO hesitation. I have a new one displayed now and ready to enjoy another 10 years. ENJOY YOURS"
4,what ever happened to volume two?,"This book is exactly what it says it is: the BACKGROUND to the rebellion of An Lushan. In other words, it gives you everything that leads up to the rebellion, and then pulls the plug and leaves you hanging high and dry. He mentions several times in the text that the rebellion itself would be covered in volume two, but apparently volume two never got written. Which is a shame, because the rebellion is what we really want to learn about. It would be like reading a book about the Alamo that ended just when Santa Anna was first approaching the Rio Grande and had not yet even entered into Texas. Still, it has some interesting insights into the economics, politics, and military organization of Tang China, so it's not a complete waste of time."
5,Great tip but not jumbo,"This is a great tip for icing mini cupcakes, brownies, etc. but it is not a Jumbo tip for icing regular sized cupcakes. If you want a large icing tip for bakery looking cupcakes go with a bigger tip. Love it for mini's!"
3,Not as Extra Large as I thought,"The tip was not quite as extra large as the description says. The packaging the tip came in did not keep it from getting bent. It came almost bent together, so I had to try and round it back out without breaking it. It is an ok size but I still wish it was larger. I suggest this company package their materials better when shipping."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I have a 2A tip and found it to do the trick... But wasn't what I wanted exactly. This tip however, is PERFECT! Extra large indeed. Glad I found it!"
5,Perfect size for frosting cupcakes,I used this Tip with the disposable bags and tried both homemade frosting and frosting from a can the tip and bag combo worked great. Easy for a beginner like me to use.
5,Perfect,Loved it! Exactly what I was looking for. Piped beautifully on the cupcakes I made for my son's baptism. I got a lot of complements.
3,Low simmer suspense,"Don has been living a life of a loner. A janitor at a high school, he hides a secret and because of that he has not visited the town that he grew up in for many years. A former flame ( Elizabeth Shue)pleads with him to come back home to spend time with her as she is terminally ill. As he returns, he is immediately sucked in to a web of deception involving shady characters, murder and suspicion.I thought this movie was just alright and has adequate suspense and intrigue to keep things interesting. Each character was shady and this angle made the movie interesting. In many ways it reminded me of a short story or a play adapted for the big screen. Thomas Haden Church as the clueless character was great and the rest of the characters provided him support. While this may not be the best of suspenseful movies, it was still watchable and the final frame offered closure. Three stars. 01/02/11"
4,Keeps you guessing,"I liked the movie. It is not a fast moving plot, but you are constantly trying to figure out what is going on because things don't add up. You know something is afoot, but the reason is not clear. I like the fact that the movie characters are not super heroes, but more real life and kind of sad people. The ending is a bit lame, but I was thoroughly entertained and thought it was definitely worth watching."
3,Strange and difficult to fathom,"Spoilers.........This is a very weird story of a man who comes back to his hometown, supposedly to reconnect with his lost love, knowing full well that she is not the woman he used to love (she died). This woman is supposedly dying but is obviously healthy, and then two other people get involved in some sort of plan to steal a bunch of money. Oh, and there's a murder or two or three.It is all very odd and disjointed.Church is quite good in his role though Shue is not up to snuff, I think."
1,This is on the BEST of the WORSE films....EVER!,"PURE MST3K fodder. My girlfriend and I couldnt stop making fun of this film. Tries to be NEO-NOIR, then in the middle of the film they say, ok lets be a dark comedy? FAIL! So many HORRIBLE one liners, horrible acting by CHURCH, Shue is so hot in her lingere though so that alone is worth a watch. LAUGHABLE, enjoy ripping this film apart as much as I did."
1,Be prepared to replace it,"Purchased and put into service July 2010, burned out (dramatically) December of 2010. ~60% duty cycle (off overnight). Replaced a Lowe's unit that cost about $15 five or six years ago. Will be replaced with a GE unit. I would not recommend this light to anyone expecting more than six months of life."
2,Short lifespan,"These lights use an electronic ballast that is less than perfect. I use them in jewelry cases, and about 25% of them fail within 6 months. Also, the ""non-yellowing"" lens is not true, the heat yellows the plastic lens fairly quickly. Replacement bulbs will run about $8 to $10 with shipping, so it's almost better to toss the entire unit and replace it when the bulbs go. Still cheaper than halogen lighting, but don't buy it unless you're able to replace it easily."
3,Under Cabient Light,"This light does not last very long. Only had it for about 6 months and bulb has already burned out. Only use it at night when at my deck at home, which is not very often.You have to buy replacement bulbs online. Went to 3 stores and the last store said you had to get them online and with the shipping charges it gets to be a rather expensive bulb."
4,20 Inch Plug-In Fluorescent Light,"After buying 2 new enclosed computer stations that was black I realized that I needed some light. I ordered two of these to add under the tops of the stations. We installed them and was very pleased with the result. It lights up the keyboard and desktop but doesn't cause glare on the computer screen. It gives me just the right amount of light to work at the computer. I would not like to have to work without them. They don't take up space, and are eash to install.I would recommend them to anyone who needs extra light whether under a cabinet or any other place. They also came in black to match my computer station. I'm a happy customer."
1,Hard to find bulbs,Not every hardware store carries the 16 watt T4 MOL: 17in bulbs that are needed to fit into these fixtures. The bulbs are of an unusual length for the wattage and I could only find Warm White or Cool White online (I want Daylight). It seems they made this product to sell customers their brand of bulbs so that I cannot spend my money elsewhere.
5,No one has an imagination like Eric Kroll!,"I think Mr. Kroll displays his amazing ability to capture every woman's beauty with imagination, style and eroticism. What I enjoyed most about Beauty Parade is his concentration on bringing out what the woman in the picture has seemingly always wanted express, but never did until Eric brought it out of her. It truly is a ""coffee table"" book and a conversation piece. Every time I look at it, I see things I didn't see the last time. I highly recommend this book!"
3,really lovely images,"This little book of postcards is full of really beautifully erotic images captured so very well. Granted I tend to feel the one on the cover is possibly the very best of them but they are all cards you would feel very special either sending or recieving! However, it is also such a beautiful little collection of some very fine work that the book itself becomes a little baby master collection on it's own so I know I for one won't be rushing to start deconsolidating the collection from it's book form. If someone wants to see and feel exquisite eroticism and sensuality I'd rather they did it on my coffee table!Cheers"
1,Save your money,"I haven't got a clue as to what genius or artistry people see here. The picture are more of a ""making of"" than an actual book of photography. I am sorely disappointed and wish I could sell it off asap. I see no art or great lighting or imagination here. Sorry to offended fans."
2,BEAUTY PARADE?,"Well, with this title what should I expect? Beauties isn't?, but I think many readers like me would be dissapointed because there are many fetish picts, bizarre picts, women not so beauty as I tough, that's not a bad work, but that's not the promess of the cover, neither the promess of the title.I dont like so much fetichism, so I think I did a bad election."
2,ABC News Nightline Fragile X Syndrome,I bought this DVD thinking it would educate me as the cause of the condition with a view toward identyfying intervention options. The DVD focused on the story of one middle class couple of privilege. Rarely did it touch on issues that were transferable to parents with Fragile X syndrome children in general. This was a very poor investment on my part and I do not recommeded it.
4,hmmmmm....have I heard this before.,"Time Again is a great band from California. They released a E.P. on Rancid Records before moving to Hellcat and releasing this fine peice of music art. People have dogged on them in the past for ripping off Rancid. But Rancid is a good band. And this band just looks up to them. The song writing is a bit like Rancid, but these guys know what its like to really go through what they are talking about in their songs. If you like Rancid then pick this up. If you dont like Rancid dont bother to pick this up because you'll hate it. I love Rancid and I love Time Again. Amazing album"
3,Lost Childhood,"While this book is not as professionally written as ""To Sleep With the Angels,"" Michele McBride describes the deep psychological effect the fire had on her and other survivors. Until reading these two books on the Our Lady of the Angels School fire, I did not realize how badly burned many of the surviving students had been. Severe burns affect the body throughout adulthood. Michele McBride died in July 2001 due to multiple organ breakdown, which perhaps was an offshoot of her injuries in 1958."
4,THE FIRE THAT WILL NOT DIE,"Excellent book, I would read "" To Sleep With The Angels "" first and then this book. That is the order in which I read them and it was very imformative. You get the overall view and then the view of a person that went through this disaster."
4,Burn Victim's Experience,"I read that Michele had to pay to have this book initially published. It's obviously not edited by a professional and there are numerous typos. But it's worth reading just to find out about what she endured in the hospital. Also, the comments made to her by all the people out in public are shocking. She does tend to repeat certain subjects over and over, like her mistrust of people, her anger. And I was surprised to hear about her personality - twice slapping girls in the classroom during the fire - but maybe that's how it was in 1959. I would have liked to hear more about her jobs, her family and seen more photos of her. She mentioned her mother was deaf and came to visit her in the hospital but that was it. Barely any mention of the family when she was able to go home."
3,Burn Victim's Experience,"I was disappointed that there were only a few photos (which were printed on the page, not photo plates). I sympathize greatly with Ms. McBride's experience, which I have no doubt was absolutely terrible. When I received the book, I paged through it and was disappointed with the almost constant repetition of thought-lines that became rather tediious. If one were to cut out the repetition, the book would be about 1/3 its length. Very little is said about the OLA fire itself, and even the months of treatment and recuperation - while one could never say this should be ""interesting"", one would not expect it to be verbosely boring. By contrast, I found ""To Sleep With The Angels"" to be spellbinding and sobering."
2,Mostly concerned with the history of Dallas,"While no reader could possibly doubt the strength and courage of Carol Cook, this book seemed to go into more detail about the history of the city of Dallas then about either Cook or the crimes. I was excited to read this because Cook herself had a hand in writing it and I thought it only served to show what an indomitable woman Cook is that she had the strength to write of her ordeal, but there is really very little about it at all in the entire book. My heart goes out to Cook and all of the other victims but this is the book to read if there's anything you ever wanted to know about the city of Dallas. Except of course the crimes and criminal who terrorized it for so long."
3,A MAELSTROM OF DECEIT,"My wife chose this book and I read it aloud to her. This would be considered true crime, however, any suspense is non-existant as the author only talks about one suspect and no others so you know from page 5 who the culprit is. If others were mentioned as to rape suspects and a little bit of history given to others, then it might have been more interesting.The interesting part of the whole story is how the culprit leads two different and distinct lives for a period of time and then how his personality begins disintegrating toward the end and the ruse used to get a confession out. The major victim is given a roller coaster ride that is heartbreaking."
4,Vinci Alto Sax,Good service from Amazon. Received in just 3 working days. I really like the color of the sax. I don't know how to play now but I will learn.
1,bad product,"I have been using this product for the past couple of weeks, I see no changes on my facial. I'm not happy with this product. =( If i have a choice I will not even GRADE IT AT ALL! Not to be mean but I purchase this item at a mall where I live at. I also purchase the Heel cream to moisturize my feet (also heel) but it does not work at all."
4,All creams take time,"I would recommend this cream to anyone who has dark spots on the skin, but it takes time to eliminate them."
5,Charming book,"I loved the language and stories in this book. It was delightful to be reading history one second and then jumping into a faerie tale. Skye is imbued with the magic of storytelling, which is what we humans seem to do best."
4,Excellent,"Excellent debut by Angel Witch, elite British metal. Most of the vocals are high pitch, comparing favorably to Judas Priest, Iron Maiden or Helloween. It just misses being a classic. Key tracks are Angel Witch, White Witch, Sorceress, Angel of Death, & Sweet Danger. I would recommend it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was charmed by this book's promise of ""thousands of top scholarships"" but was soon very disappointed. After looking through 50 or so scholarships in the book, I noticed that many of them were repeated. For example, on one page they had the same scholarship listed three times! I feel like I purchased a book that contains only a few listing repeated over and over again. Save your money and search the internet for scholarships."
5,You no longer have to miss out on special treats.,"If you thought that you have to miss out on special treats because of food allergies or intolerances, think again! With recipes for everything from Cookies to Wedding Cakes, this book is just what you need. It is a complete guide to cooking special foods for those with food allergies or intolerances. Dr. Fenster writes from her own experience as a culinary professional and as an individual with wheat intolerance. In addition to original recipes, the book contains directions on how to make substitutions in other recipes and where to buy special products such as wheat-free flours. Her list of hidden sources of wheat, gluten, eggs, milk, corn and soy is an invaluable resource for those who need to avoid even small amounts of those foods. This book could help make cooking easy and eating enjoyable again!"
5,Excellent recipe substitutions for Autistic Spectrum Diet!,"This book is of immense value to parents who wish to implement the new gluten and casein free diet. New scientific studies on autism are indicating a relationship between the digestive system and the brain. (autistic enterocolitus) Parents substituting wheat (gluten) and dairy (casein) in their children's diet will find wonderful recipes for dietary substitutions. This book and the diet it supports are leading the way to bringing many children who fall within the autism spectrum back into our world. Judy DeHart Editor, GFCFdiet.com"
3,Ragtag collection,"I admit to being primarily a fan of the Lone Justice phase of Maria McKee's career, and the tracks from that band are poorly chosen here. Great songs like ""East of Eden"" and ""I Found Love"" aren't present, and songs that were uninteresting (""Sweet Sweet Baby"") or boring curiosities (""Sweet Jane"") are included. Songs not found on her solo albums like ""Red Dress"" are must-haves for a serious fan, but with so much focus on Lone Justice, I think it would be better to have the ""This World Is Not My Home"" Lone Justice compilation. And to either wait for a compilation containing more of her solo material or to buy the CD's themselves..."
3,unlikely to win converts with this one,"Robert Christgau once wrote that Steve Winwood is what happens when one has more talent than brains. Listening to this CD evokes a similar response.Maria McKee possesses undeniable talent and beauty. If she had been born 50 years earlier, some studio or Svengali producer would have surely harnessed that talent and beauty and made her a star. However, it appears that her career has been left to her own devices yielding this highly uneven collection and less than household name recognition.The amber warning light goes off when one realizes that some of the strongest material a) was written by others, and b) is off the first Lone Justice album, before that band first splintered then collapsed. Although McKee has put out some good solo material, it is much more hit and miss. The collection reaches its nadir with a pointless live cover of ""Sweet Jane."""
3,"To my ears, a shrill sound in the string section","I am listening to this recording as I type this review. I had to adjust the volume down because I find the sound of the strings in fortissimo to be a bit shrill. The performance is fine, but the recording quality is a touch harsh to my ears. I am listening on good equipment: McIntosh C2200 tubed pre-amp, MC352 power amp, and a Marantz SA-11S1 Super Audio CD player, through Sonus Faber speakers and a Mac sub-woofer. I normally like Telarc recordings, and I like this one as well to a point, but I vastly prefer the sound on the Leinsdorf, Erich / Los Angeles Philharmonic Sheffield Lab recording of 1978. I think this Telarc disc could use a touch of ""warming"" to reduce some of the harshness in the upper strings. I see it is no longer in print, and no longer available new, so it had a very short shelf life."
2,Big Disappointment,"I have a number of other versions of Romeo and Juliet and bought this one for the novelty of the DSD direct recording. I wish I hadn't. The problem isn't with the new format, but more fundamentally with the mix. The mid-range is muffled, when one can hear it at all. This lamentable defect is all the more striking by the clarity of the percussion and violins. Those wishing a good SACD/DVD audio recording are advised to pass; there are too many great straight CD recordings already available to waste your money on this."
2,Not what I expected,"The instructions on this toy say to ""pull the tail and spin,"" which made me believe it had a slingshot-type launching mechanism. It doesn't. It actually has a pull string with a handle at the end, and you launch the toy by pulling the string and swinging the toy over your head, around and around, then letting go. Not meant for indoor play, obviously."
2,Fling-Flung-Flop,"I have a large golden retriever who loves his toys - sometimes to death. The Fling-it Pig is cute but not a great indoor toy. The 'reel' inside is a bit heavy and it makes you cringe when a bad toss slams it into a wall. My dog figured out that the ""tail"" pulls out . . . and that was great fun until a few tugs later when he pulled it out permanently. That ended piggy's flying days and life got very short when the back seam ripped open and the ""guts"" started coming out. Piggy just wasn't tough enough."
2,Not as great as I was hoping,"I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but I know this wasn't it. My dog can't play with it because it is way too big and the throwing device doesn't work any better than my own arm."
3,Buy the season set in August 2008 + This for complete season,"This only contains the first 3 episodes of the series. Season 1 boxset is coming out on August 19 2008 for about $20, which will include the remaining 13 episodes (episodes 4-16). These episodes, from what I hear on TFW2005 site says will not be included in the season 1 boxset.This is a fantastic series, and being a fan of the original, you will notice a lot of references to G1 that casual viewers would miss. I will not post any of those here as it might be spoilers to those who have not yet seen the series.I highly recommend viewers to give this series a chance, you will be surprised at how cleaver and entertaining it is.My 3 star ranking is based on the fact that they are not including extras, and separating the first season into 2 packages instead of releasing them all at once. The show gets 5 stars."
4,It's ok.,"This is an alright movie, but I have seen better. But in my son's opinion at age 5, he loves it!"
2,How does one attach it?,"I am a little confused by S.L.'s review,""I had a moment of angst while attaching this strap: Would I look pretentious carrying a point and shoot camera around on a thick leather strap that looks like it was made for a professional grade DSLR? Well, this concern quickly evaporated when I actually started carrying the camera.""This strap ships without the means to attach it to a point and shoot camera, which in my case is a Canon S95. So unless S.L. has a secret way of connecting it, I fail to see how he attached it. I have been sitting here struggling with continuous key-rings and other test solutions, but so far, nothing works. This strap is meant for a big DSLR. I bought it based upon reviews from the people who said they use it with their point and shoots cameras. FAIL."
4,Strap for Canon Powershot,It was a good fit for my camera. I use it and it does what it is supposed to do.
1,Trash,"This book is beyond worthless. Some of the selected readings are good, but the book itself is riddled with typos and misspellings. Further, whoever wrote the questions, comments and definitions in this book simply didn't take their job seriously. For example, in one of the essays (""Extremely Cool"" by A.J. Jacobs [not a good essay]), the author refers to ""street lugers"". The editor felt that the word ""luger"" needed to be defined for students, so if you follow up on it, you'll find a definition that reads: ""Luger: a semi-automatic German pistol."" Honestly, that's just the tip of the iceberg. It should be considered a crime to force students to pay money for this worthless piece of trash. If you want to use a reading from this book, I suggest going to the source and photocopying; don't encourage the people who concocted this monstrosity by handing them more money."
2,Where's Usher?,"What a disappointment! I rented this movie expecting popular recording star Usher to have a starring role. Imagine my dismay, when I watched the movie and realized that Usher isn't even in the movie. OMG.On a serious note, David Decoteau's House of Usher has plenty of hot guys exposing their nipples, but the plot is very dull. For a better Decoteau movie, check out Sorority Babes In The Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama or Nightmare Sisters. Those might be old, but they are a lot more fun than this one."
2,Don't Bother,A bit disturbing...not the story...the directing and most acting. I thought the cast was very easy on the eyes (hence the two stars and not just one) but the story was distracting and was written like a 70's porno (all you need is a theme and a title) but without the sex. I would recommend you pass on this one.
2,Not all that. Expected more from here! networks.,"Attractive actors seemed to be the highlight of the show. The ACTING was a bit uncomfortable, almost high school play-style or home-movie acting. Rated-R for same-sex make-out sessions, rubbing up and down bare chests, and a few bare-butt shots. Nothing frontal and nothing simulated as in other ""here! network"" productions."
2,Edgar Alan Poe's House of Usher remake.,"Very thin story line. Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ending. Trite to the max. If you want to see it, rent it somewhere."
4,Not the best but definitely not the worst.,"I liked this movie. There was a tension in the movie, but it wasn't fear or horror. It was a sensual angst or frustration through the whole movie. Though I don't care much for the ending, the movie as a whole is really a 3.75 or so. Not great, but definitely not bad."
3,so so,"This movie was ok. It was too conflicted on what it wanted to be and where it was going. The guys where hott but not in it enough to push it beyond, so so."
5,Great value for price,"Pretty nice 'n classy. All fixtures included for attachment to the wall. Clean, clear and crisp reflection. No funny glass problems, even distributed glass and coating. Also has a plain mirror at the back."
5,scott's review,"I saw a 3X one in a hotel and looked it up online and bought the 5X one, I'm glad I got the 5X. I'd be interested to see what the 10X one is like, but it may be 'too much'. It is really nice to use to find 'missed hairs' and whatever blemishes one wants to look for! My wife and daughter really like it!"
4,"Importance of Schelling's ""Philosophy of Art""","Conceptual frame: This is the only edition of Schellings's overall view of Art. The only way to have art is through Philosophy and Schelling expresses this implicitly in his work. This book is a thorough example of how romanticism and transcendnetalism can communicate. For anyone interested in Aesthetics this book is necessary - it shows how Aesthetics are infinitized. Technical frame: The book is 342 pages plus 55 pages of Foreword and Translator's introduction; it includes notes, bibliography, and index, and is divided into two basic parts - General section of the Philosophy of Art and Specific section of the Philosophy of Art."
2,Works until Warranty expires,Worked while under warranty . I got 1 year more . Did not abuse and used occasionally while reading. Received about 1.75 years of use. Take this into account when evaluating . From the reviews on Amazon others have had this problem.
4,My wife loved it for the 2+ years it lasted...,"I bought this here on Amazon in November 2007 for my wife for $80. My wife found it very easy to use, and she used it a lot since then. The display was only average, but it really worked fine until about a month ago. It stopped working completely, so we replaced the batteries, but when we powered it back on it had a series of lines running through the text, almost like an invisible bar-code, making it virtually unreadable. Still, in this age of planned obsolescence I guess 2 1/2 years isn't bad for an $80 gadget. So I'm actually buying her another one for her birthday. Along with a paperback pocket dictionary to use as a back up. :)"
4,Useful,I am in Chiropractic school and was hoping that it had some more medical health terms. It has alot of content but there are a few times that I was looking for something that was not there. It is very useful though.
5,excellent dictionary,"This is a perfect dictionary for someone who wants to know what words mean. I had never gotten an electronic dictionary because they were too ""dinky"" meaning the definitions were only synonyms and not complete. This dictionary is complete and better then any I have found so far."
2,"Too much money, buy a cheaper one..","I have owned a few electronic dictionaries over the yrs. and this one is alright. The cost is too much, cheaper electronic dictionaries have word games, this one don't. Had it for a little over a year and I thought the battery was bad. Replaced it and still nothing!! So it's broke. I have some older cheap ones still around, guess I'm going back to them...Think about this, if it was waterproof I still wouldn't buy it. I say this cause I use this dictionary outdoors alot..Junk, don't buy!"
2,crapped out after 18 months,"This was such an awesome electronic dictionary. But it randomly stopped working after about a year and a half. Similar to other reviews where this has happened, the screen just randomly went blank. After fiddling with the battery, the screen would come on asking me if I wanted to initialize, then it would go blank again if I touched it wrong. I think it's some kind of issue with the battery compartment, who knows. Considering that the exact same thing has happened to other reviewers, I'm guessing this is a fairly common occurrence for anyone who has used this product for over a year. It's a well designed dictionary, but it's just not built to last."
2,Good but bad dispaly function - lines appear after average use,"The product is really good. And easy to use.The only problem that will make you mad after getting in love with this product is that it doesn't last more than a year and half (let's say I am an average user). Really, I bought first one and after a year the LCD was not functioning good and I hardly read the text, then I bought another one it lasted only for a year and half for the same problem - the problem is that lines appear on the display where you can't read text!! I checked reviews on the internet and some people facing same problem.Although I loved it, but it is so stupid to buy the product for the 3rd time.In brief, if there is a warranty for 3 years for this product, then go for it, otherwise forget it and try 2nd best dictionaries - in my opinion - ""Franklin SCD-2100"" which in some site rated number 1. Both have same price."
5,Absolutely Perfect,"When I was looking for a pocket dictionary, I came across this item. I read the reviews and there was not one bad review about it. So, I took a chance and bought it. IT IS THE BEST!! Speaking as a student, I like something that makes my life a little easier & as an avid reader this dicitionary is perfect for looking up words I come across. Some of the things I was not sure of, was whether the sound could be turned off, or if it had a wide range of words. It turns out that you can shut the sound off, AND here are some of the words I typed in:LYCANTHROPY BELL'S PALSY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY HABERDASHERYHABERGON PRONATOR ZAMINDARI SUPINATEFLOCCINAUCINIHILIPILIFICATION (TRUST ME IT IS A WORD!)Believe me if a pocket dictionary can spell and have a definition for this word, it has to be good.You can make the text larger, and can search a word's meaning within the definition with THE QUICK VIEW. I LOVE THIS DICTIONARY, Best one in the Market!!"
3,"dig it, but durability is questionable, and possibly outdated.","I treat my electronics pretty well, but only about a year into owning this and not using it as often as i should there is a defect that comes and goes: A vertical line the color of the background has appeared in one spot. Depending on what letter it crosses it can make it pretty difficult to read.This is by far the best most comprehensive device solely for dictionary/thesaurus/grammar, but considering the applications that you can download for your cell phone, i'm beginning to think it makes little sense to have a device like this.I also prefer the merrium-webster dictionary to the oxford. But this is still good."
2,"Works Great, DOESN'T Last a Long Time!","I bought this unit about a year and a half ago, and soon couldn't understand how I ever lived without it. The dictionary is quite complete -- I haven't had to go to my OED but maybe once or twice since getting it. The definitions tend to be on the terse side, but not ridiculously so.The thesaurus is just okay, but I've been spoiled by my vintage 1957 Roget's, which is SO much better than what they slap that name on these days.So why the negative review? After a year and a half of being my trusty writing desk sidekick it just quit. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't do anything. New battery and jabbing the reset doohickey do nothing. Naturally the warranty is only for a year. If this was a $15 item I'd grumble and get another one, but at $80 I shudder to think what my cost per lookup came out to!Now I can't live without one of these little gadgets, but I'll be trying a different brand. Hope I can find one that's as good as this and actually lasts awhile!"
4,Please answer my question,"I'd like to know if the explanations of the words are in easy way to be understand, because I live in Brazil and I'm an intermediate student.Thanks very much"
3,I use it everyday,"One of the wisest purchases I ever made. I've ben using it for years almost everyday.Update: The screen display gets corrupted and I keep buying new ones, but the last one I purchesed didn't even last a month. So I'm looking for another dictionary."
5,a great electronic helper,I was pleasantly surprised at the complexity and completeness of the information available in this device. It is a splendid companion to me in my reading and crossword pursuits. It is also helpful with British word usage which is sometimes different than american usage.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SHARP DICTIONARY!!,"I bought this product from Amazon. This dictionary lasted less than six months. It began to have lines and blank spaces on the screen. At first I thought it was the battery. Dind't help when I put new ones in. And then the thing went completely blank and nothing I did brought it back. Why is Amazon selling this defective product? I have read other reviews that have mentioned this occurence with the dictionary.OK......so I call Sharp Industries. They no longer make this dictionary but if I send them my proof of purchse they will look into it. I did and haven't heard back, even with my repeated emails.So......if you are reading this review, be warned. The product is defected and a waste of your money. It cost too much to be this bad."
5,impulsive looker-upper,"This is really a nice little addition to my reading. Instead of jotting down a word or words to look up later, I now have the Sharp E500 in my shirt pocket. It also helps when writing away from my computer. The only thing I would have wished they added is a word game like ""Hangman"" to pass the time when stuck in a waiting room etc."
4,A good dictionary PWE550.,"I like this product very much. I like the button""Super jump"" very much.It is easy to use. PWE550 is a great dictionary."
2,Not For Crossword Puzzles,"While the E550 is a good dictionary it's crossword puzzle functions leave a lot to be desired. Most crossword clues are two or three words which the E550 will allow (phrase search) but always the search comes up empty. In working with Sharp's customer service they admitted the E550 can only be used for the easiest of puzzles. I would agreeThe dictionary lookups were quite good. However, there were some strange quirks no only in definitions but displaying similar words.To me the E550 is outdated both in function as well as the display. The LCD is okay but would be significantly better if it had a color display like most cell phones have. I definitely would pay extra for a color display that has more resolution.I would not recommend the E550. It's is in need of an upgrade."
3,It's O.K.......,"It's basically a good product, but I found that the Oxford American Dictionary is far more limited in content than the Merriam-Webster one that is the definition source used in my 20 yr. old Franklin unit..."
1,Definition - Junk,I bought this dictionary about two years ago. I used it three to four times a month to look up word definitions while reading in bed. That works out to less than two hours of total use time over the two years. One day it worked fine and the next time I turned it on there were multiple thick vertical lines going through the entire display. It looked like hieroglyphics - totally unreadable. I changed the battery but that didn't correct it. The bottom line is that this dictionary cost me about $30 an hour to use before it bit the dust. I'm going to buy a different electronic dictionary and look up the work 'junk'. I wouldn't be surprised if the first definition is 'Sharp'.
1,Short Lived Device,"I have actually had three of these. I purchased the initial one for my son. After a couple years it developed lines across the screen similar to dead pixels that made the words illegible. I assumed this was a fluke and ordered two more, one as a replacement, for my son, and another as a gift for my sister. One of these went bad after about nine months and the other after a year. Same problem. I packaged these two up and sent them back to Sharp asking what they could do. I never heard anything back from them. A nice device when it works, but too much money for a product with such a short life from a company with no product support."
2,weak fragile model,"I liked this very much but it went out of order after two years---LCD Display lines. Some say that I am lucky to be able to use it a little more than two years. I want to buy it one more time but I am afraid to do so due to concern over its durability. I wish other electronic companies produced a model with oxford flatform asap. I recommend you not to buy it--for now, i just rely on online dictionary."
1,Buyers Beware: Dead after a year of use,Until today I would have given this product 5 stars in every area. However the product completely stopped working today. I tried the reset button which I had to do often. Today it did not work. I checked the batteries--no luck.I remember when I purchased this electronic dictionary. I read the review. I almost did not buy it because another customer had it die in a year. I wish I would have listened.JAC
4,"very good, but not perfect","Love the convenience of not having to lug my big unabridged dictionary out. Doesn't have as many words, though."
1,quits after a year,"Like other reviews for this product, so sad that a functional unit that my children got used to decided to quit after 14 months. New battery did nothing, re-set nothing. I researched all of these other posts and realize I'm a victim of the death of the product after a year like others. Going to look for another brand."
1,Good while it lasts.,"I gave this item a glowing review when I got it in July 2010. In fact I bought a second one.Well one year later, 21 days after the warrantee ran out, I get a series of about fifteen vertical lines which renders the screen useless. Now I'm just waiting for the other one to fail."
3,would be better if it can pronounce,"Basically the dictionary function is good, but as a electronic product, I would really hope that it will have an optional function that can pronounce the word I am interested."
1,The LCD screen does not last long,"I bought the first unit and really liked it. However a little after two years, the LCD screen quit. I thought, because of so many good reviews about this product, maybe I am unlucky to have a defective one. So, I bought another one from amazon.com, the same thing happened again: little over two years, the LCD screen quit again. Come on! Sharp, you can do a better job to let the LCD screen last a little longer!!!"
3,Sharp PW-E550,"The product is fine I bought the wrong product. I thought it was a version of the PW-E500 which as many more functions including Quotes, Solve,and is English not US english.I ordered this item because we in England can no longer purchase the PW-E500"
3,Sharp PW-E550 - Screen Fails after time,"When it works, it is terrific. When it fails, it is very disappointing. I bought it and I bought three others as gifts. After 1+ years, the screens have failed on at least two of them. It seems to be a common problem. Five stars for when it works, 1 star for when it fails - average 3 stars."
2,Good but there is a better option,"Although this dictionary is quite good, it's simply too inconvenient to use and too expensive to own.A better option is a dictionary toolbar, which can currently be downloaded free.[...]The toolbar provides instant lookup of an English word without opening a dictionary or going to a dictionary website. It shows word definiton in a popup box when the word is entered into a textbox or when a word on a web page is clicked and hightlighted. What a convenience!"
4,"Good, so far",Good purchase. A lot of definitions with word origins. We'll see what happens after the one year mark. Hopefully it retains screen integrity.
3,easy,"A pocket sized device w/letters large enough for anyone to read. This is an ideal gift for someone who writes w/o using a computer, poeple who love crosswords, or kids beginning to read at the level where they encounter a lot of new words."
3,LCD display became unusable after 2 years,"I bought this dictionary in March 2009. After two years blank lines started to appear on the LCD display. By now the dictionary has become unusable. Even though I miss it, I am not sure whether to buy the same dictionary again."
3,Good while it lasted,"After reading a lot of reviews, I bought one of these at an electronics store (Fry's, $88.00). Very pleased with it for a year and a half. Then the screen quit. The warranty is one year. I sent it to Sharp asking what they could do. No great expectations, just wondering what they would do, if anything, as I liked the thing but had expected a bit more longevity. No reply or comment from Sharp (in Illinois), but they sent it to a repair shop (Romax) in Texas who sent me a notice that it would be $159.50 to fix it (money up front), or if I wanted it back (as is), I needed to send them $10.00 shipping and handling. So... I can spend $10.00 on top of the purchase price and have nothing, or let them keep it, which I imagine will result in them refurbishing it and selling again. No joy anywhere. I've moved on to the Britannica ER 8000 by Seiko, but this has made me Sharp shy."
1,Good for ONE year only!,"Display of this Sharp PW-E550 after 1 year started having blank vertical lines and now is unreadable. Sharp is selling it for many years and did nothing to improve it - the same problem is described in many other reviews (I recommend reading them).So, my take is, that Sharp knowingly is selling the product that lasts only few weeks longer than its warranty.My advice to prospect buyers is: AVOID this product, otherwise it will cost you 20 cents a day to use it ($70 for 1 year use) and then you need to buy another one to the same effect.I think Sharp should recall all sold PW-E550 and replace the displays with fixed ones."
1,Stay away,"I received this item as a gift in December. Now in August the display is beginning to deteriorate. My Dad and Uncle also each have one and are having the same problem. I contacted sharp, and they only have a one year warranty. While mine will be under warranty my Dad's and Uncle's will not, as they have had it for over one year. (One and a half years). It seems something costing this much should last a LOT longer. I have 20 year old calculators that still work.While this has a wealth of info, I would never buy again because of the screen. That and sharp does not stand behind their product. I am very disappointed!!"
4,Handy Unit,I didn't give 5 on battery life because I haven't had it long enough to give a fair rating.I read a lot and find this unit handy to have nearby. So far I think it is worth the moneyand have no negative comments. It appears to be well constructed and is easy to use.
4,It has fewer words than the British Version,"It has fewer words than the British Version Sharp-E500, 250,000 to 355,000 words. It seems that the Americans need fewer words than the British do. Unlike the American version, the British version does not give pronunciation to all words. There is no pronunciation for the word ""revel"". I like the British version for covering more words but hate it for cannot pronounce the word ""revel"". Therefore, I have to carry two Sharp electronic dictionaries Sharp-E550 (U.S. version) and Sharp-E500 (U.K. version). Do you think it is fair to force me to carry two dictionaries?"
1,broken item,"the sharp used electronic word dictionary was not working when arrived, i was to be given credit back to the credit card used.Sharp Electronics PW-E550 Electronic Dictionary"
1,Screen does not last... starts showing blank lines,"Bought this product even after being warned by other reviewers, but thought I would take a chance. I saw the first blank line vertically after about 6 months, then 2 blank lines a month after that. Now 9 months later, it is completely unusable. Too many blank vertical lines make reading anything on the screen impossible."
4,No OED,"I was motivated to purchase an electronic dictionary due to reading the science fiction writer Jack Vance. Although I majored in English and attended law school(years ago) I was overwhelmed by his vocabulary; every several pages had a word I could not define. However, this device could not define the following(and other) words:roqual; metathasm; corolopsis; gleft; in one sentance there are several words "" ...peopled by gids, erbs, and deodands, as well as leucomorphs, ghouls and grues""; also: caccination; the list goes on. While Vance clearly strives to test our mettle I had hoped this little device would have every word--and my expectations may have been unrealistic. There are limits I guess. And again, if you are into being challenged check out Vance."
3,electronic dictionary,I bought this electronic dictionary only because the previously purchased excellent Seiko Encyclopaedia Britannica Oxford University electronic dictionary was not available. It does what it is required to do but not the excellent way the other one does.
5,Very good for Everyday-Vocabulary Learner,"For GMAT Prep, it is best to have a dictionary by your side. Yet, you find yourself too lazy to use hard version of Oxford, buy this product! Likewise, if you are too easy to be distracted by online dictionaries, buy this product!"
3,Making Money Off The Backs Of Those In Denial,"""Alcoholism is a behavior not a diesase."" This from someone who obviously does not have the disease. Interesting how this opinion is in direct contradition to the DSM IV, the American Medical Association and the American Phsychiatric Associate, interesting the lengths that these Alcoholics who do not suffer from the DISEASE of alcoholism must go to monitor and control their intake of alcohol. If they don't have the disease, why the insistance of the use of the substance they are not addicted to. I have the disease, some people don't. Get real.Al Ferber"
5,"Totally memorable, sweet movie","Hearing the sad news that Art Carney passed away today, it immediately made me think of Harry and Tonto - even before any of his other excellent work. This is a movie (yes, it has comedic moments but is not a 'comedy') that provokes thought, evokes an era, and sticks with you even many years later. I urge anyone with a heart (and a few hankies) to see this. The reviewer who mentioned the R rating had it exactly right - a reasonable mature youngster sees and hears far more on television than what appears in this movie! Let's hope it appears on DVD before too long - I'm in line for a copy."
2,"Art Carney is great, the writing not so much.","No question, Art Carney is a great actor.Unfortunately, after a good long journey through the movie, the ending sabotages the whole thing with a forced, copout ending worthy of no more than a C- in a freshman creative writing course. Yeah, I get it, Harry completely sheds his past and moves into the future. Could you use something less than a 20-pound sledgehammer to drive the point home? Tellingly, Carney's performance in the unnecessary goodbye scene is the only time he's unconvincing in the whole movie.Yeah, I know, ""bittersweet"" endings get you noticed by the Oscars. Sweet endings don't. But nobody seems to notice that bittersweet endings are the easy out.I wish I had passed on this one."
4,Very touching and sometimes difficult film to watch...,"Art Carney renders an amazing performance as Harry Coombs, a 70 year old schoolteacher who is forced along with his 11-year-old cat Tonto from his lifetime home when developers want to plough under his apartment building to make way for a parking garage. When he realizes that living with his son in the suburbs isn't working, Harry and Tonto opt to take to the road and see the world that a career and family kept Harry from doing so long ago. The one aspect of this film that shone through is that Harry never forgot his friends. He never abandoned Tonto, though if he had he'd have had more options on living space. This is definitely a touching 'coming of age' film."
4,A Blast from the Past,"I also remember seeing this movie when I was a young teen in the 70's. It's a nice period piece from that era. Definitely a type of movie that NEVER gets made anymore, at least in Hollywood. On seeing it on DVD, close to 30 years later, it does seem dated, but, so what. Its a very nice piece of film making. BTW, is it just my imagination, but did they dub the word ""bitch"" in place of the c-word ""c - - t"", in the DVD version?? Just curious."
3,ok,"Hello,i received the video, thank you everything was perfect, clean and fast.best regards from France !Pierre Clamaron"
3,I tried but didnt work for me,I tried IntraCleanse and was hoping for great results. It might have just been that the product didn't work for me. but it cause really bad stomack pains.I would definately recommend reviewing all the ingredients before purchasing.
2,The Weakest of the Four Seasons Albums,"I love John McCutcheon's music, and his previous three ""Four Seasons"" albums are outstanding. This one, however, lacks the creativity and great tunes of the others. Some of the songs sound like re-treads of others, and some just don't warrant a second listening. Overall, an unispiring effort from one of my favorite musicians."
5,Vintage Mouth,"This is how they sounded when they started, and it is the same as they are today!! A must for your collections"
5,Another Great Tale From A Great Storyteller,"Henry Buchanan, who calls himself a teller of tales, has outdone himself with this one. As in several of his other books he sketches the life and adventures of a flawed messiah. This one is John Calvin (hence Jay Cee) Brisbane. His mother had prayed for him to receive ""the Call"" and become a great preacher, but instead he was ""called"" to become President of the United States. And in fact he does. He is not a likely president, more of a dreamer than a politician, but his brother who is politically astute and his father-in-law, a famous senator, guide him to fulfill his destiny. This is an improbable tale but tremendously entertaining and well written, easy to read, and with some poignant insights into our political system. I recommend it highly."
1,May be a good item if Amazon could get it to you,"Ordered the mirrors in mid July for my daughter's birthday on July 29. They shipped in time to be here by then. The shipper (DHL) said they couldn't deliver. They shipped them back to shipper. Called Amazon. They shipped them again. Same thing. Got to post office. DHL shipped them back to sender. May be nice lamps, but I'll never know."
5,Love It! Wall mounting mirror on Amazon.com,"It was easy to put up and very sturdy. It's a plus especially for those who must wear glasses, I can see what I need to see. At first I thought I would need a lighted mirror, but I positioned it by my mirror and the lighting is great. I greatly recommend this mirror."
4,jerdon jp7507NB,Wish mirror was a little larger. other than that very nice. good quality and fair price. will probably purchase one for a gift.
4,Great Looking mirror with a good price,This was a gift for my mom. She likes to see the back of her hair and this works great. She said that she didn't realize how much she would enjoy the magnification for putting on her eye make-up etc... I like the look of it. It has a little extra detail that makes it look classy and decorative and the nickel finish matches her bathroom perfectly. I am pleased with the quality and feel that it was an extremely good buy.
2,Dangerous...,"This product is very poorly designed. When I tried to pivot the mirror at the center hinge, it snapped and a metal piece flew into the air nearly breaking my toilet.It looks like adjustment bolt at the center hinge was ""frozen"" and simply get broke when I pivoted mirror around it. The spring inside of hinge ""catapulted"" it with significant energy. This is very dangerous design.Considering overall good reviews, I decided to give product the second chance, but be careful this time and make sure that all adjustment bolt are ""movable"" before trying to pivot mirror.The replacement worked fine, but had missing screws. Ok. I took them from the first mirror.The last problem I experienced is vertical adjustment during installation. The base has both, round and oval holes for screws, but both oval holes are vertical, so you have very limited ability to adjust base to make it vertical."
3,"Basic, But Not First Class","I recently bought two wall mirrors, this swing-out unit, and a more expensive scissors-arm unit. The more expensive (about $110) unit is sturdy, hefty, and appears to be solid cast brass. This unit is lightweight, with thin, hollow tubes and a hollow stamped base. It doesn't look cheap, but it doesn't look or feel like a high-end item either. This is good for a guest or kids bathroom, but if you're upgrading your master bath, you really should look at a more expensive, solidly-built mirror.As a side note, when installing a wall mirror, you should either screw it straight into a stud, or buy some serious wall anchors. By design, you're going to be moving and pulling on this thing a lot, and you need to have a good, firm attachment to the wall. Always throw away the little plastic anchors that ship with any product like this, they are useless and are guaranteed to fail, sooner if not later."
4,great mirror for the price,This mirror is a great mirror for the price. It is a bit on the light weight side but works well and looks very nice. I guess you could get a more substantial mirror but you would have to pay at least double the price.
4,nice mirror,Super Saver shipping = SUPER SLOW! If you want them to ship out of the warehouse within a few days you will need to pay!
4,7xto1x wall mount telescoping mirror,"This mirror has met all my expectations. Easy to mount excellent reflective properties. The magnifying part serves its purpose well, especially for my wife's poor eyesight. Reasonably priced. Big bang for the buck."
4,we like it!,Good sturdy and good looking/quality product. We just hoped the shipping package was a bit more sturdy to keep it from breaking in transit (not that our was damaged)good product!
3,NICE ITEM,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON AND RETURNED IT, THE LIGHT UP VERSION IS ALOT MORE HELPFUL......."
5,Very nice!,"Good price and good product, what else do you want from a product?It's cute and very sturdy."
3,"Looks nice, just ignore the rattling","I would be extremely pleased with this product except that is has an ineffective mounting system. Two problems: (1) The mounting plate is slightly curved, and (2) the attached mounting screws are slightly too long. This means I cannot tighten the nut down enough so that the base is flush to the wall, and the base of the mirror will rattle loosely whenever the mirror is moved. This is either a production or design defect, but for this price, I expected something more sturdy."
3,Mostly O.K. for the price,"This mirror looks reasonably good, and was easy to mount.The non-magnifying side of my mirror had a slight defect toward an edge. Due to the small size of the defect and the fact this mirror was bought primarily for the magnifying side, this problem has been viewed as minor.The magnifying side has subtle ripples. This can be noticed when moving one's face very slowly up and down, or side to side. The face will barely distort like a mirror would do in a fun-house. To be fair for the price, this mirror should not be considered a fine optical device. The distortion is not distracting, and one can still use the mirror for close work as intended.I think this mirror is just fine for an average user. But serious critics may be more satisfied with a more expensive mirror."
5,Love this Mirror,I purchased this Jerdon wall mount mirror about a month ago and I love it. The 7x magnification can be a bit much at first but you adjust to it and then you wonder how you managed without it. Initially I thought I needed a lighted mirror but this is mounted next to my regular bathroom mirror with a good light fixture over it so having enough light is not an issue. The construction is very good and it was quite easy to put up.
5,Love this mirror,"I love this mirror!! I looked at mirrors like this at Bed,Bath&BEyond and they were like $40 or more. Now I can actually see to pluck my eyebrows..LOL. Great mirror for putting on eye makeup too. Love it!!"
4,I can see clearly now...,The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because it is only a 7x mirror. If it were 10x I would give it 5 stars. This mirror is wonderful! I can now see while putting on my eye makeup and when tweezing my brows. It folds back and out of the way neatly against the wall. Good purchase for the price!
4,just what I needed,I needed a mirror that I could really see close up and this is it. Very clear almost shows too much if you know what I mean but that is what I needed. I wish the arm was longer but it does what I needed. Very nice quality. Great Price.
5,Great Mirror!,I purchased this mirror for my bathroom. It was easy to install and only took me a few minutes. It is a very pretty mirror. It is great for inserting contact lenses or putting on makeup or plucking your eyebrows. I can't think of anything negative to say about this mirror. I love it.
4,longer option needed,"Nothing wrong with this mirror, except that it doesn't reach far enough for me to use as I'd like. I should have measured how far it would have to reach to be perfect for my needs."
5,lookin good,"We are extremely happy with our 7X mirror..It was easy to mount ,however the plastic expanding screw shields were not tappered. They were straight and when put in the wall they go straight through to the inside of the sheetrock...I replaced them with tappered shields so they would expand when you put the screw into it.."
5,GREAT MIRROR,What a great product. It looks very nice in our new bathroom. We use it every day. Highly recommend it.
2,Not what I expected,"I was excited to find this product because it was exactly what I had been looking for. My husband installed it for me, and when I tried to extend the arm, the whole bracket moved because the mounting bracket bolts are too long for the nut to securely anchor the product. OK, so nothing a few washer can't fix, although it is a hassle to have to take it off again and search for suitable washers to fix an engineering problem with the product. So, that fixed I try again. First to take off the factory stickers and clean the mirror. Well, under one of the stickers is a LARGE, DEEP scratch in the mirror. Too frustrated now to take the thing down to ship back, I will leave it up but am very dissatisfied with the purchase. I only gave it two stars because it IS what I wanted. Just not the quality I expected."
1,Negative Novel For Young Adults,"The lead character, Kara Hendricks, in this novel is extremely negative, insecure & suffers from low self-esteem through much of this novel. She calls herself lame, stupid, loser and worse over and over again that it gets old very quickly.Kara Hendricks is depressed over losing her best friend to the popular in crowd & suffers from depression & low self esteem for this reason. Kara doesn't make an effort to try talking about her suffering to those who reach out to her or attempt to move on with her life.Suddenly, Kara Hendricks reads a book about the Christian faith and attends a youth group where she finds herself magically transformed into a happier person due to accepting Jesus in what seems to be a rather sudden leap of faith.I am not saying that people aren't transformed spiritually by which ever faith they subscribe to & become better and happier people because of this experience... I am just saying that I thought the author's way of expressing things was hokey."
3,2Bor not2B,"Kara is struggling with fer best friend forever jordan fugerson and is having a tuff time letting her go. This book is really cool. I understand now why they called it dark blue. soooo don't be ashamed, read dark blue."
3,Who are your True Friends,I read the book Dark Blue from the True Colors Series. I didn't like this book as well as the other eight. This book is about a girl named Kara and she loses her best friend Jordan. When she finds a new group of friends she becomes very caring of them. Kara also finds a new best friend that she turns to a lot of things. You will have to read to figure out who that person is. Something in the book happens to Jordan and her new group of friends and now Kara is the only one she can turn to. Will Kara be friends with her again after that horrible thing that she has done to her. This is the first book that she wrote out of the series and there are a total of eight books. There is a new on coming out in July. I can't wait for this book !
2,I wish life were this easy!,"The main character is depressed, then suddenly finds God and everything is okay. Yes, I believe in God's healing, but I don't think it is really like a lightening bolt. This book only contributes to the Christian belief that you should be able to pray and ""trust"" God and just snap out of depression. You'd never say that to someone with cancer or an amputated limb, why depression?"
4,*High School Horror*,"Dark Blue is about two girls, Kara and Jordan, and they have been friends since kindergarten. When they get in high school Jordan decides she wants to try out for cheerleading and she didn't make it. The next year she tries out again, but unlike last year, she makes it. A couple weeks after she makes it she starts going on and on about it and kind of leaves Kara out of things and starts hanging out with the popular cheerleaders. Kara gets sad and goes home every night and just cries. If you want to find out if they become friends again read the Color Series by Melody Carlson.I made a text-to-self connection in Dark Blue. At the beginning of the year one of my old friends and I were best friends and now we never hang out or talk. I really thought we would be best friends forever, but like they all say, ""nothing lasts forever"". It makes me think about how bad Kara felt when Jordan ditched her for all the more popular girls. That was the biggest connection I made in Dark Blue."
1,did not like it,I didnnot like it because it was so depressing and did not even read it all.maybe it is just me
5,Excellent informative VHS,"For the new Mother to be who needs to know how to control breathing and give birth naturally this is an excellent item for you. Very informative, step by step instructions. Very helpful. Highly recommend."
5,Only thing better is hearing her sing live!,"I was at a big, crowded, NOISEY party, a publication launch for a magazine in San Diego. I was intently trying to engage a most beautiful green-eyed girl in conversation. I had my back turned, but I could hear, somewhere in all the noise of lively conversation, a soft-spoken woman introducing herself and a pianist. In the next moment something wonderful happened. I heard this woman start singing, and her voice filled the room! Everyone went quiet, every conversation instantly stopped, and everyone turned to face the woman by the piano. She had a big voice, loaded with character. And she was singing without a microphone. The only words I heard, other than the song, were some partyers whispering excitedly, ""Wow!"" and ""Man, what a voice!""That was the first time I heard Lisa Kessler sing."
5,A New Life Rates High,Lisa Kessler has a beautiful rich voice and should be on the stage. She brought shivers to me. I love the CD and hope she continues to produce CDs.
2,Boring......,Stick with the 2002 and 2003 CD's. This one lacks the kick of the others and the chosen songs don't flow well.
1,So-so snapshots,"This compilation of snapshots, many from backstage in the fashion world, tries very hard, but misses by a mile. The pictures are OK, mostly, but no more, and the design is just too precious -- ring-bound, in a looseleaf-notebook-style cover (Oh, HOW clever!), and much of the minimal text (one full page) is set black-on-dark grey, so you can't read it. There are pithy comments from famous folks juxtaposed with some of the pix, but they don't amount to much. If you want a book like this, try Arthur Elgort's Models Manual -- it's 1000% better. I was given this book as a gift -- otherwise I would have sent it back."
5,Perfect,"What a great book! Makes the perfect gift, but be sure to buy two because you are going to want to keep it for yourself!"
1,Huge disappointment,"I purchased this cashmere robe for my husband for his birthday, but the XL men's size robe that arrived was woefully too small. It would maybe fit an x=large napolese man, but certainly not an American. To make it worse not only was my husband disappointed, but I had to hassle with shlepping to the post office to return it only to now have to argue with ""the boutique"" to have my money credited to my card. ""They are generously offering me a store credit"" (yeah, right). so...now they have their merchandise AND my money! BEWARE, DON'T BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE."
3,"Should be listed under ""Religious Fiction""","Great photos and a pretty good feel of what it might be like to hike the trail from end-to-end, although getting picked up to go home for a week for somebody's wedding kind of blows the non-stop trek claim. My main problem was the author's constant sniveling to god. Any book about a thru-hiker is as much (or more) about the hiker as it is about the trail and their daily trials and tribulations. I had hoped to cheer the person who could accomplish this feat as a man (or woman) who stood and walked tall with pride at their success. Wadness rarely gets off his knees, and giving all the credit to his god would make his part in such a trek meaningless. God could even get a blind man with no legs through the trail, so it's no big deal, right? Christians will have no problem with this. Atheists may feel more pity than pride for him."
3,"Good Performance, but lack of drivers.","The 7900 GS with 256MB of fast RAM is a good performer (""great"" on Windows XP), however, it is unforgiveable that nVidia still doesn't have an SLI driver to allow two of these cards to run in tandem in VISTA. They certainly have had ample time to have drivers ready. Maybe they just want you to spend twice the amount of money, and buy their 8800 Series cards."
4,The best US$/quality,"Nice buy. I'm really satisfied. World of Warcraft at maximum resolution (1680x1050) and max quality and NO PROBLEM. It was my goal, I achieved this I'm satisfied. My machine: Core 2 Duo E6400, Asus P5N-E, 2Gb RAM (Corsair XMS2 800 MHz) and this videoboard. I didn't use DVI."
3,Women's Spirituality,"The author provides an examination of the various spiritual dimensions present in women's literature through writers such as Adrienne Rich, Ntozake Shange, and Margaret Atwood, etc. She creates a new paradigm in which women may find ""spiritual renewal through new self-definition""(anything from a new phase of a woman's life or a new way she chooses to live her life). This book approaches and attempts to answer questions most of us have asked ourselves."
4,very good experience,good product good price good service so thats how its shud be to get wat u want and not to be screwed over so i wud recomend to a friend
1,Not compatible with my external Monitor and bad Technical support,"The basics work fine; keyboard, mouse, speakersBut I have not been able to get the dock to support my monitor. I installed the new drivers from the Kensington web site which seem to work termporarily. However, upon reboot my Dell XPS laptop (running Vista) does not recognize the VGA driver.I called Kensington for support on this issue. I got the worse support I have received in my life. Support did nothing to diagnos the problem. They claimed it was a Microsoft or Dell issue and that I should call them."
3,Kensington Dock review by Andre,The dock is pretty good also it has problems with relaying thevideo stream to the external monitor. Especially at boot time it does not show the right screen layout. Sometimes it has some real strange mouse movements shown on the screen. The sound to the external speakers does not work properly as well. This is certainly a driver problem.
3,Great but it didn't last,"This docking station worked great for me. Easy to install and easy to use. My only real complaint is it's less than 2 years old and 2 of my ports have gone bad. One of the USB ports and the VGA Port. I was only using 4 of the USB Ports so I could move my printer and continue to use it. However, now I can't use my external monitor without plugging it directly in to the back of my laptop. Plugging and unplugging constantly is bad for the pins. My recommendation: pay a little more and get one that has a longer warranty."
2,Usless with New VISTA Computers,"I spent several hours attempting to get the video form my new Toshiba Laptop- new HP display along with the normal geek stuff- i.e. PDA phone, HP printer, Scanner, sound system - mouse and key board. In the end tossed the Expansion Dock in the heap of older out dated computer stuff- in the end used a powered seven USB hub and ended up with (4)plugs to laptop- 1. Power, 2. Video 3. Sound cable to HP display and 4. The USB Hub.I feel the conflicts are a result of the Expansion Dock attempting to work with the new VISTA operating System. Just a paint to get the things to play together upon shut down to re- boot.In the end a Toshiba laptop owner might have to wait for Toshiba to get its Tower Port System a little better engineered- from most reviews it has a way to go- I have not tried it - wasted far too much on hardware and some degree software that does not work as stated."
1,does NOT work with Lenovo ThinkPad,"terrible. not very compatible with a new lenovo thinkpad. sound constantly cuts out, video freezes (windows media player, netflix instant, etc.), and itunes and other music programs constantly crash as well. a waste of 100 bucks."
1,"I'd rate a ""0"" if I could","If there was more detail from Amazon, I would have never bought this item. To me, the whole point of buying a docking station is so I don't have to lug around the power pack in and out of my laptop case. This docking station didn't come with a power pack!!! A USB port hub will almost be as good as this docking station - with the exception of a place to hook the monitor. I tried to go generic - but at the end of the day, but a docking station that is made for your specific laptop by your laptop manufacturer. You will be much happier in the long run."
3,"Video plug-in is weak, otherwise OK","Overall, a nice and compact product.My only complaint is this: I have a widescreen monitor and the video input doesn't recognize a monitor. Therefore, I don't have the option to change the graphic settings so that everything isn't really stretched on the monitor screen -- unless I plug the monitor cable directly into my laptop.Be warned, fellow widescreen-monitor-owners!"
3,Video connection not what I wanted,"The USB connectors on this expansion dock worked just fine. But the video connector only allowed the same resolution and form factor for an external monitor as the laptop screen. If your external monitor has the same resolution and form factor as your laptop screen, it should work fine. My external monitor had a different form factor and so the image on the external monitor didn't fill the whole monitor screen. Be sure to get updated drivers from the Kensington web site."
1,Customer Service Nightmare,"Product came DOA - software wouldn't load. Called technical support who 3 times said they would email the download, but their English wasn't good enough to get my email address correct - even after spelling several times.Called Kensington Corporate in California and spoke to Customer Service Manager who said someone would call me shortly. Called Customer Service Manager back 24 hours later and he noted it wasn't his fault no one contacted me, as he passed on the information.I'm returning this after investing hours unsuccessfully trying to overcome the Kensington Customer Service Prevention Department."
5,Great for trigger point therapy,"The AccuMassage is a great way to easily put pressure on tight neck muscles to get them to release. The Body Back Buddy has more knobs & a great tip on one end that is angled in to better put pressure and pull on tight large muscles along the spine so it has more functions than the Theracane which I had been using for years. The hook ends are a little small for a big guy like me (6', 220 lbs.) but I can still get to the tight spots, but I wouldn't buy one if you are any bigger than I am. My wife likes this one a lot better than the Theracane. The Body Back Buddy seems to be available at a lower price than the Theracane."
4,Good,Still use the Squeeze device. And yeah it helps. Only way it could be better is it have a little longer handles with light bend to them.
2,lousy service and shipping,"I won't comment on the quality of the items but the service is sloooow. i ordered 3 sets which they charged $20 for shipping alone. Estimated delivery was 3-5 days. already 6 business days have passed and still nothing in sight. I had ordered them on the basis that they will fulfill the order on time so I can take them overseas w/ me, but now I guess I won't be able to take them w/ me. what lousy service. On a different order previously for the body back buddy, they were supposed to include manual and the order came w/ no manual. They tried to play it off as if the customer is ignorant by not mentioning anything. Contacted them and they offered to give back a few dollars for the missing manual. Just bear in mind extra delays when ordering this, and the extra shipping costs even if you have amazon prime."
4,Nice Set,"This def helps more than I thought it would! After doing some research on how the trigger points work, it really did make a big difference."
5,Great duo,I got these a few weeks ago and they work great. The Accumassage is great for the neck and shoulder area. The Back Buddy can get any sore spot on your body. I highly recommend these.
1,sticker glue won't come off,"Scoop is OK, especially for the price. But the sticker won't come off without scrubbing, then more scrubbing, and then the scoop still has sticky glue left on it. I rated this scoop one star because of the sticker glue."
4,Great for the most part,I wanted something that would make filling the thistle feeder less messy. This works very well. The only problem is the sliding gate at the top of the neck is hard to open and close and is very flimsy . I fear it will break unless I am very careful with it.
1,A fumble,"This book has too many problems to be inducted into the Ring of Honor. Here are just a few. First, this book has unacceptable factual errors(see A. Keller's review). Second the author believes the season opener will make or break the season. The 1993 Dallas Cowboys(one of the top three teams of all time) lost their first two games of the season. Equally as great, the 1981 San Francisco 49ers lost their opener. The author must believe that Jerry Jones died at the Alamo. I don't see what he had to gain by criticizing Randy Galloway's(a frequent Jones critic) choice in the 1972 presidential election. Horrible foul."
4,"Wonderful, if you have a wide door","I'm lucky to have a wide closet door to hang this on, so it works perfectly for me. I can see the other reviewer's point of view - I'm sure it would get a bit crumpled if you were rolling it up and stowing it somewhere. But for those of you with a big closet door (be sure to measure before purchase!!) this is great -- no wrinkles ever. It holds so much tissue, ribbon, bows, tape, and scissors, I am now totally organized. My only gripes are that I wish it held at least one or two more rolls of wrappping paper. Also, the ribbon bar isn't really strong, so if you load it up, the bar will bend and then dips over the tissue paper row. So it's a bit of a pain to get the tissue paper in and out, but not a major issue. Just the fact that I have multiple pockets to store my tissue by colors make me so happy!"
2,Careful - NOT a space saver!,"While this is a nice organizational product it is NOT a spacesaver. I bought this hoping to be able to hang it in my closet. It is actually wider than a standard closet space and is not designed to be hung on a closet bar. It is designed to be hung either on a rack of some sort, the back of a door (perhaps) or a hook on a wall. None of those solutions are good if you live in a small space. I can see how this might be a good way to organize a few wrapping supplies, but as far as an efficient storage solution, this really doesn't cut it. It's not worth spending the postage to send back so now I'm stuck with a worthtless product that I have no way of utilizing."
1,Crumbles your wrapping paper,"Purchased this to help me organize my wrapping paper. It only holds a few rolls and the small ones only. When you roll it up to close it, the wrapping paper gets damaged. I think the hard case ones would be better and fit bigger rolls. Anything in this soft mesh type bag would get damaged if it's not place somewhere carefully."
2,not a must have,"it doesn't fit all of my wrapping paper sizes. it is nice to store some things like ribbons and tags, but not a must have."
5,Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Croatian Dictionary,"Hippocrene Children's Illustrated Croatian Dictionary is well made, has pretty pictures and only 2-3 little mistakes in translation. It is a perfect book for a child (of any age) learning Croatian. Thank you for the prompt delivery."
3,Prepare for frustration,"As part of my job, I am often trying to quickly look up mammalian taxonomy. Once I find the mammal, the information is good - however, getting there can be a battle. The index drives me CRAZY. For example, take peek at the sample pages. Look up 'bat' in the index. Note that it's not there. You have to know the EXACT common or scientific name to find an animal. Or else just browse through the appropriate chapter. The time I've spent just trying to find a particular species knocks this down to three stars, and that's being generous"
5,Great telling of old tale,"Really a very pleasant surprize, engaging and colorfully written. Reminded me of books some of my all time favorites such as To Reign in Hell by Steven Brust or Lord of Light by Rodger Zelzany.The ladies have hit a home run their first time at bat, hopefully we can look forward to much more in the future."
5,Great read!,"I didn't expect this book to be that interesting, for who would care about Oedipus's passive wife, best known for wanting to avoid the truth and hanging herself? But Iokaste (not Jocasta!) is a really good read, snaring me with the first words of the prologue. Grossack and Underwood take a bit character and give her a voice, and I was impressed with the variety and the arcs of the other characters: Kreon, Laius, the different forms of the Tiresias, Niobe, Menoeceus and Antigone. I had a little trouble relating to Oedipus and the Sphinx; on the other hand, the riddle contest with Oedipus and the Sphinx was compelling, so maybe my judgment is somehow skewed. I can't hope for the continuing adventures of Iokaste - the poor woman is dead! - but I hope the authors will bring us back to Thebes."
3,An original take on an ancient tale,"The description ""page-turner"" is aptly used by previous reviewers, and I'll echo it. Indeed, I found this telling of a classic story from a new perspective hard to put down, even though the ending toward which it was moving was inevitable and known. The historical background is solidly researched, and the narrative style lively. Letting us glimpse Antigone as a frustratingly difficult adolescent was a clever stroke. (We know too well where that stubborn child is heading!) A number of other secondary characters were vividly sketched, yet I must add that they engaged my imagination and sympathy more than they apparently did the interest of the story's central character. Iokaste herself seems oddly self-centered and unreflective, and fails to mature emotionally during the course of years."
2,OLD product ... Buyer be ware,"I ordered 3 of these mousse shadows in rose, champagne, and lilac. Having previously purchased one 2-3 years ago, I knew what to expect -- a soft, shimmering creme that is natural and doesn't cake on the lid or settle into lines. Now that it has been discontinued, its been difficult to find ... so, I picked up several here.What a disappointment! The rose shadow was separating into solids and liquids. The lilac went on clumpy and rolled up onto little balls on my lid and cheek. The champagne was soft and glowing as it should be.Clearly, these are old products that are hardly worth anything. My advice - see if you can't find them at the dollar store. But bypass purchasing them here. I'm out $25 for product worth less than $5."
2,disapointing,"I like Joan Severance so I purchased this movie. I'm afraid Joan has outlived her hay day, if she ever had one. This movie was poorly written and the acting was not well done."
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could,Is this a joke? Unwatchable! Horrible...Worse than a B movie...there is no letter for how awful this was. I want a refund. Oh my lord.
4,Good movie,"Unlike most of the movies regarding affairs, this one is about a young guy and an older woman who is unfaithful to her husband. For a chance we see the opposite in the drama, where 80% of the movies that involve affair is from the guy's side.I think is a good movie, actin and quality are ok. I recommend it, no douth!*Sponsored post"
1,Time set switch failed in 4 weeks.,"Another example of a cheap electronic product that is really quite expensive. Perhaps the most important switch, that permitting the time to be set, or reset in the case of return to standard time, failed after the clock was in use for only 4 weeks. The problem could have been anywhere, but my guess is the crappy filament switches, that cannot be replaced, underneath the front-panel plastic buttons. My advice: spend your $13 elsewhere."
4,Great for the price,I bought this for my dad last minute for our Father's Day golf outing and it did the trick. I don't like the thin material it's made of but it's still sturdy enough for the occasional golfer.
3,It's pretty DAMN good,If you're into industrial music...then get this!If you're into NIN...then get this!This is nothing innovative but it's good for its genre.The covers of Bjork's army of me and STP's Creep aren't bad either.
3,Defective,"The watch band became disconnected within a week. I liked the overall style and construction. The Day portion of the display is printed in a dark red which makes it almost invisible most of the time. For some reason the watch arrived with a leather band instead of the titaneum one. Too bad, I really wanted to like this watch"
2,gore galore,"Evil corporation makes product with horrible side-effects . . . hardy band of survivors . . . government cover-up . . . yadda yadda yadda-- you know the script. New animal feed turns animals and humans into cannibalistic vampires, resulting in enough gore for a George Romero film. The word ""fusty"" used at least five times. Adequate time-killer."
5,Read this long ago.,"I read this book so long ago, and couldn't remember the title. I've searched a few times over the years, trying to figure out who wrote it, or where I could find it. But, a search on GoodReads led me here, and I had to purchase In the Keep of Time again.I haven't read it all yet, but Margaret J. Anderson is an amazing author, and this is a beautiful book that is fun to read."
4,enjoy this book on your own time,"four children are visiting their' great aunt and while exploring the ruins of an ancient castle,they fall back in time to 1460.the children take care of eachother and are concerned with getting back to their'own time(20th century). they do return eventually but,not before getting a taste of some adventure and learning to live with the locals in 1460. this story is wonderfully written. this is for adults as well as kids. i kept trying to figure out how it would end. a nice tale of time travel."
4,Nice Hammock,The hammock was pretty large and the pocket to store it was a good idea as well. The only complaint I would have to say I had was that there wasnt any rope to hang it with like what was stated in the description. There was about 4 inches or so of tie with an S shaped clip on the end. No rope. I ended up having to go to the local home depot and spend $10 on some rope to hang it.
4,a must in its genre...,"I bought all 3 of Frezzato's ""Les Gardiens du Maser"" (in french, but i read one of them in english, in Heavy Metal mag). I loved them all very much, Frezzato's art is stunning, such attention to details impress me very much. The characters are very enjoyable and have personas that compels you to have more and more to read about them. The fictional world they live in is very realistic technology-wise. The gizmos they carry, the vehicules, the robots, the evil dwarves are all so interesting... i can't wait for the rest of the books to come out."
4,Off to a thrilling start,"This book meets three of Heavy Metal's four traditional benchmarks: gorgeous art, exciting SF/fantasy adventure, and erratic plotting. If women had appeared scantily clad in more than two panels, it would have been an HM archetype.This appears to be the start of a long-lived adventure series. As such, it lays out the fantasy's ground rules and setting (a world of after-the-collapse technology), and introduces the Quest: a trek to the semi-mythical Maser. And, as an introductory chapter should, it leaves much to be revealed in the installments to come. That dangling vagueness can frustrate a reader who lacks access to later chapters, but it also piques interest in following along.It hooked me, at least. I won't spend rent money to collect the rest of this series, but I'll keep an eye out for it.-- wiredweird"
5,Gorgeous!,"Excellent book. The artwork is top notch. The characters are expressive and alive, and the rendering is incredible. The story is fun and entertaining. I'm definitely going to buy the rest."
2,A paperback version would have been better...,"While specific to the works of Batchelder, the photo supplements leave much to be desired - they are too general (a photo of a tiled room is nice, but a few more detail photos would have been most welcome!) and there are simply not enough of them (especially when compared to works referred in text). Overall, I found the book too big (and expensive) for the content delivered."
3,Batchelder Tilemaker,"Not the greatest tile reference, the detail in the photos is poor and hard to see. Most of the historical reference in this book is accurate, but poorly written. I would not purchase this book early in a library building journey, save it for when you have excess money to spend and are just trying to fill and round out your collection."
2,"Poorly written, fair photos","When the back cover of a book informs you that the author is reputable, rather than the subject is well written - take it as a warning.This sophomorically written book is not intended for Arts & Crafts devotes, it is meant for tour guides who wants to get an ""Ooo!"" or a giggle out of a bus load of little old ladies.While the photos are fair, I found myself wishing I could actually see what they were showing. I guess the little old ladies are use to not being allowed too close, but I'd like to zoom in, please.Throughout the book, the reader is assured that the author is highly praised by the Governor of California. Perhaps taxpayers should insist their Governor spend his time more selectively."
1,Pointless,Didn't aid in the progress of knowledge for this MSW student nor did it ascertain my current attributes for the field.
1,field instruction,"I sure this book is great, but unfortunately we didn't use the book in class. I brought it for nothing. :("
3,Good reading,"It's an easy book to read, and it asks questions that at times you might not necessarily ask yourself."
3,Most of the presidents men,"This book was a pretty good read, but i think that it was very informative, and did not have a lot of feeling added to the words. It was very informative, but it was not what you want to read if you are just looking for a novel to read. If you want information, read this book, if your looking for real-life drama, look elsewhere."
3,"A great book, but only if read in the 70's!","As a college student taking Political Science, I was required to read this book for a paper over the Watergate scandel. While this book was extremely informative, it was written for people who already knew the players in the watergate affair and their relationships in Washington. Some 80 names are thrown at you in the first 50 pages alone. In short, this was not a book with which to begin your knowledge of watergate."
2,"good resource, bad journalism","This book is a classic, not because of it's literary qualities but because it was first in the queue. Frankly, after re-reading it 25 years after watching the Watergate story unfold first-hand I wonder how my daughter, without the benefit of my prior knowledge, could ever really understand what happened back then and why it was important from this book. It clearly captures a lot of key facts, but does a lousy job of telling the story in a manner suited for the ages. A period piece at best."
2,Real world mystery made tedious,"So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a ""classic."""
2,"Who, What?","After watching the film of ""All the President's Men"" on cable several times and loving it every time I thought the book HAD to be better. The book is usually better than the movie, right? Boy was I disappointed. I was around during the Watergate era (in high school) and watched quite a bit of the hearings on T.V. But I found the book very hard to read. To me it was almost like reading the geneology sections in the Bible where so-and-so beget so-and-so, one name after another. Boring. Too many names thrown at me in too short a span. I kept expecting it to kick in and I'd be hooked. After maybe 20 pages of the book I said ""enough"" and watched the movie again."
3,very interesting,"This novel was a little hard to follow. Once you started to read it, it became more interesting."
3,Effective political warfare,"I once believed that every word of this book was true. Written by a fellow Wheatonite (Woodward) it pushed me solidly into voting democrat for the next 20 years.Now, the likelihood is that this book is almost as fictional as the John erhlickman book. For the story that is more likely to be the truth read Silent Coupe.For many, this book remains the bible for the anti-Nixon zeolots, who membership used to include me."
2,all the president's men,"I am an avid reader and as you know order quite a few. I am sorry to have to tell you I was very disappointed in this item. The cover was tattered & the pages were yellowed & dirty. I realize that this is a used copy & therefore a little used but RAGGEDy I don't think so!!Thank you for inquiring. Sincerely, E. Stewart"
5,Helpful and detailed,"I read/listened to All The Presidents Men, because I am a Journalism major in college. Therefore, I am partially biased. The book offers great detail into the world of Journalism and the problems/consquences a journalist goes through as they work a story. With dedication and determination Woodward and Bernstein are able to uncover the biggest story of the 20th century. For those reading the book for school my recommendation would be in fact to read it. As opposed to listening to it as I did. However for those reading for the fun of it. I thought the Audio version was captivating and well paced."
4,A very good book,"This book, written with the style of a newspaper reporter, is a great one, chronicaling the struggle to reveal the truth about the Nixon administration. The only flaw was that the authors seem to assume the reader already knows many of the minor characters from experiencing the Watergate scandal as a citizen. For this reason, this book can be challenging for young readers."
2,...,"With all the Clinton scandals that have gone on, and Clinton stayed in the White House, reading this book makes Nixon's transgressions seem positively quaint by comparison. This book had its effect in its day, but with the more recent publication of SILENT COUP that reveals that Alexander Haig was Deep Throat, and Woodward's disingenousness about the whole affair, and that John Dean was actually behind the break-in to get an address book of prostitutes' names that had his wife's name in it from the DNC, this book is like reading a pre-Columbus book about the earth being flat. It's out of date. Read it to see what affected the country, but not for its now unfactual facts. If you want to know about Watergate, read SILENT COUP: THE REMOVAL OF A PRESIDENT."
2,Hard to get going.....,"Well i had to read this book for a program at my school called Accelerated reader, in my gr 11 english class. I heard about this book, and choose it without actually seeing the book. When i went to sign it out of the library i was shocked! It was like a History Textbook!! Just one big news story that wouldn't end! Because i hadn't lived through the Watergate scandal time period, i was like, ""what on earth is going on!"" It's so confusing, millions of names are thrown at you all at once, in which you are supposed to remember, not only who they are, but their significance in the novel as well! AHHHHH!!! SO i finally gave up and watched the movie, and took notes. Well then when i went to write my Accelerated Reader test on the computer, guess who got failed! I wish i had read the book, because some of the questions weren't in the movie and were straight from the textbook..(hehe i mean novel!)"
2,All the presidents B.S.,"What the? What was he smoking when he thought up this little pipe-dream? It's so unrealistic. It's entertaining, if you like science-fiction. I just waited and waited for the story, but it never came. Read this one to your kids to put them asleep, or if you want to add some more imagination to their diluted little lives."
1,It sucks!,I thought that this book was the worst peace of literature to be put out on the book stands. it was a piece of crap!
1,"Bad then, Bad now.",I read the book and saw the movie. I was hoping that i would get something out of it but didn't. Government was corrupt then and it is now. Nothing has changed and with all the rehashing of this on TV who needs the book?
5,Still a Great Read,"Perhaps the most famous investigative book ever, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN holds up as a classic even with a re-reading thirty-five years later. The prose is excellent, the pacing is swift, the detailing is exacting."
4,A Great Bargain,I grew up loving my dad's cassette of this. The older I get the more brilliant it sounds.
4,Joan Mitchell (2009),"Buyers beware: the description provided by Amazon and the review above refer to a 1988 Hudson Hills publication of the same name. This book is totally different.This is a quality publication, with good essays (in both English and German)and supurb images. All 34 plates are full color, full page, all with crisp resolution, and span from 1950 to 1992. What the book lacks in number of images, it makes up for with some 'rarities' taken from private collections, previously unpublished. This is certainly not even close to a definitive collection of Mitchell's work, but it is a good overview."
4,"Works fine, looks good ... cloth bag is NOT a sleeve for the Zune","The Agent 18 cover is fine, it does what it is supposed to do although it would be nice to have a belt clip or similar.I have to say to alllll those people who assume that ""nice cloth sleeve"" is meant to hold your Zune ... think twice. That nice cloth bag is meant to hold your nice, chromed Zune earbuds. :)"
3,"Not a bad product, but is it necessary?","I just purchased a white Zune, along with it I bought this item thinking that I would surely need some sort of case. However, when I opened up the Zune, I found that it comes with a rather nice cloth sleeve. The cloth case is very snug and quite stylish, but if you have this Agent 18 Cover on your Zune (or any case for that matter) the Zune will not fit inside the cloth sleeve. Just a heads up, you might want to wait before ordering this... the sleeve/case included with the Zune may work out just fine... save the money."
4,An unexpected delight,"Few people remember that Carol Burnett got her start as a singer as much as a stand-up comedienne, but she was the original Winifred the Woebegone in ONCE UPON A MATTRESS and of course was the original choice to play Fanny Brice in FUNNY GIRL. She has a very big, very strident voice (it's the vocal equivalent of a trombone), and it's often used for terrific effect in very bright upbeat songs (""The Trolley Song"" has always been one of her best). She often overplays her hand a bit when she goes for pathos, as in ""Happiness is Just a thing Called Joe,"" but surprisingly she can be very effective in quieter numbers--the highlight of the CD might even be the catchy little ""Give a Little--Get a Little"" by Jule Styne."
5,Unexpected Gem!,"It's very fun and surprising to hear Carol sing these standards. She uses her voice like a great trumpet player: brass when you need, sweet when you want it!Her take on each song is great. Of course, she excels at the ""patter"" songs, the ""character"" song (such as ""I Can't Say No"" from OKLAHOMA) but she delighted me in ballads like ""Happiness Is Just A Thing Called Joe"" and ""Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry.""She should played Mama Rose in GYPSY! Check out her take on ""Everything's Coming Up Roses."" She was a ""belter"" before ""belting"" was cool and she should give these kids a real lesson on dynamics! Great arrangements too!"
5,great !!! all of his books are the best!,"i have, and have read all of his books..started late, in 1965, and love every one, from the first travis to the last....and all the others......cannot choose a favorite, cause all are # 10'"
1,Not for me!,Was hoping it would help with interstitial cystitis. After two days it caused a lot more pain instead. Will cut more foods out of my diet instead.
4,...,"I can see how useful if you need to secure a motorcycle. Or for those cities with a lot of bicycle theft and if you are willing to ride with 10 extra bulky pounds.I loved the chain, however. I had fun putting it around my 100 lb girlfriend's neck and taking pictures, but I had to return it. A mistake on my part for thinking it wasn't going to be THAT big."
1,"Chain too thick, lock doesn't close","The chain is too thick for the lock to close. So it is useless, you need a larger lock with this chain."
5,Beast Lives Up To It's Name,"All I can say is that I have peace of mind now that I have bought this lock. Just looking at it is a deterrent, and I can't imagine anybody trying to cut through this lock, being titanium fortified and having hexagonal 12mm links. I lock my bike in the apartment building parking lot because the apartment is too crowded and I don't worry about it anymore since someone tried to steal it. They couldn't cut through the ulock I was using. Now, I use a ulock through the frame to the Beast 5017 which is looped around a large fence pole. And I got cable going through the wheels to the ulock. The only thing vulnerable to cutters are the cables. The Beast lock looks and feels unbeatable and the price was reasonable-$66.00.OnGuard Beast 5017 Bicycle Chain Lock"
5,Beast,"THis really is a beast.Lock is very smooth,and you get plenty of keys to go with it. A super chain and lock, but you don't want to carry this around on the bike, I use this for home lock up and when out on the town I use a Arbus U lock with a 12mm cable."
5,Truly a beast.,"This lock/chain combo weighs a ton -- about 1/2 as much as my bike, maybe more -- and seems very solid. It comes with 5 keys, one of which has a built-in light. I leave this on the bike rack at work mostly, rather than carrying it back and forth. I don't live in a high-crime area, but this gives me peace of mind while I'm inside at work all day, without lugging a big lock around. I am glad that it has a nylon chain cover, because the massive links would destroy a bike's paint job in no time, otherwise. All in all, a very well made bike lock system."
3,Heavy but works,"The chain is quite a bit heavier than I was expecting. I also wish I'd paid attention to how it was locked when it arrived since I had trouble getting it to work because I tried to put the lock hasp between two links instead of passing a link through a link. If you want a very heavy chain, this is a good one. I went with the Master lock reviewed elsewhere too. It seems like a better lock and the keyhole cover is nice. If you're looking to lock a bicycle, this might be a bit heavier than you need unless it's a cargo bike (like mine) or in an urban area where you need all the security you can get."
5,Keyless Remote,The Keyless Remote works great. The programming instructions were right on. It only took a cople of min. to get it programed.
3,"Great on the theory, but terribly lacking in practice.","This book was defintely meant to be used in a classroom setting. The theory is very well explained, but when it comes down to practice, there are not enough exercises to practise what you learnt. Additionally, for the exercises offered, only some of the answers are provided at the back of the book. If you want to learn about finance on your own, this is not the book to buy. However, if you do buy the book, then make sure that you buy it as a compliment to another finance book filled with exercises; or beter yet, as a compliment to a finance class where your teacher (should) give you all the extra exercises you need."
4,Wonderful,This was one of the first books I bought for our family library. I found it very helpful. I love the traditional recipies and the music in it.I also enjoyed the rituals. They were great for our first year of celebrating and now we borrow a bit form them and add our own bits to make them ours. I think this is better to use with older children than with toddlers or preschoolers but a must have!
3,good supplemental resource,"This is a good book to have in supplement to ""Circle Round"" by Starhawk. Although it doesn't have nearly as much information, it does have one thing Circle Round doesn't: the rituals themselves. The seasonal rituals are actually family plays- a very creative way to celebrate a holiday. There are also songs, fun crafts, and recipes for each holiday. This book also goes into detail with life passage rituals. Even Pagan families who are not Wiccan may find this title helpful."
1,What can I say? I didn't like it.,It read like all the other Wiccan books popping up everywhere. Same old stuff. Save your money.
5,I can see clearly now the rain is gone,Purchased these to replace some old wipers on my 1994 Oldsmobile Bravada. Delivered on time and well packaged. Good wipers for the money. Would buy again.
5,i liked it!,"amazingly weird. weirdly amazing. i don't think it's exactly ""horror."" it is different. and for someone who has watched a bagillion movies, watching something different is a delight.the acting and cinematography are excellent. just don't expect it to be a straight forward story that makes complete sense at the end."
5,Full of ideas,"I saw this in a friend's library and couldn't wait to get a copy for myself. I'm not a book maker but it has creative ideas that can be used for small albums or different ways of folding that can be used for ""explosion"" cards - not to mention books."
3,TURNER & HOOCH,"TURNER & HOOCH (1989), starring Tom Hanks, Mare Winningham, Craig T. Nelson, and Reginald VelJohnson is a fun, little comedy from yesteryear. The most remarkable character in the story is Hooch, a Dogue de Bordeaux, who provides the comedy through his interaction with Hanks' character, Scott Turner. Hooch is the primary witness in his previous owner's murder. Hooch is also a menace to an orderly home due to his rambunctious behavior and sheer brawn. Scott Turner is a small-town police detective who is set on solving the murder. Turner is also a compulsive neat freak (almost a predecessor for MONK). The comedy emerges between the collision of worlds as Turner and Hooch are thrown together, and Turner must share his home with the beast. This film is excellent for pulling out of the archives on days when a good laugh is just the ticket!"
5,Tom Hanks,"I love this movie. It has comedy, action, and is a tear jerker! Worth the price it's offered as."
3,Review of Turner & Hooch,"This is a very good movie. It has a somewhat simple theme with the usual Hollywood borderline language issues for young people but aside from these challenges, I recommend it for a good evening at the home movies."
4,THIS IS NOT BLU RAY,"searching for Turner & Hooch BluRay brought up this link. The movie is not in BluRay. it was a gift, and they were happy to have the movie, but they really wanted bluray. it was a confusing link at the time. oh well. amazon handled it well."
3,Screen format,"Was disappointed that the listing did not indicate that this was a wide screen version, which was not what I wanted."
5,Best Movie Dog,What a great movie. Ever since this movie came out my daughter has wanted a mastif just like Hooch. Thank goodness she can satisfy herself with this dogs antics by watching the movie over and over again. Although this movie looks very eighties/early nineties it has timeless appeal. Definately worth owning.
3,A man and his dog,"There are buddy cops. And then there are those like Turner & Hooch. The war begins when a ordinary, clean detective (TomHanks, who's wonderful, and comedic) must solve a crime with a slobbery, chew on people's shoes, mess with records and everything else that's your property dog named Hooch (who, if you're smart like me and see the end credits, is played by Beasley) must solve a murder he was witness to of a old man(and Turner's friend).The only big roles here are of Hanks,Beasley, and Mare Winningham, who plays Turner's doctor and girlfriend later on in this movie, but that does'nt stop it from being good, and it is."
5,Turner & Hooch,This movie makes you laugh and cry...Tom Hanks is soo funny in this movie and the dog...you just love him!!!
4,Hanks best work since Gump... good acting by Hooch,The feel good movie of the year... some gratuitous shots of Hooch's doggie balls kept me from giving it a 5 star rating.
4,Great movie,"If you love dog movies, you should get a kick out of this. Good acting. Anyone who has had a dog can relate to all the stuff Hooch manages to pull off and attendant frustration."
5,Tom Hanks is always great.,"Nice to see a fun movie and with Tom Hanks you can never go wrong. 5 more words required, sorry, that was all I had to say."
5,Awesome Movie,We haven't seen this movie in a long time... Glad we did! Why the hell do i have to write sooo much
5,Love Hooch!,Awesome Dvd. One of my favorite movies. I bought it for my pres teen son. It is now one of his favorites. I receive it within 2 days. The Dvd played just fine.
2,Funny but could be better,"Tom Hanks perfomance is very good, but the dog is very ugly indeed,I think with another dog would be better...The film don't deserve more than two stars."
4,It's A Cute Movie But The Ening is Very Sad!,Turner and Hootch is a cute movie about a cop played by Tom Hanks who has to look after a dog named Hootch and Tom Hank's character is a neat freak and the dog is very messy and This is movie is cute but the ending was very sad!
2,Just saw this again...,"...and have the same opinion I did when it came out. Other than a few mildly amusing scenes, not really a very good movie. Very cliche, not really funny, very silly in a bad way, and ""witness"" or not, anyone normal woul've brought Hooch to an animal shelter immediately after the first destructive incident."
2,Be Warned - PG is NOT what this movie should be rated,"Parents, I would strongly suggest pre-viewing this movie before allowing your younger children to see this movie. Near the begining of the movie, two people are murdered; and while you don't ""see"" it, you can hear it. You also get to see Scott Turner (actor Tom Hanks) running around in his underwear. Plus there are two or three sexually suggestive scenes - one is a very heavily suggestive scene.If you could cut those scenes out, this would be a great film. You just have to love the mastiff playing Hooch, and the scenes where the dog is destroying things is just plain funny!"
5,Great and funny ...,"Like so many of Tom Hanks' movies this one does not disappoint!! I had seen it when it first came out, but my children, and some folks I work with had never seen it. It is another one that you need to have for your collection."
4,I love this film,Tom Hanks is really funny in this film. Hootch steals the movie and just about every scene in it. I love when he destroyed the apartment and the neat freak had to deal with the mess. This is even funnier than the Man with One Red Shoe.
4,"This movie was a bit violent, but other then that.....","I first saw Turner and Hooch on TV and it made me laugh! Then as i got deeper into the movie I realized it must have been rated PG before there was a PG-13, it was violent and had some other content (Although not much) that made me wonder if it should be on so early in the day when tiny little kids could watch it. But to any dog lover that is over ten I do recomend this movie."
4,HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS MOVIE?,"I know this movie is a tad corny..... no, actuallly it's incredibly corny, but come on, Tom Hanks and a pitbull? What can you not love about this movie? This movie is pretty much your classic-stright laced guy gets some type of animal aganist own will, hates it at first, but grows to love it as much as a child type of movie. Yes, I may sound crazy and immediately after reading this you will probably vote aganist me, but trust me after you've seen Turner & Hooch you'll understand."
2,It was okay.,"This video was okay, I was looking to start tinting for my job and need a video to help me catch up to speed with the world of tinting. This video DID HELP some of the areas I was unclear on. I have not use any tint since watching the video.I feel that the video is over priced for what it is (22mins 10 mins explaining why w-tint is good to have.) But it did clarify a few points.BTW the guy at the end of the video does a p00r job on the back window.just my 2 cents."
5,NEGATIVITY,ATA OLUJIMI COMMENTS ARE MOOT. SEEMS TO ME THAT THE COMMENTS ARE MADE BY SOMEONE WHO DID NOT LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE AND IS VERY JEALOUS OF MR GATES SUCCESS. THE WHOLE SHOW ON PBS WAS RIVETING. I AM AN AMERICAN OF COLOR AND I APPRECIATE WHAT MR GATES DID.
2,early nubia,"NUBIANS were powerful and were a world power and a super power before the 25 dynasty as well and earlier like kerma and even earlier,like the a - group and pre-kerma and even after the 25th dynasty they were still a super power.In fact they were richer,more advanced and THIER military more powerful after the 25th dynasty.Their empire was larger too."
3,Death and pestilence never sounded so good!,"I couldn't give it 5 stars because the quality of the performances is patchy, and because I was spoiled by listening first to a whole CD of Growling Tiger. Still, the spark is there. The recordings are a bit tinny but considering they were made in the 1930s they're pretty good. They are full of wit, wisdom, and women who spend all your money and cheat on you.One of the highlights of the CD is the Lion's *Fall of Man* You may read its chorus ""Through the abuse of the Divine providence, Mankind was doomed to suffer death and pestilence,"" and scratch your head, but it's hilarious when the Lion sings it, honest. The other song not to miss is the Caresser's *Exploiting* (i.e. ""Buy me a Zeppelin"").This is your basic 30s calypso, with the trumpet section playing backup, not the super-traditional bamboo band sound that Alan Lomax recorded later with Growling Tiger (in case that's what you're looking for). Buy it. Love it. They don't make calypso like this anymore."
4,Sleeping becomes a positive act instead of a passive one,"I have a feeling that this book will become another classic bedtime story. It encourages young ones to think of something positive and happy before they go to bed. It encourages them to look around their surroundings and nature to find joyful thoughts. The idea that ""the morning likes waking you up. That's what makes the morning happy"" is so unique. Going to sleep becomes something purposeful and fun because that is the only way the morning could ""wake you up."" In another word, going to sleep becomes a positive act instead of a passive one. What especially makes me love this book is that the one who is soothing the little bunny (who is afraid of nightmare) is her big brother instead of her mother. This very positive book is an excellent bedtime story as well as a good choice to deal with sibling relationship. Ages 4-8."
2,There are so many other books more worthwhile...,"I received this as a gift for my baby shower and found it a little disappointing. The overall morale is good (a story about finding things to be happy about in your life... counting your blessings... an older brother helping out his little sister) but it's not very well written in my opinion.The use of repitition of the character's names is very cumbersom to read aloud. (Willa said, said Willoughby, asked Willa, Willa asked, and so on.) My son will not sit through one page of this book. The story drags on too long and could have been written in half the number of words. The illustrations are nice, however."
1,tell me somerthing happy before i go to sleep,"Not the most easy to follow, flowing story i have read, the 2 characters names willa and willowby were repeated to frequently and were quite a mouthful to be saying over and over again.I loved the title which drew me to the book, and a great idea for a children book"
3,How 'bout happier?,"I, as a non-artist, can think of much more inspiring reasons for a small child to be happy at bedtime. Disappointing and shallow."
2,Names are too repititious,"Although the illustrations are great, overall, I think the book could have been much better written. The story is a sweet story, but the names of the characters (Willa and Willoughby) are used over and over. After a couple pages, it wears itself out while I'm reading it to my 2 year old.That said, I have just decided to omit the names while I'm reading it, and my little one does like the story. It seems to get her in the right frame of mind for bedtime."
4,A great book to read before bed,We just received this book as a gift for our two year old son. He instantly started following along with the characters and he loved the vivid pictures on each page. A great story that can be read over and over.
3,Charming Illustrations,"The illustrations in this book are charming. The text itself wasn't quite what I was expecting. More about why you need to go to sleep than about ""Happy thoughts to sleep/dream by"" Still, the pictures are beautiful."
5,Practical Book,"I took on the project of constructing a database application to track our customers since there was nothing out there off the shelf that would do exactly what we needed done. I had not programmed in 12 years and did not know a first thing about VB.NET or object-oriented programming. The book is so well structured that I managed to build a database application from the ground-up while learning to program all over again within 6 months - it would have taken shorter but the only times I could dedicate to the project was nights and weekends. And guess what; after I beta-tested the program and ironed out the bugs, the program never even crashed once! On average 15 concurrent users are on the program and enter about 200 transacions daily. This book helped make my project a success."
3,A reader from NJ,"A good book for experienced VB.NET / ADO.NET programmers but if you were, you wouldn't be buying a book on the subject. Maybe not intentionally, but there are many important details omittted from the program examples. Many will not work because of the missing information or assumption that ""you should know this"" or it was overlooked."
4,Highly Recommended,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET by Doug Lowe, Anne Prince. I found it to be comprehensive yet concice. It is a particularly effective combination of pratical examples and theory, and I know that I will refer back to this book for years to come."
2,BETTER TRY ANOTHER BOOK,"Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET is geared towards a classroom, like college or university, if you want to learn yourself, you are stuck, it doesn't provide step-by-step instructions on how to create projects or samples, the web site lets you download instruction for exercises and projects, but you are in tuff luck, because they won't provide you with any solutions to the exercises and projects. Try Wrox press and Apress books, they are better geared toward to the self-learner."
3,Not for people with database and ADO.net basics,"This book is basics of both to database and ado.net.If you are really looking for step by step basics of databaseand ado.net go for it,else this book is not for you."
2,should look for better book,"this book is more of a guide to teach someone how to program, but when you are alone and stucked, you can't find any solution."
4,ElectroFunkFantastic,"This is perfect eletro-funk as far as I'm concerned. A healthy blend of jazz, funk, and hip-hop. I first discovered King Kooba while listening to an Om Lounge album and it really stood out especially because a lot of the Om Lounge stuff kind of sounds like porn music. Nufoundfunk is really chill and relaxing the vocal tracks are soothing as well as blissfully mind numbing. If you like this you might also want to check out DJ Swingsett.Enjoy!"
3,King Kooba - Nufoundfunk,"King Kooba abandons the jazzy breaks and drum 'n' bass that marked their first two albums for more of hip-hop feel on NUFOUNDFUNK. And while it's not a bad album per se, it doesn't quite have spark that made their other albums memorable. The cuts on the title track aren't convincing, and while the vocals on ""Feel the Colour"" and ""Fooling Myself"" are acceptable, they don't necessarily add much feeling to the tracks themselves. But as texture on the slow and dreamy ""Find A Way,"" it achieves a graceful feel. The downtempo jazz of ""Cosway Street,"" however, showcases what's good about King Kooba. ""Space Jam"" rather convincingly combines both the hip-hop and jazz tendencies. ""Sans Filtre"" delivers some easygoing house, and the final track, ""California Suite"" is summery funk. So while King Kooba has found a new direction, they haven't quite yet found their way."
4,Gotta Like King Kooba,"This is a great disc. It is well worth adding to your cd collection. I heard of them on many different compilations I have and finally acquired a copy a la Amazon. I would have given it five stars but sometimes it gets a little ""out there"" which isnt a bad thing but just not a complete five star outfit."
5,Highly recommended,"I sharpened my turning tools free-hand and that had been frustrated exercises. I bought this jig and the task was a breeze; after the setup, it took literally seconds to sharpen the gouge to the desired angles, no fuss!An important note: the jig has to be installed right under the grinding wheels, so your grinder must have a small base. That is, the base cannot be extended to the grinding wheels (look at the picture). I could not install this jig to my new Sears variable speed grinder that has a larger cast iron base(I really wished that I could), but it works well with the other older grinder. Still highly recommended."
4,"Great Curriculum, good condition, fast delivery",Connecting math concepts is a great math curriculum and the book was delivered very quickly and in great condition.
4,good drawing/learning tool,"excellent book for the budding artist, or those who would like to hone their skills. reasonably priced, and highly recommended."
4,Crucial Accoustic Blues,This album is well worth a listen. Good choice of songs and well performed by the accoustic artists. It is getting played constantly at true blues gatherings.
4,A New Cookson - At least to me,"I was so excited to see that Catherine Cookson`s books have been issued in an e-book format and with a good price too.There have been some later books that were not issued in the US, among them The Lady on the Left. While it certainly isn't my favorite, the plot was good. It doesn't take place in her usual haunts; in fact the setting is a generic seacoast town."
1,WOW!!!!! GREAT JOB CAVIAR!!!!!,This is by far one of the greatest bands to come from Chicago. I can't wait to see them on tour. The record is great!!!!! Can't wait until their second cd comes out.
4,CAVIAR DELIVERS MUCH MORE THAN EXPECTED ON THEIR DEBUT CD!!,"With the already popular hit ""tangerine speedo"" caviar is starting to get a fair share of radio airtime. But if your worried that ""tangerine speedo"" will be the only song worth listening to on this Cd, YOUR WRONG! This Cd is so good the band is being put on movie soundtracks including Charlies Angels and Gone in 60 Seconds. CAVIAR will make a great gift for yourself or your tangerine speedo lover."
5,"Great CD, Greatly Underrated","I bought this CD after hearing a couple songs and deciding that even if it was just those two songs I bought it for it'd be cool. To my great surprise there wasn't a single dud on the CD. Songs like Goldmine and Tangerine Speedo are totally over-rated, jaded, Don Juan anthems, whilst ""The Times Are Over"" and ""I Thought I Was Found"" are the type of song where you park the car, lower the seats and pull back the sunroof or take the top down and put the moves on that girl you've been wooing. Then you and your buds can rock out (and brag about your manliness) to ""Flawed Like A Diamond"" later that night in celebration! Can't lose. Buy now."
3,"Not original, but well executed...","Caviar sound similar to many of the alt-rock bands saturating the airwaves -- this could be any one of the 100 bands in Chicago's Q101 rotation. But while their sound may not be unique, it's well executed. Big hooks, lots of melody, and two-part and harmonies are present throughout the disk. Sounds something akin to a Blink182, Matchbox 20, Smash Mouth, etc. The track that made it into the ""60 seconds"" film, incidentally, is not the best here."
2,Blake Smith Sells Out,"It's a shame that a writer as gifted as Blake Smith (late of Fig Dish) feels the need to offer up novelty tripe like ""Tangerine Speedo."" There are some nice tracks on this album, but the band is clearly not interested in making the challenging pop they are probably capable of. If you want super commercial RAWK why not just buy the Creed albums and get it over with? What a waste of talent . . . . but I'll probably go see them when they come to town anyhow."
4,Good product,"I got this for my mother in law, and she really likes it. She says that its a little difficult to put the top on the base, and it won't work unless you do it right. But other than that it's great."
1,Stay Away!,"The tempurature control broke after only a few uses. Cuisinart sent a replacement (obviously remanufactured)and made me pay to ship my old one back. The ""new"" one appears to be going out after even fewer uses. I am not going to throw good money after bad by getting another replacement."
2,Don't go there,"I have owned this product for the past five years, and it is very good. However, the probe/power supply attachment has broken 4 times, despite the fact that I have handled it with scrupulous care. Cuisinart has replaced the probe twice, but is no longer willing to do so. In spite of the fact that I have been otherwise happy with the product, I will not spend $25 to replace the probe, since it is clearly an inferior piece of equipment and is likely to break again. Instead I am forced to replace this grill with the GR-55, which does not have a separate probe/power supply accessory and has better reviews."
5,Great multi purpose grill,"I work at a high end kitchen store and we do not sell this, we sell All Clad versions. I say versions because you have to choose EITHER grill or griddle - you do not get both in one appliance (in order to get both with the All Clad model, you would need to buy two seperate appliances @ $250 each.) Another huge plus on this machine is that the grill / griddle comes off for easy washing, whereas the aforementioned appliances do not come apart for easy cleaning. I have had this a few months and I love it!! I have nothing but postive things to say about this!"
3,Robert Calvert - 'Rehearsals 1987 - Radio Egypt' (Voiceprint),"I had sort of forgotten about this rehearsal CD collection of Robert Calvert tunes. Obviously, these recordings were (for the most part) recorded initially on cassette by eager fans to compliment their Calvert lp's they already had. The opener, another Calvert tune that I simply do not remember ""Diamond Mine"" was good - plus I also liked ""Machine Song"", ""Acid Rain / Ship Of Fools / The Right Stuff"" along with ""Ejection / Silver Machine Blues"" (a rearranged version) of Hawkwind's only number one million seller ""Silver Machine"". Maybe it's just me - but do you think that Voiceprint or possibly someone in the Robert Calvert estate is sincerely trying to milk his repertoire dry? Nothing wrong with that, as I've seen it happen before with deceased artists."
5,Solid,"The quality of this gate is certainly there. The gate itself is made of heavy guage metal and the fabric is durable and attractive. The closure on the gate works nicely, too. The only improvement I'd suggest, and you can make it yourself, is that you need to drill holes into your posts or walls, and, in addition to having to deal with those later on, if you don't know what you're doing, the gate can pull out of a wall. What we ended up doing is taking out the pivots at the end (They snap out when you press a spring-loaded button), and wrapping straps around the rails with long lengths of velcro at the top and bottom. It makes a very strong and secure joint, and there will be no repairs to do later on."
3,Mediocre,"Not a terribly sturdy gate, but gets the job done. We use it to separate the living room from.the area where the wood stove is in use, so that our LO is safe. So far so good, but it is a bit flimsy. DH will be adding custom reinforcements to help add a bit of rigidity."
1,Try Folding the Gate,"Well, the gate is fine if you never take it down, I guess. However, we use it to keep our dogs out of our living room, and when we have company we like to fold it up and put it away. Even though we loosen them before closing, the plastic tensioning knobs at the swivel joints have bound up and cracked in half, rendering the gate useless. For $100, I expected more. This is a poor design, compounded by cheap materials. Summer, you need to fire the engineer behind this garbage!"
1,Piece of junk,"The was the only gate we could find to keep our 11 month old out of the kitchen. In a few short months each of the 4 connections to the walk-thru portion in the middle had cracked. Now the hinge covers on the 4 corners are all broken. We had to literally tie the pieces together to hold it up until we could install a homemade gate. My toddler was able to pull on the gate and break each of the components with his minimal strength. Because it is made to accomodate awkward spaces, it is flexible and won't lock stiffly into place. The flexing motion was more than the plastic could handle, so every time he pulled on the gate it gave a little more. We installed it exactly the way the instructions described. I'm still trying to get my money back. I gave it one star because you can't rate a product with zero."
4,"Good Gate, Great Service","I purchased this gate for my family room/basement to allow my daughter room to play w/ out the dog dirt from my animals coming in from the dog door. The first gate came broken but with a short e-mail to Amazon/babyage, a new gate was on it's way and arrived in only 2 days (before I even shipped the broken gate back)The gate was relatively easy to put together and has held up well for us so far. The only reccomendation that I would make is to have some sort or grip or something for the supports to grip the floor so that it doesn't move back and forth. We put a chair and a shelf on each side of it and it stopped the problem but I could see it being a real problem if the gate was opened all the way up like ours is w/ nothing holding it from moving around.With just some items at the ends to help reinforce it the problem is gone for us."
3,Great gate for a short time.,"We've had this gate for about 10 months. Last night when the gate was opened, it just came right off. It appears that the hinges just gave out. Up until then, it had worked perfectly."
3,Not for Drywall,"The door works well, the gate was easy to install, but it should not be marketed for drywall in Any way. It comes with anchors that are too flimsy, so I bought the best anchors on the market. It took my 11 month old, who is not even walking yet, one week to rip it out of the wall.Unless you have a stud to screw this into, do not buy this product."
4,so far so good,"it keeps my 15 month old away from the oven, its easy to open with one hand, when i have her on my hip."
4,Great gate,We had to find a solution for a wood burning stove that stuck out from the wall 2 feet and also a large off center entry way and the 2 gates worked perfectly!
4,baby play yard,"I do my research on everything that I purchase. This was the most durable and heavy gate that I could find to build a large play yard that actually looked decent. I did not want a plastic gate that would slide or be easily pushed (I have tile floors). I purchased two and a gymnastics mat that my daughter will be able to use when she is older. I spent $325 all together; however, most people spend around $200 or so on a pack and play that they can only use for a year and this I can use for a lifetime... It wasn't as easy to put together as I thought it would be, but worth getting if you are looking for something long-term."
4,It's great but could be just a tiny better!,Let me start by saying that I really love this gate. The only thing i would change is the how the gate opens and closes. It sticks a little and is hard to get used to.
3,Comes off hinges,After reading the other reviews posted I bought this gate. I only have one complaint. The gate keeps coming off the hinges if you lift it up too high when opening it. This happens quite a bit and can become extremely irritating. They need to put a nut or something on the hinge pins so they don't slip out so easily. Other than that I like the gate. It conforms to fit unusually shaped large openings.
1,Cheap Made Comes Apart And Breaks,"Hi, I bought this gate about two months ago. First of all the knobs that you use to loosen and adjust the position of the gate can be loosened by a young child. Second of all, the top hinges that adjust the shape of the gate broke. The gate is now in three pieces. And third, the way the gate closes allows for fingers and toes to be pinched. I have put the gate out in my garage. It has no more use in my house since it is now broken and has very sharp edges."
3,It's only okay,"Don't get me wrong, the gate serves its purpose. I am not happy with this gate because it is difficult to close. Since it is difficult to close, my husband and I find ourselves leaving it open, which defeats the purpose. We have another gate that is self-latching, which is great, but will not cover an opening of the size that we needed. I did a lot of searching and don't think there is much out there to secure such a large area. :("
2,Wide but....,This gate was a great fit for our extra wide area at the bottom of the stairs. It worked well for about 9 months until my almost 2 year old figured out how to open the gate. The latch is a thumb slide and has little resistance so it is very easy for him to do which kind of makes the gate and the $100 a waste.
5,Just What I Expected,"The gates arrived during the week and we installed them on the weekend. We had two very large openings and this gate was one of the only that would fit in the openings. The other gates had received very poor reviews. The gates look fantastic! The coloring and design fit very nicely with our decor. The only thing we did differently, as recommended by other reviewers, was to use longer wood screws to install the gates. We were able to place them where we could drill directly into studs and I would recommend that if you do not have studs near where you are installing to get a ""bumps and bruises"" when she crawls into or falls into the barrier."
5,Great product!,"If it is installed on wall studs - no problems should occur. I can see though how easy it might be for older toddlers of 2,5-3 y.o. to open it. My child tries to open it even now and he is much younger than that. He can't open it because he can't reach it very well yet."
4,Great for non-standard door openings.,6 years ago my husband & I could not find a gate for the entryway into our living room because it was too wide. When we finally did find one it was nearly $200! To be able to find one that is a great quality and fits perfectly for under $100 is such a blessing this time around. I LOVE the swinging gate. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because the gate only opens to 90 degrees. It would have been more convenient if it could open all the way to 180 degrees so when we want it open the gate is not in the way.
1,Shipping issues....,I will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed! They need to repackage items like this for shipping. It it the second and the last item of this type I will order online. The other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed. I have complained before but never get a response...too bad too as I like Amazon.
2,It broke in many peaces very fast! Its very fragile! I'm very disappointedDidn't like.,"Very fragile! Dont worth it! It broke in many peaces. I thought that I could have this for my son but less than one year after I bought, many peaces were broken."
1,"New Model Cheap Quality DON""T BUY!","If you buy this product, make sure the model number does not have an a at the end(07160A). We have three of the old model, but this new model is cheap. The parts and bars are all smaller in diameter and bend and rattle and shake.They no longer fit with the old models. We are returning the 2 that we bought and looking for something else. I will never buy from this greedy company, Summer, again. Once again greed is overpowering the safety of our children."
2,Fits Large Opening but Cheaply Made,This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free! By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out!
4,Good gate to have for a large open area!,"I bought this gate to block off and turn my dining room into a playroom for my baby girl. It was fairly easy to install, and so far it seems sturdy. All in all, I like the gate, it is doing what I needed it to do. I also bought this gate to block off the area from our little 3 lbs pup, I was concern at first if it would even keep him out because the gaps on each side of the gate door is a little wide, but it seems to be keeping him out now that he's put on some weight......but if you have a smaller and skinnier dog, it might not even work. Just letting those pet owners out there know.........thanks!"
5,Great Product!,I purchased this gate because the opening between my living room and dining room and kitchen was 110 inches or more it was very easy to install I wouldn't recommend using the template connect all pieces then mark you screw holes with a pencil. It took about 30 min to install BE SURE to position gate where the velcro is on the outside of area if using for a baby so they cannot pull velcro off and escape babies are pretty smart figuring things out unnoticed It comes with a 1 yr warranty on all parts and when the velcro became a problem I called the customer service number and gave them the product number located on bottom of walk through part and also number located on the bottom of walk through part and they were more than happy to replaced the gate I have recommended this to several people!
1,Poorly packaged...crumbled pieces,I should have been warned by the many reviews complaining about receiving this item broken... Poorly packaged + poorly manufactured = no fun dealing with return & leadtimes.
1,Doesn't hold a 9mth old here....another velcro complaint!,"As many other people have complained, the Velcro design on the gate is ridiculous. Our 9 month old has it totally figured out and the gate is now worthless. We have only had the gate a month. We bought two and combined them to make a play area. The design for that was great....just the Velcro is inferior. I am going to try to hand sew the door on to see if we can save ourselves the $200 I wasted. It also doesn't matter which side the Velcro in on, the inside or outside...she just pushes on the mesh and the Velcro pops open. Don't buy this one!Edited: I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement with the Velcro sewn shut. It now works great. I would give it a 5 star now!"
1,Hello....Removable Velcro Door?,"This is junk!My 20 month old grabbed the top corner, pulled & ripped the whole cloth door OFF! Fortunately, I was right there because he headed straight for the stairs! I had to sew the Velcro together with some heavy-duty thread. I would not recommend leaving your child alone with this gate for one second.I will post some pics latter..."
4,Nice Gate,"We have had this gate about a month. It blocks a large opening so our daughter cannot access the kitchen. The gate works great if the little plastic triangle part of the latch is out. The gate will close without the little plastic part being out, but our daughter (13months) has figured out if she pushes real hard she can open it. Except for this minor issue, it works well for us."
5,Great Reading,"The essays placed in this book are very well written (of course).Since I am using this for an English class, it have been a verygood reference as well as a good read.Strongly suggest this book."
2,Not All That Life-Like,"This toy takes 3 AAA batteries and is described as a life-like newborn baby chimp. It does make a few chimp sounds but they aren't all that impressive. There is very little movement of the monkey and it isn't ""life-like"" either. It comes with a cheap, plastic bottle that you sort of cram into the chimp's mouth - the mouth doesn't move or open. It is cute - the best feature being the soft latex face that looks very real and has beautiful eyes. My 4 year old, who loves monkeys and babies, played with it for 20 or 30 minutes and then set it aside. It's just not very engaging."
3,"Excellent book, but not tried and true in a homeschool setting","I agree with much of what the other reviewers have said. The only caveat I have is that the author has not personally implemented the course of study he lays out, and the schedule, with his own family yet."
3,GREAT songwriter,"I am a fan of Rush and the B-52's and I like John Tesh. Some of the slow songs are dull, but Barcalona and all his fast songs ROCK. Not many reviews here. and one is from a loon. People are missing out! Remember, critics hate quality. They hate RUSH...enough said."
5,The talent of John Tesh!,John Tesh is so talented. He truly has found his calling in this world. He brings spiritual peace and lives by his belief.
2,This should be classified as fiction,"This book purports to be a true account of the author's adventures in Tibet in the 1930's.Foreigners were not allowed into Tibet, so the author claims he disguised himself as a Tibetan and learnt the rudiments of the language.However, his story is full of holes and just doesn't add up.Tibet is very remote and one man alone would not find it easy to enter.In fact, he gives no details of how he entered the country.The more I read, the more suspicious I became of the truth of this book.The author had blue eyes and always adverted them when he met people.This would raise suspicion.He was German, and going by his picture in the book he looks nothing like a Tibetan.He says he stained his face each day to make it darker, but this would have made him look like some comic actor.It just doesn't add up.He must have stuck out like a sore thumb.He propounds his own religious ideas instead of giving an accurate picture of Tibetan religion.This book cannot be taken seriously."
4,The Best Summer cd for your car,"When I say ""semi-chill"" I mean music to relax to but not fall asleep to. People get all up on this title saying that it isnt good for a lounge, who cares? This is the perfect cd to have in your boom box if you're suntanning on a towel in the middle of a park.....Don't believe me? toss this disc into your cd player as your out enjoying the summer and toss it on track #3. Life will begin to define itself :)"
3,"Check out my review for OM Lounge, Vol. 5","Essentially this is the same album as OM Lounge, Vol. 5. A very good soundtrack for kicking around your house one night or if you're having a relatively upscale gathering at your house (pate, no thanks, I'm trying to cut down).I wouldn't recommend it for intense listening. It won't really stand up to the investigation. Good for aural candy though."
2,It's OK..,"I only listen to No.3 out of this series, and I still will. This one leans toward being experimental (or?) sounding, and there is better available in that genre for free on the Internet. This CD goes with such non-favorites/wish-I-hadn't-bought as Looper in my collection."
2,disappointing compared to the other 3,this is still loungey and all but it way too sappy to be as dope as the first three (especially 3). it still has it's moments but overall it's not what i was hoping for.
2,One lounge too many ..,"I'm sure alot of people like me have bought this CD because they've bought the other three in the series, after all it was a safe bet was'nt it ? One was very good, two was excellent, three was absolutely sublime and four, well it's pretty poor really. This CD blurs the very definition of lounge, there are tracks on this album which are blatent vocal house, good in the right room but not in my lounge. Om should think very hard before they release another lounge series CD if this is the best they can do !"
4,An interesting read,I did find this book very informative. I feel like it made me think or ask questions about why we tend to trust doctors more than our own bodies. Don't get me wrong I think doctors know very much what they are talking about most the time. But it did make sence to me how the book talked about how a normal healthy pregnancy many times is rushed or sent in for a c-section all for the sake of time. There were a few biased oppinions in the book. And some sections seemed repetative ( this is the reason for the 4 ) But I think over all it was not a waist of time. And as I do with all information I recieve it was taken with a grain of salt. Additional advice: try checking it out at the library before you decide to buy it or not. Depending on your beliefs this may or may not be the book for you.
5,Beautiful,"If you aren't sure about a hospital birth, this will help you decide. Additionally, it isn't a ""home birth or else"" as some ""alternative birth choice"" books can seem to be. Very nicely considered birth centers, the medium ground. Overall, very well-written and thought-provoking. My husband and I even had several good discussions when I brought up points in the book."
4,A good choice,"This book is definitely biased toward natural, vaginal birthing. If that is fine for you than this is a great choice. I found it very informative. The author gave a history of childbirth and how it got to be so medicalized. Medical myths were also addressed. The succint pro's and con's of typical hospital interventions I found especially helpful. The differences between midwifes and other providers came in handy for me because I was contemplating ditching my OB for a midwife. Finally, they had in depth info on waterbirths, creating birth plans, choosing a provider and birthplace. Definitely worth reading. I did watch the video also. Besides it being a bit dated, it did show the gentle births that this book is all about. I think the video would have been more helpful if it showed more 1st stage labor. I was hoping to see more of how the women coped with labor pains then to just see second stage."
3,Not really comprehensive,"If you don't like the ""normal"" childbirth paradigm, then this book offers a good review of some other options. It especially covers water births and has good information on the advantages of water births.However, the sections that talk about common obstetrical practices are very poorly written. They are exageratted, and undocumented, and don't take into account anything that doesn't support the focus of the book.Overall I enjoyed reading it, and recommend it for women who want more choices in childbirth. But I also recommend that you read other books as well. If you only have time for one book, don't read this one. Read ""The Thinking Womans Guide to a Better Birth"" by Henci Goer."
1,Outdated and Opinionated,"This book is very outdated and the opinion in it is very slanted. I would rather read a book that states facts from both sides, not a one-sided bashing."
3,"great book, if you are on the fence","I was pretty sure I wanted a midwife when I bought this book. I was hoping for an instruction guide to birthing gently, more naturally, with a CNM rather than an OB.What this book actually is, is a guide to deciding what kind of birth to have. It's a bit preachy, too, not unusually so, but not exactly openminded, either. So if you are wondering if there is a better way, but don't know anything about midwifery or homebirth, you might learn something. If you have, say, researched it on the Internet, you might already know what this book has to say.I would recommend one of Ina May Gaskin's great books before this one."
4,A Test of Dedication,"I bought this puzzle last Christmas for my wife and daughter to work on together. Little did I know that it would be completed and finally off the table in our family room 11 months later!This is most certainly an expert level puzzle, and requires the most patience of any puzzle I have seen to this point. Shades of gray and hundreds of solid black pieces add to the difficulty in addition to the obvious large number of pieces.My only complaint would be that the pieces are not as durable as I would expect given the price tag for this product. The edges of some pieces frayed a bit during the time it was put together. This is slightly disappointing since I intend to frame and hang the finished product.This puzzle provided many hours of family entertainment and based on that it was worth every penny!"
4,After 2 years,"After 2 years of off and on (mostly off), I've finally completed this puzzle. I must say it was VERY challenging because there are only 3 colors: white, black & gray. You'd think that'd make it easy, but no, maybe if it were a 1000 piece puzzle yeah. It was especially hard at the very end of the puzzle when all I had left were blackISH pieces, everything starting looking the same. All together, it really took me 3 to 4 months to do this puzzle.I'm missing one piece though & the website where you can request missing pieces are no longer offering missing pieces for this product :(All in all, I enjoyed this puzzle immensely & am glad to say that I'm back in the puzzle game after several years of absence. Now if only Amazon sold a puzzle table."
4,FOR THE PROS,"This one is a tuffy. I completed the Sistine Chapel 3000 and it was a breeze compared to this one. Because there is little color variation, it gets very confusing. After 2 weeks i was able to complete the border and the center part that has little lines all over... on the third week i completely failed at finding a single piece to fit anywhere, got irritated and took it apart.This puzzle tests the love for jigsaw and is for the truly dedicated (aka someone with a lot of time)"
4,this puzzle will drive you mad,"If you're looking for quite possibly the most challenging puzzle ever created...this is the puzzle for you. 3000 pieces of grey scale make this puzzle about as easy to put together as our nation's failing economy. I can't wait to see it all finished but i fear this puzzle might lead to my insanity and instead i'll take in 50 cats, quit my job, and spend the rest of my days watching reruns of Judge Judy while sewing quilts made out of old pairs of my underwear. Ok...wellBack to the puzzle. It talks to me now..did i mention that?back to the puzzle"
3,Fun and fast,This was an enjoyable read for a night. A little mystery without a lot of blood and gore.
4,A Good Read,"The plot drives this story more than the characters do. Hellmann does a great job with the Eastern European aspect of the story, where she touches on human trafficking and forced prostitution. The one problem I had was that Ellie Foreman, the main character, kept referring to some sort of nameless danger she got into in the past that, from what I gathered, had to do with her video editing career and the police. However, that was never clarified. Consequently, the character and aspects of the story felt incomplete."
1,dissapointing,"I expected something a little more meaty from these books (""Craft"" and ""Italian Witchcraft""), especially since Grimassi is supposed to have been raised in the tradition. What I got was a blurry New Age philosophy that states in the intro that is is a modern adaptation of stregheria, thus not the real thing. Caveat emptor!!! I read them anyway, since I had spent my money on them, and neither had any impact on me other than sadness that I had wasted it."
4,A Very Good Album That Never Got The Recognition It Deserved,"This album was released after Year of the Cat and Time Passages, Al Stewart's two most commercially successful albums, but this one didn't achieve the commercial success of Al's two previous albums.Thta's too bad because this is a really good album. I don't rate it a 5 star, as I've rated many of Al Stewart's other albums, but this is a very solid 4 star album. It has some excellent music, great lyrics and the high quality of musicianship that one typically finds on Al Stewart albums.For some reason, this album never got the recognition it deserved. But that doesn't change the fact that's it's still a really good album. If you like Al Stewart's work, you'll like this one."
2,No Common Thread,"The shoddy cover art suggests that, after three great albums, Al Stewart was losing focus. 24 Carrots? I know it's a joke, but is anybody laughing? Sonically, this album is similar to Stewart's previous releases, but the songs don't fit together well. There's no common thread. ""Murmansk Run/Ellis Island,"" one of Stewart's best historical narratives, is the highlight, but the rest is lacking. The goofy ""Mondo Sinistro"" still makes me wince. ""Midnight Rocks"" is pleasant enough, but unlike most of Stewart's other hits, it lacks depth. It's extremely repetitive and the lyrics have nothing to offer beyond vague cliches about romance. The first song, ""Running Man,"" is the perfect indicator of what's to come. The man in the song is running, but he has nowhere to go--the perfect metaphor for Stewart's songwriting here. If you're interested in Al Stewart, ""24 Carrots"" is not the place to start."
5,"Great Writing, Great Reading for all sports fans",I love reading this guy.Eric Hansen is a journalist with a flair for telling stories about Notre Dame football that go beyond the history of the Fighting Irish. Author Hansen's knack for painting the picture of the athlete and their connection to the Golden Dome uncovers the mystique and tradition of Notre Dame football. The foremost authority of Irish Football creates another page turner. I'm buying a case of books for my friends who love the Fighting Irish. My Christmas shopping is almost done.
1,HOOSIERS BEWARE! Indiana not included here!,"Hoosiers beware! I bought this book and then realized that it doesn't have a section on what to do in Indiana. I live in Indiana, and thought (rightly so, of course) that it is located along one of the Great Lakes, and therefore would rate a mention. What were the author's thinking? That's like writing a tour guide to Europe and leaving Italy out. You'd feel robbed, right?That said, I do look into the book when we plan to travel to Illinois, BUT what a misleading title! Now I'm going to try some other guide like Fodor's or Frommer's - people who really understand geography... and don't try to mislead people with their titles! ARGH!"
3,Okay if you are new to craps,DVD is a good buy for anyone that is new to the game. If you are looking to learn about dice sets or to see specific dice throws or outcomes don't buy it I bought it because it mentioned something about strategies and dice throwing but not what I expected but like I said its a good buy if you wanna learn about craps
4,very nice centerpiece....i love it,"its a very nice item, good, very good quality....thank you amazon....you did it again....."
4,Good yarn.,Good yarn. Good price. Why Amazon can't have all the skylark books in one set and all the lensman series in another is beyond me. They are all out of copyright and all out of print.
5,If I had been Seaton....,"I know it probably would have demolished the plot, but if it had been me, when I was face-to-face with DuQuesne on the Valeron after Blackie called for a meeting, I would have had several object compasses dialed in on Blackie to keep track of him later.Love the book, too bad Doc didn't write a bunch more Skylark books. It would have been on the shelf next to my Hardy Boys books and my Tom Swift collection."
2,"Fun read, but Kindle Edition has the wrong line breaks","The Skylark of Space is classic space opera, and is a window into a different era of science fiction, while still being completely fun. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition has line breaks in the wrong places, making it extremely uncomfortable to read.This seems to me to just be a sloppy translation, and hopefully it can be corrected."
5,Best of the Skylark series!,"Hard to come by but well worth the trouble this is the rest of the story of Mark""Blackie""DuQuesne;one of the most interesting characters in scifi.Perhaps more interesting is 'Doc'Smith's treatment of sex & social nudity:I smell Bob Heinlein's influence here.Classic space opera with a twist.Recommended."
1,not interesting,"As a commercial pilot and former air force WSO, I was interested in a book about being an airline pilot because I plan on pursuing this work in the next 26 months. This book wasn't it. Finally just put it aside after almost reading the whole book. Found my faq aviation instructor handbook a more intersting read."
3,Adventure of becoming an Airline Pilot,"This was an interesting book about a Pilot with a rather unusual career.However, as a Pilot myself I hoped for a lot more detail, particularly on technical matters, interesting but it could have been a lot better."
4,"very good book,",especially for western muslims. it explains in great the detail about the history of naming
2,Didn't fit on my zune,"The protector I got wasn't the right size for my Zune. The seller refunded my money w/o having to send the item back, so I have neutral feelings."
5,Simply great. Highly recommended.,"My best advice: First see which part of the guard and cover is the actual guard. Then remove cover from underneath, so dust doesn't fall on top of the sticky side. (Dust can't stick if the sticky side is on the bottom.) The chances of placing the guard perfectly without dust and bubbles decrease every time you take it off. I used lens cleaner to remove dust from the sticky side, and it actually looks better now that the first time I put it on the Zune. Yes, this is only for Zune 30 GB. It works, though. Crystal clear. You'd never know there was a guard on the screen. I had two large scratches on the screen, not deep, but noticeable. This guard hides them pretty well."
4,Only one.,"I was hoping to get more than one and it turns out I got one with my purchase of a red silicone skin from Nextweb Sales, but the cleaning cloth was a nice add."
5,Rhoda was a fun show,"Rhoda was one of the few cases of a spin-off that I liked better than the show it spun off from.I'd love seeing Rhoda and her friends and relatives. The marriage might have been a mistake,but there were real standout shows.My two favorite actors on Rhoda were Julie Kavner,whose Brenda turned out much more patheticly loveable than Rhoda ever was- and Lorenzo Music,who made an impression without ever really making an appearence."
5,Recommended to our entire support group,"I run a support group for parents of children with food allergies and continuously recommend this book. Resources, contacts, food family listings, nutritional requirements for age groups, recipes, substitutions, supportive stories....it's all in there. A very practical book. A must have!"
1,"12 pages of information, 5 photos",This book contains ONLY 12 pages of information and 5 photos. The book should sell for 50 cents or less. Good infromation from Tony Sale but the publisher should be banned from selling 12 pages for any more than 50 cents. Great book if it were at least 50 to 100+ pages like most paperbacks.
5,no babytalk,"Having read many books about Tibetan Buddhist principles and meditation techniques, this book is by far one of the best. Wallace writes for the skeptical, intellectual Westerner. Many Buddhist books written by Westerners either use baby talk or are too sirupy. Because of this, I preferred those written by Tibetan teachers - until I came across this book by Wallace.A. Heinz, Cape Town"
2,too out dated,"I was looking for a unique vegetarian cookbook, but this one is way outdated.. uses alot of Tofu ( aka processed soy)."
3,an OK adoption book,"My kids have gone through phases of requesting this book at bedtime, so it rates a few stars in my opinion. But it's not great. I have two main problems with it: (1) It is very highly focused on the adoptive mother. Her feelings, her sadness, her loneliness, her reasons for adopting, her actions. I prefer my adoption books to be more kid-centered. (2) It's just way too long and wordy. So many details are provided that in my opinion add nothing to the story. Every time I read it aloud I abridge it more. To end on a positive note, I do like that it's a true story and my kids will ask things like ""where is Pan Pan now?"" Having another child's true adoption story available to us is a plus."
5,Awesome,This was the greatest book ever when I was a kid. I used to make my mom read it over and over. Now I have 2 boys and they love it too. It's so much fun!
4,"Great pliers, annoying spring hinge","These are high quality, good grip, sturdy pliers. It is annoying that they're on a spring that keeps them always open (makes them hard to store), but I knew that from reviews before I bought them and it doesn't bother me since we just store them in a box anyway. It's nice to have needle-nosed pliers with wire cutters, very useful tool."
4,Read reviews so you are not surprised,"I needed some needle nose pliers for some work I was doing on my motorcycle and these were well priced. I enjoy that the pliers are easily held and spring open (read on for caveat). They do what they were designed for. Order them and you will not be disappointed.One thing to note (the caveat): Because they do spring back open (as other reviews state), they will not stay closed for storage. Others suggest using a rubber band for storage, but I just leave it in the tool box and it causes no problems."
4,consitently excellent release,"This is one of my favorite purchases in the past 12 months. Dave Aude knows how to make tracks that make you feel good, and DJ tracks that don't take a minute just to get going. I would give this CD 5 stars except I find this one song, Paralyzed, extremely annoying. Highlights are the original, Common Ground, and Too Good. Miami music as it should be."
3,What's wrong with DeadLands?,"This would have been an excellent cult/B-zombie movie except for one not so small detail......films are called films for a reason. Cheap camcorders, iPods, iPhones or whatever people are using to FILM zombie movies nowadays is killing the genre. Yeah digital recorders enable anyone to make a movie but that ""Movie Quality"" is always missing....shame to, the story and plot points were excellent and the movie never strayed from what it was saying. I wouldn't buy or rent this again but I'd watch it again."
1,save your money,this movie was a waste of my time and money. the only good thing about this movie is it ended!
4,A pleasing and realistic zombie flick....,"While obviously shot on a limited budget, the director and cast make good use of the material they have. I was very engaged, and I am a huge zombie flick fan, although it should be noted I tend toward those flicks with equal amount plot and blood. Which this movie, most impressively, had. The low budget contributed to the ""real"" feel of the scenes...I felt as if I were watching a home movie of a zombie invasion. VERY well done...SURPRISINGLY GOOD...yes, you are left hanging, and hey, leave 'em wanting more! Well done by all. Must be seen, zombie lovers."
3,Ok for a Low Cost Rental,At a $1.99 this was Ok entertainment.Shot on video--film would have been way to costly for a project like this--it was entertaining without being absurd.Plot holes--yes. Ending left me feeling a little cheated.
4,DO NOT buy it if u bought the other Kaplan + CD-ROM,"This book provides great exercises to practice your verbal skills. It has practice questions at the end of each section as well as THREE practice tests for each of the three different types of verbal questions. Finally, it gives you one full-length GMAT Verbal section test. Lessons are written very clearly, with good tips and examples.BUT, if you have the other Kaplan book that comes with CD-ROM (math + verbal), DO NOT BUY this one as it repeats some of the same questions (quite a lot!)."
3,"""cdma2000"" should not be in the title of this book!","This book has only one chapter on cdma2000, most of which is a re-work of what's available from standard specifications and freely downloadable from .... The use of ""cdma2000"" in the title of this book is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as the book provides little insight beyond what's readily (and cryptically) available elsewhere. The treatment of IS-95 is deeper, particularly on handoff. Coverage of power control is terse. On the whole, this book provides good grounding for IS-95 (cdmaOne), yet leaves the reader to make appropriate connections to cdma2000."
3,MIGRATION FROM IS-95 TO CDMA2000,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A COMPLETE OVERVIEW FOR CDMA2000 OR A DETAILED COMPARISON BETWEEN IS-95 AND CDMA2000 THIS BOOK WILL NOT GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT. BUT IF YOU HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF RF DESIGN, IS95 CONCEPTS ARE EXPLAINED DETAILED ENOUGH TO GET THE BASICS AS WELL AS CDMA2000. EXCELLENT. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GENERAL IDEA ABOUT CDMA TECHNOLOGY BUT NOT FOR ADVANCED STUDIES."
2,Not for beginners,"I have had this book for a couple of years. Reading it following the chapters of the book, I was frustrated by the lack of cohesion. New names were introduced without much explanations. Index section could be more complete. It is somewhat useful as a reference for certain details"
1,. Soft Handoff and Power Control in IS-95 CDMA.,Introduction. Types of Handoff. Pilot Sets. Search Windows. Handoff Parameters. Handoff Messages. Handoff Procedures. Setup and End of Soft Handoff. Maintenance of Pilot Sets. The Need for Power Control. Reverse Link Power Control. Forward Link Power Control.
2,Cuisinart CSC650 Slow cooker,"Not a bad slow cooker, but the knobs on the front cracks and you are not able to set to proper controls. Called Cuisinart to order replacement knobs and was told the knobs are not a replacement item. The only resolution is to buy a new unit. We have a number of Cuisinart products and the new attitude is if it's broken, buy a new unit.We would not buy another Cuisinart product, the quality is just not there anymore."
1,Sucked,"I bought this for my husband as a gift. He was very excited. The first time he used the machine, it burned the food to a crisp and dried up all of the liquid while it was on the low setting. We were lucky it did not start a fire."
1,Shame on you!,"All I can say is that I'm truly grateful we live across the street from the fire house! Boiling mad, ha, I must be on warm!"
3,"looks nice, works well, but the OUTSIDE gets scalding hot!!!!","We received this slow cooker as a wedding gift, and I've used it at least once a week for over 4 years. I really like the size, however, the metal outside gets so hot I have several scars from bumping into it over the years. The porcelain dish just cracked last night (no fault of the unit) so I'll have to replace it....and I'm not sure I'll buy another Cuisinart. I have a toddler, and limited counter-space, so I worry about her reaching up and getting burned on the housing.It was great while it lasted, but I'm hoping for something that doesn't leave a scar next time!"
1,Low is a HIGH boil!,"When will I learn? My Cuisinart bread maker was a dud, the food processor worked about 10 times before the motor died and now this... Why can't someone make an attractive appliance that also works?!After reading other reviews, I gather that I have one with a thermostat problem since ""low"" brings the food to a rapid boil.. and never lowers back down. It does burn the food if there isn't a lot of liquid, like in a thick stew or roast. I will try to put it on warm and see how that goes, but I would not recommend this item whatsoever."
2,Cuisinart Slow Cooker,"The CSC-650 was what I thought I was ordering, what I got was the PSC-650... The unit is easy and intuitive to use.Most disappointing is how the lid doesn't really fit the crock. It doesn't fully rest on the rim of the crock, so there are gaps down the long sides of the oval - it is not retaining all of the moisture it should.The lousy fitting lid pretty well precludes pork roasts, being leaner meat they just dry out. It's very disappointing when a respected name ends up on a poor quality product."
2,Was looking for a SLOW cooker,"I've cooked several different dishes with this appliance and luckily I've been home to shut it off in time. Every recipe calls for cooking 6-8 hours on low but my dishes are done after 2.5-3 hours; I can't help but think it's taking away from the flavoring of the meal. I've tried pork chops, chicken, stew meat, pork roast, etc and all with the same result. I would not buy this product again or recommend this to anyone as a quality slow cooker.It's pretty easy to clean though and mine has held up. I like the retractable cord also."
1,"Temps are not safe, falls apart, SHAME on Cuisinart!","I bought THREE of these for a buffet party. 2 would never get hot, UNSAFE holding temp for food. Afterwards, cleaning with a just a damp cloth, the writing by the indicator lights vanished. I used the only properly working one a second time, and the red plastic light cover fell out and broke on the floor. So much for 3 all lined up looking nice for a party! Too late to return, so be warned, although they look nice at first, don't fall for a 'pretty face'"
2,"I received a replacement model, and it works perfectly. 4 STARS!",Cuisinart Customer Service shipped a replacement to me for my faulty model that was boiling vigorously on LOW. This replacement works great! Love it! 4 stars!P.S. The computer program wouldn't let me change the star setting to 4.
3,Just a Warning,"I was ready to purchase this product and was told that it is being discontinued because several parts, including the handles are known to break. I ended up purchasing a 6 qt Rival."
2,"Worked really great for 3 years, FIREHAZARD now!!!!","I chose this product because of the brand so I expected premium quality even though it's made in China. The cooker looked and worked wonderfully for about 3 years. It started functionally erratically and so I removed the cord-winder and found that the electrical connection between the cord roller and the main unit had gotten so hot that the insulators and connectors were charred and the plastic near them melted. It seems we would have had a fire if the now exposed wires had come in contact with the very nearby steel body of the cooker. If that happened, an electical shock would also have been likely! Maybe this is a fluke but the insides of the unit appear to be constructed as ""cheap"" as possible. Very common with appliances today but not what I expected and thought I paid for with a Cuisinart!"
1,A Waste of Money,"I was excited when I bought this item. It looked wonderful! However, it boils/burns everything. Forget leaving it on if you leave the house. And, Cuisinart Customer Service is impossible to deal with. Now they're telling me I can box it up and send it back for a replacement. Do I really want another one? NO!! Would rate it zero stars if I could."
1,Waste of money,"I have gone through 2 of these now and both ceramic inserts have cracked in the same place! Cuisinart customer service is not interested in replacing the inserts even though I have only used it 2 times before they cracked and were unusable. I had to send the pot back for replacement and the replacement had the same trouble.My cheap Rival crockpot that I had for years before I purchased this one never had problems or I would think that this was operator error. I was really looking forward to using this because I love all my other Cuisinart products but I am going today to purchase a nice, inexpensive, reliable Rival crockpot."
5,Great Pot!!,"I love this slow cooker. I read all the reviews and wasn't sure I wanted this pot but when I read other reviews they had just as many complaints.I bought this one, kept the box and receipt because I was expecting to bring it back but I was pleasently surprised. I have owned it for about a month and have used it many times (I have never had a slow cooker before) everything comes out great, it seems very safe when I leave it all day and the pot just pops into my dishwashed each night. I don't see a lot of bubbling, it cooks very slow and the lid fits great. After reading the reviews I have to wonder if there is a batch of lemons out there. I bought the William Sonoma cookbook along with some of their sauces and the recipes are very easy and good."
4,Easy Street,"WOW! I have owned a couple of different smaller models over the years and this is by far the best. The worst I ever owned did not have a removable inner pot and therefore it was a nuisance to clean, so be sure you do not get one of those. The pot in this comes out for easy cleanup. My favorite thing to do is prepare some chili or a stew the night before by adding the ingredients to the pot and then placing it in the fridge until the next morning at which time I put it in the cooker, turn on the slow setting and head out the door to work. Guess what...dinner is ready when you walk in the door and it doesn't get any better than that. The appliance will switch to a low warm setting so you do not have to worry about burning the house down. Oh what will they think of next? I LOVE IT!!!!"
1,Awful Slow Cooker,"This was given as a wedding gift, bought off our bridal registry. It is our first slow cooker and we chose it because of the Cuisinart name. I agree with the other reviews, it looks great - but steam does comes out of it and it definitely burns food. It's burned 3 dishes already. If you have to watch a dish that defeats the purpose of a slow cooker as you can't leave it on while you're at work. Knowing that newer cookers ""cook hot"" I have tried to decrease the cooking time - but that didn't help because it still cooks when it's on the warm setting. I'm returning this piece to the store tomorrow and buying another slow cooker."
1,Temperature regulation issues and broken parts!,"After cooking with our Cuisinart CSC-650 Slow Cooker on three occasions, with less than successful results, we are giving up. First, unlike numerous other reviews I have read here, our Cuisinart slow cooker never heats up enough. Perhaps Cuisinart over-corrected the overheating issues that other users have mentioned. It is very disappointing to have company over and have to tell them that the food isn't ready yet, only to have to end up using a pot on the stove to finish the job. Second, one of the ""feet"" broke off of the bottom of the unit. I can't imagine using it sitting lopsided on the counter. . ."
4,CSC-650 Slow Cooker works great,"Retail price on this unit is $149, Amazon price was $99. Rival cooker with bells and whistles is less than $50. Question I had to answer is ""is this worth the extra $50 - $100?"". I gave the unit as a gift to my daughter. She loves it. She says it doesn't get hot on the outside so children don't get burned. It doesn't over cook like many units. The low temperature is really a low temperature. She loves the feature that keeps the food warm when it reaches the designated time. To her the Cuisinart was worth the cost difference."
5,Cuisinart CSC-650 Slow Cooker,"We have 3 Cuisinart appliances now. For good reason I have trusted the brand and found the slow cooker no different. Easy to operate, convenient and turns out an excellent meal."
1,Original song is great and THIS SUCKS!!!,"Will Limp Bizkit ever stop doing these stupid things??? First of all,they covered this awesome song and then added the line ""Discover L.I.M.P"" in the middle of the song,in other words claiming that this is there original song.Secondly Fred`s voice TOTALLY SUCKS in this song.So just SAVE YOUR MONEY and don`t buy it."
3,neutral,"if it wasn't for the fact that it's a cover and not an original, i doubt this song would have received this harsh criticism...i agree that it might seem poor in its minimal repetitive structure, and i'm not much a fan of the additional middle bridge...but aside from that, i think mr Bizkit's voice makes a pretty good translation of the lyrics...and layered with beautiful guitar play on a bed of dark pads, the song turns out to be a quite touching ballad on its own"
3,Not Typ. Bizkit,"I am a HUGE bizkit fan. This is NOT old Bizkit, but good studio work. Lots of criticism from Bizkiteers who don't know much about music. When Durst is on, Bizkit ROCKS, but there's no real trace of Choco Starfish here. The WHO remake is the CD and it's good to see that Durst can do both. Didn't feel the rightwing vibe that the Alabama kid did (above) and would recommend for the WHO song."
4,Lion by William Du Bois,"This is a children's book for kids age 5 to 12. It is about an angel that used to create animals for earth but forgot how to do it. He gets an idea for a lion and then gets help from other angels to perfect it.Its a good book, but a little long for bedtime. Its got Christian themes so if you are not into that you may want to stay away."
3,Starting to become out of date,"We are trying to use this book now in October 2010 as we had great experience with an earlier edition in 2006. Unfortunately when we went to ""La Fontaine Saint-Victor"" at 24 rue St.-Victor the building was being renovated and the restaurant was gone; Then we went to Montmartre (18th arrondissement), tried to find Le Soleil Gourmand --it was gone. So we went on to Le Maquis --that was gone too! However, we ended up eating at the new restaurant at that same address, and had a fine meal. --But better check ahead before relying on this 2007 edition in 2010."
2,This book is out of date,"This book is out of date. I was in Paris in July 2006- both restaurants I tried to go to were closed- La Cameleon and I can't remember what the other one was. Ms. Gustafson's descriptions are nice, but wait for the next edition (I had 2004's 10th.)"
2,She Shouldn't Have Changed the Name!,"We found this book very disappointing. Even with the name change from Cheap Eats, Gustafson still seems to concentrate more on the ""cheap"" than the ""great."" It was such a poor guide that we stopped using it after two tries, one a vegetarian restaurant, the other Italian. Actually, we found our Fodor's guide to Paris a much better restaurant guide than Gustafson's. Several restaurants in Fodor's were in the same price range but were superb in comparison, and fortunately we had some excellent dinners.The only thing to commend this guide is the organization. We did like looking up restaurants by arrondissement, and the maps were good. We wish the restaurants were as good. We were so disappointed that we left the book at our hotel in Paris rather than taking it back home with us."
5,I wouldn't go without it,"I happened across a copy of Great Eats Paris by accident. I was in love the first time I opened it. I was going to Paris a week later and when I arrived, I never left without it! My previous trips to Paris have always been hit or miss when it came to eating out. However after 10 days I never ate at one bad restaurant, except of course for a recommendation from a friend. Of course, those that go for Italian instead of French food in PARIS should be disapointed."
3,A Pretty Good Book for Paris Eating,"I don't know just how much you need a book on Paris restaurants that only reviews certain ones. That's what this one does. We found we were rarely near one of the reviewed restaurants and had to decide on nearby or convenient places on our own. Much to our surprise, we were almost always happy with where we ate. Plus, eating was secondary to our other interests, such as museums, parks, etc. But, if eating is your focus, then this book is a must. She's objective and quite thorough. And, there is a lot of variety. Of course, as you will find out, there is no such thing as a good ""Cheap"" restaurant in Paris. Be prepared to spend some money."
1,why not to shop with Amazon.com,"The last items I purchased from Amazon.com were cell phone batteries. The first battery I installed and it worked so poorly that the battery it replaced which was relatively useless in fact worked better than the replacement battery I purchased from Amazon.com. It appears I was scammed by nakpak from Brooklyn, New York in that one of the batteries I purchased was in fact a used worthless battery.Frankly there are other options out there for me in purchasing products.In the future Amazon.com will not be one of my options."
2,wall shelf,Loved the spiderman wall shelf if it had all the parts.... Missing the shelf. Too bad - it was perfect for my son's superhero room.
4,Gun Digest Book Of Gun Values,"Very good book,I think it could have had a bit more information though...But I am glad to have bought it...."
1,Stay away,This book made me want to take scissors and gouge my own eyes out for every reason imaginable. If you don't have to read it--don't. It will kill a tiny party of your soul that you simply can't get back.
1,Disappointed,I must not have paid enough attention - this is a 2000 version and thus antiquated. Be certain you pay close attention to details such as these!
3,"A decent book, but this information is free on the web","Yes, this book will guide you to web sites that will help you find the information you are looking for and also tell you the idiosynchrosies of the sites, but you can obtain this information by searching through the search sites on the web.They do save you some time, especially if you are new to the web, because they have done the initial searching for you."
5,Fun and Interesting,"Great Read! Full of history, yet easy to read. Great stories about the ""old days"".I went through the book in a day!"
2,Not what I thought,"I saw that Shaw Brother had made this film and thought oh wow a new Shaw Brothers film, well it's not what I have become use to when watching the old SB movies. The film was just lame plain and simple."
4,FAR OUT,"This record was a pleasant suprise! I have heard about GAM's legendary live shows, but have always missed them. This album is a psychedelic funhouse in the most punk sense of the word. Self produced and full of sonic treats. The sound is eclectic, reading almost like a best of album. Maybe a bit too long, but VERY GOOD!"
2,Poor Puncture Resistance,"I commute 150+ miles a week and have been using these tires for a few months - a few months too long. Although these tires are relatively soft and light providing a good feel and roll on the road, they also have a built in tractor beam for debris. The soft tread picks up sharp objects which then progress through the tire during use. The lack of casing to the tire provides little resistance to punctures. What started as a small cut from a chard of glass, ended up as a gaping hole that allowed the tube to bubble out and deflate instantly. Averaging 1-2 punctures a week is not acceptable, so it's in the recycling bin for these.If your a weekend warrior and want a good feeling cheap tire - these are a good choice. If you on the road a lot and want a reliable tire - I do not recommend these tires."
2,Finally gave up on these tires!!!,"I live in Arizona and usually ride from 75 to 125 miles weekly. 2 of the guys that ride w/ me recommended these, saw the price here (Amazon) went for it and got them. First couple ride was really nice quite fast tires for been quite smooth, I was really happy and impressed, really enjoyed those rides (the reason I gave 2 stars). Unfortunately, got 3 flats on my last 3 rides. Don't know if its just bad luck or what cause my friends state that that hasn't happen to them, but I just can't put up with having a flat every time I go for a ride :(!!!"
5,Awesome,"Smooth, fast, and sticky. What more do you need fin a racing tire? Expensive though, so I use cheaper tires for training."
5,Great read!,"This book is everything Christmas; stories, recipes, songs, poems, it has it all. Great gift for those hard to buy friends and family. It was received in a very timely manner and packaged very well. Very pleased with this purchase and the seller."
4,good christmas read,A good book for those that like christmas & me as well.Hope you fine people that read this book like it as well.It has a good section of the ways christmas is celebrated around the world & a section on the food of christmas including a section on childrens food.
4,Lots of Christmas info! Maybe too much?,"This is a very condensed Christmas in a book. There's just about everything about Christmas in this little-big book. You could get lost reading everything.The book itself is small maybe 6-8 inches in size, and about 3 inches thick full of information.It's a great stocking stuffer for that fact officianado in your family. A pre-teen kid could find it fun too, but perhaps as an early Christmas present, so they can read through it before the holiday approaches.This book is now part of our Christmas deco on one of our living room end tables. Makes for a good conversation starter too or just a great way to pass the time."
1,Should have been thrown away,"I ordered this book for a friend who is going to be laid up for awhile after some surgery. He is a history buff so I thought this would be a good read for him since we are planning a road trip into southern Oregon and northern California after he recovers from his surgery. What a disappointment. The book was published in the 1950's and probably spent most of its life in a high humidity attic or something. When I opened the package there was an immediate odor of mildew. As I thumbed through the faded pages, each page smelled the same. My wife who has a much better sense of smell than I, immediately condemned the book to the garage, where it now sits. My friend will never see that book. It probably should have been thrown away long, long ago. I'm not saying that the book wasn't interesting, it probably is, but it's a shame that it couldn't have been in better shape. My loss, lesson learned."
3,"sized right, priced wring","fits well on my ring finger and sounds good. Glass in my opinion does sound better than metal. I wish this was a little less money tough, 4.99 would be much more reasonable. I mean really, it's just a tiny jar."
4,Book 3A,"'To Green Angel Tower' is book three of Tad Williams 'Memory, Sorrow & Thorn Trilogy'. Originally one hardcover it was split into two parts for paperback, this being the review of part 1 (sometimes known as Siege) only. There are basically two major story arcs in this segment: the journey of Miriamele from the Wran and the the siege of Prince Josua's forces at Sesuad'ra.Although this is enjoyable novel it has a very high words to action ratio. There are some books you wish were fleshed out a little more- this isn't one of them.It really could be half as long with little loss. Having said that I did enjoy it and am looking forward to the conclusion."
5,To Green Angel Tower (Part 1),"This novel is one of the best books I have read, and I have read many books, most of whichare fantasy and sci-fi. To Green Angel Tower is masterfully written, and Tad Williams has done an outstanding job of making 800 pages seem like maybe 100. Thoughit is definately the longest bokk in Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, I think that it is the greatest among them!"
2,"I still read the books, but......","The story of Tad Williams' books are usually quite good, but the characters that he creates are the most annoying that I've ever seen. From their actions, to stupidity, to the annoying way that they talk, its all you can do to keep from gouging your eyes out. If you can cope with your desire to burn the book everytime you are faced with the annoying characters that you'd like to pummel with your fists if only you were there, then you may enjoy the underlying story."
1,why does everybody like this book?,"I can't believe how many pick this book over The Wheel of Time series! The only other highly rated series i hate more is The Sword of Truth (books 2 to 4) because TG copies Robert Jordan, but back to Tad Williams. I though that for an epic fantasy series this book was lacking. 1600+ pages in 1 book that didn't have the proper ending that an epic should have - he didnt do anything cateclysmic (no doubt spelt wrong). Over all the series could have been better if it didnt die after 200 pages in The Dragonbone Chair."
2,so so series (supposedly a trilogy),"One thing that kind of irks me about this trilogy is it is really a four part book series. The first two books are fine; then you come to this one. If you notice at the bottom of the title, it says Part 1. Yes, there is a part two, and it is actually longer than this book. Talk about contrived, this book series is a beautiful example of people running off to various places with much ado about nothing (with apologies to Shakespeare). The author has a number of characters running around chasing down various things, much of which is useless in the context of the main plot. Simon, the main character, shares a lot of time with other characters, the princess, and Prince Joshua, amongst others. I'm afraid shallow is the main word that comes to my mind when I think of this series."
3,It's on Kindle! Now where are parts 1 and 2?!,"I have been a huge fan of this series. The story gets 5 stars, easy. However, it drives me crazy when publishers release a series on the Kindle and don't release the entire series. Even more crazy is to release the last book first!If the publishers (and Amazon) truly want e-books to become a viable market, please provide releases of the full series and, even more importantly, make sure it is a good quality translation. Nothing says you're being treated as a 2nd class citizen more than the feeling that the book was just pulled off the shelf, scanned (with numerous typos, no book cover or maps) and slapped onto the Kindle bookstore."
1,Blacklisted - Georestricted - Not Free SF Reader,"Simon, Prince Joshua and Simon's old friend Binabik, the troll realisethere is a bit more to all of this fancy sword business than meets theeye. There are actually three of these fanastic artifacts, and one ofthem had been somewhere obvious all along. The old beaten up sword ofKing John is actually one of them, Doh.4 out of 5 (1 out of 5 for georestrictions)"
3,"memory, Sorrow & Thorn","Very Good, except for too many unimportant minor details, which have to be skipped over."
3,Just competent,"I picked up and completed a fantasy trilogy after a long time. The last time I was engrossed in fantasy was when I started on George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire although the 4th book in that series has considerably dimmed by ardor. Tad Williams has done a decent job. The parallels with Tolkein are everywhere - the Sithi (elves), the swords (rings), trolls (dwarves) etc. For most part, the books are enjoyable page turning fun. Williams does get carried away on occasion in almost interminably long dream and solitary wandering sequences which I started to find boring and a drag."
4,"Excellent writing, poor book binding","This thick book has larger typeface than the small paperback I read years ago, however the binding was poor quality and during the first reading the spine cracked open in the middle despite my careful handling of the book. It's an open question whether I got a lemon or this publisher's work is shoddy, but there it is. The book itself is highly readable and Ladislas Farago does a good job in balancing anecdotes with stating historical facts to keep the reader entertained while informed as well."
3,Thorough but a bit biased,"Reading this and Gen. Bradley's ""A General's Life"" concurrently. Interesting how the two differ in decribing the same incidents in WWII. Each is a bit biased in favor of the subject person. Of course Bradley's is an autobiography, so that accounts for a bias there. The Patton book delves deeply into Gen. Patton who was a complex person, and it does not gloss over his faults. But some of the military issues can be understood only by examing other sources as well."
2,The long and winding novel,"Carlos Fuentes is an amazing writer. He writes in a beautiful, poetic style. As a narrator, he notices even the minute details and brings them to life with his writing. The problem for me is that with all this attention to detail and poetry, the story seems to get lost. I would have liked the plot to move more quickly. Mr. Fuentes does not seem to be in any hurry to tell the story or stay on track with the plot. A scene my divert into a long, lovely description of nothing much, and the reader and characters are left waiting for Mr. Fuentes to return to the narration of the plot. It is, as I stated, beautifully written, it is just not a style for which I care."
2,Was looking for something with more substance.,"I was excited purchasing a Matthew Kelly book. However, what I was really looking for was one that offered more meditation and reflection material. What it offers works for those who like one sentence thoughts. That's not for me."
3,"Good in theory, so-so in practice","Clans of the Alphane Moon had a promising topic - what happens when a whole society is (severely and persistently) mentally ill. Although this is not a new idea in fiction, it is one of the first to have structured a whole work of fiction on this idea. Unfortunately, although the book starts interestingly with a characterization of various psychopathologies and their impact on the society involved, it quickly deteriorates to stereotyping and to engulfment of most if not all involved - including from another (human) society - in psychopathology. The end, where so-called normals become part of psychopathological society, epitomizes this undeep approach to human experience and behavior. There are some additional flaws that are more technical (and hence less important), such as the unbelievability of a psychologist and people who know her discovering late in the day that she is and has been for long (very) mentally ill. Still, the book was an entertaining and easy read."
1,Shark Sandwich,"I love PKD. But this book belongs at the bottom of the PKD pile. Don't make it your first read by PKD. Predictable, underdeveloped, ludicrous, and tedious, without the usual PKD reality or thinking challenges. Sadly, the best character is the slime mold."
5,Hysterical and Unforgettable,"CLANS OF THE ALPHANE MOON has so many hysterical, sarcastic and insightful passages you'll want to memorize most of the book. It's a wild, weird, quick read that is a great introduction to Philip K. Dick for someone who wants to jump into the fanaticism headfirst. Those not quite ready for complete immersion in the reality shattering world of Philip K. Dick should look at ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" or ""Time Out Of Joint"" and then read ""Clans"", but don't skip this one. It's a real joy to read. Philip K. Dick's death is our loss!"
3,A minor work?,"Interesting premise, great characters. Sluggish, unsatisfying plot. (I am a huge PKD fan.)"
3,this was just average in my opinion,"I'm a PKD fan for sure... but, he was such a prolific writer... and he wrote most of his stuff in such a short period of time. And sometimes it really shows.Clans is a fairly silly book... it has some interesting elements and all in all makes for a good read. However, this is in no way one of PKD's best. I would never recommend it to someone who wasn't already a PKD fan."
2,Feeble whisper from beyond the grave,"Like all the other posthumous PKD novels (""The Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike,"" etc.) this novel needs no further explanation for why it wasn't published during the great man's lifetime. Really, there's no reason to waste any time with it when you have a (well-edited, suspenseful) simulacrum called ""Valis,"" his never-topped Hugo winner from 1963 (""The Man in the High Castle"") and a much spicier, sadder and more compelling '70s period romp (""A Scanner Darkly""). This is really nothing more than a draft, and readers who think this is a masterpiece just haven't read enough of the master to tell the difference. The grave robbers should have been content with their ""Total Recall"" residuals and left the corpse alone."
1,False advertisement,"What I got was nothing like the one shown in the picture. The picture shows the Swiss pocket knife with a blade, scissors, file, memory card, etc.. I got one with just the memory card. :("
1,Not as advertised,"I had the exact same problem as another reviewer. Ordered this for Christmas, the description clearly states it's a memory card with knife, file and scissors and all I received was the memory card only model. It's obviously too late to get an exchange by Christmas! :\"
1,NOT as described,"To my disappointment, this USB pocket knife arrived without the scissors/knife/etc., JUST the USB key. It's called the ""Flight"" version of the piece. Ridiculous!! Get it together, Amazon!"
1,I'd give it Zero stars if I could,"It looked like such a great item at the time, but less than two months after the purchase, the memory key stopped working. Perhaps I got a dud product, but I thought people should be warned about the unreliability of this product. No value can be placed on the hours of work and amount of data that was lost."
5,Excellent Book A++++++,I purchased this book over the weekend and have read quite a bit of it. It has great advice and comes from a highly credible source. I work at a very large medical center and this book came highly recommended from my cardiologist. This is a must read for everybody as some of the rules have changed!
3,Too fancy recipes,"This is a good cookbook to use if you are cooking a special meal or something. But doesn't do much for you as far as recipes to use daily if you are on a diet. They require so many different ingredients that it will cost a fortune just to do a few meals from this book a week. Also, it doesnt' tell you preparation time. Not useful for what I wanted it for.The info on the actual diet is useful though."
1,Good Basic Resource,"This is a good basic resource for one searching out a weight loss program. The book reviews the popular weight lossdiets, medications, and available medical interventions, along with establishing healthy behaviors. It includessample 7 day menus, a chapter on identifying a healthy weight, strategies for maintaining your weight program,record keeping, and discussion of the obstacles to maintaining a healthy lifestyle program."
4,The TRUE story of the state of U.S. public pchools,"Berliner and Biddle have written an excellent book about the ""manufactured crisis"" in American schools. They show in great detail the ways in which standardized test data can be very deceptive and also how the tests themselves are not nearly as significant as they are made out to be by ivory tower policymakers. They accurately notice that the most pressing problems facing the public schools in America today are not the lack of standardization but the enormous disparities between the haves and the have nots which are magnified in schools. They have come to the common sense conclusion that public schools which are racially segregated, underfunded, understaffed, dilapidated, and/or overcrowded will produce lower expectations and results than those schools which have ample resources. Though the authors take cheap shots at private schools, this book is nonetheless a valuable rebuttal to proponents of excessive standardized testing and school vouchers."
4,An education policy maker's must read.,"This book has a shrill conspiracy theory tone that is not completely muted by its exhaustive documentation, and its repeated sneering references to ""neoconservatives"" and the ""religious right"" are both irritating and unnecessary. However, it convincingly refutes, point by point, the scathing criticism of public school education that I have read and heard for over twenty years. More importantly, it clearly articulates todays most serious and ignored problems in American education. I wish every policy maker from the local school board member to the President of the United States would read it."
3,Antiquated,"It's got good information. Had to read it for a class. But frankly, its very one sided in it opinions and leaves glaring logical discrepencies."
4,Must Read During the Current Testing and Accountability Crisis,"This is an excellent book that delineates the manufactured crisis that so many people believe is going on in the educational arena today. A companion to this book that I would also recommend would be ""The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism"", which details Milton Friedman's philosophy of unfettered capitalism after times of crisis. The current No Child Left Behind Act and so-called educational crisis create this manufactured crisis through the manufacturing of myths and the misuse of culturally, linguistically, and economically biased tests. The so-called crisis then makes it so much easier to dismantle public schools and replace them with charter schools. This book will delineate all of the myths that have been created surrounding the so-called crisis and offer evidence to contradict each myth. Anyone who is interested in saving the public education, then this is a read for you."
5,Needed!,"Except perhaps for Garry Wills' recent book A Necessary Evil, it is hard to find a book that was more needed at the time it came out than this one. No, our public schools are not perfect, but neither are they 100% imperfect, nor are they Communist--and Berliner and Biddle prove it with facts, not personal anecdotes."
1,It failed to convince me,"The authors of this book are clearly more interested in social engineering than they are with true education. The reader is bogged down with supposed statistics when no source for them is clearly listed, and meaningless graphs. The authors chose to rely on these statistics and their own rhetoric to present their argument. There were no direct personal observations that were in contrast to my direct observations with government schools at work, nor did I come across any interviews of teachers and school administrators. I have had candid conversations with both. My observations and conversations are a direct contradiction of this book's position. One does not need to be a right-wing conservative to be concerned about what is going on in our government schools. If this book is the argument in favor of government schools, I'll continue to educate my children in the home."
5,awe-ful...,"Considered the quintessence of Rilke's work, the Elegies invite the reader into conversations with chasms of despair and angels of light... and don't forget: ""Every angel is terrible."""
5,The BEST book on original Triumph TRs out there.,"If you are interested in the Triumph TR series, from sidescreens to the TR-6, this is the book for you. It is packed with a wealth of photos of original cars and cars restored to original specifications. Also included, lists of options, colors codes for both interior and exterior, and descriptions of each major automotive area: engine, chassis, interior, body, etc. A must for restoration."
4,Not what I expected but superb anyway,"I bought this expecting something breakbeaty but was pleasantly suprised to find some top class, instrument led house music. I've not heard vol. 2 & 3 ( vol. 1 was a bit unimpressive) so buying this was a bit of a punt but I'm glad I did.It's the sort of feel I get from stuff from guidance records, but more live. For those that're wondering that's a complement.Good stuff."
2,Heard it decades ago,"I was disappointed by the ""Designer Drum & Bass"" music on ""LTJ Bukem presents Earth 4"" - mainly because I used to listen to some very alike music in the late 70's and early 80's when ""Funk Jazz"" was going strong - a lot of this ""Earth"" music reminds me of a brazilian group called ""Azymuth"" (remember ""Jazz Carnical""?): same kind of singing, bass lines, and guitar and keyboard effects. At first listening I even thought that it was a remake of some of Azymuth's old tracks, which would be fine if there were any new fresh elements to spice it up a bit. But with these missing, the ""Earth"" music just flows by without living any deeper impression."
5,Easy read,"I checked this book out of the local library when I was was MUCH younger and enjoyed it immensely. A nice grouping of short stories that keep your interest and allow you to pick it up and put it down at will without losing much. The characters are delightfully put together and fun to think of, even though they're all fictional."
2,Save your money,"I expected to have at least a 30 minute video for each of the 5 love languages, plus other videos on the other chapters in Chapman's super excellent book.Buy the book, read it, consume it, read it again and again, share it!If you can get the video for $2.00, buy it. Otherwise, the video is only one hour long and he covers introductory material, the test, the 5 Love Languages and conclusion material ALL IN ONE HOUR. So, each love language only gets a few minutes. For $13.00, you should get so much more!"
3,Harley steering wheel cover,"I like the style and design of this cover. However, I find it to be a little too thick and the thickness makes it difficult to hold the steering wheel. My previous cover was suede & leather and was much thinner and was easier to control the steering wheel."
1,Very Poor,Well wrtten but its supposed to be history not literature.Conclusions reached show either a complete lack of understanding of military history or a complete lack of understanding of human nature.I would not waste time on it unless you want to find reasons to dislike Grant.
5,The best one volume bio of Hiram U. Grant,"That about says it all---this book is sufficient in details without getting too tedious. A well written account of this good general but somewhat inept, scandal-ridden, wishy-washy president who might have been a great one if his friend Rawlins lived for his two terms in office and kept him to his guns."
3,Not for everyone.,"I bought this book to do a full review. McFeely is very in depth about Grant, but there is so much extra information to get through to reach Grant. About half of the book was devoted to Grant's associations with people, places, and things. The book contains very little literary devices if any. It is very stale at some points. The book is not for people seeking to enjoy a book about the life of Grant. Instead to book appears to be more of a reference text for historical studies, not enjoyment. If you are wanting a personal view of Grant, this is simply not the book for it. If you are wanting historical knowledge of Grant with a dissenting, condescending view of Grant, then this is your book.I did not find it enjoyable at all, but maybe the Civil War scholar or buff will, but that is a stretch."
2,Unfeeling and Outdated,"Any good biographer has to have, if not sympathy, at least some understanding of his or her subject. Unfortunately, although this book is well researched, you get the uneasy feeling that Mr. McFeely is examining Ulysses Grant like a bug under a microscope. This is the classic example of an academic who lacks understanding of real life and as a result cannot grasp the dynamics of a man of action, as Ulysses Grant certainly was.Mr. McFeely also unquestioningly adopts the prejudices of prior historians without thinking for himself. As a result, an historian who DID think for himself, Frank Scaturro in President Grant Reconsidered, has rendered Mr. McFeely's book obsolete. Every biography since Mr. Scaturro has reviewed the Grant Administration with a fresh and generally favorable eye. As the last civil rights President before Harry Truman, Grant certainly deserves that revised opinion.Mr. McFeely's book is no longer worth reading, if it ever was."
1,Grant: A Biography,"It didn't take long for the negative tone of this book to make me ask, ""Isn't there something better?"" So I put it down, picked up Grant's Autobiography instead, and found this delightful, funny, humble man, whom I wish I could have known personally. Like others, I went on to read Bruce Catton's books. Those, I can heartily recommend, as they provide the facts that make sense, given what Grant accomplished. As a newcomer to the Civil War, through Grant, I finally understand why the strategy and politics of what he called the Rebellion, are so engrossing."
4,The Elusive Pueblo Live '66,This is a box set that includes the elusive and excellent Live in Pueblo 1966 album on CD. Chet is in rare form for the mid-60's for the Pueblo concert. Check it out!!
5,One of my favorite all time books!,"I found a ratty paperback copy of this book back in 1973, when I had just moved into my very first apartment- it was the first cookbook I ever owned. I still have the book, though I've since supplimented it with a hardcover edition as well.Ungerer is a wonderfully engaging and entertaining writer, and certainly knows her way around the French peasant kitchen, too. She entertained me, introduced me to a wonderful simple cuisine, and just as importantly, introduced me to the wonderful writing of M.F.K. Fisher. All that in one little book! Buy it and treasure it."
5,the best cookbook I have ever used,"As the primary cook in a rather large family, I am always looking for ways to stretch what I have and still make a satisfying meal. I found this book in the '73 hardback edition, and have just about worn it out- an almost daily tool. I have recommended it to everyone I know, and was happy to find it back in print"
5,"A witty ""cult classic"" much expanded and revised.","This author has also written ""Country Food"" and ""Summertime Food,"" both Random House books findable only in second-hand bookshops now. Although this writer has always had many rave reviews, she's never been a best-seller. Maybe this is because the public seems to be inamored of gorgeous picture books and Ms. Ungerer's are literary and teaching books. They are reader's books, rather than coffee table books. Maybe someday they will be available in a boxed set, much like Elizabeth David's, whom Ms. Ungerer lauds as one of her role models, along with MFK Fisher"
2,No sprouts yet,"I also purchased this when it caught my eye at a bookstore.I cold stratified the seeds for 1 week, planted them on 9/12/04, and 2 weeks later, I have yet to see any results.It would have been nice if the book would have given a hint about how long I should wait to see sprouts. All that's in the book is ""when the plants have grown"".Maybe some companies just make their money on impulse shoppers. After one product is sold, they move on to the next one."
1,A waste of money,"My sister received this as a gift, and she in turn passed it on to me. The seeds do not seem viable; I have not gotten a single sprout. The information in the book is not very helpful in terms of getting the seeds to grow. It would have been nice if they had selected a better variety for beginners.Yes, I followed all of the directions carefully. The problem is that there's really no telling how old the seeds are inside the package, and no commitment from the manufacturer to replace bad seeds."
4,Worked a charm,"I bought this item from a local bookstore as well, I didn't put the seeds in the fridge, I did soak the peat disk for around 10 minutes in pretty cold water.I planted all of the seeds, and around a week later 2 of them have sprouted. I only water them with very cold water, and i keep the ceramic pot on a plate which I tip water onto in the evening. They soak it up very fast and if I don't water them in the evening, the peat starts to dry out by the next afternoon. It dried out completely at one point a few days after planting, but this seems to have made no difference.4 days after first showing green, both of the shoots are around an inch tall.All in all, for a kit for a few quid, I'm really pleased with this kit, the pot is nice and sturdy, and my seeds seem to have worked fine. The kit also gives an address that you can contact if none of your seeds germinate, and they will send you more. Luckily, I didn't need to use this :)"
1,horrible,"i bought the kit and immediately started the process following the instructions, i put the seeds in water for 7 days then in the fridge in a damp paper towel for 1 day. i put the seeds in the poofed up peet pellet. in three months i have seen no sign of growth,AT ALL!!!"
3,vaguely (is that a word?) precise,"Ok, I bought this little kit. The instructions are good until you plant the seeds. There is a statement ""after plants have grown,"" where there is no picture or number of measurment on size or description of how ""grown"" looks. Otherwise, it's been pretty fun.Ultimately it needs MORE PICTURES and to be MORE DESCRIPTIVE, if the publishing company happens to read this.The instruction leading up to that point are good though."
1,i heard these kits are a waste of time,These kits are a waste of time please don't buy these kits save yourself the trouble and just buy a pre grown bonsai you can find those on amazon over time it's much cheaper then these so called kits
5,"G is for Genius, and Valorie Fisher is one.","Hurray. This book is wonderful. It's inventive and original. Why haven't I heard of this Valorie Fisher before? I see she has two other books? How does she do it? I wish they made postcards of these great photographs, they are so cool and intricately designed. I'd send them to everybody I know. My kids looked at the pages for the longest time--which is a miracle. I am going to buy Fisher's My Big Brother and My Big Sister right now."
5,Kept the pages turning,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It was well-written--especially the dialogue--and kept me guessing and surprised to the very last page. The author did an excellent job of weaving between 1948 and the mid-late 1800s, tying the stories of past and present together in a way that pointed to God's redemptive nature. Though this is the first book in a series, it didn't leave the reader hanging at the end (like too many series books do). All the threads of the story were satisfyingly wrapped up, yet I turned the last page eager to revisit the characters and curious about whose story Book 2 will tell."
1,You get what you pay for,"I was desparate for a new pair of scissor tongs. After only a few uses the center rivet is already rusty; but they haven't fallen apart yet. I purchase one of several brands just so we'd have them on hand as we grill 3 days a week. This one is typical. At my age I'm willing to spend the extra money for something that will last the rest of my life, but no such scissor tongs are available online. Really? We can't make these in the US?"
2,not so good,These are a little wonky. The hinge is loose but they work ok but nest time I will but better ones..
2,no other misleading reviews,"This book IS NOT a grammar the way one means when does a search here in amazon for grammar books. This is more, according to me at least, a historical grammar rather than a grammar of the actual language. Probably the second edition of this book is just a replacement of the cover , and the content stays exactly as it was in 1960 when it was written, with some adjustments in the preface.Personally I find very interesting this book for the richness of the vocabulary it provides, however it doesn t correspond to the actual language, and so it doesn t meet the purpose for which one buys it. It is mostly for very advanced learners who want to understand and see in depth how this languages has changed in a couple of decades. I am interested in the subject and I have not changed my mind for this purchase, but I am sure that many would do, especially because of this over-overrated price( in fact the major reason for the 2 stars )"
5,A godsend if you need a thorough and logical grammar,"Excellent grammar book! Mr. Lewis' book is supremely logical without being unnaturally systematic. The book covers the breadth of the lanuguage in a thorough yet extraordiarily concise manner. He, on occasion, will grace the reader with a bit of modest humor while remaining pertinent. Obviously an intelligent man who has an impressive grasp of the language and who from this learned perspective is able to break-down and effectively convey the grammar of the Turkish lanugage. The style is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are eager to grasp the scope of the language. Woe that he has not written a grammar for all the languages I have chosen to study."
3,Excellent but not for beginner.,"This book is an excellent resource, but not a good introduction to the language for a beginner. I'm glad I bought it, but didn't really start using it until I had been studying Turkish for a while. So, if you are sure you will reach a more advanced level buy it now. If not, it's better to buy introductory books that are concerned with teaching rather than being an encyclopedia of grammar."
4,"A new book of ""Sentences"".","A helpful compendium. For nearly three centuries the standard theological textbook of the church was comprized of the ""Sentences of Peter Lombard"". More commentaries were written on it than on any other book (the Bible alone excepted). The ""sentences"" were comprized of sentences (short excerpts) from classic works - along with pithy comments on each ""sentence"" by Peter Lombard. This book provides the opportunity for modern readers to interact with sentences from the past. In our dialog with ""The Sentences of Alister McGrath"" this reviewer is hopeful that a new genre of theological literature may emerge that transcends both theological hobby horses and the campish editorial opinion of the ""schools""."
5,A Step Up,This book is a great resource for theology study and research. Alister Mcgrath has written a book that it a step above most theoloy texts.
4,a pleasant first try,"The status of book fits the description, and the shipping speed vastly precede the anticipation, since no one would look at this(I guess), I'll say the four star above explains enough."
3,Overall coverage is good.,The book is of historical interest and traces the main ideas and controversies from the founding of Christianity to the present time. Some of the feminist material I don't find compelling. I found it to be rather dry and dense.
4,Class required textbook,Covers a variety of theologians over the centuries and various theological perspectives and doctrinal directives. This textbook will remain in my private library after the completion of my course.
1,Not the best,These bowls are heavy and not coated well. Black spots show through and I am not pleased with them. My own fault I guess but would not order again!
5,Good Charger,"This is a nice unit for charging. Definitely worth the 30 dollars I paid for it. Keep in mind, if you are expecting a lot of power from this, it may not be enough. Do the calculations carefully to make sure you have enough panel and some spare to charge up the products you intend to use this for."
5,Blessings beyond words,"What a beautiful man and presentation. Tolle is a miracle of Presence for a suffering humanity and I have gotten so much out of his subtle but mighty words. Highly recommended... Deep, deep, deep."
5,loved it,"Eckhart Tolle has a message, one we all need to hear. This information will improve your life."
3,Here we go again,"Well-written and an easy read.........But just another book attempting to prove what others have tried to do before....show that the nations leaders knew about the Pearl Harbor attack and just let it happen so the US was forced to join WWII. Anyone well read on the subject will see that without a list of sources with footnotes all of the ""facts"" given here can't easily be traced to their source. So you have to believe what you read. I've seen all this info before elsewhere.Ain't history great...you can write whatever you want if everyone you drag down with your ""proof"" is dead and gone.....well thats show-biz.Most would agree that Kimmel and Short, especially Kimmel, got a raw deal by taking the brunt of the blame for the attack, when the leaders in Washington should have shouldered as much or more of the blame. But why can't people just accept that the Japanese completely fooled everyone and carried out a bold and successful attack??But I guess that won't sell many books."
4,Works great for us.,"I have read a few bad reviews for these plug covers, but these work great. My son is one year old and they keep him away. Heck they keep me away. I don't look forward to using any outlet that these are in. They are hard for me to get out. I have to find something to wedge in it to pry it out of the outlet. So simply put these work fine. Maybe an older child would be able to get these out, but I can't so I am not worried.UPDATE: My son is now four and still can't get these out of the outlets. The plastic prongs have not worn out and the product as a whole still works great after repeated use. Definitely worth the small amount I paid."
5,King James and the Court of Funk,"First and foremost, Rick James was a dynamite producer who had an obvious affinity for Sly & the Family Stone, Graham Central Station and Parliament/Funkadelic, but also understood how to easily swim in the mainstream.But taking all that into account, the key to the songs was James throwing catchy hooks the way heavyweight champ ""Smokin'"" Joe Frazier could unleash the left variety in the ring. Super Freak and Give It To Me Baby are clubland classics - extended-play versions are also included on disk one - but nit to be overlooked are incredible tracks like Mr. Policeman, Ghetto Life and Below The Funk (Pass The J).The second disk is live ""punk funk,"" with James in full flight and at the top of creative/performance powers. This is an excellent collection that clearly shows the timeless energy from one of the best releases in the 1980s."
4,Long live the King of Punk Funk,"The Temptations was doing a reunion tour up in heaven, so they called on Slick Rick to perform ""Standing on the Top"". Because you are Rick James $&$^*. Rest In Peace My Brother."
2,Not as Durable as You Would Think,"The design that combines a hard top with a nylon bottom is great. That being said, like the others, my pull handle broke off after only a few trips. In addition, the hard top separated away from the nylon bottom in several places, and I have spent $$$ having it repaired to the point where I have spent more on repairs than the bag costs. It's a great bag for casual travel in the SUV. Try a different bag for heavy duty air travel."
1,Durability problem...,"Used this bag on 2 trips, one to Florida, and a second trip to China. On the return portion of the 2nd trip the top strap broke (handling by US Airways). Because of the hard top, this trap is riveted whereas straps attached to the other part of the bag are sewn. The riveted area is a weak point since the rivet actually cuts portions of the strap, and in just 2 trips it has broken. Since this top strap is the one used to pull the bag while rolling it along on the wheels, having a torn strap effectively eliminate use of the wheels and you are left with a heavy bag full of heavy golf equipment to carry...not a good solution."
1,A bad purchase,"I completely agree with the comment regarding durability. Same thing happened to my T-10: the rivets attaching the top strap to the plastic top pulled out, after only one or two uses. Of course, because I don't travel with my clubs frequently, this happened after the one-year guarantee expired, and Bag Boy wouldn't replace or repair the problem that its poor design caused.I was able to fix the problem, after much trouble, by replacing the rivets with nuts and bolts, but it was much more trouble than it was worth.Bag Boy has to remedy the design flaws of the T-10. Until it does, don't buy this product."
1,Bag Boy T-10 Travel Cover,The cover was too small to accommodate a normal cart-sized bag holding 14 clubs. After struggling with it for 15 minutes I returned the product to Amazon which was quite easy.
4,Other Books,"If you are really busy killing each other off, someone might notice.While the magic war between the colleges goes on, those that live elsewhere and don't like such annoying wizardly overlords see a rather large opportunity to help them with the whole killing each other off bit. As usual, the Raven, a levelheaded bunch running out of original members with the death of Ilkar the Elf do what they can to prevent the continent being destroyed."
3,Short and Sweet,"Have to admit that I was very let down when the 15 Anos de Exitos DVD showed up with only six videos on it...I didn't realize I was getting an abreviated rendition since it didn't indicate it as such in the product information, which is why I only gave three stars to it. But, as for the content, it is classic Alejandro at his best...Luckily, my always favorite, the LIVE rendition of ""Que Voy Hacer Con Mi Amor,"" is on it.All told, sweet on the eyes, sweet on the ears. But, they should let you know this is not the complete DVD version so you can scout out the full one and purchase that one instead. Luckily, his self-titled DVD has all the other ones you'd want that were missing on this one...especially ""Quisiera,"" which should come with a box of tissues. If you have these two DVD's you've got them all."
1,Alejandro Fernandez 15 años de exitos,Alejandro Fernandez15 años de exitosOnly 6 videos clips it should have all 15 videos included I saw the DVD at Best Buy
1,uniflame canvas log tote,I do not like this tote. It already has ripped and doesn't hold up to carryingfirewood. Would not recommend it to anyone
3,Does The Job,"I purchased this bag to replace my old log bag that lasted for 20 years. The ""canvas"" that this bag is made from is pretty thin and already showing pinholes from the sharp ends of the firewood. I don't think it will last 20 years but does the job. I like it but nothing today is made as good as it once was. When this bag wears out I will just get another one."
2,Not as durable as hoped,"Bought this for $30, now selling for $17. Probably a more reasonable price. Used it about 10 times and already got a hole in it. Nice to have closed ends but the hole defeats the purpose. After reading all the great reviews was hoping for something more durable."
3,Decent ... NOT great,"I gave this as a Christmas present, so I was a little embarrassed when they told me after the first week it was already getting holes in it. I wouldn't buy this unless you are hauling Duraflame type logs. It doesn't stand up to cut lumber."
2,Does the Job,"This is my second bag like this (my dog got to the first one so it's life was limited... the bag that is) and it really fits the bill. Very durable and handy and a clean way to transport wood from the porch to the stove. The first one lasted for years and I expect many more out of this one.Going to have to modify my review and reduce to two stars because the second bag is not holding up nearly as well as the first. The gauge of the material, that the bag is made out of, must be thinner/lighter. There are several holes started where the wood has poked through... I'll be lucky to get two full winters out of this one. Going to have to get out the duct tape to start repairing."
1,Light weight,This is low on cost and low on quality. Not for everyday use. You can do better at local discount store.
1,Did not receive book with cd.,I bought this package the Spy Kids The Underground Affair and I did not receive the book which you said comes together. I can not get into any of the activities so I am not pleased with this it is impossible to play or use without the proper items for example the book.Thank YouRyan
5,mother- child bonding,"this is defiantely one of the best childrens books ever written. it answers all the questions of ""why this or why that"" children always ask. if you have a little child or knows someone who does, i wuold strongly urge you to buy it as a bed time story, even a prenatal story. BUY IT NOW! you wont be disappointed"
5,The conclusion to my favorite series of all time.....,"I absolutely LOVED these books. I've read this last book many times, and I can never get bored of it.The first time I finished the book, I was surprised at the ending, and I got all sad because I didn't have any more Seventh Tower to read. I was forced to go read ""The Ragwitch"", which wasn't that great after reading the Seventh Tower books.The characters and their relationships with eachother are perfect: There's Tal, the reluctant hero, who is my personal favorite character (besides Ferek... but he's barely in the books... ^^), Milla, the violent Icecarl, Crow, the vengeful Underfolk who may not be all he seems, and many, many others.The plotline is drawn out PERFECTLY, and the ending is awesome. Me and all my friends absolutely LOVE these books, especially this last one.My only complaint would be the lack of romance.... a little Tal/Milla thing might have been nice... but that's just me. ^_^"
5,Great,This was the best series I have ever read for young people!!! I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.
5,All's right with a world,"The final in a series that brought the plot to the proverbial happy ending. Not knocking a happy ending, there are way to few in real life. Enjoyed the ending, was not ""normal"" but satisfactity"
3,"Good,, but rather short","THis will end up being a hodgepodge review of the entire series becuase each book blends into the other. The characters were strong and well portatryed, and the cultures were fairly believeable.Thiss book is also perfectly fine without any 'romanctic' element. it doesn't need one. It's expected, but unnecesary, and probably would have mucked up the plot a bit.I also enjoyed the many sides to the war. With the Icecarl, rebels and steadfast Chosens, Garth Nix pulls it off well, whereas other authors just might have made it confusing.But i have one question? shoun't the seventh tower hae seven books? i searched for weeks at my local library before realizing, no there is no seventh book.Every cloud has a silver lining, but how am i supposed to reach the silver? It's so high...-qoute taken from a book of qoutes i recently found"
5,I am writing to try to reach Pat Booth.,"Pat, I have the hottest story for you. It is a true story. It deals with money, power and murder in Palm Beach, Fl. I would like you to e-mail me and let me know when you are going to be in the area. If you are not going to be in the area soon I would like you to make a special trip to Palm Beach on me. We could have lunch. I would really appreciate it if you could e-mail me with a response as soon as possible. Ted"
2,This CD is very disappointing,"Oye huevones! If you liked the gutsy and catchy Control Machete with Fermin IV, then you probably will NOT like this CD. The writers now are obviously not as good as Fermin. There are no catchy tunes, the songs are monotonous and not interesting. Don't bother buying this!"
4,Brings back memories,"I bought this for my 9 yr old daughter. this one and ""Misty"" I can remember them from when I was her age. I think this will be some good summer reading for her."
5,"A great book about horses and storms, and my favorite book.","This is my favorite book! I think people who like horses and storms would like this book. It's the third in the series so if you like this book, you should also read Misty of Chincoteague and Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague."
3,Entertainment for Grandchildren,"This is an interesting story, mostly for smaller children. I must admit that I even enjoyed watching it. My granddaughter has a horse of her own and is particularly interested in horse or pony stories."
2,Cheap Quality,"I ordered several of the Henry books in hardcover. I was so disappointed!! The paper and print were substandard. I bought Nancy Drew books at Hastings that had the same binding but the paper quaility, thus the print, was far superior. Plus, the Henry books were more expensive then the Nancy Drew at Hastings!!"
4,High-energy punk rock,"I first heard of the Riverboat Gamblers from the Warped Tour 2006 compilation CD. As soon as I heard ""Don't Bury Me...I'm Still Not Dead"" I knew that I had to own the CD.""To The Confusion Of Our Enemies"" is full of punk rck with attitude, but on the other hand doesn't take itself too seriously. ""Don't Bury Me"" is a high-speed ballad, ""Biz Loves Sluts"" is a thinly-veiled poke at Hollywood, and tracks such as ""The Gamblers Try Their Hand At International Diplomacy"" and ""Unicorn Shave Your Horn"" are just the band messing around and having a good time.With a sound somewhere that punk and alternative rock lovers alike can appreciate, the ""To The Confusion Of Our Enemeies"" is a solid addition to any rocker's collection."
2,What happened?,"I've never written or stated anything negative about a record or band in my life... However, after listening to the gamblers latest and most anticipated album, I am pissed. I was completely let down. If you are a huge fan of ""Something to Crow About"" or the self titled (wich are both pretty f'in high on my list) stay away from this one. This album is way over produced and ""catchy"". There were a couple of bangers here and there but nothing that made me want to down a pint of Jim Beam and wrestle my fridge. I didn't even here a single YEAH! through out the whole album. I love the Gamblers, but this album just plain sucks."
1,Awful transfer,"Avoid this until a legitimate version is released. The English subtitled version is pan and scan from a dupey print with limited subtitles and grain the size of boulders. PLEASE save your money. The Italian only is a hair better in that it is anamorhic, but still a subpar picture (and no subtitles). Assume film is Public Domain for this is the worst DVD I've ever purchased....."
2,Major Disappointment,"I saw the last 20 minutes of this movie on TV several years ago and have been waiting for it to become available on DVD ever since. What a disappointment! As other reviewers have stated over and over, the quality is terrible. So why did I give it 2 stars instead of the lowest rating? First it is a great movie. Second, for reasons which I do not understand, the quality is good if you do not use subtitles. So if you understand Italian I can recommend it. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,"Good film, mediocre tape","Others have commented on the film's classic status so I won't repeat those comments here. Instead, I just want to warn potential purchasers of the video quality. The picture lacks resolution and colors are smeared with poor edge integrity (meaning the colors of objects smear into adjacent areas). The colors are also artificially intense. Overall, the copy quality is about on a par with that of real-time dubs using home VHS equipment. Given that we now live in a world of high quality [price]tapes from the major studios, the quality of this tape given its extremely high price is ludicrous. The rating is three stars: 4 for the movie and 2 for the tape copy (I have seen poorer quality tapes but at least the sellers charged a price consistent with the quality of the tapes).Note: For future readers, this review applies to the videotape copy of the film sold by Jef Films during the year 2001 ..."
1,Worst Quality,"Terrible quality. I cannot believe someone would have a nerve selling this. What a pity, because this is a great, great film."
1,This DVD is a joke!,"Simply and plain... this product is ""pirate"" quality and tell me about it, i'm from Mexico and I know about piracy.The box looks like a cheap color copy, the DVD just some black&white; letters (i.e. no CD cover) and that's it for $27 bucks (what I paid).I speak Italian and the quality of sound and picture is good, but for everyone else the english subtitled version has the worst picture & sound quality ever (not to mention the crappy subtitles ho ho ho)"
1,Marriage Italian Style Without Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroiani,"Unless you like wasting time and money and don't mind seeing a poorly transferred and equally poorly executed film starring Pia Lindstrom(?)and other none-actors, DO NOT GET THIS FILM! Search however long and hard you have to search in order to get the GREAT version of this film. No one can compare to Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroiani in either this film or any other film in which they worked together."
2,Is this Marriage ANAMORPHIC Italian Style?,"Although I haven't seen the Blu-ray of ""Marriage Italian Style"", the listing is already wrong or misleading. Unless something has changed while I was sleeping, there are NO Blu-ray discs that are ANAMORPHIC, as the listing claims. In one place it says that the aspect ratio is 1.77:1 and in another place it says it's 1.66:1. WHICH IS IT? As a projectionist I ran Marriage Italian Style when it came out in 1964 and my own recollection was that it was flat and hardmatted at 1.85:1. Since it was a long time ago I'll give them the benefit of the doubt (for ONE of the aspect ratios, however, WE ALL KNOW THAT IF IT'S BLU-RAY IT WON'T BE ANAMORPHIC. Maybe they can supply some accurate info BEFORE it comes out since they're taking preorders.As for the picture, anyone reading this knows that it was a great picture (unlike most of the junk made today -LOL)."
5,European Masterpiece,"Great Film. Great acting. Great choice of locations. Great standoff and realistic resolution of main characters which reflects back into the great acting with the personal and artistic chemistry between those two. Brilliant fluency, mixing of the comic and the tragic while the energy of the characters moves the film along as much as the timeline or story line."
1,EXCELLENT MOVIE IN A CHEAP REPRODUCTION,THIS MOVIE REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE A COPY OF THE COPY OF THE COPY OF THE COPY OF THE COPY OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION. HOW YOU AMAZON PEOPLE STILL LET THIS TO HAPPEN AND YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?????
4,Why isn't this on DVD?,It should be. Funny and sad. Sophia Loren always looks beautiful. Good movie. Enjoy!
1,marriage italian style,I ordered the english language version for my parents and they received the italian language version. I would appreciate it if Amazon.com would rectify the situation for myself and my parents.
1,Superb movie badly reproduced,"""Marriage, Italian Style"" is an excellent movie - the best ever made by Sophia Loren, I believe, but the quality of the reproduction on DVD is terrible. It's dubbed, and the video and audio quality are poor. Should not have made this purchase."
4,Great product; Works as expected,"Like product and had one for years that broke - due to my dropping it one too many times!Only rated it at 4 stars for a technical reason. When playing back on track 1 and 2, tone is much lower, like its decreased, for no apparent reason, but on tracks 3 and 4, where you would expect a decrease, it is quite normal.Other than that, I loved that it arrived with a set of headphones (mine were falling apart) and it also has an audio set of instructions (which I actually listened to) and it is very helpful."
2,The bag is Not the Bag pictured,Nice bag but I gave it 2 stars because it is not the bag shown in the picture.This bag does not have the drop down side pannier.Don't be mislead by the picture as I was!
5,"Caution! 2008 model is much smaller, and photo shows a different product!","The Amazon photo is of the MTX DXP, with built-in mini panniers. The DX does not have these panniers - the side pockets are indeed side pockets.Most of these reviews - and the photo - apply to the the Topeak MTX Trunk Bag DX from 2007 and earlier. The 2008 model is much different, and apparently much smaller (longer, wider, but lower).Old: 12.5""x6.5""x9~13"" 800 ci 1380 gmNew: 14.1""x9.4""x7.9"" 500 ci 845 gmI'm confused by the dimensions, but the new one looks smaller. It has a mesh pocket on top, and the bungee covers only half of the top. The side pockets look larger. They've eliminated the carrying handle. The main compartment is ""divided.""I could fit jeans+shirt in the old one. I'm not sure that's possible with the new one. Anyway, do some research to confirm what you're buying."
5,"Durable, Easy to use, High Value","I purchased this bag after seeing it in the bicycle dealer's showroom. The quality of the bag is impeccable, and the ease of use is even better. I highly recommend this product. I also used it with the E-type MTX rack, but it will work on any other MTX rack or tube type rack."
2,Never finished the book,"The book did not hold my attention.Some interesting bits though, and good for a person interested in deep research on this subject."
1,very bad ideas,"This is the first book by the author and he had management theories that were totally different from what you would hear at Stanford or Harvard business schools. Many years later he revised his theories to be significantly different and wrote a new book on his new, more universally accepted theories."
3,Not One of Her Best,"I always felt that Agatha Christie was not at her best when delving into the (for her, fantasy) world of spies, government secrets & espionage. When she does, the results seem more Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew. I really don't know why she did it because the results were like THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD.Christie does manage to squeeze by with her very practical knowledege learned from being on real archaeological digs in the Middle East with her second husband. She shows a real appreciation of the people, culture & daily life.If you are a dedicated Christie fan, you're probably going to want to read all her mysteries--including this one. If you're just curious about the Agatha Christie Phenomena, I'd pass on this one."
4,What a Sight it must have been!,"Mysteries usually keep you sitting on the edge, wondering who the guilty person is. In this case, I sat on the edge, wondering what I would find around the next corner in this magical and exotic place called Iraq. Reading this book, I actually forgot what horrors were going on in this enchanted land, and while I was mentally in that land, I found myself wanting to come back again, not just to meet the characters in ""They Came to Baghdad"", but to see the old hotels, the tea rooms, the Tigris as it flowed to meet the Euphrates. I no longer cared whether the main characters loved each other or simply wanted to take advantage of each other.If you like mysteries, I think you'll like this one. If not, I think you'll appreciate just being there in Baghdad prior to the horrors we see on nightly news. Either way, it's worth the small price of the book, or a trip to your library."
4,A good read if you like light mysteries.,"This is an interesting story, entertaining to read. It is mildly exciting. I enjoyed the somewhat flawed heroine and the setting."
4,PRETTY GOOD,"This is a pretty good book all the way around. The first part features Victoria, who, on chance meeting the man of her dreams, designs to follow him half-way around the world. Getting completely mixed up in danger, she determines to find out the truth. This, of course, means that everything she once thought was the truth turns completely around in a tangle of lies and deception. See if you can guess the antagonist...it's a classic Christie ending. It's really not too bad a book."
2,Very Superficial,"This DVD is just an ABC news report. It does not address the philosophy, motive, or what really happend. It is a news media release of an event, after the fact reporting-there is no investigation or background information on Heaven's Gate. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,satchmo on his game,This is a great cd mr armstrong is wonderful the sound quality is a little scratchy but it doesn't take away from the great music
5,Amazing chronicle of a little-known ethnic group,"I almost didn't buy this book because I hated the title. It still makes me cringe and I am an old lady years away from hearing it lobbed at my parents who spoke accented English. I don't know if everyone who reads this book, who is not of Rusnak heritage, would be as moved by the story as I was. But I think everyone would be moved by the overwhelming challenges faced by this unique group of immigrants. There is little understanding of the slavery of serfdom endured by them in their homeland for a thousand years; this book does an amazing job in sorting out the political mechanizations that kept the Rusnaks in poverty and ignorance. Karas' search for his family was so like my own journey to far Eastern Slovakia, even my meeting relatives with unusually bright blue eyes exactly like my mother's."
5,"Hunky, A book of the Immigration of the Carpathian Rus.","For me, this was a personal story and brought back family stories from the 'old country' before and after emigration. It pulled many things together that my grandmother and father talked about. It's astounding to me the changes that took place in that hundred years span. The families who are still living among the beautiful mountains between Slovakia and Poland, like those of us who came to America, are free to live as they wish."
3,"Unlike Billy, the novel fails to mature","Young Billy is green and fresh at the book's opening, and a seasoned young man by its end. Early in the book, you eagerly learn with Billy, through his neophyte eyes. But the book and Billy get bogged down in upstate New York, in a slow and sulky movement through time. I yearned for either a faster pace, or to learn more about Billy's inner workings, and felt that Doctorow didn't quite give me enough of either, as the book wore on. I say farewell to Doctorow for now, having liked Ragtime the best of his I've read."
3,A squeamish review,"I believe that I am just too squeamish for a book like this. The opening scene of the novel in which the narrator observes the gangster Dutch Schultz torture and torment to death his former close associate and friend, the gangster Bo Weinberg was just so vivid, so strong and so repulsive that it made it difficult for me to go on reading.There is so much real cruelty in the world , so much terrible pain that I cannot find any pleasure at all in reading about it 'fictionalized'.Doctorow's talents as a writer, his skill in creating riveting dialogue are not in question.But for me anyway the whole presentation of cruelty and torture is just not something I want to read."
2,"Billy Bathgate, paperback edition",The printing is so small that you need a magnifying glass to read this edition. Get the hard cover. The book is great!
4,great crime story from a different angle,Billy Bathgate sucks you into a world of a down and out street wise kid who is seduced by a low level seedy mobster into being his protoge. The writting is crisp and the story sharp. Very entertaining and probably Doctorows best work.
5,Short stories to take you to the distance.,"Peggy Simpson Curry writes a story you can sink your teeth into be it a short story or a novel. She said that seeing the Tetons for the first time was like being born again, reading one of her short stories is like learning to read again. She knows how to write fiction about human nature, the wide sweep of the Wyoming plains, the nuances and candence of the language of man, be he ranch hand or boss. Peggy Simpson Curry writes a mean story and we can all learn by her tales. Besides that the picture on the cover of the paper back book was taken on our property and includes our hayrake! :)"
3,On second thought,"I thought this book would be more detailed in scope than it was. In fact, I think the website http://www.russiantortoise.org/ is in some ways more informative than this book. I would still recommend purchasing it if you want to absorb as many viewpoints as you can. I feel the author was writing a primer, and not an extensive book on the subject of tortoises. This would be an excellent book for the newbie to tortoises, but for one who has cruised the internet on the tortoises, it may be a disappointment, but it is still worth owning."
3,Simplistic but suitable for small children,"This is the type of book that rightfully belongs in the children's section of the public library, and is laid out simple enough that even a kindergartener should have no major trouble with it.On the other hand, for a serious student of herpetology, this book will be too simplistic, and it should be noted that much of the information is no longer particularily accurate. And, I want to stress to novice toirtoise owners, due to the dated and less-than-accurate information, there are much better books on tortoise care available."
2,"VERY Basic, and Disappointing.","I got this book, and found its information very basic, and the book very short. You can find all the same information via google in about 15 minutes. It tends to repeat itself many times to try to reinforce the same points. Probably good for a child, but not worth buying for an adult looking to get into tortoise care. It also is not just about russian tortoises, but rather the 5 tortoises of the Mediterranean group. It glances over all of the, and then adds a little more for Russian tortoises, but its stil extremely lacking."
5,An insightful look into life in Berlin during WWII,"This book offers an insightful look into life in Berlin during WWII. It also offers a look at a lifestyle which no longer exists in Europe. This is an ""insiders"" look into life with the Nazis. While most of us are fully familiar with the Holocaust and its results for the Jews and other groups, this book gives us another perspective of Germany and Hitler and his Nazis. Additionally, we get a view of life among the royalty of Europe as it no longer exists. Interesting and thought provoking."
3,Good,This is a good book. Not like other diaries I've read. Had to hold your interest but it's a true diary.
1,Lousy Book,"Of many books I've read on this period, this one is the worst. It could be subtitled, ""How I ate and partied my way thru WWII"". Shallow reminiscences of a shallow aristocrat. I've never seen so much name dropping in one place. Only valid historical narrative is in the included editorial comments. The inferrence that the writer was involved in the July 44 plot to kill Hitler is a bunch of bull, she just casually met a few of those involved, having met them at one of her many many eating and partying affairs. Total waste of time and money."
5,a remarkable life livedin an equally remarkable setting,"I was not sure exactly whatI would be reading in this book. A close friend gave it to me. From the first page to the end I was captured by the brillant insights of the author. Most by her capacity to be unjudgemental of others and herself where it would be easy to do so. ( I found some of her friends empty-headed; others brave and honorable in the service of a corrupt state.)""Missis'"" own situations kept me asking myself could I have survived them and if so,could I be so objective? The book furnished me with a number of hard questions about objectivity in the service of one's survial"
2,Product Misrepresented,"I ordered this product for my son's 1995 Nissan 200sx. This item claimed ""nibbed"" backing and displays attachment grommet for the driver's side. The product I received was not nibbed (the backing was flat) and did not have driver's side attachment grommet installed. I ordered the set of four grey mats, color was closer to black/charcoal than grey (I expected something much closer to a medium or even a light or dark grey but not nearly black). I feel the product description was misrepresented. Quality of product seems good."
3,backstage politics aside,"this is a decent documentation of jesse, a dvd should be relased in 2 disc format. there is to much expolitive material, i mean this man was a govener he must b e doing soemthing right. he is a legend, to much classy blassie, with his bitter quotes but a good vhs, dvd should be out, id pay the 1.00 to buy this well worth it, its a great look back in some ways, i if u dont but this watch old wrestlmanias classic jesse"
1,"Nice in theory, lousy in practice!","This bag looks good, but that's about it. I used it for daily commuting and it collapsed within weeks. There is no inside frame so it cannot sustain any weight before it compresses. The bag then sags over the bag and almost touches the rear wheel. It is not waterproof and contents get wet even in light rain. If you are looking for a panier pack I would recommend going for the true thing and not this pretty wannabe."
3,Side Panniers a Problem,I've had this trunk bag for less than a yr and the side panniers are already falling apart. The seams were the fabric and the hard shell meet are separating on both sides. I really like the bag for the storage in the center section but something should be done to reinforce the side panniers.
5,Solid Midsize,"This is a great mid-size bag. Trunk is big enough for gear on a day trip and the zip out panniers are big enough to let me commute to school. I don't think I would take it on more than a 3 day trip without front panniers but it wasn't designed as a touring set up. For a commuter this is a great investment. Keep an eye on the weather report or buy the rain cover because it is only water resistant, not proof. For touring 3 stars, for commuting 5."
4,Good for this price point.,"I've used this, with the Topeak rack, since ordering it from Amazon in 2006. It is excellent for carrying my thermos and plenty of commute accessories. High wear points are along the bottom edges, where material is fatuiging. I'll probably get about 4 years worth of wear out of it, before needing to replace it due to wear and tear. The back loop is useful, but imperfect for holding a flasher, since it doesn't hold the flasher securely enough to avoid the flasher pointing down a bit too much. Side pocket hold useful amount of gear even when the panniers are folded in. Panniers are roomy and usefull when needed. Reflector striping is an added plus. The mount rail and carrying handle are very nice, to allow carrying valuable accessories into office or stores when my cycle is locked up outdoors. Removable design is also nice to take the bag into the bus with me, when it's rainy outside and my cycle is on the bus' bike rack."
5,EBike Rack Bag,"I ride a hybrid EBike and have battery bags sitting low on the side of the Topeak explorer rack and needed a MTX rack bag with a lot of cargo capability but not too large. This bag fits the bill! The panniers fold out and sit on top of the battery bags and hold a lot of stuff (lunch box, note book, laptop, etc.) with room to spare. The main compartment I use for tools, water, front and rear lights. This is the perfect bag for electic bikes.Topeak MTX Trunk Bag EX with Side Panniers"
4,Great Bag,Nice bag well made and in combination with the Topeak rear rack makes mounting and dismounting a breeze. The fold out panniers are nice when you need the extra space.
3,Tough to get on non-MTX racks,"The bag's pretty nice, overall... but I wish I had known what ""MTX rack compatible"" meant! What it really means is that the bag doesn't really fit all that well on non MTX racks. I have a Blackburn MTN rack, and the little quick release thing made this tough to actually get onto the rack! It's on though."
3,Looks MUCH bigger in the picture,Very nice looking but if you want more than just a single change of clothes consider something bigger. The DXP is a good bit bigger and only a few bucks more. I'm sending this one back and getting the DXP. The main compartment is suprisingly small and doesn't have a good place to put tools or a spare tube. There are two small pockets but they don't close so they are a poor choice. The MTX mount system is very nice though.
5,Excellent,I was first introduced to B.Kamins at HUMC Spa.. they have a rather high mark-up so i now shop them on amazon. The vegetable cleanser is amazing. Paired with the toner and SPF lotion your skin will look transformed.
5,Great when you don't have pockets.,"I don't like ""fanny packs"", ""bum bags"" or any of those lumbar packs that are used by hikers and tourists. I bought this little bag to hold my keys, wallet and cell phone when riding my motorcycle because my motorcycle clothing has very little to no effective storage space. Everything is tight and bulging items impede my range of motion. This fit the bill perfectly and the price was right."
5,Excelent product,"Jansport has always made great products. I had a back pack pack that lasted over 20 years. The only thing that failed was the zipper. I had a tailor sew in a new one and it was good to go. I like the the 2 pocket design of the waist pack. The clasp has a little bit more to be desired, but it works OK."
2,Not a very usefull item at all,"The belt on this item is small compared to others I have used and the clips are hard to fasten and cheap. You constantly have to re-adjust it as it always loosens up after a few days. The pouch itself is just fine, it's the belt and clip that make it a piece of junk. Look for another brand!"
5,Simply Perfect,"This is such a nice way to be able to go hands-free. You can put in a wallet, music player, keys (holds quite a bit) and then there's even an outside pocket in case you want fast access to cash or whatnot. Delicate, yet sturdy."
4,Good quality,We used in our trip overseas and found it practical. I wish it were less bulky. All in all a good product.
3,"Deffinetly not A +, more like a C -","I'll put it simple: nothing new. A few good tracks: Boyz to men, Watcha weigh me, maybe Understand the game. A lot of commercial beats...little dissapointing. Most songs are shallow. But, overall, not that bad."
3,Definitely not great,"I agree with the other that said the standout tracks on this album are: ""Boyz To Men (f/ Lost Boys & Canibus)""- Canibus spits the hardest verse on the album. ""Whatcha Weigh Me (f/ MJG)"". And my favorite track ""Staggerin & Stutterin (f/ Psychodrama)."
3,A+ sophomore album is straight!,"""Hempstead High"" has some tight tracks. If you're in the mood for some light, infectious beats to bob your head to this CD is a must buy. There's not much in the way of serious social commentary but, for his age, he's got some skillz! This album definitely let's you know where his head is at."
2,Maybe D+,"Biting lyrics from Puffy, trying to be jiggy when he should stay grimy, the atrosity of ""Enjoy Yourself"" but the decent ""Boyz 2 Men"". The trend of one million guest artists. I enjoyed ""The Latch Key Child"" but it was a Freshman Flop and here is a Sophomore Slump. America seems to be over the teenager rapping phase and we should be considering the only good seventeen year old rapper was Tupac(RIP). Once A+ gets his career together maybe he will be a superstar, until then this album is borderline awful."
4,pretty dope,this disk has a few good songs but there are also some crappy songs as well. but for how old he is this disk is pretty good. enjoy yourself is a great song and boyz 2 men is also dope.CYBERSK8
5,Wow,"Sad, beautiful, wonderful, wise, haunting, and totally relevant to our global issues of change. Destructive paths happen easily. Creative paths are contingent."
2,Bulky watch for a woman,"I purchased this watch for myself and it was much bulkier than it looked int the picture in real life. I like larger watches for myself but this was a bit much. Also, the date could not be set on the one I received so I returned it."
3,Very Basic,"My husband recently recieved this stat software and was not happy with the limited capabilities of this program offers. This program has the very basic stats. We have been looking around and have found programs that cost less with more stat capabilites. This does not alllow you to do shot charts or graphs and only allows for two extra stat categoies. If you just wan the basic stats this program is not bad. If you are a coach who like to do a little more with stats and charts, this is not the program for you."
3,daughter of the snows,"Long time since I have read Jack London. This was not a repeat for me, I never knew this work one existed until I saw it on the Kindle menu. I was expecting an exciting story that London is famous for, and I was disappointed. It's a good story, but not among his best in my opinion. A wealthy girl from a strong background takes on the harsh Klondike. I confess I skipped through much of it."
5,excellent,"These drapes are good quality yet affordable. Despite being a ""natural"" shade, they block out a lot of light (not sheer) yet still let a little light in for a pretty glow (so that the room is not dark and blah). They are ""sturdy"" and look classy. The tie-backs are interesting -- they come with a piece which you can install in the wall to pull them back, but you could also simply tie in the middle as shown in the picture above. You could also leave without a tie. Nice, basic drapes are hard to find and these ones are excellent -- highly recommend for pretty much any room."
4,Built great! I wish it held a bit more....,"This case is a great case. The pages are will made, and the cover and zipper are very solid. My only complaint is that this thing only holds 40 DVDs. It's a big case, so if you're expecting something the size of a 40 Cd case, then forget it. My kids like to see the DVD covers so I deal with the size.I'm looking to buy a few more, or maybe the next size up. I like the quality."
4,It Grew On Me,"I ordered this CD because it was a Cher CD I didn't own so I felt I needed to have it. Well When I got it I thought it was pretty boring , probbaly because I'm not really into songs like these. SO I kept listening to it and listening to it and now I really like it. I can't say it's my favorite Cher CD but this one is in a class of it's own , it grew on me."
2,Cher was not meant to sing these songs,"As much as I love cher I could not listen to most of this album. This is basicly a reissue of her early 70's album ""Bittersweet White Light"" (a collection of standards), and a few more added in. In my opinion I just did not think her voice is suited for these songs, or maybe it was the arrangments the I did not like. I would only recomend this to hard core fans."
4,These songs suit her voice!,"I always thought Cher's torchy readings of these songs were BETTER, stronger and more heartfelt than Judy Garland's bland little voice! Maybe it's being a child of the rock era, but I just can't relate to Garland or Streisand, too ""show tune-y"" for me! Cher rocks! I remember my favorite part of the Sonny & Cher show would be her solo number where she performed a lot of these ""jazz standards"" that are on this collection. She definitely has more range style-wise than most singers from the past or present. To think she can put these songs from the 30's & 40's across, do hard rock from the 60s, 70s - - new wave from the 80's and techno from the late 90's proves she a stylist to reckon with! VIVA CHER!"
2,"Bombastic excess, but interesting.","Sonny's production on the selections from ""Bittersweet White Light"" are so over the top as to render some of these songs unlistenable. Cher's voice, however, is always interesting and you've got to give her points for courage in doing these classic songs. A nice CD for collectors but not one you'll play again and again. By the way, where is ""3614 Jackson Highway"" on CD? It's still my favorite Cher album!"
2,The songs that got away.,"Cher is one of the great pop voices of the past four decades, but there were many career lows along the way, and this was one of them. She struggles valiantly through some of the most overblown arrangements of standards ever put down on vinyl, as if a great voice simply singing great songs wouldn't have been enough. The splendid ""Way of Love"" is tacked on to the end, but it's too little too late. (There's a classic typo in the new liner notes, too - ""It's worth noting..."" somehow became ""It's worth nothing..."", and that pretty well sums it up.)"
4,"Sick Fly looks it, but contains a range of Wantling's work.","With its bilious yellow and blue cover, and illustratons featuring a mushroom cloud and an undeniably dyspepsic-looking William Wantling, Sick Fly is one of the most off-putting looking books I've ever encountered. Inside, however, are some of the best and worst poems of William Wantling's all-too-short career. ""[W]e found the park all right,"" ""It was Tuesday Morning,"" and ""Once you've been a dopefiend"" are grim, brutal, even often vulgar--yet hauntingly powerful glimpses into the poet's tortured soul and his life. Less successful are works such as ""Hymn,"" and ""Antiphon."" Written during the poet's years at San Quentin, they derive, it appears, from too much Swinburne consumed too quickly and digested too little. Still, there is no such thing as TRULY bad Wantling, and those interested in what was happening at the fringes of what was left of the Beats around 1970 could certainly do worse than search out this book.--Kevin Jones"
5,Tip Top Router Plate,"Installation in the table top was straight forward and the fit is limited only by the accuracy of the template used. Mounting the router is just about as easy as it can get. The instructions that come with the plate tell you all you need to know, however, the old rule of measure twice and cut once applies here also. Take your time, double check your points before drilling the mounting holes and you just can't go wrong. The two furnished inserts give all the clearance options the average user will need. Amazon delivery also was right on the money."
4,Router Mounting Plate,Good for the plate for the money no problems. If I had to do over I would spend a few bucks more and get an aluminum plate.
5,Nice router table insert,"Been using this router table insert for several years and would recommend it. Nice and flat, also easy to use the throat inserts."
2,Not recommended.,"The plate was not flat as delivered. It was warped to opposite corners. The spanner wrench for changing the inserts is extremely difficult to remove from the insert.Overall, I will not buy another."
3,He even says it is only a theory...,I wanted to read Darwins words myself and it is quite an undertaking as this is a long book. I found his words interesting as he quite clearly states this is only a theory...
3,Just gets more absurd with time.,"Well written but obviously biased. Mr. Darwin researches eagerly, ignoring truth, embracing his main thesis of evolution by natural selection. Modern day ""scientists"" poo poo this volume while doing the same."
2,"A dry, boring writing style","I'm sure this is a very good book...Goodness knows I've wanted to read it for a long timeand finally here it is -on my Kindle!Must confess I never got through it all -in fact far from it.The writing style is so incredibly long-winded and Flowery Victorianthat I had real trouble getting to the essence of what was being said!Obviously, it's my problem, not Darwin's -I realize thatand I simply gave up after a chapter or twobut if you are a serious student of biology and evolution,and an avid reader who can plough through the best of themthen this may be a book for you.I just had Attention Deficit trouble with it, sorry!"
1,absolute foolery,ha! science? his arguments are EASILY refutable. he kills himself with his promises. ex. complexity of cell and missing link (lucy is a fraud) so if your looking for a good fantasy look no further. enjoy.
3,Orginial book,This book is ok but I haven't read it all the way through. Seems accurate to hard copies or published books.
3,Good eBook missing diagrams,I am enjoying this book but several passages make reference to a diagram that does not appear to exist within the ebook.
1,title error,"Hilarious! The title of this book is incorrect! The correct title phrase is ""Origin of Species"" not ""the Species."" What a blunder!"
1,This version is a forgery,"As the sub-title to this ""Special"" ""On the Origin of Species"" version attests, it seems some of the christian persuasion have gone and done it again. This time taking a classic text and altering it to fit their agenda. This particular version adds little lies and deceptions I'm sure the Darwin family takes issue with. I expect no less of the ignorant to defame and use lies and deceptions to keep their true religious views from being known, but it's hard to believe Amazon would allow this forgery to be displayed and distributed as a book by Darwin. The Darwin family has been notified just in case they were not informed by Amazon that they are promoting this thing. Please download or obtain the real ""On the Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin. Not this christian version."
2,Errors.,"So many errors. I highly recommend the reading of this book, but not the Kindle version. Purchase his actual book."
2,good book,everybody should already be very familiar with the focus of this book. It is an excellent read if you are into science
4,Good,Can't say much as y have lend my Kindle and could not read the book. But looks just fine. Thank you.
2,"Yes, it is Frank Sinatra, but....","I'm not a professional critic, and I've never written a review before, but I'm fairly familiar with Frank Sinatra's work and all I can say for sure is he is definitely singing on this boxed set. The quality is not terrible, but it is far from great. Most of us are familiar with enhanced monophonic sound and this isn't it. Some of the cuts sound as though Mr. Sinatra is very very young, and then on other cuts, not so young. The box says ""made in Portugal"", and I couldn't find much info on the label, nor could I run down a time line by using research on the web. All in all, if you like Frank Sinatra, buy a different boxed set than this one. If you THINK you have everything Mr. Sinatra has ever recorded, you need to look at this set."
2,Made my son cry,This book made my four year old son very sad. He decided when HE grows up he'll be a fire-fighter and get a historical firetruck and NEVER replace the nice horse with an engine.
5,"Bristles are just right - not to stiff, not too soft","I bought this to replace my old face brush (by Origins) whose bristles were too stiff. With my old face brush, after I used it, my moisturizer would sting my face, which told me that the old brush was putting little tiny cuts all over my face. This brush by Happy Face is just perfect. It's much softer than my old brush and my face feels good afterward. At the same time it's not so soft that it doesn't feel like it's not doing anything. My face feels so much cleaner than washing with just my hands or a wash cloth!"
1,Cheap,"One star may seem like a harsh review for this product, but it really is rather cheap. I have some other brushes at home, and they're very soft, almost velvety, but were getting a little too old for my liking. I decided to order this because of the price and the reviews, but the thistles (if that's what they're called) are very plastic-y to me. I'm afraid that using this brush would just cause more tiny, microscopic cuts on my face that would open up my skin and make it vulnerable to even more bacteria. The brush is made in China and looks like something I could have bought at an Asian market for $2. I won't be returning it, since they don't cover shipping for non-defected items. Not recommended :("
3,Mold,"I kept mine in the shower, and it grew mold. Be sure to let it air dry to prevent this. Maybe it could be made to resist mold as well."
2,A little rough,"I bought this brush to save money. I have oily skin that feels dry despite it. I used to buy Shiseido facial brushes along with their products but find them too expensive nowadays. I was hoping this would work similarly but it doesn't. The Shiseido brush was extremely gently with a very fine comb. It was impossibly to feel the brush go into the pores, I just felt the foam gently washing my face but it would leave my pores perfectly clean. This brush feel a little rough, the bristles are less dense and doesn't clean as well so the search continues."
2,Broke in half in less than 2 weeks,Pleased with results but part with bristles broke in half after less than 2 weeks use. I will not take a chance and buy this product again.
4,Nice brush,The brush is very soft. If you want it to exfoliate it will not. It has very nice bristles and is very comfortable in your hand but a bit too soft for me. I like to scrub my face.
2,facial brush,I have used this type of brush for years it was fine soft brissels but with in 30 days the brissels were all matted down and is very close to useless at this point.
5,Great for sensitive skin!,I just got the brush today and as soon as I used it I saw a major difference in my complexion my face was glowing and my skin tone looked even! Amazing. Definitely a great purchase. Also it came on time (:
4,slow-paced enjoyment for people who enjoy reading,"Most biography is history, and Emerson: The Mind on Firs is no exception. The reader learns more about a segment of mid-eighteenth century New England society and the people around Emerson than about Emerson. Margaret Fuller, Aunt Mary, even Henry Therou are as much a part of this book as Emerson.Enjoy, too, the lists of books mentioned, and the notable people he met. Ideas and issues of the day come into view as a natural process in reading about these lives. I learned more about transcendentalism and understood it better from this book than I did from a college course devoted to the subject. I also saw the civil war from a different perspective--if you can believe that from the masses of print on the subject.The book seems to move in small, slow steps -- 100 short chapters might explain that -- and may be a good book for the nightstand for a tranquil moment of thoughtful repose before sleep."
4,"Wonderful product, no longer exists.","I was surprised to find Amazon listing this grand old product. CIC vanished years ago, this product is no longer available. More's the shame. There's no real substitute, you can try TextPlus if you dare."
4,CLASSIC DOCTORS BAG,"I THOUGHT THE COLOR WAS BROWN, BUT I RECEIVED THE BAG IN BLACK AND STILL REALLY ENJOY THIS BAG. HAPPY!!!!"
5,Perfect hide away,"I bought this bag to carry my toys on trips. It is great quality, look and feel and you can hide anything in plain sight with this bag."
2,OK fluff,"This was a somewhat entertaining read. However I couldn't really get into it because I was unable to suspend my disbelief while I read the story. *spoiler*For example, the mob was portrayed as being brutal, but rather stupid. Like why wasn't someone tailing Abby when she went to find the Boss's wife? If they really wanted Abby's cooperation, all they had to do was threaten Abby's sister.Then the FBI assigns Dutch on a sting operation against a mob family that is based out of the same city where Dutch was a police officer. Oh what brilliance! Like the FBI hasn't heard of a mob family having police officers on the take...Also, the way Abby orchestrated the conclusion was way over the top, and it should have resulted in the mob killing her the next day."
4,On my repeat author list,This was a fun quick read. Really appreciated that I wasn't roped unexpectedly into a romance novel.
4,love this author,"this book was not as good as book 1 but i love the main character and this author! i felt like the whole greek mafia thing was a little much but the books are entertaining and being a psychic junkie myself, i find them very interesting."
3,"Good book, but...","Although I enjoy this series and will probably continue to buy the books, I can't help thinking that Abby is incredibly immature. The whole scene with Dutch's new partner was straight out of junior high. And this continues into the next books. As soon as someone tells Abby not to do something, she goes out and does it just to spite them, even if it means putting herself in danger. At 30 something, I would think she'd be a little more grown up. Also, Cat is just plain annoying.I'm sorry. I hate to disparage anything, but I would enjoy this series a great deal more if Abby could mature a little."
5,great!,I am going to make this short and sweet. I loved this book! I could not put it down and absolutely had to finish it this morning before work. Read it!!
4,"Good, but irritating in places!","Based on his encounters with the brilliant but doomed poet Delmore Schwartz, Humbold's Gift is like much of Saul Bellow's novels in that it's well-written and flows nicely. However, what makes it different from earlier works like ""The Adventures of Augie March"" is that the narrator is such a drip - a man who squanders his good fortune on bad gambling tips and dubious concubines. Bellow's characterization of the narrator Charlie Citrine is almost too convincing. Citrine becomes absolutely insufferable at times, and this makes sometimes it difficult to continue reading without wanting to slam the book down in disgust instead of reading on.However, for those with a penchant for flawed personalities - and for fans of Delmore Schwartz, there is much here to entertain."
3,A Delicate Weave of Exposition and Storytelling,"Charles Citrine's fascination with death (although not his) seemed to pre-occupy him to the point where he was unable to understand his own living. If this is part of the main theme, Bellow succeeded in crafting ingenius moments of narrative that enlightened the reader and developed an unpredictable (somewhat meandering) plot. To many readers, this book will come off as very showy- an exercise in exhibiting how well read and studied Bellow is. In this book, if the narratives are Bellow's strength, the dialogue is his weakness. It seemed to suffer from the same malaise as the ending- it was too compact and forced - especially for a book focusing on someone that is desperately searching to lift the weight of the dead off of his shoulders. Nothing in real life (or death) is as tidy as the ending of this book."
2,"holding the mirror, as 'twere, up to Nature...","This is my first attempt at reading Bellow and I was distinctly underwhelmed at his writing style. It would be nice to round up all our contemporary novelists, sit them in a lecture hall, and explain to them in no uncertain terms that it takes more than Realism and Stream of Consciousness to make a good novel. In Bellow's case, he overdid both techniques."
1,cries out to be taught in a classroom,"I loved Bellow's two short novels, Dangling Man and Seize the Day; tightly packed, concentrated thrilling accounts of alienation. But while Humboldt's Gift begins as well, it quickly tapers off into a diffuse mass of self-indulgent, theory- dropping nonsense. I think Jame's Atlas's comment in the brand new bio of Bellow is very apt here, that Bellows, like many people from an impoverished, immigrant background, is trying too hard here to make up for the deficiencies of his youth. Detached readers have a legitimate complaint about Bellow's penchant for self-indulgence, which repeatedly pads a potentially excellent 200-pager into 300-plus page behemoth of tedium and name-dropping. A real shame, because Dangling Man and Seize the Day are American classics. The uncommitted reader may wish to start with those."
2,Where's the Beef?,"Having read Mr. Sammler's Planet, I had high hopes for this novel.I pictured something loaded with insight and jewels of descriptions on every page. This book has scant few of these things and lots of name dropping, rambling unconvincing philosophy, and boring characters...(Where are all the wonderful characters in Sammler's Planet?).In short it is a dud and long. I especially liked the commentator who said realism and stream of thought do not automatically produce a good novel.Where's the beef?"
3,Pretty good,"I'm not up to the long discussion this book deserves but will say that for every element of it that is sublime and breathtakingly novel, there are corresponding parts that are tedious and self-conscious. The story, as it were, has more or less been completely told by page 200."
1,One of the biggest over-rated bores in 20th c. American lit,"A warning to anyone thinking of buying this book: stiftle the urge, borrow it from a library, if you must. I agree with three out of seven reviewers here who have panned the book. This deserves the word ""bloviated,"" if it exists. Having spent some time this year reading some ""classics"" of 20th c. American lit, I can say this is the worst. A huge bore."
2,A brainy moron,"Charles Citrine is an author. The man isn't stupid. Yet, like other leading characters in Saul Bellow's books, he lives his life in a foolish way. He has the kind of friends who eliminate the need for enemies. If he had a dog it would bite him daily, and he'd feed it.The title character, Humboldt, is another writer, suffering from manic depression at a time when lithium wasn't widely prescribed. His gift to Citrine is a manuscript, and is left to Citrine after Humboldt's death. The manuscript turns out to be valuable, but I doubt that it will straighten out Citrine's life. He can be counted on to insure himself a complicated and unsatisfying life. It's frustrating to read about this intelligent dope."
2,Decepcionante Linea Naranja,"Saludos! al recibir este dvd no pude evitar sentirme decepcionado, pues no incluye todos los videos que vienen en la version ""original"" del mismo, incluso viene en una caja mas delgada (muy similar a la de los DVDS PIRATAS), supongo que para ahorrar papel o algo, a continuación escribo el tracklist del mismo, donde se daran cuenta de los videos que no incluyeron:ENTRA EN MI VIDAMIENTES TAN BIENQUE LLOROMAGIASUELTA MI MANOSERAAl parecer la famosa ""Linea naranja"" de Sony lo que hace es volver a reditar contenidos pero no respeta su formato original, sino que les hace mutilaciones que lo unico que logra es la decepcion del comprador"
3,head band,its very good a strong head band thick metal and it silk very big bandana size so its good to fit almost every one
3,Naruto Leaf Village Bandana,"Awesome Naruto bandana. Bandana looks great. However its made of synthetic (nylon, or rayon) materials. It's ok for fun wear, but not if you are going to work out or sweat in it. Cotton is better.Too bad metal plate is not removable for machine washing. Hand wash only, and then towel dry the metal plate so it wont rust.Hand wash it in Woolite, because of the metal band, and then dry the metal headband.Adult sized bandana."
5,Happy to hear,"I like to listen The Knight Brothers CD ""Temptation"" a lot, that is only chance to listen most of their songs. I am happy to hear the deep, beautiful baritone of song writer and performer James Leon Diggs and tenor of Richard Dunbar complimenting it so nicely. They both are still performing, so, I hope there would be some chance for them get together again, even if Diggs lives in Los Angeles, but Dunbar in So Carolina..."
1,Bad!,"This product looks great on the desk and has a great price compared to the other models. I work for a mid-size corporation and we had purchased two of these for two offices. Within one month both of them started to flicker and fade to red. We had both replaced (easy to get them replaced, that's one good thing) and all seemed fine until another two months down the line when one of the replacements started to do the same thing. Just a fair warning!"
4,Excellent monitor,"Excellent monitor, great picture and clarity for the price. Easy to install, just make sure that your graphics card is compatible with it to get the best value from the monitor."
1,Monitor,"Contacted ANTonline 3 days after receiving this product because the monitor was the wrong type for my security project. Contacted ANTonline to return item but was told we had to go online to obtain a RMA number. This number gives the authorization and address to make the return. After several emails to this company, we were told the product could not be returned. Again, we contacted them stating that the product was never used. This time we were told that the return information would be sent within 48 hours (5 March 2008). We have contacted this company over 8 times requesting the return address but no one is responding. It has been over 30 days and I have contacted the Better Business Bureau for assistance."
1,"Looks Great, Doesn't Work","I bought the coffeemaker thinking that it would be a decent product for the price. It looks good and it has a nice feature set but beyond its aesthetics and functionality this thing is very cheap!The main issues I experienced were as follows:1) It leaked. And I don't mean a little dribble here and there; it created puddles. See the other reviews.2) Within less than a year it started to randomly stop during the brew process, almost as if it thought it was done. The unit almost became completely useless.3) The coffee maker tainted the coffee with the great taste of plastic. As a person that really likes a good cup of coffee, this might have been the worst offense. Of course a coffeemaker should at least work.4) The amount of steam that escaped seemed unusual. The finished brew was always short by about a cup or two.5) The heating plate worked but didn't keep the coffee hot."
1,Sad But True,"In a recent video (At Home With Paul Beryl), the author admits that he didn't know as much about herbalism in 1984 that he apparently wishes he had known. I admire the honesty but would feel disappointed if I had this 1984 edition. Don't buy this. Get his newer one.As for the quality of his books in general, they totally rock. He really is considered the best of the best when it comes to books herbalism. Just don't buy his video. It's really has very little usable information."
1,Missed the mark on the herbs.,"Aesthetically, I enjoy this book. But from an herbalist's perspective, the quality of information is really poor. It was disappointing, I really wanted it to be good. It seems like a hobbyist's book of herbalism. Which is not to denigrate it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the medicinal use of herbs.I personally thing the magical correspondences can be helpful for someone who practices this work. As far as herbal medicine, best look elsewhere."
5,Classical music lovers and LP lovers must have.,"This book is a must have for people who love classical music. Many of the best classical performances will never be transferred to CD, and LPs sound better anyway. This guide has an extensive list of catalog numbers, which will help you determine the recording dates of your records."
4,Missing Two Important Tracks,"""Whisper You Love Me Boy"" and ""Standing at the Crossroads of Love"", two important tracks from their early (pre ""Diana Ross and"") period are not included in this collection. Just so you'll know."
4,Looks good,Looks good so far. We will see how long it lasts. A little difficult to apply since it tends to stick to the sheet that needs to be removed. Use a sharp point to help it along.
5,great decal and great service~!!,The decal comes in various sizes- make sure you let them know the size you would like- GREAT decal and great customer service!!
2,Sci-Fi TV,"I bought this book for a ""history of sci-fi television"" class and had to read pretty much the entire book throughout the term. The book has a lot of information and the author definitely has a grasp on the subject but the way the book is written is very ""meh"". Most chapters simply consist of the author recounting or summarizing plots from various tv episodes with little else in the way of info. If you are looking for a book that is more history and behind the scenes oriented about sci-fi then pass on this. If you want a book that quickly spoils the plot of every sci-fi series but accurately summarizes entire seasons in a few chapters then this is your best bet.Also whatever typeface they used for the body copy of this book is horrendous. In combination of a wacky font and much too tight of leading you will quickly find your eyes strained and overwhelmed. Poorly designed interior. Decent looking dust jacket. 2/5 for book design as well."
4,a classic in Southeast Asian anthropology,"Although this book is somewhat out of date (first published in 1965), it continues to be a good general introduction for students of Southeast Asian societies. There are two major drawbacks in my opinion -- first, as I said, the book is out of date since the many years of warfare in the region have had a profound effects on the peoples in this region. Second, the author devotes only one chapter to the numerous hill tribes. The book is geared toward state-level societies in the lowlands. At any rate, the reader will come away with a good general understanding of state-level societies in mainland Southeast Asia. It's a good starting point for further study."
5,Smooth Transaction,"I ordered this book for a college class. It was delivered in an expedited manner and was in great condition. Thank you for offering a great deal, I could not have found a better price at the bookstore!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"On the one hand, this book addresses a lot of important issues that are overlooked by other history books. However, it is a book that discusses issues in history, not events in history, which I don't think is ideal for an introduction or overview. There is very little context for the beginner to Middle-Eastern history, and very little is learned about the who-what-where-when, although you'll get plenty of ""why.""I was dissapointed because I was mislead by the table of contents into thinking it was a book that talked about what happened, not just theory behind what happened. So, let this be a caution to you who are looking for actual history. You're better off reading the ""area handbook series country studies"" either about individual countries, or groups such as ""persian gulf countries,"" which have much actual event history."
3,Ok product,"Very nice on the counter. The only thing I wouldn't agree with is that the sealing of the glass lids to the containers is not tight. you can almost slide them right off. No big deal for me, because we go through the things we put in there quickly. But for someone looking to keep something fresh for a long time, it's not a good purchase."
3,Square Glass Canisters,"Previous reviews indicated these canisters don't seal well around the top, but I have some individual ones purchased locally that seal real well, so thought I would give these a try. The reviews are correct, they do not seal well around the top. You have to be careful and pick them up below the top,or the top will come off in your hand and whatever is in the bottom portion may be spilled. They are attractive and don't take up much room-good for small apartment or a single person for flour, sugar, etc, but not for someone that does a lot of baking to use for that purpose. Would be ok to store packets, such as tea bags or candy bars or food products like rice or beans that you would use up quickly-not for longer storage."
5,Tremendous Addition,"This is a tremendous addition to a little studied area of Civil War military science - supply and movement of the wherewithal. A 1990 find still bound in government 'red tape', these records provided rich background on the incredible paperwork and labor needed to supply the hay, grain, horses and mules, ordinance, hospitals, quarters, and the myriad other items needed by a fighting force. We tend not to comprehend the millions of pounds of grain and hay required for just one campaign, for example, nor do we think of the civilian clerks, laborers, teamsters, and others that helped carry out the quartermaster function. This activity was replicated wherever Union soldiers served. All this plus fascinating background on the 23-year-old Captain Simon Perkins, Quartermaster in the Western Theater."
4,Buy correct version!!,"Be aware that there are (probably) 2 versions available: One with 6 tracks and the other with 12. I believe that the ""Linea Naranja Series"" is the shorter version. The more expensive copies would probably be the full length DVD. Rather confirm with the seller beforehand. Otherwise a very enjoyable 1984 concert of MOCEDADES."
3,High quality except for mirror mount,"This wall mirror is built well, but the rod that screws into the mirror does not extend very far and looks like it will be a problem to keep tight. The instruction manual says to tighten a collar nut with pliers, but it is similar to another mirror my wife had that started getting loose within a short period of time. The extension bars do allow a wide adjustment away from the wall, making it easy to get it positioned just so."
2,"Jerdon First Class 4X Wall Mount Mirror, Chrome","I was pleased at the looks of the mirror. but when I opened the accordin arm it would not stay in place and swung freely. I have used this type of mirrors for many years, so was dissappointed that I could not use this mirror for the purpose that it was made."
4,for serious fans/collectors only,"Just to make it clear to those who do not know, this set does not contain the original mixes of some of the Supremes' biggest hits. While the inclusion of alternate mixes is great for those of us (myself included) who already have these songs elsewhere, this set might disappoint a more casual fan hoping to get all of the hit singles in one place. I would direct such a person to the excellent 2-disc ""Anthology"" (the reissued version released in the mid-90's).A rarity I would have liked to have seen/heard included here is the disco remix/medley of some of the Supremes biggest 60's hits. To my knowledge, that has yet to appear on cd.Edit from October 2005:For those who may be unaware of it and reading this review, the disco medley has finally been issued on cd. It is one of the tracks on the second disc of extended mixes available on the ""deluxe edition"" of Diana Ross' ""Diana"" album."
5,"still waiting, buy it!!!!","i was unsure about buying another box set, but i did boy was i pleased that i did. i have been a fan since i was 14 years old now thats over 25 years, but this box-set was well worth that wait, its allmost what you want but stil leaves you looking for more. great recordings, great singing, the whole box-set is put together very well, well worth the money."
4,"love the selection, hate the box","I have ton of greatest hit albums, but this particular box set has more than what most people remember about the supremes there were some songs that were live from concerts but, really what is the real treat is disc 4. The last disc contains the songs from the supremes after diana. Really this is why I bought the box set, you get to see that the supremes were about more than diana and that as times change, they went from a lead singer and 2 ooh ahh girls, to being 3 singers. My new favorite supremes song has to be the closing song and one of the last of the supremes "" You are the Heart of Me"" lead vocals by Mary Wilson. Overall a good set decent sound quality."
4,great costume,"It lives up to it's name :), and the Internet department store delivered quickly. The costume itself shipped very well. The costume fits comfortably. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to have a good evening with comfort and style."
2,Students Perspective,"Hey, I am not a math person... And this book was really confusing.. Filled to the brim with problems to work out, it leaves little room for explanation! If you have this book. You'd better hope that you have a good professor!"
1,Yikes,Imagine having to cover this nightmare of a book in three weekends spread over six weeks. Can't really say that I know anything more about Sadistics now than when I started.
3,Good,"I really like ""The Masters"" but found it difficult to get into the others. Maybe it was just an off day. I'll try again later."
2,Do you like to eat glue?,"Yes, yes the plates are very nice. But some idiot glued the price sticker on the front of the all the plates instead of the back. The adhesive used on these stickers must be crazy glue. I had to soak the plates for a week before I could remove that adhesive. So don't expect to eat with these plates unless you like eating ink, paper, and glue. Good Luck."
3,great until they chip and break,"We have... had 16 of these plates, had to reorder twice because so many were broken. The sticker is indeed glued with amazing glue to the front of the plates, but a scrub with baking soda took it right off. Goo gone should also work, but I was out. Anyway, they are heavy and look nice, and are our dinner plates (they're huge) but over half have chipped edges, and two have broken straight down the middle for seemingly no reason. If you want these, get extras."
5,Sheep to Sheer Pleasure,"A non-knitter, I find this book a continuous pleasure. Macdonald's humor and serious interest knit well together. She looks at different aspects of women's work during peace and war. Men and boys who knit are discussed too, but the emphasis is on women knitting."
3,Interesting mix of covers,"This 2CD set is in honor of Elektra Records' 40th anniversary. Current Elektra artists cover the songs from the entire Elektra catalog.The songs are a bit of everything, and so there is not much cohesion; more like a smorgasborg. Some of the highlights are ""One Meatball"" by Shinehead, ""Hello I Am Your Heart"" by Sara Hickman, ""These Days"" by 10,000 Maniacs, and a mezmerizing ""Going Going Gone"" by Bill Frisell, Robin Holcomb and Wayne Horvitz. And don't miss the singular version of Hotel California by the Gypsy Kings!!Interesting tidbit - the Cure both cover a song and are covered!"
1,BAD SOUND,"STAY WITH MOTOWN'S BOX SET HITSVILLE EARLY YEARS. YOU GET SAME SONGS AND MANY MORE PLUS PERFECT SOUND FROM THE ORIGINAL MASTERTAPES. NICE SELECTION HERE, BUT IT IS MYSTIFYING WHY THEY DIDN'TUSE HITSVILLE'S TRACKS. SO STAY AWAY AND SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE BOX SETFOR A PURE MOTOWN SOUND YOU NEVER HEARD BEFORE."
3,but...,"...go see the movie Standing in the Shadows of Motown or buy the soundtrack CD and discover that they key to these hits was the consistent session musicians who played all that genius stuff.From the way the record producers and marketing folk of the time behaved, you'd never even know they existed.wg(forget the stars, i hate starred rankings)"
5,Power of youth...,"The author tells a good story that would have a more political bent to it if scripted today...A boy travels through a childhood that was replaced by a continent... Africa and faithful islamis help him survive and learn and grow...The boy suffers deep physical,spiritual and mental wounds that would make an interesting story of its' own of a young man of his experiences..."
3,Not bad for a first taste of Portuguese,"For such a small book with only 95 pages, this course gives you a good start. I liked the way it involves the learner, with a progress chart. The flash cards help too. It is fun and stimulating, with a certificate at the end. It is all very communicative but it gives you quite a bit of grammar that helps you understand and make your own sentences. This is on the good side, but there are some typos and this is annoying. The Portuguese word for tennis is spelt sometimes with an acute accent, others with a circumflex accent. I am told that one is the European spelling, the other the Brazilian spelling. Perhaps it does not matter, it is only an accent."
1,Shiphandling for the Mariner,"The book edition was not specified on the internet page presentation. So I've got the third edition, wich is not usefull for me, while I did need the fourth edition. I've spent U$74 and yet I don't have the correct book."
1,Definitely Not worth buying,"Cover was way too big for pool, so hangs on ground and does not fit tight."
1,Flimsy cover,The cover is very difficult to put on by one person. It is also very flimsy; doesn't cover pool well. I give this cover a very poor rating. In all it does keep the leaves and dirt out of the pool. I wouldn't recommend this cover for this size pool.
2,How do you keep it clean?,"So, we bought this pool for our 1 year-old son. On Day 1, the water was too cold from the hose, so he didn't want to be in it. On Day 2, the bottom was slimey, and he fell down, so he didn't want to be in it.How do you keep this pool clean? We bought the cover - more or less useless, to be perfectly honest.If you want to fill the pool every time you're going to use it, great. Me? Not so much..."
1,Not worth the hassle!,"Purchased this pool cover for my oversized kiddie pool. This cover is such a hassle for 1 person, I find myself circling the pool constantly adjusting each corner over and over again. If it's a windy day it will take longer to put on properly. The string that you tie around the bottom of the cover loosens after a while and the cover sags and pulls away from the sides. For some reason I was expecting a cover that is similar to a shower cap, something with elastic on the bottom that I could easily pull over the pool and it would stay. I'm not able to pull the cover as tight as you see in the picture. I don't think it's worth the hassle."
3,3 has sounded better,"when i first herd 3 i was in amazment, i first herd the albome wake pig and was extremly excited to see what else they had to offer. i bought all of there albumes, (wake pig, paint by number, half life, summercamp nightmare) and my least favoret is paint by number but next up is summercamp nightmare. the lryics are stil alittle ruff and slightly emo on this albome. they seem to still searching for the sound that they reached on wake pig. the guitar is softer and not as actaive, if you are interested in older 3, i would recamend half life, an acustic performance and also had a varity of songs from thier first 2 records. but over all, if you are a deadicated 3 fan, get this. but if not get wake pig."
3,"nice dress belt but not for everyday wear, too thin",Belts were ok...not as thick as implied in photos. Would be a nice occaisional travel bet but not fro everyday use which is what we were looking for
3,Not worth the money,"I bought this belt for a trip to Asia, luckily it was a short trip. The belt does its job holding cash but I feel the belts quality is poor for the money. It has single line of stitching on one edge of the belt only that does not hold up and just feels cheap in the hand. I would not buy another."
3,Well made but CAUTION! Conditional rating (see below),If you enjoy changing belt buckles as I do be aware that these buckles are not able to be changed. For me it is a deal killer and I returned the item. If you are happy with one buckle I give is 5 stars.
3,Useful but not great.,"The problem I have with this belt, which I still use occasionally, is the tendency to warp. The belt looks like it was poorly manufactured after just a few weeks of use. I know it's because of the thin area around the internal pocket, but it looks bad and I don't wear it unless it's necessary."
2,Money Belt,My husband asked me to return the money belt. He did not like having to roll the money. Company handled the return in a quick and expedient manner. Thanks.
1,Overly complicated,I was assigned this book for a college course. I found this book hard to understand and overly complicated. No one in my class liked this book. We also told the teacher that we didn't really learn anything from this book. We learned when he would go over the chapters and explain them to us. I understand this book wasn't ment for an exciting read but was it ment to be extremely hard to get through as it was? Thankfully for his next class; he will be finding an alternative book.
1,one of the worst literary purchases i have ever made!,"having,for the past 30 or so years, read between 40 and 50 books annually, i can practically count on the fingers of one hand those books i have ""just not been able to get through"" (ishiguro's pretentiously incomprehensible ""unconsoled"" was my last failure in this area.) by page 20 of mr. tapon's offering, i had grave doubts. by page 50 i was walking the book down the hall to the garbage. this book has the dubious distinction of being the only book i have ever owned that was left for the junk man"
1,Not worth the time,"This book is pretentious and boring. Like another reviewer I struggled through the first 20 pages, pushed ahead a bit further (mostly because I was stuck on an airplane and had nothing else to read) and eventually gave up to read the airline magazine. The characters are inconsistently drawn and not very deep and the proclaimed architecture and self-referential nature of the book is a cute trick that adds little. I doubt this will ever be studied in a graduate English course."
3,Look elsewhere....,"This headset works very well. If you're not used to the rubber in-canal ear piece, there are several other tips that are a bit less intrusive. It has worked quite well in the limited amount of time that I've used it on XBConnect.But the price! You could probably buy a similar Plantronics headset that would be compatable with a Communicator cartridge-adapter (which isn't included in this package; you have to buy it seperately!), but not designed specifically for the Xbox for less than half this price. I was very fortunate to find two at Circuit City as they were being discontinued recently for five bucks a piece! Maybe Amazon will soon drop the price like everyone else...."
3,Good but not great.,"This is a good headset. However, don't just buy it if your normal headset still works. But if your regular xbox headset broke, go ahead and buy this one. It feels real comfortable and sounds pretty good. It doesn't do deep sounds very well so most people sound congested. So I reccomend it if your normal one broke and you already have the controller part, otherwise, stay with your oem microsoft one."
2,Not a great buy,"It's got it's good and bad's defintly jacked up in price though. It is like they say a very nice and light headset, but i had major issues keeping it in my ear, it does come with 4 different kinds of attachments to fit your ear, but i still couldn't find the right one to fit right perfectly in my ear and actually stay without having to adjust it every few minutes. Overall not very happy with the product, and i'm probably going to go just purchase another headset that is actually not over priced"
2,Red Ruby Pendant,"This pendant looked much larger in the photo than when I received it so I was disappointed with the size when I received it. The earrings were dinky and not attractive at all. I sent the whole thing back, and of course only received a partial refund because it was not Amazon's fault that I ordered this and was dissatisfied."
3,Small but Pretty,"This is a really pretty set, the reds are deep, yet bright. Is very small, so kind of hard to see when wearing. But it works, and since I bought on discount, all the more better."
2,Nothing great!,Looks much better on the website!My 3yr old loved it when I gave it to her...so I didn't return.But now neither of us likes it :(It is really tiny and the ruby stones are not even tit-bit shiny.
2,Not good as much as pic..,"I bought this 4 ma girl friend's gift.I was certainly satisfied until I opened the box.It doesn't look like as picture.I expected red, but it's pink.."
4,A good purchase from Amazon ..,"I bought this for my wife and she was pleasantly delighted with the purchase. The necklace is actually small compared to the one as seen on the site. Anyways , it was a deal which we were nevertheless happy with. Would recommend as a gift."
5,Beautiful Pendant,I bought this pendant as a gift for my niece. Well it's sufficient to say that I think It's the first time I see her wearing all the time something I've given her. I think she loves It.
4,In-depth Book,"Here's to You, Rachel Robinson, is a very good book. Rachel, the main character, is in 7th grade, has an older sister suffering from a severe acne problem, and a brother, Charles. Charles is a huge trouble maker! All he ever does is get in trouble. He was sent away to boarding school, but was kicked out, because he never turned any work in. I really enjoyed this book, because it showed what it would be like to have a VERY annoying brother, who is always making you angry. This book also showed what it's liek to be a ""normal"" teenager today, becasue it tells about her crushes, school problems, adn her friendships. I would deffiently reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about what it is liek to be a teenager today in Judy Blume's eyes. This was a terriffic book that many people would enjoy."
2,Not What You Might Excpect,"If you are a fan of Blume's trio first introduced in the book ""Just As Long As We're Together,"" you may be a bit disappointed with this one. I read it once, and that was quite enough, whereas I've read Just As Long As We're Together countless times over the past 13 years. In Here's To You, we find out all about Rachel's troubles which include her hateful brother and her crush on his much older tutor, not to mention *yawn* Rachel's many extracirricular activities. The biggest disappointment to me was that Stephanie and Allison were hardly mentioned at all."
5,Two thumbs up!,"I could not put this book down! I liked how Judy Blume always described how Rachel was feeling and what was going through her head. I plan to read ""Just As Long As We're Together"" also."
5,Just as good as the first and maybe better!,What I'd really like to see is a sequel to Here's To You Rachel Robinson except it's about Alison and here life and how things go with her baby brother and all.
1,Pretty bad and shallow,"I can't see any real reason to read this book, nothing was explored very deeply, characters, situations, ethics. The whole message seemed to be, ""Sit back, watch, and live with everything."""
5,Great connector seals,These are the only connector seals I use and have been using them for years. They do the job and last a very long time. Forget about those cheap skinny little orange seals. They don't work. These seals work regardless of a quick connect. They are the best.
5,Great candy-bar,"I love this product rich in taste and if you love a lot of peanuts,they are theremixed with creamy nougat center."
1,"know what you are getting, very unhealthy ingredients","If you are ordering you probably already know what this is. I thought maybe because it had a lot of nuts it would be a healthier type of candy bar, but its not. aside from being pure sugary caramel, the nuts are salty. i dunno who would combine salted nuts with pure sugar like this, but it doesnt taste that great and makes me feel ill after eating it because its just not healthy ingredients. I read that they used to have a high protein version of this called payday pro, but i cant find that. dont think this is any healthier than your average candy bar like I did."
5,Great tavel GPS,This was just the thing to go with a laptop and a program like MS Streets and Trips. Huge improvement over older larger devices I have used in the past.
1,Failed in less than 60 days,This unit came with Streets & Trips 2009 and failed in less than 60 days. Pharos is replacing it with a new one under warranty but will only give a 30 day warranty on the replacement GPS. The original had a 1 year warranty. Proceed with caution.
1,Awful Sounding SACD Remaster,"I don't think this has been remixed at all. The problem is that the original stereo mixes of the JWH LP were awful to begin with.This is one LP that should have been remixed, as the original was done so terribly to begin with. Piercingly shrill harmonic, dropouts, hyper compressed sound.Awful awful awful sound. Stay away."
3,John Wesley Harding (Remastered),I am a Dylan fan and love this album. Just wish he had spelled JWH name right. His name is Hardin not Harding. Good thing ol' John is not around. This would probably have ticked him off.Ruth Hardin Franks.
2,A Train Wreck,"This book lacks the use of good grammar. The plot is unrealistic and the characters sound like they are reading off of cue cards. Many overused phrases and cliches. Many repititious scenes. Sorry, I would not recommend this book to an avid reader. You would be disappointed. It is a train wreck out of control and off the track!!!"
1,Don't buy!! Picture not the same as actual item sent.,First I waited over a month to get this item and when it did finally come in it wasn't even the item I ordered! My son tired of waiting for the headset to come in decided to keep this one regardless of the difference. I have not been able to track down a human to correct this problem so I'll not waste anymore of my time trying to correct this but will not venture into this kind of purchase without the customer service in place we all deserve...Shame on you Amazon.
5,A Simply Stunning CD,"This guy can write. This guy can sing. ""Sing Me to Sleep"" is the most beautiful song I have ever heard. I thought music like this would never come again, but this is stunning stuff. Impossible to describe, though, so you'll have to spring for the ten bucks. You won't regret it."
4,He's back...,"I recently connected with ""Sport"" for the first time since I would go see his great band The Skels in NY/LI sinkholes a bunch of years ago. The debauchery has been replaced with more polished songwriting that would work in any arrangement. This cat is a true original."
1,"Affected and pretentious, from a self-proclaimed genius","I would have given ""Willioughby"" no stars, but Amazon won't let me. Sad to say, this is one of the worst albums I have heard in a long time. Pretentious and elitist, Murphy sings in a voice that is pure affectation -- he sounds like someone's parody of a lounge singer doing folk songs. He tries to hide his sophomoric, awkward songwriting behind cheap references to Ives, Foster, and Poe, but it all sounds like so much namedropping. Willoughby is smug and charmless, it's singer a smarmy, self-proclaimed genius. Avoid this CD."
1,Don't bother to read this one.,"I love well-written, well-researched, authentic historical novels that deal with the Middle Ages. This isn't one of them. I think it may have been nominally researched, but the behavior of the people is implausible and the attempt at archaic language is deplorable. The author not only massacres modern English, she misuses archaisms in her attempt to create a medieval ambiance. For example, she uses ""troth"" when she means ""truth"" and "" thine"" when she means ""thee"". It is annoying and distracting. Furthermore, she changes points of view in an illogical way and never offers any insight into any of the characters or the era. It is an example of very poor, juvenile writing. I wish I had read some of the reviews before I bought the book. I wouldn't have bothered."
5,Circle of Stones,"It was not the book I wanted, but I read and enjoyed it anyway. I wanted another book of the same title. Also, it never came in the original shipment and I had to call to get it sent. Guess I was not specific enough on the call to get the one I wanted. I wanted Circle of Stones, A Sacred Journey."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I had such high hopes for this book-well researched? I think not. Not that I paid much attention, since the story was so choppy, it left me wondering where the editor was, and the characters so typical and unimaginative-I didn't care what happened to them. I couldn't finish it, and just scanned the end to see how he discovered America. The quotes at the beginning of the chapters were the best part-just read those and you've got a better story. I don't understand the praise for it."
1,Awful beyond words,"I had high hopes for this books but I was sorely disappointed -stilted, low brow pulp. Don't bother."
3,Slow moving but a good read,"When Brenda arrives at Gwynedd Castle, she is an innocent young girl infatuated with Prince Owain. But soon, she discovers the traits that set her apart from the other women at the castle and cleverly uses those differences to gain Prince Owain's attentions, eventually becoming his mistress and giving birth to his son.But, Because of superstitious prophesy that states that her son, Madoc, will become the druid messiah, Madock's life is in danger. So Brenda and Madoc flee assassins and escape Wales to a druid camp in Ireland in an effort to save Madoc from death at his father's hand. But Brenda is captured and forced to return to Gwynedd Castle. Will she be punished for her escape? Will she somehow be reunited with the son she risked everything to save?While heavy in historical detail and slow moving at times, ""Circle of Stones"" is a well-written novel of betrayal, religious conflict, and destiny."
3,"An enjoyable, meaty read","I enjoyed this book for what it was - lots of historical details I hadn't known about and lots of action. The writing is fast paced, so much so that the characters are not given much depth and things are not given the attention to detail they deserve (i.e. last battle with Davvyd) - for more Welsh history read Sharon Penman's trilogy."
5,Great historical fiction,"I think the author brought this very interesting era vividly to life. So vivid, in fact, that Brenda's and the other druids' travails were very upsetting to me! I loved the details and description, and didn't want the book to end."
4,A Fine Example Of Well Writen Historical Fiction,"Right from the start it is clear that the author of this book devoted an enormous amount of time to researching the historical accuracy of her story. Brenda comes alive as a realistic heroine of her time, showing the right mix of wit, intelligence and heart. With that said it is important to mention the rather irritating portions of this book. For one, Circle of Stones was falsely portrayed as a romance, which clearly it is not. The rather pathetic and overlooked plot addition of a possible rendezvous between Brenda and a druid name Sein detracts from the story, and at times takes away from its credibility, especially at the end. Concerning Madoc, I feel he was merely a token character that did little to set the stage for upcoming works; MS Waldo was clearly more interested in telling Brenda's tale.In conclusion, I would defiantly recommend reading this book, particularly to those who enjoy well written and entertaining historical fiction."
5,A classic Classic,"I'm sure you already know this book is set in the struggling Great Dust Bowl era. What fun to be taken back to a time I've never lived in, and read such poetic descriptive language. You rarely find anything like this in today's novel; imaginative and expressive in detail."
5,Changing your life,"Every epoch or so a book comes along that gives you a painful insight into the nature of man in the face of suffering and the most abject of circumstance. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is one of those books.The book exemplifies in each moment, between its powerful essays interlaced in an intense story of survival and compassion in the face of the greatest adversity. Steinbeck defines the greatest elements of man, defining the vital passion that separates him from his bestial predecessors. And he demonsrates his brilliance and the insurmountable power of his diction by containing all the power and suffering that man must overcome in life with the mere description of a turtle crossing the road.I'm am a lover of novels, perpetually immersing myself in books. But of them all, this shines as my favorite novel, and has changed my life in a way that I cannot describe."
5,One of the greatest novels ever,"This book was quite simply one of the most powerful novels ever. Any serious reader will be moved, inspired and humbled by Steinbeck's emotional, rythmic masterpiece."
4,powerful,"I did not expect to like this book because I hated Of Mice and Men, but I really liked it a lot. Although slow at times, I thought the way that the plot was layed out, and the strange inter-chapters were intrigueing. The story was extremely believable, and I found myself wanting to know what would happen to the Joads next.This is truly a great piece of American literature. I'm glad I was forced to read it in English! :)"
4,Used book,"Everything was great with the ordering process; however, there was an awful lot of notes and underlining from the previous owner in the first couple of chapters. This, to me, disqualifies it from being 'like new' by any stretch of the imagination. Then again, what did I really expect for under $.50? I would recommend being a little more honest about the range of conditions that can be expected."
4,"Historical, but Good","I really enjoyed this book, which is surprising because it was a summer reading book. I don't really know why I liked it. Maybe it was because you really got into the story and wanted to know what would happen to the Joads. Or maybe it was because you just really liked all the dynamic characters. Well, whatever it was, it made the book great. So... READ IT!!!"
5,Masterpiece,"This is a book that cannot be read quickly. The slow pace of it gives the reader more of an opportunity to fully appreciate the greatness of Steinbeck's talents. This is a story of how people adapt to poverty and despair by increasing the concept of ""family"" to encompass all of those suffering the same conditions. Being united against ""them"" (the banks, the landowners) is the only way to survive. This is shown on the group level by the self-governing government camp and on the personal level by Rose of Sharon's act of kindness to a starving man. Steinbeck does a masterful job of developing the Joad family - from Ma Joad's increasing strength to Tom's gradual enlightenment. Steinbeck was, indeed, a genius."
5,"Very slow reading, but very eye opening and meaningful.","This wonderful book, while slow and sometimes hard to drudge through, is an insight into the plight of the farmer during the dustbowl. For all those looking for a book to impress your English teacher with, or just a historical fiction book about an important time in the history of the United States, I would recommend that you read this book."
5,A True Classic,"Not as good as East of Eden but way better than most books. The Joad family epitomized the wave of mid-westerners that were exploited during the dustbowl years by large farm owners. You feel for them and hang on their every hope and feel their agony as they are used by shysters, on the way to losing everything they have. The tale is so gripping and heart-wrenching! Another example of why Steinbeck is my favorite American writer!"
5,A powerful tale...,"I can remember reading this book in high school, and again in college. It is a powerful book, about a time in American history that was among the most difficult we have ever faced. This book is a story of the survival of a family that manages to keep their dignity and spirit; no matter what hardships they must endure. Steinbeck's writing grabs you and draws you into the story of the Joad family, along with a vivid portrait of America. It's a book that once picked up is hard to put down. It has been called one of the greatest novels ever written, and that is an opinion I heartily agree with. No other book that I have read captures this period in America's history better than The Grapes of Wrath. Highly recommended."
4,Review for English,"This is a wonderful way to understand what its like to be truly deprived of the things we treasure most in life. it helps to better understand how precious life and family are. one minute they're there and putting up a fight, and the next thing you know, they're gone. There could be no worse feeling then knowing that your family is failing. The journey through life is a hard one and every moment should be cherished."
4,Great Book,"I enjoyed this book, but I read East of Eden right after and found it to be the better of the two."
3,Note for Kindle edition.,"I almost set this one aside out of anger and frustration because i thought this was not marked properly and i had bought a commentary. I made this mistake because the introduction is incredibly long. then after the introduction-to-the-introduction, it begins a chapter-by-chapter breakdown and analysis. You might understand why i mistook this for the main body of text when i was 10% through the ebook and there was no sign of Steinbeck anywhere. If you are not a lit geek and don't want to read a complete commentary first, avoid my mistake and open the table of contents and go straight to chapter 1. Otherwise i thouroughly enjoyed this one. I wish Amazon would dump this version and find a cheaper original copy with the original introduction."
3,Definately a long read!!!,"The two words that best descibe John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are long and dry. Although I found the plot (the plight of the Joad family and their journey to California to find a better lifestyle) interesting and thought provoking, the novel is too long to keep the interest of the reader. Intercalary chapters (usually odd numbered) add seemingly pointless symbolism and can confuse or bore readers.Another aspect of the novel that I severly disliked was the diction (an older Oklahoma twang) that was hard to understand.Overall, I didn't like many aspects of the novel, but I thought that the plot was interesting. Also, in my opinion, the ending was somewhat sick and twisted.So if you're in for a long read with a lot of symbolism, the Grapes of Wrath is the perfect book for you. Otherwise,I would recommend a lighter, more interesting novel."
1,Comments from an illustrious dumbass.,"When you reach page 300 of a book and it's still boring, STOP. NOT ONE WORD MORE. Any optimism won't change the unread content. Unless money has been tucked as a bookmark later on, you won't miss a thing. ""Grapes of Wrath"" made me want to have a glass of wine and plot my revenge on those who have declared it a classic. Oh well. At least the title was interesting."
1,The Grapes of Wrath,"The Grapes of Wrath had to have been one of the most boring books I have read in my entire life. The plot is switched around so many times it is confusing, the some of the characters were given way too many names, and I couldn't tell what character was being talked about half the time. Most of the book is entirely pointless and the important part of the story is about ten pages long. The plot of the story is boring, and the story its self is ended in a very confusing manner. If you don't believe me, you can read the book, which you probably won't finish anyway."
2,You're in for a long read.,"Since I am seriously considering becoming an English teacher, I decided that I should get a head start on things and read as many classics as I possibly could last summer. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" happened to be the most difficult one to get through. The story line is quite boring and seems very pointless at times. The book does, however, redeem itself slightly when it is not focusing on the main story line. John Steinbeck writes about the Great Depression from other character's points of view other than the main family the story is focused upon, and he gives some profound insights of his own on this time period every third chapter as well. I would seriously suggest skipping the chapters which contains the main story line, and read the others instead. It would be much more worth your time and sanity."
2,Too Political,I generally like early Steinbeck but this book is irritating to read.Every poor person is all good every rich California land owner all bad.All the Okies need is a spark for Bolshevism to ignite on and on and on....East of Eden and other of his works where Steinbeck remains a fly on the wall observer and non political are so much better don't waste your time on this.
2,"To the reader from Silverdale, WA","I find it highly irritating when others start acting condescending towards people just for not liking their choice in books. I am eighteen years old, and I read THE GRAPES OF WRATH ""for fun"" (in other words, it was not a school assignment) in high school. I did not like it. Does that make me an ""immature"" reader? I don't think so! Contrary to what you seem to think about those who hate TGoW, I do enjoy ""serious"" books (The Good Earth; The Butcher Boy; Animal Farm; 1984; those not serious enough for you?) You would do better to stop making such outrageous presumptuous remarks based on a teenager's taste in books. Obviously, you cannot be much more mature than the readers you criticize, if you cannot handle a difference in taste. I personally love Lord of the Flies, for instance, but I understand that there are those who do not. Unlike you, I do not go around saying that those who do not like LotF are simply missing the bigger meaning behind the work."
2,Snake's Opoinion,"Now unlike many of the other readers for Grapes of Wrath, I disliked most of the book. Yes it does tell the story of the migrant workers in California. And yes John Stienbeck is descriptive. In my opinion the way his writing is completely bored me. I had to literally force myself to read this book it was so boring. It was far sure way to long and also a very slow reading book. This book bored me so much that I would fall asleep when reading it. Every now and then there was a good chapter but mostly pretty boring of a book. His writing is not nearly as interesting as other authors. Stienbeck is considered a great author, but not really to me. Save yourself some pain and do not read this book unless you have to!"
1,Not happy customer,The picture that appears is exactly what I wanted but sadly does not represent in any way the product that I received. When I sent my view to First Editions Etc. I received a very unsatisfactory reply which stated that the picture shown does not represent the actual product. If that isn't misleading and false advertising I don't know what is!!!!! I won't be doing this again.
2,The American Epic,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" is one of those intimidating ""great books"" that everyone knows about and no one reads. The irony is that it is a book about ordinary people, and the language and plot are hardly difficult at all. The Joads, driven off their Oklahoma farm by the encroachment of industrialization, seek a better life in California - with thousands of others in the same position. The migrants are forced to compete for survival, but only by leveraging their power as a group can they ever truly triumph. The theme of individual vs. group is further emphasized by the form of the novel. Steinbeck uses alternating chapters about the Joads and ""interchapters"" about the migrants as a whole. Thus the book, besides being the great American epic about the Joads, is also a social and political novel that caused an enormous uproar upon its publication. This is a book that is part of the collective American conscious and should be read by everyone who wants to feel thoroughly educated."
5,This is a definant must read!,"Just finished this great book and have promised to pass it on to my fiance and daughter. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will learn all about how easy it's not to own a vineyard. Eye opening and inspiring, a feel good book in the tradition of Marly. You will not be disappointed."
5,My favorite book of all time!,"Wonderfully written...powerfully gripping...100% the best of Steinbeck. I have only recently started reading the ""classics"" and this was the best by far. After finishing ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" ""Of Mice and Men"" and now reading ""East of Eden,"" I have to say that Steinbeck is arguably the best American lit writer ever published."
5,Grapes of Wrath,The Grapes of Wrath has always been my favorite . Born in Oklahoma and my parents having gone through the Great Depression brings me an empathy for the story.
5,A reunion with old friends,"I read Grapes of Wrath in my late teens, and just didn't get what all of the fanfare was about. I liked the characters, but I didn't fully appreciate what Steinbeck was trying to do.Flash forward a few decades -- I picked it up again a couple of weeks ago, and read it in two sittings. I was completely captivated. Not only did the Joads come to life, but their circumstances, their defeats and their successes, resonated with realism. Rather than being relegated to the dusty ""classics"" shelf, this book is more relevant today. One can easily replace the Joads with immigrant farm workers in our current society, and get a glimpse of exactly how things don't change. Steinbeck nailed human frailty and bigotry, as well as the largess of the human spirit.Read this book. Even if you walk away thinking, ""What a bunch of lefty crud!"" it will be worth your while. The story is heart-warming (and sometimes heartrending), and very real."
1,"Not just a book, a death trap!!!!","Pee, u. This book has all the makings of a real crapper. At first I thought it might be interesting but then came Grandpa Jode and the book went downhill ever since."
1,Bad naturalism and bad propaganda,"As if it weren't bad enough that _The Grapes of Wrath_ is an example of naturalism, it's even worse that it is *bad* naturalism laced with tear-jerking propaganda. John Steinbeck was a well-known leftist. So what? So was Victor Hugo, but Hugo was a bonafide romantic writer. Steinbeck couldn't even devise a plot, aside from the weary, disconnected journey of a destitute family.Aside from its nauseating politics, the entire novel is filled with filthy characters doing nothing in particular save a near-constant whining about their sorry ""fate."" And the end is so unspeakably stomach-turning that any virtues _Grapes_ might have had are dashed for a cheap gross-out.Save your minds and stomachs. Read Hugo instead."
3,didn't finish. Too long,"i don't know, am I missing something? GRAPES of wrath? I am an avid wine-drinker and I figured it would have some vineyards in it or something grape-related. Nobody drinks wine or eats grapes because there is no grapes to eat. Not even raisins. Just dust. and when they move to california - only THE GRAPE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD (! ), they don't go to any vineyards. They just sit around with a bunch of other people looking for jobs. So I don't understand the grape symbolism. And some friends of mine from high school kept talking about a turtle. Whatever. Yeah a turtle shows up for about a page or two - big deal! Why didn't he call it Turtle of Wrath! Back to comic books for me!"
1,Vulgar,I started this book but was so disgusted by the filthy language in the novel that I stopped reading it and returned it.
1,A Little Confused,"For one, I don't understand why the Kindle version is more expensive than the paperback.And secondly, I donwloaded the sample and all I read was the life and times of Steinbeck while he was writing this. Is this the novel The Grapes of Wrath, or some essay on it? If it's the novel, then let me read part of the NOVEL in the sample, because I'm not going to buy it if I don't know how the author writes."
5,Who are these people that gave this 1 star?,"As a 5th generation born and bred Sooner, this novel resonated deep in my soul. It isn't pretty or heart-warming, but rather a (gritty) honest look at the desperation and hardships poor folks faced during the dust bowl era. It's a riveting glimpse at our history that refreshingly hasn't been glossed over. Writing does not get any better than this."
4,Grapes of Wrath,"This book shows the hardships of life in the 1920s, depicting the lives of migrant families who were forced out of their farms and homelands. As the characters go on both physical and personal journeys, the book shows how faith and hope can guide people through the hard times."
5,Real classic...,"As many reviewers have noted, I had a difficult time getting started with the dialogue in the book. Once I got used to it I realized how imperative it was to the story. Stick with it past the first few chapters and you will see the light!The characters in this book are simply put ""inspiring""! As a mother, I found it impossible NOT to draw strength and purpose from Ma Joad. This is a fantastic, emotional read and worth every second. I doubt that there are authors of this caliber anymore.The ending was unexpected and gut wrenching, but oh so appropriate! I want so badly to know what happens to the Joad family. (The sign of a good book when it leaves you wanting more!)If you like the premise of this book, try reading ""The Good Earth"" by Pearl Buck.John Steinbeck, wherever you are, I salute you."
4,Grapes of Wrath,Liked the read as have not very long ago travelled the Route 66 by bus. Thought it ended rather abruptly though. Could relate to a lot of the places mentioned in the book.
4,Grapes of Wrath is a good book.,I had to read this book for an English class and it is definitely the best book I have had to read for school in the last 5 years. I would recommend it to anybody who likes history.
5,One of the Greatest Novels of All Time,"""Grapes of Wrath"" is one of the greatest novels of all time. I am 14, and after seeing the Henry Fonda movie, I decided to read the book. What a masterpiece! To those who want to cut all of the description, it is necessary. That is setting the mood. Without the description, it would just be some cold, detached dissertation on the Depression. The description entrenched me into the book. I didn't feel as if I was reading a book, I felt I was THERE. I was part of the family, traveling in the car, feeling their pains, feeling their joys. It was as if I was Jim Casy, tagging along with the Joad family. This book is a great experience for any high schooler. Along with To Kill a Mockingbird and Gone With the Wind, The Grapes of Wrath is one of the greatest and most electrifying novels of all time. This should not be missed by anyone who likes to read."
5,An amazing accomplishment,"The Grapes of Wrath is one of the best books of all time. Every time I read it I find new things to admire. It should be among the works of ""required"" reading in our schools. Steinbeck was unquestionably a master of the written word."
5,Excellent Grapes,"This is the best novel I have read since ""The Choosen"". It truely does show the hardships the Joads went through on their search for work and home during the 1930's depression era. Although it does have an uncanny ending, I suggest you read it!"
5,Boring?,"As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature, I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used. I guess it's because great books don't come with big screens, speakers and a joy stick. Welcome to the Millenium."
3,"Love Steinbeck, can't stand this book","I thoroughly enjoy many of John Steinbeck's books. I truly recommend East of Eden and Of Mice and Men to anyone who hasn't read them. This book however I found very tedious, slow, and overall quite boring. I know it's a classic and all but really had a tough time getting through it and after all that work I really felt the conclusion left me hanging."
1,too expensive,I can go to a used book store and find this book for $2 or so. It is ridiculous to charge this much.
5,This is not a review it's a question,Does anyone have the Grapes of Wrath on Kindle? I would love to borrow it from somebody. It's an excellent book and I have read my copy so many times it's in pieces.
1,Simply put...extremely awful,"I am a Junior in High School and am instinctually drawn to literature. This novel was a required reading, but that didn't spoil the story for me. The story did that itself. I have never been so bored in my life. Honestly, I'm astounded to find that so many people ""loved"" this book. While the story did have a great moral to go along with it, it was about dirt! Dirt and migrating. Dirt and migrating and more dirt. I couldn't even sit down to read it for more than 15 minutes before dozing off. What an awful summer read. I even think I chucked it out the balcony once. But please, decide for yourself. Opinions on literature are very diverse, so make your own, and make sure not to operate heavy machinery while reading this one. Things could get drowsy."
1,Not worth it,"I should have known that a book you can buy togehter with Cliff's Notes is going to be boring. I read ""East of Eden"" and thought it was great. I was hopeful that ""Grapes of Wrath"" would be just as good. No luck. It's dull as heck. I don't see how this is thought by many to be Steinbeck's best."
1,don't make me vomit,"This book is awful. Lit teachers who force their students to read this repetitive, boring depression era novel are exceptionally cruel. I would recommend gum surgery over this book."
1,It sucked-literaly,"Steinbeck's descrptions are good, but after seeing them in every other chapter, they get really old. He must be stupid to think that we don't know about what's going on during the trip to Oklahoma. Steinbeck was totally out of line whenhe ends the book by having some babyless mother breast feed an old hag that she doesn't even know. It's just totally unreal."
1,I believe that The Grapes of Wrath way over rated.,"The Grapes of Wrath is 619 pages of complete boredom. I am reading this over the summer for my 10th grade English class that I soon will be attending on an everyday basis once school starts. In my opinion this book is too wordy and boring. They could take this 619 page book and cut it down to about 150 pages if they wanted to. I believe that no high school student should suffer the extreme pain and boredom of reading this book. My advice to any high school student who has to read this book is get it on audio tape and fast forward through most of it you wont miss much, only a bunch of useless dialogue!"
3,grapes of wrath(appropriate title),"I have mixed feelings on how to rate this book. The reality of it and the way it follows the depression are excellent. I give it a five on accuracy and detail. BUT.... I really believe it's only worth reading it if you don't mind horrible, depressing, sad endings. I was very dissapointed. I felt like I was reading a history book instead of a reading book because for me, a book I'm reading for fun, should at least have a satisfing, if not happy, ending. In history books anything bad can happen and in this case it did. The situation in the end was hopless."
2,Condition rating not accurate,"No problems with the book - great story.My issue is with the description of the condition of my copy which was purchased as a used book - this was listed as ""Very Good"" condition - which to me means some minor creasing on the spine and maybe a couple of minor marks on the pages. The copy I got however had a nearly broken spine, many folded corners on pages and had notes & highlights all the way through the book."
4,American classic,"This story truly captures the Depression Era. My grandparents grew up during the Depression and I heard many stories about that time in their life. Ironically, my grandmother read this book and did not like it because of the language. Steinbeck's writing could be a little gritty, but I thought that it gave the story some character. The end is truly a shocker and I will never forget it for the rest of my life."
4,For the Record,"I read and completed this book, enjoying every single page from about p. 120 onwards, but it took that long for me to access it. To take oneself seriously, one must have completed reading this, I reckon."
5,All Time Best Book,"This book is as wonderful to read now as it was when I stumbled across it some 20 odd years ago.If you want to experience what Wilco, Woodie Guthrie, Pete Seeger and others were singing about, this book will bring it all to life through Steinbeck's timeless words. Steinbeck makes the life of migrant farm workers come alive for us, while revealing the prejudices they were up against in the 30's.Sadly, it is timely because it seems to be part of human nature to separate ourselves from those who are in need. If we can convince ourselves that our own wants, needs, desires are different, or that we are more deserving, we can rest assured that nothing bad will come our way.A thick juicy book, with every word necessary and perfectly placed."
3,Dust and Turtles,"After FINALLY completing the book, I realized that I did enjoy the themes Steinbeck illustrated. However, it did bother me that there was an entire chapter dedicated to the trials and tribulations of a turtle. It made a good point, but it was so long. And how long can one go on about dust? I realize it's the dustbowl, but some of Steinbeck's descriptions are a bit excessive. If you are required to read it, as many high school students are, enjoy it's themes, but don't leave reading the 600 page book to the last minute."
5,Still the best,"Some books are better read, and some are better heard. The poetry of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath takes on even greater depth with the Okie dialect of Dylan Baker. This is probably the greatest American novel of the last century. Despite the condescending attitude of academics, this book lets us all in on our own history. Steinbeck doesn't tell us who we are, he shows us who we are by showing us what we have been. As Samuel Clemens dug up our essence in the disease of slavery, Steinbeck confronts us with the violence of our economic system. Also like Clemens, he shows how religion tends to compound injustices. But what makes this a truly great novel is that all this understanding of the world and how it works is communicated by the lives of characters so real and complex that they have become part of our personal history. We experience the depths of our own emotions and capacity to love. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful depiction of human love in all of literature."
5,The Grapes of Wrath,This book was purchased used from an Amazon 'subcontrator' and was read for a book club which is working its way through the top 100 classics. It was a terrific read and an eyeopener of what happened during the '30s in the dust bowl of the American west.
5,for my daughter,My daughter needed this book for summer reading and it came without any problems. It is a good book to have in your library.
4,it was fine,"Um, it was fine... Arrived on time, in good condition. The Grapes of Wrath is my favorite book of all time (seriously). I am always picking up another copy in order to share this wonderful piece of literature with other readers."
4,The Grapes of Wrath,Book is fine. I ordered this with two other books and got the free shipping. The problem was that one of the books was out of stock. They did not ship the other books and finally I canceled the order for the out of stock book and the order was shipped.
5,Grapes of Wrath,The product received was exactly as described by the seller. Quick response and Delivery. Great seller!
1,Buyer beware! This is an edited version for ages 9-12,"Re This edition onlyThe Grapes of Wrath (Pacemaker Classics)I ordered this copy of the Grapes of Wrath thinking that it was the paperback edition with full text and criticism with a different binding. Should I have paid more attention to the note I discovered after the fact that the ""Search Inside"" referred to another edition of the novel? Yes. Should Amazon have marked the photo of the book cover with something akin to a scarlet letter like ""A"" for abridged? Yes. The words ""Abridged"" and ""For ages 9-12"" appearing prominently in the first line of the description would have stopped me in my tracks. The reviews and ""Search Inside"" for abridged books should not link to unabridged editions of the same work."
4,Family Lessons,"I read this book when I was a Junior in High School. I didn't liek the book at first, and it was hard to get into, but once I really started reading it, I found myself wanting to read more and more. This book has some great underlying lessons. The family in this book had a really hard time with life during the depression. But even during the hardest of times, they stuck together as a family and worked out what they were going through. I recommend this book to anyone."
3,Good but lengthy,"This book was one I read over summer because of the length of it. Its a revealing story that depicts true poverty and the struggle for survival. Steinback does an extraordinary job on giving us a glimpse of what life would be like if jobs and food was limited. It was shocking to see what people were willing to accept for a hard day's work. Families were broken up , children were starved and put to work, it was really demoralizing. This book was basically the struggles of a family in the 1930's to make it to the West where ""work was plentiful"" , but later discover that things are not how they pictured them. It was a great book but it was a little lengthy."
5,Religion of the novel!!,"The novel the Grapes of Wrath by John Stienbeck depicts many actions of religion. The characters and events in the novel bring forth these religious actions. A character in the story by the name of Jim Casey reveals the Christ figure of the story. The initials of this character are the same initials as Jesus Christ. Casey's last word to the guards before he died were ""you dont know what you're doing"" which are similar to those words spoken by Christ at his death ""Forgive them Father for they know not what they do."" This is just one of the many examples of religion tied into a novel that does not deal specifically with religion Or does it???????????"
4,The Grapes of Wrath is very entertaining,"I recently read the grapes of wrath for a school program, and I really liked it. It is a long book, but you are kept entertained by how people talked back then, and some of the farmer characters are funny. Although sometimes boring, it was a great book."
5,"I'd give it six stars, if I could","The Grapes of Wrath truly is the Great American Novel. From the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma to the grim and cruel lives faced by migrant workers in California, the story captures the heartache of the Great Depresssion and the power and redemption of the human spirit. Steinbeck captures the spirit of the times perfectly through his compelling characters. This is as good as it gets.I listened to the unabridged audio edition, and it is fabulous. The narrator is extraordinarily talented and completely captures the spirit of this classic. His dialogue is perfect.If I have one complaint, it is that the primary hero of the story simply drifts off in a bit of an anticlimax. But that's probably necessary to the overall plot. Taken as a whole, the story is the most moving and inspirational work of fiction I've ever read or heard."
5,"Extremely descriptive, but worth every word","I tried to start reading this book three times before I finally got past the part about the turtle. It is true that Steinbeck is VERY descriptive, but in doing so he creates a world and draws the reader into it. While the reading may be slow, the story, and the lesson of the story is too valuable to miss just because it takes a little longer to get through than your average Grisham novel.This novel is about sacrifice and loss, great joy and great pain. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of one family and the decisions that they must make to go on.It is about survival. It is about life."
5,"a breath taking,yet bleak and amzing romance.","at first the book seemed to long.but the more you read on and start having the sensation you feel like you are actually IN the book,which forces you to take a break.but the break won't take too long because you can't wait to read and finish this wonderful piece of art that seems contemporary in our unstable economy/world. bye from ISRAEL."
4,"an honest, very well written and sincere book","I had to read this book for honors English, and i have to admit i had my doubts about it going in, but it turned out that i really liked the book, for its honesty and its historical significance, as well as the finely crafted story and exciting plot. I respect John Steinbeck immensely, he is one of the first writers I have ever read that i really feel is being 100% honest and saying the things that he feels. A great book"
3,Long Read...,"I completely appreciate this novel for its historical context and realism. However it is very long and every other chapter consists of overly detailed events, such as a turtle crossing the road. It's hard to get through, but anyone that must read it will at least understand why. You may never want to read it again, although I just might someday pick it up and read it for a second time. You'll never forget the ending for as long as you live. Very well written."
5,American Classic,"I just finished reading this book, and even during the opening chapters I knew I was reading great literature. Other reviewers label this a classic, a masterpiece, etc., and I couldn't agree more.This novel places Steinbeck up there with Twain among the great American authors. ""Grapes of Wrath"" and ""Huck Finn"" are the best expressions of the American experience in their respective centuries.This should go on everyone's to-read list. Don't miss it.If it's assigned in school and seems too long and too boring, do what you have to do now. But by all means, return to it a few years later and read it when you can."
5,Very insightful!,"The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is one of the deepest, most insightful explanations of the dustbowl period. Each chapter has a double meaning, one of the Joad family, and one of every family and the high and lows they experienced at that time. The novel masterfully shows the changes in human nature during the course of the western move, and the corrolation between the turtle chapter and the family's new way of life or Jim Casy as a Jesus Christ related figure (J.C.) was absolutely wonderful. I loved this book!!!!!!!"
4,Excellent Piece of Literature,"the trials and tribulations with the Joad family seemed so real. you are able to image everything that is happening as if it really could have occurred. highly recommended for anyone. may be hard to understand at first, but continue on, you will not be disappointed."
5,A great book for Steinbeck fans,This book gave me an excellent portrayal of life during the Great Depression. Steinbeck did a fabulous job of using his simple style and realistic dialogue to represent the life of a working class family during the 30's. I would suggest this book to those who are fans of Steinbeck and enjoy his writing techniques. The reason that I enjoyed this book so much was because I read it on my own to learn more about the Depression.
1,i'll stick with michael crichton,"Unfortunately i had to read this book for my american literature class. it went on and on and on about absolutely nothing!yes mr. steinbeck is very descriptive, by he goes completely overboard in almost every chapter. i mean, does it really take a whole chapter to describe a turtle! as for the characters i thought that they were all dumb and unsympathetic. and he wrote them with such a strong dialect that i had to re-read most of it just to understand what they were saying. there was nothing that kept me interested in it or even made me want to finish it. i could have cared less if they bought their ""littl' white house"" in California. my advice to other people in my situation: buy the cliff notes. the only people i would recommend this book to is insomniacs, it is better than any sleeping pill on the market."
1,"The Grapes of Wrath, a great masterpiece?","This book was rather long and boring then adventerous and fun. I have read many books written by John Steinbeck such as: The Red Pony, Of Mice and Men and etc. If you want to read this book then go ahead but I would rather recommend Of Mice and Men or The Red Pony."
3,The Significance in the Grapes of Wrath,"I thought that the most significant thing in this book was when Tom was telling his mother about what Casy had said to him. Casy had said that, ""a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but only a piece of a big one."" I think that this is significant because after Tom says this he then says that he wants to stay around and try to help the small farm farmers. In some way or another we are all connected like it says in the book, we need other people and they need us."
2,"Interesting plot, but not entirely developed","I am also a teen who had to read this book for high school summer reading, and I entirely disagree with the statement of teens not being able to read ""mature"" books. I think George Orwell was a great writer (1984 especially), To Kill a Mockingbird was excellent, and I absolutely loved Les Mis, just to name a few. This book definetley has an interesting background plot, and the writing style is very good, but like another reviewer commented, it seems half-finished. Almost like Steinbeck got the idea in his head and then half-way through developed writer's block. It was a pretty good story, but it just didn't have that deeper kick to pull me in."
5,"So touching, so powerful","I firstly started this novel as a schoolwork, but when I finished it, I knew that I was living with the Joad family with my heart. The Grapes of Wrath by Steinback depicts the life of Joad family as a microcosm of the immigrant workers during the Depression era, and Steinback ingeniously describes the workers' plights and ensuing 'wraths'. The novel was so impressive toward the end; Steinback imbues great metaphors such as the baby, rising rain, vineyard, and so forth, and he powerfully portrays the scenes, especially the final one. I, as a student fond of reading, have to say that the novel was one of the few living novels that I have read."
2,The Grapes of Wrath was powerful and depressing.,"Although Steinbeck did a great job getting the reader into the sensation of the Depression, I really did not like this book because it was too depressing. I found the plot to boring and slow as well, to me, it was just one depressing event after another. However, the repetition and drowning effect that Steinbeck created was good in the sense that it made me feel as if I was traveling West to California in terribly difficult circumstances. Yet, I prefer reading books that are a bit lighter more optimistic."
3,Not happy with the paper quality,"The literature is great. But the pages are not well cut. I bought one, asked for a change and good the same quality. Finally, resigned and read it like that."
2,Don't Get the Sample,"If you want to get started by reading the sample, don't waste your time downloading it. The sample consists of the introduction, written within the last 10 years. It is not the beginning of the book. Disappointing."
5,Absolutely Amazing Story,"I bought this book on a whim, drawn by the attractive binding and it's reputation as a classic. My friends thought that I was crazy to read it on my own will, and, to tell the truth, I was somewhat hesistant myself to begin such a daunting book. Going in, I was expecting it to be boring.However, as I started to read I found that it was hard to stop. It's not that the story is compelling, but I truly loved the style of writing. Sure, the story is not fast, but from the start I felt as though I was a member of the central family, suffering in their misfortune and rejoicing in their joys. The abundant dialog allowed me to truly discover the character of everyone in the story.I admit that if I were forced to read this for classes, as well as having to contend with 4 other subjects, I would become frustrated at the slow pace. However, for never one moment did I regret my decision to read it. I highly recommend it to anyone who can enjoy the writing stlye."
4,Terribly depressing...if you have a conscience.,"I admit I love Steinbeck. Fell in love with Of Mice and Men in high school (one of the few I actually read) and my all-time favorite book is East of Eden. So I kinda hoped this would be another love. I did like it, but it's a lot more depressing than anything I've read. It deals with real life, real emotions, and real poverty. You will definitely feel more empathetic to immigrants and the impoverished after reading it. I would certainly recommend this book and now know why it's a classic and required reading in many schools."
5,OUTSTANDING Work !,"BeBe has out done himself. I LOVE this album. It is great! The work is total quality. I have been listening to BeBe and CeCe for years but this is the first solo work which I purchased by BeBe since he became solo. His work on this album does not disappoint. Every song is a masterpiece. I am thoroughly impressed. I love the duets with Brian McKnight and Joe, Stephanie Mills and my favorite song on the album with his sister CeCe. When I saw them all being showcased on Oprah, I went out and bought the CD the next day. I should have bought 2. This would make a great gift! Treat Yourself and someone else. Thanks BeBe."
5,Love This CD,"I was getting married in Jamaica and need to have the original CD for the resort to play. I really love the song ""For the Rest of my Life"". I started to listed to the rest of the CD and I love the whole thing. You can't go wrong with BeBe!"
4,'Gets Better with Each Listening!,"Some may find Winans' blend of the religious and the secular to be a little profane. However, this is a really well crafted musical journey that should garner Winans a wider audience. Accompanied on several cuts by Joe, Brian McKnight, sister CeCe, Stevie Wonder, brother Marvin, and the incomparable Stephanie Mills, Winans shows his versatility in dance-ready tracks, as well as soul-stirring ballads.This is one good album!"
5,The Best Yet!,"This is clearly Bebe's best effort yet. The duets with Stephanie Mills, Brian Mcknight & Joe, Cece Winans and Stevie Wonder showcase his ability to hang with the best singers out there. The music is beautiful, the lyrics uplifting, and the arrangements are wonderful. This one is a classic!"
2,Maybe Next Time,"I first read several of the glowing reviews, got pumped up and listened to samples of the tracks. I'm disappointed again, sorry. I gave my copy of his first solo album away, and I won't spend my money for this one. Why? to have one of the most soulful voices I've heard (fantastic when the Bro./Sis. act was together)I just don't understand why such a vocal talent has to be wasted on such shallow material.He follows in a long tradition of great male gospel soloists such as Prof. Alex Bradford, and Rev. James Cleveland, and If he does want to do ""love"" songs, he could follow the tradition set by Teddy Pendergrass. Too bad those who select the material and the producers are ruining such a potentially great career. I guess I've just heard too many of the great singers who have gone on before, I'll wait for the next release. He'll finally get there I hope."
2,Disappointing,"BeBe has always been one of my favorite Christian singers. His musical ministry has reached many people. However, this album is very disappointing....the songs have nothing to do with Jesus Christ...in MY opinion. Seems like artists Joe, Brian McKnight, Stevie Wonder, etc. were just thrown in there for what....to sound good? Love & Freedom did not reach my heart. This is just another R&B album, not gospel/christian. I'm sorry to say that I will definitely be questioning his future albums. 8-("
3,only 10 days?,"i think that's about how long terry buck has been playing go. of course, he didn't have this book to help him.he really stinks!"
3,A good companion and reference,"If you are studying how the Greek world affected Christianity and how, since the second century, they incorporated each other and formed the philosophy (from which the preasent day practice of Christianity emerged), then this is a good companion and study reference. I would suggest reading this along with ""Beyond Radical"" by Gene Edwards. The reason I give it three stars is because of the language. It is not easy to read. And I think it is best used as a reference and companion to other books in this area."
5,Great Price - Good service,Product was exactly as stated. This is a difficult to find fragrance ordered late before Xmas. It came well-packaged and on time. This is half the price of a dept. store. I will order again.
4,Perfect so far.,"I have had one of these before. Not the same company but its done ok. Its now starting to fall apart a bit but these newer ones seem better yet. I ordered two, that way I will always have one on hand. If they last as long as the other one, I will be more than happy!"
2,Discolored,Not even 2 days later it discolored/turned black both the chain and pendany. It has been sent back to the seller for review. I dont want another one if it is going to do the same thing.
1,NEW - GREAT ... 7 MONTHS LATER - HORRIBLE,"THIS ITEM LOOKED GREAT UPON DELIVERY. HOWEVER, 7 MONTHS LATER. THIS HAMMOCK IS DISINEGRATING. LITERALLY BREAKING APART IN PIECES AND ROTTING. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A HAMMOCK, FALL APART LIKE THIS IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I WENT TO LAY OUTSIDE IN THE SUN TODAY - STRINGS BROKE AND I WAS COVERED IN BLACK SPECS OF NYLON. I GOT UP AND SHOOK OFF THE HAMMOCK. THERE WAS A PILE OF VERY FINE BLACK NYLON MATERIAL ON THE GROUND. I CLOSELY EXAMINED THE MATERIAL AND IT IS ROTTING, DISINEGRATING IN MY HANDS AS I HELD IT. CALLED AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE - WE WILL SEE THE OUTCOME."
3,comfortable but sheds,"This hammock is very comfortable and loved it at first BUT...after only a short period of use outside, it started ""shedding"" black stuff. Like the fibers were rotting off. We cant lay on it without it leaving black fibers all over our clothes! As this happened it also got scratchy where it use to be soft to the touch. It's too pricy for such short term use. Might be ok if used inside or under a covered screen porch but definitely did not hold up past 6 months outside in the yard between 2 trees. We had to trash it."
1,Hard as bricks,This hammock was the worse ever! It was so hard and never seemed to get broken in. I slipped off everytime I tried to get on it and it was very hard to maintain balance once on. The fabric did not have any give in it at all. Eventually the fabric started to come off on your clothes. We just threw it away one day. We had had enough! Waste of money.
2,Product Moldy,"Hammock was covered in gray mold. The box was torn and taped on one end and looked as though someone had returned it before. Also, I was supprised to see that it was made of hard nylon seatbelt type strapping. I do not recall the discription explaining the material. I returned it for a full refund with no hassel from amazon."
5,Spiritually Captivating In The Deepest Sense.,"Faith & Compassion: The Life & Work of Mother Teresa by Raghu Rai & Navin Chawla is a MUST for for the soul seeking! Truly this is the most captivating book I have experienced amongst all of the numerous books on Mother Teresa. The author's articulate biography, along with powerful black & white photography, seizing the endless moments of compassion and love that go on daily at the Missionaries of Charity, are literally God send. The book truly reminds ourselves how much love we are so much capable of giving to one another and to count our blessings, not our worries. I highly recommend anyone to buy this book because it is what any soul needs: a reminder to come back to where home is: love in God."
2,"If she could write, this book might be great","It is quite possible that this book has a lot to teach me beneath the stream of consciousness style but it sure is a lot of hard work trying to dig out those old-fashioned subjects, verbs and objects from beneath the flower-power new age sentencing that is perhaps a misguided attempt to bring color to her subject but more likely just linguistic self-indulgence and a lack of willpower to rein in the runaway sentences and lassoo the flyaway metaphors that keep on buzzing out of Pandora's beehive."
4,Good for the price,It wont last for too long but it smells very nice ... For the money i would say do it
4,opinion,Is very good. it smells very nice and soft. In my case i like because is accurate for the morning
5,You cannot go wrong with this deal!,"For $15 dollars and change this so far was the best deal I ever got for a good quality cologne. The fragrance is crisp and clean, not too strong but noticable. I got compliments on this cologne the first day I wore it."
3,A Bit Too Overwhelming,"Claiborne Sport is a good cologne, but like Claiborne Curve, the smell may be a bit overwhelming. There are other sport colognes out there that are much better."
5,claiborne sport for men,"This is my favorite cologne, but you can't find it in the stores anymore. I was so happy that I was able to find it on here for such a great price"
3,Cologne,.the smell last for 5 hours..very good money spend in this product....I will recomend this product...
5,"Buy it, if just for the CD","Excellent, informative, interesting book. Also, the CD-ROM contains some very interesting things. Especially informative is the Starry Night software that allows you to view and travel to the cosmos in person. It is both educational and also quite fun!"
5,Excellent Book,Authors have done a great job in presenting the complexities of Universe through very basic and easy to understand chapters. Not only is this book good for students in college but to amateurs who are entering in to astronomy. The accompanying CD has excellent easy to use features and great software. Along with some very interesting web links on their web site - the complete package is a deal not to miss.
4,Universe text book,Bought this book for an Astronomy Class I am taking and this book is really good. There is so much information I will be able to refer back to it for years to come. I didn't give it a 5 because at this price it should have been a hard bound book and the current version of the Starry Night computer program.
4,90% cheaper than the new edition,"... and this has all the same stuff as the version following. The book is a little dry but the pictures are there for simpletons like me to make sense of the complex extravagances of the universe. I couldn't believe how in depth this book went though, crazy complex!If you have a class in college that uses the new book of this... save your hard earned $$$ and pick this copy up for cheap.Great seller, great price, shipped quick. Love you guys! :)"
3,Universe good reference book. Got the older version,Wow I see there already printing the 8th edition.Bought used Universe author Kaufmann 4th edition as a backup reference book for this amateur astronomers observatory. This will allow others to reference items if other books are being read by someone else. Universe 4th edition is about late high school/freshman college level. Lots of good reference information and good pictures on a well rounded variety of subjects. No real difficult math. For the beginning astronomer or late high school/freshman college student taking their first astronomy course. Maybe just a tad more math would be needed for a ASTRO101 College course. Still for the reason I bought the book its worth it.3 1/2 star rating.
2,False Advertising,"Amazon advertises this book as the hardcover edition. It is not! It is a softcover edition. The softcover edition is at:Universe: The Solar System w/Starry Night Enthusiast CDIt is only $64.95 under this listing. If you order under this item number you will be paying $35.00 more for a softbound edition with the CD-ROM. Also be aware,W.H. Freeman Press does not and will not have a hardbound edition of this book!"
1,"Good lock, horrible company - avoid","The lock has worked so far. It feels heavy and strong, and the bike I've had locked up with it hasn't been stolen so far.Their anti-theft guarantee is terrible. It's nearly fraudulent, and it's worth avoiding the lock because the company clearly doesn't stand behind their product. To register for the anti-theft guarantee, you have to pay - $1 for a year, $10 for 2 years, and $15 for 3 years. So, after paying for a lock that boasts an anti-theft guarantee, you have to pay for the insurance. It's not far from a protection racket.Say what you will about the lock - the company relies on deceptive practices. If this is how they sell their lock, how good will their service be if your bike gets stolen? Read the other reviews of people who have had to deal with it - the company will not do what's right."
4,a heavy chain lock,"i use this lock to lock up a moped. it appears to be durable and the links are quite heavy.no attempts to break the chain or u-lock that i have noticed.comes with 5 keys, one with a night light on it."
3,Booking a Carnival,"I have looked at this book from a law enforcement perspective. Some of the games mentioned are crooked or gambling games. I inspect carnival games and teach this to other cops. If I came upon some of the games mentioned for the different events, someone would go to jail for gambling and fraudulent operations. On the other hand, this does show one how to set up such an event for your fundraiser. I would hope that those who follow this advice ask law enforcement which games should be played and which they should shy away from."
2,Predictible and an interesting printing error....,"This is a fairly standard romance set in the ""romantic"" coal fields of Northern Wales. The 3 main characters are linked either by blood common passion, and this should make for a more interesting story, but alas, it is entirely predictible.What is of interest is that in my copy, Dot's father has a mistress called Edie, and thus she is called for at least two thirds of the book, when she is suddenly referred to as Blanche. I had to re-read a few pages to ensure that she was indeed one and the same character. Poor editing perhaps? Either way, it doesn't make the book any more interesting.It is certainly an entertaining enough read for lovers of the genre, but if you're looking for a far more spectacular book on the life and times of the hardy and brave men who worked the mines, and the women who loved them, try ""How Green Was My Valley"" by Richard Llewellyn."
3,Thorough Reference,"Overall, the book is a great resource for many military quotations but I discovered after the fact that it is somewhat dated. There were several quotations I was expecting to see included in the text that were absent. I would still recommend it unless one is looking for recent material."
4,Written For The True Artist,"A nicely written, well-thought out complex review of the life and work of Van Gogh. Written with a voice and tone of a purist this anthology delves into the social, theological and psychological effect that this man and his work had on the world of art and the world. Appreciated most by those with a strong vocabulary. Well worth it..."

3,Highly Overrated,"MIZZUNDASTOOD was Pink's transitional album, undoubtedly worthy of a comparison to Madonna's early reinventions. Like Madonna, Pink ain't perfect and this album is a reflection of her daunting task to outdo herself yet again. THe first half instills high hopes, with the raucously catchy TROUBLE (which inexplicably flopped early on radio), GOD is a DJ (a surefit club anthem), and the naughty Oh My God featuring Peaches. In Oh My God, Pink pushes the envelope in having Peaches whisper sweet nothings to her lover, asking him to make her ""meat slide."" Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, a beautiful and soulful performance by a natural singer, portrays Pink in a classic musical moment. Nonetheless, the rest of the album suffers from overproduced and commercial soundscapes that recall much of Avril's debut album. Hopefully, she's calculating her next reinvention to prove that MIZZUNDASTOOD was not a fluke."
4,Refreshing,"This is an awesome albu-definitely my favorite in my collection right now.1. Trouble 10/102. ""God Is A DJ"" 10/103. ""Last To know"" 10/104. ""Tonight's The Night"" 15/105. ""Oh My God"" 20/106. ""Catch Me While I'm Sleeping"" 50/10 Best song on the album!7. ""Waiting For Love"" 8/108. ""Save My Life"" 10/109. ""Try Too Hard"" 7/1010.""Humble Neighborhoods"" 7/1011.""Walk Away"" 9/1012.""Unwind"" 6/1013. ""Love Song"" 8/10Buy this album, even if you aren't a fan. I wasn't, but I am now!"
3,Great Example of Pink at her best,Pink shows her great talent in this recording as she did in her previous endeavors. She has several good songs that show off her superb vocal abilities.
2,Try This? No Thanks.,"I LOVE Pink. MISSUNDAZTOOD was my favorite album of 2001. I immediately went to the store on the day TRY THIS was released to buy it. And it's just ok. I admire Pink for trying something new, and it's not bad. I just don't ever have a desire to put it on. It usually sits on my shelf and collects dust. Unlike Missundaztood which I played out. Like I said, it's not bad. It's rock-ish. But it's boring and the songs all blend into one. I was disappointed and unimpressed."
1,DON'T Try This,"This has to be one of the worst efforts from one of the most promising stars ever to have been released! I'm not sure what Pink is trying to do with this album -- although clearly she is gunning for some kind of Punkish persona having watched other pop-Punks (aka sheep in wolf's clothes) cash in -- whatever it is, it translates into extremely poor production, repetitive and boring music, and self-aggrandizing lyrics that would make Narcissus him/herself blush. I don't generally write bad reviews -- Momma said if you ain't got nothin nice to say.... -- but in this case I feel like I'm doing a public service by warning you: THIS ALBUM WILL BORE YOU TO TEARS and make you wish that pop stars read a bit more and tried to develop, instead of only admire, themselves. Not for Pink fans..... for those with a Pink fetish only!"
4,TRY THIS FO SHO,"If you have liked Pink from the start, you will totally love this album. Pink's voice is amazing. She doesn't sound like every other singer, her voice is beautiful. This album is a showcase of what Pink can really do. She is extremely talented and it is evident in this album. It's completely different from MIZZUNDASTOOD, but it's better."
3,Britney Spears is way Better,Personally I dont care much for this cd however next to Britney Spears Pink is the hottest pop star in the world. Britney is the best and has way better music so stick with Britney.
1,Try something else!,"P!NK changes her persona as much as she changes her genre of music. Her debut album ""Can't Take Me Home"" is an r&b wonder. Her second ""Mizzundastood"" had a more pop-rock sound. This third disc ""Try This"" is plain ol' rock. She trys to be so-called punk-rock but fails ultimately.Not only that but her new look is as worst as this new album. Boring, sappy, songs that doesn't stay in anyone's attention span for more than a minute. ""I am trouble yo', I am trouble now..."" right, the only thing that is troubling is your fake image. Trailer park trash Avril Lavigne can pull off the whole fake image thing. But Ms. Alicia Moore you can't. Don't try this, try something else!"
1,Yeah.......If You Want To Go Deaf,"Oh my gosh...this is album is definitely NOT what I expected. It has WAY too many rock/guitar songs. I know it's okay for an artist to explore different musical changes.....but this CD isn't very good. It's so un-inspired and for most songs, keeps going on.....and on......and on. Not very ""pop"" at allI previewed this whole thing on MTV before it even came out, and I was hoping to like it.......yeah and that SO DID NOT HAPPEN. Even her upcoming ""God Is A DJ"" single is iffy. No catchy courus.....lame beats....Save your 15 bucks and give it to charity or something cause this new Pink sound is hard on the ears."
1,Horrible.,"Theres not a single Good song on this CD. Theres a few that are ""okay"" but, overall, I was completely dissapointed in this CD. Pink went from her original style which included great party songs like ""You Make Me Sick"" ""Get This Party Started"" and even went emotional with ""Family Portrait"" and ""Don't Let Me Get Me"" Now, however, her songs feature horrible lyrics, boring songs, and extremely explict profanity. Yes, you can buy it in a ""clean"" version, but even still the songs are horrible. If you liked Pink before, stay away from this CD. If hearing the ""F"" word gives you a buzz, you might like this CD. Otherwise, its a complete waste of money."
2,WOT HAPPENED 2 STUFF LIKE MISSUNDAZTOOD?...,"pink, Y r u a rockchick now like da rest of them??? I LOVED missundaztood, but this aint as gd. i mean, its ok, but not in the same league as missundaztood. Yeah, save my life, unwind & feel gd time r gd, but the=ur aint no otha gd trax. I woulda given the album 3 stars if i hadnt heard 2 the hidden track, that just blew it all. i mean, thats wen i realised wot shes turning in2: a hooker! WRITE MORE STUFF LIKE 'FAMILY PORTRAIT' 'MOST GIRLS' 'JUST LIKE A PILL' 'MY VIETNAM'... BUY ALICIA KEYS OR LAURYN HILL INSTED..."
1,Nothing to Like Here,"Pink is trying way too hard to shove her attitude in the faces of her listeners with this album. Every song has some atempt at being the bad rebel chick somewhere in it. Besides that, the songs just don't stand out to me at all."
1,Don't Buy This!,"If you liked her first 2 albums, you will hate this one. The music doesn't have any hooks! I hate this album. There isn't one song that grabs your attention. Good luck on finding singles for this one, Pink!"
2,Not that good!,"I am disappointed with this album. I wanted more songs like the 2nd album. This one is too punk and I think the public will not catch on, witness first song Trouble getting no airplay in NY. I'll give it a few more listens to be fair because I like Pink but I may just sell it soon, if I don't find a few songs that I can latch onto."
1,DON'T try this,"i love pink. i bought her second album and loved it. Then this one came out 5 years ago. i didn't have any money at the time, but i liked the two singles ""trouble"" and ""god is a dj""...however i never got around to buying it. Then she released ""I'm not dead"" like two years ago. it was awesome, it reminded me why i liked her in the first place. She's now about to release her 5 album and i love the new single.....so since i can't wait for it to be released..i thought i'd try this to satisfy my pink craving...Boy was i wrong.there are two good songs on this cd. i have already named them. The rest of the songs are poorly sung, poorly written and sometimes strangely/poorly produced. i want my money back but you can't return open cds. she's not a rocker chick, and besides, she hardly has any hooks on here to prove she is one in the first place. truly dissapointing."
1,unbelievable,"Well, for Pink with me it's like that: I can't believe her. First she's that Dallas Austin R&B chick where you really thought people told her: die your hair Pink and call yourself Pink. Then she says: now I'm ""the real me"" and tries to be a Punk but looks like Brigitte Nielsen. She seems to bend simply to fill in the current cliché. It's like she's a walking marketing trick. A bit like Miss Aguilera."
5,Try This.... Buy this!!!!!,There are 2 words that can accurately sum up this piece of work..F@#*ing brilliant!!!!! Every song is different. Every song is energetic. The collaboration with Tim Armstrong has proven to be a wonderful blend. The true Pink is reveled and it completely shines through on every track.I wish I had the time to write more but I'm too busy rocking out to this CD for the 12th time today.
3,Try something else,"Being a fan of Pink, I instantly picked up this album. The thing I noticed, though, is that she tries to change direction on every album. And that's not always necessarily a good thing.I'm not saying the album is garbage, but for every good song, there are about two songs that are just weird. For every ""Trouble"", there's a ""Humble Neighborhoods"" and a ""Last To Know"". For every ""God Is A DJ"", there's a ""Tonight's The Night"" (whose lyrics sound like a weak continuation of ""Get The Party Started"") and an ""Unwind"". And what is up with that bonus track?Still, there are some other good songs to be found, like ""Love Song"" and ""Catch Me While I'm Sleeping"". ""Oh My God"" is okay, but the rap, supplied by someone named Peaches, will have you saying just that. All in all, this album is uneven. If you want to really, REALLY enjoy Pink, pick up M!ssundaztood if you haven't already.Anthony Rupert"
4,Pink is Back and better.,I think this album is better then the last one. Pink is a great artist. I just love her voice. Pink has really grown from her first album and she has grown better. I love everything about this new album. Stay the same Pink. You rock!
2,B-Side album?,"I haven't seen any confirmation of this being a B-Side album or not, but the quality sure is B-Side material. In reality, I'm comparing this album to Pink's Mizundastood album, which was an amazing album. Maybe she outdid herself on that album. Who knows?What I do know, is Try This is a weak attempt, and upon hearing it, I began to do research if this was actually a collection of B-Sides rather than a full length studio album. Could be. I'm not sure. If this is not a B-Side album, I think Pink needs to reconsider what made her famous in the first place and stick to that. She curses in almost every song on this album, her poppy sound is totally gone, and it's a flat out struggle to stay zoned into these poor quality songs.Sorry, Alisha.. this album just isn't your best."
2,mediocre,I bought her missunderstood album that was a kicker this one is not anything never really realizes itself - its not a strong album and there are parts where it could have had great songs but they mess it up....not worth the money. Burn any track you like if you even find one.
4,less whiny with a much harder edge,"She's given up the clean pop image for a more adult image with music to go along with this image. The DVD is ok but not as good as I expected. The actual album is extraordinary. If I could I would rate it 4.5 stars, but I just rounded it off. Just shy of perfection."
2,I thank God that I didn't buy this CD!!!!!,"I don't need to type a 1,000-word review to describe this so-called album. I've never liked P!nk's voice. She just shouldn't have ever been a singer at all! Whoever made her a singer or hired her should be fired from his or her job. Of all of the P!nk songs I heard, I only liked ""There you go,"" and ""You make me sick""... and those are from the first album! I listened to this CD @ the leak @ mtv.com and I hated it. It's just a waste of money. Buy Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper instead."
5,Pink has Solidified her Place in Rock... Not Pop!,"What America has needed for a long time now is a true female Rockstar. Well America, we have one now. This CD Rocks in a big way. As a huge fan of Linda Perry, and if anyone can tell me where I can get a copy of ""After Hours"" I would be grateful, ""Waiting for Love"" is my favorite track today. ""Last to know"" is awesome, but so are all the tracks here. ""Trouble"" is way cool, I love the video as well. ""Oh My God"", well it kicks A$$ too. Pink, you have a new true fan now! My hat's off to YOU."
5,Pink success,"Pink has departed from her previous 2 albums and aptly titled this new compilation, ""Try This,"" for good reason. If you expect to place this CD into your stereo and get ready to hear a rehash of ""Missundaztood,"" then you're in for either a letdown, or a ""wow!"" sensation. I took the latter. ""Try This"" is a blend of styles, from a throwback to good ol' rock on ""Try Too Hard,"" or the grunge/pop ""Humble Neighborhood,"" to the punk-inspired ""Hooker,"" it succeeds where many albums have failed. Simply, the variety works. ""Trouble"" is the pop-single and ""Love Song"" is as close as you'll get to Missundaztood's ""Eventually"" Pink's previous 2 albums had a few glances at her ability to be versatile, but weren't as diverse as ""Try This."" So, what are you waiting for? Try this Pink success."
4,Pink is incredible,"I never bought Pink's 1st album because it seemed too fake and like a big publicity stunt. That album showcased her voice, but sucked as far as originality. When Missundastood came out, I was excited. That album had to be one of the best albums I've heard in a loooonnnnnnng time. Try This is a hot album too. It's different than her previous albums, but she still shines. The sign of a true and talented artist is versatility and Pink has it. She has yet to go wrong. Appreciate true artistry."
2,THIS ALBUM IS HEADING FOR TROUBLE,"I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM NON-STOP FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS. IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT P!NK IS DARING TO TRY NEW GENRE. THIS ONE HAS A LOT OF ROCK ELEMENTS -- QUITE REMINDING YOU OF 80'S ROCK N' ROLL ERA. OH! A LITTLE ALTERNATIVE ERA TOO! BUT YOU'LL GET BORED WITHIN A MONTH'S TIME IF YOU JUST KEEP IT ROLLING. P!NK'S VOCAL IS GETTING PRETTY 'UNNATURAL'. HER FORCED CROAKY VOICE IS SOUNDING MORE LIKE A 'SULKY'. THESE ARE OLD FORMULAS. IT'S WORTHWHILE, BUT NOT IN A LONG RUN. IF YOU ARE A FAN, YOU CAN ADD THIS TO YOUR P!NK'S CDS COLLECTION. IF NOT, TRY SOMETHING ELSE!"
3,Eh..............,"I was a little disappointed in Try This. I like Pink, but I think her lyrics are more vapid in this disc, and that it is a comedown from her amazing last album. It's not bad exactly, but it's not great either. For devoted fans only."
1,Not my flavor,"The first album was decent, although nothing outstanding to set her apart from the sound at the time. Her sophmore album had a pop-rock feel which was not necessarily my taste, but there were some gems on that album. ""Try This"" is just garbage."
2,Pink's Unexpected Turn,"While Pink is one of today's most talented singers, she seems to have lost touch with her song writing & interpretive skills. I truly believe that Pink has the potential to become a legend. Her voice is dynamic and soulful, but on this album it hardly shows. I am truly disappointed. Pink's album is a collection of spiteful trash. It lacks direction and heart. It's great to have an I don't care attitude, but it really shouldn't come across in your music. Sorry, Pink, you really lost me on this one. -Looking forward to hearing more and better from you!!!"
3,Don't,"Not what I expected. I love her work, but can't bring myself to recommend this C.D. Try ""I'm not Dead"" or ""The Truth about Love"" before you ""Try This"""
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD PINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"well i was really excited to pick up pink's new album, but when i started to listen to it i was really disappointed. I know she changed her music from r&b to more rock driven, but it seems like she forgot where she started from. What made her famous was those catchy r&b tunes which u dont even hear anymore. The only good songs from pink's new album is catching while i'm sleeping and love song. If i knew the album sounded like this i would have saved my $13. pink if u are reading this please come back to r&b we need you."
3,Aparently her best. But M!ssundaZtood is best.,"I dont like this CD that much , because she looks and sounds like she is on drugs and she swears an incredible amount unlike her previous albums like the bonus track ""Hooker"", ""you aint nothin' but a hooka.. sellin ya f**kin soul"" and her new track, i cannot remember "" why was i the last to know that bla bla bla you stupid f*ck!"" geez! lay down P!nk to me, she IS on drugs 92% of this album!! I luv ""God is A DJ"" (love it!)The DVD is ok , 2stars i'd say. It has a vido anothe interview which she looks a bit high and a day in the life thing which she has no make up on in a shot. also it has pictures (yay!) the menu is awesome tho."
2,pink's lost it,"the only pink album i recamend is m!sundaztood...on this cd she has too many ballads (which shes not good at) the only song i can really listen to is HUMBLE NEIGHBORHOODS and a couple others...they should make 'humble neighborhoods' a single so people can buy the only worthy song off this album and forget the rest of the garbageDREAMSINGLE:HUMBLE NEIGHBORHOODS...GOD IS A DJ...LAST TO KNOW...TRY TO HARD...and a remix of something just to fill it upthats all you need from this album...(the dvd sux by the way...its just boring braindead pink talking about boring things that a million people have asked and TROUBLE video, lyrics{which are in the cds liner notes}and that about it for the dvd...BORING)"
2,Not impressed.,"I liked Pink's previous cds but I found Try This to be pretty bland. The songs are all very similar and none of them really stick in your head. It appears as if Pink is trying to move from pop into rock and fails, ending up as neither. I like Pink so I had high expectations of this cd but I was very disappointed. Unless you're a hard core Pink fan, I'd recommend giving this album a miss."
1,1 star is too much,"OMG I expected better material from PINK since her last album, but this just sux! She got all her anger out on the last album and this one I guess she is trying to make people dance but the words that she is saying is stupid and boring. I hope she comes up with better, angrier material next time."
2,Disappointing,"First off, I like Pink. But this CD doesnt give me much. ""Trouble"" is great. ""God is a DJ"" is good. But thats about it. Its one of those CD's we all have where only one or two songs are likeable, and the rest are just bad. It now spends most of its time collecting dust in the CD holder."
4,"Try ""TRY THIS""","This album is awsome. Although It's not as good as Missundaztood, it's still better than Can't Take Me Home. She did a great job. The best songs on the album would have had to have been, Trouble, God is a DJ, Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, and Save My Life. They were the greatest. The only song I didn't like was Hooker. There was just no reason for that song to be on there. She used the F word too much. But I highly recommend this CD! The only thig is, get the edited verion if you are younger."
1,Terrible follow-up,"I loved ""Mizzaunderstood"". Fantastic album. This album is a terrible, shameful follow-up. It is nothing more than a jamble of terrible song-writing and loud guitars. No emotion. The only decent song is ""Trouble"". Even that sounds terrible in comparison to Mizzaunderstod. It's like she walked into the studio, said ""i don't give a ****, let's just record some *** so i can get out of here and get wasted."" I would have given the album no stars if that was an option."
4,surprisingly good,"i never liked pink; but got this cd after listening to ""God is a DJ"", to my surprise i like the rest of the tracks as well...to others like me; get it man; it's worth it."
4,Buy the UK version! It has more songs!!!!,"Great album, but once again U.S. consumers are ripped off. The international version includes her hit from Charlie's Angels 2 ""Feel Good Time,"" which wasn't even released as a single in the U.S., and isn't on the American version of this album.Other than that, Pink is in fine form, excellent album through and through. In a horrible world of Britney Spears and American Idol phonies, thank God for Pink, a true artist."
4,Pink Dot delivers,"The first half of this cd is great, I have no idea what happened after track 6. My favourite track is ""Catch Me While I'm Sleeping"". I had no idea Pink could sing like that. She should stick to the r and b ballads, that's where she shines the most. I also like ""love song"", but then Pink gets all neurotic and angry and turns it into a hate song about a hooker mf. uh ......yeah, u go Pink uh huh. Minus the forgetable tracks, it's still a pretty good cd."
2,is this the Pink I used to love?,"After releasing 2 amazing studio albums, Pink really seems to have lost her inspiration.Although I love her trying to be a rebel, I just think ""Trouble"" was a really big mess. In fact, I think she's struggling way too much to be a rebel. She's very exaggerated sometimes...Most of the material on this album is uninspired, weak and dissapointing.Hope to see the real Pink soon........"
3,NOT THAT BAD NOT THAT GREAT,"I was so excited for this album to come out. Her last album was so great and she deserved all the sucess that came with it. But this CD just isn't as a good. Humble Neighborhoods is a mess. Nice guitar work though. God is a DJ works as does Walk Away. I love the guitar break in Trouble and she just works that song. Try to Hard is the best Linda Perry song on the album. I wish she (Perry) would have written a song like Cruz for Pink. Cruz is a song on Christina's CD, probably the best on that album. But here we get the lame Catch me While I'm Sleeping. And what's all this I hear about this CD being punk? There IS a punk attitude on the cd but as far as the music goes, not so much."
5,"Amazing work, yet again","I have always been impressed by Pink's voice, style, song-writing abilities and versatility. And her 3rd album did not cease to bring about the same reaction I'd had to her previous two. This album is- like the others- a mix of many different sounds including rock, R&B, punk rock, and blues. This album has even more variety than some of the others- Pink tended to stick to upbeat songs, but she brings things down a few notches with songs like ""Waiting For Love"" and ""Save My Life"". Pink demonstrates her unique but powerful vocal abilities on many of the songs, and just blows you away with the emotion and feeling in them. I bought albums by two of my favourite artists in the last quarter of 2003, but Pink's album far exceeded both of them. I have one thing to say about her album: Try This!"
4,ROCKIN!!! (for the most part)...,"I have to admit that I bought this cd the first day it was in stores. My first impression was that it's not as good overall as 2001's MISUNDAZTOOD, but I still think that P!nk rocks (though I wish she would quit smoking!). The only tracks I really don't care for are 'The Last to Know' and the bonus track 'Hooker.' 'Hooker' is just plain stupid and contains WAY too much profanity. But tracks like 'Trouble' 'Tonight's the Night' 'Walk Away' 'Save My Life' 'Catch me while I'm Sleeping' 'Humble Neighbourhood' and the dazzling 'God is a DJ' are simply awesome. Why radio has turned it's back on P!nk I'll never figure out. Tim Armstrong of Rancid, by the way, is a fantastic producer. Rock on Alecia!"
2,disappointed,"Ever since Pink released her first ""There you go"" single, I've loved her! Can't take this home and Misundaztood were great. So I've been waiting a while for this CD and yes I am very disappointed. The only tracks I liked are those ones with Linda Perry. I liked ""trouble"" but it got old quick. I love Pink, her attitude and her voice. But I simply did not like this album very much. Let's try for the fourth one. I'll be waiting."
2,A big waste of cd space,"I give this album 2 stars only because of one good song out of 14: TroubleI should have known this album would suck when I heard her sing a raspy rendition of ""Just like a Pill"" on Good Morning America. I wanted to throw up after hearing Try This and I'll be throwing this cd in the garbage. Hint: Stick to what made you popular with that mediocre voice/good beats and quit the Joan Jett/Joplin impersonation."
3,try this???? ohhhh.....NO,"I respect PINK,cos she's the only rockchick in the world make me feel good with everything she did!!!! her last album ""MISSUNDERSTOOD"" is perfect,it make me love her more&more becos she don't care how people feel about her,just be herself.......but after all,she tried to be another level,remember when she was a music star,she choose the R'n'B (can't take me home) then she tried 2be a rock/punk chick(missunderstood) &now,i don't know what she tried 2be,a punk chick???? but it's bad,you could see this album didn't sold out like her 2nd album which is her best so far!!!!!.......Best songs:1.trouble......10/102.god is a dj....10/103.last to know.........10/106.catch me while i'm sleeping.....10/109.try too hard.....10/1010.humble neighborhoods......10/1011.walk away...her best song in the album,i luv this song so much......20/10hope this review could help you!!! enjoy"
1,Ummmm.....no.,"CAN'T TAKE ME HOME was really good....M!SSUNDAZSTOOD was fair....but TRY THIS is absolutely horrible! I am an avid music collector/listener, and I tend to buy all of an artist's albums once I discover them...but this time I just can't do it. I decided to listen to the sound snippets before I bought this one, and I am glad I did! This is terrible. Pink was really good in the beginning....a nice deep voice which went well with the r&b style of music she was promoting. GET THE PARTY STARTED was a really good club anthem...but where do you put TROUBLE? In the trash! I feel very alienated by Pink's 360 degree change in image. Granted, I like rock music....but I do have a problem with an artist who does a complete turnaround. Obviously, I am not the only one....just look at the rank of the album on the Amazon list...and look at all of those CDs still sitting in the stores. Pink has made a grave mistake with this CD. She had better get it right soon....or her star just might be fading."
1,What a no talent,this just goes to show that just because you have a catchy name like PINK you can get a recording contract even if you cant sing. Every time ive ever seen her on tv singing she was total crap with one of the weakest voices i ever heard. I cant believe people fall for this crap.
1,ALMOST PUT ME TO SLEEP!!!,Yet another bad album by pink.The songs had no life or substance to them and had very weak production.I cant find one good song on the entire album.She really needs to get her act together if she wants to remain in the music industry.
1,how dumb!,"why do people listen o people like this? she sounds just as constipated as avril lavrigne. for some real music, try stacie orrico, jessica simpsons first cd-sweet kisses-, racheal lampa, jump5, and zoegirl."
3,Diasppointing,"As a person who loved Ms. Reichl's previous two books, I even pre-orederd this new one just to find out that it was far below my expectations. I really expected much more from such a talented person who knows the industry inside out and writes prose wonderfully. This book turned out to be a tedious story about changing wigs, fake names, clothes plus some old restaurant reviews. Hence, to delete the not so good impact of this last book on my memories, I went back to reread 'Comfort me with apples' so that I remember Reichl's prose as a much more delightful creation. Nevertheless, I will still read whatever she will write in the future and will look forward to her next piece."
